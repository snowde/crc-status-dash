19,Ismael S.,"Wenatchee, WA",10,51,12.0,3.0,2012-05-31,"I never imagined I'd return to THIS Red Robin. Yep, anyone with any common sense would clearly avoid an ex's workplace. Otherwise, it can have a powerful effect on you. Normally, I'd never bring up an ex, but today I'll make an exception. Unlike my ex, who was a solid ten, Red Robin's reputable for cute waitresses. Of course, the service is phenomenal too, but bear with me guys. As for the ladies, bare with me anytime! Anyway, so you're feelin' hungry, but you can't decide what to order? Go with your gut feeling, dummy. From experience, it's important to build a healthy relationship with your food. After every meal, I feel very much alive. My secret, cheating. Actually, the only cheating I ever do is on my diet. It's wrong, but feels oh-so good! Yeah, the bad boy in me is a sucka for burgers with bottomless fries! And nothin' like a bottomless Root Beer Float after day one on my P90X schedule. Alas, 'cause the more I continue writing, the more I think about my ex, visit Red Robin on your birthday. It's pretty fun to see Wal-mart's cheer runner-up. Whoever said, ""There are a lot of fish in the sea,"" lied.

I encounter either extremely snotty and rude teenage girls or servers who are slow and not helpful at all.  If you order to go you might have to wait about fifteen minutes to actually collect your food from the bartenders because they're so busy serving those at the bar.

0,Jessica B.,"Woodinville, WA",16,65,81.0,3.0,2013-08-25,"I picked up our clinic's lunch from here while I was working in Yakima; the doctor wanted a caesar salad, and this place was very close to our location. The doctor's Simply Grilled Chicken salad (with caesar dressing) looked beautiful and was generously sized; while he didn't actually comment on it, he made a point of eating it all. My Tavern Double didn't survive the to-go treatment nearly as well; when I opened it, it was upside down, mushed, and messy.  It actually tasted pretty good though.  The fries were really not very good, but I think that steak fries just don't age in a to-go box very well; unlike the narrow McD-style fries, these sort of steam themselves and get all floppy.  Some to-go ketchup would probably have helped them out; I suppose I should have asked for that.

11,Peggy R.,"Lynnwood, WA",256,420,93.0,5.0,2013-11-20,"""Red Robin, yummmmmm!"" This particular restaurant definitely lives up to its theme song. Great food, stellar service and awesome company made our visit as close to perfect as can be!! We had a rather large party, and we only had to wait a few minutes to be seated. The service was fast and friendly, and the waiter had an amazing sense of humor. We were served our drinks quickly, and the staff was so patient with the indecision that I always get when I go to Red Robin. There are so many wonderful choices, but I decided to get the Whiskey River Chicken Wrap and the tortilla soup. The wrap was PHE-friggin-NOMINAL, wonderful flavor and texture with nice and tender chicken. I found the sandwich filled me up, so I wasn't really able to eat too much soup. But, the soup was rich and flavorful with the dollop of sour cream creating the perfect creamy mellowness to compliment the zestiness of the soup.  My iced tea was never empty, and they kept our water glass full. All in all our experience was one of the best I can remember at Red Robin.

I had a petite cheeseburger and asked for no onion.  I cut my burger in 1/2 and found it had onion on it.  I asked for a new one, but the waitress took it to the back, had the onion removed and brought the same burger back, which was now cold.  In the women's bathroom 2 of 3 stalls were completely out of toilet paper and the restroom needed a bit of cleaning. I hope the manager reads this review and makes the appropriate changes.

8,Dana G.,"Seaside, OR",53,140,106.0,3.0,2014-04-28,"Early dinner in the bar at Red Robin sounds more like a sporting event in a huge arena with only three people in the crowd. Concrete floors, blaring televisions, scraping chairs and excessive noise makes it an uncomfortable place to try to have a conversation.  I know we were in the bar so I take some responsibility for the noise level but the rest of the restaurant was pretty much the same.  The food was okay, burger was cooked properly but the fries tasted old and were a little limp.  Servers were dressing the part as needed for their jobs in blue jeans and black shirt and hats but the effect was lost on me and the two male servers that actually delivered our food looked unkempt.  Overall, it was a barely adequate experience made worse by the companies policy of requiring the ""trendy"" uniforms.

13,Nick T.,"Everett, WA",13,168,16.0,2.0,2015-08-06,THE LEAST KID FRIENDLY RED ROBIN EXPERIENCE EVER - SERVICE WAS PRETTY BAD TOO - We (3 adults 4 kids) arrived around 1pm. For some reason the hostess tried to cram us all in a table that fits 4 adults rights next to another table. Well with 4 little ones that was not gonna happen. Should have been common sense but nope. So I spoke to a waitress and asked if it would be okay to move to another table maybe ten feet away. After sitting there for about 15 minutes with not one person coming by I had to ask a busser to try to track down a server for us. After 3-4 waitresses had a lil discussion over who was gonna take us we finally got one. By now the kids are going nuts and asked the server if we could get a couple baskets of fries to help settle them down to start. We ended up with one tiny little basket of ridiculously hot fries. Our waitress was clearly not happy to serve us and seemed incredibly irritated with the children. Our food was good when we finally got it even though the order was not correct. All in all the food was good but the experience was so bad that we will never return. I would discourage anyone from going to this red robin with kids.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wenatchee?start=20,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088

43,Diamond D.,"Wenatchee, WA",0,5,,1.0,2016-01-22,Went to Red Robin last night for a date night out with my husband never been to this one . It was really loud when we got there . Never been to a restaurant that had tablets on the tables you could order on it play games call the waiter or waitress ect. I started playing with it before are meal came playing games not realizing we were being charged to play them and nothing to let us know that if you did start you were going be charged I should of known nothings for free now days ha ha . Meal was very expensive for a place like this a burger place you wouldn't think it would cost 50 dollars for both of us to eat but it did if we would of known how expensive this place was we would of went to Buzz Inn on the east Wenatchee side  and got a steak good food and more of it for the cost. Drinks were high way robbery are drinks alone were five dollars and over for each  I had a strawberry lemonade and he had a beer that's over the top for drinks most restaurants are high on drinks but not that high .Meal was okay but nothing exceptional my husband had something that was hot on his burger thank God it didn't make him sick. Meal ticket was given to us from that tablet it had charged us for playing games on it 2.00 I know it doesn't sound like a lot but it all adds up and that is so ridicules I couldn't believe it. And then wanted us to give a 9 dollar tip on top of a very expensive meal that wasn't  that great and he almost couldn't get it off the tablet to make it less . All in all needles to say food was not that good very noisy place to eat and prices are over rated there are much better places to eat here in Wenatchee then here. In saying this I won't be back and I sure won't recommend this place for sure because of high prices and hidden fees and If you do decide to eat here God for Bid don't touch that tablet what ever you do let the waiter or waitress do it for you then check it out when it's all said and done so that you don't have hidden fees I hope this helps some one out there looking to eat at this restaurant.

On four different occasions, in four different years, with four equally indifferent waitresses my dining experience here was less than deplorable. On none of those occasions was the place anywhere near 1/3 capacity and yet we were made to sit and wait and wait and wait for our order to be taken. We then had to watch our food get back to very near room temperature as it wasted away under the heat lamps within sight of us as wait staff was nowhere in sight. In short, this is the one restaurant in Wenatchee that I refuse to try again. As you drive down the Ave just look in the windows and see who has more traffic: this peculiar Red Robin or the Applebee's next door. That alone ought to tell potential customers who should get their patronage. And again: if they've since improved more power to them.

23,Zach D.,"Wenatchee, WA",0,1,,1.0,2016-12-04,"So an additional review: we went there today, it was rather busy so we sat at a booth in the bar. We sat for a solid 15 minutes without even an acknowledgement from a server. Several walked past, checking on the tables on either side of us, but literally looking away from us as they walked by. It was impossible to get anyone's attention. We even pressed the call server button on their pos POS system multiple times. They were busy but not That busy, so absolutely no excuse. Eventually walked out and went to McGlinns and got prompt service, I strongly recommend you go there instead.  Old review: Disappointed again. We come here once a year or so when we forget why we said we'd never come back the last time.  - The food gives you a chemical OD feeling after eating.  - The service since getting that stupid tablet payment system is horrendous. The servers seem to think once they drop the food their job is done. They never check to see if it's any good.  - This last time I ordered off of the seasonal menu a cheezy brat that was terribly bland. When the server finally came back about 15 minutes later I told her it wasn't any good. I was offered something else to eat, but since we had onion rings before I was no longer hungry. I was not offered anything comped, just basically, ""sorry that's what you get when you try new things."" RR is again on our blacklist.

35,Gen F.,"Kent, WA",1,2,,1.0,2016-12-28,"I am giving 1 star because our server did an okay job and the food was ok. That being said I am extremely disappointed in the other staff that works there. I came in to eat after traveling and realized my son's diaper leaked through and his clothes were wet. My husband ended up running across the parking lot to Old Navy and getting him some dry clothes to wear. While he was gone I ordered for our family and when he returned I changed my son in the bathroom. I was pretty stressed out and distracted by the situation and ending up leaving my handbag under the table. We left and visited family and I realized I left my bag there. We were there from about 2:30-3:30 and I came to this realization around 6:00. I called and they said it had not been turned in and I described where I was and said that I would be coming to check for myself. I got there and the bag was gone and the table and floor were obviously clean. One of the hostesses told me my bag was found but the other two said they checked their safe and it wasn't in there. I asked them to ask around and check one more time because I live 2.5 hours away from this location. Reluctantly I left empty handed. I thought about it and I knew that the busser had to have picked it up. I had two small kids who make a mess and I know that the table would have been cleaned right after we left. I called back and said I was calling the police because I knew that it had to have been found by an employee and I would press theft charges and get an attorney as well because the contents and the bag were valued at over $1,500 and there were other items that were irreplaceable that my mother had given to me. Miraculously, the manager Cassidy said it had been found and they were unsure of how to contact me which was untrue because I called and I came in and left my name & number and made it clear that I was distraught. I also found it strange that one of the girls said it was found and the others said it wasn't. The manager's excuse was that they change shifts at around 3. I would think that they would have had it together enough to know where it was a couple hours after the shift change. I let them know my mother in law would be picking my bag up for me today. When she got there, she was told it wasn't found and then all of a sudden it was in their safe. So is it in a safe or in an imaginary safe or what? The staff is either unorganized, liars, thieves, or all of the above. I am so disappointed in this and I will never again eat at this location. Yes - I should not have forgotten my bag but to have to threaten police involvement and charges to get it back and the way I was jerked around is despicable. I am glad my mother in law was able to get my bag for me and that I have my keepsakes back but the way this was handled was ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wenatchee,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
25,Aaron E.,"Manson, WA",6,17,,2.0,2017-02-07,"This is easily the worst Red Robin I have ever visited, and it has been that way consistently over a number of meals. My wife and I were ready to give up on this location, but we returned because our kids love the mac and cheese. Even they have given up because the mac and cheese was served cold three visits in a row.  They brag about bottomless fries which is technically true, but they make them harder to get than a home loan after bankruptcy. On my last visit they brought me five fries (not a guess, not a joke, literally five fries) with my burger in the little silver ring. The waiter was absent for a time before I could ask for more. The fries didn't get to the table until we were completely done, the meal paid for and the table bussed.  You should also be aware that they will charge you for playing the tablets on the table. Definitely keep those away from you children.  The burgers still taste like Red Robin burgers which is the only reason for the second star on this review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wenatchee,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
28,Shelley W.,"Renton, WA",7,5,,3.0,2017-05-21,"We ate at Red Robin tonight on a whim in a little bit of a hurry. I ordered the new Citrus Harissa Salmon Burger. It was delicious. Seriously amazing. But as health conscious as I am I looked up the calories and to my amazement it's over 1200 calories. What a disappointment. So, I only ate half. My sweet potato fries came burnt to a crisp. I asked for new fries and my server agreed and brought new ones apologetically.  It did take about 10-15 minutes to get our order taken (even for drinks).  My sons freckled fruited tasted gross, liked it sat is preservatives forever. Ick (he wouldn't even eat it and he loves fruit!) That could use improvement for sure.  Their servers were pleasant and friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wenatchee,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
30,Julia W.,"Portland, OR",0,96,3.0,2.0,2017-06-21,The only reason they are getting 2 stars is because they fixed the problem. I ordered a crispy chicken salad to go. When I arrived my order was ready. I got back to my hotel and opened up the bag and inside was a grilled chicken salad. I called them and they said they would remake it. I drove back to the restaurant and the order wasn't ready yet. They should have offered me a drink or fries while I waited. Wasn't very impressed probably won't come back to this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wenatchee,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
32,Stephen W.,"Post Falls, ID",1,3,,3.0,2017-06-28,"Visited the establishment while in town for work, figured it would be a quick solution.  It was lunch time about 1230 in the afternoon.  Service was great but the time it took to get our food was a bit on the long side.  It was at least 45 minutes to get a couple burgers.  The busser was quick at his job but was clashing and banging around in a considerably loud manor.  I applaud the 5 seconds it took him to wipe the table next to us down, but it didn't seem like an efficient procedure to adequately clean a table.  I probably won't be visiting this establishment again anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wenatchee,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
31,Sierra C.,"Wenatchee, WA",68,3,,2.0,2017-07-18,"Ill just start by saying ive lived in the area most of my life and ive been coming to this red robin for as long as I can remember. At one point I lived behind the restaurant and ate there once or twice a week. I'm not sure if there is just new management at the facility or what. But in the last year the service as well as the food has just turned to crap. On the last 10 visits even if its very slow we have struggled to find our server for more than the initial order and bringing the check. Today was the final straw though and we will not be returning. My husband and I both decided to try the big boss bbq burger, sounded delicious. Mine was overcooked and just meh. His came out missing the bbq sauce and the pork for the burger. How does that even happen when its the same burger on the same ticket!!?! Took forever for our server to come check on it and get a new one ordered. Manager came out and apologized said they were making him a new one. Server brought us our check and said the burger was taken off our bill and apologized again. It wasn't until after I paid that I realized it was in fact still on our bill and when I brought it to the attention of our waitress all I got was a oh no I'm sorry I have no idea how that happened.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wenatchee,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

I tried to call in a to go order for here yesterday and it was 2pm on Tuesday. I always like the crispy chicken tender salad so I ordered that. But I never got it, because the employee I spoke to on the phone was really rude. She was short with me and hung up on me! Then I tried calling back and someone on their end picked up the phone and then hung it up without saying a word to me, no ""hello"", no ""can you please hold"" they just hung up. I have sat down there a few times and I get frustrated with the employees cuz more than once they have tried to really push me to get what they are reccomending and I get annoyed with that. I didn't give it one star because the food is good, so at least there is that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wenatchee,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6

20,Cammelle C.,"Roy, WA",0,17,28.0,3.0,2017-10-14,"We love Red Robins, but this one was a bit of a disappointment.   Don't get me wrong, the food is FABULOUS!   And to be fair, it is Oktoberfest weekend, so I know they're busy, but when we went to check in with the hostess she said she would text us five minutes before our table would be ready.  We left, came back early, in just a few minutes, we thought we would be gone longer, but weren't.   We were waiting in the lobby when our name was called, NOT TEXT, we didn't need to be text messaged.  So the hostess called us and we followed her through the restaurant,  where she said, and I quote, with my minor child right there, ""Oh shit, it ain't ready, go back to the lobby.""  Then we went back to the lobby, where the other girl  said ""What's wrong? ""  The first girl said ""It's still dirty.""  Then the girl still at reception suggests another table, and the girl seating us says ""Well SHIT, follow me ,here, now!""   Really demanding and commanding and very rude.  The hostess / reception staff are aweful!   And swear in front of all the children!  We went to the table, we had the new double taco burger, it was amazing,  we also had the Ai pepper , and the black and blue,  great food.  The food IS AMAZING, the waitstaff are mediocre,  the host staff are awful ! When the waitress,  (who never shows up to take the order, the assistant hostess ends up taking our drink orders, and then later our main order) does deliver our order,  she doesn't even stick around long enough for us to ask for sauce, but the poor bus boy sees, and puts aside his work to get us our sauces we were screaming after the waitress to get.  The poor young man was so embarrassed,  yet gracious,  he needs to be a server, his talent is wasted as a busboy, I want to acknowledge him, he took the initiative to say, I'm so sorry that doesn't usually happen, can I get you what you need, he really saved the day.   Everything else was so disorganized!   My baby sister, who I raised, started as an Applebee's waitress, and is now an advanced Sommelier, has been the waitress,  moved to the manager , to a wine critic,  staffer and far beyond , she has taught me what to expect in food service, and she is an advanced som now in Sonoma Valley, she knows food and drink.   And has taught me what to expect from basic service.  This was adequate, but not basic service. Not what we have come to expect from the Red Robbin name.  You are not doing this name justice?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wenatchee,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4

22,Caleb K.,"Fort Lewis, WA",0,4,,1.0,2017-12-25,"It seems like every time I go to s Red Robin in any city I'm always disappointed .  But this one takes the cake.  The waitress was friendly but the service was unacceptable.   First was the drink order.  I ordered some water with lemon for my wife and I,  and a regular water for my son.  We did not receive any lemons.  Strike one.  They did not give us a kids menus for our 16 mo old son we had to specifically ask not that big of a deal but should be obvious no? Strike two.  Then when we ordered our food we asked for a side of the bottomless fries because we both ordered a salad.  The side of fries never came when the food was delivered.  A different waitress delivered our food so I asked that waitress about our side.  It never came.  Strike 3.  My soup and salad combo was a bottomless salad.  The waitress came to inform me of that and offered to bring me another salad.  I accepted the offer.  But the salad never came.  And last but not least,  The salad mix they use for their salad for my wife and my salad smelled and tasted like bagged salad that sat in the fridge just 1 day too long.  Not too off that it was un eatable but not all that pleasant either.  Just had to pick out a few wilted leaves.  Anyway.  I will not be going to another red ribbon anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wenatchee,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
