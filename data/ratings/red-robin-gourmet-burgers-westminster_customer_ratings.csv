47,vicky m.,"Denver, CO",31,123,,4.0,2012-03-03,"went back to Red Robin in the early afternoon and it was barely busy. We were seated and waited on immediately. As I expected from Red Robin the waitress was friendly and fast. We all had different burgers and they were all good-thick and juicy. We got steak sized fries with the meals but I didn't think we got enough(love fries). It was a nice experience, relaxing at that time of day because it was empty.  Maybe I don't get out a lot but inside the door in the waiting area they have a TV embedded in the floor. You can stand on it and watch TV at the same time. Now, I have walked on floors with aquariums underneath and running streams, and flashing colored lights, but never a TV. I asked them why and said they didn't know. Must be a new trend?

50,Emma C.,"Denver, CO",30,135,21.0,5.0,2012-06-05,"The service is always fast, the food is always great, and the atmosphere is always enjoyable. I really enjoy coming to this Red Robin location and do so often. I recently went with a large group for a friend's birthday celebration, and even with a party of 16 our waitress balanced refills and orders like a pro. I had a Caesar salad and their new vegetable soup, which was very tasty (but also very peppery - watch out!). I also regularly order their chicken tenders and their bacon burger, which always come out great. They also remember when I request no cheese with my order because of my lactose intolerance, so it's great to never have to send food back! The restaurant is pretty clean, though their menus sometimes feel a little grimy. Still, this is probably one of my favorite local places to dine out and I always leave happy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-westminster?start=40,3.124,3.124,3.124,3.124,3.124

39,Ryan M.,"Broomfield, CO",3,22,,2.0,2013-03-20,"First off -- I am a fan of Red Robin, and I would generally rank the restaurant a 4. However, I am not a fan of this particular branch. The main problem with this Red Robin is the location. It's ALWAYS so busy, and it tends to be that way no matter when you go unless it's some random time in the day that's too late for lunch and too early for dinner. However, popular, good restaurants should be busy so it's a catch-22. Unfortunately, this restaurant branch doesn't handle itself well when it's busy. It's actually funny I have to complain about the busy-ness at this particular branch because the Flat Irons location seems far more popular. Maybe it's the service that impacts this perspective? The food at this branch has always been good, but the service almost always leaves something to be desired. I've never had a bad meal, per se, but it's never been a perfect experience. There is always something wrong, and typically it's the general service. We always seem to get the bad servers that get the job done, but don't go that extra mile -- or just barely get the job done. Most of the time they are slow, unresponsive, forgetting items, etc. I gave up on buying the Freckled Lemonade because I'm lucky to get more than a glass out of it. Heck, I think I may have been asked once if I wanted more fries, and I almost never get a side of ranch for dipping when I ask for it. That's how weak the service is. When the place isn't busy, the service STILL sucks. A couple of times I was placed in the backside and the server took upwards to ten minutes just to acknowledge my presence. This is when the restaurant wasn't busy. There were people, yes, but it wasn't hopping. Another general complaint is the sound. I know that Red Robin is a family-friendly restaurant, but this particular branch seems louder than others. More screaming kids, more drunkards. More everything. There comes a point where the family aspect begins to ruin the overall ambiance and takes the fun out of going to these kinds of light-hearted affairs. The Flat Irons branch has always been great though. Good food, great service, and never overly busy. When it is busy -- the servers have always been on top of their game. Flat Irons is where I frequent now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-westminster?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44

I appreciate the fact that they don't make you wait if there are only 2 people in your party and there are seats available. It's been our experience that it's much less crowded during the week days than on weekends. The burgers are amazing and the unlimited steak fries are quite a draw for my hubby. He always gets enough when we eat here. We also happened to arrive just in time for happy hour and were very pleased with the happy hour prices for drinks and wine Our wait person was super.

She ordered a new plate and the manager brought it to me and said he hoped it was better.  Are you kidding?  He should have brought it to me (we're now at 45 min) and comped it!  He was a deer in headlights and wasn't really interested.  The other problem was that the front hostess was telling people that it was a 25 minute wait and there were numerous empty tables and just not enough wait staff??  Or maybe the cook quit??  You need to look at your management and make sure they know how to staff and how to fill the tables so the wait isn't so long.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-westminster?start=60,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44

They have endless fries, but you do have to be persistent if you actually want more. Try the campfire sauce with them! A-maz-ing.  Another plus is that they now have gluten free buns.

Walking in and being seated was fine untill we noticed that most the tables around us had not been bused, and even when we left the very same tables were still covered with plates and barely eaten food. The food is usually great but this time it was not. The burgers were greasey and the buns soggy. Not only that but the patties were not cooked like we asked. As for the fries, oh man. The tasted like they had been frozen, and had no flavor what so ever. Also my husband had only 9 fries, yes he counted, while I had many. The service wasn't the greatest either. Our waitress was nice but much of the time she was busy talking to her friends instead of serving us.

31,Cynthia B.,"Denver, CO",168,116,,1.0,2014-01-15,"During the Broncos playoffs, we heard a promotion on the radio that if they got two sacks during the game, you can go to Red Robin and get a free double tavern burger the following Tuesday.  So last night my husband and I went in to redeem the promotion, and the place was packed (like 10 - 20 minute wait). We found two seats at the bar counter and thought ""cool!."" The bartender/waiter was quick to ask us what we want to drink, but when we both ordered lemonade instead of alcohol, it all went downhill. He was clearly irritated that we weren't drinking, and it only got worse when he took our order. After my husband ordered, I said I wanted the Broncos promotional burger and he literally rolled his eyes and went back to the register. I had to cup my hands and practically yell at him to ask for a salad instead of fries. He was less than pleased.  The food came out timely, and I guess I got the burger I asked for, it was just overwhelmed by the bun and the meat was super thin. Nothing on the burger except cheese and special sauce. Weird.

37,Tim K.,"Broomfield, CO",0,7,,2.0,2014-07-24,"I'm generally pretty happy when I go to a Red Robin, but this particular store seems to have some real problems. I've been several times, and I'd say you're probably safe if you're coming in to eat at the restaurant (though, as others have mentioned, waits can be long and they're not terribly efficient at getting people seated). The real problem here is if you're trying to do carry out. I usually get onion rings instead of fries and I have yet to get the correct order. I now know I have to check my order every single time.  My last visit was the final straw though. We came in but there was a long wait. Normally, we just go to the bar and have a drink and order food to go, but this night the bar itself was full so we grabbed a table in the bar area. After 10 to 15 minutes, nobody had showed up to help us (or clean the table from the previous guest) so I stepped over to the bar to place our order. The bartender refused to take our order, saying he wasn't allowed to help guests at bar tables. He said he'd get someone over to help us, but never talked to anyone. Right as we were getting ready to leave, a waitress finally stopped by and took our order ( but never cleared or cleaned the table). Drinks took another 10 to 15 minutes to arrive with the food taking at least another 15 minutes after that. Sure enough, the order was wrong but now we couldn't find our waitress to fix it or give us our tab ( wouldn't you leave a tab when you drop a to go order with a customer?!) I walked around the place trying to find our waitress but never did see her again. Found a manager who placed our order up under the hot lights to be fixed where it proceeded to sit for another 15 minutes. At this point I'm so stunned that I just have to see what happens. I'm assuming they're remaking our order, but no. Someone finally pulls my burger off the window for a few seconds to dump the fries and fill it with onion rings. I seriously doubt they replaced the burger with a fresh one (our order is at least a half hour old at this point), but I suppose it's possible they did. I couldn't see it to tell but I do know our other burger wasn't remade. I could have looked if they'd ever brought it back to us, but it just sat there. After another 10 minutes, all if could do was laugh. I seriously looked around for cameras to see if I was being punked. The service couldn't have been worse if they were doing this on purpose. Still hadn't received a tab so I handed the bartender enough to cover our drinks as I walked out the door.  I certainly won't go back here, but I'm trying to decide whether I can ever bring myself to go to a Red Robin again.

24,Aurora K.,"Denver, CO",4,13,,4.0,2015-02-03,"We frequent this Red Robin because it is a good place to go before or after seeing a movie at the nearby theater. This means we usually go on a weekend when it is quite crowded but my husband and I decided to go on a Monday night for a quiet dinner.  We arrived around 6 pm. The restaurant was about half full and we were seated immediately. Our waitress was efficient, very no nonsense. Service was good but impersonal . She visited our table several times during the meal and drinks were refilled promptly, but she did not offer any of the usual small talk or chit chat which, depending on your preference could be a good or bad thing.  We ordered the onion ring tower appetizer which came quickly. The onion rings were crisp and hot and our burgers came before we were even finished with them. Food came put very fast this night. Our burgers were both cooked to medium as per request. My husband had a bacon cheeseburger and I had a guacamole bacon burger. Wish they had put a little more guac on it but it was good. The steak fries were hot and as always bottomless.  We also have a Red Robin loyalty card which I usually remember to present when we get our check. I never keep track of how many times we eat at RR but lo, last night we bought our 10th burger so we got one free, which was a nice surprise.

My gut was telling me to get get the Mad Love burger which was a half-pound patty with bacon, guacamole, jalapeño relish, provolone and Swiss cheese, but for some reason I chose the prime rib dip. Bad call.... The prime rib dip was okay, but nothing special. The prime rib tasted decent, but the sandwich was really small and probably belonged on the lunch menu, according to its size. At $15 it definitely should've been bigger. At least now I know to get the Mad Love burger next time I go.  The service was average, but i definitely like the decor of the restaurant.
