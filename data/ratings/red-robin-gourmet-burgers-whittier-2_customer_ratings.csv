186,Laura R.,"Whittier, CA",6,117,1.0,4.0,2012-01-08,"I love Red Robin and when they opened up this location a few years back I was really happy I had one nearby.  The burgers are delicious.  I always vacillate between the bacon cheeseburger with pepper jack and some pink in the middle and their awesome Cod (Fish and chips).  The fish and chips are phenomenal and I think if they didn't have really great burgers I would still come here just for the Cod. They also have bottomless steak fries. How can you go wrong with that?  I've always had really good service here and during the holidays they have a killer gingerbread shake.  Oh yeah, and they also serve alcoholic beverages.  How can it get any better?  They usually have some sport on the several TVs they have around the place and it's pretty loud and kid friendly.  Today my sister and I had a starter of fried jalapeno coins and zucchini and they were both great.  Red Robin is always a good idea.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-whittier-2?start=200,3.184,3.184,3.184,3.184,3.184
165,Aubrie O.,"Orange County, CA",143,95,14.0,4.0,2012-01-09,"I came here with a group of coworkers after a short day at work. It was around 11:30 in the afternoon and only two other tables were being occupied. There was one waitress on duty and she came over promptly to take our drink orders. The one thing I like about Red Robin is that they offer free refills on some of their specialty nonalcoholic beverages. I ordered a Freckled Lemonade which is their strawberry lemonade. It comes with real strawberries at the bottom and top of the glass. For food I got a traditional bacon cheeseburger. All their burgers, wraps and sandwiches comes with unlimited fries. I love sprinkling the Red Robin seasoning on my fries, gives them a little extra flavor. Nothing special about it so nothing more to say. The reason why I knocked off the star was because the waitress was kinda obnoxious. We wanted to have a relaxing lunch after work and socialize. Unfortunately, we felt like the waitress was rushing us out. She put the bill on our table right after we ordered food, we hadn't even received the food yet! She then picked up the bill holder twice when we hadn't put our cards in it to pay. She stood off to the side staring down the three tables that were occupied. We couldn't understand her need to try and force is out, it wasn't busy so they weren't in need of the tables. They have a frequent customer card where you get a free appetizer when you register the card. I haven't registered mine yet but I like getting cards like this so I can see what type of rewards I can earn.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-whittier-2?start=160,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152
204,Laura J.,"La Mirada, CA",45,67,151.0,3.0,2012-01-18,"Joined their Royalty Club, so we went here for my birthday : ) (free burger). Been here a few times before, so l was expecting awesomeness. What we got was not so much.    The service here is always (always) spectacular. We were seated in like 5 minutes, looked over our menus and placed our orders within 10 minutes. Ended up ordering a whiskey cheeseburger, a chicken sandwich and a bacon cheeseburger (along with a Coke).     Got our food in like 10 minutes! The waiter kindly split my mom's chicken sandwich and my burger. So we shared our food~ best of both worlds. My nephew chowed down on his, and got a second order of fries. I at my 1/2 burger and got a second order of fries (ended up taking 1/2 of chicken sandwich home along with most of my fries). My mom ate hers there.     The burger tasted like nothing, l mean nada. Bland, bland, bland!!! The whole cheeseburger was flavorless. It desperately needed their seasoned salt. Needless to say, we were disappointed. The ""crispy"" onion straws were stringy, unedible slimy, soggy things that would hang out of the corner of your mouth.     The chicken sandwich at least had some  flavor, but nothing to rave about. It was tender chicken, not dried out at all~ so that was good(?).    The fries... Ahhh the fries. I picked on up from my basket (when they bring you your order the burgers placed on a bed of fries (like 9 fries, no joke) to keep them warm). Half of it was raw. Other than that the rest were edible. But they were ALL soggy. Like, pick one up and it bends all the way to your finger soggy. Now, l'm a fan of soggy fries, but this was kinda ridiculous! But were were starving, so.... I did take the rest of them home, and later fried them in a pan (l know), added a little salt, and they were pretty yummy.    Our waiter was pretty cool, though. My nephew got a Coke to go, cause their root beer was ucky, and we were brought an xl Coke : )    Just hoping this was a rare experience~ we'll give it another try, someday",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-whittier-2?start=180,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004

Went and had dinner there maybe for the 30th time since the place was constructed. Now I believe most Red Robins are all the same in every aspect but for some reason this is the one we come to all the time and we have I think maybe five of them in driving distance. The customer service has always been good here; I have yet to have bad service at this location. All the waitresses have always been good and they do a great job of keeping your glass full along with checking up on you. Tonight we had Karla who did her best to keep up with a good size crowd of people around keeping us happy and been there when we needed her. I had the new Smoke and Pepper burger which is the bomb a must try (got it cooked medium) really tasty full flavored of course with their signature stake fries and a Dr. Pepper. The rest of the gang got some of the old american classics. We did get an appetizer which is one of the popular ones. The Onion Ring Tower which was ok a little to oily and the onions in side the batter were tough each one you bit into the whole piece of  onion would come out and all that was left was the oily battered crust. I have had other things from their menu as well over the years and like I said I have never had a bad meal at this location. The one thing that was a little upsetting is that all the locations have tried to dump anything that is kid friendly such as the Red Robin that would come out and visit the customers and giving the kids balloons. Not saying this venue is not for kids just saying that it is one of the things that all the kids liked that Red Robin dose not do anymore because every time I go I see lots of parents with their kids with them and they seem to be having a good time with their family. I know this is a small thing and of course they have a full bar and a couple TVs with all sorts of sports going on so yea I could see why they are going the sports bar rout.

Green bell peppers really, I've ordered the salad many times and it never came with green bell peppers nor does it state on the menu that it comes with green bell pepper. I told her, the waitress, and she looks just blank as a piece of paper. After 45 minutes waiting for a salad , I asked her to take it back and take the item off my check. My friend was going to send her hamburger back but the waitress said it would be another 20 minutes, now keep in mind the restaurant is not busy. We asked for the manager he came over all sweaty and said there was a problem but we didn't need to know about it. So she wound up not eating either. The boys they don't care they eat anything. Then she comes back with a side order of avocado?? No salad just avocado. Needless to say we won't be back, this isn't the first time I've had bad luck at this Red Robin.

He ordered a bacon cheeseburger and when it arrived it had everything but the bacon. The waitress didn't apologize and just said that she'll bring out bacon on the side for him. Really?  We all had seperate bills and once we got them, they were completely jumbled up, probably because the waitress didn't bother writing our orders down and did it off the top of her head.

Red Robin is a chain restaurant that is popular for their fire-grilled burgers.

The decor has many American items of memorabilia placed throughout the restaurant. They have a full menu of appetizers, soups, salads, sandwiches, desserts and a kids menu, but their specialty is their crazy variety of gourmet burgers made from beef, chicken, turkey and vegan styles. All come with all-you-can-eat french fries. I ordered the Royal Red Robin Burger ($10.79) topped with a fried sunny-side-up egg and a side of onion rings. My wife ordered the Red's Tavern Double Burger ($6.99) with two beef patties, melted cheese, tomato, lettuce and fries. The burgers were cooked perfectly and we truly enjoyed them. The fried egg added a delightful rich taste to my burger. We ended on a sweet note by sharing a Mountain High Mudd Pie ($5.99).

68,Robert A.,"Whittier, CA",50,145,40.0,3.0,2014-11-12,"Being a self-proclaimed hamburger aficionado, I have to give a fair review of Red Robin after years of coming here to partake in their burger goodness. Honestly, it's just average. I've had my share of positive and negative experiences here, and they sort of balance each other out. The service here has always kind of been an issue. Most of the time, I've noticed that the servers here seem to be stretched a little thin and it really affects the quality of service that you get. It's happened on several occasions where we ask for our food with some kind of modification (e.g., no tomatoes) and it doesn't come like we asked. A little more attention to detail from the kitchen would be nice. The food as a whole is pretty average. This might be a personal preference, but I find that getting your burger as a double (with the smaller patties) just tastes so much better than the larger patties that they offer. But again, aside from some of the more elaborate offerings, there's nothing here that feels unique, that you can get somewhere else. You have to give them credit though, having endless fries (and other select sides) is a win-win situation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-whittier-2?start=80,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.668,3.1600000000000006

This is located in the Whittwood town center next to JCPennys.  I would have given 5 stars a couple months ago but they have been changing so many things that I used to love.  For starters my daughter's love their mac n cheese they had. It was one of the best mac n cheese I have tasted as well. They would also be able to get free refills and take one home as well. It was awesome. Then one day about a month ago I would say we went and they changed their whole kids menu. They no longer served their delicious mac n cheese. It was now Kraft mac n cheese. Really!? I can buy a whole box of that for a dollar. I hate when restaurants serve Kraft.  She was really sad because that's what she always looked forward too. Another thing they stopped doing was having balloons at the front to give to the kids. At first when we noticed that we asked and they said they don't do it anymore. Then another time we saw a kid with one. Now you just have to ask and they get them in the back which takes a while. So what I love about this place is their food. Everything I have always comes out delicious.  I love the burgers,  sandwiches,  and especially the chicken tortilla soup.  The bottomless fries are so yummy!

143,Branson B.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",1,5,8.0,2.0,2015-01-10,"Dined at this Red Robin tonight and I have to say, the service was ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. AWFUL. After being seated, the waitress (Roxanne) quickly rushed to our table asking for our drink and appetizer orders. After asking for two lemonades and an Oreo milkshake, as well as an order of bottomless fries to start off our meal, Roxanne arrived a few minutes later with only a single lemonade and a water (which we did not ask for). After that incident, we only saw Roxanne TWO more times for the remainder of our visit. The Oreo milkshake did not arrive for HALF AN HOUR.  The milkshake was not even served to us by our waitress, Roxanne. About five minutes later, Roxanne returned to our table and proceeded to take our order after we waited over half an hour. The Oreo milkshake turned out to be warm and melted and we were not helped by any employee for another 10-15 minutes. Finally, a server named Juan, who had witnessed that we were unhappy, ventured over from his section to ask us if we needed anything. We told him that after 45 MINUTES, we had not received the lemonade that we ordered shortly after we arrived and asked him if we could speak to a manager. Juan quickly fetched us the manager, a manager who promised he would make the rest of our experience a ""perfect evening"". After speaking to the manager, who returned only once after his initial visit, our food was served to us almost 45 minutes after we had ordered it. The food was the only decent part of our visit. Good quality and the order was correct. Juan, being a fantastic server return multiple times, even though he was not our own waiter. Our actual waitress, Roxanne, returned only once more, just to give us the check.  We received horrible service both from our waitress and the manager, who did not once offer any sort of discount or comp. any item we had been waiting for. As we left the restaurant, we were followed out by the manager who proceeded to offer us a coupon for an appetizer, which turned out to be EXPIRED.  Our experience was absolutely HORRID. The only reason I have rated this restaurant 2 stars instead of 1, is for Juan, who is obviously an experienced server who was both kind, polite, and generous, although he was not our waiter.

I also do not like that they want me to pay at the iPad type thing at the table. I asked about dessert and he said it is on their and pointed to it Red Robin Pad. What the heck?

Ordered our food and took almost ANOTHER 40 mins for a burger and if I remember correctly a chicken salad for my girl. Now here is how I am as a person, no matter how hungry I am, I will still eat the food provided to me because I cant bother arguing with a waiter who prolly hates their job to send food back cold to prolly either A) spit in my new redone food B) take even longer to cook up a new batch of food. My burger was so cold that Im surprised it wasnt sitting on a bed of ice cubes than a heat lamp, the gf's salad was mediocre considering it was lettuce n chicken. Of course my tip, if there was even one justified my satisfaction this place.

I observed quite a few things that ultimately made me lose my appetite. The bartender was wiping down counters, soda fountains with the same dirty towel then proceeded to make customers drinks without washing her hands, grabbing glasses from the rim and putting lemons/cherries on the glasses. What looked like the manager, she was refilling the ice area in the bar using buckets that she placed on the floor and proceeded to grab the bucket from the bottom and dumping the ice in the ice bin. After doing that, the proceeded to mix an alcoholic drink for a costumer in the same method as the other employee without washing her hands. The servers were also back and forth in the bar area getting sodas, juice, shakes, etc and were grabbing the holders that they put the customer bills in that everyone has grabbed/touched and they also proceeded to get glasses by the rim, grabbing the straws by the end where we all put our mouth on and were also placing lemons in certain drinks with no hand washing what so ever. I saw the bus boy cleaning tables, clearing the dirty dishes, carrying the plastic bin they put the dirty dishes in. He then proceeded to pull a paper ""to go"" cup to serve a drink and a stack of cups fell and instead of tossing them, he placed them back on the counter grabbing them from the rim as well. I also saw one of the servers placing an order using the touch screen, rub the whole side of her face then grab a cup and straw and gave that drink to a customer.  Will never go back here again and for those of you who enjoy going there for the great food, pay attention to how no one seems to wash their hands but touch everything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-whittier-2?start=140,3.2,3.02,3.02,2.468,3.0920000000000005

A young man came by and said ""Here you go"" and handed us some menu's, but never said if he was our waiter, WHEN our waiter would get there, or WHO it was. We pushed the ""Call the Server"" button. Nothing. We sat there and waited...waited....waited. Finally I suggested to my boyfriend that we sit at the bar if we EVER wanted to get service (since the bartender was the only employee in the room) and, sure enough, we were asked if we wanted drinks, what we'd like to order, etc. The bartender was not friendly, but maybe that was due to the fact that she and the chef's were the only ones in the joint actually WORKING. Throughout my visit I saw plenty of employees grouped up in little cliques chatting; from my chair I was able to see employees standing around texting in the kitchen for 10 minutes at a time; and when I left, as a nice farewell, the 2 employees leaning on the ""host"" stand, chatting, did not say a word as we walked out. I called out behind me ""Yeah, you're welcome, have a nice day too!"" Not once in my entire visit did I see one. freaking. manager.  Managers of RR, I live less than a mile away, and my boyfriend lives less than 2 miles away.

So to our surprise, the host asked us if we were 21 (Ehem! I'll take a compliment any day) and immediately sat us at the bar area.  We ordered water and an appetizer of salsa, guac, and chips. I didn't care much for the salsa but the chips and guac were yummy.   After a few minutes we finally decided on our order. I got the Whiskey Bbq Burger with a Boca patty and my friend ordered the chicken California burger.  As my friend and I chatted away and devoured the appetizer, we noticed that are food had yet to arrive. We waited a few minutes more and the waitress from the bar area told us it would be a few more minutes. So we continued to wait... And wait... And when I finally checked the time it had been about 40 minutes since we ordered. Yikes!!!!   We finally got our order and it was warm and delicious. Although my friend did point out they forgot her bacon.  I'm not a fan of bacon but I figured that for anyone that is a fan that may be a big deal. Not even a couple minutes after discussing the bacon situation, the manager comes over to apologize for the delay. He was super friendly and explained that there was a mix up with our order. He asked if there was anything we needed and I mentioned that my friend didn't get her bacon. The manager goes ahead and immediately brings her over some bacon and proceeds to tell her that her meal is taken care of! WOW!!!    So... As We finally finish our meal and my friend finishes her story about a horrible experience at an Apple Bee's in Santa Ana, our friendly waitress comes over to ask if we need anything else. She also apologizes for the delay with our food and proceeds to tell us that our entire meal was taken care of.  DOUBLE WOW!!! We definitely did not expect that.  And this is why I LOVE me some Red Robin. And yes, although the wait was long they definitely made up for it. I had to give them 5 stars for the delicious food, owning up to their mistake and making up for it with a comped meal.

Yesterday I visited Red Robin with a friend to grab a bite for lunch and WOW. Our waiter was awesome! His name was Juan, but he was super polite and our drinks were never empty. That is the definition of a good waiter or waitress. Drinks always have to be filled. But I ordered my usual, the bbq whiskey chicken wrap. I usually get a little side of jalapeno coins, but it seems like recently they aren't doing that anymore so I have to order that as an appetizer. But Juan here said he can get me a little side of them.

The first batch perfect. The second batch were truly burnt. They never should've made it out of the kitchen. That's why they lost one star. The place was clean as usual the selection was wonderful.

Then there was a hair in my wedge salad. Once I notified the server she brought a replacement salad AFTER my cold meal came? She went on to say the manager would take off both salads? WTF, you're gonna charge me for a replacement & hairy salad? On top of that, the replacement salad-piece of lettuce wedge-was rotten on the bottom. Do they even look at what they are serving customers??  Also, my daughter found a piece of lettuce in her FRUIT salad, why? My guess is they're so busy their food line must be all tossed up & getting mixed together.  I came to this location since the La Habra one seems to have an issue with water bugs that come out while guest are eating. Check out that review! Not sure if my biggest regret was coming here Friday or not taking pictures of the mess since I was trying to enjoy the evening with my daughter.

On my last visit, we stopped by around 8 pm on a week day. The restaurant was pretty empty except for the MNF crowd at the bar and a few tables in the dining area, so it was not busy for sure. We started off with some fried pickles and our drinks (this is always our order). The pickles and drinks came out, the pickles were looking like chocolate. They were super burnt, that even the ring around the pickle on the inside was black. Shortly after our food came out, everything was spot on about our order. All the special requests were accommodated. We asked the young girl who brought out our food for refills as our waiter had not came back to our table to see if we needed anything. After she came back with the refills our waiter still never stopped by again. Not even to offer more fries, because c'mon who eats only one basket of fries at RR? Overall, besides our pickles the food was spot on RR goodness. The service was really non-existent which made the dining experience a little rough per se.
