20,Jessie E.,"Wichita Falls, TX",15,1,,4.0,2016-10-14,I am so excited to see this restaurant come to wichita falls. Wasnlucky enough to go to their training open today and enjoyed an amazing lunch. The food and service were both great! Our server was nervous as it was only her 3rd day of work but she still did a great job ! Cant wait to enjoy many meals with my family there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita-falls?start=20,1.904,1.904,1.904,1.904,1.9040000000000001
11,Amanda S.,"Ocean City, MD",3,3,,1.0,2016-10-20,"Was so disappointed with this place! It took 20 minutes for our waitress to order our drinks, and we never saw her again (like I'm not kidding one of the hostesses brought us our dinner), and our food was undercooked after a whole hour of waiting! I was so excited that we finally got a Red Robins here too...but I will NOT be going here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita-falls,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001
22,Jane E.,"Wichita Falls, TX",0,17,,3.0,2016-10-22,"I attended the soft opening today at lunch. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful, but actual service a tad bit slow but I am not complaining! Food was to die for! Our burgers were cooked perfectly and were extremely juicy. I love a messy burger and this did not disappoint!  Fries were hot and delicious. We got the mud pie to go and it is amazing!  Once opened, I think this will be a great place to meet friends for drinks too. They have a nice drink menu. Easy ordering and paying electronically at the table is a huge plus. Sign up for the royalty program and get a free jar of their spice blend! Update - we returned 10/22 as paying customers. Food was still great but service is horrible! Took forever to get a server to our table after being seated and then things kept going downhill service wise.  We were delivered our orders of endless fries after all our other plates had been cleared and we were ready to leave even though we had requested them the minute our original orders were delivered, which also took forever and a day. When we asked our server for extra napkins and to bring us a full ketchup bottle, because ours was empty when we sat down, she seemed very annoyed.  If service does not improve, this restaurant will not survive no matter how good the food is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita-falls?start=20,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002
9,Scott V.,"Burkburnett, TX",0,7,,2.0,2016-10-28,"I love red robin, but this one still has a long way to go before i will come back.  Confusion at the hostess table to get our seats. Waited for about 8 minutes before we saw a waitress.  Appatizers took forever to get to the table.  We had pretzel bites.  Then our food took another 30 minutes or so before it got to the table.  Once here the burgers were over done.  Food taste wise was still good but service was average to below average.  Wait times were not worth the headache and annoyance of waiting for the food.  They need some practice so trust me and go elsewhere unless you are one of the only ones in the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita-falls,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000004
15,John J.,"Anchorage, AK",35,33,41.0,1.0,2016-11-03,Good food by horribly SLOW service by Jennifer.  10 minutes to be seated.  20 minutes to get water at our table. 40 minutes to get our food.  They weren't that busy and Jennifer was pleasant but too absent and too slow.  DON'T EAT HERE unless you have 90 minutes to waste.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita-falls,,,,,
13,Carter M.,"Kyle, TX",6,132,73.0,1.0,2016-11-04,I walked in and it was only 30 minutes after they opened. It was a Sunday so it was already packed. When I was seated with my daughter. It took about 10 minutes to be greeted and asked for drinks. I even had another table right next to us be seated after us attended to before our table was. So of course my daughter sees a tablet looking item on the table. So she begins to play with it. Immediately when the waitress came she said the games are $1.99. N I asked if it's already authorized and she said as soon as they. Even playing that it's automatically charged. Crazy. So there's no protection from having families charged without their consent? She offered to take it off but it's still ridiculous. Olive Garden has the same set up and they don't charge for games. At least I wasn't billed. My daughter ordered a cheeseburger and they forgot the cheese. When I asked about it. The waitress literally brought a cold slice of cheese on a plate. Crazy!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita-falls,,,,,
12,Tom P.,"Electra, TX",0,9,,1.0,2016-11-06,This place has a lot to be desired. The service is compatible to clucky cheezzz. Had to beg for napkins for our table of 4 after appetizers and and food had been brought out. Forget about the bottomless fries unless you don't mind waiting 30 min after you ask for them. We will never return!!!!!! This was our first time to visit a Red Robin and will be our last.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita-falls,,,,,
23,B G.,"Wichita Falls, TX",0,22,1.0,1.0,2016-11-10,"My husband went there for lunch and we're very dissatisfied. We asked to not be seated next to kids due to the fact that it was just myself and husband and we wanted a ""date"" atmosphere. We were treated like it was a sin to ask that. When we finally got our food my husband's hamburger was so messy that he had to lean over the plate to eat a hamburger. The worst part was overhearing a guy that seemed to be a manager because he was telling others what to do, say ""why are all these stupid conservatives in here?"" I turned around to look at the people in there and saw a lot of older people and veterans. tomorrow is veterans day and that is very disrespectful!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita-falls?start=20,,,,,
21,Purple G.,"Wichita Falls, TX",0,4,,1.0,2016-11-10,"first visit made me mad. Don't usually complain but, a skinny guy with pointy hair cut and really expressed eye brows popped off. Said"" why are all these stupid Conservatives in here, geez. As a combat veteran I  will not grace your obvious politically driven one sided establishment again. I don't want to hear your crap while I try to eat. So we will let everyone know exactly how it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita-falls?start=20,,,,,
7,Krystle H.,"Wichita Falls, TX",25,50,14.0,3.0,2016-11-13,"The food was awesome, I had the blue ribbon burger but wedgie style so no bun. The only thing I can complain about is the slow service. The server was hardly around. I had to ask for refills and never got one for myself. I also paid the upcharge for a particular dipping sauce and had to ask 2x for it. I had already finished my wedge burger before it came out. I will try again on a less busy day and hope service is better or more attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita-falls,,,,,
8,Reisha H.,"Wichita Falls, TX",45,1,,1.0,2016-11-13,Left my wallet.  Called  about an hour later and was told that the server had turned it in .  Went back to pick it up only to find that I had several hundred dollars missing.  Was assured by management that it had gone straight from the server to the office.  I won't go back .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita-falls,,,,,
14,Debbie B.,"Wichita Falls, TX",0,1,,2.0,2016-11-21,"We went early evening, and were just one of three tables in the place.  We were proptly seated,  service was good.   Never was offered drink refills.  When we asked, they never came.  The Fish and Chips were great.  How ever the ""bottomless"" fries were not upgraded (that we paid  an upgrade for) as the original order.  My husbands LG SIZE burger was a single 6oz patty , even though the picture on the menu showed a double meat.  When he asked the waitress she told him the double meat was 2  2.5 oz patties for $6.99  or 1  6 oz patty for the large at $2 upcharge, if you want the large double meat its an ADDITIONAL $4 for the second 6 oz patty ( before its cooked by the way)! Next time we will walk next door where you get a double meat burger for $8.99  and  not be hungary in 2 hrs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita-falls,,,,,
16,Bee Z.,"Oklahoma City, OK",5,140,35.0,4.0,2016-11-29,"Food is amazing. Had the Caesar chicken wrap, BBQ chicken wrap, and a grilled cheese and it was great. The service was slow though and it was kinda expensive. I would definitely go back though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita-falls,,,,,
26,K L.,"Wichita Falls, TX",0,12,,2.0,2016-12-15,"We have eaten at many Red Robins and were excited we'd finally have one close by.  A month or so ago we were in - only 3 of us in our party.  We waited 30+ minutes for our food. I ordered the healthy Wedgie but it came out covered in mayo...totally not healthy.  I had planned to just eat it but my husband insisted they remake it.  I told the manager I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for my burger but he assured me my remake would be first on the kitchen's list.  Needless to say, 30 minutes later I still had no food.  I asked the manager to make it to go since the rest of my party had finished eating.  This week we tried again. We were there right at 5:30. There were hardly any customers yet it still took 45 minutes to get our food.  There were 8 of us this time. When someone would ask for a refill on fries the waitress would bring 1 small basket to place in the middle.  When she was asked to bring several baskets at a time, she said we needed to ""share"" the 1 basket first.  Then she disappeared for a long time.  Service and food times are just not worth visiting this Red Robin. It's very sad!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita-falls?start=20,,,,,
24,Brian T.,"Wichita Falls, TX",0,8,,2.0,2017-01-05,"My family has been 4 times since they opened. We like the menu, and the food is good! The problem is the long long wait times for the food to arrive at the table. We have gone for dinner between 5:00-5:30 for every visit and have been seated right away. The waitress staff has all been nice, but all have apologized for the long wait times.  The last time we went it took so long that we asked for the food to be put in to go boxes so we could leave. During my first visit I signed up for the reward points and I was supposed to get a free burger the last time we were there for my birthday but the table side computer charged me for my burger. Maybe I was supposed to tell the waitress but we had been waiting for so long for our food to arrive that we just wanted to pay and leave. Hopefully management will consider changing something in order to avoid these long wait times. But until then, we're taking an extended break from Red Robin's. I have not experienced this problem at other Red Robin's restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita-falls?start=20,,,,,
27,Dolch M.,"Sandy, OR",0,12,,2.0,2017-01-12,"high priced, over rated, nothing to write home about. slow to serve, has table side billing and payment scheme. won't be going back, as I make better burgers than they do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita-falls?start=20,,,,,
17,Dylan D.,"Shreveport, LA",79,2,,2.0,2017-01-16,Maybe it's just me but the wait time was very long.. the burger wasn't awful but I wasn't the best I've ever had and the fries are just gross which is why I assume they're bottomless... for anyone reading this try somewhere else.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita-falls,,,,,
25,Brad C.,"Iowa Park, TX",0,7,,1.0,2017-01-18,"Went last Sunday with my wife and grandkids.  Seated quickly (there were only about 10-15 others there) but had to wait forever to be waited on.  Finally Ruby arrived and said she'd be ""right back"" to take our drink order.  Seven minutes later she came back, took our drink order and left again.  Five minutes later we get our drinks and she takes our food order.  Kids needed refills before food arrived, refills were not offered so we had to ask, food finally arrives and is less than over-whelming.  Finally got napkins, silverware and refills 10 minutes after food arrived.  Waitress seemed to just disappear......despite poor service and less than exceptional food I added a $5.00 dollar tip on the bill and paid with a credit card.  Just saw the charge on my credit statement and someone added an additional $2.00 to the tip!!  Guess I just didn't leave enough.  Will not be going back.  Really a shame, we have eaten at Red Robins in other places and everything was great.....don't see this one lasting very long with that high mall rent I'm sure they are paying.  If Smashburger couldn't make a go of it, neither will this Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita-falls?start=20,,,,,
5,Darby J.,"Wichita Falls, TX",8,17,5.0,1.0,2017-01-21,"First of all, Im not sure why I go back. It's new in town so people want to try it, I also had received a gift card as well. But every time has been bad. Service is terrible, food is mediocre at best. This last time was so bad that it sparked me to leave this review in hopes to save someone else from the misery. Can't get a drink refill, cant get a fry refill, no extra plates for appetizers, no napkins, overpriced, greasy over-cooked burgers. All around bad time, ill ensure this is the last time they burn me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita-falls,,,,,
19,Dustin N.,"Wichita Falls, TX",97,67,44.0,3.0,2017-01-22,"I tried out the new Red Robin in the mall over a business lunch. We arrived around noon, were greeted at the door and led through the mostly empty restaurant. Not a great sign but I figured maybe it just hasn't caught I yet. I have never eaten at a Red Robin but I have seen the commercials and people seemed to enjoy it during the soft opening. We were seated and our server met with us in just a minute. She got our orders and left us to look over the menu. When she came back I ordered the tavern double burger with no bun and a side of steamed broccoli. The waitress offered to have the burger in a lettuce wrap at no charge but I prefer to just eat with a knife and fork. They had our food out pretty quickly and the waitress wasn't intrusive while we were discussing business. The burger was fine but the quality wasn't much better than fast food. The side of broccoli was good and sides are bottomless, but there is only so much broccoli I want to eat in one sitting. The good: at $6.99 the burger was a cheap lunch in a sit down environment with the availability of real veggies as a side. It just wasn't better than many of the other options available in town. I'd come back again if someone suggests it but it won't be a go-to lunch spot for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita-falls,,,,,
3,John D.,"Wichita Falls, TX",0,12,4.0,1.0,2017-02-25,"Where do I start, so much was wrong. We were led into the dining room and shown to a table. When I said we preferred a booth, I was told ""that section is closed"".  I wasn't asking to sit on the other side of the restaurant, just in a booth adjacent to where we were placed.  It's noon on a Saturday, I would think all sections would be open. Funny, others were seated in these booths while we eating.  So much for customer service. Then the bad news arrived, the poorly trained server that we had the last time, Whitney. We tried to order the featured drink on the menu, only to be told they didn't have the ingredients to make it - so much for the money corporate spent developing and promoting this cocktail!  So we made a different selection only to have our server get our drink order wrong, she did the same thing last time we were here. I had to ask for the Ziosk device that is used to reorder drinks and pay the bill.  I thought the Ziosk would have speeded things up.  It did not, the waitress would come by often enough but never come by with food or drink.  Even our meal was delivered by someone else.  This is probably good because our server would have let it sit at the pass like she did last time.  The only good thing was the food, excellent burgers.  But will this be enough for people to overlook the poor service? To the management - fire Whitney To Red Robin corporate - fire managers, before they sink this restaurant  Best suggestion? Turn left at the front door and head to Bricktown Brewery for good food AND good service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita-falls,,,,,
2,Kat W.,"Burkburnett, TX",2,121,18.0,2.0,2017-03-12,"Had the cheese pretzels, veggie burger, and sweet potato fries. Never got a refill on the ""bottomless"" fries or drinks due to our waitress being MIA.  So while the food was good, it wasn't good enough to make up for the complete lack of service.

6,Ashely Y.,"Wichita Falls, TX",0,12,,3.0,2017-03-23,"Just as bad as every other Red Robin. I only go when I have discounts.

4,Timothy S.,"Wichita Falls, TX",0,2,,2.0,2017-06-20,Hamburgers were equivalent to Burger King. Definitely not worth the cost. Service was very slow. Had to ask for re-fills on drinks and bottomless fries.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita-falls,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88

We went at around 9pm, we weren't greeted by a hostess but the bartender came & sat us. Shortly after, the waitress, Lacey, came & got our drink orders. We quickly got our drinks, ordered an appetizer - boneless wings. They were fast & soo good! Then we ordered our burgers.
