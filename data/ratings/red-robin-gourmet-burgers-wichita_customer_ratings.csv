We have always had a good experience at other RR locations but not here.  It was about 4:30 on Saturday when we arrived. Food was decent but horrible service.  My husband only got about 5 fries with his meal and apparently they don't  do the bottomless fries here or drink refills because we were never offered either even with empty cups and a lonely burger on the plate by itself. The cherry on top... We were informed that they weren't giving out balloons and we got to listen to our young daughter cry on our trip home.  If you are in Wichita looking for a place to eat I would avoid RR, they have plenty of other restaurants that won't leave a bad taste in your mouth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita?start=40,3.204,3.204,3.204,3.204,3.204

However, I think it's ridiculous that they don't have physical gluten free menus and you have to go online to see it. Not everyone has a smartphone and employees have to get theirs out to show the customers. Also, there was no wifi so it required data usage to look at. The food and service were AMAZING and the staff was beyond helpful in answering questions and recommending favorites.

As a frequent diner of all different types of places I know the importance of the first impression. The first person you interact with at an establishment it really should be a happy one.  Once we were seated though we were served very quickly during extremely busy hours. Joey our waiter was stop on. Never missing a step drink were timed perfectly, he was attentive but did not hover. The perfect waiter in my opinion! I was very impressed. I ordered the Bonzi Burger with a garden burger and it was great. My only complaint was the soggy bun. By the time it got to my table it was already mush. The flavor was still there but that smash bread feeling is a little off putting. Mister had The chophouse burger which he also throughly enjoyed.

We kept seeing those 'Gourmet Burger' commercials and since my Husband had never been -- we decided to go here for lunch. We got there when they opened at 11:00 am. We ordered their 'Tower of Onion Rings' as an appetizer. my Husband got a Margarita 'on the rocks' and I got an T.N.T. (which is a long Island Iced Tea basically). Our Server, Bryce, brought a basket of fries when we first arrived and they were hot and delicious with 2 different dipping sauces. Then he brought our drinks along with the waters that I requested. My Husband made a funny face when he first sipped his Margarita. He said it tasted funny -- not like a typical Margarita. The Onion Rings were huge and delicious and they too came with 2 different dipping sauces. Hubby ordered the 'Prime Chophouse' burger and I ordered the 'Whiskey River BBQ' I asked to substitute the fries for a salad -- since we had already had fries and onion rings. It's becoming increasingly rare to find 1000 Island in restaurants, so I was pleased that they had it. The burgers were delicious and huge. We only ate about half and packed the rest up in 'To Go' boxes for dinner. Our lunch was a little pricey -- with Tip it was $55 dollars -- but we had gotten appetizers and drinks But even had we gotten sodas and no appetizer it would have been about $35. We enjoyed it though and would go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita?start=20,3.568,3.568,3.568,3.568,3.568

Instantly we were greeted by friendly staff and seated immediately. My friend and both looked at the drink menu, and we both decided to get a ""coco-rita"", which is essentially if a pina colada and a margarita had a baby. it was so delicious! I decided on a boca burger, over the gardenburger that they also offer and got it mushroom swiss style! The burger itself was good but the whole mushroom swiss aspect was lacking, it was pretty flavorless, the mushrooms could have used some seasoning. Also my sesame seed bun was soggy and felt apart.  My favorite part was the fries! They are thicker cut and I would describe them as steak fries seasoned to perfection. Although, the portion was very small and they were never refilled.

I did not want to make a scene and upset her or the baby so we waved down the server (if i made a big deal i know she would not have eaten at all) Ticks are very dangerous as they are dosease causing. I had a 10month old baby with us I was going to give some of the fruit. And my daughter being 9 didn't need a tick either. Luckily she saw it. They were very kind about it, gave her just apples. The server checked them all. Another guy possibly a manager came over to apologize and said he passed it along. He was very kind. About it.. So the kids meal didnt cost anything. Not sure if comped or kids eat free tuesday i never know what resteraunts do that. So if they comped it for that, it was nice of them. Anyways nice place. I am sure they tossed the fruit out.. hopefully. But the royal burger w egg was great, mini corn dogs goood.. bf had some spicy burger he loved. Our server was very nice.

3,Rachel B.,"Newton, KS",45,83,71.0,1.0,2017-10-03,"This red Robin has either gone seriously downhill, or it was having a terrible night when we went. My burger which I asked to have no pink whatsoever (I have a queasy issue with bloody meat) came way undercooked, really rare, and I took a bite before realizing. I became so I'll I ended up leaving without eating at all. My other half's burger was not good, undersea stoned and chintzy on toppings and our server was not only unhelpful, but rude and when we complained to the manager, not only didn't he really help, but he must have been vague with the server because the server came over and said, I'm sorry if I offended you. (I'm sorry if I offended you? What the.....?) Anyway, we used to love going there, but it's looking like we won't be returning any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita,3.68,3.68,3.68,,3.6800000000000006

13,Megan B.,"Bozeman, MT",0,2,,1.0,2017-10-29,"We will not be going back to Red Robin anytime soon. We decided to try it because they have gluten free buns and it is kid friendly. We got there and only one other family was waiting to be seated. No one greeted me. I asked if there was a wait for a table of four. The girl said ""no"" and then just stood there. I wasn't sure what to do. She didn't ask for my name or tell me to hang on a moment or anything. Then I saw her grab some menus and start walking. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to follow her because she still hadn't said anything. I was thinking maybe she was seating the other people who were there before me first. After she realized I wasn't following her she came back and said she could seat us. We got to the booth where we were supposed to sit and it was covered in food and dirty dishes so she said ""I need to clean this so just wait right here"". It was really busy and we were in everyone's way. Eventually we got seated and started asking questions about the menu. Either I wasn't being clear or she wasn't understanding me because she couldn't answer any of my questions.  We asked her to give us a minute to get our order together. She didn't come back for at least 10-15 minutes. Which, when you have kids, every minute counts. We all ordered something different and she said the sides that we ordered were all ""bottomless"". She brought out cold, mushy fries fairly quickly. My kids weren't even impressed. The food didn't take too long. But I can see why. It wasn't good at all.  They gave my son a bun with his burger when I ordered one without (allergy), then they put onion on my burger and I asked for it without and then they forgot my sons side of apples, and then they didn't give us any silverware or napkins. None of us wanted to eat much of our meal. It just wasn't good food. But we did eat the some of the sides (broccoli, apples etc) and never once did our waitress offer to refill our ""bottomless"" sides. We actually barely saw her. Finally towards the end of our meal a younger guy comes over and asks if he can refill our waters and then as he's walking away said ""oh, if you need anything I guess I'm taking care of you now. At least that's what my boss said"". I wasn't sure what to think. I was just glad our meal was almost done. A few minutes after that, our original waitress came over and said ""you must be confused right? Well, I'm not feeling well so I was going to go home but I'm going to stay until you guys are all done."". To which I replied, if you're not feeling well you should just go home. And she said, no, she will finish the job she started.  Alright, I will give her credit for wanting to hang in there, but she shouldn't be working in the food industry while feeling sick! Unfortunately I have a compromised immune system and it's a serious deal if I get certain illnesses. So when someone who is handling your food says that they're sick but will tough it out, I would rather not!! The whole experience was not good. Here's to hoping my family and I don't catch whatever out waitress was sick with.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004
2,Angie H.,"Wichita, KS",21,101,89.0,4.0,2017-11-05,"I love this place!  Aside from the ""eat yourself silly"" bottomless steak fries, we've always had great service here including free fries with ranch and campfire sauce to tide you over until your food arrives. I love their burgers but I always get a chicken burger now.  The chicken breasts are always big and juicy.  It's a staple lunch place for us when we have to venture out East for a Costco trip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004

1,Tram N.,"Bedford, TX",39,187,651.0,3.0,2017-12-30,Came here with my family for lunch.  Service was great and our food came out in a timely manner. At this location they bring out basket of fries to your table for you to snack on while you wait.  I ordered the wedge burger (basically a burger patty between two wedge salad). I asked for my patty to come out with some pink but mines was well done. Minus the meat being over cooked my burger was nice and light.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita,3.6,3.6,3.6,,3.6000000000000005
