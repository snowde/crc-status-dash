The special gingerbread milk shake ruled. It ruled hard. The walls made me a little queasy at times. It's like they put the past 50 years of pop culture into a blender and left the top off. Beatles, Seinfeld, Yankees, ehh...? Are all Red Robins like that? I can't remember. Anyway, it's a lot of flair to take in whilst digesting.

An almost empty resturaunt with more employees than patron. We are seated and all of the tables around us are empty and we are placed in this tiny table. This annoyed me but I digress, the waitress takes about 8 mins to get to us and asks us what we want to drink.  She returns and takes our orders. Two burgers and cheese sticks app. Thirty minutes later the manager arrives with the burgers and I ask him about the appetizer. He apologizes and the waiter forgot to put them in.  The hamburgers were delicious but the bottomless steakfries were laughable. I got about 8-9 in my basket and was never Asked if I wanted more. What annoyed me even more was the tiny table and lack of space for our meal.  So when the appetizer showed up the space problem was there.  If the manager had not caught and corrected the problem ( free appetizer) and apologized I would have given this one or two stars for slowness and lack of attention to detail.

6,Anthony R.,"Pittston, PA",2,66,16.0,1.0,2014-04-21,"I love Red Robin Burgers.  What do I love more than steak fries?  Unlimited steak fries!!! So why the 1 star rating?  The management oversight of this Red Robin is about as bad as you can find in a franchise.  The work ethic is damn-near Walmartesque.  I've been here about five times since they opened.  About 18 months ago, my family and I went to the restaurant.  We were seated.  25 minutes later we walked out.  From the moment our butts hit the seat, to the moment we walked out not one Red Robin employee took the time to even say hi, much less take an order.   I complained to Red Robin corporate and got a phone call from the manager.  He was polite, but at the end of the day we agreed that as a customer, it's not my job to beg someone to wait on me.  He offered to discount or pay for our next visit (I can't remember which).  I explained that I'll happily pay for my burger, they just need someone to wait on me. Fast forward to a month or two ago.  We went on a weeknight.  It's not exactly the ""busy"" time.  This time our waitress was quick to come to our table.  45-50 minutes after taking our order, one of the managers asked how our visit was going.  We basically said that for a Saturday night in a packed restaurant, knocking on the door of an hour wait is understood.  In the middle of the week, it's unacceptable.  This manager immediately gave us a gift card because she said that we were correct.  Keep in mind, our food didn't come out while the manager was talking with us.  There was still more time wait. Since I don't have hours to wait for burgers and fries, I gave the gift card to a friend.  He said that they were very attentive when he gave them the card.  But why should you have to do that?  I'm not looking for a free meal.  I just wish that this Red Robin was run like, well, ANY other Red Robin I've been to.  And I get that a good burger in Wilkes-Barre is about impossible to find (why, I have no idea), but take the drive to Dickson City and go to 5 Guys or Red Robin.  The drive to Dickson City is still shorter than the time wasted here. Update: July 2016. Five Guys added a store less than a mile from this Red Robin.  You'd be well-served to go there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilkes-barre?start=20,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18

Commented, ""It's cold in here."" Two women who were leaving affirmed our comment.  Asked Lori, the hostess, ""Is the whole restaurant this cold?"" Lori: a curt, ""No."" Then seated us under an air vent.  We spoke to the manager who said they had just adjusted the temp. Cold air continued to blow.  We ordered our (fast and yummy) dinner.  I walked to the bar area and felt the noticeable difference. We were moved. (Yay!!) BTW, I had a fleece jacket. My usually ever-warm husband had goose bumps.

36,Nicholas V.,"Hanahan, SC",64,119,,1.0,2015-07-26,"I love Red Robin, usually.  This location is simply disaster-piece theater. Ate there on a Saturday in the early afternoon.  After the hostess seated the bad of what looked like soccer hooligans, I waited at the hostess stand for a good 10 minutes before I was acknowledged.  Then, as the hostess was about to ask how many were in my party, she took a phone call and completely ignored me.  I guess I needed more tattoos or teenagers rolling their eyes in my party. The server who did take care of me gave me a menu and then came back 30 seconds later expecting me to know what to order.  I don't know, I'm not a Red Robin regular, maybe give me 5 minutes to look at the menu?  I already waited 10 minutes to get seated, what is another 5?  Ordered the salted caramel milkshake and the basic burger.  The milkshake was a bit uneven, salty on the top and caramel on the bottom, as if they missed the basic tenet of ""milk shake"".  The burger was competent. And seriously, what does someone have to do to get some napkins in this joint?  Should I wipe my hands on my shirt like many of the others in the place?  I know some folks in there were down with grease stains on their shirt, but not me.  Heck, the lady with bad David Bowie in Labyrinth tattoo was totally down with that along with liberally picking her nose.  Perhaps a napkin could have helped there?  I mean, you are right next to Dunder-Mifflin, maybe you could convince them to produce some napkins from their paper stock?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilkes-barre,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002

We were so disappointed and felt sick after eating at this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilkes-barre,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52

28,Medeliz R.,"Newark, NJ",0,14,8.0,5.0,2017-04-04,Had exceptional service from my waiter/bartender.  I think his name was Josh.  I'm on a business trip so I was dining alone.  From the moment I was sat by the bar area he was very attentive.  I ordered a Piña Colada to drink and it was delicious. My burger was cooked perfectly.  Definitely had a great experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilkes-barre,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
22,Bill B.,"Broomall, PA",10,314,186.0,3.0,2017-05-27,I have had better. I think five guys is way better in the burger dept but you can get a lot of different items at Red Robin.  Also the endless fries are more like barely get fries. I literally got 8 fries on my plate and waited 20 minutes for a handful of cold fries.    My wife liked the sweet potato fries.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilkes-barre,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84

29,Greg K.,"Utica, NY",9,6,1.0,4.0,2017-07-11,"Really hard to go wrong with a Red Robin burger! For a chain it is consistently one of the best burgers I've had.  Beer-wise, the waitress didn't know the styles of the local brews on tap and brought me an unappealing summer wheat--had to return it. No less, love this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilkes-barre,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
25,Matt S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,65,1.0,1.0,2017-10-12,Slllllllllooooooooooowwwwwwwww service.   Don't bother wasting your time and sitting in the bar area. They have one girl working the bar and all the tables. But they have four people standing and twiddling their thongs at the front entrance. PS don't try to call for a pick up the phone rings and rings and rings. When you try to get another order of fries it takes forever.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilkes-barre,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

21,Vanessa L.,"Central, PA",29,142,22.0,1.0,2017-11-11,"There's two kinds of plant based burgers at Red Robin. I dined at the Hamburg location and was delighted to see a vegan offering thatg was non Boca and was actually yummy that it nearly renewed my faith in Red Robin... Keyword: Nearly. At least at this location. At this location, it's just the Boca Burger which arrived a little undercooked and accidentally vegetarian.  I didn't bother to ask for correction because the service is very bored and inconsistent here.  Just save yourself a nice outing and go to a different RR or somewhere else, please.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilkes-barre,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

20,Ann K.,"Syracuse, NY",38,557,1.0,3.0,2017-12-29,"Stopped at Red Robin while travelling for Christmas.  We got there around 11:30am and had our food within minutes.  My mushroom burger was excellent, only complaint was I got a very small amount of not very warm fries.  I was about half done with my burger when the waitress offered more fries that were both hotter and more plentiful than on my original order so I have to think they were perhaps almost out when I received my burger.  My husband's burger was also good and his serving of garlic fries was also quite good.
