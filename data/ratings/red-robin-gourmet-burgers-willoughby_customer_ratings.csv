It's not so good on the calories but who cares when you want to indulge on a good juicy burger. The only annoying thing is the ""happy Birthday"" cheers which gets very loud.

35,Murray R.,"Cleveland, OH",120,419,43.0,1.0,2012-03-05,"Overpriced, overadvertised, overcooked and for me, just plain over. Red Rubber is the Chi Chi's of burgers. Secretaries going there for happy hour probably think it's the shit. I however, just think it's shit. I had the bleu cheese burger. It bleu. The fried onion strings they put in it were tough. I felt like I was flossing as I ate. The cheese was, as Stef said, undetectable. The wait, almost impossibly long.  On a Wednesday night. The one perk of working Saturdays off and making Weds my going out night is the small crowds and tiny wait for service. Not here. They're too busy rocking out to Seger to try and provide expedient service.  The decor? Imagine a party store threw up in Uncle Sam's mouth and he passed out in a birdhouse full of Johnny Rocket's old furniture. Just plain obnoxious. This place was tailor made for Santorum voters. Low brow, not Lowenbrau, and low quality. F your bird mascot.

Our waiter was fantastic, I wish I could remember his name but I do remember his nametag said he was a trainer. I ordered a side of Mac and cheese for my 10 month old to eat and our waiter brought it out with our appetizer knowing that it is difficult to keep an infant preoccupied. He was quick with re-fills and very friendly. My mother in law and I had salads and they were very fresh, the kids had kids meals and they were what to be expected.

My friends and I got together for a quick dinner. The menu had changed since I had last been there, but the same items I remember were on there, just in a different menu format. They also had new dipping sauces, which I was not impressed with. The service during my meal here this time was not good. It took 3 times asking to get water.

Well, we've been back several times but imagine our surprise when we returned a few days ago and found it was completely renovated.  It is beautiful and beautifully decorated.  The silly bird and the pictures are gone which is fine with me.  Much more upscale but the same wonderful service and food and still very child friendly.  We'll be back next week when our grandchildren come to visit - they will love it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-willoughby?start=20,2.7079999999999997,2.7079999999999997,2.7079999999999997,2.7079999999999997,2.7079999999999997
50,Cherie I.,"Beech Mountain, NC",0,15,,1.0,2014-12-09,"This place is BEYOND awful. I started with the pretzel bites. They were deep fried and nasty. They tasted like the breading on a corn dog and they came with this nasty beer cheese sauce. For my meal I ordered the CA Chicken Sandwich. The bun was wet and soggy - nasty! The chicken was tasteless. Supposedly all-you-can-eat, or as Red Robin calls them ""Bottomless fries"" were supposed to come with my sandwich. When the sandwich arrived I received only  EIGHT THIN, SMALL, DRY and TASTELESS  steak fries. That's right - only EIGHT little fries. This is the biggest scam this restaurant is running. They know that most ppl will not keep asking for the fries, and the waitress never came back until we were just about ready to leave, so I was only able to get the fries refilled ONCE and when they arrived I receive only EIGHT more thin, small and DRY steak fries. What a joke! This is SO DECEPTIVE of this restaurant it is unreal. At ANY OTHER RESTAURANT you would get more fries with only ONE order. What a joke. My husband ordered mexican chicken breasts. Instead of the salad that came with it he opted for the chicken tortilla soup- which cost $1.50 more btw. The size of the ""cup of soup"" was an absolute joke. It was so small it was unreal. The chicken was also thin and nasty. Overall, I would give this place an F. I am astonished that people are giving this place good reviews - absolutely astonished. The only people that would give this place a good review are ppl who think Wal-Mart food and Mcdonalds are good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-willoughby?start=40,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18

14,Dan K.,"Eastlake, OH",1,9,,2.0,2015-08-01,"I was sooo disappointed with my experience at Red Robin.  The expectation I had of Red Robin was a decent place to enjoy a good meaty burger, at a reasonable price.  I visited Red Robin yesterday, everything was changed.  I did enjoy the change in scenery, however the menu changes were terrible.  All the prices went up, and the burgers were made smaller.  My expectations turned to ""I could easily do better on my grill.""  I took a bite of my burger and I was wondering where the meat is.  Also, my poor waiter...  he was overbooked.  I'm not sure what happened, but the poor guy was running all over the place...  suffice to say service was slow. Things I think you can do to improve.  If your going to be a good burger place as a customer want a custom blend of burger meat.  Something other than what the deliver truck drops off at every other burger place in the city.  If you put the work ""Brew"" in the title of your restaurant, carry more micro brews in your bar, maybe even some that are not at every other bar within a mile from you.  Granted Great Lakes Dortmunder is an awesome beer...  the problem is I don't have to go to Red Robin to find it...  every bar carries it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-willoughby,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004

However, it's the food that keeps a restaurant in my good graces, and Red Robin just keeps falling short of the mark. The fries may be bottomless, but the portion so small and so covered in Red Robin seasoning that adds nothing. The burgers, which they pride themselves on are, to me, really kind of bland. The bacon on any burger lacks flavor. On my last visit I had a grilled chicken sandwich. It was as rubbery and tasteless a piece of poultry as I've ever had. I sent it back. They delivered another sandwich quickly. It was better but still below average. Rubbery chicken (not overcooked) means one of a couple things. 1) Poor quality chicken to begin with. 2) Chicken that was frozen, thawed, then frozen again, 3) microwaved until near done and then put on a grill just to make a few grill marks. Whatever the case was, it was a bad meal and has soured me on the place.  Good service and a very contrite and polite manager can't save bad food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-willoughby?start=20,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004

If you like blue cheese this is the burger for you. Its on a toasted ciabatta bun so this helps make sure the bun doesn't get soggy.

We asked several times for crayons bc the baby was antsy with the kids menu in front of him...and used to coloring to pass the time. Had to go ask the Manager to finally get any crayons! Looked at the menu &I  asked about the mayo in the picture on the Southern Charm burger (which is NOT on the description on the menu at all! They have since corrected it online but menu does NOT have mayo on the menu in restaurant!)so I ordered my burger minus mayo-waiter said ""it isn't mayo, its aoli""....I said ""aoli is made with mayo & I don't eat it at all, so no mayo or aoli, whatever it is please!""   We received our food,my burger was slathered with the mayo/aoli! Had to send it back of course. My Whole family got their food & ate all theirs,yet still no replacement food. Manager came over & asked if I wanted MORE fries...I said ""I never got ANY fries at all, they took my plate back"". Still waited & waited. Asked to just cancel my meal so we can leave. The manager apologized & said I should have asked for no mayo.....I DID. No may, no aoli, whatever it was, I covered my bases! She then offered to make the meal on the house & pack it so I can take it w me,hesitated, but said ok.  Well opened it a couple hrs later....frankly I wasn't jazzed about eating anything coming from there at this point.  Well apparently even the ""free take home meal"" burger was even more incorrect as the first time! I Got a burger patty, cheese, lettuce, a piece of bacon on a ciabatta bun. No carmelized onions, no bbq sauce, no brown sugar glaze, no tomato I added....all I wanted was the no mayo/aoli that is NOT even listed on the menu, but I saw & inquired about bc its in the picture. I was given a dry bacon cheeseburger w lettuce. Why would I pay $13.99 for a bacon cheeseburger & not just get a reg ole burger?!  Well- Every single time we come...my order is messed up! I don't eat condiments, so it shouldn't be this frickin difficult to request 1 item to be left off!!!  No longer coming here...even for the free birthday burger-it will be messed up garanteed!

17,Justin F.,"Jordan Drive, Willoughby, OH",0,2,,1.0,2016-05-24,"Absolute trash customer service. Called to get a to-go order. Person picked up and then hung up on me. Called back, person picked up, put me on hold and never came back to the phone. I've been here a few other times and had similar service. I wouldn't bother if someone hadn't purchased gift cards for me. Decent enough food. Terrible service. Hard pass.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-willoughby,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76

It can get a bit pricey, that's why I give it 4 stars, but overall it is a great place.

0,Alex R.,"Willoughby, OH",4,18,6.0,4.0,2016-11-25,"When you walk in there's usually somebody waiting to seat you.  Sometimes have to wait a minute or two if it's not very busy. Not a big deal. Since they've redesigned the interior it looks absolutely amazing in there! I actually enjoy sitting in there now, it doesn't look like a Crayola crayon drawing of a Chuck E. Cheese's restaurant.  The manager there Dom, is a great guy he will take care of you handover fist! He gets the job done no matter what it costs. The servers and waitresses are usually awesome! I think I've had one bad experience out of the entire time I've been there and I've been going there for about 10 to 12 years or so.  The food is also extremely good. A little bit more pricey than I would like, but I'm not complaining because you get a large amount of food when you order it. The milkshakes dog, mmmmm dem milkshakes that'll give you the quakes. Fries that'll cross your eyes. Burgers, well they just have burgers.  Really though, the burgers are absolutely phenomenal!!  POWOWOWOWOWOWOWOW it's that good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-willoughby,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
16,Tara S.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,13,,2.0,2017-01-22,"I was disappointed in my visit to Red Robin. For starters, I ordered a side salad with my meal that came out on a plate with my sandwich. I always thought salads came out before the meal and on a separate plate, but maybe I'm wrong. The salad included dry Iceberg lettuce that tasted like it had been sitting out, not to mention the portion wasn't even big enough to call it a side salad. It also came out without dressing on it. Secondly, my sandwich was falsely advertised as having avocado on it when it ended being only 1 small slice. Thirdly, the bottomless fries were not bottomless. The server checked on us about 15 min after we got our food, and when we were finally able to order more fries he said it would be 5 more minutes. I also received zero refills on my water, and the server left our plates sitting there well after we were finished eating. I'm only giving this 2 stars because our server was at least friendly. The food and service this go around have steered me away from Red Robin for a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-willoughby,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

Food is over priced , for example a 14.99 chicken sandwich or an  8.99 thick burger. Only redeeming quality is bottomless fries , also drinks as in beer cost as much as a six pack for one drink.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-willoughby,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
7,Robin R.,"Cleveland, OH",1,55,,3.0,2017-04-26,We went here for my Free Birthday burger with fries and we sat in the bar area.  The whiskey BBq burger and the onion straws were long and stringy and disappointing.  we were happy we could get garlic Aoili sauce with fries though at extra cost and 1 should have been Free with fries.  The burgers are smaller than they used to be,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-willoughby,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
13,Nyesha M.,"Cleveland, OH",30,3,,1.0,2017-07-25,"I took my family of 7 to the Red Robin in Willoughby, Ohio. They were running a promotion and ""Offer begins 7/20/17 and ends 7/30/17. Valid at participating locations. Dine in restaurant and receive 50% off a Fire-Grilled Gourmet Burger with purchase of an additional Gourmet, Finest or Big Tavern Burger; entrée; entrée salad or sandwich."" I was told I could only get the gourmet burger. I disagreed and showed the email to my server. She said ok and went away. Moments later her manager, Dominic, comes to the table and aggressively tells me that my email is wrong. I try to show it to him, but he refused to look or be corrected.  He walked away while I was trying to explain to him. He turned around and came back stating he would not argue with me. I was confused, like how did this all happen. I became so upset with him that I asked for his managers name. I go to the restroom and come back to the table and there is a check on the table. I HAD NOT BEEN SERVED ANY FOOD!. We were so frustrated we decided to leave and when I asked his name he accused me of walking out on my bill.

They were busy so I thought I'd let it slide until a family was seated right next to us and had their drink order taken right away. Talked to a manager who tried (and failed) to get us to sit back down. He apologized but didn't seem too intent on really getting us to stay, so we left. Kind of glad we did anyway because they are ridiculously overpriced. Will never go there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-willoughby,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
