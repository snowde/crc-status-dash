(huh?!?) But I am actually thankful for their crappy atmosphere...keeps me away from the place so I can avoid destroying my diet!

I was told that the fries were ""bottomless"" and I could refill them, but I was full after one serving. I'm surprised that they are allowed to use the term bottomless in a restaurant with children.  THE BATHROOMS: The men's room had 2 sinks, 2 stalls and a urinal. They were clean, which surprised me because of all the rambunctious kids running around the place.

25,Skylar F.,"Wilmington, NC",95,15,1.0,1.0,2017-08-15,"Definitely not the best experience I have had at a restaurant. The waitress forgot 3 things out of our order And clearly was not that interested in trying to address them when we asked about it. The food was ok but I'd take 5 guys burgers over this any day! I read all the reviews before going here with the family and just thought people were being dramatic. No, all the reviews were spot on. Not going here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilmington,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
29,Douglas F.,"Greer, SC",0,5,,3.0,2017-09-08,Food was good but for a $13.00 burger I  felt like just putting all the menus for a table of 8 in a stack for is to pass out and a tray with napkins forks and knifes for us to pass out wasn't good customer service. The waitress did a great job.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilmington,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
24,Kimberlyn C.,"St James Village, Wilmington, NC",42,3,,1.0,2017-09-08,You have good food and service but I work in Mayfair and we give discounts to everyone that works there and I was denied mine.  Sadly I still have to give it to y'all but I can find a new burger joint,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilmington,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
32,Elizabeth B.,"Wilmington, NC",0,1,,1.0,2017-09-09,"Service was slow- took almost 30 mins to get 2 burgers and 1 chicken sandwich with a mac and cheese.  Pub size mac and cheese is not much more than kids size- for $7.99.  Ordered a salad with it that didn't come until we were all finished with our meals.  Never got a refill of my water.   Fries were lukewarm with the entrees and when we asked for another ""free"" order they were even worse.   Chicken sandwich was a small portion of chicken- didn't even come close to the size of the bun.  It had been years since we went there because of poor service in the past but we decided we would try again.   Too many better choices around to make that decision again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilmington,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

23,Wes J.,"Savannah, GA",0,9,,2.0,2017-10-19,I love Red Robins being stationed on the west coast bit this place is horrible.  The servers all ate lunch at the same time. Granted they are nice people. Just bad service.  I can live with the bad service but there are nats everywhere.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilmington,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
20,John C.,"Wilmington, NC",49,13,6.0,3.0,2017-11-11,"So me and my girlfriend came here for the veterans day dine in. The hosts said it was a 5 min wait for two and as that there was plenty seats for a two party. I asked to sit at the bar instead. The conditions were not clean and I had to wipe my own area along with my girlfriend's. Third the food. We both had the tavern double. The buns fell apart, not so fresh. At least the fries and blue moon were good. For the first time I'm disappointed because I always come here. Last and not to sound like a bratt but no thank you for your service or anything displayed that its an actual day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilmington,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
