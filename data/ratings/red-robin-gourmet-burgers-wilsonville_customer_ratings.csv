After putting the menu on the table, the words from the hostess was, your server will be right with you. Right now red robin is serving the red tavern burger for 6.99. For that price, it comes with unlimited steak fries. The burger itself is a double patty burger with tomato, lettuce, cheese and onion. For $1, you can upgrade it to the different types of burger that is listed, such as a jalepeno burger, buffalo burger or even a ghost pepper burger!!!   Our server was very polite and nice. However she had a hearing aide, so the way she spoke was kind of strange. Seeing someone with a 'disability' hired at red robin, I think that was nice. The food came in  a timely manner. She did check up on us, which was nice. -Just a thought- -The bar area is really small here, I wouldnt think this would be an ideal happy hour -place. - This location is kind of new, but some of the flat screens were kind of fuzzy. - This place has an arcade corner, that needs to be bigger.

I was actually highly impressed with the food. It seems Red Robin has stepped up their game a skosh. The menus were impressive and the presentation of the food was even better. The fries came in these little tin holders and the burgers were neatly wrapped and stayed that way. Our burgers were great, onion rings were on point and the endless steak fries were, well...endless.  My soda was continuously refilled, in fact, I never even noticed when it was refiled and back in front of me because I was too busy stuffing my face and visiting with my family.  My only complaint was that we were sat by the door and it was freezing! Every time someone came in or left, the breeze would hit us and we ended up having to keep our jackets on. This was not a negative thing, per say, just kind of an annoyance.  Overall, I would definitely go back.

In the past, we've also had to wait unreasonably long times to have our order taken, to get our food, and to get our check to pay.  Once we had to stand at our table for more than 5 minutes waiting for the host to come with the highchair, and eventually we just went and hunted one down ourselves.  Just atrocious.  If you want the yummy food that Red Robin serves, definitely take the time to drive to one of their alternate locations.  We've consistently had good service at the Washington Square location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilsonville?start=40,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.3120000000000003,3.4000000000000004

Who is running this crap show?  Just sitting back and watching the chaos, trying not to get upset but this will be out last trip to this location and maybe Red Robin.  Want to add that the remodel is going the wrong direction, they got rid of kids games and arcades to put a messy chalk wall.

17,Jeffrey R.,"Molalla, OR",15,89,3.0,3.0,2015-01-11,"After many satisfying visits to this Red Robin location, I had an experience that seems to closely match other recent visits by other yelpers. I still hold high regard for the chain in general, but today's execution really left a lot to be desired. If this had been my only visit, I would have put it at two stars -- but I'm not ready to write them off yet. My wife, son, and daughter accompanied me on this visit, and we requested one children's menu at the hostess station. After getting situated, my daughter informed me she had a menu, but no crayons or paper place-mat (aka entertainment) -- no big deal, but it took a little while to make it to the table. Drink and main dish ordering was uneventful. And then we waited... and waited... and waited. Our server finally stopped by, saw we had no food yet, and said he would go check on it... When our food finally arrived, everyone's dishes were fine except for mine -- I had ordered a Red's Big Tavern, Fiery Ghost Style, with a side salad; and they brought out what looked like a kid's cheeseburger. The waiter left the salad and took the burger back -- at which point I realized that our table had no silverware, which meant I had no way to eat the salad. The waiter came back and said they were firing a new burger for me, and that he would bring silverware -- he claimed the burger just had the wrong cheese on it, but I know it was a complete screw up somewhere along the line. Finally my burger came out, and our server disappeared. My son downed all of his fries and wanted more, but the server was nowhere to be found. I drained my iced tea, thanks to some especially spicy jalapenos; but no waiter around to refill. My wife's water ran dry. The long wait made for an even longer experience because we then had to wait for everything to be refilled. The food was good, overall; but all of the other miscues really detracted from the experience. Any one mistake as a stand-alone would not be a big deal, but all of them together in one visit made for a very amateurish execution. We will be back, but I really hope they figure out how to step up their game between now and then.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilsonville,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.54,2.88

The waitress was upbeat and pleasant, though not entirely accurate or attentive, but was nice enough to warrant a star for herself. When we asked for the manager to discuss the unacceptable performance from the kitchen, the manager was righteous, moderately indignant, and actually had the audacity to tell us we were mistaken about how long we had been waiting. Apparently, customer service training excludes management in the Red Robin Corporation.  Order taken at 7:30pm, hamburgers delivered at 9:00pm. 2 of the orders wrong. Aside from the inaccuracy, where I come from, that's 90 minutes. There was no apology, only a smug ""Well, the kitchen was backed up.""  There were only a few tables in the restaurant occupied! As we were leaving, they offered us a free slice of mud pie. We didn't accept because by then, all we wanted was to fly out of Red Robin. 2 burgers got sent back to the kitchen because they weren't remotely the correct order, and it was 15 minutes to get the right burger. In my humble opinion, they should have been free. All the respect in the world to mud pie we didn't want.  Listen, I can accept mistakes or the fact that Ernesto walked out on his job in the kitchen.

The poor service started quickly and was constant throughout. Wanted to sit in the lounge section so I can keep my eye on my vehicle so the lady at the front said only for 21 and over. I don't look 15 and neither does my lady but we weren't planning on getting drinks so no big deal we went and sat. Immediately were interrogated for our ID's. My lady left hers in the vehicle, so she had to go out and grabs hers and I show the bartender mine. He walks away. Before my lady returned he came order to get my drink order. I said I'd wait for her to return first. Then we ordered onion ring appetizers which were super greasy and there were no napkins at the table. I walked to the bus station and grabbed some and no one made an effort to apologize or take notice. Then we ordered the food. It arrived quickly but we had no silver ware or napkins and had to ask for them. I ordered my burger without tomatoes and a side of bbq sauce. I didn't receive my side and the burger had tomatoes on it. Okay food, but don't come here expecting good service. Likely will never head to a red robins again, and if I do it'll be because I was given a gift card, or I just may sell it to someone for half the value.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilsonville?start=40,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.184,2.64

Told the waiter about it and he asked if we could see anything different and I said ""no"".  Apparently since I didn't know exactly what was wrong with the burger we were not deserving of an alternative to make up for it.  So, since I wasn't full I just ate some more frys and still left feeling hungry and unsatisfied... I understand in the service industry sometimes people try to get away with things or get freebies.  Problem for us was, pretty much the whole turkey burger was uneaten (minus 2 bites). So he (the waiter) could clearly see we weren't going to eat the burger, so it wasn't like we were trying to get some extra food or a handout.   So he left us paying for an $11 burger that we didn't even eat.  There was no offer of something else or even a do-over.  He didn't bother to try an get it taken off our bill, just left us to pay for an uneaten burger and sent us on our way.  I brought it up to him hoping he might try to help us out in some form or another, but he basically shrugged it off and moved on.   Truly some of the worst service I've ever received.  Me and my wife both decided we were never going back.  It's not a cheap place and I'm not a fan of paying exuberant prices if I'm left to pay the tab when given garbage food.  And it wasn't so much the food as much as the lack of help when it was clear the food was not to our liking.  Just very poor service if anything goes wrong, so just a heads up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilsonville,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.084,2.48

I say yes, and instead of asking me if I would like a drink meanwhile, she starts walking away. I tell her I would like to order a root beer meanwhile I'm waiting for my friend and she says okay and walks off. Comes back 5 minutes later with the drink and walks off again.  My friend arrives 15 minutes later and a different waitress comes up and asks if we're ready to order as we were about to send off our order using the machine. We ask her to give us a few minutes to decide and so she leaves. 20 minutes later, a different waitress comes by and asks if we're ready, so say yes and we give her our order. I order my bacon cheeseburger with no tomatoes and with cheddar cheese, and instead of the regular bottomless fries, if I can get the herb fries instead. She says yes and my friend orders his with an extra serving of fries. She takes our order and leaves. 10 minutes more pass and our onion rings come out. We're sitting and chatting and playing on the machine while we wait, and another different waitress ( this is 4 now) comes and delivers our food. The burgers were correct but they gave me regular fries. They neglected to give my friend his extra serving of fries. The fries they DO give us however, are half assed barely filled containers. We shrug it off because it's bottomless anyways. So we didn't worry.  We're chit chatting, eating and finishing up drinks, and one waitress comes by to collect my friend's empty glasses, and leaves mine. She clearly saw it because it was RIGHT next to my friends. She asks if he found everything okay, totally ignoring me. At this point, I'm either thinking she's being rude to me for no reason, or it's probably because she doesn't think being friendly to me is worth anything. I resolve to give her a minimum tip.  We continue talking and playing games, and not once has any of those waitresses asked if we'd like a refill on our fries. Not even once. They don't come back after collecting the cups, so we decide to order our dessert using the machine. They deliver it, collects our plates and say nothing. We don't see them afterwards.

12,Brian C.,"Wilsonville, OR",0,7,,3.0,2017-03-17,"I've had mixed success here. A lot depends on the waiters/waitresses I guess. I go here about once a month or so, and most of the time staff is courteous and helpful and the food is good. The last two times we went there it seemed, we had some attitude from the waiters. This can make or break a dining experience in my opinion. My wife has an allergic reaction to gluten, for her its not a preference as much as a need. We ordered gluten free for her, and they made a regular hamburger with regular fries. We asked him to correct her order, and he insisted it should be fine to keep the innards and just throw it on a new Gluten free bun. It was still contaminated, and looked really messy when he finished. He was kind of grumpy about it so we just ate anyway. Furthermore, the fries were not gluten free, and he didn't want to fix that either (while all fries are potato, gluten free fries are made in a separate part of the kitchen to avoid contamination). The next time we went, we came for desert, and ordered a giant mud pie to split. The waiter gave us grief for not ordering a full meal. He tried to pass it off as a joke when we looked a bit upset, but mentioned it later when it came time to pay (sarcastically saying, ""who's going to splurge for the bill?""). I've never felt so humiliated in a restaurant! We weren't trying to be cheap, we just didn't need more food.
