54,Anna-Marie W.,"Orlando, FL",213,301,800.0,4.0,2012-11-20,"The first Red Robin restaurant opened in Seattle in the 1940's as a tavern known as Sam's, started by a local Barbershop Quartet singer.  Named after a song overheard by the owner on the jukebox, Red Robin soon became a hit for the local University of Washington students and slowly began to expand. Today, Red Robin has over 450 locations and is now based out of Denver, Colorado.  Though they are mainly known for their delicious burgers, the menu appeals to a wider audience, including sandwiches, soups and salads.  The burger scene is about to be turned upside down as Red Robin moves into the Orlando area. I recently had the chance to eat at Red Robin.  First of all, the menu is filled with a wide variety of burgers.  Though there are burgers you can order as is from a simple lettuce and tomato version to a spicy jalapeno burger that will set your mouth on fire, every burger can be customized to tailor to your needs.  In our case, my dinner companion Chad chose to substitute the regular all beef patty for the veggie option.  Red Robin offers a veggie burger, a vegan soy burger, a turkey burger and the most popular beef patty.  Or, if a burger just isn't your thing at all, you can substitute fish, grilled chicken, blackened chicken or a crispy chicken patty. My dinner date opted for the veggie burger slipped into the Burning Love burger and it was a spicy lover's dream.  Crispy fried jalapeno slices, a spicy salsa and pepperjack cheese on a jalapeno-cornmeal Kaiser roll.  Well, in addition to substituting the burger patty, Chad switched the pepperjack for blue cheese and a whole grain bun instead of the jalapeno Kaiser roll.  And it was still spicy.  And it was delicious.  It was mouthwatering. Speaking of mouthwatering, I had the Prime Chophouse burger.  They had me at horseradish sautéed mushrooms.  Add provolone cheese and crispy onion straws and you had me at hello.  I went for the beef patty version.  It was cooked perfectly (I ordered it medium), it was juicy, I got a taste of those horseradish mushrooms with every bite. My only complaint is that it was HUGE!!!  The burger patty is 6oz. which for me is enormous, however you can request a smaller patty (which will also lower the price by $2).  Everything can be customized- from the bun to the cheese to the sauces to the toppings to the burger patty itself.  Add a side of their ""bottomless"" fries and you are set.  Chad took advantage of the bottomless fries- his second serving of fries was bigger than the first.  They do not skimp. All Red Robin locations also have a full bar with a wide selection of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.  Next time I am getting the Salted Caramel Milkshake- somehow I missed that on the menu the first time around (I was just too busy building my dream burger). I now have my Red Robin bucket list.  We signed up for the Red Royalty card- they have some very serious generous offers.  Visit 5 times in the next 5 weeks and get $20 off our meal.  Every 10th entrée is free.  Free burger on your birthday (those are always my favorite loyalty perks). So brace yourselves Orlando, we go live on November 19th in Winter Garden on Daniels Road next to Fowler's Village.  Oh, bucket list....what will you bring me next??",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-winter-garden?start=60,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.1200000000000006
53,Melissa K.,"Windermere, FL",153,296,54.0,4.0,2012-11-20,"As the closest Red Robin was well over a hour away, it always baffled me why the local TV and radio stations aired their commercials.  While I could sing their catchy jingle to you (Red Robin - yummmmm), I really knew nothing about them until I saw the coming soon sign on the old Urban Flats establishment.  I have not had much luck with brand new restaurants recently, but when the opportunity for a free training meal presented itself, how can I say no to ""free?""   Our server, Samantha, was very friendly and helpful with menu recommendations - and based off of her enthusiasm, I was persuaded to try something a little bit out of my comfort zone, the Bonzai Burger.  When it comes to burgers, I'm usually a 'plain cheese' kind of girl - which is odd, considering my love of ethnic foods and eccentric flavors.  The Bonzai burger was topped with pineapple, cheese, and mayo, and it was very tasty.  If I go back again, I may try something more traditional, and I've heard good things about the Royal Robin (topped with a fried egg), but I was pleased with my choice.   The sweet potato fries were delicious - crispy on the outside, just right on the inside!  Our meal came with a milkshake, which was split among our table.  It was a creamy consistency, and pretty good (though not my usual flavor of choice).  As it is just around the corner from where I live, and reasonably priced with tasty food, I know we'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-winter-garden?start=60,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.0560000000000005
50,Mimi G.,"Brentwood, CA",218,270,1638.0,3.0,2012-11-23,"After years of seeing their commercials (even though there were none in our area) I was really curious to finally be able to try this place. The Good: I ordered a salted carmel shake (the small size) and a Prime Chophouse burger. My burger had horseradish sautéed mushrooms, gourmet steak sauce, provolone cheese with crispy onion straws and it's served on an onion bun with a dijon sauce. This was a very tasty burger and it was BIG (I took half of it home) with a nice char broiled flavor but it was very messy. Fixings were totally falling out all over the place. We each went through about four napkins. The small shake was a perfect size to satisfy without leaving me feeling like I needed to move one notch over on my belt. Marty tried a holiday special Gingerbread shake that he loved and a Tropical Sunburn burger that had jalapeños, grilled pineapple and a mango slaw. I liked his burger even more than mine and mine was good. You have the option to choose from a variety of bun styles including but not limited to whole wheat, gluten free or even bread free (lettuce). They serve Coke products and use Heinz 57 ketchup. The fries are plank style which is not my personal preference but they were fine, not the great potato flavor of a freshly hand cut variety but certainly passable.They offer ""bottomless"" fries here which is not what you will be if you eat a giant burger, a shake and extra fries. Butt (pun intended) if you want more - you can have them. The Bad: It is a wide open restaurant with a high industrial ceiling, which means it's really loud in there and not easy to carry on conversations. The menu is slightly confusing. When Marty ordered his burger, our server asked him if he wanted the double or the regular. Marty opted for the regular, figuring that it would be smaller, since something that is ""double"" is ... well...twice as much. WRONG. Here the tavern double is a smaller amount of meat and costs $2 less than the regular. It wasn't until we got our bill and Marty saw that it was more than expected that he questioned our server and was told that by choosing the regular burger he had gotten the larger, more expensive one. See what I mean - confusing! To his credit (or ours actually) our server apologized for not making the distinction clearer and reduced the check by $2. The Ugly: This location shares it's lot with The Cracker Barrel, Starbucks, Cold Stone Creamery among a few other places and it is not large enough for the volume of traffic. Trying to find an open parking spot  was insane. Marty drove around for nearly 10 minutes before one opened up. All in all it was a very good burger, good but not mind blowing fries, a very nice shake, confusing sizes of burgers, too loud for my taste and horrible parking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-winter-garden?start=60,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004

I have been waiting as I am sure many others have been waiting for this location. Needless to say we were there on opening day! YES YES YES!!!! One major problem. The parking is horrible, they are nestled in a strip plaza next to Cracker Barrel and Cold stone creamery, so finding s parking is not an easy task. But once you do and you get to experience the best burgers in the universe! With a bottomless root beer float and endless fries (get them garlic style) YUM!!!! Our service was great and the food was perfect. My only quandary is I like my burger medium rare to medium and they only cook it a little pink or no pink, so ask them to cook it your way if you want it less done. A manager stopped by our table and I inquired when the next one in Orlando will be and he said on IDrive at the old Mercado where the Orlando Eye and Orlando Live is being built.

58,Ashley E.,"Orlando, FL",301,182,888.0,2.0,2012-12-04,"Meh, meh, MEH! So not impressed with this after my initial visit. Particularly given the years-and-years of television spots being aired when there wasn't even a restaurant in our market. Well, now there is!  I paid a visit with some friends this past weekend, and while I completely understand it's a new establishment that's EXTREMELY busy and likely trying to work out some kinks, there's going to have be a ton of improvement prior to my returning. Let's start with the food. Not good. At all. Well, the fries kinda rock (and apparently they're never-ending). But it stops there...at least for me. Firstly, I ordered a BBQ burger (yes, I was being ""bad"" during this experience), and originally asked for no tomatoes or mayo to be included. Gross! And when it was delivered to me both were slathered on the buns. No big deal - the server took it back and brought a new one within about 10 minutes. Entertaining, though, given I'm always the slowest one eating at the table. And when the ""right"" item was served to me, it really wasn't so great. Another individual in my party had their burger messed up as well. In the end, both burgers were removed from our bills, which is certainly what the manager and the restaurant should've done, and actually is probably what will encourage me to go back and give this place another shot. I think I'll wait a few months until they figure out their rhythm....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-winter-garden?start=60,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007
120,Jamie H.,"Newnan, GA",8,63,16.0,2.0,2012-12-06,"My husband is from Colorado, so I couldn't wait to try the new red Robin on Daniels Road. We went there on a date night. That was a big mistake. We waited about half an hour before we sat down, then it took about 25 minutes for our food to get there. When it got there our order was wrong. I don't think it was the server's fault, and she was absolutely awesome.... But the kitchen staff really needs to step it up. The following Tuesday was something called ""Jim Day"". I happen to fall into the category of getting a free ""Jim burger"", so I went in three days later. I was hoping I would have a better experience. I went there with my kids. I was not impressed, and they still got my order wrong, as well as my husbands. Again, our server was great, so hats off to these people who constantly have to deal with these kinks. The manager did stop by to see how things were and we spoke of the wait and she did apologize. We are pretty forgiving, especially for a new restaurant, but we shall see how soon we go back. My burger was tiny! There was little meat to constitute a $7.99 burger. It was good, but nothing to write home about.

We both had the prime chophouse burger it was very big, very juicy, and very flavorful. We had gone early to avoid any crowds (4:30 pm) and to get a parking. Service was fast and friendly (Grayson) and the manager dropped by to welcome us. The decor was bright and lively but I could tell even at an early hour the sound volume would be bothersome at peak times. I am always hesitant to pay for gourmet hamburgers since there are fast food places that do decent burgers but in this case the extra money is justified.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-winter-garden?start=140,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004
55,Christopher O.,"Winter Garden, FL",384,337,461.0,4.0,2012-12-15,"I have been watching Red Robin commercials for months now totally knowing that the nearest one is about 70 miles east of Orlando... but not any more!  They opened one up about 2 miles from my home here in Winter Garden!   The Urban Flats that was in this location (which I really liked)  moved to Plant St in the older historic section of downtown Winter Garden and Red Robin moved in!  Like any new place to eat in this area of Orlando, it gets swamped with people trying something new so Red Robin will be busy for the next few months.   I went on a Friday night around 7 pm with my husband for dinner.  The parking for that location is small compared to the amount of businesses offered  so finding a place to park was a challenge.  We ended up parking down by the Panda Express and then walking a few blocks back to Red Robin.  When we approached the door, a nice greeter welcomed us and asked how many in our party.  I said just the two of us and she said great, follow me!  We totally just walked in and sat at a table for two in the bar area. That was fine with us since there were many larger parties waiting to be seated.  Within a few moments, a perky young server said hello and asked if we had been to a Red Robin before.  My hubby had been to one many years ago but I was a virgin so she proceeded to tell me about the history of Red Robin and all the food they had to  offer.  You could tell she was new and nervous and the she rehearsed that speech in her head a few dozen times!  She took our drink order and ran off while we checked out the menu.  She popped back to the table a few min later to tell us that the drinks were not ready but would we like to order... we said yes... but then she ran away again.... came back again in a few moments to tell us again that our drinks were not ready... asked again if we were ready to order... we said yes...and then she ran away again.   We were not sure if she did not hear us say yes or she was just nervous.  Finally she arrived with our drinks and took our order.   I got the Blue Cheese burger (something I get at every burger place so I can compare them all against each other) and my hubby got the special Jack Daniels burger.  His came with endless fries but I went with a more healthy option and got a salad with my burger.  No extra charge for replacing the fries with a salad!   Both came out with in about 10 min.   Both burgers were hot and fresh and tasted very good!  There were no leftovers.... I have seen many people on here compare Red Robins burgers to Five Guys burgers.  I have tried both and I think they are both different types of burgers.  Five Guys reminds me of the ones you make yourself in your backyard on your own grill.  Very home made.  But Red Robin's burgers are more of a gourmet type of burger.... more of a restaurant quality vs that homemade type of burger.  So I don't think one is better than the other, i think they are both great burgers, just different types of burgers. The line at the door by this time was growing and you could see they were turning tables as fast as they could.  The staff were all doing a good job trying to be friendly while keeping everyone moving.  I don't want to say I felt a bit rushed but we were never offered any chance to order a dessert (not that we could eat one we were stuffed from our burgers!).  Our sever had come over twice to make sure everything was okay but on her third visit, talked about the Red Robin rewards card and wanted to know if we would sign up for that.  We said yes and she came back with a card (and our check) and said that the meal we just had was already put on our card and counted toward our rewards.   I paid the check and we left.  Atmosphere = 8 Service = 7 Food = 9 We had a nice meal at Red Robin and will be going back again once the newness rubs off and it will not be so busy.  Hopefully we will not feel rushed as we were this trip.  Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-winter-garden?start=60,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004

We went later on a weekend and had no issues with a wait. It was different inside than I expected - there was a full bar and TVs with sports playing - both good very things! I was at first interested in their interesting-sounding milkshake containing beer. That was quickly brushed aside when I discovered they would put vodka in a milkshake! There should seriously be no other kind of milkshake. So amazing!!! The burgers were awesome as well. There were so many that looked good that I will have to go back to try another. One thing I can't praise enough is that the burger is wrapped in paper so it doesn't end up all over the place. Also, the steak fries (the best kind of fries) are bottomless, but after the milkshake and burger, there is no way.

At first, I was overwhelmed by the amount of options for a burger but then soon realized I could only find like two that sounded ""okay"" to get.  The gourmet burger came out with steak fries.  I didn't really find anything gourmet about it (I talk about this more later) .  Really just seemed like a large burger with toppings.  RR features endless steak fries with their burgers but once you eat the burger, you don't really have room for much else (if you're a normal sized person).   The taste...the burger wasn't bad but it wasn't as great as I thought it would be especially with regards to the insane crowds that come to this place.  It was a pretty plain burger, no special sauces or toppings even though I ordered one of the specialty ones.  The overall taste just didn't wow me as being a gourmet burger. For a gourmet burger, I would expect special items...   -  Marinated Burgers (teryaki, sriracha, etc...)   -  Special Cheeses (bleu, goat, buffalo mozzarella, etc...)   -  Specialty Buns (Sourdough, wheat, pretzel, kaiser, etc...)   -  Specialty Toppings (mixed greens, shitake mushrooms, etc...)   -  Specialty Sauces (maple syrup, chipotle, balsamic glaze, etc...) Ideas are limitless for gourmet.  If you want a good sit down burger, check out Teak Neighborhood Grill.  If you want a good fast burger, check out That One Spot.  These are gourmet and you can actually find a parking spot.

We were seated pretty quick however and the waitress arrived soon after. Since it was my first time to Red Robin I decided to get the ""famous"" cheesburger. The food took a real long time (I think I drank 5 or 6 sodas before it arrived). The fries were good, hot, and better than the usual chain fries, but not as good as Five Guys. The burger was good, but definitely not gourmet. It was overdone (I asked for medium and this was slightly dry and burnt), and tasted like a Bubba Burger I could've gotten from the grocery store (don't get me wrong, I like Bubba Bugers but they are NOT a ""gourmet"" item). The burger had all the correct fixings and all were fresh, the bun was ok too (nothing special). The kids got Mac and Cheese so I tried a taste. I think it was right out of the Kraft box and appears they didn't even try to make it better :( So if you're looking for an ok burger and don't mind the wait (must not be many places in Winter Garden to eat), then Red Robin is a good place to go.

The trip to Winter Garden was an easy drive although the parking is very inadequate for the number of restaurants. Once inside, we were cheerfully greeted and promptly seated. The menu has a lot of exciting choices but I already had a craving for the classic gourmet burger with a chocolate shake. At last minute, I decided to add a bowl of french onion soup since this was the one cold day we have had this year. My last minute decision proved to be a mistake. The cheese on the soup was melted but no sign of browning from a broiler. The soup tasted like canned beef consomme and the onions were  undercooked and crunchy. Fortunately the burger was amazing - cooked to perfection (medium rare) then topped with onion, pickle, relish, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. The chocolate shake was equally amazing and obviously made from fresh vanilla ice cream with Hershey's syrup added for perfect color and taste. Our server was friendly and very attentive and even other servers came by to make sure our needs were met - true teamwork!

The food was good. I didn't actually have a burger. I went for the California Chicken (or something close to that.) It was pretty good and so were the fries. I think next time I got I want to try a burger. The service was alright. I was iffy about our waitress and then when I started being sarcastic with her she seemed to open up a bit and was jokey and nicer. (Phew!) I'd go back to try it again, through I won't be rushing.

Parking was quite challenging.  But luckily, there wasn't a wait to be seated since there was only two of us.  As soon as we walked in, it felt ridiculously loud. We were seated in the bar and I felt like I was yelling to talk to my friend.  We both ordered burgers and found that the edges we completely charred. Once you were to the center they were pretty good.  I had also asked for some kind of cheese sauce to dip my fries in. My server looked at me like I had 2 heads. I guess they don't get asked for that. I was told they only had a beer cheese sauce that goes with the pretzel bread and it would cost $1.50. That was fine. I was willing to pay for it. Then he forgot to get it and I had to ask again. Once he brought it, he said I was lucky because it was just given to him and I wouldn't have to pay. I was glad because it wasn't that good. It had a strange gritty texture. Maybe better with the pretzel bread.  If I was looking for a similar burger, I would go to Steak N Shake instead.

106,Atnier R.,"Monroe, CT",18,121,73.0,4.0,2013-02-14,"I had heard of Red Robin before, but it had never been at a fuel-friendly distance.  That changed when one popped up in the neighboring Winter Garden (the nice Dr. Phillips-like part, not the areas that look like Kissimmee's trailers had an impromptu wild race across business parking lots).  We were meeting some friends there and we were quickly approached, directed to a table and attended.    The ambiance is definitely jovial.  The décor is diner style meets TGI Friday's pop culture. You are surrounded by vivid red walls and colorful signs.  There's a bar too, in case you want to imbibe.  All in all, it's a bright-lit, fun place to eat in.  Katy Perry would approve.  There are many burgers to choose from, so I opted for a Prime Chophouse (horseradished sautéed mushrooms, Provolone cheese, and crispy onion straws, served on an onion bun with Dijon sauce).  The rest of the table ordered the Banzai (has pineapples and teriyaki sauce), the All-American Patty Melt (onions, thousand island dressing on marbled rye bread) and a Whiskey River BBQ.    Everybody enjoyed their burgers (and patty melt) and they all come with bottomless fries (it's off-season for sumo, so I didn't refill my basket).  I was a bit reluctant to get anything with horseradish (Panera Bread needs to tone it down a tad), but I was happy with my choice after devouring it.  It didn't look like the menu picture though, since the squashed crispy onion straws could only be seen if you lifted the top of the burger, so imagine the menu picture of it after placing a Galapagos turtle on top of the bun.  For drinks, I had a Very Berry Raspberry Limeade which was okay.  My girlfriend ordered a Raspberry Sweet Tea which was over-sweetened, but after the first cavity-pleasing sips, it was more drinkable.  Service was a bit off-pace but this might be due to being a new place and getting slammed (on a Monday night!).  The waiter asked us for our choices multiple times in a span of 7 minutes, but the burgers took a long time to appear on our table, to the point of me drinking all of my limeade and a portion of my girlfriend's sweet tea while pondering if they were still hacking away at the dead cow.  But once the burgers arrived, my hunger was pleasantly satiated.  So considering the affordable price, the ambiance, the burgers, the service and the location, I do recommend this place if you are around the area.  I don't think I would trek it all the way to Winter Garden for the experience (I do make the long journey for Yellow Dog Eats, which is near Winter Garden), but if I'm somehow around the area, it is definitely a place to consider for lunch/dinner/second breakfast/second lunch.  If they do raise a Red Robin closer to my humble abode in posh Kissimmee (a bit overstated yes), I would venture that I'd visit it more often than other similar establishments.  It seems to be cheaper than Johnny Rocket's (though I haven't checked their shakes, and Rocket is prominently adjacent to the Loop's cinema which I frequent), it seems to be a good rival to Five Guys (I actually think their burgers tasted better than Five Guys' or at least close enough, and the ambiance obviously beats the peanut sacks and red/white tiles of the minimalist Five Guys'), and is fresh and cool enough to entice before boredom and familiarity sets in (last couple of years I have been to TGI Friday's so many times, I'm practically a churchgoer).  So there you go.  Give Red Robin a try and maybe you'll add another casual restaurant to your rotation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-winter-garden?start=100,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.0560000000000005

I've had several of their burgers, and all have been good.  Their bottomless fries are fun when you're hungry, and they'll make you garlic fries if you ask (they sound better than they actually taste, imo).   I ordered a salted caramel shake, and asked them to put a bit of chocolate syrup in it, and it was crazy good.  I don't know if I can ever go back and not order it, that's how good it was.  They even have a veggie patty so my vegetarian wife can go and actually enjoy it instead of just eating fries and onion rings. So, -1 star for the service.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive, but the kitchen is unbelievably, painfully slow.  That Saturday where I was there when they opened- there were maybe a dozen people in the restaurant after they unlocked the doors and sat us, and it took no less than 45 minutes to get two burgers.  Criminey, did they have to start the grill by rubbing two sticks together or something?  How long does it take a kitchen team to make food first thing in the morning?

The food does not disappoint - great ""burger"" genre (I don't really eat burgers, but love the chicken sandwiches or ""clucks"" and fries - AKA chicken fingers). Bottomless fries? Magical.  The reason I have to give this place 3 out of 5 stars is because it's such a pain to park and the whole environment is just small / crammed. No breathing room, right down to the tiny crowded sidewalk outside the door where people wait for a table. It seems like a lot of people have been waiting for a Red Robin to come to Central Florida for years - it would have probably been a good idea to choose a location that could easily accommodate the crowds.

I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by both the atmosphere and the food itself.  As far as the atmosphere goes, Red Robin has a lively, modern-meets-classic feel to it with bright neon lighting and hundreds of framed pictures alongside modern furnishings and a bar serving a variety of craft brews, as well as traditional selections. I found myself enjoying this environment especially considering that I was expecting something more similar to a diner-style atmosphere.  Additionally, the food itself was better than I anticipated as well. Although the term 'gourmet burger' is used to describe Red Robin's burgers, I would almost argue that what they serve here is really more of a souped-up traditional American burger. Although there are a wide variety of toppings and options on each burger, the essentials are there--big fat bun, big fat patty, and big fat toppings, with bottomless wedge fries as well of course. And even with the fries you have options--regular, parmesan garlic, or sweet potato, all of which are delicious. And honestly that's the other great thing I love about this restaurant: the wide variety of options. In addition to a variety of burgers, there are also salads, chicken dinners, and even fish and chips on the menu! All I can really say is that when it comes to Red Robin, I am sold.

57,Nicholas I.,"Orlando, FL",32,56,127.0,4.0,2013-09-30,"I'm definitely a fan of Red Robin. After constantly seeing commercials for this place, but never wanting to make the trip that was St.Cloud to Winter Garden just for a burger (which, by the way, was worth it), I finally came to the conclusion that it had to be done sometime. So, here' s my inevitable Yelp review!  I must say, this place was jam packed when I got here, and continued to be that way all through the night. ""Must be a good sign!"" I thought. Was it? Well, let's read on...  The decor of Red Robin was funky, and cool. Not too different, probably because chain restaurants aren't necessarily known for their crazy displays, but it did add some type of character. Kind of like a classic American Dinner/Bar/Normal Restaurant  kind of feel. Something you might see on 'Dinners, Drive-Ins, and Dives', maybe.  When we walked in, we were quickly attended to by the lady that sets up your seat. (I can't remember their title, sad, I know.) Soon after, we were seated and greeted by a cool waiter! He was funny and definitely had some experience under his belt. Being as packed as it was, you would think there would be some type of delay in the waiter's service, but no way. He was on spot.  Now, comes the food. I was with a party of 5, so we had a large array of items. Mine was the Red's Tavern Burger. And I was quite happy with my pick when all was said and done. Plus, the bottomless fries (which yes, I did have a second serving...) made sure you would not leave hungry. But, more on the burger; it was delish! Melted american cheese, with a juicy burger, buttery and soft bun, and some great toppings. Boy was it good! And I'm usually a chicken kind of guy! Everyone else also enjoyed their picks. One of the people I was with got the Bleu Ribbon Burger, and I got the chance to take bite. I must say, it was delicious as well. Clearly, the fact that this place was packed was a good sign.

I had a chicken sandwich and it was alright as far as grilled chicken sandwiches go. I ordered the 'Simply Grilled' chicken sandwich and that's exactly what is was. This was alright since I'm trying to stick to a lower calorie diet. I did choose the fruit salad as a side and that was disappointing.

40,Francisco M.,"Orlando, FL",45,995,1666.0,5.0,2013-12-22,"Yummmmmm...is the perfect description for these burgers. We have been visiting Red Robin since they opened their doors in Florida. We started with the tower of their famous onion rings. These rings are crispy and they range in size. I ordered the French Onion Soup and I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was. It was loaded with melted cheese and the broth was filled with flavor. I had the Smoke & Pepper Limited Edition Burger and is was delicious. It was loaded with a Black Angus Beef patty with smoked salt, black pepper bacon and cheddar cheese. The one thing I don't really care for at Red Robin are the fries. They are fresh but for me a bit too big. They are more like Steak Fries. I usually substitute one of the many sides for the fries.  Be sure to try the Freckled Lemonade. They use fresh strawberries and they mix it with their lemonade recipe and its really refreshing. It's free refills so you can drink as many as you like. It reminds me of the Strawberry Lemonade at the State Fair.  Be sure to signup for their Red Robin Royalty Program. It's free to signup and for every 10 burgers you purchase, you get one free. You also get a free burger on your birthday. Just this year alone I have received 4 burgers free and you can't beat free.  Service is always very good at this location. You usually have to wait for a table because it's always packed. The wait is never more than 15 minutes and it's worth waiting.

Two things to know about going here, it is very noisy when full, most likely due to the large, open design.  The other is that parking is at a premium here.  If you find a spot anywhere in the vicinity, take it quickly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-winter-garden?start=40,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.2440000000000007,3.3200000000000003

Not in the ""I want a gourmet burger with fancy toppings I can't pronounce"" way, but in the ""Wow, I need a burger now or I'll go crazy"" way. The burger portions are quite large and the burger flavors varied. They also have bottomless fries, but I challenge anyone to actually eat a second or third serving. I usually walk out so full that I feel sick and I don't finish my first serving of fries. Unless you have a big appetite, I say skip the appetizer and save a few bucks. You seriously don't need it. Also, be sure to sign up for the loyalty club. They give you free stuff (think burgers). Who doesn't love free? Now for the bad. While Red Robin is good, their parking lot seriously SUCKS.

Not all Red Robin locations live up to my standards; this one does. Although people often have the misconception that their food is unhealthy, it's not.

The Rewards program alone is another reason to go especially on birthdays when you get a free burger, and who can resist the unlimited fries? My husband can really take down a few baskets so that is another reason to love this place. My favorite burger they have is the Burning love burger, but sadly since becoming pregnant anything with the word burning in the description or title is no help to heart burn so i have ventured out and tried other burgers since. The Prime chop house burger was the most recent adventure and I have to say that burger was fantastic! There was also a visit where for some reason as I was looking at the menu i started having a craving for a frito chili pie burger which they have a chili burger on their menu so i had asked the waitress if they by chance had fritos, she said no and i was okay with that but for some reason the baby wanted what she wanted, so when i told the lady it was just a passing craving i went ahead and ordered the chili burger anyways, when our food came out i had found a bag of fritos on the plate along side my burger! The waitress who said she felt bad for pregnant women and their cravings ran four buildings and across the street over to the local Valero and bought a bag of fritos so that I could have my burger! Who else would do such a thing? So another reason why we love this location for sure! I also recommend the Spinach artichoke dip for a starter! The freckled lemonades are always another thing i love drinking as well or the tea. If you get in the mood for a sinfully great dessert and actually have a group to eat with you I also recommend the mudslide ice cream pie, but be prepared to have a few co eaters otherwise that thing won't go down with a fight!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-winter-garden?start=140,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.156,3.5600000000000005

We finally put our order in and our food came before we even saw our drinks. Not exact my preferred order of operations. The food was good, my burger was well cooked and seasoned. My fries came served in a tin cup and I probably had 10 French fries total served with my meal. Not what I remember from the old ""bottomless French fries"" that I'm used to. The waitress was more attentive after we had our food continuing to stop by to see if we wanted more fries for drinks. We ordered another round of fries for 3 people and when she came back it has about 11 fries in the basket.....so yea I was definitely disappointed on how Red Robin has changed.

The burgers are served with tasty steak fries that are supposedly AYCE, but it usually feels like the staff is instructed to limit the customer to only a second serving.

Not for my waistline, but for this marvelous burger joint. I've haven't tried that many versions of their burgers, but that's mostly because I got hooked on the royal. That's the burger with bacon and a fried egg on top... excuse me while I regulate my salivary glands.  They offer you a burger with some pink or no pink but if you know whats good for you, you'll get some pink, because you should. Also the bottomless fries (or steamed broccoli or side salad for the same price). The fries are thick and awesome, the broccoli is fresh, and the side salad is just meh, because it's a side salad and I want it to taste like fries but dang it I'm trying to be good.

I normally don't drink soda but I can't say no to a root beer float, especially when they keep bringing you more and one to go. (My record is 4.) They also have really good alcoholic shakes.  Also, I noticed that people have complained quite frequently about wait times before and after they get seated here. I have not experienced this and I have been here at all hours of the day. The only time I had to wait was my first time there. But it was less than 20 min at 9pm on a Friday night and they texted me when my time came so we didn't have to wait in the tiny waiting area.

If you haven't been, it's a fairly new chain to Central Florida competing for a share of the burger market.  The server was quick to arrive and take our drink order. We decided to try the poutine appetizer, a new addition to the menu for Oktoberfest (odd since it's a Canadian dish). Drinks came out quickly, too. I ordered the Royal (sunny side up egg,  bacon, cheese); Wife orders mushroom swiss burger; Buddy orders fish n chips. About 15 minutes pass before we see our server again,  sans poutine, asking what I'm drinking (empty glass).  Ten minutes more and our burgers arrive. Still no poutine; I request camp fire sauce. Fries were room temperature for all three of us. Odd, since it took nearly 30 minutes for the food to arrive. We all order more fries, since they are ""bottomless"". My burger was fantastic, except the runny white. Sunny side up can be tough, but you can clearly see that it wasn't cooked enough. Otherwise, my burger was delicious. The other two main courses pleased Wife and Buddy. Server shows up, and Wife mentions the poutine, which the server says wasnt his fault and promises to have it removed.  All the of us finish our food before the fries,  nice and hot, arrive at the table.  We are asked to pay on a computer (for which I am not a fan), and the poutine is on there.  Once corrected, I pay and give a poor review on the tabletop pc. No manager visits the table.  The server checks back to see if we paid, and offers to-go drinks, but never returns.  This was probably my seventh time here, and the one excellent server we had (last visit) was obviously an anomaly.  The burger market is vast.

63,Daniel T.,"Apopka, FL",1,25,12.0,1.0,2016-05-18,"I  will start by saying that we love the Red Robin concept, as we first discovered it when we lived in the suburbs of St. Louis. We were very excited when we discovered than Red Robin was coming to the Orlando area. However, this location in Winter Garden has soured us on Red Robin, so much so, that I am giving them a 1 star review and never returning to this location.   Everytime we come here, there is a problem with the meal experience, and today's dinner was more of the same.  The issues started when we first walked in, I told the hostess we are a party of 3, and needed a kids menu. The hostess told me that they are out of kids menus, so they sat us down in a booth with 3 regular menus. After ordering my food, I went to the restroom, and there were no paper towels to dry my hands. When our food arrived, my daughters meal was wrong. She had ordered her favorite, the teriyaki chicken dippers.  They brought her the fried chicken tenders (my daughter is one of the few kids that does not liked fried chicken).  The waitresses apologized for the mistake, and had her meal remade by the kitchen. By the time her chicken was brought out, my wife and I had already finished eating.  A gentleman that seemed to be a manager type person brought out her plate, and again a quick apology for the mistake. Again there was a problem with her meal. The kitchen sent ranch sauce in place of teriyaki. We notified this manager of the mistake, and he said it would get taken care of. 10 minutes later a food runner brought out the sauce, to me that is very lazy of this manager.  The issue with my daughter's meals is a common theme at this location. My burger was good, the waitresses was nice, and the re-order of french fries was very slow to come out. All in all, I am still a fan of Red Robin. I will not be returning to this location any more. I will go to either Sanford or I-Drive when I want to get my Red Robin fix.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-winter-garden?start=40,3.12,3.13,3.13,3.172,3.126

A mermorable one for me was the ramen burger.  Using ramen noodles as a bun and burger flavored kind of like teryiaki... it was delicious and also very messy.  Most recently had a millionaire baby burger where they pawned off a frozen hashbrown for a ""potato cake""  Overall, good burger joint when you want something ""creative"" and different. AYCE steak fries, garlic parmesian fries, sweet potato fries, or brocoli can't hurt either!  Service is hit or miss.  Good spot for a quick chainy burger when in the Groves to shop.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-winter-garden,3.8,3.29,3.29,,3.494

They have great gourmet burgers that are cooked as requested with toppings I'd never think to put on a burger but are always delicious. Unlimited fries and dipping sauces are a plus and I love those chocolate fruffles with raspberry sauce. For an early Friday night this location was very busy so we had about a 30 minute wait. That was fine because we got to watch the balloons fall all over the entrance every time the door opened. When we were seated, we all ordered burgers and sweet teas. Everything came out timely and was delicious!! Our server though was very distracted and short with us. It was more of a mission to get us to eat quickly to get the next customers in. Not to mention drink refills didn't exist until our meals were done which at that point we just felt it best to leave.

With that being said, our server Samantha was the best server we have had ever during one of our visits. She was so interactive and attentitive with us and made sure we all had what we needed and if something wasn't right, she made sure she made it right.  I ordered a Pina Colada  on the rocks, which is a new twist on the old frozen favorite. It's the same mix of alcohols without the brain freeze, in fact I think I like it better. For my dinner I chose the Buzz Mac and Cheese Tavern Burger sans the bun along with the bottomless fries. I have never had this burger before so I decided this would be a nice change from the norm. It had pepper jack along with a layer of their Buzz Mac and Cheese. Absolutely delicious.  Since three of our friends were celebrating birthdays, Samantha gathered a group of the employees together along with 3 ice cream sundaes and they proceeded to sing a special birthday song for them. It was fantastic.  Since it wasnt my birthday, I decided to indulge in the Mile High Ice Cream Pie. It was huge and covered in Whipped Cream and sprinkles. Huge enough to share. So yummy... This was a fantastic evening and this is why we keep coming back to celebrate with our friends every year.

It's sad to say because the restaurant seemed to be normal and our service was good it was just the food that was horrible. We ordered onion ring to start that were full of grease. Then we got our burgers. The meat in the burger seemed frozen and it has no flavor at all. The bun was full of grease and so were my garlic fries. My husband's burger was the same but had more grease. When we looked around we saw people around us ordering salads and were confused because this was a burger joint. Anyways, I would not recommend this place to anyone. We left feeling very weird about the food. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!

22,Yi Jing L.,"Winter Garden, FL",67,88,155.0,2.0,2017-09-13,"Went there on 9/12/17 around 6PM.  They were super busy with bunch of stores closed due to out of power.  I understand it going to be a longer wait time and with it been so busy, there quality may not be at it best.  We got a table for 7+1 after 25 minutes wait, which is not bad.  We got our order in quickly and told the server it going to be separated check.  We also got a birthday coupon and notified the server.  Everything was clear and upfront hoping to make the transition easy and smooth. (ehh wrong)   I got a bleu burger which was cold with warm french fried.  My friend got a fish and chip that's not cook all the way.  The flour on the fish was still powder and wet.  I did got my order remake and definitely make the whole different.  My friend didn't want the fish n chip and was thinking about getting something else.  However, it almost 10 minutes went by when they finally brought a menu to her to see if she wanted something else.  She didn't order anything else because its getting super late and we got a baby in our group.    We asked for our check.  Server was gone for 15 minutes ( later we found out she trying to split our check and having pc system problem doing so).  The table ""tablet"" was out of battery.  Finally, she just came back with a new one and said "" I cant split the check, here the machine, maybe your guys can figure it out.  Sorry"")  Awesome.  So, I trying to use the split check function on the tablet but it only able to split the check into 2.  Then it wont take our birthday coupon.  I ended up need to ask a manager for help.   Probably another 15 minutes waiting for manager.  she finally show up.  BUT WITH AN ATTITUDE.  She was mad/busy/frustrate/. I can understand its super busy and she got a bunch of stuff to deal with.  BUT DONT TAKE IT UPON US.  She like "" I was back there trying to help your guys splitting the check but it wont do it. the system keep freezing up.  Your guys should not try to split the check on the tablet..... it happened before ....ect ect"" (1- I'm sorry YOUR system suck and no one did anything about it.  2- I never work at red robin before and I forgot to bring my magic spiral ball, SO I didn't know beforehand.  3- maybe void the whole check.  ring it up separately? or just come to us in the beginning and tell us there a system error ? )   Anyway, she took cared of the bill at the end.  I just don't understand why she been so rude. lol.  I rather she apologize for the inconvenience or just act professional.  I rather pay for it,  only like $12 per person?  not that the food that night worth it but still, no big deal.  Good thing we got some cash on us and able to tip the server.   We just left all confuse and actually find it quite funny at the same time.  In conclusion, I understand it's super busy but having an attitude and being rude definitely wont help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-winter-garden,3.76,3.25,3.25,,3.454

It's not her fault I just don't think when it's busy like that they should have some help so the customer isn't waiting like that. We always know when we go it will be awhile so we have that in or head so we don't expect much for service. The food however is always great. They have some of the best burgers! Tons of flavor, never dry. I love customizing mine. This place is a must try but if you are or ever were a server you'll hate it here just bc of that and just expect long service here...that's at the bar or in the restaurant. I'm not sure why it's always like this. I'll be back bc I love the burgers I just wish for the price you spend that the service would be great to.

My favorite burger is the Chili Chili Cheeseburger burger. It comes with chili on the burger. It's messy, but very tasty. This location is very convenient from the shopping plaza from across the street. The staff here is always pleasant, efficient attentive service, and the restaurant is always clean. Our server was very attentive and took great care of us during our visit.  Try a Blue Moon milk shake because it is delightful in flavor of the beer with the milk shake mix. It complaints the burger very well.  Not familiar with Red Robin? They specialize in various types of burgers with unique toppings. From chili to mac & cheese. They offer various sauces for the burger as well. Love steak fries? I do!! They offer dipping sauces for your fries from ranch to a garlic sauce. Yummy! They will keep bring you fries upon request for no additional charge. Not a fan of burgers? No worries because they offer chicken, fish, and salads. My friends love the Freckle Lemonade. It has a strawberry flavor with lemonade and real strawberries in it. Love Rootbeer Floats? They have bottomless Rootbeer floats. Red Robin is known to be the highest calorie restaurant ever and I do believe it. The burgers alone have high calories. The food taste great overall. Just be careful to over indulge in the treats. They have tasty onion rings as well.  Overall I am very satisfied with this Red Robin.
