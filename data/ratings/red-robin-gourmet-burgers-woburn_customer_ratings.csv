71,Shirley V.,"Burlington, MA",0,3,,5.0,2016-12-03,Omg!! I can't believe they opened a Red Robin near me. This is my favorite burger place. Ultimate favorite?

Our waitress debbie was very nice gave all the information about the new restaurant, rewards card, menu etc.. the food servers still a little confused about what table the food is going ( just getting to know the table #'s) the wait for food was not very long for a trail run..good job.

72,Sarah B.,"Financial District, Boston, MA",103,2,1.0,3.0,2016-12-20,"I was super stoked when I saw that we were getting a Red Robin in Woburn and I was really excited to visit today. I've been to Red Robin once before, but this experience was not what I hoped it would be. Our server was absolutely lovely and the restaurant had an awesome atmosphere and overall great staff, but our food was pretty terrible. My boyfriend got ""wings"", which were essentially chicken nuggets with a pretty nasty sauce on them. I ended up getting the G.D.B., which sounded really good on paper, but was actually pretty disgusting. Willing to try the location again and order a different item, but overall pretty disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woburn?start=60,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412
46,Steven M.,"Burlington, MA",34,5,,4.0,2016-12-22,"Went on 12/21 for dinner as they just opened to the public 2 days earlier.  We were seated almost immediately, but the wait staff didn't show up for almost 15 mins.. I think that they forgot about us.  Once I flagged somebody down, the rest of the meal was on-time, and they were attentive.  I will chalk this up to opening week and working out the kinks. I have been to the locations in Nashua NH as well as the one in Foxborough, MA.  This experience was very similar  - the burger was very good, and the unlimited fries was a bonus.  I love that they will put a fried egg (or numerous other toppings) on your burger if you want.  My kids enjoyed the kids menu as there were lots of choices. I much prefer this experience versus going to Five Guys or WuBurger or B.Good as all of those are counter service... Another counter service one is Bobby Flay Burger Palace in the Burlington Mall.  I enjoy Bobby Flay's as it is a very trendy and hipster vibe to it, but just not the same as a sit down place with waiter service.   The closest competition I would see would be Johnny Rockets in Burlington MA but that isn't as good,   Another similar feeling place might be Dave & Buster's in Woburn but boy is it loud in there with the focus on arcade games versus food.   So, of all of these places, I would pick Red Robin if you are hankering for a really good burger with lots of choices/varieties.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woburn?start=40,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544
45,Claudia A.,"Stoneham, MA",2,20,2.0,2.0,2016-12-23,"Red Robin on the South Shore happens to be one of my daughter's favorite burger place. So when we found out that a new one opened in Woburn, we were very excited to try it out. Unfortunately, it was really disappointing. First, the wait was originally 20 minutes which turned into a 40-minute wait, not sure why since the place was half empty. We sat at a high tables and order drinks which were a 20minute wait and it took us asking 3 times to get water for the table.  Finally, when they sat us at the table and the food came, it was incredibly salty, and I like salty, but could only take a couple of bites. So the food was not the greatest but the service was even worse! We got the wrong dishes a couple of times and waited a long time for drinks, we even had to share napkins because they didn't bring enough to the table.  This is a new place and I'm not sure if they are still in training mode, but there is no reason for the food not to be consistent from place to place.  We will not be going back here anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woburn?start=40,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248
27,Goku U.,"Boston, MA",196,341,439.0,3.0,2016-12-24,"Came here on a Friday while driving to New Hampshire. We didn't realize that this location recently opened until we browsed other yelp reviews. The restaurant was clean and maintained well. When we walked into a half empty restaurant around 3pm, the hostess wanted to sit us next to another occupied table when there were at least ten other open tables. When I asked if we could instead get a one of two open booths, they said no. So finally they gave in and let us sit at a table next to the window. Come on red Robin, your restaurant is more than half empty and I would rather have a little privacy while I eat. Please don't sit groups right next to one another. The dining experience here is about different than other restaurants. Each table has this little tablet where you can order drinks, apps, call the server, and pay your bill (it even prints your receipt). It's pretty cool, but I really hope they clean that touchscreen.  Ok on to the food, we ordered the keep it simple and the big ghost with endless broccoli and garlic parmesan fries. The burger was pretty standard. The big ghost was too greasy with fried jalapenos inside. It actually wasn't that spicy. There are two versions - the big ghost and fiery tavern. Our waitress charged us for the big ghost ($2 more) but we weren't sure what the difference was. The sad broccoli was frozen and tasted like mush. The garlic parmesan fries were soaked with grease - it was really unpleasant to see and eat. When we asked our waitress for just regular fries, she said the garlic ones were already made. So we left the basket untouched since it was greasier than the time before. It was disappointing that she didn't want to just put another order in. Paying time. So we swiped our card at our table tablet and selected tip. We wanted to get water before leaving so we tried to call our waitress from the table but she was no where to be found. We ended up just walking to the bar and got our water refilled as we stood there awkwardly.  Overall, this red Robin location was OK. We think there are some improvements on service and food that should be made.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woburn,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348

I was a bit disappointed they weren't doing milkshakes yet. But I grabbed a seat at the bar,  Try grabbing a seat at the bar if you can to get in quicker. The wait is pretty crazy right now due to Christmas break and that the location just opened. the corporate trainer manager is still on site  as of 12/30/2016 .  So just be prepared to wait a bit right now. it should get better wait times once the kids go back to school and such and the opening week stuff dies off. Overall its a good place. Judy and Co. at the bar are awesome and both are local gals. The bar has nice selection of beer and wines...vodka etc. and tv's. Plenty of booths nad plenty of parking. Right close to the Washington St. Exit off 128 .....about 10 min down the highway from the movie theater 15 from Burlington Mall. 10 from Stoneham Redstone shopping center area . 20 from Wakefield.Lynnfield. North shore./Salem area. depends on Boston traffic of course. Service was a bit slow but I understood it was opening week so they are still learning and it will pick up as the waitresses learn the menu and they learn everything. its a learning experience for everyone so give it a few weeks to iron things out and it will be fine. The same thing happened at the black horse tavern when it opened in Winchester took ema year or two to get going and iron things out and then it took off. Same will happen with Red Robin give it time The food is delicious though  and affordable and I will be back. Overalll its a great alternative to the mall or a good place to go on the way to the movie at Showcase Woburn or AMC burlington =)  Expect to wait a bit especially this next week or so with the opening week and vacation week. and during Feb break for two weeks when the kids are off of school it will be jammed again. Go betwen jan 2nd and Feb break and you should be fine.  The bartender told me it dies off after 3pm and picks up again around 5pm so in between during rush hour commute would be a good time to come in.

She brought out my correct order,  but half only in one of the silver cups where they usually put the excess.  That was it.  Also, I had a sandwich and the sides of the bread were hard as a rock.  We then ordered a refill on the kids meal which the kitchen got confused and took forever to come out.  The manager delivered it and just said...""sorry about that.""  Nothing else.  This is fine, but I feel they should have at least offered the malt at no cost.  Very disappointing experience although I know they have recently opened.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woburn?start=80,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000005
54,Mike R.,"Belmont, MA",0,148,,2.0,2017-01-01,"The Burgers and fries are okay.  The service however is just horrible.  This seems to be the case with most new restaurants.   It seemed that the waitress had not been a waitress very long.  No smile, no real welcome...   We asked for two minutes to look at the menu and then we didn't see her again for 15 minutes. We showed up at 11:45am, so it was not very busy yet. It is a fairly big restaurant but they seemed to seat everyone with kids, or maybe just everyone, in the same area which made it extra hectic and loud in our section, even tough I was able to stare at a completely empty section just ten feet away.       Anyway, the food was okay and not too expensive.   But there are a lot of other places with good burgers and fries around, where the service will be much better.  My recommendation: give this place a few months so the wait staff, hostesses and management get some experience.   Otherwise, be prepared to be aggravated... Personally, I doubt we will go back.  Judging from the other reviews, the way they seat everyone together seems to be the way they do things.  With two kids, you just need some space.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woburn?start=40,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000004

It's gonna go nuts here soon cause the food is really good.  Watch the apps or you may not finish your burger. Fries comes with the burger so don't do the app, onion rings are illegal & come large or small.  Our server today was great but seemed overwhelmed.  Nice alcohol choices.

The service, although friendly,  was a disaster.  Where do we start?  The bar was so dirty with ton of used, empty glasses that were not cleared, but just pushed aside for people to sit or maybe the long long wait to get a drink sitting at the bar (more than 10 minutes to get acknowledged)? Or maybe the fact that they did not even have any clean glassware at the bar (probably because it was not being cleared) and had to go into the back to get a wine glass? Seriously not a good impression.  Then after waiting... our table was given away.... They ask for your phone number and tell you they will text you when your table is ready.  We confirmed we would be sitting at the bar while waiting. At the bar we were not in ear-shot, which was apparently a no-no. We were told that were calling our name out in waiting area for a ""long time"".   By the time they decided to actually text us and we went to get our seat, they had given away our table because we did not respond to the verbal calling of our name.  Finally the table service...again, friendly, but not very good service.  My order ended up on someone else's bill and it took a while for it to be corrected.

There were even people waiting for takeout orders sitting in chairs at the bar totally preventing the bartenders from making any money.  There was a line of people at the door waiting for a table and people were regularly glancing over to the bar looking for open seats.  Id be pissed if I learned people sitting at the bar taking chairs wernt even being served. Management needs to move takeout service away from the bar and put it at the front door or at least designate an area for it. In the meantime they should also prevent people waiting for takeout from sitting at the bar.   Also I saw a waiter servicing tables who was touching all the straws on the end you put your lips on as he put them into drinks.

We got there at 630pm and it was much more crowded than I was expecting. We were sat quickly and the kids immediately started playing with the wedge on the table. Our waiter came over quickly to take our drink order and was extremely patient with 2 13 year olds trying to decide on apps. We ordered a salted caramel shake, berry lemonade, fried pickles, fried zucchini sticks and fried cheese curds to start. It came out quickly and they were delicious. For dinner we had a chicken avo-cabo salad (cute name, huge salad), a bruchetta chicken sandwich and a double stack burger. All were enjoyed - particularly the salad. The steak fries were ok, not a huge hit. They are bottomless, but we didn't want or need more. Paying at the wedge on the table was super quick and easy.

Another, the waitress disappeared for 10 minutes before returning with my credit card. It's this annoying pace that gets on my nerves for the Woburn location. Others visits, it was the lack of communication between bussers and our waitress. Some random person brought over the fries early like I asked but then the waitress shows up with the same thing a few minutes later.  The food itself has always been well prepared, flavorful and brings me back. We have loved our drinks, from the pineapple pina colada style smoothie to the shakes. I am in love with the ""prime chophouse"" burger and dont ever have problems with their silly jargon on how it's cooked. But they need to get the concept of actually having someone serve you one-on-one down to a science before it becomes an afterthought and we go elsewhere.

30,chris p.,"Arlington, MA",7,13,19.0,1.0,2017-03-27,"I'm just giving them 1 Star for the decent food. Me and my gf went here last Sunday (26/Mar) and the only good thing about this place was the plentiful parking.  So this late Sunday afternoon we were craving a burger, so I remember there is a red Robin open near by. Now I was thinking, I've been to the one in Patriot place, and that one was fine, this should be ok. Boy was I wrong. We should have went to fuddruckers like I originally was thinking, or even wuburger.  So we get there and it takes about 5 mins to be acknowledged, as we were 1 group of people standing in the reception area by what felt like some guy who could care less that we were there. He seats us in a mostly empty dining room at these​ high back chairs, which were kind of comfy.  A manager comes over and takes our drink order and app order after we have been sitting there for about 15 mins. Another 10 mins later she comes back with our drinks, and we order our burgers. I got the black and bleu, my gf got the patty melt. Now before our food came out, a new waitress and not the original woman came over and confirmed our order, which I thought was weird, however she was our waitress. The burgers were decent, fries were kind of hot, but not really crispy. Very meh food.  It took another 10 mins for the app to come out, then probably 20 for the burgers to come out. At this point, we haven't seen our waitress at all. After she confirmed our order she disappeared. We finished our food and sat there for another 15 mins as she never checked on us one time, until she noticed we had finished at some time. She never asked how the food was she just said if your paying by card you pay on the kiosk, and she removed our plates and walked off.  Look I get it, your a burger joint, it's not supposed to be super attentive service, however that's not how you operate a sit down restaurant. With that terrible level of service I doubt I will ever patronize another red Robin again. If I wanted better service, I would have went to fuddruckers, at least there I know the food is good, and everything else is self serve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woburn,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.6360000000000001,2.0
86,Brenda W.,"Woburn, MA",0,11,,3.0,2017-04-07,"4/7/17 Friday night. Know your busy. But....got a seat right away, good when you are in a wheelchair. Then waited, & waited, & waited for our server. Finally James stopped by. Took our drink orders, app & food orders. Drinks came right away (a strawberry & a chocolate monster shakes, my hubby & I swap the metal tins so we each get both), the app came in a reasonable time. Our dinner, well, we waited, & waited. Then James comes with them & said ""this is what happened guys"". All the blame on the kitchen. We ate our meal, decided to pay cash & had to find James. We turned on the 'call server' light. We waited & waited, the table next to ours had theirs on too. He stopped there then ran away, came back a few minutes later with their food. Left. Then came back, to us. WE told him we wanted to pay cash, he said he'd get our check. And we waited & waited. The manager came over to see what we wanted as he hadn't turned off the 'call server' light & we didn't know how. We told her we were waiting on our check. James finally gave it to us & left. After waiting again, turning on the call server light again, he never came back. So, we used our debit card to pay & got the heck out of there. I know Friday nights are busy (we won't come again on Friday night), but, every time we saw James he had another story on how the kitchen was screwing up, & he had had to have a conversation with the manager about it. I do know that if he is on the next time we go in, & we are seated with him as our server, we will be asking to be moved to another server. Nice guy my husband is, he tipped him. I wouldn't have. So, I wrote this instead. The manager helped us get me & the chair out the doors, we said nothing. Just wanted to go home. We love you Red Robin, but, hope this isn't a trend. Just a fluke. We have been to the new Red Robin in Woburn twice since it opened. 12/20/16 and 12/23/16. We have been to the ones in Nashua, Salem, Manchester (all NH) and Foxboro. Now Woburn, what a great Christmas Present! I found an app for my phone that lets me customize any of my burgers, anyway I want it. So, took it with me the first time we went. When ordering I just handed her the phone. It came perfect. Warning, they are still shaking down, so if you dont want your burger quite pink inside, say NO PINK. Then it will have just a bit.  The garlic fries are to die for. Both times we went to this Red Robin we were served a much larger serving of fries than at any of the other ones. Never needed another serving  here in Woburn, got more than enough.  Our servers have been right on with us right away. Very helpful, and friendly. The second time it was crowded and we were told 45 minutes. But, I am in a wheelchair, and they offered us a wheelchair accessible spot at the bar counter. We had a fun floor show to watch while eating. Food was terrific, people terrific, and after watching them make about 25 shakes while we were there I got a chocolate milk shake to go for dessert. Its mostly self serve and tastes wonderful! Will definately be making this place our place to go here in Woburn. Will save us a lot of gas treking up to NH to one of the other Red Robins.  Only problem is that during rush hour we live on the wrong side of Woburn to get there easily.   Oh well, cant have everything.   Been a few more times. I understand that at other burger places the toppings are put on because the beef has no flavor. These do. I've started ordering them Naked, on an onion bun, that's it. The beef is so flavorable toppings take away from the good taste of the meat. But, I'm older & have actually tasted good beef before, the younger generations have been raised on dump stuff on the burger, maybe they won't notice the no flavor of the beef. There is an app out there called the Customizer, You can build your burger or anything else exactly how you want it. Like the Baja Dressing with the taco chips, you can skip it, & put the dressing on the burger. We have never been shorted on the bottomless fries, whatever flavor we get (usually garlic), at other Red Robin's we have gotten second orders, in Woburn, always more than we can eat. Maybe it's not how friendly the server is, but, how friendly we are. They have been bringing small baskets of different kinds of fries out as free apps lately.  If it is those that you think are small, well, they are free. Sort of, see how you like it. Like any establishment there are some great servers, some good servers, & a couple who would be better off in another kind of job. It is kinda expensive. But, it is so above all the other burger places around that it is our go to place for a nice burger dinner, to relax, not hurry.

The managers were also very accommodating, removing items from the bill and offering free deserts.  I explained that I just wish they could produce what was ordered. The location is new so I will try again in a few months.  If Red Robin reads this review, please, please have someone verify orders are prepared correctly.

25,Susan S.,"Arlington, MA",205,162,298.0,2.0,2017-05-28,"Earlier this week, as I looked forward to Memorial Day weekend, I pictured myself trying out a new restaurant, perhaps with a patio bar and lobster. However, I left lunch choice to a friend and ended up at Red Robin. I typically do not review chains, but this place was disappointing so here I am to keep Corporate America on its toes.  To make matters worse, this chain's specialty, burgers, was certainly not what I was craving today. So, I dug myself an even deeper hole and ordered a salad. Disclosure: I have eaten at another Red Robin location in the past and did try a burger. It was decent, but didn't wow me enough to come back to an RR until today, a whole two years later and not by choice. I could sum this whole experience up with one phrase ""It is what it is,"" but you all know my reviews never take shortcuts.  The ""Avo-Cobb-O"" looked to be the most promising. I mean, bleu cheese and bacon can hide just about anything right? Well, not gritty lettuce. I'm not positive of its source, but there was definitely a gritty, sandy texture I kept sensing and I believe it was from the lettuce. This salad has so much potential, but was a big disappointment. Lots of great ingredients, but they don't come together quite right. Also, I'm taking off a half star for making me say that silly name while ordering.  The menu is typical chain fare. There is a selection of burgers, sandwiches, wraps- probably your best bet. Entrees include chicken, steak, and salmon dishes. I hesitate to order such entrees at a restaurant like this because I know they will be hit or miss. The menu also offers some fun non-alcoholic beverages and there is a full bar as well. Starters include soup, chili, and a few pub style appetizers. There is a kid's menu and desserts. We ordered some guac, salsa and chips to start, but the portion was very small and disappointing. Something for everyone here at Red Robin, but to me it's all just glorified fast food.  The atmosphere is bright and trendy. There is a large bar area on one side and TV's in both the bar and dining room. I think being able to watch the Sox game was the highlight of today's visit. I thought our table for two was very small. I strategically moved plates and cups to make room for the appetizer.  I liked our server, Janet. She was very friendly and attentive. Janet brought me a couple different salad dressings to try, which I thought was a nice gesture. She also told me she liked my shoes - winning!  My friend and I have different tastes/standards in food and that's okay. Sometimes a quick burger may be just what you're looking for, but I think there are so many better choices in the area. I'm still dreaming of that patio bar and lobster.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woburn,1.96,1.96,1.96,1.6720000000000002,1.96

We were surrounded by dirty dishes on empty tables, chairs tipped on their backs, and dirty napkins strewn about the floor. For the entirety of our meal.  Our waitress was as attentive as she could be; but was obviously over-extended. Bussing tables, refilling drinks, taking orders and delivering food to basically the entire dinning room is too much for one person to handle.  The overall experience wasn't great. Staff was stretched too thin to even make it feel like a clean environment; let alone getting adequate service.

I got a burger with a fried egg and American cheese. The burger had bits of bone and gristle in it, which was very unpleasant. I asked for the burger well-done and I got it medium. The burger and the egg were way over-salted and that saltiness overpowered any flavor from the beef or the egg. It really was terrible. The American cheese was a ""cheese product"" that they use because it gets melty fast but again, is oversalty. It reminded me of the cheese at McDonald's. I was looking forward to the unlimited fries, but alas, another disappointment. They are just frozen steak fries that they dole out in tiny portions, though they are unlimited. The first batch I got was warm, not hot and OK for the frozen potato genre. For the money and the hype, I expected much, much better. They need a better quality burger that won't kill you with bones and gristle, and fresh potato steak fries, not frozen Then they could justify charging $12 for a burger.

This is my third time here with my family and I have to say, the service sucks and the burgers are average. The place has been going downhill. The service has not improved at all. We walk into the place and we wait there for 10 minutes before being seated, every time we are here. While waiting, the place has a ton of empty tables and we wonder why we have to wait. That question was answered;  we had to wait for 10 minutes at the door because the waiter/host had to clean off the tables so he could seat us. That's just ridiculous!!! All the tables are dirty and piled high with plates. The floor is also covered with dirty napkins.  It makes me wonder what the waiter/ host was doing at the door when we walked in (nothing).  As we wait another 10 minutes at the table deciding what to order, we look around and see other customers giving looks to each other. The looks are for the server and the place because the kitchen managed to mess up their order. I saw this at every table around me. My question is, what are the cooks doing back there? Mind you, as we wait a little longer, we were deciding whether or not we should leave too.  When the food finally came out, they managed to mess my burger up. My mom and I ordered the same burger and hers was made correctly, but it was missing the tortilla chips. I ate like half the burger to realize that I was missing a lot of stuff, way different than my mom's burger. My burger was missing the tortilla chips, the salsa, and the guacamole on the top bun. My thought is, how could they possibly make the sandwich wrong?! With the long wait, and the wrong order, it is not worth it to return to this place for the price we pay.  For a ""gourmet"" burger joint, the burgers are over priced and are average. I don't think I would come again if it wasn't for our free gourmet birthday burgers.

The burger selection is extensive and the one I had (Burning Love) was delicious. Fries were good too and my wife liked her bleu cheeseburger. The place - on a Saturday night - was quite lively with a lot of families with kids. The service was ok, if slow. Our server was nice but came back about 10 minutes after we ordered to double-check what we wanted. I thought that was odd. She also asked us if we wanted more French Fries long after we were done eating. It also took her a while to come back and pick up the check. Fortunately, we weren't in any particular hurry. That's the good news. Now, I posted a couple of pictures which I hope come through. But let me say this: this is the dirtiest restaurant I've ever eaten in. I'm a businessman and I travel and eat in a lot of restaurants. I've seen cleaner Chuck E. Cheeses.  Right next to me on the floor the whole time we were there was a pile of popcorn and, maybe, french fries. Likewise there was a similar pile across from me next to a table. There WAS a manager there. He came out (once) to help push tables together, completely overlooking the receipt on the floor and the pile of popcorn and french fry right next to him. I realize the place was busy but that's no excuse for him not to send someone out with a broom. (Or do it himself.) No excuses. This guy's not competent to be a restaurant manager.
