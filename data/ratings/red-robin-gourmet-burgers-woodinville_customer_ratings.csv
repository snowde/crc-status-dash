151,Howard S.,"Snohomish, WA",0,1,,5.0,2012-03-05,This restaurant is consistently great & the service is top notch.  We were there on a busy Friday night.  The wait staff was constantly checking with us to apologize for our food being slow when it was understandable the kitchen was inundated with orders.  The manager gave us a free appetizer while we waited. At this restaurant customer service is a priority.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=140,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005
111,JoAnn A.,"Bellevue, WA",80,319,32.0,3.0,2012-03-07,"I've been here twice over the last six months. The one thing I certainly don't like about this place (and it probably goes for all locations I'm guessing) is they told us they don't take reservations. So for the first time I came here, we had a party of maybe 8-9, and since reservations weren't allowed, we had to wait a very long time to be seated because I guess whoever had a large party was just sitting there. I get it, after you eat and pay you wanna talk a little more, that's fine, I've done it before too. I think if a reservation option was available, we wouldn't have had to wait as long because we'd already have seats for us, instead of having to stand around hungry for longer than we expected. The more recent time I came here, the wait for a table of about the same size was about ten minutes or less!  I don't have any problems with the servers here (both times they've been just fine) and the food here is fine (not my favorite, but there's decent stuff here) I was just very turned off with the no reservations thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=100,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.8280000000000003,3.0400000000000005
142,Jordan W.,"Woodinville, WA",260,5,,3.0,2012-03-29,"Pros:  The food is good, there a a lot of different burgers and things to pick, plus bottomless french fries.  The drinks are also yummy.  It is worth the money you pay, plus if it is your birthday you get free ice cream. The customer service is pretty good, although it is a bit slow because of how crowded it is, they will bring you free fries if you ask.  Cons:  It is LOUD.  There are a lot of kids, birthdays, and long lines if you go at the wrong time.   A good place to go every once and awhile for a nice meal, as long as you don't mind the crowds and the wait.  Not the best place for a date night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=140,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.8600000000000003,3.0000000000000004
138,Jeff B.,"Seattle, WA",67,182,2.0,3.0,2012-04-03,Enjoyed a very decent burger here recently and my friends chicken sandwich was rated as average by him. Maybe my expectations were set to high for maybe I was thinking there were going to be some new exciting menu items but it was rather predictable. Don't get me wrong it was a good burger just wasn't one that would make me drive out of my way too far to try again.

145,Wampa C.,"Woodinville, WA",0,55,,3.0,2012-08-08,"We go to this Red Robin weekly and sometimes multiple times a week.  Although it is the worst Red Robin we go to - it is the most convenient one near our house.  They mess up our food about 25% of the time we go here - it always seems to be a problem with the cooks/kitchen.  Once I ordered a BBQ chicken wrap - after the first bite I knew something was different but didn't figure it out until I was halfway done - IT DIDNT HAVE ANY BBQ SAUCE IN IT!  Seems odd to leave out the BBQ Sauce in a BBQ Chicken Wrap.  I told the waitress who just said ""oh I will go get you some""  she arrived with a small cup of the barbecue sauce that I had to disassemble the wrap and apply myself - we didn't get any credit for the meal.  This is only one of the typical things that go wrong.  Since we go here enough we know that we should never order a cocktail unless we see a Bartender on duty - leaving this up to the general servers will always result in a bad drink.   Always make sure they give you napkins before you bit into your juicy burger and have it dripping down your hand - about half the time they forget to give us napkins or utensils with salads.  We have found that in the past 6 months they have some new staff that really make a difference.   The guy running the bar most days makes great drinks and is fun to talk to.  They have some servers too that seem to be more friendly and knowledgeable than the ones in the past.  They also extended the bar area (which in the past only included 2 person tables - which was horrible for happy hour if you had a group of more than 2) - now the bar booths can accommodate groups up to 6.  I am happy to see the Woodinville Red Robin improving and hope it continues into the kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=140,2.8,2.8,2.8,3.0840000000000005,2.8

We got the best waiter we've ever had (named Jordan) and he's worked there since 2006.  He was very good and not as pushy as other servers. my food was very good. My burger wasn't piping hot, but that's the way i like it. the fries seemed underseasoned, but that's why they have the seasoned salt and ketchup on the tables the bottomless steak fries are one of the main reasons i love red robin so much. Most restaurants charge you for fries, and they aren't bottomless.

Great place to go for a burger and fries and a pint. It's a chain so you're going to get the cheesy decor, big menus, and foo foo drinks, but if you can get over that, the food is pretty good and the prices aren't terrible. We try to go during happy hour and grab a table in the bar. It's not a great happy hour but at least you can save a couple of bucks on your beer.

72,Rebecca F.,"Cary, NC",64,468,347.0,3.0,2012-11-03,"Obviously a chain restaurant and you pretty much get what you expect here. It's worthy of a review only because of the customer service here -- which is surprisingly.... tolerant!  I was really surprised at just how crowded this location was when we stepped in (our original lunch option was closed and this was our back-up option). Perhaps because so many other places nearby are a bit more pricey (thinking of Big Fish Grill, Teddy's Bigger Burgers, etc.) more people flock to RR. Whatever the reason, it definitely was crowded with a wait at the door and a rather packed restaurant! Our dining experience was as expected with no problems or issues. The staff seemed very friendly despite dealing with various issues that were popping up around us though. At a nearby table one customer was just complaining constantly and management came to discuss the problem with them and they were so patient and even able to maintain their composure for something that seemed rather trivial to us at our table. The customer with the complaint wouldn't calm down, but the staff at RR handled it beautifully. This RR definitely does a good job with their staff from the greeters to waiters all the way up to their management. They also stay true to what is expected of the RR experience. Well done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=60,3.16,3.16,3.16,3.0840000000000005,3.1600000000000006

Last visit here 12/31 was typically good, our server kept drinks filled and checked in often enough. Value: Prices here are a little higher than I would like.  You're usually looking at $15-20/person.

137,Brianna F.,"Woodinville, WA",0,3,,1.0,2013-01-19,"I've been going to Red Robins since I was a little girl! Therefore I have been to many different Red Robin franchises. I moved to Woodinville less than two years ago, so this became the Red Robin of choice if we ever wanted Red Robin. It is probably the dirtiest Red Robin I have ever been in. The floors and the molding along the floor and the wall has quite the buildup of dirt. Gross. I always have to wipe my booth off before siting down unless I want to sit on the person's food from before me.  Other than this, the food was always the same as the other Red Robins, which is a good thing. Until.....I ordered my 10month old a side of their mandarin oranges (like .90 cents) and as I am feeding her, there is cheddar cheese mixed throughout the oranges. Sick. Obviously I flagged the waitress down and told her. She asked us if she could get us more and I said no thanks and she was about to walk away with out even removing the dish from our table. I actually had to say wait and hand it to her. Then she shows up a bit later with a new dish of oranges...even though we said no. Whatever. We get the bill and needless to say the oranges are still on the bill. I know its just .90 cents but come one, it's the principle of the matter! I asked her to remove it from our bill and she yelled across the room to the manager to ask him to take it off. Terrible service.  The very next time we come back, maybe about a month later, I order a diet coke and after drinking about half of it there is something in my glass!! I fish it out with my straw and it is a DIRTY STRING. Wow. Asked for the manager and her exact words were ""I am sorry, there is not much more I can do than say I am sorry."" Are you kidding me!? My husband and I just stared at each other like wtf. How about comp our bill? Or maybe, just maybe, take the diet coke off.... I worked as a host, server and manager in the restaurant business when I was younger. I know good service and good management. This place has neither...not even a good bus boy. (Can't wipe down the seat?)

122,Jeff M.,"Snohomish, WA",0,68,6.0,1.0,2013-03-29,"Last night dinner @ Red Robin Woodinville...  YUCK!  Cold Soggy Fish sandwich and cold fries!!! My wife and I went out for a fish sandwich, salad, and onion rings...  Here's the chronology... NCAA tournament is on, time was around 8 PM.  Restaurant was fairly busy, but we were seated right away.   Server apologized for the delay (he was busy) - we understood :) Ordered drinks and our Onion rings and asked for them to be served first before our meal.  At the same time we also ordered a fish sandwich, salad, and fries.  We asked for the fish sandwich order to be put in after the o-rings so we could enjoy a hot meal. The o-rings came out cold, we requested replacement.  The server took them back and the ""manager"" stopped by and apologized and gave us replacement rings.  Hot this time - they also removed them from our bill.  That was nice. 10 minutes later our fish sandwich arrived with fries and a side salad.  The fish was COLD and soggy, the fries were cold...  They were delivered by another server.  We asked for refills on our water...  No water refills came... After already raising a concern about the cold onion rings...  We looked and the manager was busy talking with his staff in the bar and in the back.  He was nowhere in sight to greet customers, or to follow-up. Disappointed...  We ended up eating a cold soggy fish sandwich with cold fries with a salad.  Several minutes later our server stopped by - we again asked for waters, he did return with refills.  Clearly he was ""busy"", but that is expected at RR...  It did not seem like he was any busier than a typical evening at RR.

We came in on Easter Sunday while running an errand in Woodinville. First off, props to all the suckers who either volunteered for working or didn't get a choice. It was a gorgeous day, like the first 70 degree day of the year, so everybody wanted to sit outside. (and by everybody means like 10 tables.. it wasn't crowded, but crowded enough that it was a lot of tables for one person). Ashley seriously stepped it up. She was bubbly, friendly, very attentive and super nice. She was on top of her game, especially for it being hot out and she was the only one out there. I'm pretty sure she also mentioned she was preggo. She brought out fries for us to snack on before our burgers without us even having to ask. She constantly refilled our beverages. When I told her I had an allergy she made extra notes to have them cook it on a separate surface! I didn't even know RR did that. Nobody else has ever offered that when I say I'm extremely allergic to gluten..My order came out wrong and she noticed before she even sat it on the table.

55,Lee A.,"Kirkland, WA",84,71,81.0,4.0,2015-08-21,"The thing about Red Robin is that you know what you're going to get. Or at least you know what to expect. You can expect a great selection of delicious burgers and and ever-changing menu as they try to keep the options exciting and bring new tastes to us. So really, it comes down to the service which makes or breaks each location. Overall we had a good experience at this location. There were 5 adults and 3 kids - all under 5. We were seated with ample room for all of us (kids require bringing so much 'stuff' along with you) and everyone, including our server, was friendly and helpful. The one complaint I have is that our server mostly sensitive the fact that we had kids. She brought us the crayons and stuff for them and even took their orders first (good to get in right away). However there was a lag between when she took their orders and then came back for ours, which means the kids get and finish their meals well before the adults are remotely done. It ended up working out OK as we continued to stuff our kids full of fries while we finished our meals (kind kidding) but would be something to bring up in training about how to best meet the needs of families with young kids.

37,Kelly P.,"Kirkland, WA",70,12,,1.0,2015-10-11,"This used to be a fun place for our family to come, but it has changed, and not in a good way.  This was our go-to place to take the kids for a fun treat. They would beg to go. We were fine with that since we could grab a beer and alter the food to fit our preferences. The serving staff was typically attentive and gracious, and would engage with the boys. The server we had yesterday was lovely and did nothing that contributed to our poor experience. She was great. It was the overall atmosphere that really sealed the determination that we will not be back.  Three of our four orders came to us wrong. My older son noticed that his chicken strips were smaller than they used to be and there were only 2 rather than the 3 pictured in his menu. My younger son ordered a corn dog, as he always does; rather than 1 regular sized corn dog, he got a number of what seemed to be Vienna sausages dipped in corn batter, eww! My husband ordered the royal red robin burger with an extra patty, extra pickles, and no bun; the egg looked scorched and there were hardly any pickles. I ordered my guacamole bacon burger lettuce wrapped, and it arrived with no bun or wrap; no big deal there, but annoying.  They also seem to be slowly lessoning the wait staff, as each table now has a ridiculous screen for ordering appetizers, reordering drinks, and playing games and such. You also use it to pay your bill. It added a cold air of detachment to the experience, as if they can no longer be bothered to check on tables as frequently as before, although our server did make us a priority.  After the meal, we let the boys spend a few quarters in the game area, which was sad. The machines are obviously not being replenished, and I'm sure will be removed at some point in the near future, as Red Robin is moving toward an atmosphere of the sports bar and grill (of which there are already plenty and better establishments). When we got to the car, we realized our little guy had left his play glasses in the both, so I went back in for them. The hostess made a show to find them, but came back saying they weren't there. I had to tell 2 other people about them before they were finally found by someone who could be bothered to actually look.  Don't bother patronizing this or any Red Robin. There are better places for a burger; in Woodinville there are much better places for a beer, and families should definitely pass, as they obviously no longer want kids here (which I find silly as kids are future patrons themselves).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=20,2.56,2.56,2.56,1.7960000000000003,2.56

We were seated (by default without asking) in the packed bar @ 11am, even with the main restaurant nearly empty (but we went along with it anyways), and I forgot I hate the bar area because the tables reek of mildew. Luckily our table also had a great view of the server/drink station's cabinet door hanging ajar by only 1 hinge. Our server immediately didn't believe my wife was deserving of her birthday month free burger (via their rewards program), even though she brought a printout, and he wouldn't honor it until she produced either her email address or cell-phone number to look her up. My 'Terminator Genisys' burger was supposed to include jalapeño aioli, roasted jalapeños, Pepper Jack cheese, bacon, tomatoes, romaine lettuce & avocado ... and it arrived sans bacon, lettuce, or tomato. I pointed this out to the server, and 5 minutes later, he arrived with a small plate with my missing bacon, lettuce, and tomato ... gee thanks. My wife's fish sandwich arrived frozen in the middle with the breading falling off, and her fries were cold. We sent it back, and it returned freshly microwaved to room temperature. Despite all these problems with both service & the food, no portion was comped except the birthday sandwich, nor was the server apologetic for this mediocre meal. Thanks to the Woodinville location, I strongly doubt I'll choose Red Robin over most fast food, especially the restaurants that put an emphasis on service over corporate banality. P.S. Yes, we did submit this feedback to   right after our visit, and got a response back 3 weeks later, saying my rewards account has been credited enough to earn me a free burger, though the free burger expired within 60 days of that email.

That is until tonight. We went to my friends daughters jr. High play and as a group of seven decided to grab a bite to eat after. We had four adults and three kids. We put our name in at the front and asked how long the wait was. We were told ten to fifteen min, okay no problem. We waited about ten min and then I asked the host if it would be faster if we separated into two different groups. He told me yes they could seat us faster that way and took us back to two open booths. The kids (13,12, and 7) at one table and the adults at another.   After waiting a few minutes the host then came back and informed us he was going to grab our drink order because our server was busy, we were more than okay with that.  He then returned about ten min later without our drinks and said our server was still too busy to see us so he was also going to take our food orders, okay still totally cool with us. At this point we had already been at the restaurant about 45min and we're getting hungry. We asked if the host could grab us some frys to tide us over till our food was ready, he said no prob... We finally got our drinks and then everyone disappeared. We spotted the host off in the back with his shirt untucked so I can only assume at that point he must have ended his shift. We were left with no frys, no food and no server... We waited for probably another fifteen minutes with no word from anyone when I decided to ask to speak with a manager.  At this point the manager came up and copped a huge attitude with me. When I told him we had no server he told me they were busy and should have just left our party in the waiting area... I took that as extremely rude and unnecessary especially because we were being very understanding and at no point ever demanded to be sat! He was defensive and very pissy. I have worked in a number of restaurants in my day and I can tell you that is not the kind of attitude I expect in a manager. Especially when I was not rude or demanding in the slightest bit.   After our conversation the manager brought some frys to our table and must have told a server to come see us because then she showed up. She was very nice and I feel bad saying anything at all because I am not one to normally complain but the way our party was handled was very crappy.

Tables are always clean, and the staff acknowledges you super quickly. Shoutout to Chris in the bar for being an awesome, attentive server and for being hilarious. They have Angry Orchard on draft, which is awesome because I can get a giant one to wash down my clucks and fries with (yup, still ordering the same thing since I was 12). Husband's margaritas were strong and still tasty. Our food came out quickly, was hot, and had a good amount of fries to go with. This pretty much covers everything you want/need out of a Red Robin.

I came in a half hour after they opened to meet my grandma for her birthday lunch. Our waitress Kourtney blew us off the entire time, helping the only other table in the restaurant and speeding past our table. She didn't write down our order, which I dont mind, but my grandmas order was wrong and she didnt bring any of the extra things we asked for- dipping sauce, more fries, coffee refill, ect. We had to ask a different waiter, John, to help us since she wouldn't come to check in on us at all. The fries were cold, my salad was wack, wrong order for the bday girl, cold coffee. Plus I paid basically $10 for a tiny plate of lettuce (no croutons or cheese on my salad for some reason) and a cup of coffee.

Bottomless fries is always awesome.  Price is great.  SERVICE SUCKS!!! Staff at this location is not the most helpful. You ask to sit in a certain empty booth and they say no. Its silly. If you are coming with a fussy baby you want to sit as far away from other guests so you don't disturb them.  Next visit again there is practically an empty restaurant but the hostess wants to seat us at the booth directly next to an occupied booth. Its like getting on an empty airplane and the flight attendant demanding you sit in the middle seat between 2 people when the rest of the plane is empty. Really where is the common sense. Management is not focusing on customer service here.  Another time the hostess did not greet us. We did not seat ourselves so we waited patiently not saying anything to see if she would acknowledge us. It got to the point it was a joke between my husband and a game to see how long she would ignore us and keep walking by before saying hello or realizing we wanted a seat. She saw us walk in. She looked up from her booth. She grabbed menus and arranged them in the stack. She walked past my husband and I 4 times as we stood in the lobby. It was not until she walked past us again to wipe down windows with windex that my husband finally spoke up. 14 minutes. She tried to seat us in the bar and we said we don't feel comfortable there we don't drink and she rolled her eyes as she led us to a table in the restaurant.  Only reason we did not leave was it was the only place still open with hamburgers after 9pm. And we were killing time before going to the movies.  Customer service is horrible but the food is fairly inexpensive and they are open late so that is the only reason why we go. We will consciously make an effort to never return and instead use that Hawaiian themed burger joint in town but they close at 9:30.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=20,2.28,2.82,2.82,2.216,2.604
54,Michael M.,"Woodinville, WA",0,2,,1.0,2016-07-17,"I know I already reviewed this place before... but... I feel I would be remiss if I did not share a certain-- *cough* shall we say-- ""experience"" I had there recently... It all started when I was trying to find a restaurant that was accommodating with regards to dairy allergies. Some places did alright, while other failed miserably. When I went to Red Robin, I was CERTAIN they would pass with flying colors... BOY was I in for a surprise... For my order, I asked for a Burnin' Love Burger with mayo on the side, and cucumber slices with the non-dairy breading used for the onion rings. The waiter confidently took my order... then, as he was walking away, I tugged on his sleeve. ""By the way,"" I said nonchalantly as he turned to look at me, ""I'll need you to file an allergy alert for dairy along with my order."" (Should be simple enough), I thought to myself, scratching my chin. (After all, Red Robin's allergy alert system is ingenious. I've ordered burgers without cheese from them before, so why should this challenge be any different?) All that was left was to steeple my fingers and wait. The ball was in the Robin's court. Some time later, my meal arrived. As the waiter turned to leave, I tugged his sleeve again to stop him. ""A test,"" I said, holding up my finger. He watched, frowning as I lifted the bun off the burger. So far, so good... I deftly flipped through the lettuce, jalapeno rings, tomatoes, and the patty... no cheese on either side of any of them. The mayo was in a little cup to the side, just as I had asked-- a perfect solution had I been allergic to eggs, and had I been accompanied by someone else who wanted extra mayo. I cracked my knuckles-- time to step it up a notch. The waiter began to speak, but I shushed him. I would NOT be distracted. Lifting a cucumber stick to my lips slowly, I ran it from side to side, tasting the breading carefully for any trace of dairy. ""It's clean,"" I announced with a sigh of relief. ""That is all, waiter. You may go."" As he slowly turned to walk away, I grabbed his sleeve again. ""Wait!"" I said, grabbing the burger. ""There's something I forgot!"" ""I examined its insides thoroughly for any sign of cheese, and found not a trace. However, what of the bun?"" I slowly traced my fingertip across the top of the bun, and confirmed my suspicion, I slowly lifted the bun to my mouth and licked it carefully, gathering evidence of the restaurant's mistake. ""Butter!"" I shouted. ""You put butter on the buns, thinking I wouldn't notice, thinking that my allergies would flare up sometime later, and that I would blame them on something else! Well, you won't get a fast one past me... not only did your little trap fail my test, but I'm not even allergic to dairy! CHECKMATE!"" This rather disillusioning experience was dragged out a while longer, but I won't bore you with the details. Suffice it to say, avoid the Robin if you have a severe dairy allergy. They might have a handle on the basics of allergy alerts, but they're a far cry from going pro...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=40,2.28,2.8,2.8,2.148,2.592

I don't fault him whatsoever, it was an accident and we all understand it happens! The thing that upset me was when he came out with napkins, the manager followed him out. While he helped us clean up, she stood far back just watching the entire thing. When the waiter left and I turned around to look at her, she immediately went to the table behind us and asked how they were doing. She did not once come over to our table to see if everything was okay after that, and pretty much wrote us off. Just because we're younger and didn't freak out on the waiter, doesn't mean you shouldn't check in on us. It was rude to be ignored and to check on the table behind us instead! Female, blond manager if that helps narrow it down. Of course I never got her name since she never even came up to us...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=20,2.56,2.67,2.67,,2.6260000000000003
13,Jennifer K.,"Bothell, WA",52,58,44.0,3.0,2017-08-20,"We have been coming to this location for 6 years. It has always been hit or miss. You either get a 5* experience or a 1* experience, hence the 3* rating. I think the food is ok, but my kids love this place and will both sit there with perfect behavior and eat every bite so I will keep coming back. Tonight, they ""ran out of ice"" which is why we couldn't get drink refills...this was resolved at the end of our meal but everyone was quite thirsty given the salty food and 80+ degree temp. If you plan to frequent RR you should sign up for the loyalty program, it is something like buy 10 burgers get 1 free. With the typical wait to be seated, I finally read their sign with the origin story and had no idea RR was founded in Seattle in the U dist originally as Sam's Red Robin (named after some college quartet), which I thought was interesting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville,2.64,2.66,2.66,,2.652
9,Joshua S.,"Seattle, WA",3,8,6.0,1.0,2017-10-07,Was told 15min for takeout... 35 min later with just an excuse that the kitchen got busy. Not a Way to run a business. If they told me an hour wait time I would have been fine with that. Don't say one time and have it be much longer after I'm already at the restaurant waiting for my food,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville,2.56,2.63,2.63,,2.6020000000000003
2,Jimmy B.,"Bellevue, WA",19,312,125.0,1.0,2017-11-05,"11/5.  New Update... After watching three other tables get served food that were seated after us AFTER we placed our order, WE WALKED OUT.    I won't be back.    Update:   Better service, probably due to a very attentive bartender.  Food was just ""okay"" again, with fries being undercooked.     I had stopped going to Red Robin for a months because of poor overall experience at many locations, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOUTH CENTER (awesome through and through).   Not sure why, but the new lie seems to be the norm.    I did receive a request from customer service on my last review here requesting my contact info to ""discuss my experience"" but never heard back.  I guess I'll just write off all the locations except South Center, and treat Red Robin as a single location restaurant.   Oh well",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville,2.44,2.6,2.6,,2.536
1,Michelle B.,"Enumclaw, WA",14,113,231.0,1.0,2017-11-06,"Not a great experience last night at the Woodinville Red Robin.  We arrived and went into the bar.  It was busy but there were a few open seats here and there.  We didn't order anything elaborate or crazy.  2 waters,  a cup of french onion soup and a BLTA Croissant.  Not sure what happened but the three different parties that came in after us all got served their food before us.  We had ordered at about 612 pm and decided to leave 35 minutes later after the 3rd party got their food delivered and we still didn't have ours. Our water got refilled but never saw our food.   I think the bartender meant well,  especially when he dropped off a basket of fries to the 2nd party who arrived and ordered after us. He dropped the basket and said something to the effect,  ""Here's some  fries while you wait for your order.""  Oh, I almost forgot...  the couple who sat there prior to this 2nd couple had to point out to the bartender that we were waiting to be acknowledged  and wanted to order.  The bartender cane over and took our order. That couple left, the table got cleaned and the 2nd party came in and sat down.   It appears our order got lost and the bartender didn't even realize it because there was never any apology, obligatory basket of fries or explanation as to why it was taking so long. I don't mind the wait if it's busy and we all are waiting,  but when the 3rd party after us gets their food before us there is clearly an issue.  Oh, and the BLTA I ordered was given to one of the other three parties. Bummer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville,2.36,2.56,2.56,,2.48
11,Ben K.,"Snohomish, WA",0,1,,1.0,2017-11-26,I've been here three times in the last 6 months at different times of the day and each time it is at least a 20 minute wait to be seated.  I would understand if the dining area is full but each time it's only half full.  I think this Woodinville location needs to hire more people.  Also I would rather sit at a table and wait longer for service than stand in an small overcrowded waiting room.  This long wait has irritated me and given me enough time to write this review.  I suggest going to other locations.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville,2.32,2.52,2.52,,2.44
4,David A.,"Lynnwood, WA",48,22,6.0,4.0,2017-12-04,Just as you would expect from a Red Robin. We didn't have to wait long at all and the staff was very nice. The Bacon Guacamole Burger was very good and as expected. My sons loved their milkshakes too. The beer was cold and fast. Overall nice time. PS - I really like the screens they have on the table to pay. Super easy,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville,2.36,2.51,2.51,,2.45
0,Paul F.,"Redmond, WA",54,3,1.0,4.0,2018-01-03,"Tonight I took my kids to the Red Robin in Woodinville.  We frequent other Red Robin restaurants.  My son is a lover of fries and most of the time it's a challenge to get even two baskets during a meal. The Woodinville Red Robin has been consistently good at keeping him topped off with fries.  While the burgers are pretty great, I typically order the grilled chicken salad.  The chicken is always tender and everything is fresh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville,2.48,2.51,2.51,,2.498
