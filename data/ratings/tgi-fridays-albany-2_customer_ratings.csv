8,Katelynn M.,"Altamont, NY",0,10,,2.0,2012-05-10,"Fridays makes great drinks.  If you want a nice alcoholic lemonade on a summer's day, Fridays is a great place to do that.  However, I am a vegetarian and places like Fridays get very confused when people ask for a bean patty instead of a beef patty.  This is part of their menu, but when it is requested I might as well be asking for dung because they question your selection.  I went there for my brother's birthday and I received a turkey burger instead of my bean patty and my boyfriend (also a vegetarian) asked for a pasta dish without the chicken or shrimp.  He received the dish without the shrimp but still had chicken on it.  Needless to say, we ate after everyone else did.  The bean patty was good, though...when I finally received it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albany-2?start=20,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088
32,Michelle B.,"Albany, NY",139,281,721.0,3.0,2012-11-30,"I guess it's time to upgrade Friday's to ""A-OK"".  Yes, the food is hit-or-miss (usually miss), and the atmosphere is like any other chain.  But the bar service and bartenders are a solid 4 stars.  I've come in more frequently since I started working nearby, and usually sit at the bar whether I come for lunch or happy hour.  With the recent push for health food in restaurants, Friday's has added some less fatty and lower calorie options to the menu, which is appreciated.  They have some good salads which are hard to screw up, as well as some tasty appetizers.  The drinks are not cheap, but they are large and delish.   So while it's a good spot for a drink, lunch, and friendly bartenders, I still opt for other places when it comes to dinner / table service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albany-2,,,,,
6,Bruce W.,"Oneonta, NY",2,33,38.0,5.0,2013-08-02,"Appetizer 3 trio loaded potato skins,  beer pretzel's, pot stickers. Meal one jack Daniels top sirloin with ribs medium with Jasmin rice pilaf and seasoned fries. Meal two jack Daniels 10 oz with shrimp scampi, parm steak fries,  Jasmin rice pilaf.  Ice water and lemonaid. Was good food like most of the chain ones I have been to. The binghamton one comparably was a bit better but nothing really to complain about. Always good for steak and good pasta so long as it isn't the cajun which seemed far past cajun and closer to fire. This place may be hit or miss, but on this visit it was fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albany-2?start=20,,,,,
5,John H.,"Schenectady County, NY",12,2,,2.0,2013-11-08,"Not pleased...and I'm easy to please. 1/2 hour wait prior to being seated (no biggee), friendly service, and orders taken pretty quickly. First appetizer (mozzarella sticks) came quickly, but there was hardly any cheese inside the large rectangle of fried bread. Next appetizer - which took longer than the Mozzerella sticks by about 15 minutes - French onion soup, was actually burnt. The rim and surface of the cheese was charred black. A little over 45 minutes later, the entrees came. The stacked burger was okay, but not nearly as appetizing as advertised. The sirloin was similar. The kids didn't finish their meals - another (under done) burger, and chicken tenders. The only things I'd say were tasty were the fries. This is my second trip to TGI's in ten years, and at their prices I won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albany-2?start=20,,,,,

26,Jeff S.,"Bucks County, PA",569,1716,407.0,1.0,2014-09-02,"We decided to have a quick lunch here because it was easy for some of our party to get to. I saw the Yelp reviews beforehand but was outvoted, so...what can you do? First impression? Really dirty. Flies on the window. greasy/slippery floors, filthy high chair, and a very neglected baby changing station. So right off the bat, I'm hating this place.  Service was prompt and we got our food in about 10 minutes. I went with a lunch combo that included an avocado club sandwich, fries, and a Caesar salad. The sandwich was okay, at least the filling was anyway. The avocado and bacon were fresh but the roll was spongy. The fries were tasty but lukewarm when we got them, and the salad was an uninteresting throwaway which was 95% lettuce. Someone else picked up the tab for the lunch so I don't have to regretfully feel like I wasted money on crap. But still, the entire experience of sitting and eating at TGI Friday's completely sucked. Even if I could get free meals here I would never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albany-2,,,,,

23,Nancy S.,"Cohoes, NY",188,183,79.0,1.0,2014-12-08,"Do yourself a favor and DON'T GO HERE unless you want to kill yourself with deep fried, dirty crap. I used to frequent this Fridays location as it used to be a spot that was always reliable and satisfying. My experience tonight totally changed that and I will never be back.  The meal started off promising, my sister and I ordered drinks and an appetizer, and that was fine. My sister then ordered the Jack Daniels chicken sandwich, and I ordered what I always do, the Parmesan crusted chicken which is always a safe and yummy choice. First off, the entrees took forever to even come to the table, which was no fault of the servers, but once it did is when everything went downhill for me. Another server brought out our meals, and I was perplexed at what was on my plate. The piece of chicken I got was probably 3 inches big, and was dark brown, almost looked like a baked potato rather than a moist piece of chicken. This chicken is typically coated in a marinade and coated in a parmesan ""crust"" as the name would suggest. This chicken was overcooked to the point that my fork couldn't puncture it without extreme pressure. The only parmesan on the chicken was a few sprinkles on the top of the chicken. I'm not usually one to complain, but I couldn't fathom actually paying to eat something that looked so pathetic. I brought my concerns to our servers attention, and he graciously took the dish back to the kitchen.  Shortly after, the manager came over to the table and asked ""so you didn't like your meal"". I was actually really annoyed that this was even a question. Had she actually looked at the dish, she should have noticed that serving something that looked so awful should be unacceptable. She asked if I wanted the same dish, and I said yes if it would be better. She couldn't make any promises. Right... Meanwhile, my sister has completely finished her meal, and about 20 minutes later, a new one comes for me. The chicken is somewhat better, but nothing to rave about. Acceptable. While I was eating, I also noticed how completely filthy the glass that my soda was in was. To the point where I think I may have gotten a dirty dish.  We received the bill, and I noticed that the disgusting meal was not removed. I was not going to make an ordeal out of it, since I wasn't looking for a handout. But, I just know I will never go back to Fridays again. At least not that location. The quality of the food and the ambiance is not worth it at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albany-2,,,,,
30,Isabella S.,"Brooklyn, NY",73,250,15.0,1.0,2014-12-24,"This place is disgusting. It's a shame because I have frequented this location over the years many times and was always satisfied. Now, the place is a mess, the food is disgusting, the silverware is dirty and the management is terrible. The past few times I've been here, my food has been sub par, dry, tasteless and over priced. I dont know what theyre trying to do with their menu but its too expensive for some basic chain restaurant. Example; ""sizzling chicken and cheese"" costs 13-14 dollars. Why do two 3 inch chicken breasts, peppers, onions, mashed potatoes and a piece of american cheese thrown on top cost that much? I ordered this one time recently and had it sent back because it wasnt ""sizzling"" it was cold, and the cheese (which i found out is literally just a slice of american cheese thrown on top) wasnt even melted. i had chunks of warm cheese and the corners of the unmelted slice all over the plate. Dont waste your money ordering an alcoholic drink here either. 12 dollars for a drink that has maybe one shot of alcohol in it and the rest is juice. Id rather go to a local bar and get 3 drinks for that price. Even if the food was free I wouldn't come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albany-2,,,,,

28,Katie M.,"Cohoes, NY",1,10,,2.0,2015-10-11,Have s tendency to frequent this place more than I like. Went for dinner with 4 other people. Food is what's expected typically only ever get a burger or chicken fingers. Apps are ok.  This outing I opted not to get a $12 drink that is basically grocery store mix and I hate that drinks aren't labeled with price too. Service wasn't awful but not great. I had to flag down waiter for a soda refill. After he'd been to table and my glass was empty. Also one in our party ordered endless apps and he was not so on top of that either.  The issue with this particular visit is people were leaving because there was so many empty tables but not being sat. My friend heard the host say that they couldn't sit people because didn't have staff to service tables. Umm that's not okay especially on a Saturday. You should staff your restaurant to accommodate the amount of tables you have. Luckily our wait was short because we met some friends who were extra early. There was at least 20 parties waiting to be seated. Unfortunately I'm sure I'll be back but it's never my choice to go there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albany-2,,,,,

The biggest missed factor of our experience was the service.

22,Kalinda T.,"Albany, NY",7,59,102.0,2.0,2017-02-25,"Last night (Friday) it was very busy which I expected. Seating was quick, however my husband and I was seated at a large round table which were unable to be social. We requested to be moved and we were to a more intimate seating setting. We both ordered the endless apps. Be AWARE theres a fine print... Yes you may order different apps but the first one you order is full and the rest are half size and they have to be ordered in 20 min increments according to our waiter. Don't try the fried pickles they are slimy and yucky. Our waiter tried his best to be attentive but he was definitely  having a bad evening. People behind us was cussing him out. Which resulted him forgetting about is it took 25 mins to get drinks and I'm unsure if mine had liquor in it which I did order the Long Island ice tea. If you decide to go to Fridays perhaps try Monday - Thursday. I was a bit disappointed and will never ever order endless app because I only had 1.5 orders they took long.

Our waitress was really nice. She stared us off with drinks. I got the casamigo margarita which was very good. Not too strong not too weak. I ordered the steak with mash potatoes and broccoli. The food wasn't nothing to brag about. Steak was a tad bit burnt. The mash potatoes and broccoli was really good. Overall the drinks were good the food ech lol,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albany-2,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
16,Thomas N.,"Albany, NY",110,64,19.0,4.0,2017-06-12,"I am so tired of places like TGI Friday's and other similar establishments getting a bad review. I always chalk it up as you are going to get what you are paying for, and also don't expect a fine dinning experience at a chain restaurant price. With that being said, here it goes...  Jughead and I went here on Saturday for an early dinner as we had plans later that evening. If you know anything about Jughead, you won't be surprised that this is the site (this exact location) of our first date back in 2012. Since then, we have come back a few times and have NEVER been disappointed. And honestly, for the way this place gets busy on most nights of the week, I am surprised that there are any bad reviews.  The Food: Well, we started with the Bavarian Pretzel with Beer Cheese, and was brought four ENORMOUS pretzel sticks that were pipping hot, and a delicious concoction of cheese, bacon and scallions to dip it in, how could it be bad? Well, it wasn't, actually a side was ordered to dip french fries/potatoes on later. Jughead got his usual, a cheeseburger because that boy lives on them. The waitstaff was very accommodating when he asked if there was any way possible he could switch from french fries to mashed potatoes as a side to his burger because he was in a mood for them. I went for their flat iron steak (with garlic parm butter) and half rack of BBQ ribs). Everything is always cooked to the request being made (rare for me/medium rare for Jug), and it always tastes good. The only thing I noticed was that the steamed broccoli (always good, never seems frozen) was 18000 degrees...  The Staff: We have always had the nicest servers when we go here. The only attitude that I have EVER seen was from the head hostess to her staff, and we all know that we can ALL be a little stressed at times. I believe our server on this occasion's name was Jillian, who was more than ready to help, give us an appropriate amount of time to ask how our food was from the time we received it, and was ready with refills before the glasses were even empty.  Like I said, are you going to be ordering pate frois gras here? Nope, you are going to get basic standard food, that I am sure you can get at their competitors as well, but here you have pretty great service, a well lit (except for one table) restaurant, and a decent amount of food for the price you pay. The only thing I would suggest avoiding, is the endless apps, and only because if you are getting those with food, you really don't do endless because the rest of the meal will fill you up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albany-2,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
20,Michael J.,"Ballston Spa, NY",1,70,66.0,2.0,2017-08-12,Service was ok and dinners were ok!  My major complaint is the endless apps!  I know why they call them endless apps because they bring you a tiny portion and then you wait endlessly for another round to come and it never does!  Asked immediately upon arrival of my first round and it did not come out until 10 minutes after dinners.  Great move Fridays to charge and bring these out slow so people won't eat a lot!!!  Never again!!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albany-2,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4

They also went up to $15. We sat at the bar at 6:15 and were only able to get one round of happy hour drinks. We were trying to get the waitresses attention for ten minutes so we could order the next round and she kept avoiding us. Then at the stroke of 7pm she came over and started with ""drinks are up to full price now"". That's horrible service and her tip reflected such.

18,Michael K.,"Manhattan, NY",102,41,,1.0,2017-10-14,"Was looking for a place to eat and not load up on carbs so thought Id try this place for a salad. Huge spacious restaurant friendly staff. Ordered something that looked good on the menu...but when it arrive the plate looked like the contents had been hit by a car. You know something is wrong when the protein portion of the meal, here chicken ,looks like a left over from last week and simply re hated in a microwave not even in a pan... Add to this old salad and canned mandarin orange slices  and cranberries that were also very old all stuck together...this probably was my mistake since the place is known for burgers and fries which is what everyone was gorging on but fried food and grease is not something I enjoy.

15,Albany C.,"Albany, NY",0,2,5.0,1.0,2017-12-26,"Positives:  Staff was friendly, cutlery was wrapped. Negatives: High chair had a broken safety belt,  bacon did not cover more than 2 bites of sandwich,  spoiled tasting mozzarella,  cutlery did not look clean,  chicken was over cooked and hard. This is not the 1st time I had poor quality food at this location and will normally avoid this restaurant because of it. For starters they had the cultery covered with a napkin which is always nice to see, because you know its clean.  But when opened, it did not look clean. Sometimes rinsing agents in dishwashing machines can do this, either way it is not appealing to use a fork that looks like this. The mozzarella tasted spoiled, and the chicken was way over cooked. On my sandwich there was a tiny amount of bacon. In a restaurant chain like this everything should be standardized with portion control down to how much bacon to put on a sandwich, and it should cover every bite of the sandwich. The staff solution to the food was to return it to the kitchen and just place a different order. We were charged the full price which is fine but most places try to add a positive when they made a mistake and created a negative. When a customer leaves with more negatives than positives it is unlikely that they will return. Complaints like this should always be brought to a manager's attention so that they can oversee how it is handled. Especially relating to something that tasted spoiled.  A manager should want to get some basic information in case the customer gets sick off of the spoiled food.  My experience with this T.G.I. Friday's has been below what I would consider standard for food and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albany-2,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
