32,Anthony B.,"Schenectady, NY",0,1,,1.0,2014-08-14,"I've eaten at many of Fridays, unfortunately I do not see myself returning to this location in the future. My mother and I were craving a juicy burger. When we arrived there was a hostess and waitress at the door. Both clearly saw us enter and neither greeted us, not even a smile. We sat ourselves and after 5 mins the same hostess came over to let us know, ""We usually seat our customers."" I guess we were supposed to stand at the door for those 5 mins. They place was far from busy at 5pm on a Thursday.. We ordered our burgers. When the food arrived at our table, the burgers and fries were cold and dry. The food was obviously reheated after it had been sitting for God knows how long. I sent mine back and did not want anything else and my mother sent her fries back in return for fresh. They brought her back, once again, reheated fries. This was the worst dining experience I've had in a long time. If I wanted reheated lunch leftovers I would have opted for some fast food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albany?start=40,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003
42,Alison V.,"Albany, NY",316,793,336.0,1.0,2014-08-29,"So, first, you should know I've been to this TGI Friday's once before - about a year ago - and had an unpleasant experience. However, in the spirit of not jumping to conclusions, we decided to give it another try tonight. It was the biggest mistake I've made in the past 6 months.  We showed up at about 8:00 pm on Friday night - there was only 2 of us. When we walked in some people were waiting, and we were told it would be a 5-10 minute wait. We agreed, took a number, and sat down. While sitting there we realized that from the entry way we could see no less than 6 empty tables, each of which sat at least 4.  After about 10 minutes, we were seated at a table that was awkwardly exposed on the highest level of the restaurant. It was a small, 2 person table, with lots of empty booths open, but not cleaned off. Our waitress came over and took our drink orders. That's about where the moderately pleasant experience ended. It took a while to bring us our very complicated drinks of a Coke and a water.  We ordered an appetizer - the fried mac 'n cheese and bacon. Shortly thereafter, we ordered our food. At this point it was maybe 8:20 pm, if that late.  The mac 'n cheese came out at about 8:30 pm. There were only 4 fried mac 'n cheese balls (which the menu did say). They were sitting in a cheese which was cold in parts. And the bacon ""garnish"" was clearly refrigerated and not even brought up to room temperature. They had potential, but lacked the follow through. And then we waited. And waited. And finished our drinks. And then we got parched. And we looked for someone to refill our drinks. Finally, the waitress came. And then we waited. And waited more. It took about 5 minutes for her to refill a water and a coke. While we waited we noticed that several tables that had been seated when we sat down were still waiting for their food. Before our food came out, we realized that the table in the corner had received food and sent a dish back since it was incorrect. The poor person who got the wrong dish took almost 30 minutes to get a replacement dish. We also saw another table where the 3 children were served their meal, but the adult at the table waited another 10 minutes for her food to be brought. The person behind us had ordered soup and another dish. He got his dish, but never the soup.  Then we did more waiting. Noticing the theme? At about 9:10 pm we finally got our food. The waitress apologized halfheartedly for how long it took and made some excuse of ""not sure what's happening in the kitchen."" I would have felt better had she once came over and told us while we sat there for nearly an hour that the food was taking longer than normal, made some effort to notice how long we were sitting there, or did anything but generally avoid us and not make eye contact each time she walked by.  I had ordered the chicken and cheese and the husband got the chicken/ribs Jack Daniels combo. I was brought the chicken and shrimp in cheese. I asked if I would need to wait another hour for the right dish and her response was she wasn't going to make me wait. Good thing since that table in the corner still didn't have their replacement dish, despite the fact that everybody else was done eating. She asked if I was allergic and when I responded no, she offered to scoop the shrimp off my plate, but I declined. She said she wouldn't charge me for the shrimp, but I could keep it.  Since I had the shrimp part, I only had 2 small chicken pieces, one of which was full of chewy, tendon feeling pieces. The veggies in my cheese were clearly frozen at some point since they were still ice cold. The cheese had burned on the bottom where it touched the hot ""sizzling"" plate. I sometimes like shrimp, if it's overly shrimpy tasting, so I asked the husband to try one. He said on his 0-10 shrimp scale, it was a 9, and declined to even eat more of mine. As such, I didn't eat any and was left feeling not very full by my meal. I had a ton of mashed potatoes, which were okay, but there's only so many mashed potatoes I can eat. The rest of my plate was covered in grease and grossness. My husband got a meal that he seemed okay with, but for the portion, the price was crazy. Neither of us even bothered to really finish our meals. Once again, we waited quite some time for our check. After over 90 minutes, we finally managed to finish our meal and pay. On the way out, I pointed out the number of dead bugs in the light over the entry and the person said a ""Thanks, we'll take care of that"" in a voice that was clearly saying ""Thanks, F-off."" I didn't even bother to point out the TV with brown drips/spots all over it or the fact that one of the cable boxes that was precariously placed on top of the TVs was a Overall, it was our second, completely, terrible, miserable experience here. Even though the food had some potential, I would never, ever come to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albany?start=20,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003

I'm a big fan of the endless appetizers promotion when they have it because you essentially get all you can eat appetizers for some of the more popular ones. Though, a couple of my favorites aren't on the promo (ahi tuna crisps and sesame jack chicken strips). Still, great way to have a few drinks and some food with a group inexpensively. In terms of entrees, you can't go wrong with the Grilled Norwegian Salman slathered in a lobster Alfredo sauce with a side order of Mac and cheese and jasmine pilaf.

Ordered a plain burger (no cheese, as I am VERY lactose intolerant), and didn't expect it to be anything out of the ordinary. Burger came to the table, and after explaining to the waitress that I ordered it without cheese, she took it back and said that they would prepare me a new one.  When my new burger came out less than 90 seconds later, I thought something was strange. After taking off the bun, I saw that the cheese was (mostly) scraped off, and the burger patty was just flipped over- as though they were hoping that I wouldn't notice.  Couldn't send it back then, since I knew the next one would be covered in spit or some new ""secret sauce"", I took about two bites of it.

I asked for sweet potato fries and paid a dollar more and they put 27 individual pieces some small and some normal size. It was 4oz instead of 6oz of regular potato. I mentioned "" is this a little shy on the fries"" the response was ""the portions are weighed"" and she walked away. She never asked how is everything because she could tell I was disappointed.

This family dinner was almost a total disaster. We were seated quickly so that was good. Great actually for a Saturday night. The waitress saw us quickly and brought us our drinks. After the appetizer, everything went down hill. We must have waited a half hour or more (after the apps came out) for our meals, only to have one meal come out cold and my steak and shrimp never come out at all. After waiting another 15 minutes I finally told them to keep the meal.  I grabbed a Big Mac at McDonalds.  The manager was apologetic but also seemed exasperated by what was happening. As if she had no control. I stood by as she discounted my check, and was surprised to see how out of hand the back of house was. Servers were picking food of off plates waiting to go out. The expediter was worthless. And most likely the reason I never saw my steak. Servers were commenting on the clearly pissed off look on my face and wondering how the manager could put up with the failings all around them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albany,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88

I complained that we had ordered extra crispy sweet potato fries and they were cold and limp and she offered to get us fresh ones. Well by the time our lame server brought them they were cold and limp again.  She stops by again to tell us she was giving us our appetizer free (wow, how generous), I told her once again how the fries weren't edible. She said but I stood right there and watched the cook drop them. She sure didn't stand right there and deliver them though, took our waiter at least ten more minutes to deliver them.

Then the host sat us at a table with no silverware without acknowledging the delay. Our server, alex(?), went minutes without getting coming over let alone getting a drink order. Finally placed our order of endless apps. Which we noticed we're taking too long and our server was nowhere to be found. Other tables of his looked unhappy as well. He finally showed up, giving my vegetarian friend potato skins with bacon on it, even though she specified no bacon. When the mistake was pointed out, you could tell he realized he messed up. Said he'd send it back and get new ones made the correct way. Well after another 10 minutes he came out with new potato skins. After she ate half of one,we realized there was bacon on the bottoms. They didn't even make new potato skins, they just uncarefully took off the bacon and brought it back out. The manager came over, didn't look bothered, said what happened was unacceptable and offered to make new pizza skins himself. We told him and the server that we just wanted the food to go and our checks. Had to ask two more times for the check before we got it.
