10,Russell H.,"Albuquerque, NM",14,18,5.0,2.0,2013-05-30,"Place was dead, ordered steak and shrimp while my girl friend got salmon, you can tell most of the food was frozen for a while, food was ok drinks were ok service was ok but still had a wait awhile for drinks and refills. So overall for ok on everything doesn't reflected in the price, I paid over $80 when I could of went to a high end restaurant and got VIP service food and drink. Defiantly not worth the money and atmosphere seems to be a run down dive bar, and this was verified by hearing the waitress and possible manager complain about lack of tips. Up quality of food, and better drink specials and put the customer first and this place could thrive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albuquerque-2,,,,,
11,Amelia W.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,16,1.0,1.0,2013-12-08,"Rubbery chicken, portion-size doesn't fit the price tag, everything was mediocre at best. Building is also really rundown. Don't waste your $",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albuquerque-2,,,,,
13,Olivia O.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,15,,1.0,2014-03-18,Worst money I have ever spent. Tables and booths were filthy. Utensils and plates were also dirty. The lunch specials was so pitiful. I was so disappointed in what they called a turkey sandwich. Just disgusting. Don't come here and waster ur money on their lunch specials.its cheap but so bland and unfresh .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albuquerque-2,,,,,
14,Niko C.,"Albuquerque, NM",5,4,,1.0,2014-04-01,"Let me start this off by saying I am not a 5 start restaurant food connoisseur, however I do enjoy going out having a nice dinner and a drink or 2. Now I know not to expect much from a chain restaurant like this, but this experience was just awful. The server we had was not bad he was nice and had a good attitude, he could learn a few mixed drinks to suggest to customers, especially when he's working the bar area. Everything seems great we got our drinks and ordered our food. The appetizer was timed perfect and tasted great. The problem came with our entrees. We both ordered a steak, one jack Daniels with shrimp and the other a simple sirloin with salmon. Both were well done when we asked for medium and they have a ""guide"" in their menu that says ""medium- hot pink inside"" this was not medium. Our steaks were clearly well done. After a few minutes he finally came back and asked how our food was at which point we asked for them to remake the steaks. He promptly brought out 2 new steaks while leaving the same sides and shrimp/salmon, the second steaks were the complete opposite!! These steaks still had a pulse! I cut it open and immediately called our server back over to have him correct this issue again. He then brought our same steaks back after cooking them more (didn't bother me, but I've worked in the food industry here in town and this is against health code!). This time the steaks were finally right so we did get to eat hit steaks but cold sides and shrimp/salmon. I've fine to other restaurants in this little area outside the mall. The other ""chains"" are as good as you can expect but this one just failed and I highly doubt I will ever even give them another try after this awful experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albuquerque-2,,,,,
9,Gary B.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,2,,1.0,2014-06-12,"Terrible. They don't clean the beer lines at the end of the night, only the beer distributor does every Tuesday, so beer on any other day of the week is gross and skunky. Go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albuquerque-2,,,,,
4,Sara R.,"Albuquerque, NM",83,89,8.0,2.0,2014-06-22,Ate here on a early Sunday. When we first got here we waited 4 minutes before a hostesses sat us.  We almost left.  I ordered tropical drink and it tasted like there was no alcohol at all.  It was a featured drink that had midori and vodka.  The waitress seemed nice so I do not blame her.   As we got our entrees the waiter realized we had no silverware.   The hostess is the first impression of the restaurant.  Food is okay but not for the price.  Go to Lonestar instead and get a 2.99 margarita and 11 dollar steak.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albuquerque-2,,,,,
6,Kenneth P.,"Lone Tree, CO",14,9,2.0,1.0,2014-08-22,"Every time we go is always a disappointment  waiter dosen't get the order right , So they bring food that you didn't order but the manager always compliments you by giving you a free meal . I really don't understand how they stay I'm business. Giving away free food instead of great service",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albuquerque-2,,,,,
5,Heidi M.,"San Diego, CA",19,50,32.0,5.0,2014-08-29,"Fridays has always been our restaurant. My hubby and I have been going since we started dating. We decided to eat here because we were in town and there's no Fridays in the small city we moved too. Had to get the usual jack Daniels ribs, double fries, extra jack Daniels sauce. I must say we like beef ribs but this sauce makes us love pork ribs. The sauce on burgers or chicken or shrimp are delicious too! Our server Jennifer was very helpful. She recommended the beer burger. Two words: delicious and spicy. The jalapeños in New Mexico and Texas are so much hotter than in Cali. I love hot and I had to take my jalapeños out because I was sweating lol. All the servers and staff were courteous and food was yummy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albuquerque-2,,,,,
7,Dan H.,"Denver, CO",0,4,,1.0,2014-10-25,Worst dining experience I can remember. Can't comment on the food since we never received any. Not even the fried green beans we order as soon as we were seated. After 30 minutes we left. No food. No service. I left money ($50) on table to pay for our drinks and food. Called manager when I got back to my room and all I was offered was an explanation how they tried to catch me when I left. No very convincing since I walk slow and was parked in first handicap spot by front door. I also had time to buckle my grandson in his car seat before I left. Slow like everything else. It is my own fault I know better than to stay at a place  that is under half full on a Saturday night 7:00.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albuquerque-2,,,,,
2,Nancy L.,"Rio Rancho, NM",19,143,1.0,2.0,2015-01-13,"Went here for a ""different"" meal from our regular places.  Place was absolutely dead!!  One or two other tables in the restaurant side - the bar side seemed empty.  Nice server, but the rest of the experience was dreadful. Hubby ordered the All American Burger - he said it was nearly cold when he got it.  I ordered a half rack of ribs and they were okay, had a good flavor but they were not ""falling off the bone"" tender.  We both had fries coming, and the ones we got had obviously been sitting on a steam table for a while - they were rubbery, tough, and cold.  The server got more fries for us, but by the time they got to the table, we were through with the rest of our meal.  I asked for butter for my broccoli - didn't come and I had to ask for it.  Had to ask for extra napkins - only one crappy napkin for someone eating ribs??? I ordered a cherry limeade slush - they charged me $3.39 for a glass of cherry limeade that didn't taste like limeade, and it wasn't a slush, it was just poured over crushed ice.  These people need to go to 7-11 or Circle K and learn how to make a slush.  AND, they wanted 45 cents for a refill!  Outrageous. To add to our displeasure, there was a booth of four people a couple of booths away from us and they were obviously drunk or well on their way to being so.  They were laughing - actually, cackling is more the proper description, so loud that I could not concentrate on reading the menu to decide what I wanted.  Then shortly before we left, a family was seated in the booth next to us, with two screeching children. This is not the first time we've been to this location, but will be the last.  The food was not very good, the ambience was awful, and the prices are waaaaay out of line.   I'll go to Red Robin for my next specialty burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albuquerque-2,,,,,
12,Aaron P.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,1,,1.0,2015-03-13,Second time I have been in.  I sit at the bar and eventually get a drink but I am not offered a menu.  Wait staff wanders looking for work while the bartender runs.  Not that busy on a Friday and I can say whoever manages this restaurant had a title and no involement.  No wonder this chain is in decline.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albuquerque-2,,,,,
1,Michelle P.,"Albuquerque, NM",25,103,211.0,3.0,2015-05-03,"I consider tgi fridays to be just an average restaurant. I usually only come on a Sunday when happy hour is all day. Service is a hit or miss, sometimes it's great, sometimes (usually) not so great. Food is average tasting to satisfy the typical taste buds, don't expect anything extraordinary or unusual or mind blowing. But great place to grab a burger, or some apps. Portions are not huge, just again, average. Bar area has a good amount of tv's that is suitable for just about any seat. Music over powers the tv so if you're coming to watch some sports, go somewhere else for the sound effects and discussions about the game",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albuquerque-2,,,,,
8,Taylor P.,"Rio Rancho, NM",3,19,53.0,2.0,2015-05-03,"So I was given a gift card and my wife and I went for a date night. So its Sunday which means happy hour all day. We sat in the bar area at a table. It started off as a 10 min wait for the waiter to even come to our table. He only took our drink order and did not offer menus, we got up and got them ourselves. The waiter had a table with friends and spent all his time with them. When there are only 3 other tables. We ordered the app nachos with guacamole on side (allergies)to share and each got an order of wings. The food was what I would say ok, the nachos came out with guacamole on the plate, buffalo sauce is lacking flavor. We were only given one napkin each for the wings so when it came time we needed more our waiter of course was with his friends. So we dealt with it and got an order of the sliders to go and our waiter didn't even bring that to us and had another waiter bring it out while he was once again with his friends. The two stars are simply for the happy hour prices. I will not return if I can help it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albuquerque-2,,,,,
3,Carlos C.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,10,1.0,3.0,2015-05-15,Food was ok they have changed the nachos grande from what I remember and not sure it was for the better. The waitress struck me as a little strange. We needed a couple minutes to review the menu and the waitress kind of just lingered. The manager seemed to be very good came around and made sure all was well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albuquerque-2,,,,,
0,Lou P.,"Rio Rancho, NM",1,52,19.0,3.0,2015-06-20,I forgot to review this place before it closed down. The food fare was edible but the reason why we came here was for the bar and drinks. Decent place and decent pricing. The employees were nice and kept up with our drinks. Will frequent this chain when going to other states. After all it's TGIF,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albuquerque-2,,,,,
