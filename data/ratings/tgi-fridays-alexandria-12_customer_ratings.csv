115,Marina R.,"Falls Church, VA",3,45,,2.0,2012-07-17,"The best word that I would choose to characterize this TGI location is ""inconsistent"". Inconsistent quality of food, inconsistent service. We have been to this place about 5 or 6 times (we literally live around the corner, so it is convenient for us), and some of our experiences could be 3 and a half stars, and some were definitely one star. The food is very generic, but not too bad. The wings, the ribs and some of the salads are decent. Some mixed drinks are good. But the service can be really horrible. During our last time there, everything that could go wrong with the service did go wrong: slow, wrong dishes, forgotten orders, requests like ""no ice"" ignored and forgotten, etc., etc. So, not a totally awful place, but very inconsistent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12?start=120,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184
133,Ron H.,"Woodbridge, VA",165,237,1035.0,3.0,2012-07-22,"This is one of the oldest Fridays in Northern Virginia.  It is the first one I ever visited back in the 1980s when I was a teenager growing up in Alexandria.  The location is kind of crazy because it sits at the corner of one of the scariest intersections around and half the parking is located in the garage of an office complex. The food is TGIF Americana - family dining with Applebees, Chilis, Ruby Tuesday type stuff but for about a third more the price.  In my opinion the drinks and bar scene is the best part of Fridays.  It's usually a very friendly place and typically provides for a decent meet market for singles in a casual setting. This was the first time I have been to this restaurant in years (I was treating my Mom to a birthday lunch with family), and I must say that they have kept the place looking new and very clean.  The tables and restrooms were crystal clean. The service was great - we were seated to our preference and served promptly.  There was a couple of greeters who came to our table to enquire whether we were being taken care of and the food was great for everybody - but not worth the price.  Of the other casual American chains, I think Friday's must be the most expensive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12?start=100,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252

The waitress took 10 mins to bring our menu out, didn't introduce herself, then took another 15 mins to bring out our sodas, another 10 to take our order then finally 45 mins later brought our food. The food was not cooked to our request. She never told us her name. Then when the bill came she totally messed that up and didn't do the correct deal prices. She also tried to argue with me what my tgi member gift certificate was for trying to say was for an appetizer and not my meal.

We were looking thru the Entertainment coupon book (yes they still make those) to see what we had a coupon for in the area. I checked the reviews on Yelp and decided to take a chance. We didn't wait long once we were seated and our waitress was attentive for the most part. She was a little spacey but she had a pleasant attitude. My mom and I ordered the shakers off of the drink menu. I had the berry mojito and she had a mango something. We both agreed they were really good but probably only had a splash of liquor in them. We both ordered the jack daniels burger which was DEEELISH. However, our fries were meh. I don't know what it is with me and sweet potato fries but when will restaurants learn that when they aren't cooked properly they taste like the freezer?? OMG! My mom asked for more fries because hers weren't cooked all the way either (she had regular french fries). That was the only downside to our dinner. The atmosphere was very loud and that was probably only because there were several basketball games on the tv.

112,J. V.,"Alexandria, VA",0,35,,1.0,2013-04-01,"I was curious to go to a Fridays after their remodel (haven't been to one in years).  This particular location was probably not the best choice. - Not sure how they manage there hosting, but everyone who had to com ein was told to have a seat to wait, but there were lots of tables available.  If the hostess was busy, the person asking you to wait should have seated you.  I witnessed this on the way in and the way out, so it seemed tio be a trend. -Bathrooms (both) were disgusting.  The mens room was trashed.  When it gets that bad, it takes time to happen.  My question, then, is did no staff member use the bathroom all day long?  It would surely have been noticed. -Menu was over priced by far. -My server was pretty good, and th food was good. -Restaurant was overall dirty Even though the food and service was decent, I would not go back because of the other factors. Update: I returned to this location after over a year, just because a family member had a coupon.  It was the worst experience I ever had in a restaurant, ever, from top to bottom.   -Dirty place, bathrooms were bad, women's room toilets were overflowing.  Staff was told, but seemed disinterested. -Food came out not only inaccurate to what was ordered, but inaccurate to the menu description.  Also, some food never even made it out. -The wait was near 2 hours to get the main course, over 20 min, for the appetizer. -Manager tried to avoid us when trying to seek resolution to the issues. -Server had two tables only but was hard to find. -A hostess walked away from us when we were trying to express concern about the poor services. -After complaining, Fridays didn't seem too concerned about learning more about the issues, they just kept trying to push me off to the same management that created the problems.

I held back on my review the first time I was here and thought it would be better the next time I come here-but nothing's changed. The service was terrible. Orders were not put through timeously. Asked for sauces and they were never brought. And just because one of my guests had an out of state licence they could not get served alcohol (totally ridiculous).

139,Demetria S.,"Glenarden, MD",0,10,1.0,1.0,2013-05-14,"OK. I waited to do this review after my first visit to see if my second visit would be better.  I visited this Fridays twice in a week (YES! I love Fridays).  One was on a Friday and the other was that next Saturday. So that Friday was by far the worst.  The waitress was pregnant so I gave her one of the two stars for ""trying"".  I ordered chicken and shrimp pasta.  It was GROSS to say the least and I eat this dish many times per month at other locations.  Back to the waitress was so forgetful and was not paying attention to our table.  I was trying to send back my food and get something else but she NEVER showed up.  I ended up sitting there eating off of my friends plate with him. I ended up getting another meal to go about 45 minutes later.  I WAS NOT SATISFIED. The next Saturday.  I went in with a clear mind and forgot about last weeks mishaps.  We got in and was seated promptly (finally a great start to what I thought was going to be great). WRONG. We waited for our waitress for a good 30 minutes. (I was ready to leave but he insisted we stayed since everything else was closed that was close in distance).  So she came over and took our drink orders and walk away so quick, we couldn't order the food (by this time we already knew what we wanted and even the dessert and additional drinks we wanted). BUT she walked away. MORAL OF THE STORY: Service is bad here.  Food is gross.

And I would guess that is the direction the management was trying to take this bar because this place is PACKED on a Friday night for happy hour.  Ladies, this is where all the single men are on a Friday night.  The bar was overflowing with young professionals.  I loved it! TGI Fridays will always be a staple for me because of their happy hour specials.  Other venues need to take note, this is how it's done! $3 appetizers and $4 drinks.  Man, it seriously doesn't get much better than this.  Even if you use this a pregame spot, your pockets will be happy.

When my brother and I saw this Friday's we decided to stop because we were both excited to see one, primarily because we hadn't been in a while. We arrived at about 7:45 pm When we arrived the hostesses and host greeted us and then began to whisper amongst themselves.I'm assuming to figure out where to seat us. All three turned their backs to us and then one began to walk away, we asked if we were supposed to be following her. She said yes. Thanks for letting us know.

Our app made it to the table before our drinks. My brother and I both ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp. It was horrible. The chicken was dry, the mashed potatoes were terrible and the shrimp, we refused to even taste. We sent the food back for two sirloin with lobster sauce. We both ordered medium well. Twenty minutes later then came my steak cooked so well done you could barely cut it and my brothers was medium. I asked for a manager and he agreed the steak was overcooked and very dry and took it back to the kitchen. My brother ate his meal and I waited another twenty minutes for my steak, which was returned medium. Still bloody in the center. The manager came by after I had my second try on my second plate. It took him about twenty minutes to check in. I told him the steak was just ok. He said, Great! and then walked away. I surprised to see that I was charged for the meal when the check came. I didn't complain, it was now 10:15 and I just didn't have the energy to discuss why I shouldn't have had to pay for that experience. My waitress apologized alot through the meal.

I am a regular at the TGI Fridays in Fair Lakes and thought that this place was going to be the same or close to the same. I do not even know where to start. After a long day of working at DC as servers my husband, co-worker, and I decided to go here as it was on our way to where we needed to go. BIG MISTAKE. We were tired and hungry and we just wanted to sit down, get some beers, get good food, and relax for a bit before going to bed. Instead, we got HORRIBLE service from the restaurant as a whole. It took a long time to get our drinks and food. Then when the food finally came, one of the dishes (a salad) had cheese and we ordered it without it because one of us are cheese intolerant. It took another 10 min to get the salad. Also, my co-worker's dish consisted of rubbery uneatable chicken so we returned it. We did not act like jerks and we were polite and apologized for returning another dish back because we know how the restaurant business works. 1, 2, 5, 20 min passed and no sign of our server nor our food. We ordered at 1:10 am and by now it was 2:00 am. The best part is that we were on our second round of drinks when the security guard came and took our drinks that were practically untouched as we were waiting for the other dish to come so we can all eat together. The manager came and said that they had basically already closed the kitchen and had to start everything and kept saying he had to talk to the server to know what happened. We had also ordered a to go order at 1:10 and apparently the server never put it on the system. Long story short.... My co worker did not get his food nor his to go order for his wife and he was still charged the two beers he drank. As customer service should be, the LEAST the manager could have done is void his 2 beers. We left with the worst experience and my co worker left hungrier than when he came in. Even a McDonald Does better than this place. Save your self a trip and never come to this place. Horrible management and customer service i have had by far, and that is a lot to say as i go out to eat frequently and have been in many different places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12?start=140,2.36,2.36,2.36,1.924,2.36

We told our waitress, and she moved us to another table.  A manager NEVER came over to apologize about the insect or even just to check on us. The waitress dropped the check off and there was no discount, no nothing. I finally had to ask to speak to a manager. The GM came out apologized, gave us two free appetizer cards and took some money off of the check.  If I had not asked to speak to someone, they would have never came to our table. I've been going to this Fridays for a long time and it seems like they can never get their stuff together.

60,Chris S.,"Alexandria, VA",127,71,27.0,1.0,2014-03-20,"Like many in the NOVA area, I have frequented TGI Fridays for their cheap and long happy hour and for being a solid last-resort choice when you can't decide where to go with a significant other/group of friends. It's generally the same lackluster result every time at different locations. For this particular location, however, they get the brunt of my disdain. My girlfriend has an odd obsession with Fridays. Her usually sound logic and reasoning skills tend to be thrown to four winds when she is under the unnatural red and white glow of their store sign.  With my prior bad experiences at other locations, I'm generally reluctant to go. Every now and again, in order to stay in her good graces on that particular day, I will tag along.  In the past three months I think she has dragged me to this location four times. Out of these four times, I think we've eaten a meal a total of once. We were literally pleading for them to take our money and couldn't get any service. None! One of those times, we said we wanted to sit in the bar area (which was full, happy hour) and offered to take a small table in the behind-the-bar section. While reminding the hostess twice, We waited 20 min to get seated. All the while, the table we were eventually sat at was empty the entire time.  It took the server another 10 min to come by. Yeah, we left.  Personally, I'm not a big fan of waits. Now, the icing on the cake was the latest visit here.  On Sunday 3-16-14, the odd itch to eat Fridays returned to my life companion. This time, I decided I wouldn't complain (as much as usual at least) my way out if this one. It took a couple minutes to get seated, but the hostess apologized, no biggie. There weren't any Irish beers for St. Paddys in stock even though a sign at the hostess stand said the special was for the whole weekend. Again, not a big deal, I didn't really want to drink anyway. Our waitress was actually friendly and attentive, told us about the special appetizers, and made sure our drinks were full. Hey, this visit has some promise! Aside from my steak feeling a little colder than normal on a med-rare, The food was actually decent and arrived quickly. Then there was the salted caramel cake, oh man was that thing delicious! Sounds like a good visit you say? Why the harsh one star rating? Well, let's fast forward to 3am when I had to visit the bathroom every hour for about 8 straight. It was like a re-creation of the exorcist from my mouth and my butt. Fun times indeed. I knew something was up with the steak because of the temperature, but it wasn't overly bloody nor did it taste bad. I should have went with my instincts on that one. How do I know it was from Fridays? That was literally the only thing I ate differently with a group of four all that day. Everything else was safe home cooked stuff. On the bright side, I'm off the hook from having to deal with TGI's terrible service and mediocre food for at least a year!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12?start=80,2.24,2.24,2.24,2.052,2.24

My sister suggested I take a shot every time he comes back to say ""Your order will be out in a few more minutes"". Good thing I didn't play her game.  At first I thought that they were serving the customers at the bar watching the NBA first, but then I overheard our waiter say to one of the hosts that the cooks in the kitchen were so behind on their orders because they were too busy watching the game too.  On top of that, our poor waiter was being bombarded with questions by this other customer who was eating alone about the restaurant not having something that was on the online app. How in the world is the waiter supposed to know anything about that? That guy was clearly complaining to the wrong person, slowing down the service even more. Service, pretty disappointing. The food was pretty basic; such a simple menu. Most of the stuff on there was just chicken and shrimp with some mashed potatoes.. Or steak and some fries.. Or some pasta with some chicken and shrimp. Save your money, and make some instant mashed potatoes, steak, or pasta at home. Might as well, since it tastes the same anyway.

We told her we wanted to sit more in the dining area and she said ""OK it will be about 20 minutes"" and pointed at the bench for us to wait.

They didn't mind us all ordering a different appetizer and having everyone on the table pick from each others' plates. I'm pretty sure that's not how the promotion was supposed to go, but better for us!  I got the boneless wings, which are essentially breaded chicken chunks, not close to wings at all. The food was all right. Exactly what you'd expect from a Friday's. The service was really good, despite us having a large group.

I have been coming to this Fridays on/off for a few years.  Usually for take-out food.  This past weekend, no one could decide what to get for dinner, it was getting late and I did not feel like cooking.  So we ordered from Fridays, like I've done numerous times in the past.  I get into my car, drive there, navigate their terribly awkward parking lot and go inside.  We're told that the food isn't quite ready.  No big deal.  So we sit and wait.  And wait.  And wait.  And wait.   As I am sitting there, getting increasingly angry, not one employee stopped to apologize, ask if we were ok, nothing.  The restaurant was no where near as busy as I've seen it on other occasions.  Finally, the food is ready.  The guy at the take-out window explained that the kitchen was backed up and they just made our order.  Ok.  Fine.  Piping hot fresh food is worth the wait.  Nope. When we get home to eat the food (3 minute drive away), we see that most of the food is ice cold.  The mashed potatoes are hard lumps, chicken dry as a bone and cracking on the outside, the ""sizzling"" cheese was congealed into a hard lump coating the bottom of the container and cold, un-cooked french fries.  The best thing was my son's burger, which we all stared longingly at while he ate it.  I've never wanted to take food from my child's mouth before in my life, but man, was I tempted. I can look past all the other problems that I've had with Fridays.  But this last visit was just too much.  Ugh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12?start=60,2.2,2.2,2.2,1.8920000000000003,2.2

Ironically, we had just seen a TGI Fridays commercial for ribs smothered in a bacon sauce before coming to lunch.    The only reason I didn't give 1 star is because the manager and the waiter handled the situation the only way they could, by comping our whole meal.

My family was in town from NY on their first night and we wanted to get out after a long day of shopping for a quick bite to eat. I was sorely mistaken. We walked in on a Saturday afternoon around 4p.m, which is a decent time considering how busy Saturday evenings can be. But again, this is Fridays; not really a popular spot to dine these days. So when I walked in  I was shocked that there was a 15-20 min wait. I am a pretty patient person but my one year old niece, is not. My sister and I did the best we could to keep her entertained as much as one can with a baby in a public place and after 30 minutes, I was getting upset. Again, the place was pretty slow so I gave them the benefit of the doubt and suspected that they were short on staff at the moment.  After about 40 minutes, everyone who walked in before and after me were either seated or had left the building. So I walked up to the hostess who was flirting with another employee and asked can I be seated. She asked for my name again and said ""OH!

I think it's ridiculous that the server didn't think he could go right to a manager to report the cook.  Then I got a manager squat down next to the table and tell me how sorry he was but made no effort to offer anything, maybe would've been nice for him to tell the server to bring the bill to him so he could make an adjustment, something as simple as taking our 6 dollar dessert. .surprise and delight your guests would be a great policy.

I asked the bartender if I could speak with a manager. The manager came up to me I explained to him what happened. Informed him that I didn't want sympathy or anything free I just wanted him to make sure that his employees were doing their job because I did find it rude that they did not at least say hello. He apologized and walked off.  A few minutes later he returned to me and said that he reviewed the camera and that it looked as if I was going straight to the bar. Really? How dare you return to a customer and try to justify a complaint on your employees and make me feel as if I'm wrong for feeing offended?

In this case it was that bad. I have been to several other fridays locations that i like. I figured this one couldn't be any different and I was wrong. To start off the hostess was running around franticly on a what looked like a very slow wednesday. she sat us at small table smushed up on another group of people eating when clearly there were far better suited areas to be placed. Our table was stickier than the second floor of mister days in clarendon. We were greeted by a very not friendly face asking us what we wanted to drink no greeting at all. for the better part of our visit she made us feel as if asking for anything was a burden. It took 10 mins to get our drinks which were a non sweet tea and a water. The food was as usual to what you get at other locations, what turned to disgust for me was the plate being thrown on the table and her just walking away. This is the service i expect from a McDonalds not a from a company that just spent millions to re brans their look and name when they should have rebranded the staffs training. Seeing sour faces the second you walk in will only ruin your experience.

When they started eating, ALL of the sticks were hollow. No cheese inside. I'm sure the cheese just escaped during cooking.

I went up to the host and asked him to send our waitress over, he did ZERO. in fact, he had the audacity to tell me to just be patient he's working on it.

56,Lexi N.,"Bowie, MD",58,2,,1.0,2016-07-17,"My bf and I stopped here for a quick bite while we were in the area for the weekend. We figured it was something we knew, we enjoyed, and that we had coupons for so it was definitely a go. Upon arrival, we stood at the front for about 8 mins until the host arrived. When he finally came up front, he bundled together crumbled sheets of paper into his arms from all over the host desk, then said that there would be a 15 min wait & asked for our names. We gave him our name & he scribbled the name down on one of the disheveled papers in his arms. 15 mins later, he took us to our table. But the worst was yet to come at this point. Throughout the night, the series of crappy events continued. First, our waitress took forever to come to the table. She was clearly irritated with the other staff. No warm or fuzziness at all. She took our app order & food order at the same time, which was as we wanted it, then disappeared into the kitchen to place the order. 20 mins later a different waitress arrives with food for our table that we did not order. We explained that it wasn't ours & she apologized then walked to another table, then walked back to the kitchen, as if she had no idea where she was supposed to be going. 20 mins later, the same thing happened with another order & a different waitress. When we explained this wasn't our order, she asked another waiter about the table numbers where he replied ""I don't know"" & they continued to have their (clearly agitated) conversation right in front of our table, expressing their frustrations. Not professional at all. But it's not over. This happened ONE MORE TIME following the arrival of our appetizer. A waitress came with the wrong food as our waitress came with our correct food. As she was placing our food on our table, she and the befuddled waitress with the wrong food engaged in an argument about how this wasn't the table number she was looking for. During their argument, another gentlemen showed up at our table with a blue motorcycle drink & placed it in front of my bf......who does not drink liquor...... Our waitress snatched it from the gentleman's hand & proceeded to walk it to another table she was working. By that time, my bf & I had asked for boxes & we're ready to head out. We'd had enough of this hell hole. But I decided to take one bite from my pasta ..... Which was delicious, but a freaking inferno. I mean PIPING hot, as if they put it in the microwave. My tongue is still burnt. By that point, we had had it with this circus. As we exited, I vowed to write a Yelp review, something I had never done before but loved reading. Anddddd here I am.  The food was delicious as always, but the waitstaff had to be part of an entertainment show hired for the evening. It was so awful, it was borderline funny. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone unless they wanted take out. The only reason I gave it one star was because Yelp is making me play nice.

Kitchen also has had an ongoing pest problem for the last 7+ years, mice and roaches, management turns over to frequently to actually fix the problem.Service is also highly inconsistent and due to the nature of the job, the turnover rate is extremely high, meaning you will most likely be served by someone who has been there a few months and will likely be gone in a few more and thus has little knowledge of the  operation.  In my opinion the only reason to visit would be to see Wagner, the head bartender who has been working there for over 32 years and is very knowledgeable, but I still can't give it more than 1 star.

10,Stacey W.,"Alexandria, VA",52,147,783.0,3.0,2017-06-01,"I like what I call ""Club Fridays"" at TGIFridays! I used to go to TGIF all the time when I was in high school and college. Then it was once every couple of years. But now with ""Club Fridays"" I probably will go more often. The first time I experienced ""Club Fridays"" was years ago when I met a friend for an impromptu meeting in Laurel. About two hours in, a DJ set up by the bar and it turned almost into a club before my very eyes. I could not believe it!  The bar area was packed, the music was loud, and people were having a goooood time. I thought it was just that location until last night. I went to a Fridays on King St. to meet up with folks. We ate, we chatted....and again after a couple of hours....we saw the DJ set up and the bartenders were busy. Add to that the game was on.....packed! So ""Club Fridays"" is a thing now! Oh and the $10 app deal is good. Order any of the ones listed and you can reorder the same item or a different one.....still pay just $10 total! Wish there was one healthy/healthier option included (like a garden salad...use iceberg if you have to but include something naturally green). Service is slow (they need to hire someone to bus tables). They won't take your plate until you leave so order away but your table will be filled with plates. If you are looking for a spot to chill at night, check out TGIFridays. At least on Thursday nights. Parking is free.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12,1.72,2.06,2.06,,1.924

She didn't serve our appetizers together, and it take 10 mins between each appetizer (4 total). She was very disrespectful, slamming dishes on table, and then putting her hand out to make us wait when we needed something. Other 3 tables she was serving had issues as well. They were upset. She didn't give us utensils after our food came and then she didn't give us the right amount of utensils when she did. She also kept bumping my arm with dishes and didn't say excuse me.

Went in on a Tuesday evening with a small group and hostess was unable to timely sit us even thought half the tables were empty. The 15minute wait seemed unreasonable and unacceptable. Overall cleanliness left much to be desired. Most of the floor was sticky and  covered in crumbs/dirt.  Once seated waited 10+minutes for the waitress to greet us. Food took over 45min to be cooked. One of the dishes, bruschetta pasta, had to be returned as the chicken was extremely dry and hard.  Overall, the server was courteous and professional.

We chose this specific location because of the late open hours it offered.  Upon arrival at this time of the night, this TGI Friday's seemed more of a biker bar with over 50 motorcycles parked out front where all the bartenders and waitresses focused on the bikers at the bar, and didn't attend to the rest of the customers on the restaurant floor.  We were told by her that they were packed and no tables were available for the size of our group when there was clearly multiple open tables around the restaurant. The hostess seemed unwilling to be proactive to arrange together two tables for us and seemed like as it we were an inconvenience to her. We were literally about to walk out after waiting almost 30 minutes to be seated when we could see more than 10 tables open around the restaurant. We were customers arriving, willing to spend money on your establishment hence I shouldn't have to beg for a seat.  There were no managers in sight, and only one(1) waitress for the entire restaurant. The service was so horrendous that even at the time to pay the bill we literally had to all go to the front hostess because our waitress was nowhere to be found.This was completely unsatisfactory, the food was excellent which is the bare minimum a restaurant must offer.

The hostess did not even bother to ask how many will be with our party. My coworker asked her if we'll still be able to get the 1/2 off appetizer deal if we sit in the dining area versus the bar and the hostess said yes. We were seated for about 15 minutes and no one had come to our table to get us drinks or take our orders. My coworker flagged down the hostess and asked if she was our server, the hostess said no and walked away.. did not even say ""I can find your server for you."" 5 minutes passed and there was someone bussing the table behind us so I asked him if he was our server. He responded with ""I've been here since 7am and I am about to get off."" Again, did not even try to help us get a server. Another 5 minutes passed and the same server finally came to our table and said ""looks like you're stuck with me, I'll be your server."" Obviously they overwork their servers and this bad energy is transferred onto the customers.  We asked him if we'll be able to get the 1/2 off appetizer deal like the hostess said and he told us that it does not apply to the dining area. We were very disappointed because the main reason we went to TGI Friday's was for that deal and if we had known from the beginning, then we would've sat in the bar area. But the hostess did not bother telling us the correct information.  We tried to flag down one of the managers to share the horrible experience we have had so far. He told us he couldn't do anything about it and made us feel like it was wrong to even share how we felt about our experience with him. I told him that this will be going on the Yelp review and this is the point where it gets really weird.. he asked for my ID because he said that I don't look old enough to be drinking an alcoholic beverage. I told him that the server already checked our IDs when we ordered our drinks. The manager demanded to see it and pulled the ""I'm the manager, I can do whatever"" card.. I showed him my ID since I had nothing to hide. This is when he said ""okay so if I see a bad review under your name, I will come find you"" I told him ""okay unless you have a photographic memory and memorized my address in the two seconds you saw my ID, then sure"" he again stated ""I will find you if I see a bad review."" My coworkers and I started getting very creeped out and politely asked him to let us continue with our dinner. He continued to hover and make things even more awkward.

2,Yannick T.,"Alexandria, VA",78,12,9.0,2.0,2017-11-04,"It mildly pains me to give this FRIDAY's a less than decent review because I've been a customer here on and off for over 10 Years. On any other occasion I'd give this location 3-Stars because it's rather consistent with what you'd expect from most chain restaurants: 1.) Consistent Food Quality. - 1a.) Consistent Price. - 1b.) Decent Service. Well the last was non existent; not by everyone...just one bartender (who I won't bother naming). Having not been to this Friday's in quite some time, I wasn't up to date on their menu nor happy hour specials. As soon as we sat down the bartender asked us if he could start us with ""a long island, margarita."" From the beer tap right in front of me...I did the math and figured they had to have more adult beverage offerings. Call me crazy...but I felt it in my guts.  I asked what the happy hour specials were...and with a straight face he said ""Long Island, margarita."" As a world class A-hole...I typically enjoy other world class A's...I truly do. I didn't enjoy this one. And with that interaction, within 3 minutes of sitting at the bar, we were both quickly soured and the bartender made no efforts at customer service. We weren't asked if we'd like menus. When we received our one menu, it was missing pages. Frustrated I had to ask another bartender for the happy hour specials and a new menu.  Once our drinks came (Long Island for me, Lemon Drop Martini for my lady), my lady asked: ""Taste this. Is it missing something."" ""Yeah. Alcohol."" ...from there the food was as expected, and the service on par with not that that great...including long wait periods and no checking how our food drinks were. It was highly disappointing overall.  Here's a bit of advice: if you're not feeling the vibe of your server or bartender, trust me, ask for another one or move to another side of the bar.
