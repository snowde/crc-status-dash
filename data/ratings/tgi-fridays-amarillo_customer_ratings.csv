1,Alexandria J.,"Gilbert, AZ",36,37,10.0,1.0,2013-05-22,Possibly the worst customer service ever. I sat at the bar and ordered a beer never saw the bartender again. The other two severs sat at a table and ate. I was never offered a menu or another beer. Shouldn't have paid for the one I did have,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-amarillo,,,,,
