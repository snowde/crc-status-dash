5,Jeruen D.,"Berlin, Germany",35,1135,796.0,2.0,2012-06-11,"I always have low expectations for chain restaurants. And sure enough, on our latest visit to Friday's, my expectations matched the experience.  We went to Friday's because it was 11 PM and nothing else was open, and yet we were hungry. The place was almost empty, except for an occupied table or two. That being said, we waited almost 5 minutes to get a table, as no one was watching the front door. One would assume that since they are less busy, then there would be more hands to deal with customers, right? I ordered the French onion soup, while the accomplice ordered the strawberry fields salad. That's all we got, we were just a little hungry, not starving at all, it was clear that was all we wanted, so, why did the waiter give us a barrage of words, which later on I realized, were the names of their desserts? I didn't recognize it to be English until a few seconds later. Oh, and the French onion soup. It's supposed to have croutons, not a huge baguette slice. Do they expect me to use my knife to cut it in order to eat it? And why was the broth too salty? It almost tasted like they put soy sauce in it.  Oh well, you might ask, why were we here then? Well, only for the reason that they're open late and the rest are already closed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-amherst-3?start=20,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002
13,Ashley R.,"Ajax, Canada",0,7,2.0,4.0,2012-09-09,"This restaurant was absolutely great! I had visited T.G.I.'s before and it was so horrible that I vowed to never go back, but I had to go as it was a family dinner that I could not say no to. Wait times were a bit too long, but it was worth it for the dish that I got. Surprisingly, the portion was small, however, the taste of the food made me forget every negative thought about this place. I had ordered the Sizzling Shrimp and Chicken... Dessert was even better. I had the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS. All in all, this was a good location, and renewed my faith in T.G.I.!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-amherst-3?start=20,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.4480000000000004
9,Nicole J.,"Buffalo, NY",189,167,81.0,3.0,2013-10-17,"Eh, what can really be said about T.G.I. Friday's that hasn't already been encompassed by a thousand other reviews?  Some of my girlfriends and I will stop in here when we have an entree coupon or just need a little happy houring after work. Even though everything is standard T.G.I. Friday's fare, I do feel obligated to admit that, as far as sit-down chains go, Friday's is one of the better ones. The drinks are yummy, if nothing special, and the food is passable, even if the execution and individuality that is characteristic of local establishments is completely absent. The Jack Daniel's burger preceded by the warm pretzels with craft beer cheese appetizer is a nice combo.  Unless you're coming with a family or on an intimate date, I would recommend sitting at the bar. The service is just as good as sitting at a table and you can usually bypass the hefty wait time that seems to be a constant facet of this specific location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-amherst-3?start=20,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284

As a Professional Basketball Organization we called in advance to ensure we would have proper seating and was informed that proper accommodations would be met. NEEDLESS TO SAY,  but for the sake of filling in the character count, nothing was as it was supposed to be, then to top it off, they are withholding funds because of their own mistake, affecting the travel budgeting of our team.......The manager tried to insult our intelligence rather than own up and resolve the situation probably to make the day a record number because we fed 12 athletes and coaches.......we are in town 1 more day but have to.wait until Monday to.get funds???????

I realized I didn't even write about the food in my previous review, so this time I can't not mention the delectable cheeseburger I had here. America truly is the land of the free, I was free to decide how I wanted my burger cooked...and I chose PINK. And that was a good choice!!! Massive and juicy, the flavour rivaled that of 'gourmet' burger joints I've tried! Although everyone jokes about the massive portion sizes in the US, the amount of fries they gave was perfect. I also was able to try their homemade mac n cheese (which normally...if it's not KD I don't want anything to do with it) but this was a nice penne pasta with cheese and crumbs on top and it was really good!!

I informed my waitress and she said ""just the one?"" As if that was a positive. My expectation was that none of my pretzels would be raw. Throughout the meal she mentioned it was only one a few times as if I was making a big deal out of nothing. The cost of the pretzels was $7.95 and at the end if the meal they took $5 off.  Honestly the way they handled the situation turned me off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-amherst-3?start=20,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002

38,Camille T.,"Queens, NY",164,2,1.0,1.0,2015-08-26,"We came in tonight for the endless appetizers special and we were seriously disappointed with the service and food. Our waiter, Mark, showed no attentiveness towards us and demonstrated poor service. His first words to us were ""The kitchen is out of everything"". It left a horrible impression and set the negative pace for the night. We were not given any silverware, plates or even a heads up that our food was running ridiculously late. Our wait for our FIRST round of appetizers ended up being 40-45 minutes. We weren't offered any refills on our water and our server neglected to offer us the usual chips and salsa while we waited. But maybe they ran out of that too? Overall, we were really disappointed with our experience. In comparison to the other Fridays that we've been too, this is by far the worst.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-amherst-3,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.2440000000000007

10,Jackie W.,"Buffalo, NY",3,21,21.0,2.0,2015-10-18,"My friend's and I biggest problem with this place was the service we received from our server Chelsea, she has short black hair and is light skin. The fact that they were out of three of four apps I wanted didn't help much. There's only like seven for the endless apps so doesn't leave you with much of a choice. Also they were out of the my two favorite martinis! The smorez and the cooler one. Even then I wasn't upset at all, I really could work with anything BUT bad service.  Chelsea literally came over took our order and never came back. I watched as she went to her other ONLY three tables, sat down with them, chatted, laughed, got them drinks, as my drink sat empty. I had to walk over to the BAR to actually get another drink. It was such a terrible experience. Our food took about 25-30 minutes to come out and that's the next time she made it even remotely close to our table. My partner and I are both servers and I know it gets busy so the fact that the food took long is not a problem. The fact that Chelsea took it upon her self to not check up on us for 25 minutes was the problem, she clearly saw me waving her down and didn't care. She'd rather go sit down with her other tables and continue her conversation. I don't know if it was my race or the fact that we are in our twenties and she thought she wasn't going to get tipped but the service was unacceptable. Therefore she lost out on an amazing tip! We know the life of a server, I've been doing this for six years,  no excuse Hun!

I ordered off their 'gluten free' menu the flat iron steak with mashed potatoes. I asked to add grilled shrimp as well. Steak was under cooked, potatoes were cold and service was awful (rushed). The worst part though is that the shrimp looked like it had breading on it. I asked the waitress and was informed that it was definitely gluten free. Two shrimp later, I knew there was no way.

25,Zack R.,"Rochester, NY",160,93,63.0,2.0,2016-12-16,"This Friday's is not good.  Everytime I come here my waiter or waitress doesn't seem to be trained correctly. Today is a perfect example of this. Our waitress took about 15 minutes to even ask us for drinks and we were on a timed schedule so this was a bit disconcerting. The hostess had to tell the waitress that we were there. This has actually happened on at least two other occasions at this location. Once we got our waters our waitress failed to get us straws and took another 10 minutes to get drinks. Following this, the food as usual, was actually quite delicious. It always is. It's just a struggle getting there. It then took another half an hour before we had our checks given to us, after finishing and luckily the payment portion was relatively quick.

All I ordered was the endless apps and all I got was 7 boneless wings and gave up on the rest because I was still waiting.
