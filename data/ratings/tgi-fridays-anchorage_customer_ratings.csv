The atmosphere was, for lack of a better word, strange. The clientele was eclectic, the servers were an unpolished group and the hostesses clustered at the door were dressed, made up and wearing jewellery that seemed out of place in a sit-down restaurant. Perhaps some diners like to be called ""guys"" or ""boss,"" but that is far too casual for my tastes.

22,Jessica S.,"Anchorage, AK",24,2,,1.0,2014-07-31,"My first time writing a review.... I just had too! Haven't been back to this restaurant in years due to the service and food. Only reason why I was here tonight was due to a friends birthday dinner. The service was HORRIBLE! I can say that I will not be coming back. Our waitress was Ana. The first issue was when I asked her about what was all in the ginger lime salad she couldn't tell me. I went ahead and just ordered it. Second issue was when I asked for a water refill she came back with a cup of water for me w/o checking on the rest of the table. If she looked around she would've noticed that other people should've had their water refilled too. Third issue was that my friends strawberry vinergette salad had a piece of wood chip in it. The manager did come out to apologize and offered to comp the salad, which was rightly  so.  My issue was with the service. Ana asked us if we wanted to split the checks and we said yes. She came out wiring only two checks when we should've had 5 checks. She then proceeded to argue with us when we questioned one of the checks. They should've had 4 drinks N instead they had 5. The other drink should've been on one of the other checks. What she should've said was apologized for the mistake and fix it instead of arguing back. The final straw was when my friend told Ana that she wanted to pay $85 in cash and the rest on her card ( this is because she did not split the check like she was suppose to). She got the receipt back and it looked like she had ran the card for the full amount. Thank goodness we checked because that's exactly what she did. If nothing was said this lady would've pocketed $85 in tips in which she did not even deserve a penny. Manager came back and said nothing could be done. All he can do is make an adjustment and the difference will be  back on the card in a few days.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-anchorage?start=40,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004

I will say that I was not too happy at the start of the night when we sat at a table at in the bar area and sat there for a good 15 minutes before a server came to the table. When she arrived at the table she could see that we were upset, but to her credit she was just arriving on shift so we appreciated that she acknowledged us on her way to clock in. She was very knowledgeable and made a great recommendation seen as though they did not have the special that I saw on TV. I ended up having the Jack Daniels Burger with sweet potato fries and it was delicious. That Jack Daniels sauce they have is simply delicious. Overall the experience was ok.

We have been here several times since moving here and it's usually the same experience. It's not 4 stars and it's not 3 stars. It's just somewhere there, in the middle but yelp doesn't have a half star option. This restaurant is nice for hanging out with friends and having a drink while in a family friendly environment.  I found that over the years the quality of food has decreased. While this place isn't terrible,  it's not amazing or mind-blowing either, it's just mediocre in my opinion. Much of the fried foods taste like pre-packaged food that you can reheat in your own home. The baby back ribs had a great flavor but did not have the visual appeal of deliciousness. Even still, it's nice to go out and let someone else do the cooking or nuking. Customer service is pretty friendly here and I still continue to enjoy visiting this restaurant once in a while, but it is not my top choice. It just need a certain umph.

The steak was well done, I ordered medium, with slabs of fat dangling off it and partially plopped on top- it looked like someone started cutting it off but decided it was too much effort but yet there was a lot of effort put into making sure this was going to break a world record for the thinnest steak. I also noticed tonight that most of their ""new"" items are the exact same things they've always had. Some were the exception with ""it has a different spice than we used to do"". I haven't been missing much in the past two years I haven't been here.  But the appetizer was amazing! And the waiter was very warm and friendly! The hostess could learn some manners though. The woman there noticed us and came over but then just stood there ignoring us.

I love seafood, so if anyone else does too order the Friday's Shrimp and ask for Jack Daniel's sauce. It definitely makes the meal.

After the hostess seated us it was a solid 5 minutes before our server appeared. At that time I asked for water and we order drinks. 15 minutes goes by and the drinks arrive, but no water =( The drinks were actually pretty damn good, better than Tequila 61's at almost half the price! We all order burgers and wait another 15 minutes, the burgers arrive. Still no water for anyone. The burgers were pretty good, but not quite to the $14 level my burger cost. We finish off the burgers and then order dessert. The desserts arrive, but no napkins and still no water.  In the end I spent well over $30 for a completely forgettable dining experience. I get that it was a Saturday night, but they were at most 75% full. Look, we aren't reinventing the wheel here, the basics of food service are water and and napkins, and I got neither of them!

TGI Friday's is located on the corner of Tudor and C St. opposite the Cattle Company restaurant and next to the Golden Corral. The layout of their bar area has a good amount of TVs and projection screens for viewing all of the NFL games but the bar takes up a significant amount of space between the stools and the booths with its large square-shaped counter.

The bartender was also helpful in setting me up with a good seat to view my game before taking my order. I decided to try one of the promotional lines of pizza that just came out a couple of weeks ago. I went with their Garlic Chicken and Spinach Pizza (grilled chicken, minced garlic, spinach, and mozzarella on a garlic butter base) which comes in a 10-in. size. The pizza only took a few minutes to arrive and it was very tasty. The pizza was topped with a generous amount of minced garlic along with lots of mozzarella as well as a crispy crust basted with a good amount of the garlic butter sauce. I knew the pizza was arriving when that delicious garlic aroma filled up the entire room. It was the perfect size for a filling lunch and I still had room for dessert. I decided to try their Tennessee Whiskey Cake (oven-baked toffee cake with vanilla ice cream topped with Jack Daniel's Whiskey butterscotch sauce). I also got the option for Bailey's Irish Cream liquor for an added kick.  The Whiskey cake was outstanding and the vanilla ice cream surprisingly complemented the Irish Cream liquor very well. In addition to the pizza and dessert, TGI Friday's had an assortment of new items that came out on their menu which includes the Sriracha Shrimp Roll (sriracha shrimp and house-made guacamole on panko-crusted rice rolls served with a sweet soy glaze and cucumber-wasabi ranch), the Truffle Stacked Burger (two fresh patties served with a blend of four cheeses, truffle oil, truffle aioli, onion-bacon jam, and Applewood-smoked bacon), the Grilled Norwegian Salmon with Langostino Lobster (seasoned with hickory sea-salt topped with lobster and cremini mushrooms in a roasted Alfredo sauce), and the California Chicken Club (grilled chicken breast on a toasted baguette with bacon, smoked gouda, chopped romaine, tomatoes, avocado, and yogurt aioli). The new specials they are currently promoting is the 474 menu which is $4 appetizers, $7 entrees, and $4 desserts. A great place to watch the football games on Sunday in spite of the narrow aisles when it gets crowded. My overall experience was a positive one in regards to the service and atmosphere. It's always good to add another option for a Sunday football game instead of having to go to the same place every weekend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-anchorage,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

This location doesn't have any special drink specials. They do seem to offer $3.50 16 oz bud light drafts every time I've been in.  I've only sat in the bar area. It's seat yourself. Bartenders are all very friendly service. If you sit at one of the tables service can be spotty.  Depending on when you come in the bartender may be taking care of you and the bar, which can make service slow and not as attentive.  Always clean.

45,Michael O.,"Anchorage, AK",54,33,3.0,2.0,2017-06-02,"See, this started off on a bad note because I went to a TGI Fridays on a WEDNESDAY. Thus, my visit was doomed from the start. In the vicinity of C Street and Tudor there's about 59 steak houses and restaurants within about half a mile radius of the intersection, and I thought one Wednesday in May, ""Huh, guess I've never been to this TGI Friday's before,"" so I went. Since I was with my parents, and my dad is an avid sports fan, we decided to go for the bar side instead of the normal restaurant side because of the mounted TVs on the walls with sports playing. Alright, so far so good. Check over the menus, get asked if we need more time, sure, take a little more time... And ok, ready to order, so everyone sets their menus down. Two minutes go by. Five minutes go by. Ten minutes go by. Fifteen min-- Oh there's the waiter that's been walking in circles for the last 14 minutes and 59.9 seconds chatting with his coworkers and not serving anyone anything and just refilling water. GREAT, he's our waiter. Order a teriyaki burger and request it cooked medium-rare, and I shit you not, the waiter says, ""We can only cook them medium, it's state regulations."" ESSCYOOZ ME?! I have been to literally dozens (dozens!) of restaurants in Anchorage and throughout the state that serve burgers and steaks, and I have never once heard this about only cooking burgers to medium because of some regulation. It takes a bullshitter to know a fellow bullshitter, and I don't know if you could tell by the tremendously massive wall of bullshit I just wrote... But I called that guy's bullshit from a mile away. In the end, that burger came out more scorched than Anakin Skywalker on Mustafar after his duel with Obi-Wan Kenobi. Apparently it's state regulation to scorch a burger patty in lava, put it in a McDonalds bun, serve it with soggy and lukewarm fries, and have the audacity to call it ""medium"". Some might not wonder so much if I called this experience ""medium shitty"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-anchorage,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

I've been to other locations in the Lower 48 that didn't suck like this one did!! And that were actually enjoyable! The service was crap, the shake they brought out for my son was a mess! I had to keep asking for paper towels because they had over filled the thing so bad with whip cream & just milk in general. He is a little guy & had a hard time enough trying to drink it without making a mess they should of taken that in to consideration!  When I got my fish I was appalled by how small it was!  And it wasn't even very good! We are our meal, tipped, & left! I'm not gonna make a fuss in the store because really it's not the waitress fault the food was sh:t, ya it was her fault she was slow as molasses but her tip reflected that!!! Get it to get it to gather AK restaurants, people work hard for their money, TOO HARD TO GO EAT ONLY TO GET SMALL PORTIONS OF CRAPPY FOOD, or bad service!

55,Dori K.,"Portland, OR",0,2,,2.0,2017-08-21,"This place was awful! Our server, Nikola, was the only bright spot of the evening. We planned to just get appetizers, so we started in the bar. We sat there for 20mins while 4 employees (one of which appeared to be a manager) walked around and never acknowledged us. We gave up on ordering in the bar and told the hostess our situation. She took us to seats in the restaurant section, with no apology whatsoever. Nik came promptly and took our order - even getting us a side of crispy onions that we thought looked good from a picture of a salad. We have loved their potato skins in the past, but these were horrible. They were dry and chewy. When we got down to our last potato skin, we pulled out a long black hair... Nik was upset and went to tell his manager. He came back and said the manager told him that, since we had already eaten all of the skins, he would only take 50% off. Nik kept apologizing... Since when doesn't a chicken manager come out to face a customer himself? Ridiculous. Nik saved this place from one Star...  we won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-anchorage,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
