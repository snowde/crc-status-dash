14,Liana W.,"Appleton, WI",3,31,1.0,5.0,2013-07-18,"TGIFridays is definitely as good as it gets for this type of restaurant in the Valley (and by type I mean big chain family establishments - think Applebees or Chilis). My companion and I were here over the weekend and were pleased to see that they had small plates. I have been wishing that more restaurants would get on board with this trend - it's SO much easier to control the amount of food you get with small plates AND you get to try so many things! We ordered an appetizer (pretzels with the beer cheese, which is why my husband loves the place) and five small plates (plates can be bought individually, 3/$15ish, 5 for $22).  I mentioned to the waiter when we ordered that we hadn't gotten our drinks yet and he hauled booty to the bar to rectify the situation. I'm thinking that our drinks (peach mango lemonade is an awesome non-alcoholic option that's still fancy) had been made, but had been left sitting at the bar. Not a big deal, it just seemed odd that we hadn't received them yet. Our waiter, Preston, was very apologetic and even the manager, I believe his name was Mike, came over to apologize. It was far more attention than I expected for a small error, but it was appreciated. The food was pretty awesome - I enjoyed the Thai pork tacos and the chicken and steak skewers, my husband thought that the parmesan meatballs were the best. I believe he liked the ahi tuna as well, but it comes with a bunch of fresh jalapenos, so beware. We joined the stripes rewards program because it's SO easy - no membership card to keep track of and your membership number is your phone number, so why not? One meal in and we have a free dessert waiting for us next time, and there will be a next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-appleton,,,,,

20,Lizabeth L.,"Marinette, WI",0,17,2.0,2.0,2014-07-20,"Good food, good service. Ended up sick the rest of the night. It wasn't the meat cause I didn't eat any.

7,Marcia V.,"Louisville, KY",109,615,287.0,3.0,2015-12-14,"Went here to meet some friends for endless apps. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. When ordering, they allowed us to get too orders at time, and were brought out fresh. A good place to go if your around the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-appleton,,,,,
13,Amanda B.,"Green Bay, WI",44,8,,2.0,2016-01-01,"Went here on New Years day after shopping at the mall. Not sure if they were short staffed, but our waiter forgot who ordered what or who had what drinks & there was only two of us. The hostess was spacey. She wandered off a lot leaving some people seating themselves. She hardly greated anyone,  never looked at us when we walked in just how many of us there were. I ordered no onions on my burger and the waiter repeated me and low and behold i had onions. A few girls had phones in their pockets. Overall, service was sucky. Burger was pretty good though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-appleton,,,,,
8,David C.,"Appleton, WI",8,5,,4.0,2016-04-03,"The appetizers were delicious.  We had the pot stickers which were amazing, boneless wings, and the pretzels.  My son had the half rack of ribs which he devoured and was still hungry.  But it was no matter because the rest of us had enough to share.  The bourbon barrel chicken was delicious and very similar to the jack daniels chicken without the jack daniels sauce.  We noticed another table was having all you can eat appetizers for $12 per person, which would be a great option based on how good the appetizers are.  It's a good reason to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-appleton,,,,,
9,David A.,"Euless, TX",4,34,19.0,4.0,2016-04-13,I must eat here every time I am in Appleton. The service is usually really good. The food is about what you'd expect from a chain. This visit however my broccoli cheese soup had too much broccoli. I know it is the first ingredient but I felt like I was eating just broccoli. It was still good though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-appleton,,,,,
6,Shahid S.,"Menasha, WI",22,14,,3.0,2016-10-19,$13 for a burger? $4 for a soda? $10 for apps?The Jack Daniels ribs were delicious as always. But the prices are getting up there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-appleton,,,,,
5,Megan S.,"Sturgeon Bay, WI",53,15,25.0,2.0,2016-11-06,"The jack daniels sauce is the ONLY good about today's stop. Sat in a booth in the bar. The bartender only came back twice. I needed a napkin and he wanted more ""all you can eat shrimp"" I had to keep stopping the busses and asking her. If the bartender was having too much trouble getting to the TWO other people sitting at his bar, he should have asked one of the other 10 employees. It was NOT busy at all and we did not eat checked up on as often as we needed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-appleton,,,,,

1,Lore V.,"Appleton, WI",0,1,,4.0,2018-01-12,"This restaurant is pretty awesome with the taste and quality of their food. It's almost the only place I visit where I don't order a salad or pasta. The Bourbon Barrel Chicken is DELICIOUS and so well worth the price. Anyway, I digress, as my visit earlier tonight left a sour taste in my mouth. My husband and I walked in after a long day at work and were told to go choose our own table. Umm, okay? We sat in the far back near the bar and were brought menus right away. Morgan was our server and took our drink order. She was quiet but really pleasant. She returned with the drinks and gave us time to peruse the menu. Once we were ready, we ordered a potato skins appetizer, shrimp & chicken sizzler, and fish & chips. The potato skins came out and were delicious, but I HATE that you only get 1 small cup of sour cream for eight potato halves. My husband and I always play a silly game where we each choose one at a time until we've split them equally. Before we were even done putting them on our plates, Morgan was asking how they tasted. I didn't respond. When our entrees were delivered, someone decided it was a good idea to leave the tails on the shrimp and then douse them in marinara sauce. Naturally, I grabbed one and started to chew, only to get the crunchy end stuck in my throat. Once I realized what it was and spit it out, the waitress was already back asking how our food was. I told her it was good since I was pissed and didn't want to start treating her poorly for it. And, to be honest, the flavor was good even if I did almost choke. Shortly after we started eating, Morgan brought a second drink and placed it behind my barely-half-finished one. She didn't ask if I'd like another or if I even wanted the same kind, so it sat on the table getting watery, then I didn't drink it because she asked about dessert and brought the check WHILE WE WERE STILL EATING. I was visibly sharing shrimp with my husband and he was putting fish on my plate, but that didn't stop her! I was overall incredibly annoyed tonight. In the future, I'll certainly look out for tails on my shrimp, but Morgan seemed very eager for us to leave and thus, greatly hampered a normally enjoyable dinner at TGI Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-appleton,,,,,
