Why not Fridays? Cons Screaming children. Like enough to fill a Chuck-E-Cheese. The food on the menu is the food on the menu. You want the Pasta with Chicken and Shrimp to be without Chicken? Negative, it's already made up. And there's a lot of sauce. The strawberry and goat cheese salad was overloaded with too much dressing. The brownie dessert had an overload of sugar.  Pros The linguine was cooked perfectly. The ice cream with the brownie was great. Non-alcohol options were excellent. Virgin Margarita and O'Douls (even though the latter isn't on the menu). Wifi. I've not been to a Friday's in 5+ years or I would have Yelped it. I think I'm safe to say I will probably give them a pass for the same again.

37,Jenna S.,"Wilmington, NC",0,25,,1.0,2014-07-15,"I had an awful experience at this TGI Friday's. My family showed up on a Friday night for a late supper (around 8:30pm). We were greeted at the door and were seated at the furthest back table (which is fine, but we passed so many other empty tables along the way). They seated us next to a large party table (3 tables pushed together) with lots of kids running around. This doesn't really bother me, but we asked to be moved ONE table down, just so we wouldn't be seated right on top of the other family. Our hostess was extremely rude, huffing and puffing about us asking to move to another table. She slammed our menus down and walked away. We sat down, totally confused on what had just happened. She came back a min or two later and we just flat out asked her if it was a problem for us to be at that table. She was very curt, and said ""NO!"" and walked away again! We just gathered our belongings and walked out. I don't think I have ever walked out of a restaurant. I didn't even have the patience to speak to a manager. This girl was a total jerk. I just wanted to get my family out of there and go somewhere half-way decent. I will never go to this Friday's location again. I cannot believe how we were treated. Completely ridiculous. And on top of everything else, the floor was disgusting. My shoes stuck to the floor as we walked through the dining room and there was trash and food all over the place. If you are in Asheville, there are lots of other dining options. Steer clear of this Friday's location. It's a shame because most Friday's are really good.

One entree, a grilled salmon dish, was painfully overcooked. No amount of cream sauce could fix the damage inflicted upon this unfortunate fillet o' fish. The other entree, a mediocre burger topped with cheddar and bacon, was merely 'okay'. Also of note, the fries were omitted due to kitchen error. (I suppose I could be thankful of the carb savings.) Our server did the best she could, given the ineptitude of the kitchen staff. She made the good faith effort of removing the salmon entree from the final bill, so kudos to her.

He had seen a commercial for endless apps and he said the ad looked so great he wanted to try the boneless wings.  We were sat in the back beside a partition where two large parties were going on, but we didn't mind because they were very chill, children included, and being polite. We straight away ordered a kids meal for junior and when the server brought our drinks she took our order. Our order came out right away but junior was still waiting for his kids meal, that finally came a little less than 5 minutes after our meals did. He only had one refill on his drink, boyfriend too which was fine with me because $7 for a draft craft beer was a bit pricey. Our server was polite and friendly but I will note that the two parties had left and a group of servers went to clean the area and complained nonstop about the guests. I guess they didn't realize we could hear everything they said... A little unprofessional. The food was ""meh"", but junior asked for a bowl of cereal when we got home because his pasta was sticky and the sauce tasted like it came from a can.

4,Tyler W.,"Asheville, NC",12,29,11.0,1.0,2017-04-05,"This review is for TGI Friday's in Asheville, NC. To be honest, I was really excited about eating at TGI Friday's because it was one of my first visits, and I was going to order the endless appetizers.  I went at about 2:00 to eat and hardly anyone was in the restaurant. I walked in and the hostess had her back turned. She finally acknowledged that I was waiting and said ""Hello,"" and I said ""Hello"" back. I was then seated in an area that was literally right beside the door, which I thought at first was convenient. The restaurant was not busy in the slightest and I literally sat and waited for fifteen minutes without a waiter. There were PLENTY of waiters walking around and goofing off in the kitchen. Considering someone that has managed a restaurant before, you would think they would know how to serve a customer. I was getting up to leave, because personally I don't feel like waiting fifteen minutes to be waited on, and the waiter comes over to the table. I was in an annoyed mood by the time they came to the table, but I reluctantly stayed because I was hungry. I ordered the endless appetizers and a water. The water came out quickly, but it took nearly twenty minutes for one appetizer to come out. After I finished that appetizer, I ordered another one. The appetizers come slower and slower, I guess because they think you need to have time to eat all of them. I was somewhat less amused at this. I finished my meal, paid my check, and left. This kind of behavior and experience for a restaurant is unacceptable. If you have a customer in your area that you're serving, then you should probably make your way to their table. I will not be back to TGI Friday's any time soon. If you're thinking of eating here, then read a few reviews and then change your mind. In all honesty, you would be better staying at home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-asheville,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24

Right as we walked in a lady who worked there was standing there on her phone, didn't acknowledge us. When we asked her if we should just seat ourselves she said that someone would seat us. Figured that she was on break or about to get off, which is understandable, but I work in the food service industry and even if i was about to get off or was on a break and I saw people come in, I would seat them or at least smile and welcome them. Our waitress was very sweet but got my sister's order wrong. She wanted just a plain cheeseburger. Just the bun, burger and cheese. Nothing else. The waitress seemed to have it down but when the burger came out it had LTO (which could be easily taken off so no big deal) but it had this sauce on it. We asked for it plain. When we asked if we could have a new bun, she happily got us a new one. We waited about 10 minutes for mayo. Oh and the restaurant was almost empty so they weren't busy. The appetizer came out literally 1 minute before the entree's. My sisters or mom's drinks weren't refilled once. Took forever to get the check. I never write reviews but I felt like I needed to.
