Well I decide to give them another try. The spinach dip was a little cold.... But ok. My waiter was the best, she suggested a great drink... Um, Captain Jacks Island fruit punch... Delish! She even chatted a sec about football. My fried shrimp with Jack Daniels sauce was good but no where near the way it used to be years ago. Oh and my shrimp was like popcorn size.

87,Lillian T.,"Jonesboro, GA",8,12,,3.0,2012-12-04,"Visited this location on Saturday to watch the Alabama vs Georgia football game.  Sat at the bar, good view of game from various Televisions.  Atmosphere was great, everyone geared up for their team.  Really crowded, but not too much of a wait for the food. Ordered Beef Craft Burger with Fries which had jalepenos and a spicey mayonaise with guacamole. The Burger was juicy, good flavor.  Also ordered a cocktail Long Island Ice Tea, not really strong. I also sampled some of the Jack Daniels Sampler, ate some Chicken and Shrimp, did not sample the pork. The shrimp was lightly fried decent flavor, the chicken was better with a sweet type sauce glazed over it.  The overall experience was good, Alabama won the game!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-11?start=80,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998

Not impressed at all with the overall service."" ---------------- This review is on 3/30/13 and it is no different than what J M. Wrote.  He was spot on from the very first sentence.  I am a huge fan of T.G.I. Friday's.  In fact, when it comes to those chains: T.G.I. Friday's, Applebees, Chilis, Ruby Tuesdays, etc...Historically T.G.I. Fridays has always been my favorite.  I will not let this particular location change my perspective because  I know there are great locations but the one on Camp Creek SUCKS!   Service is beyond slow as the aforementioned.  As far as the appetizers, they are o.k.  I always loved the mozzarella sticks but it wasn't the best thing in the world.  The mozzarella sticks you can buy from Publix or Kroger out of the box tasted better than that crap!  Ordered the Ribs & Shrimp.  The ribs were COLD!  GTFOH.  Jack Daniel's ribs....cold. Oh hell naw Tommy! #MartinVoice.  That's just the food itself.  My biggest knock is the service.  A)  Sat down in the booth, waited 10 minutes before a service came by to to take order for beverages (let alone food) and then another 10-15 mins just for the drinks to come to the table. Here's my wife's take on her experience as she is sitting right next to me as I type this review as if I'm a stenographer in court :  Wife - ""Ok, I thought this was the slowest service I've ever had in 28 years.  It took 30 minutes just to get a damn lemonade drink though it took an hour to get my food.  Though my food was good, it was kind of cold, I was choking on the shrimp while I had to wait another 15 minutes just to get another lemonade.  It took 15 minutes to get a frozen brownie to go.  The most retarded thing I saw was they gave out those reservation slips instead of the buzzer that most restaurants are accustomed to.  You had to listen in like a damn FBI agent just to hear your number called.  Don't waste your time going unless you like to wait 1-2 hours from the time you get there and to the time you leave"" I'm back at the helm.  If there is another T.G.I. Fridays within 30 minutes drive from East Point and you are craving, go to that other location for sure.  I know there's a T.G.I. Fridays in Concourse E at Hartsfield-Jackson.  If I have to get a boarding pass just to eat some Jack Daniels ribs, I rather go to that location and waste time at the one on Camp Creek.  I know reviews, this service sucks!

79,Michelle B.,"Birmingham, AL",51,231,1.0,2.0,2013-06-09,"Positively abysmal. I went with 2 stars instead of one just because the food was edible. We got a 20% off coupon in the mail, and while we don't normally eat at these types of restaurants, we couldn't resist the bargain. We would live to wish we had resisted. This was the slowest service I've experienced in Atlanta. We had two different servers, so that was confusing. The guy who ended up helping us was obviously working very hard and had tables all over the restaurant. Most of the rest of the staff was milling aimlessly. We were there for 2 hours and not because we were chatting. It took them 20 minutes to deliver a bottle of beer to the table, for God's sake. My burger was decent (NY Cheddar and Bacon with a turkey burger substituted) but it didn't have all of the toppings the menu described. By the time I got it, I was so hungry that I just ate it. Not that anyone was around to complain to, anyway. I was looking the whole time for a manager or someone who I could speak to about how terrible the service was, but no dice. Even my receipt was messed up so I couldn't see if or where they had discounted it 20%. I didn't short the guy on the tip because I felt that it was a management problem.  We will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-11?start=60,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216
99,Q D.,"Marietta, GA",25,30,7.0,1.0,2013-06-20,"Apparently on order to get service here you have to know someone.  I came early on game night along with three others and lucked up and got some seats at the bar.  Well first the bar tender asked us was we staying there and we said we r about to switch seats with these wonderful gentlemen since they had a booth and it was two of them and four of us. She immediately said ""S@! T"".  Yup thats what she said. Unprofessional moment #1.    Then i heard her tell some old man, we shall call Mr Fridays, I tried to get your attn before they sat down so you can have these seats.  Humm I let it slide. Unprofessional moment #2. Then Mr Friday decides to tell me if I move he is taking my seat and there will b no table/seat switching in there.  We argue for a moment then some other server/bar tender say there is no seat saving in here and thatll b a $25 fee.  Unprofessional moment #3.  He proceeds to tattle to managment while the person who was to be our new server and the bar tender all stood over there taklking about us as if we were not there.  Basically saying they were going to refuse us service bc her little sugar daddy couldn't have my seat. Unprofessional moments #4-10. I wanted to stay and just hold the seats but my friends prefer service so we left.  Lets see if they like the letter to corporate, sounds like a case of discrimination to me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-11?start=80,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148

89,P. E.,"Riverdale, GA",0,1,,1.0,2014-02-23,"One star, because no stars is not an option.  This USED to be the only restaurant on Camp Creek I would step foot in, because it WAS the only one not filled with ghetto hood rats working there.  Past: Food was good, good customer service, polite staff/hostess, decent wait time; in general a pleasant experience.  Today: Not sure how the food is (more on that later), dismal customer service, RUDE hostess, atrocious wait times; horrible experience.  We arrived around 11:30 pm and had to ask around to figure where the hostess was. When I expressed, to the hostess, my desire to not sit in the back, near the restrooms (which is apparently zone two, and evidently I should know this) I was assured, in the rudest manner possible, that will ""definitely make the wait a lot longer."" When our number was called, we returned to her to be seated. She looked at us and just held up a single finger as if to say wait, for what I'm not sure, but her gesture/demeanor was extremely rude.  We were seated just after midnight where Mark, our server, was very nice but obviously very over worked. He took our drink and food order immediately, two waters took 25 minutes to arrive. When five different parties arrived long after us were already eating their food, we decided to give him five more minutes to bring our food before we would leave. We ended up leaving at 1:28 am, having received only two waters, no refills, and no food. That was over an hour after we had ordered without a single apology or explanation for the wait, in fact I think we only saw our server 2-3 times.  It is obvious that management at this location either doesn't have the balls or the knowledge to run this place effectively. With the number of patrons who frequent this establishment (I used to be one of them), corporate better find new management before all of these customers, shelling out good money for no good results, wise up and find somewhere else to go, I know I'm looking. Also, the longer this goes on, the harder it will be to change the mentality of the employees who have learned, falsely, that their blatant disrespect toward customers is acceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-11?start=80,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.2440000000000007
36,Jackie H.,"Atlanta, GA",316,419,286.0,3.0,2014-04-04,"Let me tell ya'll something.  Here it is:  Jack Daniels sauce.  As long as it is slathered on something I'll eat it.  They hit the jackpot with that sauce.  So I decided to stop at Friday's for some lunch.   I ordered the JD's chicken sandwich.  That thing was so on point, I can't even talk about it.  Okay, yes I can.  Grilled chicken cooked with the JD sauce, fried Cajun onion rings on the sandwich, lettuce, tomato, and BACON and cheese (please note the ingredients absolutely were not listed in any particular order of goodness).  That sandwich was bangin folks.  You need to try it.  I had to go to the bathroom to wash my hands after the meal because it got real at that table.   I'm gonna calm down now.  The service was good.  The nice lady was attentive and very kind.  Friday's is a chain, which you already know and I think the food beats out Applebee's and Chilli's.  I'm gonna give them 3.75 stars.   Sign up for their online program called Stripes and go ahead and get yourself a free appetizer.  Moreover, you earn points every time you dine with them. Get on it.   As I've said, the sandwich was great, but I want it to cost less than $9 and some change at lunch time.  If you get the burger prepare for over $10 on that one.  Too much.  Yet, I'll be back because Jack's got me wide open.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-11?start=40,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476

The next closest one is the airport and we all know you can't just post up in the airport. Anyhoo...the wait was ridiculous, which was to be expected for anything on the Camp Creek corridor. We realized that people were just sitting themselves in the bar area, including the tables around it. Luckily a manager walked by and said ""hey you guys have been here for a while, take a seat here."" #winning We ordered off of the 2 for $10 special they had going on and some drinks. Yall know that jack daniels sauce is fie (fire) right? My boyfriend had never had it and was in his own small piece of heaven. I was just about to leave our waitress a large tip because the runner mistakenly brought out boo the wrong food plate (he got a plate that should have cost him 10 more dollars for half that price) until she spilled ice cold water on me and my phone. Keep in mind it was like 45 degrees outside and she really didn't help me clean it up either...*cries*. I still tipped her because overall her service was good and that's just what you do...these people are making $2.13 an hour guys. Been there, done that, not pleasant when you work your butt off and the people don't tip. Urm.

My wife ordered an app as her meal while I ordered a lunch special. We made it clear the app was her meal. They brought her food out a full 10 minutes before mine. No one got that that was wrong. Then my food.. A BLT and salad. The BLT was awful. Very little bacon one strip torn in 2 placed on lettuce tomato and avacado on a half stale Italian roll very very lightly toasted . The bread had no butter and the bread had not been browned. A bad execution of a simple sandwich. The fries were stale and cold.

My fiancee got to eat her entire meal and felt bad that my night ended up in a McDonald's drive thru. I just wanted to take my boo out to eat... well she got to eat... anyways. Uncaring, insincere, grossly underwhelming... a very poor representative of the TGIF franchise. Never ever again.  We drove 30 minutes from Villa Rica and this is what I got? At the end, the cowardly manager ducked us and didn't even offer us a break. Then they wanted to charge me for the steak and ask me if I wanted it to go. F!@k you!!! I came to your restaurant, within operating hours, to sit and eat a steak...not take it home!!! Well... needless to say... we are never ever going back. We overheard 2 waitresses apologizing to their respective tables about how bad the management and kitchen are. Not just THAT NIGHT...but every night!!! I'm all set!!!

30,James B.,"Glendale, CA",3,79,,3.0,2015-10-15,"Pretty bad all around, but one or two bright spots. Went here on bike night, Carla was our waitress. We sat there at the bar waiting for a while because some of the bar staff didn't understand how to queue people who had been sitting there first. Whoever yelled loudest gets a drink. My brother and I ordered two long islands. Carla made them correctly the first time. Ordered another one by Erin; tasted weak and was half as full as the ones Carla made. No consistency in serving size. Sat there for a while and decided to order food. Went for two unlimited boneless wing orders. First off, do not order this. The first set of Jack Daniels came out hot for me, but half of then we're hard as rocks. Did not complain because they were supposedly unlimited. My brother's buffalo was cold like they has been ordered by someone else and left out. He asked for another set, or even for them to warm those up. At that time, I ordered another set of Jack Daniels since those were gone in three minutes. Waited 45 minutes for them to bring out my brother's next set. Another 15 before I just cancelled my next set - even though they were 'on the way'  An hour in between servings of an 'unlimited' wing order is ridiculous. I told them to just take off one and we'd leave. Possibly they need to have the woman propping up the door replaced with a rock and have her in the back cooking. At least the bar's service was decent, the drinks and food we received was edible and the place is clean, so they get three stars for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-11?start=40,2.56,2.56,2.56,2.1559999999999997,2.56

29,Brittany A.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",405,149,159.0,2.0,2015-12-21,"After our first interaction with this TGIFRIDAYS, The only reason why we would come back is because of one bartender and the Jack Daniels sauce. This place was PACKED, which I figured it would be, so I called ahead and asked to make reservations. Someone explain to me a restaurant that doesn't take reservations? Especially on the weekend? And told us it's a 15 minute wait. Considering how this is one of the few restaurants in the middle of booty-toot nowhere and we had a movie to see and ALL other restaurants around it had at least a 45 minute wait, we came. Hood rats united here, I even saw a Cadillac with hydraulics come to find some parking. Hoochie outfits and a verbal cat fight out in the parking lot.  Inside, there was some woman with a bad attitude  writing down people's names on a sheet of paper. We were waiting for over an hour after she took our names. So obviously there is no actual system, computer or otherwise, here. The busboys weren't cleaning the tables, people left and those tables stayed dirty for 15+ minutes. Um, where's the management? You don't see this line out the door?   While people who came in after us were getting tables and we were about to leave, a bartender actually came and grabbed us, saying there was plenty of room at the bar. And there was plenty of room, why didn't the hostess ask anyone if we wanted to sit at the bar? Anyway, the bartender we had I believe was Joseph? If not, he was tall, dark skinned, and very funny.  The food is mediocre for the price, but the drinks (and the bartender's entertainment) were very good. I guess the cooks (and the corporation) think they can get away with so-so food as long as it's slathered in Jack Daniels sauce. Let's face it, the sauce is tasty. If we are ever around there again and are hungry and really have a time constraint and the other restaurants have long wait lines...then we'll sidestep the hostess and go straight to the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-11?start=40,2.64,2.64,2.64,1.9920000000000002,2.64

When I asked the manager, Fred Brown, to discount my meal he looked at me as if I was speaking another language. I find it absolutely absurd for him to be in the customer service business.

Second round was alright but my mothers glass was replaced with a new drink and had something gross out the outside. The entire time the waitress has been darting off and different staff is bringing us our food. There were times when..we were waiting for food and couldn't recall what items. Towards the end we hadn't seen our waitress and after waiting 10mins for just my dads plate i asked for a to go drink and a box. I was then told i couldnt do that. I said why not? I was told that its because it's dine in only. Mind you i waited for my dads food and by then we were all ready to go. I get the drink but no ticket or the box. The waitress comes back to repeat what was said with much attitude.  I wasn't going to but decided to ask for the manager. She walks over and also says its dine in only.

We ended up at the Camp Creek location on Easter Sunday because we overlooked making lunch plans after church. Our first few choices (more quick and convenient) were all closed, so by default, we ended up there with our nine children and a 45 minute wait. First of all, I told them they didn't have to push tables together, just asked to seat us in the same area, and they still managed to push tables together for us. When we added a guest, making our total 12 people, they didn't bat an eye. They checked in with us at least three times, with a smile, assuring us they had an area ready for us as soon as the last guest sitting over there was finished eating. They seated us in about 30 minutes and we had the most pleasant waitress, Adrianna, who took our order right away. If she was mad about working on Easter, you wouldn't have guessed it. She was perky and friendly and even got on the same level as the kids as they ordered. She commended their ability to order quickly and noted that tables of twelve adults didn't order as clearly and quickly as they did. Even with kids shuffling around while the order was being prepared, she remembered everyone's meal once it came out. The food was fairly quick, for a busy holiday AND Sunday lunch, and it was all hot and delicious (except the salad, which was cold, of course). ;-) There was also a staff member walking around the tables and asking parents if he could share a piece of Easter candy with the kids. We had the best experience today!

Really? It's 65 degree outside & temp is dropping. Cocoa, Chris, & Mike, the mangers avoided proper communication as much as possible. The managers were not hands on whatsoever. Didn't assist with getting drinks, cleaning tables, etc. I will give kudos to Byron, the waiter.  He held down the the team as much possible. Shame on the the vice president of the restaurant if that truly was him enjoying his meal with family in the mist of the chaos of his establishment. I only hope he will address the issue behind closed doors. Not to mention they are still trying to charge a 18% gratuity, even though the party was broken into small groups & different waiters.

The area I was sitting was not her area but she took our table anyways, but it was hard to get her attention, she never refilled our drinks, and complained and continued to remind us that our table was not her area... she wasn't rude, just complained about what she couldn't control which was having to serve my table due to a communication error with the hosts who seated us in the first place.

The hostess who was nice but unfortunately works under bad leadership said the restaraunt is low on wait staff. Not sure why the manager has not hired new wait staff yet, speaking of the manager. As soon as he saw me his face looked pained, like how are you the manager and you looked pained to talk to someone!! Anyway, so I asked him why he did not have a waiter for the patio area and he said you can order at the bar and take the food outside and eat at the patio area, but who should have to do that at a restaraunt. Then I asked who is the Franchisee because I would like to speak to someone to rectify this because this is unacceptable(because it is) And he looked even more pained, and was like he is gonna get me the info and to take a seat. So my mom and I take a seat, then we see two ladies leaving and one said I need to talk to the manager and I asked the other lady what happened and she said the waiter waited on people who came after them first and they said they were going to Red Lobster instead. After that we got up and left and said we would meet them there. So my mom and I go to Red Lobster and we walk in and there is no hostess and ppl are sitting down in the front(I guess waiting to be seated) and we wait a good min and no hostess comes up so we leave. As we are walking out we run into the ladies from Fridays and we tell them basically Red Lobster sucks ass too regarding service and the restaraunt had an odor too so we were leaving. My mom and I ended up getting Panda Express and eating it in our car- which ended up being the BEST thing we ever did, because we weren't around anyone with a stank attitude and didn't have to tip a bad waiter.  I say all this to say that CAMP CREEK has SO MUCH POTENTIAL but does the bare minimum to get by regarding service at the restaurants up there and a much needed stop light in the middle of the road across from the Chic Fil A and the Wendy's and whats even worse is that the beautiful amazing black people that live over there DO NOTHING ABOUT THIS. WE NEED A TOWN HALL MEETING or to attend a CITY HALL meeting about Camp Creek because the people in this community should not have to leave to go to Midtown or Buckhead to get decent service. Also NO ONE SEEMS HAPPY at ANY of these restaurants but that is because people still go to camp creek to dine in knowing that the restaurants ain't shit! This restaraunt has 2 stars and I don't even think the owner cares. There is NO professionalism at these places and people put up with it. Not me though, I would rather eat in my car then pay to deal with bul shit and a stank manager. This was typed out of frustration so sorry if there are any typos lol.

This location in particular ALWAYS has something going on so you will usually have to wait on average about 30 minutes. Wednesday night is Bike Night and they flood the parking lot with their cool bikes. I like looking at them so it doesn't bother me. The earlier you come the better because people tend to lounge around laughing and talking. Friday night has a DJ in the bar area and the music is LOUD. Typically, the bar area is real festive and the dining area is more family friendly. Again, expect to wait. My food has always been consistent but one time my guest had an issue and I don't think it was handled well. The Manager was not apologetic or accommodating at all. A true accident, the server was cleaning the table next to us and dropped a container of ranch and it splashed all over my guest. The manager just wanted to provide a wet wipe only. Unacceptable. They ended up comping his meal but I didn't like that more wasn't offered upfront since their server was at fault. Because I like the atmosphere, I kept my rating at a 4 but I do think they need to take better care of their patrons. Really a 3.5 if it was an option",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-11,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
12,Sevron W.,"Saint Simons Island, GA",129,18,20.0,3.0,2017-09-29,Please see previous review. The dinning experience  end up well. Started off jacked up but our server was excellent! He made up for the slow service at the beginning! I will return to give TGIF a second chance before condemning  them. Inshallah!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-11,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
2,Miss B.,"Atlanta, GA",0,3,,1.0,2017-10-12,"Where do I start....  1. It should NEVER EVER EVERRRRRR take 20 minutes for a server to come to the table and greet you. 2. One should NEVER EVER EVERRRR be dining in a restaurant that has a band so loud that the server can't hear me placing my order. I should NOT here every word he's belting out from across the parking lot..... let alone once I'm inside and seated.  UNLESS YOU KNOW SIGN LANGUAGE, find another location to dine at. I won't even mention the food quality...but let's just say that's where the ONE star cane from.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-11,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
9,Ebonee B.,"DeSoto, TX",213,4,,1.0,2017-10-23,Me and a friend came here on a Monday night to watch the game and get the endless apps special . Instead of it being $12 dollars as advertised I was charged $16. Also my waiter took so long we only got to enjoy to orders of apps . We're there for the whole duration on the game . He also forgot our last  order. It was a waste of money and time. Very disappointed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-11,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
8,Alexis A.,"Atlanta, GA",103,3,,1.0,2017-10-31,"This place is TRASH!! We sat for over an hour well before close  & our food just came out an hour before they close....spoke to the manager on duty who did nothing or came past to check to see if we are okay after the first complaint. No drink refills , no silverware , no straws, NO GOOD SERVICE. Sad part about the entire ordeal is that we ALL WORK IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY & it took a lot for us to even bring it to their attention. Save your money & drive out your way to another Friday's because they ARE TRASH. P.S. they're were only 3 other tables in his section",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-11,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88
19,T H.,"Union City, GA",0,1,,1.0,2017-11-22,This establishment is awful!!!! The service is extremely slow. No customer service. On top of all this my bill came to $19.00 and they charged me $100.00. Then tells me I have to wait 3 business days to get it back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-11,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88
1,Rhonda M.,"Atlanta, GA",2,83,126.0,1.0,2017-12-10,"The ONLY Positive:  It only took a few minutes to find a parking spot. Negative:  EVERYTHING else!! This was the worst visit ever!  The appetizer took forever, she didn't bring all of sauces and it wasn't right.  By the time she brought the other two sauces, we didn't even need or want it.  I had to ask for napkins, water and clean utensils!! The food took so long I asked for to go boxes!  I had to get someone to get my waitress twice because she was so darn slow and it wasn't rven crowded today.  So needless to say, I left 0$ as a tip.  I don't pay for bad customer service!  I am extremely disappointed and will never return to that location ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-11,1.88,2.19,2.19,,2.0660000000000003
