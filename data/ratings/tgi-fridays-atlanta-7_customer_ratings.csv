21,Kent K.,"Kennesaw, GA",6,265,14.0,4.0,2014-02-16,"We have all had our fill of overpriced, tasteless airport food served by overworked, rushed airport servers. (There is plenty of that to be had at the Atlanta airport just like everywhere else).  This TGI Fridays location in the Atrium between the North and South Domestic terminals is definitely a cut above the rest when it comes to airport food and service. The food is ok, not as good as non-airport TGI Friday locations but much better than the alternatives at ATL if you are looking for a ""sit down"" restaurant with table service.  What really makes this TGI Fridays stand out is the service. Our server (Linda S.) was simply GREAT!!! She was pleasant, friendly, efficient and checked back with us just enough to keep our drinks filled without making us feel rushed.  I would recommend this TGI Fridays to anyone travelling through ATL looking for a relaxing sit down meal. The food will make you happy and the service will amaze you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-7?start=40,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416

That being said... We stopped in last weekend while waiting on our flight and, truly, the worst things I can say are that it took a little while to get our entrees and they forgot to bring a to go bowl for so so chips and salsa. Other than those tiny things we had the absolute best service I've ever been privileged to witness at a Friday's. Shannon was fantastically amazing! Everything a server should be. Not only that, but I am in loooove with the (new?) cheese sticks. Normally I peel the breading off of a luke warm, not even close to melty, string cheese snack stick and eat it just as I would a cold string cheese snack stick. These were not like that at all! Hot, gooey, melty goodness. They didn't even look like mozzarella sticks from the grocery store.

32,Eddie K.,"Winter Park, FL",22,10,2.0,5.0,2015-07-19,"I have eaten at a lot of Fridays in my life. A lot. And with every experience I thought there was something lacking. Maybe there wasn't enough cheese whiz on the potato shooters. Maybe the french fries needed another cup of bacon and chive magic sauce.  I never knew what the problem was... Until now. Tonight I had the opportunity to enjoy a lovely meal at a Friday's inside of the airport. On top of that, I was able to sit at a table that was no less than 4 inches from children who are screaming through the terminal, old women who were confused by the bright lights of airline travel, and seasoned travelers you got from A to B with no regard for anyone who may be enjoying a side of vegetables right next to their whirling Tumi attaché.

40,Angie B.,"Middleton, WI",0,10,2.0,1.0,2015-08-15,"At TGI Friday's in T terminal of the Atlanta airport, it's a team effort to provide the worst service possible. Team work starts at the hostess stand, where a minimum of 4 women meet each new customer. Does this mean you can choose where you want to sit? Well... ""I don't know if that table is in my section... I'll get back to you..."" Never. The 4 women meeting ceremony then forms into a human wall that keeps everything and everyone from passing at all cost (not even 5 polite ""excuse me please"" will phase them). Next, we move on to the six sigma certified  kitchen for a group texting session. If your meal has been specially selected to be heated (half our food was frigid), there is highly qualified food tester that tastes each hot meal that leaves the kitchen! But wait, there is more! Have you ever played musical waitresses? If not, this place is a MUST! You are not allowed to switch tables (from the 14 inch center bar table that can barely fit a drink an plate), but they will conveniently switch your waitress multiple times without notice. I am also convinced each of 30 waitresses are certified in torture, because they did an unbelievable job at making us starve, as we had to beg for our drinks and food (each item arrived in 30-40 minute intervals)... BOTTOM LINE... Im sure some of the idividual workers here may have some talent, but none of it can be found in the restaurant & service industry!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-7?start=20,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000005

27,Angela M.,"Tucker, GA",0,37,8.0,1.0,2015-10-26,"Our expectations were low, since this is an airport location, but WOW. If the servers were moving any slower, they'd be going backwards. After a 10 min wait, we finally got to order. They were out of salmon and miso wings - of course I wanted salmon. So I ordered the Chicken and Spinach sizzler on a regular plate. My friends ordered a French Dip and a Chicken and Cheese sizzler.  After another 15 minutes, the food arrived. The good? Fries. The fries on the french dip plate were perfect. That's the end of the good in this review.  My chicken and spinach with tomato and mozzarella salad did arrive as I requested, on a plate rather than sizzling. The tomato salad had been sitting in the fridge for AT LEAST 2 days. The tomatoes were wilted and the mozz was dry on the edges. The chicken breast was cooked beyond recognition. Dry, dry, dry and stringy. The spinach did appear to be freshly cooked, but it was void of all seasoning.  The Chicken with Cheese was also cooked beyond recognition. It was also bland and tasteless, but at least there was cheese.  The French Dip arrived on an untoasted, pale, soft bun. The meat was dark and dry around the edges - clearly it had been on the line alllll day. But as I said, the fries were perfect. Probably because they were the only thing cooked fresh.  We also had the ""9 ounce"" wine, which was about 6 oz. They were clearly underpouring, but at least they under poured every glass the same. I guess they figured we wouldn't notice if they were all the same? Yeah, NO.  The waiter was sweet, but slow and fairly clueless. I asked what the well vodka was and he said Grey Goose. LOL  Try Smirnoff, genius.  This store just does not care. They assume since it's the airport that they'll never see the customers again, as far as I can tell. Welp, we live here and pick people up often. We will never go there again.  We ended up dropping almost $100 for this trainwreck of a dinner.  I read bad reviews of the Brewhouse, which is why we went here. Guess you should just eat BEFORE you go to the airport. :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-7?start=20,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003

They have kind of a captive audience, and they know it! They were extremely slow, out of salmon and miso glaze. When we finally got our food, the chicken and french dip were overcoooked.

Requested medium rare burger was medium well, with bottom part of bun so soggy couldn't pick it up. Fries were refried, and not in the good French way. Iced tea was ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-7,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12

This place was not awful, but it wasn't particularly great either. Our server appeared to be pretty busy but was mindful of our timeline, which I super appreciated. Prices were standard airport ones. A cocktail was $10 (prices for drinks were not listed), and the quesadillas were $10. Expectations weren't very high for this chain restaurant, but it was conveniently located next to my gate. The food came out in a timely manner, and my boyfriend and I devoured the quesadillas before our server came back with plates. We were pretty hungry. Food was okay, but there was nothing that really stood out. Again, not an outstanding place I need to return to, but our experience was pleasant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-7,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
