30,Kevin T.,"Dexter, MI",251,476,1535.0,4.0,2014-12-07,"One of a handful of TGIFs at the Atlanta Airport, this one is typically less busy as the T Concourse is the smallest of the terminals.  Standard TGIF menu which is worth noting at its airport locations. Why? The menu prices are the same as at their regular non-airport ocations.  Simply put,  their prices are not inflated 30-40% like many eateries just because you're stuck inside the airport. The Grilled Chicken Cobb Salad I had was awesome. My work colleagues had burgers and sandwiches that looked as good as ever.  Great service by our waitress Wendy. In fact, all the folks working here are very friendly, great smiles and very welcoming.  Lots of choices for food among the terminals, but for the T Concourse, this location of Friday's is probably thr best place for all around quality, variety and great service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-9?start=20,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544

The service has always been reasonably quick, but largely inattentive to needy customers with plans to stay put for a while. They seem to be on a polite auto pilot set for those customers who are on a tight schedule, stopping in for one drink or a simple bite to eat.

I'm pretty sure some of the bubbles in their drinks were from dish washing detergent that wasn't adequately rinsed out.

Never greeted me, soon as she came to my table she gave me a list of things they were out of.  it was so many things that I  didn't know if to ask her to repeat it all again so I just went with the flow and told her thanks, but I didn't plan to order any of that anyways. I explained that I wasn't ready to order and she tells me, well its 5 mins to last call.  I work in the airport and know this location doesn't close until 11:30pm, so I found it strange that last call was at 10:45 and assumed she was talking about liquor sales.   She wasn't.  It was food.  You can buy liquor up to the minute they close.  I ordered some garlic parmesan wings, loaded mashed potatoes and some broccoli.  Sadly the mashed potatoes were the best part of the meal. The wings were fried extra hard, almost too hard to eat, but since they were still warm once i dipped them in the blue cheese, they became chew-able.   Also they are boneless wings.  This does not appear on the menu, so hopefully you read this review or your waitress will tell you. The steamed broccoli was ice cold.  Started to send it back, but her attitude was so dry, I'd only have been shooting myself in the foot.  My server, Rashida, never came to the table once to inquire if I needed/wanted anything.  I ultimately had to ask someone else to bring me a to go plate.  She finally shows up to the table and lays the check down and starts to walk away.  Again, didn't ask if everything was okay, or even if I'd like a to-go container, and I'm sure she didn't know someone else was bringing one to me.  I had a coupon for the entire month of July and it gives you three offers, one is a free lunch entree with the purchase of a regular price entree and two beverages, one is 20% off your entire food order, and thirdly,  a free dinner entree with the purchase of a regular entree and 2 beverages.   You can use each offer once throughout the entire month of July.   So please  tell me why this server that hasn't spoken ten words to me the entire meals, gets an attitude when I hand her the coupon and says, well you need to buy a drink.  Uh, no ma'me, I don't I'm using the 20% the food purchase coupon, she goes on to read it as if she's going to prove me wrong.  The next thing I know she's walking off, only to return a few mins later with a new receipt, and the offer scratched out off the coupon.  No apology, no, I was wrong, please accept my apology.  Nothing. Therefore I didn't feel bad about leaving an 8% tip to round my balance off.  After reading some of the other reviews, I guess there are multiple locations within the airport  I visited the location in the North Terminal before the security checkpoint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-9,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

19,Linds F.,"Long Island, NY",31,31,,3.0,2017-05-31,"I have to complimentJustin, who was the saving grace of this experience. I stopped in for what I assumed would be a quick bite while waiting for a flight.  Our flight boarded at 3:05 and we arrive to TGIs at 2:00 exactly. We were seated promptly and ordered our drinks. About 2:10 we put in our sandwich orders.  A half hour later our sandwiches still hadn't arrived and I was getting a bit worried.  Unfortunately we couldn't find our server to ask. Finally at 2:55 our sandwiches arrived.  I did have time to notice that the sides I ordered were incorrect but at that point I was too hungry to care. I didn't have time to enjoy it sadly, as we had to run.  Thanks to Justin for being friendly and engaging.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-9,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006

6,Sedara B.,"Soddy-Daisy, TN",21,24,49.0,3.0,2017-10-14,"Let's just say if you need to kill time, TGIFridays is a great place to do it. While our server was nice, the kitchen took forever getting our food out to us. It was insanely crowded (it was the airport so I do understand that), and the menu was considerably marked up.  Once the food got there (mind you we only ordered 2 appetizers) they were good, but 45 minutes was a long time to wait. 2 apps & 2 drinks cost over $30.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-9,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
4,Hudson G.,"Atlanta, GA",45,100,30.0,3.0,2017-10-19,Really the only full service restaurant on T that I am aware of on the Delta side. There is usually a wait for a table but the food and service are normally decent and it's a good place to sit down and dine if you have time on your hands. Unfortunate  that they don't offer charging for your devices as that would really be an added bonus.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-9,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007
14,Duane P.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,19,,1.0,2017-10-25,The service and food are bad.  Order turkey BLT and it's processed meat.  Took asking 4 servers and the manger 15 minutes to get us the check.  I'd rather go hungry than eat here again.  Others also had to wait and ask repeatedly for checks. This is an airport.  People have schedules!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-9,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007
2,Billy B.,"Soddy-Daisy, TN",13,117,53.0,3.0,2017-10-29,"This is the busiest Friday's I've ever been to. It makes sense because it's in the airport in Atlanta. Our server was spot-on. It's about how crazy busy it was in this one, she made sure we had everything we needed and drinks were refilled quickly.  The food was overpriced. Again, we're in Atlanta airport so I expect it to be. that didn't bother me because I haven't had TGI Fridays in a long time.  The food itself was okay. Very not offensive. but not toe curling good either. It was... ok. I probably won't have it again because the prices and ok flavor but it was good to have TGI Fridays again and in the airport.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-9,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006
1,Tim S.,"Alpharetta, GA",130,184,193.0,3.0,2017-12-10,"The food is pretty good, but you better not be in a rush to catch a flight because like with all things at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson airport, it's slow and mismanaged.  It took 50 minutes to get our main course and there were no customers waiting to be seated. Typically they want you in and out of the seat ASAP to turn customers and increase revenue. Apparently that's not the case with this restaurant.  Otherwise it's not too shabby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-9,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006

I mean, about 3 tablespoons of grease came out of the burger when it was picked up. Do not waste your money.

Also a restroom across from it which can be handy. There are about 3 places with outlets. 2 are by the end of the bar near the kitchen door. Beware there is some kitchen smells  by the end of the bar here, but nothing bad per say. You actually get used to them and they disappear for most. The staff doesn't notice it at all if you ask them. :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-9,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
