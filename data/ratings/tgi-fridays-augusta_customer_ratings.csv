4,ash r.,"Augusta, GA",97,82,100.0,3.0,2013-04-28,"Good happy hour specials. 5 dollar domestic pitchers, 3 dollar long islands, 3 dollars wells and more.  The food is your average sports bar/american food. The turkey burger and spinach flatbread are pretty good.  The wings are also good with the Jack Daniels sauce.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-augusta,,,,,
1,Kandis A.,"Augusta, GA",510,506,2921.0,4.0,2013-08-05,I have never had a bad experience at TGIFriday's. They have great food. I love their appetizers. I think I have tried most of them. My favorite is the fried green beans with the Wasabi ranch dipping sauce. Their entrees are pretty good too. I normally get some type of chicken dish. I also love their mashed potatoes. They are always having a special where you can get a 2 or 3 course meal for a really resonable price. They also have great desserts. I'm in love with the vanilla bean cheesecake. The wait staff is pretty consisent with serving and fulfilling your needs. This is a great restaurant all around!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-augusta,,,,,
6,P L.,"Augusta, GA",1,11,,2.0,2013-10-09,"The service was good, but why (I might ask) does all the food taste overcooked?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-augusta,,,,,
3,Kimberly Y.,"Radcliff, KY",44,1,,1.0,2014-07-27,"Worst service ever.  Took forever to get refills. And only after I asked for them and when I asked for more of anything had to ask twice before it finally came.  Thought that maybe she was just a new waitress so figured I would let manager know so that maybe she could retrain a little more. But the manager said "" I'm sorry she is one of our best servers can I give you a coupon to come back ?"" Are you serious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-augusta,,,,,
0,Paul F.,"North Augusta, SC",33,362,84.0,3.0,2014-08-05,"Took the boy and his friend.  Got two 10 dollar meals to split between the 3 of us.  Spinach bread, mozzarella sticks and then chicken strips for main.  Was a great night out.  A little slow to seat us - no hostess on the door !!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-augusta,,,,,
2,Erin F.,"Harrisburg, PA",8,2,,1.0,2014-09-24,"Not only was the service slow with only about 4 other tables in the restaurant but I got severe food poisoning from the chicken salad sandwich. When I called 2 days later, not only was the manager speechless, with a bunch of ""uhs"", ""umms"", and ""wells"", but when I asked for a refund she said that no one else had called to complain about food poisoning and that she could send me gift certificates in lieu of refund! Like I will ever eat at a Fridays ever again! I work in the restaurant industry and in a case such as this I was disturbed by the lack of effort to make my experience better and the disbelief the manager had for what I was saying.  Completely unacceptable!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-augusta,,,,,
