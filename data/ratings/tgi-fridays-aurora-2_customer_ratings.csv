18,Randall S.,"Aurora, CO",138,104,20.0,3.0,2012-04-02,"We stop in here every so often for a weekend lunch or dinner. Have never had bad food but sometimes service can be spotty. Last few times have been great and they have a healthier menu than some other chains of the same cuisine. Love the Jack Daniels salmon, surprisingly. And who can't like the sizzling skillets!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2,,,,,
6,Melanie S.,"Oakland, CA",45,150,1.0,3.0,2012-06-26,"About a million years ago, I used to work for a TGI Fridays. This was back when we had to wear at least 15 pieces of ""flair"" and I still have a bizarre collection of ridiculous buttons and tights from this experience. The restaurant deserves a star just for allowing their staff to dress somewhat normally now.  So I didn't eat at a Friday's for about 20 years. That's not completely true but the very few times I have eaten there in the last 20 years it's been under protest. But then I heard this rumor that Friday's wasn't too bad these days so one late afternoon after getting hot and dirty at the off leash dog park across the street, the family decided to give it a try.  You know what, Friday's isn't too bad these days. Their menu is still stupidly long - no one needs this many options and you know when a restaurant offers that much diversity it isn't going to do anything great. But they do have a few decent things. Their Jack Daniels grill is good and they've always done pasta fairly well. They seem to be able to cook meat to your requested temperature too which is a rarity for these types of restaurants. There is a good selection on the kid's menu and service is okay.  I would not recommend Fridays for a romantic evening out but for dinner or lunch with  the family, it's a decent choice. It is very inexpensive too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2,,,,,
13,J C.,"Denver, CO",0,17,,2.0,2012-07-05,"This is the 2nd time we've eaten here and I won't be back.  The service is marginal, the kitchen took over 20 minutes to make a cobb salad, and the potato skins, a Friday's staple, were bitter.  The fudge on the brownie for desert was grainy.  No wonder this place was quiet during the dinner hour. For the same cost, you can go a mile up Parker Rd to Cornerstar and have much better meals at places like Cheddars or the Dusty Boot steak house.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2,,,,,
15,Sarah P.,"Temecula, CA",101,293,23.0,4.0,2012-08-06,"We never have a problem getting a table here. The service has been great, and food up to par with other Fridays restaurants. Definitely nicer than the location by the Aurora mall",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2,,,,,
0,Steven S H C.,"Denver, CO",747,647,1876.0,4.0,2012-11-30,"Last nights visit to this location was my 5th or 6th within 2 month time. Since I am in the quest for trying to find that perfect chicken wings, I did order and paid close attention to the flavor and such.  Well.. not much I can tell you about the oven baked ones..  you can't order crispy.. and its about the same Franks Original Red Hot Sauce flavor.    Why am I giving whopping 4 stars? 1.  very clean and new and lots of TVs at the bar area.  Lot better than Old Chicago or Chillis nearby. 2.  very very friendly waitress, bartender and the hostess.. and the usual 2 stars for just being there..  I m coming back to watch the games, try the cheap happy hour food menu (limited but still good) and enjoy the attention from the serving staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2,,,,,
4,Megan A.,"Parker, CO",9,106,9.0,2.0,2013-04-14,"The food was quite good but the service was awful. Our server came to get our order and when we asked if they had certain shakes available she didn't answer. She just started recommending appetizers. When we asked about other things on the menu, she still avoided answering our questions and gave us more recommendations for things we weren't interested in. When she brought the shake to me, it was not the one I ordered. She didn't acknowledge this at all. She didn't return for a long time and seemed really impatient and flighty. She would seem engaged talking to us and then all of a sudden would walk away. The food was good and we enjoyed that. We didn't get drink refills and had to keep stopping other servers to ask for things like extra napkins. The dish I ordered, I'd had many times in the past and it always comes with a side sauce. It wasn't brought out with that this time. I asked if they had a side sauce and the waitress said ""Yes, it usually comes with that. Do you want it?"" Of course I do, that's why I'm asking about it! If I can get the food to go, I will go back because the food was ok. Otherwise, I'll just make sure that I don't sit in this server's section if we go back. I doubt we will. At the end of the meal, she was complaining to us about how she doesn't have a car and has to walk to the bus station because she doesn't live in that city. She spent a bit of time telling us about her life, but didn't have time for us before that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2,,,,,
12,Lisa H.,"Aurora, CO",0,4,1.0,1.0,2013-09-19,"The one star is for the food. I ordered the chicken strips and a ""signature margarita"" and am not happy.  Service was fast and good, but the chicken was chewy and my husbands steak was also less tab average. Overpriced food. This place is only good for a beer and appetizer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2,,,,,
11,Phung L.,"Aurora, CO",119,277,69.0,4.0,2013-10-02,Bar food is bar food and you don't come here expecting gourmet dishes. The reason why I like this place is because their happy hour menu has remained consistent while other places omit many of the popular items from theirs. Though not quite of a selection when it comes to beers to choose from on tap. Vanilla bean cheesecake is always amazing here and I simply cannot get enough of it!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2,,,,,
9,Chuck L.,"Placentia, CA",378,207,45.0,4.0,2014-04-18,"Some of us family members went for some appetizers and drinks, and our server was excellent! The only ding on the night was that they didn't have the beer that I ordered which they thought they did because they switched out the tap to something else. It was fine. I substituted for the Sam Adams Seasonal beer and it was good too. We ordered the tostada nachos and the Jack Daniels Sampler. Between the 6 of us, it wasn't enough appetizers, so we ordered the potato skins. The potato skins need to be thinned out a bit more, because it was super thick with a lot of potato still left on the skin, but the older folks at the table seemed to like it, so another pass there. But more than anything, the server who served us made our night, because of her excellent service. I've been to a lot of different TGIF's in different states, but this was a great experience. I'll be back when I'm in town again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2,,,,,
10,Tiffany B.,"Fort Collins, CO",178,11,7.0,3.0,2014-05-13,"Food was good, and my mango lemonade was awesome. I don't drink and it taste great.. Our server wasn't great though. She was in either in a bad mood or just didn't want to be there. She would drop something off without making eye contact and barley look at us. She pretty much avoided our table because she was so behind. Not sure if it was her fault but she did sit with the girls next to us and chat for awhile. Food was good and drinks. Service was horrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2,,,,,
1,David B.,"Salt Lake City, UT",94,313,539.0,4.0,2014-07-14,This has to be one of the better TGI Fridays. They make an excellent selection of drinks the food specials are vast and always changing. We spent two nights trying out different drinks different snacks and they did a great job of working to maximize our club member benefits. The one negative that saved them from getting a five star rating was there poor job of greeting and welcoming guests to the restaurant. Both nights we had to walk in and find our own server to seat us and the manager who came by was far from welcoming. The one time we asked the manager for some help it looked like we were bothering the person more than being served by them as part of their duties as a manager. So if you stick to the waitresses and bartenders you'll have a phenomenal evening with terrific food and outstanding drinks. Just remember you're going to have to seat yourself my friend.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2,,,,,
8,Travis S.,"Chelsea, Manhattan, NY",0,28,5.0,5.0,2014-07-22,"Judi is awesome!  I like how she remembered my name immediately.  There are not many late night spots in Aurora, but if you're looking for one consider this Fridays.  If Judi is working, then don't hesitate!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2,,,,,
5,Justin S.,"Aurora, CO",25,18,,4.0,2014-07-26,"Great atmosphere, not long of a wait, food was good other than the batter of the shrimp. Tasted very deep fried when eating them. Ultimate margarita was awesome! Definitely recommend that. I had the 6 oz sirloin which was cooked just as I asked and the dipping sauce was very yummy. All the staff I came in contract with were very nice and courteous. Would definitely go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2,,,,,
