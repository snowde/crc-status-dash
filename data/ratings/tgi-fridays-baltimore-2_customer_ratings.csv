37,Aida M.,"Baltimore, MD",145,25,19.0,4.0,2015-10-20,I enjoyed this visit to this location. The wait staff was prompt and the kitchen was quick as well. My food was delicious. This is a new location so the kinks are still getting worked  out. Great experience overall. The lunch service is good. Although you may not get the same menu specials this location is still good to visit. They have improved since opening.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-baltimore-2?start=40,2.384,2.384,2.384,2.384,2.384
35,William W.,"Baltimore, MD",5,1,,2.0,2015-10-25,"I have gone two Sundays in a row to see what the service was like. On the first visit, I took a seat next to the bar and ordered beer. First order was from the bar, second was from a server. There seemed to be confusion as to which tables had ordered what because I was brought a drink order and a food order that I hadn't ordered. A table next to me complained that their food was cold.   On the second visit, I ordered two beers and a food order, fried shrimp and spinach. Service appears to have improved, as I didn't have other people's orders brought to me. But service was kind of slow given how simple my food order was. Bar isn't pushing drinks, as my pint glass sat empty without any of the bar tenders asking if I wanted another. Also noticed that shift change was slow. The management has no clue on how to run a high overhead operation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-baltimore-2?start=40,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184

I will start with the negatives, the service is a little slow, but we were seated in a timely fashion it just took a while for the waitress to come to the table. Also, the food took longer than expected but the quality completely made up for it! The waitress was very polite, did have to remind her of little things, but it was great! Honestly, the best food I've had at a Friday's by far; from appetizer to main course. The drink was a little watered down I got the Red Bull shush.

I tried not to approach this dining experience with any prejudgment from other's reported ill encounters here. Unfortunately, I too walked away with a bad taste (pun intended) in my mouth.  Our party of four was seated in a small, tight booth right at the front door. When I asked our hostess for a more accommodating seating arrangement, she suggested there were no other seats available. TUH! We clearly saw plenty of other tables available. Perhaps she misunderstood my intentions. Shrugged this off.  We ordered 3 drinks... much to our disgust we received 1 drink that appeared to have a very tightly coiled (pubic-like) hair floating on top. *Barf* Our food came out cold, lethargic and well on its way to hospice care, displaying no signs of life. The nail in this old rusty coffin came by way of witnessing staff members fight in a wild, wild west saloon-style brawl in the exposed kitchen area. I guess the restaurant assigned police officer was unable to break up the melee in time. We scurried out in fear of our safety as I had my 8 year old son with me.

But, adding this location to the Friday's chain is a big mistake.  We waited for an extensive period for our soft drinks and appetizers. As we sat there, I watched the kitchen staff as they were preparing food. They all wore latex gloves that were a greasy, dirty,  unsanitized filthy mess. I watched them touch every surface within the kitchen, scratch their heads, noses, touch their clothing and then touch people's food. I was disgusted by this. The manager was also in the kitchen doing the same thing. I brought this to the attention of our server and expressed how this was very unsanitized and one of the reasons why people get sick. She then shared my concerns with the kitchen staff, who disregarded my concerns and continued as they were. Approximately 15 minutes later, the server brought out our food. I refused  my entree and the server as well as my family looked at me like I was crazy. However, I refuse to eat in such an establishment.

Party including myself was two people. We were immediately sat, at which time we sat for 10 minutes without being greeted and numerous wait staff and managers walking right past our table. After flagging down a waitress to ask who was our waiter, it took another five minutes for the waitstaff to figure out who was supposed to wait on our table, and for the waitress to come to the table. When she came to the table, she gave us a long drawn out story of how she was double sat, etc.. for a good two minutes. We ordered our appetizers, drink, and dinner in one go. When the appetizers came to the table, we had no silverware an was offered no appetizer plates. Since we ordered two appetizers, we had to push each appetizer across the table for sharing. Now lets move onto the food which was a nightmare. I ordered a salad and my mate ordered the chicken pasta. It took over 20 minutes for the waitress to come to the table with the wrong order. She brought the pasta and a burger that no one ordered. She took the burger back and said that the kitchen would make the salad. (Note:The pasta was dry) I waited over 20 minutes and still had no food. I had to request to speak to a manager who was clueless! He actually went behind the counter in the kitchen and attempted to make my salad to go at my request because it was getting late. The manager who made the salad never even came to the table to bring the salad, instead he had some random waiter drop off a pitiful salad on the table saying this was from the manager. our waitress never came back to the table after I called the manager over. I took a picture of the salad which was beyond a joke. It wasn't even what I ordered and the ingredients weren't consistent with the description on the menu. I took a picture of the salad in disbelief. I called yet another manager over to the table and asked him if he thought the salad in front of me was acceptable and if he would eat it. He hesitated and replied no, he wouldn't eat it. I asked why he thought it was acceptable to bring this salad out to a customer who has now waited over 30 minutes to eat and the restaurant wasn't busy ( ten tables or less seated in the dining room tops). I had to tell him that I didn't want the salad, or think that we should pay for the lousy service or food that they brought out. He told me that he was there to fix the multiple issues experienced at this location, then zero'd out our bill and we left.

We spoke to the manger and he redid our order, but the wings were cold and it was clear they reused some of the food (the marinara sauce had breading it before we ate anything from the redo order). I'm praying we don't get food poisoning. To top it off we waited over an hour for our food, our mojitos were way too sweet, and the bar area was extremely messy and dirty. Perhaps it's because we came in on 8:30 on a Thursday, but usually large chains are fairly reliable so it was surprising that this TGIF was so awful. My friend is so upset she going to contact the company.

The service at the bar was only OK. The bartender was friendly, but stretched thin so he was forgetful. I understand, I'm in a food service industry, so my issue isn't with him, but with the lack of staff and organization. There were MULTIPLE bartenders that night, but it still took us forever to get basic things - drinks and apps. We had to repeat our order 3 times. Then, when we asked for more marinara sauce for the mozz sticks, that literally took 10 minutes to come out. to make it up, our last round of drinks was on the house, which was very nice of him bc everything else was just ""eh"". So service gets two stars knocked off.  However, the food was typical of a Fridays - decent chain bar food. The drinks (a cosmo and a blue moon) were cool too. My cosmo was well made both times. And when we were ready to leave, the bartender was prompt with our bill.  I usually only come to this location when I have something to do at Coppin. I always go in knowing that service is spotty.

Long story: It was a slow Tuesday and I arrived at 3 just for the kids eat free special from 3-8. I called twice just to make sure and they said they were still running it. Cool. We get there at 3 and the waitress did not put our order in until 3:26. I know u may think ""that's not bad"" but imagine already knowing what you are going to eat and literally just sitting there for twenty minutes with a one year old who is constantly trying to get out the high chair. Appetizer came at 3:50. I only ordered boneless buffalo wings and asked for blue cheese. They gave me ranch. So I asked for blue cheese and the waitress took like 5 min. Again, you may think it's not that bad, but she came to the table twice and did not bring the blue cheese. At this point I'm thinking to myself ""did I ask her to bring me blue cheese"".  Finally the blue cheese arrives and I can eat it with my cold boneless buffalo wings. So around 4 our food comes out. I'm smashing on a salad because I'm trying to eat healthy when I realize my company is not eating their food. They asked for the burger to be well done and it was pink inside. The waitress comes back and we tell them the burger is not well done and my sons food is not out. I'm so used to sharing my food with my son that I forgot I ordered him his own meal which got me thinking to myself ""did I place his order"" anyway the wait for that was long again because my company decided to just cancel the burger and collect the check.  The burger and kids meal was on the bill. The waitress said she was going to bring over the manager to take off the burger we sent back. While the manager was there we asked about the kids special and she said ""we not running that anymore"". I tell her we called twice and she says sorry but that actually ended yesterday. HOW DID IT END YESTERDAY IF YESTERDAY WAS MONDAY?! I mean she wasn't even looking us in the face so that's why I got upset, just disrespectful. She didn't even try to offer a discount or anything. She said I think Mike answered the phone I'll speak to Mike. Okay is Mike gonna pay our meal though, hell, let me speak to Mike! Like the banner was still up. So we are walking out at 4:40 and 3 employees are smoking outside. Like as soon as you open the door and one says they ain't give u a bag. We said no and kept it moving because there was no way in hell I was going back in there.  People always said the service wasn't all that but I like to support my community, but nah.

Normally, I don't go to chains because the quality of food is subpar, but my boyfriend really likes their Cajun Chicken and Shrimp pasta without the chicken and shrimp(he's vegetarian). It's $17.99 regardless of if you get the meat or not. He requested extra pasta in exchange for no meat and they WOULD NOT accommodate that. The staff wouldn't even give breadsticks free of charge!!!! $17.99 for pasta without any meat...that is ridiculous and because he is starving...he gave it a try. The pasta looked like a half portion and it was super bland and oily(see pic); he ended up throwing it away. The manager or owner needs to review this situation for sure.

We order vegan burger(which was burnt, sent back, and still burnt the second time) Friday's combo that had cold Buffalo wings. Grilled salmon that was burnt and jasmine rice (that was brown with tomatoes in it?) sent that back and didn't want anything else. And a Caesar salad that came out as a garden salad with Caesar dressing sent that back and got a real Caesar salad. Everything that calendar out of the kitchen was incorrect. Talked to a supervisor who said he would take the salmon off the check (he didn't) then talked to the AGM who told us taking an item off the check doesn't solve a problem in his opinion but while we were talking to him we got our incorrect check we asked him to fix and what did he do?
