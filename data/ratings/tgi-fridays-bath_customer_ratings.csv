0,Beki A.,"Manchester, United Kingdom",99,171,186,5.0,2016-04-01,Great lunch here using up some vouchers from EON rewards. Speedy service with a smile from the beginning!  Plumped for a bottomless coke and a hot dog with sweet potato chips- tasty!! Food came really quickly and was so tasty when it arrived! Only thing was I had to ask for a plate as it was served in a trendy bowl which I couldn't actually get my hot dog out of!  Pickles etc on top of the Hot dog were really great and didn't cost the earth.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bath,,,,,
