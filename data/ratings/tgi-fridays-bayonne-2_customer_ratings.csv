1,D D.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,18,,1.0,2013-09-06,HORRIBLE SERVICE. Very immature staff. Especially when you first walk in.  And waiters just seem to be inexperienced. The bartenders have fun while the bar area is a mess.   I'll pass. Back to Houlihan's for me and my family.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne-2,,,,,

The hostes was not happy to see us. She didn't even acknowledge our presence.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne-2,,,,,
