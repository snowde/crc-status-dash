107,Angelo w.,"Chicago, IL",0,9,,1.0,2012-01-07,"Worst place ever. Lets start off with the most  annoying song in the entire world. if that birthday song was sung one more time: i was going to ask for a gun to shoot  myself. secondly, the food SUCKED. 2 small burgers on buns that way too sweet. my burger was the ""southwest burger"". It was supposed to have pepper jack, avocado,spicy onion strips, onions , and tomato. The worst were the spicy onion strips, because they were soggy and dripping with oil. The pepper jack cheese was just gross. all the other toppings were okay. The fries were are a very big sticking point for me for two reasons: the portion size and they were covered in salt and pepper. You get more fries in a small order at McDonald's, and they taste way better. not to mention the ridiculous amount of salt and pepper. The price was ridiculous 9.39 for a burger: i would at least expect for it to come with a drink, but no 3 dollars for a coke, i love coke but for three dollars c'mon that's just stupid expensive. However, while this place is a crap shack it has one redeeming quality: the waiter was actually good. Otherwise avoid this place like the plague",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bedford-park?start=100,2.372,2.372,2.372,2.372,2.372

Over $8 for a shitty 20 oz. beer?!? Hell no.  It was REALLY crowded really early, and freakishly loud. I had a hard time hearing my girlfriend who was sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with me at the bar.  The service was OK, but really airheaded. I mean, I ordered some spicy boneless chicken wings with bleu cheese. When she finished getting the order, she asked me if I wanted ranch or bleu cheese. She came back a second later to ask if I wanted boneless or bone-in wings. A few seconds after that, she asked what level of spice I wanted. Seriously, three options, and she had to check each one. Oy. The wings were actually pretty good, which kept this from being a 1-star review.

My pot stickers and Korean tacos were not only interesting and quite a departure from former choices there but very flavorful as well. The bf was quite happy with his wedge salad but found the Parmesan crusted flounder to be delicious.  The only problems with the meal were that the sides came out not as ordered and the main courses came out quite far apart, time-wise.  We seem to be adding Fridays as a choice in our repertoire, even though we've both been kinda against most of these type of chain restaurants. 3 1/2 stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bedford-park?start=80,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7

86,Gerardo A.,"Chicago, IL",6,52,,2.0,2012-06-11,"I drove my uncle (Tio) to Midway on Saturday night and in order to kill some time, we went to TGI Friday's.  The food wasn't bad.  We actually liked our meal, which was a turkey, ham and cheese sandwich and a cobb salad.  Here are the reasons why I am giving this establishment a 2-star rating.  First, our server, who was a nice kid, never offered us any water.  He pushed strawberry lemonade on us.  It was good, however, my uncle is diabetic.  Second, when I told my waiter that I had food allergies, he gave me a menu that indicates every dish and every allergen.  I thought the bread would have been made with eggs, so I asked for wheat bread.  They don't serve wheat bread.  WTF.  How can an established chain of processed food (heart attack on a plate, LOL) and institutionalized cooking NOT have wheat bread.  I don't think they even have any breads for gluten-free diets.  What's up with that?  LOL.  Lastly, and honestly, I don't want to sound like a snob, but this location seems to attract people who just don't have any couth.  Honestly, I was floored and astonished at the conduct of many of the patrons ... very young and immature ...

99,Frederick K.,"Orleans, MA",0,56,,2.0,2012-06-21,"June 14, 2012 - Dinner At this complex of hotels for Midway Airport there are 3 restaurants, one of which was TGI.  I wasn't wild about going to any of them, but this looked like the least of the not so good food. DRINKS: The Beefeaters Martinis were good and made with optional blue cheese stuffed olives.  That's on the plus side. APPETIZER: Ordered boneless buffalo wings.  They were good, no complaints. MEAL: I ordered their top of the line Jack Daniels Rib Eye steak.  Mediocre at best.  It was tough, thin and flavorless.  One of the poorer steaks I have had on the road.  It came with two sides and I took two sides of broccoli.  The broccoli was nearly raw, maybe blanched but very difficult to eat.  I don't like it over done, that's worst, but 5 minutes in a steamer is about right.  I did not finish the meat or the broccoli. SERVICE: Sat at the bar and bartenders were attentive.  Service was prompt, everything was good. QUALITY: Meats are not up to par, next time I'll stick with the hamburger. ATMOSPHERE: On a Thursday night the place was busy and I like that.  I hate sitting in a restaurant with just 4-5 people.  This was okay, it's predictable Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bedford-park?start=100,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006
96,Mike R.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,,1.0,2012-08-04,"Unfortunately the Midway Hotel Complex has very limited choices on places to eat when staying at a hotel there, so I went to the TGI Fridays for dinner since it was across the parking lot. What a Mistake. I was greeted by a very friendly hostess who showed me to my table this favorable impression quickly faded. As I was sitting at my table there were numerous employees back and forth but no one came to my table. After 8 minutes my waiter walked by and said "" I'll be with you in a minute"", then almost 5 minutes later stopped by and tried to sell me some cocktail special without even asking me what I would like to drink. I ordered a beer and he left, so I started looking at the menu, I wasn't hungry for a big meal so I saw this ""NEW"" triple deck Reuben, the description said it had horseradish sauce on each of the layers along with the usual sauerkraut and swiss...that sounded interesting so when I finally got my beer I ordered the Reuben. I asked if I could get something else instead of fries since I am not into fried foods and I was told the only substitution would be chips, no salad or fruit. I took the chips. When my food arrived the chips were deep fried potato slices oozing grease and cold. The first bite of my Reuben was overwhelmed by the greasy buttery oil used to toast bread on a grill. There was no hint of Horseradish. I looked for my waiter and he was not to be found (the place wasn't busy at all) so I asked the busboy to get him. When he came, I asked him about the horseradish and he told me they were out so it wasn't on the sandwich (this was the primary reason I ordered it in the first place!) I asked for the manager and when he showed up I asked if my waiter was new, he wasn't. I told the manager about the length of time it took to get served and the lack of concern about the quality of food. I suggested that if the ingredients weren't available for an item the staff should know and it shouldn't be served. I suggested that retraining was in order and he told me he didn't think so! He dismissed me and walked away, then a few minutes later another beer showed up and I told my server I didn't order it and didn't want it (it was ""on the house"" to make up for the poor service and food. I didn't finish my meal as it was gross). I asked for the manager again and when he came over I asked if the restaurant was a franchise or corp unit and I asked for contact information. When my check arrived there was no charge and the phone number and contact name was written. There were no apologies, nothing. Because this restaurant has a ""captive audience"" and due to the lack of other eating places I guess they figure the quality of food and service doesn't matter because they are pretty much the only place and you get what they give you. I strongly recommend that if you stay in the Midway Hotel Complex, DON'T eat here. Go to the McDonald's a few blocks away. You'll get better food and service for sure!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bedford-park?start=100,2.6280000000000006,2.6280000000000006,2.6280000000000006,2.6280000000000006,2.628000000000001

40,Damian P.,"Chicago, IL",607,701,1838.0,3.0,2013-01-07,"Unfortunately Hooters was full and this was the last resort, and can I stress that this was the LAST RESORT! Someone shoot me right now! What was I thinking?  Our waiter felt the need to pick up my phone because of its cover and said ""oh that's really cool"".  If this is any Indication to how this visit will be, ""OH LORD""!  Appetizers: hmmm cheese sticks seem burnt. I think it's the oil, but the green beans (fried) are not bad. Boneless chicken wings are pretty good and the sauces are decent. The only thing I didn't appreciate was the fact that I saw our waiter cleaning (pretending while he watched the Basketball game) and didn't care if he picked up food plates and still serve.  I do have to say that the customers seemed to of had a night off from Bellevue Mental Institution. I mean, I know no one knows one another, judging by the different themes that they are all bringing  to each table (but wow is there something in the water up in here). I refuse! These customers were really on something, and judging by the odor of THC (tetrahydracanabinol) I think its safe to say, its a definite hit.  The Black Bean burger tasted so much like a can of black beans, needed salt (and I NEVER salt my food), the fries were as limp as a gay man waiting to watch a bunch of woman streak the San Antonio Astrodome!  Seeing the workers all just doing their own thing and just watching the basketball game while ignoring customers was really disappointing. Not to mention the waiter putting us in a small 2 seat banquet. Just the most uncomfortable situation, but of course, we couldn't have a bigger table since it was just two of us. And mind you, I am far from being a size 30! Just not a good situation. I will not go on, but seeing as I asked a few people what their experiences were at the TGIF family, and many said the same thing, they lack a certain air of caring.

41,Phil M.,"Morelia, Mexico",0,3,,1.0,2016-09-26,"I have been to this location three times over the past few years. First time was great, second time was iffy, the third time was my last. When you walk into a place, and the first thing you see is a card on the table telling you the service is so excellent that after 10:00 pm they have to charge you an 18% gratuity, that tells me you don't want to be there for several reasons. I will only elaborate on two. The service and the food.  I was greeted at the door and offered seating at the bar or a high top. I asked for a regular table, and watched the hostess give whoever was at the door with her an eye roll. Minus five, right there. There were tables all over, and I had to be seated at a dirty two top... That never got wiped off. By the time my soup came with a spoon, I still had not been given a napkin or other silverware. I had to ask for it when my salad came.  I ordered a chicken club baguette to carry out and eat when I got back to my hotel room. I finished my soup and salad, and was brought my check along with the carry out box with my sandwich on a plate.  I was never asked if I wanted a refill on my soda. I was brought a check without the gratuity added, then another one with the gratuity added. I really should have asked to speak with the manager, but I try to be a little conscious of the fact that some folks might be having a bad day, so I didn't.  I also didn't appreciate hearing my waitress and a bus person complaining about another employee, and how she needed to go ""F"" herself.... An hour later the sandwich was inedible. It smelled bad, the bacon was undercooked, the chicken was dry and salty, the avocado was gross... I took one bite, started removing the nasty parts, and ended up with a low quality baguette. Needless to say, the garbage can got the whole mess. So... In closing... I realize that they probably have a tipping issue with their late night clientele, but regarding the imposed 18% gratuity, all I saw was an excuse for the waitstaff to slack off and get away with poor service.  I'll go somewhere else the next time I have to spend the night in the hotel next door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bedford-park?start=40,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.308,2.96

Our waitress was a kind lady with glasses that waited our table and got our drinks promptly water and cocktails. We placed our order for appetizers and entrees and two more drinks. The appetizers came out piping hot with the other drinks. The potato wedges were a bit dry but everything was great on our appetizer trio. Our food came and was hot as well, I ordered the parmasean crusted chicken with broccoli and mozzarella tomato salad. The chicken breast was small but well seasoned and the broccoli was okay.

Let me just throw out here as well, there is not one healthy option here on the menu. However, if you're like me and change it up a bit, then you're meal will not be too artery clogging as the rest. For one, you can order the burger green style (lettuce bun) which was great in my opinion. Anyway, our waiter was very nice and patient with my longer order listing what I didn't want with my burger and such. My meal came as expected, and I was very please with the quality and taste of it.

Remember when Fridays was all about the appetizers and hearty entrees?  Not any more.  I ordered the Mediterranean Shrimp Naan, and it was a let down.  Smallish wrap with no more than five medium-size shrimp, if even that many.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bedford-park,2.76,3.01,3.01,,2.9099999999999997

25,Jocelin L.,"Chicago, IL",42,69,81.0,2.0,2017-11-04,"I was pretty excited to come here, and every time I do the wait is so long we leave. But today Saturday we waited about 10 minutes which was great. Our server Jesus was super nice and attentive with us. He made my dinner here great. We ordered 2 bruschetta chicken pastas .. as far as I remember from 3 years ago at another TGI the pasta is angel hair, with little to no tomato sauce because it's not a tomato pasta.. and the chicken is supposed to be nice and grilled ! I loved this dish. The food came out and yeah, i was pretty disappointed. So much tomato sauce, the chicken was almost raw I didn't eat it. It was hard for such little pieces it's impossible to not cook it right. I'll stick to my other location at Rosemont.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bedford-park,2.52,2.99,2.99,,2.8020000000000005

34,Tina A.,"Crest Hill, IL",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-15,The service was horrible.  The waitress actually said that they were out of coffee. She didn't even know that she had to make coffee. You can imagine how everything else went. Turned out the waitress was NOT brand new. She had been there for at least two weeks! The manager was combative. I waited 20 minutes for a drink because the bartender was in the back. The manager actually asked me if there wasn't another staff member around to make it. How am I supposed to know?!  I asked for and was not given the store number. I called 1-800-Fridays and complained.

26,Devin G.,"Indianapolis, IN",175,4,,1.0,2018-01-01,"I recently ordered at this restaurant while I was staying at the courtyard Marriott yesterday. My lover and I wanted to order some food since it was the closest restaurant to us. We both ordered two steaks medium, and we asked for the steaks to be seasoned.  We went to pick our order only to find there was no seasoning on the steaks. The host was very nice and got the cooks to remake the steaks. The host brought the order to our hotel room, but the steaks were burned to a crisp. The host had them remade again, and the order was finally correct. We also were given a refund for the meal, but it over 2 hours for the order to be corrected. I can't say I would ever given this chain another dollar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bedford-park,2.32,2.97,2.97,,2.71
22,Rene G.,"Chicago, IL",53,167,117.0,2.0,2018-01-09,This place is going down. Waited for over 30 mins for a table when clearly 7-10 tables were empty. We were sat right around the corner from the bar where the booth was empty along with a few more. I asked the hostess which there were about 6. Why are so many needed when only half greet you and other just stand there? The answer was short staff in the kitchen.  Waitress was nice and we ordered our food and strip chips. kids food came out food and so did our appetizers yet no chips. Finally chips came and our dinner. I ordered steak and my wife the sizzling chicken with shrimp. It wasn't sizzling nor was it made like before. the cheese was on the bottom and chicken and shrimp places on top. Looked very bland and we did send it back. Went to bathroom which the door hasn't been fixed in years. approx 12 empty tables and once again a line of people waiting to be seated. I did mentioned to the staff that the restaurant was going down hill with the new evening manager which they agreed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bedford-park,2.36,2.96,2.96,,2.72
