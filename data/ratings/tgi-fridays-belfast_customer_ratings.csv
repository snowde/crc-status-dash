4,Emma B.,"Belfast, United Kingdom",31,422,1531.0,4.0,2015-05-11,"TGI Fridays is a lively quirky diner that serves a range of burgers, chicken, steak, fajitas, seafood and so on.  My favourite is probably the Jack Daniels chicken.  They also serve a range of appetisers - the loaded potato skins are lovely!  The cocktails are great also.  Word of warning though, when it's your birthday they tend to make a fuss of you in front of everyone so be ready for it!!  Look out for the cinema deal too where you get meals, drinks and Odeon cinema tickets.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-belfast,,,,,
6,Jamey C.,"Ashgill, United Kingdom",0,2,,1.0,2015-07-11,"This is a poor excuse of a T.G.I Friday's menu is lacking in variety of food options nothing like my local Buchanan street Glasgow, I can't fault the staff they were superb and friendly, the food also lacked in presentation and volume and colour nothing like Glasgow once again so onto the burger i ordered today the cheese on my cheese and bacon burger was a few grated bits of cheese as if out a packet with a tiny rasher of bacon to top it, I wasn't the only one disappointed as a family of five of us dined here tonight ranging from 47 to 13 all let down miserably by this experience, one of us ordered the 7oz steak well done instead he was served with a very extra rare steak with a pool of blood after a complaint management apologised for they're mistake and refunded the steak along with 2 free cocktails for our next visit, once finished I spoke to the manager telling him of TGI Fridays in Glasgow and the extensive menu he then told me that they had an extensive menu until TGIs cut it down to a very limited range, shame as this has effected both customers and atmosphere, as I've said the staff were great but I don't go to TGIs for the staff more the food and on this I would steer clear of TGIs next time I'm in Belfast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-belfast,,,,,
3,Ciara S.,"Belfast, United Kingdom",824,753,6097.0,2.0,2015-09-30,"I'm not a fan of TGI Fridays. Tasteless, bland, processed food which is over priced for such a low standard. There are better restaurants in Victoria Square than this uninspired American Diner...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-belfast,,,,,
1,Andy M.,"Bangor, United Kingdom",50,36,95.0,2.0,2016-01-05,I think TGI Fridays gets all the credit due to being such a big chain. I personally don't see the hype about it.  You can eat in local restaurants for far better quality and just the same price wise. Don't get me wrong the food isn't bad but it's just very mediocre. The staff are very good and do everything they can to help you and the service was quick despite being very busy. Which maybe isn't a great sign either.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-belfast,,,,,
5,Noel D.,"Belfast, United Kingdom",5,31,3.0,4.0,2016-02-15,"Start off by making sure you have room for a TGI Sundae, they're amazing and could be shared between two. A wide variety or cocktails alcoholic and virgin to hit the spot. My favourite meal from TGIs is the sizzling chicken fajitas. Fresh vegetables, delicious sour cream and guacamole with chicken perfectly cooked. Recently portion size has decreased so no longer worth five stars but still worth a try to newbies.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-belfast,,,,,
2,Christine S.,"Belfast, United Kingdom",58,511,849.0,2.0,2016-03-07,"Good points: they have a good menu choice and the interior is nice and spacious. Unfortunately the standard of the food is just average, but the price is extortionate. Definitely not worth it. Both times I visited, the service was average. Won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-belfast,,,,,
0,Caoimhe M.,"Belfast, United Kingdom",39,92,447.0,4.0,2016-08-10,"Tgi's is a worldwide chain restaurant. My first time trying their food was in New York & I was sold. When it came to Belfast I was over the moon. Belfast's version doesn't quite hit the same spot as New York but it is still dependable if you want some American comfort food. The decor is quite funky with lots of old toys and records on the wall making it really colourful. Staff are friendly and quick to give you their attention and introduce themselves. I visited with my two young nieces and they were delighted to be given some colouring in packs and crayons to keep them busy whilst their food was being cooked. The kids menu is your normal burgers, hot dogs, fish fingers etc.  The cocktail list here is pretty extensive and includes mocktails which is always nice to see when you want something other than a soda. I chose a raspberry, mint, elderflower, rose & soda concoction which I can't remember the name of but it was really refreshing and fruity.  For my main I had their Jack Daniels sesame chicken starter as a main with a side of sweet potato fries. The JD sauce is sticky sweet and tangy with a very light flavour of JD.  It's really good, although too much would be quite sickening. It can be found throughout their menu and seems to be their signature sauce. The sweet potato fries are perfect here, fresh, crisp and piled high.  We were sat around a raised round table which was quite uncomfortable due to its height and felt quite cramped. It was also very stuffy in the restaurant and some air con wouldn't go a miss on the few days the sun comes out to play. They have a lift for wheelchair access. It's pretty slow and noisy but does the trick. Overall this is a good place for families or a group of friends to catchup over cocktails and diner style food at decent prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-belfast,,,,,
