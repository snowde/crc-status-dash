45,Tasey V.,"Baltimore, MD",0,96,4.0,2.0,2012-07-16,"Standard chain store, standard TGI's. My family and I went to this location the night my husband and I arrived in town, mostly due to how close it is to my mother's home and b/c we didn't want to have the wait associated with most places on a Saturday evening. Waitstaff was great- friendly, attentive, and quick to fill emptied water glasses, etc.  Food is AWFUL. We ordered a few appetizers due to having been on planes all day and basically not eating much in the past day. My husband wanted to try fried green beans- they tasted like dirt and were dry beyond compare. I don't know why TGI's decided to offer this dish- no matter how great the frying would be, it tasted awful. I was very hopeful for my entree- Mediterranean chicken kabobs served with pita and tzatziki. What arrived was again super dry chicken, black burnt onions (the only vegetable on the kabob), and cucumber water. If you know tzatziki, it is a pureed greek yogurt dip with cucumbers and dill. This was literally chunks of cucumber sitting in milky water. The pitas were soggy- the one thing that was supposed to be dry on the plate was wet.  Everyone in our party's food was the same- mediocre at best. Even for a chain store, I would have expected better due to QC. I would wholeheartedly advise people to either avoid this place like the plague or stick to things on the menu that have been there for years, b/c their new excursions are not faring so well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethel-park?start=40,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005
7,Darren W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2949,1450,4662.0,3.0,2012-10-21,"Eh, perhaps I'm coming to my senses in regards to this chain. I gave the TGI Friday's in Robinson an honest-to-God 4 star review since I truly did like all that I had. However, my dining experience today at this South Hills location was not outstandingly good or bad.  I remember having the Sesame Jack Chicken Strips at the West-of-Pittsburgh franchise and for some reason liked them more there. Not that these were inedible at all. They had crunch for days and days and the jet-black sauce was syrupy and appropriately alcoholic, but the chicken itself merely whimpered in terms of flavor. I felt as if I was eating a batch of Chick-fil-A's Nuggets upratcheted mischievously by Alton Brown and nothing more.  A half-rack of the Jack Daniel's Ribs served as my main course, and while they pulled from the bone fairly easily, the slab itself was lacking in meatiness. The same drunken, sticky sauce that I dipped the chicken into coated the ribs but failed to elevate them above mediocre.  The side of ginger-lime slaw merely tasted like undressed shredded lettuce. Where was the dressing? The french fries, on the other hand, were sticks of salted, hot-fat perfection.  Our very shareable dessert, the Salted Caramel Cake, was probably the peak of our late lunch. Flakes of shrapnel made of hardened caramel were embedded in a vanilla ice cream that flanked cuts of a vanilla pudding cake mortared with more crispy caramel and embellished with even more caramel in liquid form. Whew! Briny, granular, milky, and rich all at once, this is a dessert I feel could hold steady with anything offered at a more prestigious restaurant.  Micah, our waiter, did an excellent job, so no issues were had by us there.  TGI Friday's gets an unduly negative rap from the foodie crowd, but rate them more than average this time around I cannot and will not. Are my tastes becoming more refined? I really have not a clue. I just know what tastes good to me and what doesn't. Today, I found TGIF's fare to be mostly mundane.  I wonder if I'll rate the next one I go to a 2 or a 1. P.S. We came around mid-afternoon and didn't find the place at all ""loud"" as one drive-by reviewer put it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethel-park?start=20,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668

I can't ignore how good my most recent experience was.

They weren't as good as Edgar's in the strip, or Pgh Taco Truck but they were close.  Pretty darn good for a chain! Other standard items like buffalo chicken tenders, a strawberry salad, cobb salad were also good.  The cobb salad has been ""updated"" and isn't as good as it used to be here.

But this place is just overall terrible.  I travel constantly and I know what to expect from all chains, both in the 'burbs, and in the cities - but this place was just awful. I waited almost 15 minutes (late at night, empty bar) to have my order taken, and the food seemed to have been heat-lamped for several hours prior. I don't expect much at a TG's, ever, but this place fell short even within that mental framework. Just avoid it and try to get to Bonefish Grill down the street if at all possible.

You can purchase a meal with an appetizer for $14, which can save you money, but overall I think that the food isn't worth the $12+ price for most items. The spinach artichoke dip is very good and they give you a lot of chips, which is nice because you don't have to ask them to refill it. The service was pretty good, although the hostess didn't direct me as to where my party would be, and I had to attempt to find them myself. The layout of the place is a little confusing and I walked all around the bar before I could find my party! Overall, I'd probably go to this particular Fridays again, but it wouldn't be my first choice.

5,Marla K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",100,90,37.0,2.0,2014-11-16,"So I'm not sure what's happened with T.G.I Fridays over the past few years but the prices have increased A LOT and the food quality has gone downhill.  My husband and I stopped here for dinner after a long day of running errands. It was about 9:30 on a week night so there were only about 2 or 3 people working. When we saw how much the prices had gone up on the menu we considered going somewhere else, but we were starving and figured the food would be really good so we stayed.  I got a burger with sweet potato fries...that cost $13! And a margarita. The margarita was good. The burger was just okay. And there were only about 12 sweet potato fries on my plate. I think this cost an extra $1.50, so you think they could have give me a few more. The food wasn't bad, but when I'm paying that price I expect it to be awesome...which it wasn't. The waitstaff at this location were all very friendly. It's just the combination of high prices and mediocre food that make me think my days of going to Friday's are over.

A warm, breezy, 71 degrees demanded sitting on patio. The daily drink special persuaded me to order a Long Island Ice Tea, and man, was it potent. The only reason (other than self control) that I've never been drunk, is I never drink on an empty stomach. This LIIT was kick-you-in-your-butt potent. Geez, you'd think the bartender was my BF. Thank God for the granola bar I always carry. Dave, my server, was GREAT. Fun, postive, polite, fun, professional. Had nothing but nice things to say about my other favorite server, Kim. That's class! I'm open to suggestions, so Dave suggested the Sizzlin' Shrimp & Chicken. It arrived piping hot, with two tidy mounds of creamy potatoes, topped with fresh, chopped scallions. The six small shrimp, peeking from under the chicken, were still in their shells! This was not a welcome surprise, and I asked Dave about that. He said he too, was surprised, and they shouldn't have had shells. The manager stopped a minute later, and apologized. He used to instruct his chefs to remove the shells, but then corporate ordered the shells left on. He comped my LIIT, though I asked for nothing, and asked me to make sure on future visits to ask for him personally if I needed anything.

Basically, you can go in here and get a satisfying meal or you can go in here and get a crappy factory meal.  Again, it really depends on the daily staff.  As you know, TGI Fridays is not a ""destination"" restaurant.  It's the place you go when you want a quick tasty meal when you are shopping or don't want to cook or don't want to spend your entire paycheck.  It is what it is.  This specific branch however is not consistent in quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethel-park?start=20,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8

23,Eryn P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",196,91,183.0,2.0,2017-03-14,"Usually chains are completely reliable when it comes to the identical stellar service or food they provide.  TGI Fridays seems to have the opposite in the bag. They are always reliable for bad service and cold, sad food.  Yesterday was the same consistency that I've had at this location before. I was there with my family, Mom and Dad, and my Brother and his wife. We all ordered the unlimited apps for $10. Don't get me wrong, $10 all you can eat apps is a great price point, if you accompany it with good food. This is where Friday's misses the mark.  Johnny (I think) was our server, and he mumbled through his greet, and struggled to remember if they served sweet tea. We got our first rounds of apps, my brother and I both ordering wings. They were both cold, and the amount of ranch that was brought to the table was less than enough for two or three of their boneless wings.    Second round; Mom got meatballs. They came with little cute garlic bread slices, that didn't taste like anything. The meatballs were swimming in (admittedly, really good) sauce, with just a touch of cheese. Third round, my sister in law got the same thing; and it was completely opposite. There was so much cheese and so little sauce, we thought they brought something different.  I literally work directly across the street from here, and we've been here on corporate days for lunch for their speedy lunch, but it's always slow and unpredictable. If this place worked on their consistency, it would be great. Their menu would be good if the consistency was there, too. The ideas on there are great! Good savings for happy hour and this app special. If I could just know that it would be good, each time.  I hope they get their acts together, I wouldn't mind coming here more often.  Happy Eating, Just probably not here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethel-park,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
35,Sheri F.,"Bethel Park, PA",40,10,3.0,3.0,2017-03-22,"We eat at Fridays because of the rewards.  It's not the first place I think of going but if I have a buy one get one free dinner I'll go.  The past few visits the food has just been ok.  Our last visit my husband ordered french onion soup.  It never came so he asked twice about it.  Finally, after he finished his entire meal, it showed up.  He had a bowl of broth with two bread slices and very little cheese.  Not the oozing over the bowl cheese...just small amount on the bread.  NO ONIONS!  We had a free dinner because of our rewards and a free birthday dessert so I couldn't complain.  If we were paying full price for this meal I would have been super unhappy.  Don't bring us in on coupons then serve us a crappy dinner!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethel-park,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76

33,Jan M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",7,140,24.0,3.0,2017-07-04,"Our family stopped in for a quick dinner over the July 4th weekend, and the visit was a pleasant one, our server was great! Everyone was in the mood for meat, our server was Mya, she told us about the rib special, a whole rack for $12 or so, with the sides. My son's ears perked up, and his order was decided before we sat down in our booth. Steaks were cooked just as we requested (medium, and medium rare) which Mya had us cut into before she was off taking care of her other tables. Chicken Cesar salad was like the countless other ones ordered before, no complaints. The restaurant wasn't crowded at all, but did pick up while we were there. Mya was friendly, and on the move between her tables, doing whatever necessary to make sure everyone was happy. A better experience than we've had in the past. The cheddar mashed potatoes were good, a bit dry, and my broccoli was cooked well, not grey and deathly looking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethel-park,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

20,Kimberly T.,"Downtown, Pittsburgh, PA",735,645,2146.0,4.0,2017-09-18,"I was meeting a couple of friends for dinner.  I've been a lot no time customer of TGIFridays for many years.  One of the things I like about them is their Stripes reward program. My meal was free because I had points to redeem. They have quite a menu but one of my GoTo's is the Jack Daniel burger. It's a traditional burger which includes lettuce, tomato, and purple onion. It comes with a small cup of Jack Daniels sauce. That's a lot of goodness in that cup. I pour some on my burger and dip my fries in the leftover sauce. The sauce is sweet and smoky. The burgers are always juicy so have a napkin ready. Burgers come with  what I refer to as rustic fries. They are skinny and have some potato peel on them. They are a rough cut so they are different sizes, but always cooked nicely.  Good food at a good price is always nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethel-park,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76

21,Stef W.,"Monongahela, PA",35,84,49.0,1.0,2017-11-28,"Ugh where to begin. I hate writing bad reviews, but when you have to get your entire check refunded due to the horrible quality of the food and service, then I feel the need to share it.  First we made the mistake of coming here while a Steelers game was on, so naturally, everyone including the wait staff was more focused on the game than anything else. We saw our waiter one time throughout the night and the rest of the time he was standing there watching the TV, not even 20 feet from us.  Our drinks never got refilled.  My boyfriend ordered a 3 meat sampler plate which was not cheap- about 24 dollars I believe. It was advertised served with seasoned rice with mixed vegetables. My boyfriend asked them to hold the broccoli - I believe it was- and the waiter said no problem. When his food arrived, there was absolutely no rice or veggies- just three measly pieces of meat on a plate- Not even enough to satisfy one person as an appetizer. When my boyfriend asked what happened to his rice and the other vegetables, the waiter said that the broccoli was already mixed in with everything else, so instead of telling him that, they gave him nothing at all. The waiter didn't even offer him a different side dish. We were not paying full price for 3 TINY pieces of meat. Luckily the manager came over refunded the entire check. This is the last time we will go to this Friday's due to the seriously poor service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethel-park,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
