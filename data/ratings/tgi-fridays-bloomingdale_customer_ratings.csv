It's pretty much on the same level as a Chili's or Applebee's, but I find the quality of food is slightly better, the servers work harder, plus they have daily deals and the Stripes Rewards. If I'm looking for something above a fast food place but not a fancy sit-down either, this is where you'll find me. I like their steaks and I usually order a Mojito or a Mango Mai Tai. Definitely not the best, but not bad. And I'm really glad they do BINGO nights.

But I really do love that noise for some reason. Anywho. Friday's is one of those places that you can go to and you know you won't be disappointed, but you're not gonna be super stoked either. It's Friday's.  You should probably check out their new Yucatan chicken salad, it was pretty good. Use the lime they give you on it, it makes it. And you probably want to ask for extra avocado because I barely had any on my salad. Otherwise I typically order the dragon fire chicken, love the jasmine rice that comes with this. Drinks, I typically go with the Patron cosmo rita shaker. But they have new drinks pretty often so I'll try those every now and then.

But watery as it was, I poured it on my burger & it jus flowed thru my whole plate. It soaked up my stale burger bun & fries & added to the disappointment.

Here's what I got: French Onion (3.15): Good lord this bastard was salty. It looked really damn good (see picture) when I got it but when I uncovered the oozy cheese and crouton, there was this thick (and I mean maple syrup thick)  dark, syrupy substance in it with chunks of onion. It was basically a black gravy There is no way this is the standard recipe for tgi fridays. I probably got a rare f-up where they left a pot of french onion on and it condensed to this thick salty crap. It was WAY too salty, and this is coming from a guy that likes Ramen and olive garden. If you've had a similar experience, let me know so I can complain to their HQ.  I ended up using the soup as gravy for my mashed potatoes haha. It worked well.  Petite Steak: Cooked surprising well considering my appetizer, I asked for medium, I got a perfect pink medium. It comes with a dollop of this rich garlic butter. If you're into garlic, this little ball will make your meal. I even dipped my fries in it. I also asked for a side of Jack daniels sauce which I suspect has no Jack Daniels in it. It was very sweet and syrupy. (11.00) (See Picture) Comes with 2 sides:  I got the seasoned fries which were crispy and good, and the mashed potatoes which were also pretty darn good. Service was good, soup came in 15 minutes of sitting, Steak and sides came 15 minutes later.    Now unlike some chain hating snob faces on Yelp, I don't have some stupid bias against chain restaurants. I take them as they are: salty, consistent, and reasonably priced.  This was was no different with the weird exception of the soup. Would I come here again? Probably, but not unless I really had to.

44,Jennifer P.,"Addison, IL",385,946,2328.0,3.0,2014-04-05,"So, my +1 INSISTED on dining at either TGI Friday's or Chili's.  Being that this was the closer of the two, I begrudgingly obliged..   I was pretty shocked to see it so packed; then again, I think there was a game on AND they had $3 Long Islands.. As a pretty staunch ovo-pescetarian, I had a hard time finding seafood or veggie entrees on the menu.  That was pretty surprising to me that chains such as TGI's haven't caught up to the shift of the more health-conscious consumer. The only options that I could locate were seafood pasta or a Black Bean Burger, so I had the latter.  The burger was just OK - kind of flavorless. The burger itself crumbled apart, while the rest of the goop on top (sauce, pickles) slid off.  There was a point when half of my burger was so disassembled that I couldn't get it back together and resorted to eating it with a knife and fork.   Bleh. Our server, Brian, was nice and attentive, but seemed overwhelmed with the amount of tables he had to cover.  He did check on us while he was whizzing on by.  (And I hope my +1 gave him a good tip!)  I did have a gross green floater in my water glass, but he took care of it pretty promptly and apologized for it.  He was also good about getting refills to us without us having to ask.

30,Charlotte S.,"Addison, IL",156,140,180.0,3.0,2015-01-16,"Fridays is Fridays, so you can usually bank on it being consistent in delivery (for food, anyways). I've been coming here since I was a wee lass and am usually content with this location.     Service is usually average with the occasional meh server or great server (Daz. [I think that's the name] is usually really good).     Food is average, though I very much enjoy the chicken fingers and honey mustard. The seasoning on their fries used to be more which I liked but still, those are decent too. The sizzling chicken and shrimp is another good one, and the French onion is usually my go-to soup if I'm feeling soup.      Recent problem I've noticed: I don't know what is up with that girls bathroom (can't speak for the lads), but it's got quite the stank going. It kind of smells like a sewer issue, and was at first confined to the bathroom but I was actually starting to notice it by the tables nearby; however, last time I was in it smelled as if they were somehow trying to deal with it.     It's of course got the whole bar portion, mixed drinks can sometimes use some help but whatever. They've got all kinds of specials on drinks as well as food (including food/appetizer combos at a good price).     Hours are 11am-2am, so that is nice if you're looking for something later on.

80,Alex R.,"Winfield, IL",0,1,,1.0,2015-06-03,I decided to eat at the TGIF in Bloomingdale IL this afternoon and was extremely disappointed. I made sure to let the chef know that the food was terrible and I would not be coming back. As I am a cook at a Rock Bottom restaurant i felt I had to voice my opinion to him. The Steak I ordered to be cooked well done was definitely not. I suspect that they don't even check their meats by temperature as they should and have had complaints in the past seeing as how the waitress who brought my food had to ask me to cut the steak and check it. I choked on the macaroni I ordered as a side because whatever they put on top was overly heated and was visibly burnt. I could have just scraped off the topping and eaten the macaroni but I would have probably chipped a tooth and choked on that as well. It's one thing that one macaroni side was in that condition but my wife's was as well. I would go on with what was wrong with the food but I feel that who ever reads this will get the point. Extremely disappointed and will never eat at a TGIF ever again. I suggest you take your money somewhere else.

62,Johnny A.,"Saint Charles, IL",74,223,39.0,3.0,2016-09-16,"Just another update since my last review - came with family week of Labor Day. Let me get the major complaint out of the way FIRST, and we do realize this may not be specifically with THIS Friday's alone. ** Friday's Nachos (regular nachos) have been 'discontinued'.  Major bummer.  The Friday's Nachos have basically been a regular staple of the restaurant since literally the late 80's.  We asked a manager about this and he had no idea why, but that it had been finalized earlier in the year.  We actually contacted corporate with this question and have yet to receive an answer (I doubt we will).  They now have - instead - some type of ""chicken nachos"" for about 12.99.  General rule of thumb:  You don't fix something that isn't broken after almost three decades.  Also, if for some reason the 'regular nachos' were no longer doing well, it's highly doubtful the chicken nachos will suddenly fair better. - Our overall service was actually fantastic.  Our waiter (Bryan? African American guy) was being trained and he was beyond attentive, as was his trainer.  A+ on service tonight. - Food was very good.  Prices have gone up a tad on just about everything, but I guess this is to be expected. - One final note:  Over the years, the restaurant has obviously been remodeled MULTIPLE times.  We noticed the 2nd floor section (back of restaurant) now seemed to be painted/wall-papered with some very dull, plain, boring beige-ish /green-ish paint or wall-paper.  It's hard to explain unless you see it.  It was never that way before so this must have been recently done.  Just no vibe to it and it actually takes away from the upbeat atmosphere of that section now, almost brings you down if you keep looking at it - it is just so DRAB.  Again hard to explain, but whoever decided on THIS made a bad decision. Overall:  Good food, great service this time around.  Removing a classic staple from the menu (again probably not relegated to this Friday's alone) was a BAD MOVE, and some of the remodeling with this restaurant just is out in left field...   We will be back, but as stated in my previous reviews we only get here maybe 1-2 times a year on average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale?start=20,3.16,3.16,3.16,1.9320000000000002,3.1600000000000006

Our server was friendly and checked up on us frequently. Our waters and sodas were empty a couple times, but he did eventually notice it.  Overall, it was a nice casual place to dine. BUT, they didnt seem like they have a separate lunch menu, so lunch and dinner prices are the same. Maybe would go to a different restaurant nearby that has lunch specials for a better lunch deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
11,Aldo D.,"Schaumburg, IL",23,93,18.0,1.0,2017-08-03,"Probably the worst service I've ever received in years. The ""server"" (note the quotes) was arrogant and had a nasty attitude when I made a simple request for an extra side of sauce. When I explained to their manager about this guy I was told that someone else would ""deal with me."" Deal with me?!? Who the heck tells a customer that?!? Do you even WANT my business?!? Apparently not! I think I will spend my Friday's elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
71,Lana C.,"Wheaton, IL",101,94,98.0,2.0,2017-08-05,"I went here last night to have dinner with my cousin. Wait time was perfect. I wanted to order an ""endless appetizer"". Keep in mind there are only two of us. This server tells me that if I order an ""endless appetizer"" that I cannot share it and we both have to pay $10.00 each for an appetizer. So you are going to babysit me while I eat to make sure I don't share my appetizer with someone at my table? If this sounds reasonable to ANYONE on the planet then you should go live on mars! So instead I saved us the $20 and just ordered an appetizer... the potato skins. Man did they suck. No flavor at all. Tasted like cardboard. I ate two of them just to make sure they were as flavorless as I thought.  To add insult to injury, at least twice the food runners kept trying to serve out table appetizers that were not ours. This happened three times (not kidding). We saw mozzarella sticks, some kind of chicken wings, and some quesillias ... oh ya and some pot stickers .... Maybe other stuff I just stopped paying attention to the idiocy at that point. I followed up my order with the sizzling chicken and cheese. Once again ... a very bland dish. I was here a few weeks ago with another friend and my steak at the time tasted exactly like the chicken I had last night. How is that even possible? This place use to have excellent food. The prices have gone up and the quality is in the toilet. My guest had a coupon to use for a free burger but a point was made that the turkey burger was excluded from the coupon but the manager allowed the transaction anyway. Oh wow another rule ... like kindergarten? Management forces employees to repeat this ridiculousness to paying customers?  Two stars because our server was nice and part of his job is repeating these moronic guidelines, which he clearly felt were completely wack (you could tell by the look of shame he gave while explaining it) Food, stupid rules, and, micromanaging your customers (not your employees?) are going to be why this chain eventually disappears just like applebees and bakers square. Same review is on google. Go eat somewhere else. Olive Garden is down the street and they have free wine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale?start=20,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
6,Jessie W.,"Schaumburg, IL",117,1,1.0,1.0,2017-08-16,"Worst service I've ever had in a restaurant. Scott Griffith was the worst manager, not only did he not try to correct the mistakes made by his training server, he also did not offer help on the floor for our party of 10. When confronted about our service, he told my friend to let him manage his own store. ""If we had a problem there was manager job available if we could do better."" Our whole party was in complete shock with how he interacted with our group. Even the tables next to us who were listening to the conversation were amazed that he said what he did. Will never return. Update: After all that had happened we payed our bills and were singing happy birthday to my friend, getting ready to leave. While we were singing the manager approached us again and proceeded to kick us out of the restaurant. We were so furious but left on his terms, as we were walking a different server jumped in and got in my face. When we got outside that same server followed us outside and proceeded to throw an entire cup of water into my face. I am appalled by this situation, never in my life have I seen such service.

He dropped a gaze that spoke ulterior motives.. this was not to my appeal to which I then asked for my check.

Third try was also incorrect.. She never got her correct meal -the server SPILLED SALAD DRESSING ON MY FREND -2 friends ordered beer.. showed up AFTER the food -found bones in my salmon -vegan friend asked for no chicken in her pasta, there was chicken in her pasta  -after our meal the INITIAL replacement salad finally arrived and had a LONG BLACK HAIR in it  -ABSOLUTELY NOTHING on our bill was comped or discounted. We didn't even get an apology. I'm PISSED we had to pay for 100% for everything.  Our server avoided us for the rest of the night.

Service at this location has always been slow but it seems to have gotten slower some how. And there's no excuse when the restaurant is not busy. I guess this is one of those chains that has given up. One suggestion in the mean time, don't put people with no people skills in charge or in the position of hostess. If I was just grading them the place would get no stars. Sad to see. Most aren't as bad as this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08

I arrived 5 minutes after 2pm and was informed I'm ineligible as the offer ended exactly at 2pm. The front desk lady said this was based on the manager's orders. What kind of recognition is that? They couldn't be flexible by a few minutes? I went next door to Chili's, where not only were they much more welcoming, but their complimentary meal is offered all day and evening. I was even invited to come back again for a free dinner.  I'm avoiding TGIF in the future for this unnecessary stinginess, and will now happily become a regular Chili's customer.

They do not, and they only have a few options available for lunch portions which is a bummer when you're looking for adequate meal portions. There was only about a dozen people here around 1pm for lunch and unfortunately it was not great service. I only have an hour to kill for lunch and the majority of my time was spent waiting. Waiting to place the order, waiting for the food (took the longest especially when you're hungry) and then waiting for the check. The worst part was our waiter rang up our $7 meals for $9 dollars and then it seemed like he disappeared as we waited around to reconcile. We did not receive an itemized receipt when he rang us up so we had to ask for one of those first to figure out why our bill was so high. Thankfully upper management was very kind enough to let us pay the correct amount and the manger personally came over to apologize. Kudos to him!!
