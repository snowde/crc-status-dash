4,Kristine J.,"Phoenix, AZ",9,13,5.0,5.0,2012-04-09,"I go here a lot and it's one of my favorites. The food is great and the service is also. Busy nights (Friday and Saturday) expect a little longer of a wait to get your food. Their mudslides are amazing, and if I wanted to compliment the menu I'd have to compliment it all. The Jack Daniels menu is especially good, and I love the new 2 for $10 menu. Saves me a lot of money! I've never been disappointed in this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington?start=20,2.42,2.42,2.42,2.42,2.42
5,Tj M.,"Flanagan, IL",2,169,176.0,3.0,2012-07-14,I normally don't review chain restaurants however we always get a decent meal here.I really enjoy the ribs here and they are always cooked just right and they fall of the bone.My girl gets the fish and she really likes the salmon there.The service is usually good and they always refill our drinks which we both like to see(i hate to ask).Under normal circumstances we would only go here with a coupon because it can get expensive without one.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington?start=20,,,,,
3,Rob G.,"Martinsburg, WV",20,90,2.0,4.0,2013-05-12,"I usually avoid chain restaurants especially when I travel but this was right next to my hotel and I was hungry.  I am glad I tried the place. I was pleasantly surprised.  The service was outstanding.  Both times I ate here on my trip the servers were accommodating, friendly, and even fun.  The food was also a nice surprise.  I had an appetizer platter on one trip and and wings on my other trip.  Many of the appetizers were very original and very tasty and you could get three kinds for the price of an entree.  I loved this option. Since I like to try various foods.  My favorite was the ahi tuna with guacamole.  Drinks were also reasonably priced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington?start=20,,,,,
2,Omri K.,"Normal, IL",0,21,,1.0,2013-05-22,"I used to go to TGI Fridays but then had one of the worst experiences with a waiter I have ever had. I called the manager who talked about how the guy was one of his best waiters. I blew it off. The next week we went back and the the same waiter hissed at us ""I know who you are and do not think I want to serve you"". He left us sitting at the table. I suspect he would have come back but by that point I was concerned he would do something to my food, so I took my elderly mother and left. I did not call the manager again as I thought ""if this is one of his best waiters, I just will not go back"" and I have not. I used to go there every few weeks but I will never go back again. I can handle bad food but bad service is inexcusable and unforgivable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington?start=20,,,,,
28,Shelly B.,"Normal, IL",2,13,7.0,2.0,2013-08-16,"Went to Fridays because was looking for something different than our usual. Was very disappointed in over cooked steak, chewy lobster topping and over cooked broccoli. The  only highlight was the strawberry basil margaritas, as long as you don't mind waiting an hour between drinks...maybe I'm just a lush. Fridays just won't be on my Friday lineup again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington,,,,,
19,Ronee B.,"Indianapolis, IN",88,355,228.0,2.0,2014-03-10,"We were meeting family out of state so a place that was easy and familiar was necessary. The service was actually top notch. Drink refills came out in record time and I was never with an empty cup. I ordered the Korean tacos which was pretty tasty, but a tad too much cilantro for my liking. My hubby ordered a sandwhich very plain and he was very clear he just wanted meat and cheese on the bun as he dislikes veggies and sauces if any kind. His sammy came out with mayo slathered all over it. Also, he tasted a chip (the homemade chips are pretty darn yummy), and under a chip was a piece of paper wrapping that didn't belong there. The waitress took the whole thing back and got a new one and comped us the mess. Given the fiasco I rated less than three stars. We wouldn't go back. The menu is lackluster as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington,,,,,

0,James R.,"Fairbury, IL",0,9,,3.0,2015-01-10,"Wasn't very busy, service was a little slow but had drinks the whole time. Food was good but was just warm instead of hot. Ok place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington?start=20,,,,,
27,Rob B.,"Grapevine, TX",19,26,28.0,2.0,2015-01-27,"Food was fine. Typical of the chain. I sat at the bar and my eyes were burning from the strong disinfectant smell that permeated the area. The floor might have been really clean, but it was really off-putting. I hope they can figure out a way to rinse that smell out after they mop the floor, or I won't be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington,,,,,
24,Rich A.,"East Cobb, GA",25,209,4.0,1.0,2015-04-25,"Idiotapalooza!   Where else would they bring out your entree first, followed by soup followed by chips - then offer to keep the entre warm instead of a fresh entree.  Add to that no drink refill and you get king of sucksville!  Well done tgif!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington,,,,,
1,Ashley R.,"Peru, IL",0,9,,1.0,2015-06-29,"I went to eat here with my boyfriend for my 21st birthday. Last time I been to a TGI Fridays had been years. My boyfriend has never been to a TGI Friday's before. To start off with we both ordered pasta. Neither one of us cared for it. The pasta was still cold and no flavor. We even ordered an appetizer, but we didn't see that until our meal was just about done. Of course, I had just turned 21 I wanted an alcoholic beverage. The glass was smaller than my boyfriend's glass for his water, barely any alcohol in it, and it was $14. I even asked the server how much the drink was because we did not see it on the menu, and she said no more than $8. $14 is a bit more than $8. After that food trip we are never eating at TGI Friday's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington?start=20,,,,,
21,Tim S.,"Bloomington, IL",0,1,,1.0,2015-07-11,"Keep driving. Next place will be better, whatever it is. Endless appetizer took 30 minutes. Drink order wrong. Not even busy. Done with this franchise for life. $100 down the drain and I didn't get dinner. Third visit. Third location. All bad. Infrastructure broke",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington,,,,,

22,Jay B.,"Champaign, IL",55,177,81.0,4.0,2015-11-26,Meets all my TGI expectations. Unlike the Champaign location didn't put up a chief mural so that's a plus.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington,,,,,
15,Alex C.,"Orland Park, IL",93,307,120.0,3.0,2015-12-07,"I was in town for a date and although a place like this would never be my first choice, she thought it would be quick and easy. Alas, to TGI Friday's we go. The last time I was at one of these I actually remember having a decent burger from the Jack Daniel's part of the menu. I wasn't too hungry so I opted for something a little lighter. I went with the chicken cobb salad with honey mustard dressing. She got a chicken sandwich, I don't remember which one specifically. My salad was a giant, heaping portion. It was quite difficult to toss/mix after I put the dressing on, perhaps a larger plate or even bowl would have made it more manageable. Everything tasted pretty fresh, the chicken wasn't bad. For $9.50, it was a good, fairly healthier meal. She said her chicken sandwich was pretty good. Our server was nice, we barely saw her but then again we didn't really need her for very much.  Overall it was a decent meal for ~$10/person. Nothing to really rave about, but not bad either. I'd probably order something more appropriate next time, like I said I do recall one of the Jack Daniel's burgers being good last time I was at a Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington,,,,,
16,Aaron H.,"Peoria, IL",260,178,483.0,3.0,2016-05-30,"When walking in no one was at the front to seat us and the place was empty.  A guy come walking up and grabbed two menus and started walking away.  He took us to a booth, put the menus down, then left without saying a word!  This was a turnoff right away!  If i wouldn't have had a gift card to use i would have walked out.  The waiter, who was also the bartender, was great and super polite.  After reading the menu, I realized that if you don't like sauces on your food then you are mainly out of luck.  The food was average and yet expensive.  This just wasnt my favorite place to eat.  I ordered the truffle oil burger which was ok but lacked seasoning.  I also think it was a frozen patty.  My partners pasta dish he said was edible but the lunch portion was so small he finished and was still hungry.  Its not this location that bothers me, its the entire franchise!  I won't be back to any TGI Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington,,,,,
20,Memee O.,"Normal, IL",0,4,,1.0,2016-06-29,"I will never go back, the music was blasting, the waiters could not even hear us give our orders.

18,Carolynne I.,"Bloomington, IL",0,5,1.0,1.0,2016-07-21,Disappointing food and drinks. Ordered new mahi mahi sandwich to only find out after the order was placed they were out. Jack Daniels chicken sandwich was Luke warm and bun fell apart. Drink was not made as stated in menu. Good service. Probably will not return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington,,,,,
12,J C.,"Normal, IL",0,17,10.0,2.0,2017-07-11,"Great service by our attentive waitress.  Food was as good as expected.  The place was in dire need of a deep clean and attention to detail.  For $34 including tip,  this should have been a much better kept establishment. I saw the manager walking around 3x, had he been cleaning anything, it would have been an improvement.  One gripe on the menu - almost nothing priced in a lunch portion separate from dinner prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington,,,,,
14,Douglas L.,"Bloomington, IL",0,6,,1.0,2017-08-25,This Fridays's use to be a fav spot for us. We use to go every Friday night. The past several years we've been going every 4-6 weeks. Tonight was so disappointing. The food just didn't seem up to the usual standard. The restaurant needs a good cleaning all over. And we were over charged on the bill- I asked the server to correct it and she said she would- she dropped off the check book the second time and left abruptly. She did not redo the itemized check but rather took some amount off the credit card signature paper. Very confusing- possibly still not correct because the taxes were not adjusted. Just wrong!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
13,Chad W.,"Arrowsmith, IL",0,3,,1.0,2017-11-10,"Waited 15 min for a table which is no big deal. Then after being seated watched several servers walk by and look at us but no one stopped or even asked if we had been waited on. Finally after 15 min without anyone waiting on us we left. People next to us said they would not be back because they said the food was not very good and that we werent missing anything by leaving. Too bad, used to be a good place to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
9,Erica M.,"Bloomington, IL",78,168,190.0,3.0,2017-11-11,"This is a pretty typical TGI Fridays. My husband and I went on a Saturday evening around 5:00 pm. It wasn't very busy so we were seated immediately after arriving. To drink, I had the Pink Punk Mojito and my husband had a Regal Apple Sangria. Both were pretty tasty, especially the Mojito. To eat, I had had the Million Dollar Cobb Salad with honey mustard dressing and my husband had the ribs. My salad was decent, though the chicken was under seasoned.  My husband enjoyed his ribs. For dessert we had the brownie skillet, which was my favorite part of the meal. It was very delicious. Overall service was pretty decent, about what you would expect from a chain restaurant. All in all, not my favorite restaurant in town, by it's nice to go to from time to time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
11,Cat L.,"Lawrence, KS",11,79,409.0,1.0,2017-11-18,"The worst TGIF place I've ever been to. Even good service can't bring up this location's rating. I made the mistake of done here two nights in a row since I was staying at Hilton for business trip. Ordered ribs & Caesar salad ...how can you go wrong w salad? But apparently you can. I've never had ribs taste w so much  sugary sauce that made of just onion and sugar ...and the onion is not even caramelized ‍ The second night I tried the shrimp & chicken pasta and they're gotta the saltiest pasta EVER. Needlessly to say, never again. To make sure I'm not stopping by this place, I'll make sure to never stay at the Doubletree Hilton next door next time I'm in Bloomington as well",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
10,Jesmin N.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,179,326.0,2.0,2017-12-04,"We came in after a movie so it was past 10pm on a Friday night. Service was pretty ok until our waiter went on break, without telling us, so were were left in a lurch until the person working the bar came out and started helping us. That being said, they were both nice and attentive once they started helping us.  The food was nothing special but somewhat hit the spot. We ordered chicken tenders, burger and the oreo ice cream dessert they had. The portion size is pretty big, I ended up with quite a few tenders left over. Over all the presentation was lacking and they do say you eat with your eyes first. The dessert was actually unappetizing when it came out, but tasted pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
