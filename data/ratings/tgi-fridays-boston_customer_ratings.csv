Also there was an African-American man wearing a do-rag with his pants literally down below his buttocks and a red ""FBS"" tee shirt going behind the hostess bar taking their time chatting when the hostesses should have been seating people.

44,Anthony L.,"Boston, MA",159,221,75.0,3.0,2012-02-17,"This is a chain restaurant which means you should never get your hopes up. I went here on a Friday afternoon for lunch with some colleagues. I assumed since they are located in the Longwood Medical Area, they are used to people going there for a quick lunch (say, 45 - 60 minutes at the most).  We get there and we were told the wait will be 10 minutes. I was slightly confused since there were many open tables, but there's no use in arguing. 25 minutes later we were seated.  I'll give everyone the benefit of the doubt, maybe they were super busy the whole day. Perhaps they are understaffed. I don't know the reason, but it took forever for everything! 10-15 minutes after we place our drink order (all waters) we were finally ordering. About 30 minutes after ordering we finally got our food. And 5 minutes after we get the food we -finally- get cutlery.  Maybe I sound like a super complainer, but how long does it take to make 6 salads? I imagine a chef placed one piece of lettuce, ever so gingerly, on top of each other followed by the tomato, grilled chicken, and cheese. Seriously though, half-hour to make? Humph! On the upside, my salad was indeed delicious. I ordered the grilled chicken cobb salad with extra bleu cheese on the side and lemon-ginger ""splash"" (for less than $9! Bargain). Everything tasted fresh (hopefully it was) and the chicken was prepared perfectly.  Was the service sub-par? Yeah. Did it take forever to feed my hungry tummy? You bet. Was the food good?

Our server was very nice and super attentive. Our dinner went by quite quickly because she was so attentive! It was good that it went by quickly since this was the night of Game 6 for the Celtics and we were ready to eat and leave so we can catch the game.  This time my friend and I shared a Japanese hibachi chicken skewer, which I LOVED. It was so good! And for entrees I got a Cobb salad, which was also very good!

66,Garrett S.,"Boston, MA",0,8,,2.0,2012-06-22,"I would not classify myself as a fan of Fridays, my second time eating at a Fridays didn't really meet my expectations. I arrived at Fridays, the waitstaff at this location were friendly and on point.  This is more or less what I expected.  The first thing I ordered was the Skinny Margarita which was almost sickeningly sweet, definitely too much sour mix.  After that I ordered the 3 for 16.99 which consisted of Fried Mozzarella, Cheese Burger, and the Oreo Madness.   The Fried  Mozzarella was very tasty and what one would expect from fried cheese.  Weren't amazing but weren't bad. Next was my burger, and here is where things fell apart.  After taking off the buns and eating my side of mixed vegetables I start to eat the burger.  After I get about halfway through I notice a very unusual texture, something very gritty.  There was sandy-dirt on the lettuce in my burger.  To the dismay of my group I decided to bring this up to our waitress.  She apologized, and went to go check on it with the chefs.    When she returned she informed me that it was actually the spread they use on their bean burger, right...  From then out she apologized again and comped the burger for me as I would hope. Last was the Oreo madness which was yummy, an over sized Oreo cookie ice cream sandwich whats not to like? At the end of the meal I was less than impressed however I did feel that the service here was pretty good considering the sandy burger.  The checks were divided up without having to ask and the wait time was relatively short. Lastly I left feeling a tad uneasy because of the server's explanation.  Given I fancy myself quite the foodie, I am sure I can tell the difference between sandy dirt and a spread for another type of burger.  I must say in the end I was wondering what is the logic behind using sand as an ingredient in a spread.  However I didn't want to give them 1 star on what I would hope to be a fluke.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston?start=80,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.024,2.68

Tonight I saw something that was completely and utterly disgusting at one of your locations.  I was walking in and 3 girls slowly walked out...a waitress ran up to the ""security"" people...the ones who wear the red shirts who stand/sit by the front door staring at their phones...and told them that the girls walked out on their check.  As the girls slowly continued to walk away...one of the ""security"" guards ran to the doorway...stopped...and yelled for the girls to come back.  By this time...the girls were just about around the corner and out of ear shot.  The ""security"" guard...while still standing in the doorway then proceeded to point in the general direction of the girls who were slowly walking away to the assistant manager who also stood in the doorway and watched as the girls slowly walked around the front of an adjoining building and out of sight.  The assistant manager continued to stand in the doorway and stare at GOD KNOWS WHAT for about 30 seconds.   The waitress and SEVERAL patrons...including myself were obviously pissed that ""security"" and ""management"" stood by and did nothing.  I was informed that the waitress was going to be written up because of this.  I gave her $10 out of my pocket for the tip that she missed out on.   I work in the food service industry and I was COMPLETELY disgusted by what I saw.  I will NEVER come back to this location and I will now give all of my business to the bar next door.  I am not alone....6 people paid their tabs and also left to go next door.   The same ""security"" people caused this location to comp SEVERAL meals a few weeks ago because they made a spectacle out of a mouse that was running around the bar.  No one would have noticed the freakin' mouse if ""security"" didn't chase the freakin' thing around the bar while disturbing patrons while they did it.

I, like many others I'm sure, used to frequent the Newbury Street location..I used to go to that one a fair bit, and then I left town. Anyway, it's close to the T at least and in a decent area, with Longwood and Brigham Circle being around and all. It's in a new-ish complex that has a Stop and Shop and a Walgreen's.  Ok, on to the actual food. I sat by the bar since there was a bit of a wait for tables and it made more sense since I was by myself. I had a couple Buds ($3) while watching some game on the TV. For an entree, I ordered my go-to, the Jack Daniel's Sirloin and Shrimp ($20.99). I always liked the Jack Daniel's stuff...that sauce is like crack cocaine for some reason. The steak was cooked to specification, medium well, but wasn't as tasty as some steaks I've had. It came with two sides, so I had the jasmine rice and garlic mashed potatoes. Nothing awful, but nothing mind blowing either. Overall vibe of the place would have to be a mash-up of the ""hood"" crowd, as someone else mentioned, and the college aged crowd. I wasn't too surprised by this considering its location...Roxbury, one of the ""hoods"", is like a good 5 minutes east on Tremont, and there's a bunch of colleges on Huntington Ave near Longwood and MFA. I enjoyed the contrast though...it was pretty interesting. Bill comes to around $30, which isn't bad. I enjoyed the service as a whole, so 18% seemed sufficient as a tip.

78,Sidney L.,"San Francisco, CA",335,163,4.0,3.0,2013-03-10,"Three different social groups intersect in Mission Hill, and they all have their different bars in the area. There are the students (Flann's), the health care types (The Squealing Pig), and the local born-and-raised types, who seem to largely be the kinds of people that TGI serves. I have frequented this TGIs many times for lunch, dinner, mostly because it is one of the few sit-down establishments in the area, and this place is also a decent option for happy hour (half off certain appetizers). - The nice thing about restaurant chains is that you know what you're going to get, and TGI Friday's is no different. You'll get solid service and a reliable commercial menu, at reasonable (though by no means cheap) prices. - The bar is a good place to catch a sports game. They have a lot of TVs, so no matter where you are seated, you'll have one (or a few) screens to look at. It gets pretty rowdy come playoff time for Bruins and Celtics games. - You can get a pretty good deal on a meal if you do a 2 for $10/$12/$15 meal. There are also lots of ways to get coupons for a discount or free appetizer (signing up for the mailing list, filling out a survey, using their smartphone app). The ""endless lunch"" comes with all you can eat salad, breadsticks, soup, and soda, and that's a pretty good deal too. Note that their Caesar salad comes with a ""Caesar vinaigrette"" (whatever that is), not a creamy Caesar dressing. - TGI Friday's is not such a great place for vegetarians. There's not much on the menu for vegetarians, other than salads. I really struggled with the menu during a short vegetarian phase I went through. - The ribs, the chicken and shrimp pasta, and the the green beans fries (you can pretend like these are healthy) are a few dishes that stand out in my mind.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston?start=80,2.8,2.8,2.8,1.9640000000000002,2.8

My problem with that, is our bags. The bags that belong to the kids will be opened and closed multiple times (depending upon what the kids want from the bag) so it'll inevitably wind up in the aisle. We asked for a booth and after much debate over a booth in this or that section (she kept checking the seating arrangements - but all the booths were empty) we got the one right at the door.  Drinks were taken immediately, our server was quite pleasing and patient as our 6yr couldn't make up his mind. 5 minutes later we ordered our food. No apps, just entrees. So here's why 2 stars. 35 mins later we are still waiting for food. Normally not a problem to wait but the restaurant was maybe 35% capacity. My picky eater even noticed the food was taking a while. We asked the server and she said she'd check, her response was the kitchen was slow. Slow?? Most of the patrons when we entered were eating already. Since we were at the door we could tell how many people had come in, and maybe only 2 more parties had entered. 40 mins after ordering we were eating. The food was good and nothing wrong with our orders but the wait time was just not cool. Also I am a huge fan of ""Shantys"" (lemonade and beer) but the one they are offering was horrible.

For our group, we got boneless parmesan garlic wings, boneless buffalo wings, spinach and cheese dip, and mozzarella cheese sticks.  We ordered a total of 3 rounds and that was plenty of food.  As a tip, I suggest you put in the next order right when your food comes out and ask for them to come out as they are ready (instead of waiting for all of them to come out at the same time).  Doing this will expedite the rate at which you receive your food.  We were so full and couldn't finish our third round so we took a bunch of leftovers home.

132,Ken S.,"Boston, MA",0,4,,1.0,2014-10-16,"I ordered the sirloin (with garlic butter) well done and double french fries. When my food arrived, it was apparently the Angus sirloin not the garlic butter sirloin. It came with a sauce I didn't want, which spilled on the fries. The steak was so burned that I thought it was coated with the sauce so I sent it back. The bartender brought the same steak back without the side of sauce, so I bit into the steak and it was too charred to eat. So I politely asked that they do it over. The bartender said in a friendly tone, ""Why don't you munch on the fries while we redo that for you."" I thought, ""Okay, that's nice, he's trying to make this a little better by giving me some fries while I wait."" I nibbled a little on the fries, but I really didn't just want a plate of fries without the steak, especially because they did not season the fries at all.  I would have asked them to just do the steak medium well, but I had just eaten here two nights earlier, ordered the same thing, and it was WONDERFUL. So I simply waited to see what would happen. When the bartender came back with just a piece of meat on an empty plate and no new fries to replace the ones that had gotten cold while I waited, I knew that it was time to give up on this experience altogether. I choked down the new piece of steak (which was still overcooked and bone dry because they still didn't include the garlic butter topping) and the cold french fries, and I left exactly a 15 percent tip (when I usually tip 20 to 25). No one asked me ""how was it?"" because as far as I could tell, no one gave a damn. I've been to this Fridays at least six times in the last year, and this was the worst visit I ever had.

5,Essence T.,"Big Pine Key, FL",1,10,12.0,2.0,2016-03-19,"Me & my boyfriend went there last night as a last minute cool off type of date from work. We mainly went for appetizers and a drink. When we walked in, around 10:30, it was packed but was told the wait would be 20 minutes so we decided to wait it out. We asked the host would it be okay to wait at the bar until we were called for a table. He said it was fine. Before we ordered drinks and an endless app, I asked the bartender would we be charged twice for the app once we got seated at a table. She said no we would just have to close our tab with her and tell our waiter that we already paid from the bar and that we should tell our waiter to let our manager know when we get our second receipt. After about 30 minutes at the bar, my boyfriend got up to see where were we in getting a table. The host said he already called our name. I never heard our name called. Granted it was busy but he may have said it to the waiting area but didn't come over to the bar side as other restaurants do. Nevertheless my boyfriend wasn't mad, he just asked that we be alerted for the next available one.  We closed our bar tab & finally get a table. The host leads us and my boyfriend brought up the endless app thing again just for clarity, he said what the bartender said. The wait for our food and drinks was extra long but again we were just there to wind down. When we got our check, it had our drinks okay but also an endless appetizer. My boyfriend kindly told our waitress that we already paid for it and was continuing to eat the same item. We told her what both the bartender and host said, she said she would ask her manager. She came back about 15 minutes later and said that the manager was very busy and couldn't come over at the moment. Well then. My boyfriend said well ask the bartender because he was not about to pay twice for an ENDLESS APPETIZER!! The bartender came over with an attitude and said well idk if y'all misunderstood but blah blah blah bullshit! My boyfriend took control of the situation and told her exactly what she told us and how she was wrong, trying to argue with us over $12 which we shouldn't have to pay. But she just continued to be aggressive, slammed our check on the table and walked away. My boyfriend ended up paying for it twice. Our waitress kept apologizing but we reinsured her it wasn't her fault and that they need new ppl or retrain the old ones on real customer service. I was furious.

Was asked by TGI Friday's Corporate multiple time for my number which I provided and never heard from anyone!  Now I know where they get their standards!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston?start=20,1.64,2.01,2.01,,1.8619999999999999
26,Lekeisha J.,"Dorchester, Boston, MA",0,1,,1.0,2017-06-03,"I arrived at the restaurant and was seated in Anthony's section! I kid you not, we waited 10 min for a greeting. We looked around and waited patiently. He greeted us and we ordered a berry slush for my son, two jose cuervo margaritas and two waters for my girlfriend and I. Also, we went ahead and put my sons order and a app( bone in buff wings) with ranch and bleu cheese. 5 min later my son gets his slushy which he was excited about. 10 min later, our wings finally come out with bleu cheese only. I asked his service partner if we could have app plates and ranch. She then stated, "" I suppose you need napkins too?"" I said yes, that would be great! At this point, STILL NO MARGARITAS NOR WATERS with buffalo wings at the table! Anthony comes back says ""well, I'm waiting on the bartender!"" I didn't even bother to mention the waters to him! He takes my girlfriends food order( RIBEYE MED RARE w/ broccoli and mash/add ons :half rack, fried shrimp, and jasmine rice.) Finally, our margaritas come to the table! 10 min later, he brings out her steak plate without the add ons. I said "" Anthony, where is my sons food? We ordered that first and we wanted him to eat first and you don't even have the entire meal ready. he said, ""well, I'm just bringing it how it comes out!"" She cuts into the steak which she thought was a little to rare for her so she wanted it cooked up a little bit. We asked him if could they cook it up a little bit and he said "" well, its medium rare how you ordered it! Let me get my manager!"" EXSCUSE ME? You should never say that to a paying guest!! That was rude!  The manager(a short Hispanic man) then came over, and he said he would have it cooked up a bit. I expressed everything we had been through and he says I'm sorry. Finally, my sons food came and steak came back CHARRED.  He took care of my sons food and some of my girlfriends! Why didn't you take care of the whole meal that she ordered? WE still paid $60 for a horrible experience and tipped Anthony",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston?start=20,1.6,2.01,2.01,,1.8459999999999999
104,Tianna D.,"Brighton, Brighton, MA",0,41,164.0,4.0,2017-06-13,My boyfriend was told that the Jack Daniel Ribs here are good so that's how we ended up here. We're from Jamaica and back home they alter the seasoning and taste of the food to our tastebuds which makes it taste so good. The service is probably the same as the previous reviews of this TGI as well as all the other TGIF I looked up on yelp throughout the states. So the service experience wouldn't be new but surprising for being in the US. So we were prepared for anything. When we got here the place was pretty empty so we put in our name for a table and the hostess says 15-20 minute wait. I thought how what why? It's empty. Anyway we didn't complain cuz we expected it. 5-10 minutes later she said our table is ready. So they under promised and over delivered which was good. Then they seated us in a booth. I must say they could do a refurnishing of their both chairs. There was a big rip on booth seats in our booth and when I looked around other booths seamed to have them too. I guess this would be my only complaint of the night. Our waitress happened to be someone we knew through a friend so I'm not sure if this made the review rating higher for us but we got really good service even though we are acquaintances. Our orders were correct and the food came out within an appropriate time from ordering. So here's what we ordered: - The Potstickers for appetizers. It was my first time having potstickers. They were good. - The Jack Daniel Ribs (our reason for coming). We were a little disappointed by the size of the ribs cuz you know this America and everything comes large but this time it was the right portion to be honest. But it's ribs!! We want a nice 18in length rib! Haha but it was really good. The flavour was good and it was so soft and tender that the meat fell right off the bone as u bit it. - The Fried Shrimp. This was good too. It was seasoned well and the shrimp was still very soft and big from being fried.  Drinks: I ordered the Berry Sangria which I recommend and my boyfriend had the Tropical Long Island Tea but he didn't like it so much. It wasn't very strong with liquor for him but he did like the regular Long Island Tea. So we came here with low expectations and ended up getting a good experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston,1.72,2.01,2.01,,1.894
106,Vanessa S.,"Boston, MA",0,10,32.0,2.0,2017-07-14,"This location has the worst service ever. 5 women standing at the front entrance and only a few waiters servicing multiple tables. The food was average. Pot stickers are always yummy. The steak was burnt, probably because i asked for it to be well done. Broccoli had too much lemon flavor.

We ordered the peach sangria...it was heavenly and riiiiigghhhhttt!! Long story short. She ordered 2 sliders with grilled onions that came separately...and might i add took forever. My daughter and i were finished with our meals. Anywho my meal was amazing. I ordered the cajun chicken n shrimp pasta with spicy alfredo sauce and added broccoli. I substituted fettucinne for penne...it was  . i ordered the half bowl for $9.50 it was worth every penny. The kick from the food and the sweetness from our drink made my experience amazing...my friend....not so much. Maybe next time. Our waitress was very fast but started getting slower towards the end. Still give her an A for effort. I shall return cuz Fridays is my go to spot. Love yall!! Also...Troy is so accommodating, he wasn't our waiter this time around but he's so friendly and warm i wish he was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston,1.84,2.05,2.05,,1.966

103,Emmalee T.,"Boston, MA",113,9,,1.0,2017-08-04,"Hoo boy. Where do I even start? Probably by saying I've never had worse service at a restaurant. That in and of itself should tell you to stay away, but I'll get into the gory details so I can make it as clear to you as possible that you shouldn't eat here. But first, let me get out of the way the only two good things of the night: 1) We were seated quickly (on a Thursday night, the place wasn't busy. The fact that it wasn't busy only made the indignities to come seem worse). 2) The food tasted decent. Nothing stunning, but decent. You don't come to TGI Fridays for stunning food, though. If you walk in knowing what you signed up for, food-wise, you will get exactly what you expect. (Unless they leave out parts of your order.... but we'll get to that.) Now for the bad things. This is a much longer list. 1) We waited half an hour for our drinks, despite sitting right next to the bar, where we could see there was literally nothing going on. There wasn't even a bartender behind the bar for ten minutes, even though there were a few (a few) people sitting at said bar. This should have been a warning to us.  2) Our waitress waited till that half-hour had elapsed and she'd brought everyone else their drinks to tell me the bartenders had no idea how to make a michelada (basically beer, lime juice, and hot sauce), and could I order something else. I ordered a bourbon with seltzer and lime. I was brought a bourbon with seltzer and..... lemon. I drank it because a) lemon is also good and b) I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes, but I was confused - how do you mess up something so simple? 3) We ordered our food at the same time as our drinks. Five of us went for the endless apps, I (doing the low-carb thing at present) went for a green-style buffalo burger with a side salad. (With ranch. This'll be important later.) Over 45 minutes went by before any of us got any food, and then it was only me.  5) I immediately noticed my burger was missing the skewer of wings that it's supposed to come with, and my salad was missing the ranch.  6) Our waitress came by to inform us she'd delivered the first round of the apps to the (very confused) table next to us, and that was why we hadn't gotten them yet. No apology. Just sort of.... matter-of-factly told us, while bringing out (finally) some of the apps we had ordered - in half-portions. The first round of endless apps is supposed to be full portions. I know, cause I've been through this shindig before, in other, happier times. She vanished before I could ask about the wings or ranch. 7) Five minutes later, she brought me the skewer of wings without being prompted, but also without apology or explanation. I asked if I could please get the ranch my salad was supposed to come with, and she brought that too. Again, unapologetic. I began to wonder if I was in an alternate universe. Even at the dive-iest restaurants I've been to, if multiple things are missing from an order AND some of the food is delivered to the wrong table, someone has apologized about it. Doesn't even have to be sincere! I get that people are busy! Just... SOMETHING. Something to acknowledge that your customers are people and not just cardboard cutouts with food-holes. 8) Our second round of apps ALSO got delivered to the wrong table. Another 20 minutes later. A different waiter brought out the third round so we didn't have the same problem again. 9) By 10 pm (over 2 hours after we had arrived) my friends had gotten 3 rounds of half-portioned apps, and were ready to give up. I'd eaten my burger and salad, which wasn't bad, but definitely not worth putting myself through that experience. Frustrated, exhausted, and still kind of hungry, they asked for the check, which was brought to us with the district manager's card tucked inside, as though our waitress KNEW we had had a terrible time but wasn't going to say anything about it. We were about to pay it when we realized they'd charged me for the michelada I never got, as well as the drink they did make me. Funny enough, they knew how to spell michelada but not how to make it. We pointed this out and she took the check back to fix it. Again.... surprise, surprise.... no apology whatsoever. What a nightmare. I'm going to strongly discourage anyone I know from coming here again. Please, for the love of god, just go across the street to Penguin, where you will have both much better food and waitstaff who actually seem like they might care whether or not their customers have a good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston,1.92,2.03,2.03,,1.986
112,Dominique M.,"Chelsea, MA",21,9,,1.0,2017-08-13,"I came in on a Saturday night and this place was DEAD, which is why I'm even more confused on how it could to take forever for me to receive every single thing I ordered. I can't express how slow the service was, our waiter was polite I'll give him that but I feel like he was more distracted with another table that seemed to be full of his friends. I was there for TWO hours and was only able to have 2 drinks, I felt like I had to rush and order everything at once when I realized how inattentive he was. When I finally got my order the drinks were way too sour and the food tasted extremely cheap (and I know its Fridays I can't expect a lot but I usually like their food).There was a group of workers just standing by the hostess table dancing and being loud the whole thing was just very unprofessional and a total waste of time.

My friend took me out after having a stressful week and we met a beautiful soul named Cheala! She should teach a hospitality class because she was personal-able from the very start. She immediately introduced herself and took our orders(my friend is pregnant and wanted all the food out at the same time lol). She gave recommendations about food and spoke with us like we were old girlfriends. She was attentive, never once did we have to look for her. She anticipated our needs and I highly recommend her to anyone who visits Fridays!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston,2.16,2.04,2.04,,2.088
101,Nicole E.,"North Weymouth, MA",0,2,,1.0,2017-12-22,"If I could give zero stars I would. This was the worst service I have ever received. We arrived at Fridays and it was very slow, not many people in the dining room or the bar. We were seated but not given any menus. About ten minutes went by before a server came by and asked us if the hostess told us who our server was, we said no. He came back about five minutes later, said he would be our server, and gave us menus. We waited awhile for him to come over and take our drink order. When he finally came to take it, we ordered our food at the same time because we could see how slow the service was. We waited a very long time for our drinks. We were seated for at lease 45 minutes before we even received water, and we had to flag down a hostess to even receive that.  We finally got our drinks after being there an hour and then continued to wait another half hour for our food. When the food came, some was missing it was probably another fifteen minutes before that came.The server never came to check on the table and anytime we asked for anything he would disappear for 20 minutes.  We asked for the bill and take out boxes when the missing food came, because we knew it would take a long time. We finally asked to speak to the manager before paying the bill and the server never even apologized. He just started making excuses that they were busy...they weren't, and they were short staffed...didn't look like it to me.  The manager took about fifteen minutes to come over and talk to us and then made excuses that she was out back doing coupons. She only took a small amount off the bill and was not very apologetic. They must get these complaints all the time. I couldn't even enjoy the food because we were there on our lunch break, which was only supposed to be an hour. We ended up being there for two hours and probably spent about 110 minutes waiting and 10 minutes eating. I would recommend that you find someplace else in Brigham Circle, like The Mission or Penguin Pizza, if you want to eat. It is surprising that a restaurant in an area that is heavily trafficked by hospital workers and visitors, would have such slow and terrible service.  I will never eat at this TGI Fridays again. I have had slow service there before, but this is hands down the worst service I have received in my life!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston,2.04,2.03,2.03,,2.0340000000000003

To be honest I'm getting annoyed re-living this situation. If you go to this Fridays make sure you go straight to the bar and just order a drink right away. If you choose to sit at a table, I hope you are not in any type or rush and enjoy taking 2 hours lunches because that's how long its going to take to complete a meal.
