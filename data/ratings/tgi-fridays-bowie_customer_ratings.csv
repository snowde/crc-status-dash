100,Jasmin H.,"Hanover, MD",205,133,15.0,3.0,2012-03-07,"TGI Friday's holds a special place in my heart. Many times when my ex-bf/friend and I would go on dates we would go to DuClaw for the drinks and then Friday's for food since their kitchen stays open later and plenty of NFL Sundays were spent at the bar. They have pretty good food deals from time to time and the music is loud but it didn't really bother us, we were amused. I absolutely love love LOVE the Ultimate Mojito, its the only drink I usually get here. Other than that the drink specials aren't really good, so thats the one downside. I say if your looking for a little fun in good old Bowie, stop thru. I will say that although it stays crowded we've never had to wait more than 20 mins tops for a seat. Even though there are cops that stand guard I've never had an issue or felt unsafe here. GET THE CHICKEN COBB SALAD! Sorry that thing is perfect every time I get it, its quite amazing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bowie?start=100,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997

60,Mo A.,"Washington, DC",3757,414,2038.0,2.0,2012-05-15,"Everything about my original review still stands.  This place is super loud and the clientele tends to be on the rowdier side, even with a cop being stationed in the restaurant.   Service is ridiculously slow and our waitress went incognito on several occasions.   All that being said, I can bump this place up a star for their spinach dip and their new salted caramel cake.   The spinach dip is old faithful at Fridays.  Regardless of how bad the service is as well as the entrees, this appetizer is consistently good.  It features spinach, artichoke hearts, bell peppers and sauteed onions blended with Parmigiano and Romano cheeses, then topped with diced tomatoes.  Tostada chips are your dipping/scooping vehicles.  So creamy with a great cheesy flavor that is balanced without being overwhelming.  The dish comes together perfectly and is great for sharing.     The salted caramel cake is fantastic.  It is vanilla cake layered with vanilla bean pudding and caramel crunch, then drizzled with a salted caramel glaze.  The sweet/salty flavors complement each other well and offer a fun contrast.  The caramel crunch offers a nice texture change up.  The dessert was a little heavy on the caramel, which is a little assertive but just the way I like it.  Nice portion size that is very rich and filling.  My sweet tooth called and congratulated me on a great choice! If you can tolerate loud and obnoxious patrons, aloof servers, long waits for your orders and generally questionable menu options, these two choices may leave you mildly surprised.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bowie?start=80,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024

I had the dragonfire salmon and it was amazing, perfectly cooked. I don't understand all the negative reviews. My date & I had a nice time, our waiter was very courteous and didn't even complain that we were there for nearly 2 hours. Overall, I had a great time and enjoyed the experience.

85,Tawny E.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",6,35,,4.0,2012-09-12,"So folks if u follow me it appears it has been a while since I ve partaken in the fine world of restaurant dining. Well you would be absolutely correct. You might ask what do I win? Well your prize is the truth... its 2012 and it's the great recession. This past Friday I was lucky to have a super nice friend take me out and although it was just TGI Friday's we picked the best night. The server was super polite. Even gave us a to-go cup for our refill. I ordered the three course $12.99 special. First course, I ordered the stupid wedge salad. Really a wedge of iceberg lettuce on my plate. Even a rabbit wants a carrot every now and then. The entree was delicious I had the salmon which was succulent and out of sight. My wonderful friend had the fried shrimp with only Fridays quality seasoned fries. Yum-o was their reply when I asked how they liked their meal. To top it all off the Oreo desert was presented so cute I felt guilty devouring every lil morsel. The manager on shift stopped by at the end of our dinner and of course  I had to give compliments to the chef for a job well done although my jeans would say otherwise lol. I had to be honest and rag on the silly salad. All and all a great experience, but don't take my word for it. After the movies hop right over to TGI Friday's and you be the judge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bowie?start=120,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.16
95,Michelle K.,"Annapolis, MD",140,10,,1.0,2012-11-13,"On Veterans Day 2012, my dad, age 75, (a City of Bowie employee) wanted to go to TGI Fridays in Bowie for his ""free"" lunch that they were offering for Veterans.  So I picked up my dad at his house and off we went.  Unfortunately, it was very crowded with a 45 minute wait; so we went to the bar area and found 2 seats at the bar. It took the bartender 10 minutes to even look our way, it was like he was intentionally ignoring us.  He was busy, but not that busy as there was another helper.  So after 10 or so minutes he asked us for our drink order which we told him we were ready to order. My dad ordered the ""steak skewers with vegetables"" and I ordered the black bean burger with vegetables on the side (no fries).  After that, we sat there for about 35 minutes waiting and waiting for our food (the 2 ladies that came in after us go their food served before us).  Not once did the bartender (not so friendly guy with lots of tattoos on his arms and an attitude) ever check in with us or say anything to us at all. Finally about 45 minutes into sitting there the bartender brought over 2 plates of food.  One was a bacon cheeseburger with fries and the other was a blackbean burger with fries!!!  My father, who is a very gracious and kind person, told the bartender that wasn't what he ordered (not even close!), but that he would eat it.  Remember, he ordered steak and veggie skewers! My order was wrong too... I told the bartender that I ordered vegetables on the side (not fries), to which he replied they were out of ""all"" vegetables in the restaurant.  I told him I would like a side salad with blue cheese dressing then since they didn't have ""vegetables"".  He acted irritated with us.  I ate my black bean burger (it was okay, nothing great) and he never brought me my side salad and never acknowledged it again; nor did he check with us at all.  I had to ask him 3 times for ketchup for my father. It was hard to talk to him because it is so loud and noisy in there and he never looks in your direction or asks you how you are doing.  He was the most non-customer service, non-friendly, rude guy I ever encountered at a restaurant! Finally, I waved him down to get the check and he never gave me a ""check"", he simply says to me while standing in front of the cash register that the total is $18.  I paid the bill although I thought it was a little high for my dad having a ""free"" meal, but we did have 2 drinks (an iced tea and an O'Douls), so I just wanted to get out of there. As I paid the bill, the bartender took my iced tea away that I wasn't finished with so I asked him for a to go cup with a refill or a kids cup, to which he replied ""we don't have to go cups"". I find it hard to believe that a national chain restaurant doesn't have vegetables, to go cups and can't get orders straight!!!  Very unprofessional, disorganized, and a not very clean restaurant.   I will never eat there again!!!  It was a horrible experience. Spend your money somewhere else with a company that cares about their customers and hires friendly, professional, competent people. Normally, I would have gone right to the manager as all of these problems occurred, but my dad doesn't like confrontations or problems, so I bit my tongue and let it go.  However, I plan on calling the manager tomorrow to see what  he or she has to say. The worst $18 I ever spent!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bowie?start=100,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000005
75,Mike H.,"Bowie, MD",6,42,2.0,4.0,2013-01-04,"I was a little skeptical about this place due to this spot making the evening news back in Aug of 2012 (google it!), but I was really hungry...so thought I'd try my luck. Came here on a Thursday night to somewhat of a club-scene in terms of the music and crowd at the bar. Very lively, happenin' place. I preferred to sit in the dining room where it was quiet and calm... although doing so forfeited my right to 1/2 off appetizers (they only give 1/2 off apps after 10pm for patrons who sit at the bar). But I instantly liked my server when I saw her (Jirae Foster), and so decided to pay essentially double for my meal simply to be waited on by her. The service was excellent. She was very attentive, smiled often (bearing an amazing braces-laden grin), charming and good looking. She was quick with my order, kept my drinks a'coming often, and generally seemed happy to be working. When I was indecisive about my order, she even suggested that I try something - and if I didn't like it to return it for something I did like. I'm not the kind to return food at a sit down restaurant (unless the food is horrible), but did appreciate her making the offer. Jirae delivered the kind of service that is unfortunately not typical of an urban TGI Fridays... so seeing her smile and being served by her was totally refreshing. The manager was also very active and visible during my visit (and actually was the one who brought me my food); so seeing him greeting people and actually working made me feel like the joint had made some positive changes to better ensure order in the restaurant on busy nights since its late summer ""incident"". I'm a local and will be back again!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bowie?start=80,2.128,2.128,2.128,2.128,2.128

It was the most awful and downright nasty food experience I have had in ages.  The server advised me two of three things I ordered were no go good to order which I could take as honesty but they did nothing well in the end. I attempted to order the Korean tacos and then a shrimp meal but in the end based on the server went with a cheeseburger... (can't go wrong with that --WRONG!) Okay the chili cheese queso dip was ok but warm at best --- the chips they served with were crystalized with salt. The potstickers were warm as well -- temperature issues!! They might have been decent had they not been sitting or eek warmed up properly!!! Okay my daughter got the chicken fingers and barely ate the fries and in a way I am thankful who knows what I was exposing her too if the chicken fingers were lukewarm as well.

I decided on the Jack Daniel's chicken (you can never go wrong when Jack is involved) so that was pretty good.  For my 2 sides I had the mashed potatoes which weren't impressive and the tomato mozzarella salad which was just okay.  I can see that they've changed their menu up a bit and the prices have gone up since the last time I've been here.   The bathrooms were kept clean and neat and once our server became visible, she was rather attentive.  The noise in the bar area was pretty loud and a little disturbing at times.  It was just a mediocre experience.

68,Ray R.,"Delaware, OH",91,221,9.0,2.0,2015-01-22,"Stopped here because I was starving and it was close to the hotel. Exterior:  this location is located in a shared parking lot with a couple of restaurants and a movie theater just behind.  The entrance is not off the primary road, so you might have to use GPS to find it.  The exterior grounds were clean and presentable. Interior:  the interior was overall clean.  As I was waiting to be seated, I noticed a number of tables that had not been bussed yet.  The main seating area appears to be on the right side of the restaurant, with a bar area to the left of the main entrance.  I saw additional seating further to the right, past the bar area. Staff:  this is the reason for so few stars.  My waiter was perfect.  Professional, attentive, polite, and personable are all words to describe him.  The rest of the staff definitely were less so.  The waitress stand was unoccupied when I went in and continued to remain unoccupied during my entire visit.  I observed numerous couples/groups come in and stand for up to 5 minutes waiting to be addressed.  Staff would simply walk past them on the way to or from their tables.  One waitress did take care of a couple and walked to the back to yell that they needed help out front.  However, no one took up the challenge of coming up front.  The couple she seated waited roughly 10 minutes before anyone came to their table.  I was in a position to hear there was not an assigned staff member for that area and the couple shouldn't have been seated there.  I observed many of the tables around me being ignored or not getting a staff member to come but every once in a great while (after their glasses were completely empty).  I couldn't identify whom the manager was (or if there was one), but having a manager visible and directing the activity would have been beneficial. Food:  I ordered the Jack Daniels ribeye, mac & cheese, and tomato mozzarella salad.  The ribeye was cold when I received it, but the mac & cheese was perfect.  The salad was also just the way I like it.  I was starved, so I didn't care if the ribeye was cold...it was cooked perfectly at least. Overall, if you find yourself starved and want immediate assistance, this is not the place to dine.  There are many other restaurants extremely close to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bowie?start=80,2.08,2.08,2.08,1.512,2.08

27,Taz W.,"Washington, DC",210,127,287.0,2.0,2015-03-21,"First let me preface by saying I uae to work at the largest Olive Garden in the U.S. in San Diego, we were a well oiled machine with overall good management  (we didn't always like them, but we as a team got the job done) Ok let's just jump into the bad & ugly first: 1. They do not take reservations for large parties 2. They seat extremely large parties before less than half of their party arrives 3. We needed an area for a party of 12, we were originally given 3 separate tables that were way too far apart 4. They kept talking about they just seated a party of 26...this was some freaking teenagers that was less our party of 12 (like WTF???) 5. Service was slow, even to get our children drinks, appetizers, or food so my son was screaming out the entire night until he had his food. (I'm actually still mad about this right now at 6:18am...I may call you alls Regional Manager about this) *Educational Tip: When a family comes in immediately ask what the parents would like for the child to eat & drink, parents can starve to death but absolutely get pissed if our child is hungry. We also barley get to eat so putting in the child's order first when appetizers would normally go in for the entire table allows the parents to feed the child first then enjoy their own meal when their food comes around.* 6. Under staffed on a Friday night...at T.G.I. Fridays??? This was the part that didn't make any sense & resulted in a domino effect on our entire evening. Management...it's the second day of spring,  use your brains... 7. ""We don't have any Kid's Menus (obviously no crayons as well)...I blame management for this is well because most of your staff doesn't even know the Kid's Menu by heart...I'm irritated again. The good: 1. The food was on point & the drinks were great (alcoholic & non-alcoholic) 2. The place was very clean 3. Eric & a pregnant female server were very friendly If the management at this location was better then they could be as good as the Fridays in District Heights or The Boulevard because the servers would be set up for success.

He proceeded to take 3 more calls and immediately walked back to his co-workers after finishing the 3rd call. I was upset by this point so I started looking around for anyone to assist me. One of his co-workers mentioned I was waiting and he came up to greet me. I expressed my dissatisfaction for waiting but he remained calm and we ended up making light of the situation. He brought out my food and I believe it was MUCH more than I was supposed to receive. I appreciate this young man for remaining calm and not throwing an attitude at me because I expressed my dissatisfaction. And he did what he could to rectify my wait time.

We ordered drinks (a marguerita for the Missus and a smoothie for me).  It took forever.  The main food took awhile as well. I ordered my Jack Daniels steak medium which they cooked to almost completely well but it did have the ever so slightest hint of pink so maybe it was medium well. The dessert was good but it involved a heated Tennessee Whiskey cake and a scoop of ice cream so the heated cake had all but melted the ice cream by the time it got to out table. Here's the deal. I've been to this Fridays about four times because it's close to my home, because it's close to the theater, because they send coupons but if I were upper management at Fridays I would seriously be looking at closing this place down.  The only thing I can think is that it does a hell of a bar business or goes crazy busy at night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bowie?start=20,1.64,1.64,1.64,1.1560000000000001,1.6400000000000001

Annoying and unacceptable. We were finally greeted after 10 minutes, and taken our table.  We were reluctant about the area we were sitting in because we noticed that it was the same area of the waiter that we had before and ironically servicing that section. However, we still decided to stay and give it another chance. We realized that we gave him too much benefit of the doubt as we waited entirely too long for our drinks and soon learned that our food orders never was entered in the system....AGAIN! Like wtf?  Yes, everybody makes mistakes but it's all about COMMUNICATION! If we were told sooner or later about what happened, we wouldn't have been as upset as we were.

Tonight was my 1st visit to this restaurant in 2017 and will most likely be my last. The customer service was not great, not poor, it was non-existent. Staff was more concerned about what they didn't have or what cleanup they needed to do to close the restaurant (closes at 2am, I'm there at 10pm) , then they were about the customers. I stood in the doorway for nearly 20 minutes without being acknowledged (yes. I have used a stopwatch). The entire time, staff is walking around or looking at me from the floor, bar, and kitchen, with no thought about seating me or the other couple beside me.  At this point, two ladies leave the bar, opening up some seats. I seat myself and it's another 3 minutes to get a drink. This wasn't the bad part though. After getting the drink, I was ignored for asking for a menu. Mind you, I just got off work and haven't eaten all day, so I'm quite hungry and cash is burning a hole in my pocket if I can just order some food, there is a guarantees $50 tip. Unfortunately, no food was able to be ordered cause the menu never came. At this point I asked for the Receipt  only to be forgotten. Finally get the needed attention and she won't even print the check, instead yelling the balance across the bar. I was tempted to just walk out, but there are Police stationed in the restaurant. Not dining, no stationed. Terrible experience if you can call it that.

They looked like they had been under the heat lamp for 10 minutes though. Both my salad and hubby's sandwich were missing multiple ingredients that were listed on the menu. My salad was missing avocado, tortilla strips, and cilantro. His sandwich was missing onion straws and pickles, and the lettuce on his sandwich was not appetizing. Our food was brought out by a food runner and not our waiter. Our waiter didn't come over to our table for nearly 10 minutes after our food arrived. When we told him our entrees were missing ingredients, he said, ""oh, I didn't bring out the food.""  No apology or offer to fix it. I had already started eating my salad so asked him to at least bring the avocado out. It never came. Hubby's sandwich was now cold and it just didn't look that good, so he asked for another order of wings. They took forever to come out but looked much better than our original order. At this point we had already been at the restaurant for nearly an hour and a half so we just wanted to get the check and leave.

We were right. The food was decent and so was the service. Nothing to write home about but exactly what we'd expect from a typical chain restaurant. We went on the Tuesday before thanksgiving for dinner, my husband, our 1.5yr old, and myself. We ordered a beverage and entree each for the adults (our child has food allergies so we bring food for her still). Food came out in a timely manner. His entree was excellent, mine was half excellent and half just okay. Server didn't seem too enthusiastic but chances are she is enduring less than $2/hr on a tipped salary min wage and working a Tuesday night can be slow and boring. We were there for food, not to be entertained so what do we care what the server is like as long as we get what we ordered in a timely manner, which we did. She didn't notice that my husband needed a refill on his drink - we did have to flag her down for that, but not a huge deal. Overall decent food and service for a cheap price. We are used to 4 and 5 star, non-chain restaurants. This isn't that. But you know that. It's TGIFridays. It's a solid 3star establishment for food, service, and price.

This franchise has clearly lost their footing when is comes to a dwindling client base. If you'd like to see customer appreciation than checkout their new competitor and neighbors restroom design directly accross the street; called BJ's.  Now not to be too hard on ""Grandpa Fridays""allot of establishments fail to provide the simple luxuray of urinal floor grates but quite frankly it's 2018 damm near. Despite this,  Fridays generated $193.5 MM in FY 2015, has strong branding and the best rewards programs and still fails to provide the basic essentials you would expect from a major brand of such. Very disappointed...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bowie,1.96,1.61,1.61,,1.7500000000000002

The environment was warm and the food filled the plate and was the classic American food I know/love. At some point in time about 5-6 years ago maybe I think Fridays made the decision to become more of a nightlife destination. The food took a back burner in place of sweet, sugary cocktail drinks and late night action. This Fridays is definitely fits that mold.  The food here is alright. It's typical American cuisine with all the normal fixins. Fridays usually runs a variety of specials so keep an eye out if you've got a favorite. I've eaten a variety of entrees and they are all good. Nothing wows me but it is exactly what it is, a little heavy on the salt but at a reasonable price. Their Jack Daniels sauce is alright and most of the apps are good. The food is remarkably consistent. The service from my experience is usually pretty spotty. On occasion I've had okay service but in general it's lack luster. You'll get occasional drink refills but there's just not much attention. I've been in both the dining area as well as the bar and it doesn't seem to change.  I'm not sure what TGI Fridays would like to be, nightclub, bar, family restaurant or all in one. The service has slipped and my experience at this Fridays hasn't done much to change what I think.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bowie,1.92,1.59,1.59,,1.7220000000000002
