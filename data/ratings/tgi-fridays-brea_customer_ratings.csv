262,Stephanie G.,"Fullerton, CA",15,20,3.0,1.0,2012-01-17,Just got off my bartending shift to grab a quick meal and beer at Fridays. Ordered a small beer but they served me a large...ok I can let that slide... Ordered the never ending shrimp deal to get charged for the refills which should be comp'd...ok I'll let it slide. The bartenders busy talking to other off work server regulars. But one thing I always notice...even tho the managers always tell the employees to smile they themselves look like they're so depressed they want to take their own life. Smile!! Not professional! I'll go back to my regular bar. Id give two stars but they probably won't read this review about the managers unless I put one.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brea?start=280,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.724,3.0800000000000005
101,Kelly M.,"Sacramento, CA",920,586,816.0,4.0,2012-03-08,"AMAZING Happy Hour.   I was very satisfied with the food and service at this TGI Fridays.  It was nice to go to such a busy restaurant on a Friday afternoon and get great service.  I ordered the fish sandwich (there is only one on the menu) and a beer. The beers on tap during happy hour are about $3 each and well worth it. I also ordered the basket of fries which are very cheap.   They have lots of happy hour items, but none of them are seafood! I wish TGIF had more options for Pescatarians. However, it's still delicious fare. This location has a great ambiance and fun decor. It is a lot newer than some TGIF locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brea?start=160,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.1200000000000006

100,Jeeyoung P.,"Los Angeles, CA",266,256,591.0,2.0,2012-08-09,"Looks much better on the outside. When we went on a Wednesday night, like 7pm there was a waiting list. We put our name down, even though it seemed like there were at least 20 tables open.. When we got seated after ~8 minutes at a booth, our server got us drinks. I don't like the booth seats because the other diners are so close to us, so there is no privacy and we can literally hear everything they're saying.  After ordering, the food probably took about 10-15 minutes. We ordered: french onion soup fries 2 parmesan chicken  dragon fire salmon My friend got the french onion soup, it looked delicious, but she said it was way too salty. So she didn't finish that. Our chicken parmesan was good. I enjoyed it. It was breaded chicken breast on a bed of cheese tortellini with creamed spinach, side of cherry tomato caprese with mozarella cheese.  As for the dragon fire salmon, the fish itself was tasty. However, the rice came with canned mandarin oranges and weird toppings, and a hugeee side of broccoli. The fish could have been bigger. And I don't know about you, but putting rice with citrus fruit and peppers does not make it taste good, or does it make it an asian dish.  We had to flag down our server for checks and other requests. I don't think I'll be coming back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brea?start=160,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.8240000000000003,3.0400000000000005

I came with my co-workers on Veteran's Day as many of them are veterans and were looking to redeem a free lunch. Not worth it at all. It took about 45 minutes for the food to come out and another 45 minutes to get our bill because this one waitress was so busy trying to get so many different orders and requests. Poor girl but while it wasn't her fault, I still cannot and did not give any tip. Idiot manager. I guess onto the food if after reading this review, you still want to try TGI Fridays out in Brea. I got the Grilled Chicken Cobb Salad for $5.99 and it was freaking tiny. Decent in taste but not worth it on their ""lunch special"".

I ordered the skillet garlic shrimp, which is a 'new' item on their menu consisting of shrimp, garlic, tomatoes and basil with rice and alfredo sauce served on a sizzling plate.

I got the steakhouse burger (at least I think that was the name). The burger was delicious. Cooked perfectly, it was topped with arugula, tomato, a spicy mustard sauce, and cheese. No need to add ketchup here, this bad boy is perfect as is. The burgers are now served on cutting boards with the fries in a parchment packet. I like this change.

The child's Mac n cheese stood no chance as it was half a box of cheap Kraft Macaroni and Cheese   Please don't feed her the real stuff with real cheese.   Only the powdered Mac n cheese for her.      It took awhile before the waiter figured out that we were finished.  It would have been nice if we wanted to sit and relax, but, we needed to go home.  The waiter presented me with the bill.  I was ready to give him my credit card when I reviewed it, and noticed that he forgot about the 20% off coupon that I gave him at the time of ordering.  He came back 5 minutes later to give a revised bill.  With the waiter's track record of disappearing,  I wanted to pay the bill so that we could get out of there.   But, after his mistake, I wanted to take a look at it.  So, he left again and didn't come back for another five minutes.  We finally paid and were able to get out of there.   Overall, it was a ""Meh"" experience.  The food was okay, not great, or inedible.  The waiter was not good.  I wouldn't want to come back here.  Too many other places  that I can go to for about the same price or less.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brea?start=120,3.44,3.12,3.12,2.152,3.2480000000000007

Walking to the seating area of the restaurant, I realized 60% of the tables were empty, and a dozen employees were just hanging around. That didn't stack up right in my head. Our waiter was decent with keeping up on drinks and checking up on us initially. We all had ordered burgers/sandwiches that come with fries. As seen in the picture I put up, there were very few fries. I don't see why a waiter would even bring a plate like that out. He then seemed startled when we expressed our lack of appreciation for the insufficient amount of fries (considering their prices, they could at least prepare the plates to look as they do in the pictures). He responded with a slightly sarcastic attitude, and went back to get a small plate of another serving of fries. After that he didn't seem to care much for our table anymore. He dropped the check off and that was it. The place is pretty clean, and of course in a nice area.

Second time: More excellent customer service from our waiter!

I can recommend the Sizzling Steak & Spinach and the Pineapple Sangria (possibly called something else). I believe it had some coconut rum in it. So tasty. Dangerously tasty. Boyfriend also got steak and was very happy with it as well. We weren't a fan of the Parmesan fries, they were more like potato wedges and I didn't taste any seasoning or cheese. The mashed potatoes would have been a better choice, but I guess that's what I get for letting him choose his own meals. ;) The big complaint: There is NEVER a host/hostess at the front! Why do you even have a podium there if you're not going to use it? Both times I waited 5+ minutes to be greeted and sat, and it was completely empty - no people waiting. The second time I was tempted to call them just to get their attention (the phone is by the hostess's podium, of course).

So when I asked her about my salad, instead of admitting she forgot about it, she said let me check on that, 2 minutes later came out with a quickly thrown together salad with ranch dressing on the side instead of honey mustard like I asked. I got my salad and right after another girl brought out our entrees, which kind of bothered me. My girlfriend ordered the Grilled Salmon with Langostino dish said that the fish wasn't all that great, the rice was clumpy, but the mashed potatoes were pretty good. I got some grilled chicken dish but it wasn't anything special.  The happy hour drink specials are great and definitely worth it, but my girlfriend tried ordering a Jackberry Smash because she saw it on the website.

Issue 2: once sat, none of the servers acknowledged us - we got more ""looks"" from the tables sat after us when it was obvious they ""jumped us"" in line.

Yes, I ordered the Jack Daniel's flat iron steak with mashed potatoes and macaroni and chesse. Also, loaded potatoes as an appetizer and a Jack Daniel's petite steak with parmesan steak fries and ginger coleslaw. Let me just say that their Jack Daniel's sauce is the best! Caramelized onions and that sweet and spicy taste that is sure to make the mouth water. I ordered rare and my husband a medium rare. Both were actually cooked correctly! What?! That is just too awesome. The mashed potatoes is nice and smooth with a hint of cheese (for those who don't like green onions, let the server know). I would suggest to dip it in the sauce as well, but eating it by itself already has enough flavor. The macaroni and cheese wasn't my favorite like Alondra Hot Wings in Alhambra. This had too much oil and the cheese was not a good choice as well. Try not to order this side... Parmesan steak fries was horrible. Salty, buttery, and soggy. Stick with the regular or sweet potato fries. The ginger coleslaw...if you like ginger, then you will enjoy this dish...on the other hand...myself...was an acquired taste.

Chicken had no flavor and the cheese basically burns to the bottom of the sizzling iron skillet.

Then it gets worse I had to wait 15 minutes to get my check! Seriously 15 minutes when it's almost empty wow. Then I get the bill and notice they LIE yes LIE to make you tip larger! Do the math yourself people because this business (maybe company) is shady as hell! So my bill was $21.60 and they do the suggested tip base on percent well 15% suggested was $3.96 according to Fridays math but regular math is $3.24. So 20% suggested was $5.28 but real math is $4.32 wow almost a dollar more.

She was taking the order of the party next to us before she came to ours. And apparently a person in that party was her friend because she was talking to her for a solid 10 minutes about Disneyland and school before she even took her order. It was annoying listening to her have small talk with her friend when our party was ready to order. Additionally, a member in our party ordered a burger that she wanted cooked medium, and when it came, the server said ""here is your burger, WELL-DONE."" The member of our group asked if the burger was well-done or medium, like she ordered it, and the server went back to the kitchen to ask. She came back and said it was like you ordered it, medium. It didn't look medium from where I was sitting but I will give our server the benefit of the doubt. The food was alright, it is what you would expect from a TGI Friday's at any location.

I have to start with thanking TGI Fridays - my wife and I left laughing because of how incredibly terrible our meal was. It was so bad that we just had to laugh.  I won't get into the whys on why we chose to go here on Friday night, but it had to do with nostalgia.   Anyways, we arrive here at 6:30 on a Friday night and have to wait about 5-10 minutes. Not that bad of a wait, but was a bit odd when I was taken back to my seat and realized more than half of the restaurant was empty.  That was the first warning sign. I've always enjoyed the turkey burger here and I ordered that and my wife ordered some flatbread pizza thing.  I was beyond disappointed to realize that they changed the turkey burger. It's not bad because they changed it, it's bad because what they changed it to something that was basically inedible.  The turkey patty is way too big, the texture is really off, and it tastes disgusting. It went from being one of my favorite things on the menu to something I will never ever order again.  After a few bites I just took the patty off and ate the rest of the sandwich without it.   My wife's flatbread pizza was basically a very large tough cracker with dried out cheese and toppings on it. I guess there was some barbecue sauce drizzled, but I got baked into the crust so it did nothing for the pizza.  I know it's flatbread, but it was the driest ""pizza"" I've ever tasted.  It tasted overcooked and old. The table itself was in bad shape, lots of wear and tear and the booth and the table seemed pretty sticky.  All the items on the table were pretty gross too- the ketchup  bottle and the little advertisement thing we're also really sticky and stained. Needless to say, I had to wash my hands a few times during this meal. The one positive I can say is that the employees were all friendly enough. They weren't the most efficient, but they weren't terrible either. I would say service was average and they were friendly.  But that's really it - that's the nicest thing I can say about this experience.  And friendly servers with average service is not enough to warrant another star. Like I said, as my wife and I were walking to the car I said to her, ""Damn that was such a terrible meal!""  She laughed and agreed and we couldn't remember the last time we had such a bad outing at a restaurant.  So thanks TGI Friday's for that moment at least - I guess. Either way if you couldn't tell from the review, just don't do it. Just don't do it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brea?start=120,2.28,2.78,2.78,2.052,2.58

Just got home and the food still didn't have Jack Daniels sauce on it and my steak was so overcooked I can't even cut it with the knife I was provided.

She took our order and it took over 15 minutes to get appetizers and 45 minutes for our food. When we were served our food, 2 of the dishes were wrong and partially cold. Then we had to ask for silverware. Asked several times for a water refill and a glass of water for my daughter. Got the refill but never got the other glass of water. Again, this place was NOT busy when we got there and our server was not the only server so I'm not sure what the problem was.

We had to ask for her to refill our waters.  We had to ask her to place our orders, she was gone for long periods of time, multiple times.  We had to ask her for a kids menu and she gave attitude when I asked and made it known she didn't want to go out of her way to go get it.  It was NY day and we were in the bar area but it wasn't that busy, it was about 2:30 and maybe 10 people when we were there. (It was prior to happy hour.) This was not the first time, nor the second time, we have had shitty service at Brea and this is the reason we don't ever come here. The reason we came today was because we had received a gift card for Christmas. And we will never, ever be back after this episode.  THE KICKER: we waited for our last endless app to come out and our bill and it was taking a really long time (as usual.) I tracked down the bartender who was at the bar to please print our check and I went back to my table to get my credit card. While I was there, the GENERAL MANAGER (it said so on his shirt) came out to deliver our final appetizer. We asked him if we could have the food to go because we had waited so long and he told us no, the endless apps weren't allowed to go. We told him about how crappy the service was, about the 40 mins between ""endless apps"" and he just walks away! He didn't apologize, nothing! He told us again the apps can't be taken to go and He just walked away! Absolutely the worst customer service I have EVER experienced in my life.  We have a 17 month old, we work full time jobs with opposite schedules, we rarely see each other. it is a RARITY, a luxury, for my husband and I to go out to have lunch. We are paying for a service and an experience. We would like to have lunch with a few basic services, and management who doesn't completely ignore us and basically tell us to eff off.  What we should have done was not paid the bill and straight walked out on our tab. You want to be jerks, than I can be one right back. You all should be ashamed.  I will never step foot in your establishment again, you couldn't pay me. You should be embarrassed, TGIFridays. You need to reevaluate and retrain your staff and management.

Also had an IPA, and you really can't go wrong with draft brews.  We ordered a couple of appetizers because they were half price, the jack daniels boneless wings are always good, but the quantity seemed to have diminished over the last couple years.

My friend left is ID and waitress walked off before asking him if he wanted another drink. About ten minutes later, two half dressed young white girls walked. Mind you we still have not received our drinks. I watched the waitress take their order and provide them with drinks. I had to remind my waitress of my drinks and she brought them to use. The table with the young girls had received their food and we are still waiting. While waiting I noticed all the other tables that came in after us were served food and we were still waiting. Just so you know the waitress has not addressed the table since our drinks. I asked to speak to a manager and explained the bad service and guess what our food was out. I sent the food back to the kitchen and explained I am not happy. The manager stated we did not have to pay for our drinks and we walked out. While driving back to work, I called the restaurant to get the number of a regional manager and the manger (same manager) came to the line. I explained by thoughts about the situation and she (Jen) fed me all the coulda, woulda, shouldas. I didn't believe a word out of her mouth but I did explain how I feel it was a race thing. We were two black women amongst all whites. I am not a person that throws the race card around but I definitely feel like this was the situation. Why would anyone wait 45 mins for chicken tenders and French fries after watching numerous people being served? I am not happy at all and I will escalate the situation.

We get our drinks. Then we wait like close to a half hour for our food. We got sandwiches. Nothing crazy.Seriously horrible food. Their food has gone to the shitters. We asked him where our food was and he tells us oh I'll check on it. But yet you were having the conversation of a lifetime for 30 minutes with the other chick. Our food was cold.

They were busy on a Friday night, but our waiter could have totally stopped by to at least see if we were comfortable. Complained to  management she didn't seem too phased by complaints and gave me a generic sorry and walked away. Continued our dinner with no service. Steaks were dry and didn't get tortillas for fajitas until we were almost done with dinner. When checking out was told by  management there would be a discount on our check.

55,Stephanie V.,"Anaheim, CA",332,265,1251.0,1.0,2015-09-14,"I can sincerely say this is BY FAR the worst experience I've ever had! EVER! A troll under a bridge will give better service than our server Chris.  We were there on a Thursday evening and got there around 8ish. The hostess was really friendly and said our server would be Lindsey. We were looking over the menu and 10 minutes later Chris shows up with the worst attitude. ""What do you want to drink?"" There was no greeting or smile. Fine, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. After about 15mins of waiting for our drinks, he drops them off and walks away. He didn't even bother to ask, ""Are you ready?"". ""Do you need another second?"". Nothing. At this point I was just getting annoyed. If you don't want to be at work or hate your job, don't take it out on the guest/customer. Common sense.  Don't get me wrong, he wasn't busy attending other tables. He would literally just disappear every 15 to 20mins.  30mins into our dinner and he finally stopped by our table. I asked him if they offered the refillable appetizers special and ONCE AGAIN he disappeared for about 15mins just to bring the menu. All we wanted were some small bites for the night and we got stuck with a waiter who had horrible attitude. Once he brought the menu we told him we just wanted to order something right then and there, before he disappeared once again.  Just to give a little bit of back ground, the restaurant was almost empty. When we got to the location there was just one other party in that section of the restaurant. By the time we ordered our first meal, which was well over 40mins after we were seated, there were about three other tables. From what we noticed throughout the night, he was only helping three tables, including us, within his section. I always try to be understanding with employees in the food industry, but Chris was just the most unpleasant waiter we've ever had.  Our appetizers finally came in and were brought to us by Lindsey, who was really sweet even though we just had her service for those few seconds. Once we were done we wanted to order some more appetizers, but once again we waited for about 20mins for Chris to stop by our table. We ordered wings and when they finally came in, we asked him for some extra dipping sauce. He never brought the dipping sauce. I will say, the wings were horrible. We just couldn't eat them and in the end we had to return them. Once again, never really happens, but that's just how bad they were. Chris never stopped by our table so we had to track down a worker who was cleaning tables and asked her if she could help us. We asked her very politely if she could switch our wings for something else and have some refills for our drinks. Out comes Chris, without saying a single word to us, and grabs the wings and leaves. 20mins later he drops off our food and leaves once again. I can definitely tell you he was like this with other guests as well since he would never check up on them. What could have been a nice 45min dinner, turned into 1 1/2 hour nightmare.   I'll stick to the TGIF in Buena Park. I don't have to deal with this type of attitude when all I wanted was a nice dinner with my bf.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brea?start=80,2.52,2.39,2.39,2.116,2.442

The shift switch seemed to be what screwed us over. Also, the food was not up to par with the majority of experiences I have at a Friday's. My mom and I ordered the 2 for $20 something deal and split a Chicken Ceasar plus Parmesan Chicken. The salad lacked lettuce and was a small portion and the chicken was on the dry side, but whatever. It is what it is for the price. The Parm chicken was actually much better to our surprise- the mac and cheese was really just not all that. The Strawberry Shortcake dessert was the last straw. From start to finish, way to get my hopes up and down. I'm pregnant, so bare with me here... But I really wanted strawberries.

Coming from someone who was in the industry for 9 years, I'm not just a picky customer. Anyway, our waitress disappeared, our drinks took like 10-15 minutes and when we got them, we thought they misunderstood us because our margaritas tasted like crystal light at best and mostly ice...we thought they were virgins.

95,Tai W.,"Victorville, CA",5,16,15.0,1.0,2016-05-21,"On Friday, May 20th, 2016,  my family and church family went out to dinner to celebrate my nephews college graduation. We went to TGI Friday's in the city of Brea California. We were a large group of African-American families which came together to celebrate his accomplishment at dinner. We arrived at the restaurant and was seated.  We were assigned a waitress name Holly to take our orders. Immediately me and some of my family members could say it's tension from the waitress. We are not sure why she had a bad attitude but we try to overlook it. We begin to order food and drinks, a large part of the party ordered endless appetizers along with a main course meal. Holly made a comment out of the blue that we could not share our appetizers with each other and then Holly disappeared for 25 over minutes. When she finally returned she brought drinks.  When we inquired about the food and how long it would take she commented ""There's just so many of you, it's going to take a while"".  My brother-in-law then asked is it possible for us to get a basket of bread for the table since it's going to take a while for the food to come she replied ""We don't give out free bread!"" So she denied giving bread to 1 out of 25 people because he was very hungry while he was waiting for his food and he needed to take his medication. It took about 35 to 45 minutes for the appetizers to arrive let alone the main courses that we ordered which took even longer. Holly did not pick up one dirty plate from our table so there were dirty plates sitting there the entire time from the time it made it to the plate until after we left. When you have endless appetizers they continue to bring plates we had five plates stacked on top of each other just in one area the table was left filthy! Holly continue to make comments out of the blue that had nothing to do with anything that anyone asked. She was voluntarily making discriminatory comments. Because we had such a large party and the families were separate we are asked for separate checks from the beginning. As each family attempted to pay their check for their family, Holly started collecting identifications from us. I have never been requested to give my identification to a waitress unless I was ordering alcoholic beverage which was not the case because we are all attending church and we do not drink. When she asked for my ID, I refused to show my ID for a TGI Friday bill that was not going to be any more than $40 or $50. I told her that she was being races and discriminating against my party the entire night, I asked her why was she only carding my particular party. I asked her how many other tables did she card that night she had no reply. She stated that she was carding the entire table and I said I know you are because we are black, so you were insinuating that this large party of black people with several different checks for their individual families are paying with fake credit cards for themselves and their children at Friday's for a inexpensive $50 dinner? Really? She stated that it was the policy of all Friday's restaurants. I informed her that I have eaten at Friday's in over 30 occasions and this is never happened to me. I asked for a manager and she never returned with the manager. At this time I was completely fed up with being racially discriminated against and I left the restaurant after paying my bill. We also had to explain to my 11-year-old son what discrimination was and why we were being discriminated against. That night after I arrived home, I could not sleep. I laid in bed tossed and turned and thought about the incident all night. I was having stomach pain's and I had to use the restroom in the middle of the night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brea?start=120,2.28,2.39,2.39,2.212,2.346

But sometimes the day is nice or I have ridden my bike from home to here and just stopped for a quick beer or margarita. Then I choose to be outside. I have quickly found out that they allow dogs out there. That's cool. This way if you are walking your dog you can make this place a stopping point and get a drink. Or if you are a person that can't leave your pooch at home when you go out to eat, well here is another spot you can bring him/her too.  The food is good to ok. Depends on what you order. From simple sliders on happy hour to steam and lobster during the the week at happy hour also. But before 6 pm. Haven't had that yet. But the ribs are great on Wednesday.  There is so much to choose from. You have four all carbs meals to all protein meals. If you are a veggie lover they cater to you as well. I've been here during an Angels game and everyone is cheering. Until they lost. Also I caught one NBA playoff game. They will put it on for you if you ask and if they can get it. Sorry no Dodgers game here either. But you can't get it all.  Drinks , well they can make whatever your little or big heart desires. Fruity drinks foo foo drinks for you know who. Yes most of you girls. Margarita are good. Beers are nice and cold. They don't have many IPAs or dark beers. They do have lots of others in bottles. They do have a nice happy hour special. They even have Pabst Blue Ribbon.   So they have some choices on dessert but I can't recommend one due to that either I'm full of food or beer/drinks. I will assume they are good.   And on Sunday it's Happy Hour All Day. No sad hour on Sunday. Now that the days are getting longer and warmer.

There was a 20 minutes wait even though the restaurant were not busy and there were open tables.  Once seated, we were greeted by our server right away. She was friendly and funny - loved her! She took our drink + food order in a timely manner. Our kids meals came within 10 minutes, however our soup came about 20 minutes after we ordered, while our food took more 30 minutes, maybe even longer than that. While waiting for our food, I witnessed something I've never seen before from eating out. There were a group of 8 celebrating a 16th birthday. They were already done with their meals but was just hanging around chatting. 2 hostesses literally walked right next to the table and called the manager over, then told him there were a group of 10 waiting for that table. The manager then walked up to the group, and asked them if they were going to leave soon because they needed the table. I personally thought that was kind of rude. That group left within 5 minutes.  While I was finishing up my food, the same two hostesses stood right by MY table, then kept looking at us, and whispering. I guess maybe someone was waiting for our table too and they decided it was OUR time to go. We spent maybe ONE FULL hour there mainly because our food came so late. My husband needed to use the restroom while my kids and I stayed at the table to wait for him. The whole time the hostesses kept walking by our table and kept glaring at us to ""check"" if we were going to leave soon. It made me felt very uncomfortable. As soon as we got up...just literally got up from our chairs, the hostesses came rushing back by our area and the busboys took our highchair away and started clearing our table.  I don't think I'll come back again. My server was great, food was good, restaurant was very clean... but I honestly don't like being rushed to leave, especially when I had just barely finished eating my food.

She explained if I changed the time to 5:15 it would be better and if we sat on the patio it would make it easier and it would be no problem. She also said they had heaters out there. Yes they have heaters out there but half of them did not work. So I agreed to change the time and sit on the patio. She said 80% of our party had to be there before we could be seated. I understand that. She told me to call the day of the party to confirm the number for sure. I even understand the point in that and I did. The whole party was there by 5:00 and we let them know. At 5:30 we were still waiting to be seated. We waited 30 minutes to get drinks and only one or two drinks came to the table at a time. It was horrible because we were seated so late people had to order there drink and dinner together in order to get the special price.

We had to have the bar tender track her down to take our orders.  After a lengthy wait for the food, my buffalo wings were small and some of the dozen had hardly any meat (overly priced at $12).  My half rack of ribs were small with decent flavor.

I asked her if she could provide the dates and locations that the card was used and she told me it was an invalid card.  I asked her why she thought it was invalid even though it looks like a perfectly valid card and she told me she doubt the toll-free number on the back and that's what they told her. I paid for with my credit card and then called the toll-free number myself as I left the store. They told me the card was not valid but was used in Virginia last month for $61. Clearly somebody fraudulently used my card.  The most frustrating part of this is how Kylie treated me and made me feel.  She made me feel like TGIFridays could care less about me getting ripped off.  She could care less that I trusted TGI Friday's with my hundred dollars. I hope others will protest this location to show that we don't appreciate as customers being treated this way. I filed a complaint with the corporate office to try to get my $61 back. I'm hoping the corporate office will not only make this right but compensate me for my frustration and waste of time.   Regardless of how they handle it though, I hope people will understand this is how the general manager at this location thinks about us as customers and will consider trying a different restaurant in the area rather than supporting this type of treatment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brea?start=60,2.4,2.4,2.656,2.18,2.4

I ordered a bowl of the French onion soup which is pretty good but the bowl is more like the size of a cup. My friend ordered the bourbon chicken with mac n cheese. His chicken came out served on top of a piece of wood that had splinters sticking out of it. The piece of chicken was so small that the portion of mac n cheese was larger. My boyfriend ordered the Jack Daniels chicken with fries and mashed potatoes. Again, the chicken was extremely small. Not to mention both chicken plates were around the $20 range. For that price they should've gotten a larger portion. The server was super cool and we even joked to him about it. The manager came by the table and in a very attitude filled tone said ""all of our chicken is weighed at 5.5 ounces for each piece so your chicken isn't smaller than any other piece we serve."" She did offer up another piece of chicken for the guys but at that point we just wanted to eat and leave.

3,Anna B.,"Glendora, CA",44,131,84.0,3.0,2017-09-27,"I tried their late night happy hour for the first time on a Saturday evening with a friend. We arrived at TGI close to 11 and opted to sit in the dining room area, since we would more likely receive better service than if we sat at the bar. We both ordered their $6.25 Long Islands (an awesome drink deal and my favorite cocktail). The drink was very well-made and quite possibly one of the best Long Islands I've ever had! Food-wise, we shared their cheap fries deal, fries... $1.50 during happy hour! The basket of fries served to us was huge and enough to share amongst 4 people give or take. They're weren't soggy, yet nicely seasoned with a seasoning that tasted like Lawry's Seasoned Salt. The fries were crispy but not to the point where they were even the slightest crunchy (crunchy fries in my opinion are not appetizing). We also ordered the burger sliders and pot stickers appetizers (prices for all apps are 50% off during happy hour). These two apps looked better than they tasted. The plating presentation was appeasing, however, the beef patties were dry and the pot stickers (definitely the frozen kind) did not taste good and were not piping hot when they were delivered.  I understand that it was towards the tail end of the later happy hour and the kitchen is starting to close up, but they shouldn't put any less effort into delivering exceptional food according to their restaurant standards. Yet, unfortunately these types of mediocre restaurants (TGI and similar chains: Chili's, Applebee's, Red Robin, etc.) are subpar most of the time. In overview, I will definitely be back for more of those addictive Long Islands, as well as trying out more of their appetizing and skipping over the ones I ordered this time around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brea,2.68,2.5,2.584,,2.572

The meal was adequate but almost on par with Denny's. Parts of the steak were gristly and none of it tender.

However, to our dismay, our food was served over cooked and burnt and our appetizer was partially eaten before it arrived to our table. Very disgusting! To make matters worse, when we tried to notify our server, she just ignored us and went to assist another table. The manager did take a portion of our meal off our bill, however we had to pay for a burnt meal that nobody ate. We did not even get to eat dinner! The managers response: take it home to our dog. Obviously, we left the burn and disgusting food at the table. I can't believe how much this place doesn't care about food quality and service. I do not recommend anybody eat at TGI Friday's.

Their customers seem to be pretty low on their priority list! Forgetting of course without us they would have no job to ""hurry up and finish""! 5 minutes after closing I was told if I wanted a little more water I would have to take it to go because they were closing, how much time does it take to have a few more gulps of water,30 seconds or less? This blonde heavyset manager was however a lot nicer to me than this group of kids I saw her deal with last week when I was here.

Not sure exactly what the deal was but we ordered appetizers and they were NOT unlimited. We didn't realize this until we saw our bill. Our server tried to explain and said something about the appetizer needing to be $14 or more? Where does it say that on the menu or promo posters in your restaurant? She charged us happy hour prices so I'm not totally upset, just curious. I ordered chicken quesadillas. I have had better. I expect pieces or chunks of chicken to be infused in melted cheese inbetween a hot tortilla. What I got was chicken covered in spicy chipotle sauce inside a tortilla. I could barely see the cheese let alone taste any of it. The guac was the saving grace but I still couldn't finish it. Good news about not being full from dinner is having room for dessert! I ordered the Oreo Madness and thought it was pretty good. The best part is actually eating the fresh strawberry dipped in chocolate sauce. Mmm so yummy! Oreo everything is great in theory but man it was hard to eat after awhile. I recommend ordering this if you have someone or a small group to share it with. Lastly, Google, Yelp, TGI Fridays, idk someone has got to know what time you close! According to a Google search, this place doesn't close until 12:30am on Sunday; however, just past 10:30pm last night servers came out gleefully singing that they were now closed. I checked the doors but didn't see the hours posted.
