7,Matt G.,"Brick Township, NJ",66,258,3.0,1.0,2012-10-15,"Really not a fan of this particular TGI's.  Not a fan of the whole chain, really - I cringe every time a group I'm hanging out with ends up going to one of these ""Fast food sit-down places"", since I like my food to have flavor, instead of being slathered in cheese and overpowering BBQ sauces, while being forced to listen to obnoxiously loud music.  Anyway... This particular TGI's is one that I'll likely never be returning to.  The reasoning? I've gotten food poisoning twice in my life, and I eat at some pretty crazy places, as well as barely-sanitary hole in the walls.  Both of these times, were immediately after having a chicken dish at THIS location.  The first time was after eating some kind of chicken / cheese concoction that tasted a little fishy - I should have stopped eating it right there and then, but figured it was just a low quality product that this sort of place churns out.  My mistake, and I ended up paying for it later.  I gave them benefit of the doubt, and went back a second time a few months later (stupidly ordering another chicken dish), and was laid out on the couch for 2-3 days afterwards.   I don't know if they have a cleanliness problem in the kitchen, a broken refrigerator, or are simply not cooking the food properly, but I'm not willing to give them a third chance.  The service here is at least decent, although some of the crowd that this place attracts are of the ""rowdy drunk"" variety.  Not a big deal for me, but I can see that scaring off some of the quieter customers.  The food (the ones that didn't make me ill) is typical ""American Fare"", meaning it's likely slathered in about 2,500 calories worth of industrial-grade cheese, fried, and / or topped with a super sweet sauce that covers up the flavor of the meat.   I'll sooner eat the freezer burned burrito that's been hiding in the back of my fridge for the last 2 years, than come back to this particular location.  Shame, it's in a prime spot on Rt 70.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brick-2?start=20,2.468,2.468,2.468,2.468,2.468

The French onion soup is my go to appetizer, and for an entree, you can't go wrong with a chicken dish here. For dessert, the vanilla bean cheesecake is pretty good.  This TGIF is just like any other, so if you are looking for a chain sit down restaurant to eat at, this place is fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brick-2?start=20,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7
18,Bob D.,"Ocean County, NJ",0,8,,1.0,2013-11-20,"Expectations were low to say the least, I mean it's TGI Fridays so you have to be realistic, but for a night out with the kids this should have been fine.... However I certainly didn't expect the gobs and gobs of forgotten food stuck to the walls of our booth complete with milky white splatter (I can only hope it was milk) and tons of crud where the table met the wall.... Onto the food, boneless wings were less then half coated in sauce and therefore no flavor, ordered a burger no tomato with lettuce/onion on the side, I got a burger with tomato on the bun and nothing else. wife ordered her meal with side of tomato mozzarella salad and got loaded mashed potatoes. Kids meals were adequate So if you want filthy stank fermenting unkept disgusting dirty filthy (yes I know I said that already) conditions along with your food coming out not as ordered then I highly recommend this place!

When she came she was not apologetic in being late. She did not inform me of any specials going on either. She took my order and was gone for 10 more minutes before returning with my drink.

They have excellent burgers and fries that are served hot and fresh as well as many delicious salads.  After nine if you sit in the bar area they have a special appetizer menu for five dollars which is a good deal. And of course the drinks are always good here that goes without saying.

20,Monica W.,"Brick, NJ",121,86,805.0,5.0,2017-08-12,"This is my favorite chain resteraunt by far and this particular location is why.  First off, the waiters and waitresses, managers, and staff at this TGIF are fantastic. My mom and I come here often and we love all the servers. Bill is funny, Sandra is sweet, Dan is just the essence of cool, Will is nothing short of professional, and Stefan (seasonal worker) is an MD in training and in my opinion, quite handsome. Shhhh! TG is my favorite manager. If he's working, he always stops to check in your table and says hello. He's a family man and good conversation. He's also an Eagles fan, which is awesome in my book!  Chris, the other manager, is your standard professional. He is friendly and is quick to solve any problem at your table. He's not a birds fan, so I'm bias... so I'll move on to the food now ;) Nothing here is fancy, but it's good food and I've never gotten a tummy ache. I like the grilled salmon with garlic butter, with a side of fresh broccoli and rice. There Cobb salad is also excellent. I ask for extra avocado instead of bacon.  Drinks are great. My mom is a fan of the little black dress Merlot. My dad likes to order their tropical drinks...one of them is called ""lava"" and he says it's the best. I don't drink so I ask for club soda with lots of limes... And they give me like 5.  If you are looking for craft beer or fine wine, this is not the place.  Lastly, become a rewards/stripes member. You can sign up online and then just give your phone number to the server every time you eat. As you collect points, you earn free apps and entrees... yes entrees! As a member you get coupons on the mail for 20 percent off each month, etc. Totally worth it. I would like to see some healthier options but it's a chain and your standard bar and grill, so I'm not going to knock down a star.  This place is awesome.

He made great suggestions, knew the menu well, and offered his input and his humor. It's not everyday you get great service at a local chain, but Bill made our experience wonderful. Hats off!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brick-2,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
