11,Jim T.,"Bridgeport, WV",6,87,20.0,4.0,2016-12-12,I went shortly after grand opening. The food was great. Only negative was it took a long time to get the food. Over an hour before getting food. I would definitely go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeport,,,,,
18,Tammy M.,"Parkersburg, WV",0,1,,1.0,2016-12-16,We've been seated 60 minutes and still haven't seen any food. Five people bussing a table while food dies a slow death under the warming lights.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeport,,,,,
15,Bethany R.,"Rachel, WV",5,6,9.0,2.0,2016-12-22,My chicken sandwhich was good but my fry rations were about the size of a McDonald's small. It came in a big bag that was half empty. It might seem like a trivial thing to be angry about but when I'm shelling out  $13 for a meal for one person I expect more than ten fries. Not to mention the service was incredibly slow. It took forever to be waited on and even longer for it to arrive. Appetizers are supposed to be quick and they took longer than our meals to arrive. I likely won't be back. It's too expensive to sit for an hour and recieve miniscule portions.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeport,,,,,
20,Gene B.,"Fairmont, WV",0,5,,4.0,2016-12-23,"Arrived around 5pm on a Friday.  Parking lot full so was expecting a wait.  Got the pager, sat down, and in less than 5 minutes, we were seated.  Server(Julie) was at our table for drink orders within couple minutes. Drinks came out quickly,  didn't order apps, just our meal.  Being as busy as it was and being open only about a month, wasn't expecting perfect.  My wife got the shrimp and fries, I ordered the chicken and shrimp.  In 14 minutes, our food was sitting in front of us.  Food was hot and prepared perfect.  I'm really glad Friday's decided to locate in this area, as we were needing some different places.  We will return.  Thanks for the great meal TGI Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeport?start=20,,,,,
12,Russell S.,"Belington, WV",19,2,,1.0,2016-12-23,Somehow the food was overcooked and still cold.  The portions were small especially given the price.  Service was snail pace slow and the waitress was oblivious to when her orders were up.  The music was way to loud for any conversation.  I proposed to my wife at the one in Charleston and we wanted some nostalgia.  But I'm never eating at this one again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeport,,,,,
8,Elizabeth K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1,2,,3.0,2016-12-23,"We got seated fairly quickly but our waiter took way too long to come take our drink order. He took our drink and appetizer   When he brought the drinks, he neglected to ask if we were ready to order our meals.  When our appetizers came out, we hadn't yet ordered. He dropped them off and started to leave so I asked if we could order. He didn't ask any of us about what sides we wanted. We had to ask him, again, as he was trying to leave. He already couldn't keep our orders straight 1 minute after having taking them to determine which of us got a side and which didn't.  It then took a good 35 minutes for our food to come out. I got a surprise side dish because he didn't tell me how many I was supposed to get and the kitchen just added something on. They badly over cooked one of our steaks that was ordered as medium-well. Other than that and the surprise sides, everything was prepared as requested and tasted fine.  Definitely more expensive than I was anticipating but over all it was ok. It was just the waiter who was a little awkward and not on top of things at all. He was seemingly never around when we needed something. The place is still pretty new so I'll give them another shot in a few months but for now, I'm not impressed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeport,,,,,
19,Clint H.,"Alexandria, VA",0,2,,2.0,2017-01-18,"The server we had was cool, and provided pretty decent service but the food is crap and overpriced. The fries had obviously been dying in a bowl in the window forever, the burger I got was sub-par for almost $14. Go to one of the independent restaurants down the road.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeport,,,,,
4,David B.,"Morgantown, WV",0,57,88.0,3.0,2017-01-24,The Hamburger was not pink and the fries were not hot. The chicken Tostitos did not have much chicken but it was tasty. The prices are on the high side and it was an OK first time. Problably we will not return until they get their food prep better.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeport,,,,,
14,Rachel O.,"Morgantown, WV",47,27,24.0,2.0,2017-02-03,"We went here today, and let me say every aspect about this place is mediocre. The food was alright, nothing special and not great. My salad came already dressed in balsamic with a side of ranch when I asked for ranch, my mozzarella sticks seemed like they had been sitting a bit before I got them. My fiance got the Jack Daniels burger  and said it was also mediocre. What really made me give this place just two stars was the service. Our waiter waited on us, brought us our food, and then sat down at  the table next to ours to eat his lunch. Along with all of his coworkers. At one point, there were 10 of them all huddled around the table RIGHT NEXT TO OURS eating and talking. And you would think, with our waiter right next to us that he would have noticed our drinks were empty... But he didn't. Nothing about this visit makes me want to return. Such a shame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeport,,,,,
17,Beth B.,"Bridgeport, WV",0,8,2.0,2.0,2017-04-09,"Second time at this location. Should have left when it took 45m for chips and cheese. I'll make this direct, took over TWO hours for our cheeseburgers and cold, brown fries. Burgers were good but that's about it. Lots of angry customers waiting on food. Kitchen was chaos. First time I went it was slow back in January after opened. Worse now. Won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeport,,,,,
10,Chuck C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,3,1.0,5.0,2017-05-25,"Heard bad things about this place when they opened, we got seated right away, got our drinks promptly, I ordered the bacon cheese burger! It was excellent! Cooked exactly the way I asked. My wife ordered the Jack Daniels Barrel chicken and said it was very good! Fast prompt service and great food! Ask for Jill. she's a great waitress, friendly and prompt!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeport,,,,,
3,Madelyn M.,"Hudson, OH",0,12,23.0,4.0,2017-05-26,"Came here for dinner while on a business trip. Good food and close to hotels. Waitstaff was friendly and attentive. Location has a more trendy/newer industrial type feel than some of the TGIFridays I've been to in the past, but that's not a bad thing. It was relatively quiet the date and time I was there (approx 7:30 on a Monday) but all seemed to flow as predicted. Will return here when back in town on business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeport,,,,,
2,Melissa B.,"Shinnston, WV",1,3,1.0,1.0,2017-06-02,"If I could give this place less than one star, I would Everyone, except ONE of the hostesses, we encountered at this establishment was so rude it was unbelievable. It was very busy, but that's not an excuse.  Our server was not accommodating, someone came by our table and threw down silverware and then someone came by and slammed down one of our drinks.  I put cash down on the table for our drinks and we decided to take our business elsewhere",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeport,,,,,
16,Alex S.,"Morgantown, WV",0,1,,1.0,2017-06-10,"The food here, while overpriced, has excellent flavor. Our appetizer came after our meal had arrived and was cold. The waitress offered no refund or half price. She just brought out some cold wings. Not happy with the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeport,,,,,
9,Samantha S.,"Overland Park, KS",0,1,,1.0,2017-06-10,"Arrived here and had two workers say someone will be right with you. Then when someone finally comes to seat us they tell us, ""We just sat like 50 people and the wait is going to be about 40 minutes!"" There was clearly plenty of open seats, maybe even 50. Great first impression, thanks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeport,,,,,
7,Lisa H.,"Fairmont, WV",5,3,,2.0,2017-06-28,The food was good our server was great. The hostess was very unwelcoming. My husband and I will not likely be back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeport,,,,,
13,Paul Z.,"Fairmont, WV",11,11,,1.0,2017-08-02,Found out Saturday that they do not honor the appetizers specials as advertised on TV. Will not go back to this location. Wondering why there were few patrons there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeport,,,,,
1,Hal R.,"Granite Springs, NY",106,21,9.0,3.0,2017-08-12,"I don't like Fridays as a rule but it was close to the hotel and we were tired so how badly can they do a salad? I'm pleasantly surprised. The interior has been completely redone at this location sans the 70s and 80s kitch and it was actually professional. Our food was fine and we each had a good craft beer. The service was very friendly and good. The brand is obviously retooling itself. Good! I won't look for a Fridays in the future but I won't avoid them like the plague any more either. A fine, average experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeport,,,,,
6,Dakotah P.,"Oakland, MD",5,4,,1.0,2017-08-19,If I could give this location negative stars I would. The staff is not the friendliest staff you will ever meet. They do not offer the nationally advertised endless apps. And I've never had a quick experience here. Will never go back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeport,,,,,
0,Michele M.,"Morgantown, WV",38,1,,5.0,2017-08-19,Was really good had the bbq chix salad and my drink was very yummy bartender was very good and gave us a sample of some shot!!we come here often bc it's pretty close to the house and it's a brand new Fridays and we love coming here!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeport,,,,,
5,Natalie L.,"New Orleans, LA",116,1,,1.0,2017-08-23,"Worst meal I've had in a very long time. Ordered the sizzling chicken entree to go. This dish is supposed to include grilled chicken and shrimp, sautéed onions and peppers, cheddar cheese, jack cheese and mashed potatoes. I received two chicken breasts each smaller than my hand, SLICED AMERICAN CHEESE (the kind in the plastic wrap, eww) and no jack cheese. Also pretty sure that the onions and peppers were microwaved (I couldn't even swallow them). I am appalled someone felt this was acceptable to serve. I understand this dish may have been difficult to replicate to go, however, sliced plastic cheese and microwaved onions/peppers are unacceptable. If I could give this place a negative star I would.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeport,,,,,
