39,Julia G.,"Bridgeton, Saint Louis, MO",9,69,51.0,2.0,2013-05-06,"Ate here last Friday night. There were plenty of seats available, so the place was not ""packed"".  We were told our server would be right with us, but we waited about 5 min for her to come and take our drink orders.    We ordered our drinks and had to wait quite a bit for the drinks as well. My husband got up and saw our drinks sitting on the bar. Right after that, his beer was brought to the table, but not my cocktail. Again, the place was not packed so I don't think there was any reason not to be able to get our drinks to us in a timely matter.   Finally got the drinks squared away and ordered our food. I got the Korean tacos and my husband got a steak with potatoes and veggies. My tacos were pretty good but the tortilla shells were tough. Flavor was really good. My husbands steak was cooked more than medium, but it had a wonderful sauce and blue cheese on top, so the flavor helped. We had already been there long enough, we didn't want to complain about the food and have to wait longer.     I would say the experience wasn't awful, but we will try a different TGI Friday's location next time and see if it is better. We had been to this location many times before in the past and had noticed the service was declining. Maybe it's a management thing, but too bad, because it is very close to our home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeton?start=40,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001

I usually leave reviews of the places I enjoy and just leave a bad experience behind me giving the benefit of the doubt to the Resturant that maybe it was simply an off day.  NOT this time!   Very poor service! Order was wrong! (Order eventually corrected, but not without effort) Steak was the toughest piece of meat I've had in a very long time! Management avoided coming around to any of the tables! I noticed other customers were frustrated as well. I really like TGI Fridays...  But I will never return to this particular property.

28,Brent W.,"Hazelwood, MO",7,12,10.0,1.0,2013-05-21,"I actually like TGI Friday's as a chain but this one is definitely the worst of the lot. I have come to this location probably about 5 times in the 8 years I've lived close to it and it has always been a terrible location. Everything about Friday's is off here. Usually a hostess greets you at the door, I have only seen a hostess here once. Usually they try to hit you right off the bat with an alcoholic drink upsell, nope, not here, the server will generally get to you after you been waiting 10-15 minutes and just ask you what you want. Since they take so long to get to you they usually just take your meal order then too. After I get my drink, I'll generally never see my waiter again (someone else always drops off the food) until he or she drops off the check. Seriously, it is a service industry, these people work for tips, why does this location have such terrible service? I've been to the Friday's in Creve Couer and St. Charles and neither of those locations suffer from this same lack of service. It is definitely the worst of the bunch and I hope it goes out of business even though it is the closest Friday's to me by about 20 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeton?start=40,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002

31,Jasmine C.,"Saint Louis, MO",15,3,,1.0,2013-09-20,"In all my years (24 lol), I have never gone to a restaurant where they forgot to put in my order!  I came to this location out of convenience, as I would normally visit the downtown location. When I arrived, we were seated in the back in a cramped, 2-seat booth, despite there being plenty of other tables available. Nonetheless, we ordered an appetizer, sirloin, ribs, and a burger (Stripes reward); I had plenty of questions regarding our meal options since I was redeeming Stripes rewards. After people who arrived after us were receiving their food, I started to wonder where our plates were since we already received the appetizer we ordered. The waitress came to our table to check on the appetizers, asked us if we wanted alcoholic drinks, etc. When I discovered they do not offer the $3 drinks like the other locations, we stuck with our already placed food order.  After 20 mins, she came back to our table empty handed asking whether we wanted to order something else or were we just ordering the appetizer. What?! I couldn't believe she was asking, and we told her we already placed our order. I asked her whether she put the order in and she stated yes (obviously lying), that she was just checking, which made no sense. After a few minutes, the manager comes and tells me he will give me a discount because she got preoccupied and didn't place my order. Can you believe we still waited on the order? I think I waited because I already had a free burger on the bill so everything else would have been pretty cheap lol. Even after they placed the order, it took them another 15 mins to bring the food out, and my steak was bloody on the plate, which I requested medium-well. Still being patient and level-headed surprisingly, I let them take the steak to be re-fired. After waiting another 10 minutes, I left $5.78 on the table, exact change for the appetizer with the discount, and walked out the door.

First of all there is no convenient access and the parking ticket machine was having issues.  We go into the restaurant and wait 10 minutes. We were not greeted. My husband points out the table next to us had to hunt someone down to pay his bill. We then decided the service was going to be way too awful as we STILL had not been greeted.  I went to get my parking ticket stamped so I wouldn't have to pay for parking and found a manager. He was obviously working harder than his servers because he was bussing and cleaning tables.  I told him we were leaving because we had not been greeted in over 10 minutes. I've worked in a restaurant myself for 7 years and our policy was always the guest must be greeted within 1 minute.

The entree salad was another 30 minutes and it was ok at best.  And waited another 20 minutes for our Check. I noticed other patrons looking around for their servers and one got up from her table to track her down.

16,Amanda G.,"Mauston, WI",58,1,,1.0,2016-07-16,"Was sat directly next to an open door leading to a cold pool area. It was extremely uncomfortable. When asked if we could move we were told it was ""crowded"" when we passed four tables that could have sat our party of 5. The solution was then to close the door which inconvenienced the staff who needed to frequently go in and out with food and it was extremely cold about every minute when they did so.  It's disappointing because as a customer who also is familiar with the food service industry it seemed as if the rotation was more important than our comfort.  Whether it was the manager or the hostess who made the decision to close the door and not move us to one of the several open tables, it was definitely not the right call.  Also everything we ordered that had sauce or dressing was insanely over dressed.  Overall extremely disappointing experience and will likely not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeton,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.8280000000000003,2.0

But if you are driving and want food just keep going.  Service is fine. It's about as great as the nearby IHOP but I give this three stars because they have alcohol. Service greatly differs. Sitting at the bar you are likely to get better service. Definitely a step above Applebees but I think Chili's is king with Applebees at the bottom and TGI Friday's steadily holding down the middle. Distant from Chili's but certainly a great deal better than Crapplebees. (I digress) Hosts usually tell you it's a super long wait because they don't want to be bothered. Servers don't want to see you. Like I said sit at the bar and be polite. Tip well and leave. Can walk in from the Crowne Plaza lobby side but the parking lot, validate your parking while inside the restaurant, is adjacent the freeway.  Fries and a burger are what I generally get. Wish you had more fries. More flavor even. Burger is decent. Usually just get a bunch of cheap bud lights and dip. Meh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeton,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96

It started with my server. She was wearing a hoodie, T-shirt and jeans. I didn't even know she worked there -- she looked like she was headed out on a Walmart run. It wasn't until she asked me ""table for how many?"" that I put it together. I thought she was just saying hi to be friendly. The server came by to take orders, then disappeared. I had to flag someone down to get my check after about 10 minutes of waiting after I finished my meal.  The food was typical TGI Fridays -- solid, dependable, but nothing special to write home about. I knew what I was in for and I wasn't mat at the food. But servicewise, this is a definite two-star experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeton,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
