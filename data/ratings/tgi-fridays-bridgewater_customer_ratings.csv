64,Uncle freddy L.,"Bridgewater, NJ",188,120,61.0,4.0,2012-02-18,Well its Fridays. I always get a decent meal here. I enjoy the the Jack Daniels sauces. I will say my last visit I had a great waiter.

60,Pete B.,"Hillsborough, NJ",1,26,,1.0,2012-08-14,"This place sucks so bad (and I used to work there!  and am by no means bitter - I liked working there!)... but I'll be honest.  The food is horrible quality.  I've given it multiple chances since my employement there (which was over a decade ago), with my family, and I've hated it every single time.  The only fairly safe bets are the appetizers (Jack Daniels tower, if they still have it), and maybe the burgers.  Actual dinner entrees though have always been cooked horribly and tasted horribly.  If you want to go to a mid-tier chain restaurant, check out Applebees - not sure about the one in Bridgewater, but the one down 206 in Hillsborough has gotten better and I wouldn't hesitate to try any of their entrees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgewater?start=40,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000005

Nobody came to take our order as promised so i went to the bar. Upon returning, i found lip marks on my glass, so I walked it back up. It happens. The bar tender placed the wine to the side and poured me a new one. I thought it was odd that she didnt dump the wine, and continued to watch. When I got back to the seat, we found pink lips on my daughers soda glass, so back up I went. The bar tender was talking to friends and didnt see me.. I saw her tho.. she wiped the lips from my old glass and placed it in the service bar area. When she came over, the manager was walking by, I told him what I saw, she overheard and quickly dumped the wine and denied it.

52,Dan E.,"Branchburg, NJ",56,861,26.0,3.0,2013-08-04,I would have definitely thought I'd written a review for this place but I guess not.  I probably stop in a handful of times a year to grab some beers.  I'm not a huge fan of the food at Friday's so I usually just stick to the drinks.  I actually think this place has a pretty nice bar area.  Plenty of seating and there are a bunch of TV's to catch the game or whatever's on.  Bartenders are pretty attentive and friendly so you're rarely just sitting there waiting. This particular TGI Friday's has about 15 beers on tap which is a pretty good selection.  I'm pretty sure they have happy hour every day from 4-7 and that includes $2.50 Yuenglings so that makes me a pretty happy dude.  The beer is always ice cold so that's a plus.  I'll continue to stop in when I have a chance.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgewater?start=40,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005

The place wasn't packed for lunch either so i really don't understand. I ordered the Slizzing Chicken Cheese which I get all the time and sadly not slizzing when it came out. I assume the waiter put to he order in with the appetizer so it must've been sitting. Or just simply the lack of attentiveness. It also seems like they updated the menu or messed up my order because it came out with double mashed potatoes instead mashed potatoes and veggies. They do have a home made lemonade which was good for my lemonade loving self.  Overall I'm not excited about TGIF as a whole, it's a chain restaurant with just okay food.

The service is extemely unorganized and my family and I were very uncomfortable with the cleanness. Money is never an issue and neither is good food, but when the restaurant itself is disgusting than that is unacceptable. For example, tables should not be sticky when a family sits down. They should be cleaned properly or just don't clean it at all. The waitors, hostesses, and chefs should all be on the same page. There is no reason for situations like this to happen, especially in a very wealthy area. If there is going to be trashy people serving the people in the Bridgewater area, than I assure you they will not be in business for long. Reviews and the internet are a very powerful thing.

It's a family place for people on a budget and who just want a fun time out where you can be loud and hang out. Nothing more, nothing less. The food and drinks there are both okay. Nothing special has ever made me feel good about the menu there, because it's just the regulars. They do have nice surprises on their menus, but the quality of the food always makes me shy away from having anything. Once I found out about how the food is prepared and comes frozen (which is typical for a franchise/chain) it just doesn't feel or taste great.  If you want a fun time and to just go out real quick, this obviously is a pretty cool place for that, but food wise, don't expect quality or quantity. Which if that's not your style or way you're looking for, then that's okay. No quality place does unlimited food for $10 lol But, enjoy.

Mind you,  we went there on a Saturday at 10pm and the place was empty.

30,Jonathon A.,"Queens, NY",55,118,263.0,1.0,2017-02-22,"Of all the TGIF I've been to  this one at the circle is one of the worst places to order food from. Carefree and incompetent staff along with poor management skills! This location continues to decline and their lack of customer service makes it ever more so convincing.  Every time I palace a TOGO order it's always messed up! Today 2/22/17 I placed an order for lunch for my colleagues and I in the office around 2pm. First and foremost their online ordering was offline so we could not place an order online. I prefer this over calling in due to their lack of attention to details. Spoke with a guy who was at the bar Daniel? Who I had to repeatedly tell my order to as he was too incompetent to follow instructions or listen. Well you get what you deserve for attempting to give these idiots a 3rd chance. Got back to the office and everyone's lunch was in the bag EXCEPT for mine. I ordered a turkey burger, of course the bartender forgot to put my burger in the bag!!! When I called the response was ""I'm sorry, just come back in and grab it?"" Are you kidding me? This distasteful response was the same from the GM Tia, who lacks any proper management skills to handle the issue. The fact that these people are the ones chosen to run  this business, will end up running it into the ground. I def. intend to reach out to their district management team.  3rd times is not a charm and they certainly won't have our business again EVER!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgewater,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

Big mistake. There was no wait to be seated, but once again a long wait to be acknowledged.  Our server was pleasant enough but incompetent.  She ignored our empty glasses and plates, took forever to bring our food, and managed to take my fork and take her time replacing it.  As I write this it's been fifteen minutes since we asked for more pot stickers, and they just arrived.

2,Robbie P.,"Manville, NJ",23,33,3.0,4.0,2017-04-01,"I ate here this Friday for lunch, and it was an excellent meal. I came for endless apps with my girlfriend and our friend. Our waitress was very kind, and prompt with drinks, and refills. There have been a few times here I haven't been so lucky. I tried the three berry smoothie, it was delicious. The apps were mostly perfect. The chicken came out crunchy, and I got to try every flavor. The ""Jack Daniels"" bbq sauce is best on ribs which are not part of the endless deal. The mozzarella sticks were warm and flavorful (I think they changed their recipe because the motz of the last endless deal were terrible). The loaded potatos were good, but best saved for last due to their ability to fill you up, and they can be a little dry which makes them harder to finish. The flat breads were disappointing with only two small bits of chicken for the four pieces they gave, so two pieces had no chicken. Overall I was more than happy with the food, and our awesome waitress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgewater?start=20,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

25,Lauren W.,"Brooklyn, NY",77,224,77.0,2.0,2017-05-15,"Even though my order was wrong, the food here was good. I ordered the bourbon barrel salmon and received the grilled salmon. The grilled salmon, with rice pilaf and spinach, was tasty. My friend really enjoyed her parmesan-crusted chicken, with mac and cheese, and tomato and mozzarella salad. Entree serving sizes were appropriate for one person. We both ordered the Casamigos strawberry margarita, which was delicious. It was sweet and salty, and left you with a buzz after one glass.  Overall, I found pricing to be expensive.  Service was poor and extremely slow. Our waitress disappeared for long periods of time. We were not checked on. I had to get up and ask for cutlery after our food was served. Then, I had ask for plates to be cleared after they had been sitting in front of us empty for a long time.

20,Melissa S.,"Flemington, NJ",149,71,361.0,4.0,2017-07-23,"This Friday's has recently changed their happy hour specials to only apply to drinks. They took away the happy hour food options.  The only discounted food available was the endless apps option.  Even though they advertise the endless apps deal at $10 per person on television, this Friday's location charged $12 per person.  I sat at the bar.  The bar wasn't crowded and there were two bartenders on duty.  I ordered a $3 LIT and the endless apps for $12.  The pace for the endless apps was a bit slower than I preferred.  I felt like I had to chase down the bartenders to put in my next round and there was a lot of waiting in between. They used to give you a full app portion for Round 1 and then half portions for each refill, but this time even the first round was only a half portion.  I'm disappointed with the changes this location has made.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgewater,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
39,Miranda Z.,"Chatham Township, NJ",0,10,,1.0,2017-08-08,"ANYONE WITH ALLERGIES BEWARE!!!! I used to go to this location multiple times a year with no problems. Well I went with a girlfriend of mine Sunday evening, walk in took a solid 15 minutes to even be acknowledged, even though there were plenty of staff and managers walking around (key word walking. It was upset slow tons of open tables). A hostess came and said she'd be right with us then vanished. Fast forward 10 minutes to when a manager came to seat us and we were told to ""hold on while he decided where to seat us"". Sit down took another solid 10-15 for waitress to come over at which point she just said she'd be with us soon (again not busy at allllll), a good half hour after we entered the door she finally got our drinks. (All in all she was lovely and NOT the problem). I told her I'm deathly allergic to fish/shellfish even if cross contaminated. And allergic to dairy. To which she said she'd get a manager (which I believe was the proper thing for her to do). It took 35 MINUTES for this manager to pay attention long enough to find things I could eat. Myself and my friend MULTIPLE times told him how bad my allergies are and he disappeared for a bit then came back and informed us he had spoken to the GM who was by the bar....so a GENERAL MANAGER doesn't feel the need to come handle this situation? I asked for rice and grilled chicken deciding that would be safest. Was told by the manager no to rice because they'd ""have to wash a pan"" are you freakin kidding me?!?!?  Food took another half hour to come out. I took LESS THAN 5 bites and started breaking out in hives!!!!!! (From cross contamination) I was told by the manager that ""well, I tried my best to tell the kitchen about the cross contamination"". AND the middle of the chicken was raw!!!! Anyone with allergies beware!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgewater,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
29,Rico C.,"South Bound Brook, NJ",0,4,7.0,1.0,2017-08-12,I went here on Friday and it was absolutely terrible. I was seated right away but it took 30 minutes for someone to get to the table to ask if we wanted drinks. My friend and got our drinks 15 minutes after then we order endless apps and we got the first batch right away and then it took the sever 35 minutes before the server to get back and ask us if we wanted to put another set in but the entire time we waited we didn't get any refill on drinks. The next batch of endless apps didn't get to the table for another 30 minutes and by then it was 1 hour without any refill on drinks. When the server got to the table my friend asked for another beer and I asked for a water. The server returned fairly quickly but my glass of water had food that was on the glass. It was nasty at the at point we didn't eat any other food and just wanted the bill! It took the server 40 minutes to get back to the table so we could ask the server for the bill so we could pay and leave. This was the most terrible experience I've ever had! I wouldn't advise that your go here on a busy day because the servers here don't take care of you and it's so busy they can't wash the dishes right apparently!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgewater,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

The server came over and didn't know the specials at all. That was already a turn off so we ordered waters. 15 min later he asked if we were ready to order and we went ahead and ordered. We had a chicken dish and I had a turkey burger. The turkey burger was horrid, chewy and there were FAT pieces in the burger .. turkey burgers don't have fat pieces! I was annoyed at that (mind you that I'm already very hungry). The server never came back to check on us until we waved over the hostess to get our waiter! He took the burger back no apology or anything. Not that the food was his fault but it was as if this always happens! If that's the case, then maybe Friday's should improve their food quality.
