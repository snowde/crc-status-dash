0,Maria G.,"Brighton, United Kingdom",36,85,77,4.0,2016-10-04,"Hubby and I went here on a Saturday evening and it was busy, with a 45-min wait. We have heard of their reputable cocktails so we had a couple of drinks while we wait. We both enjoyed our cocktails. We were ushered to our seats and due to the fact that we were both really hungry at that point, we decided to have a starter of nachos to share and a main. He had a medium rare steak and I had a cheeseburger. My only regret is... I shouldn't have filled myself up with the dang nachos (they were good though) so ended up asking for a doggy bag for the remainder of my burger. The steak was well-enjoyed too. It was definitely the belly-buster meal I was looking for. And for the price? It's definitely only for special occassions for us, thus the minus star for affordability. It is such a treat having a TGIF here in Brighton located in the up and coming area of Brighton Marina.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brighton-2,,,,,
1,Rachael H.,"Portslade, United Kingdom",7,160,117,4.0,2016-10-04,"TGI Friday's is a well-known American restaurant chain that has recently opened this new branch in Brighton Marina. As with other restaurants in the chain, it boasts an extensive American menu - including but not limited to burgers, ribs, wings and hot dogs. My husband and I decided to dine at this restaurant last night as we had received a free meal voucher through their mailing list. When we arrived, we were very impressed with the decor. They really have done a fantastic job as it is so modern, funky and absolutely all-out-American! There is even a Harley Davidson motorbike in the lobby - you really cannot beat that. We were promptly greeted by a friendly server who took us to a booth. We were given a food and drinks menu with lots of tantalising options. The server soon took our drinks order but sadly the drinks did take quite a while to get to us. When she returned, she asked what we would like to eat, at which point I asked if they had any gluten-free bread. To this, I was given a very impressive gluten-free menu (not just a list of allergens - an actual menu with gluten-free options on it) and was told that the gluten-free meals were cooked in a different part of the kitchen by different chefs - now that is very impressive indeed! As I chose my meal, I also ordered a 'bottomless' drink. Sadly, this drink did not turn up and I had to ask another server to get me one as the first one had been forgotten about. After what was a little too long a wait, our food arrived. I was surprised at how nice the gluten-free bun appeared to be. It didn't look like a cheap alternative and to my surprise, it also tasted nice too. The burger that I had ordered (a green chili cheeseburger) was very tasty and of good size. The fries that came with it were nice also but I definitely could have done with a few more on my plate. My husband ordered a trio of steak, shrimp and ribs. I tried a little of the steak and of the ribs and I have to say that I was incredibly impressed. They were both cooked to perfection. I was really torn when writing this review as to what star-rating to give it. The service was a little on the slow side but not dreadful. The servers were absolutely lovely, as was the food. What is a major downside for me, however, is that a lot of dishes on the menu are far too overpriced. My husband's dish was £21.99 which I thought was far too much. Had we had to pay for both meals, we would not have got a dish that expensive. Upon reflection, I have decided to give it a tentative four stars as the food really is very good indeed - however, they definitely could do with dropping their prices and speeding up their service a tad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brighton-2,,,,,
2,Dominic H.,"Portslade, United Kingdom",11,67,48,4.0,2016-10-04,"Decided to head here on a Monday night expecting a nice quiet evening in the Marina, however this place was unexpectedly rammed. Not complaining, its nice to go to a place with atmosphere and TGI's has this in abundance.  Being new to the Marina, everything is modern and clean and the décor is great. TGI's will take you straight to Times square with its modern and quirky interior. The tables are spacious and there is a good range of small tables for couples to larger tables for groups.  The menu is a typical American style restaurant menu, with loaded potato skins to hot wings available for starters, and for your main you have everything from Ribs, Burgers, Steaks and fajitas! I decided to be a bit greedy and opted for the Steak, Rib and Shrimp combo. My wife has a gluten intolerance and asked if her choice was gluten free, the waitress then came back with a new gluten free menu that had both gluten and lactose free otions. We both thought this was really refreshing to see as most menus just have a little symbol to denote dietary requirements. The waitress then explained that due to this intolerance the gluten free burger would be cooked in a separate part of the kitchen and brought over by a different member of staff to avoid cross contamination. That is good service!!! When asked for how I liked my steak I asked for it to be as rare as possible and when it came out the only thing I could say was WOW. It was cooked to perfection. So tender and perfect. The ribs with their JD glaze (you have to get something with this glaze it is amazing) were cooked to perfection and fell off the bone and the glaze is incredible. The Cajun shrimps were tasty but I thought there could have been a few more for my liking as the dish is £22. Saying that I would have preferred to seen chicken wings instead of prawns/shrimp as part of the combo. They have an extensive cocktail list with some real original ideas on there as well, although I opted for a pint of Sam Adams, the pints are a bit pricey so I only had the one. My wife got a popping candy cocktail and she thought that was lovely and then she ventured over to the all you can drink soft drinks. This took a bit of time to arrive and each time you want a top up you have to find a member of staff as they do not have a machine where you can top up your own drink...so you do have to wait for a top up, and as the restaurant was busier than expected this wait was quite long. I could imagine on a Friday/Saturday it would be even worse. I would love to give this place a 5 star review as I genuinely had a really nice time there, however I feel some of the options are a bit too expensive for what they are and the service can be on the slow side. Yes my food was nice but it was overpriced for what it was as was my pint. Will I return? Yes I will!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brighton-2,,,,,
3,Matt K.,"Peacehaven, United Kingdom",40,104,294,4.0,2016-11-11,Me and my mum  my sister in law and my neice decided to pop in before going to cineworld lovely decor like an American diner there's even a Harley Davidson inside as you walk in. And a massive display of all different spirits and liquors lots of burgers done in different ways. And other types of food too . I had the Bruce lee burger it had lots of chillies in it  to say it was hot was an understatement nearly took the roof of my mouth off  the food is lovely and the staff are really nice and friendly. It's seriously over priced though. I couldn't afford to come here every weekend. A nice restaurant but shame it's so expensive 8/10,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brighton-2,,,,,
