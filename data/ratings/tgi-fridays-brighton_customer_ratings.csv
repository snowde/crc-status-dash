0,Jerry D.,"Pinckney, MI",5,21,9.0,2.0,2012-06-02,"It's the A-typical TGI Friday's experience...  The food is decent, depending on who's in the kitchen.  The alcoholic drink prices are ridiculous and what's even more ridiculous is after spending a $50 bar tab, they charged me $3.00 for a soda; any other restaurant just gives you a side after spending any amount on bar drinks.  I'll likely find another TGI Friday's if I'm in the mood for their food...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brighton?start=20,,,,,
3,Matt A.,"Brighton, MI",0,3,,2.0,2012-10-10,"Their ribeye might as well be a chop steak. It's probably the chewiest price of meat I've ever felt. It was taken home and given to the dogs. The steak was $17 and they were happy to give me a free $7 dessert to make up for a junk steak. Check your bill, receiving a discount on a dessert will eliminate any 2-for deals. Very expensive for what I recieved.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brighton?start=20,,,,,
22,Megan K.,"Bay City, MI",82,523,783.0,5.0,2013-07-05,"Went here for drinks after my date and I ate dinner.  It was almost 11pm and we pretty much had the whole restaurant to ourselves.  The waitress was really sweet and attentive.  The bartender was fun, he threw bottles and did tricks.  It was a good place to go to talk without having to scream over loud music.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brighton,,,,,
4,Zach H.,"Pinckney, MI",91,4,,4.0,2014-03-10,"Went here for my Mom's and Grandma's birthday. We were seated and served drinks quickly. We ordered two appetizers: the potato skins and the spinach florentine flatbread. Both were delicious. Mom and I ordered small Pecan Crusted Chicken Salad. Both were mistakenly made as larges, but we were still charged for the smalls. Everyone's food was delicious. We got a birthday sundae to boot. Our waiter was nice, but a bit awkward. It seemed like it took him a while to bring the bill. All in all, a great dinner, but nothing special.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brighton?start=20,,,,,
6,Chellie R.,"Dearborn, MI",0,38,,2.0,2014-05-13,"I have dined at this TGI Friday's once before and had a wonderful experience.  However, last Saturday I went with my grown son and not so great.  First of all, we  put our name in and sat at the bar.  About 1 minute later, they sat us at a table inside the bar.  Our server, Megan, approached us and the first thing she did was complain that we already had a drink and that ""throws her off"".  Um, sorry dear, but my son has brought me here for Mother's Day and I didn't realize it was all about you.  My son ordered salmon and shrimp and I ordered Jack Daniels sirloin.  I ordered it medium and it was completely rare in the middle.  I never send food back but I asked for it to be cooked a little more.  It came back only more charred on the outside but still rare on the inside.  I just ate it because I didn't want to cause any waves with Megan.  She never smiled - I guess she never got over the fact we already had drinks when we sat down.  My son left her a 20% tip which I didn't think she deserved.  She never said thank you but made a point to address the two gentlemen seated behind us with a very loud ""THANK YOU AGAIN GENTLEMEN"" as she passed our table.  IF I ever go there again (we have a summer house in Hartland so am not out that way year round), I will be sure to ask to not be seated in her section.  I'd hate to put her out by having to wait on us.  She really ruined what was supposed to be a nice mother-son dinner.  I even said something to the two young people at the door when we were leaving and they said ""Oh yeah, that's just how she is"".  Really?  Well, maybe she needs to find a new career.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brighton?start=20,,,,,
26,Shelly E.,"Guasti, CA",0,2,,1.0,2014-12-27,Your hostess service is beyond horrible!!  It was obvious from the time we walked in that they were incompetent.  A group of 9 people should not be that difficult to accommodate.  Rude and disrespectful to customers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brighton,,,,,
24,Shasha H.,"Commerce, MI",0,4,,4.0,2015-02-05,I love this t.g.I Fridays. Just was in and ordered the steak with shrimp and it was beyond delicious. The service was on point perfect and I would defiantly recommend to others. Even though its kind of expensive but kind of worth it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brighton,,,,,
17,Jim P.,"Howell, MI",6,36,214.0,2.0,2015-05-05,"Came to Friday's on a Tuesday-  I should have gone elsewhere.    Service was slow, it wasn't really very crowded, and the food was pretty industrial, if you asked me.  I tried the Bud light on tap.  That was the best part of the whole meal.   After that, everything went downhill.  The ""Sizzling Chicken and Shrimp"" was a flop.  First, I think it was microwaved, not ""sizzling"".  The chicken itself was very bland, and the shrimp wasn't any better.  I think they put a Kraft American cheese slice on the vegetables.  Say what?   Yep.    At least the mashed potatoes were halfway decent.     Do yourself a favor a skip this place.  There are much better places around Brighton to try to get a good meal. This was a waste if $40 that could have been better spent elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brighton,,,,,
5,Shery A.,"Brighton, MI",0,7,,3.0,2015-05-06,"TGI Fridays, like a lot of chain restaurants, is designed to have a certain experience no matter which location you visit. The challenge for them is maintaining that experience across many stores. A really good location, where the food is prepped correctly and the servers bring it out in a timely manner, will leave a great impression. It's the next time when you walk in expecting that same experience even though you're two states away in a different location that you may be disappointed. Poor cooking and food prep will ruin the whole experience. So will poor service, such as waiter/waitress not showing up at your table often enough or not bring out your plates when they're waiting and ready. If these two things happen at the same time, you're experience is horrific. So with TGI Fridays it goes... I just average it out over three visits for any restaurant. TGI Fridays is above water for me, but it's not a place I visit more than 1 or maybe 2 times in a year. If were consistently awesome, I'd be there a lot more frequently, like once a month.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brighton?start=20,,,,,
20,Yao X.,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",0,18,3.0,1.0,2015-11-04,"I usually like TGI Friday but not this one. I had a waiter tried to keep my gift card that still have a small balance on it. I would rather believe it's an innocent mistake, however his story changed several times while I was trying to explain to him the numbers on the bill doesn't add up. I got my card back at last, but it was truly an unpleasant experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brighton,,,,,
25,Nina G.,"Fenton, MI",0,8,,1.0,2015-11-22,"Restaurant was not busy on a Sunday at 6 pm and we had extremely slow service.  My meal served lukewarm at best and my burger was not ""no pink"" as ordered. Other diners in party very disappointed with their meals. We will not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brighton,,,,,
18,Bolder D.,"Swartz Creek, MI",0,12,,2.0,2016-04-03,"Went last night with my wife and son to meet family.  We asked for a table for 6 people, got a booth for 4, but at 4:00 PM, there wasn't a lot of people so they could have put us someplace else. While waiting for the others, we ordered our drinks, 2 Cokes and a Dr. Pepper and some appetizers..  THe Cokes were very weak and the DR. Pepper was a very light brown and undrinkable.  After a few minutes, we got the attention of our waitress and asked for new drinks as the ones we had weren't right.  She brought back new drinks and appetizers and didn't wait around for us to try them.  The second drinks were worse than the first and we didn't have any flatware to eat with. After looking around for the waitress, we asked another waitress to speak to the manager.  When the manager came over, the first thing she said was ""You don't have any plates or flatware to eat with.  We also informed her that the drinks were unacceptable.  She looked at them and said that she could see that they were watered down and said that she would get new drinks from the bar as they were on a different system.  The drinks she brought back was as expected. After the others arrived, we knew there was no way 6 of us were going to fit in the booth and asked to put 2 tables together for us.  The waitress said that the tables were in different server areas so they couldn't be put together.  A few minutes later, they were putting the tables together. 4 of the 6 people ordered ""Endless Apps"" and the other 2 ordered the New York cheddar bacon burger.  I ordered mine Med Rare and the other was Medium.  After almost 30 minutes the burgers came out, they were both overcooked, around Med Well.  After what we had gone through, I wasn't about to send it back. The 4 that had Apps all said that they were all OK, nothing special. All in all, a very disappointing evening.  I won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brighton,,,,,
19,Shawn G.,"Lexington, KY",22,12,,2.0,2016-04-08,"Took my son and gf here for Friday lunch/dinner after a long week.. To my surprise- the service was horrible- granted it was about 4 pm and dinner servers hadn't come in yet, but I went without drink- my gf and special needs son went without drink (which never happens)- ask for manager- he came and said sorry and as meal came out- my gf order was wrong- my order was cold- sent back and finally after hour n half being there- ate (food was tasty), but was ready to go..  Got bill expecting atleast appetizer being comped and was told- ""I took off your drinks""- umm that's couple dollars- so overall I just don't recommend this location as it was worst experience had in the last month!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brighton,,,,,
15,Greg V.,"Daly City, CA",735,20,23.0,1.0,2016-10-31,We went there two hours before the closing time posted on their door. We stood and waited for ten minutes before leaving as no one came to greet us and there was no signage indicating what to do. There were customers in bar area -  but we saw no staff in that area. There were staff back near the kitchen - but we were unable to get their attention.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brighton,,,,,
16,Jordan L.,"South Lyon, MI",0,7,,5.0,2017-01-10,I seriously love tgi!

7,Sandy E.,"Ypsilanti Township, MI",123,23,9.0,5.0,2017-06-25,"This place is well managed! We all know TGI Fridays is a chain, so we know the food we are going in for is well executed but perhaps not as imaginative as a haute cuisine, but that's what we are looking for sometimes! Nice comfortable foods, mainstream drinks, familiar desserts. This store has all the decor, menu, drinks and the rest that make us love Fridays nationwide, but they also did things service wise that went above and beyond, and reminded me of the service in a high end steakhouse I recently went to. The hostess was waiting for us with the door open when we arrived. This is EXCELLENT above and beyond service.  The server brought more water whenever it was needed, asked if I needed a box, and then boxed my leftovers seamlessly, and seemed to always be there with whatever was needed. Thanks to whoever runs this place for a great experience",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brighton,,,,,
11,Randall B.,"Howell, MI",0,14,,1.0,2017-07-27,"The all you can eat appetizers is a complete scam.  For $10 you get an eighth of the normal appetizer size.  After waiting 20 minutes to get one regular triangle slice of chicken quesadilla that was cut into thirds, I cut my losses and ate at home.  So, 3 of us ate, two ordered $10 apps and my wife had a burger, cost was almost $40.   Complete rip, two out of three of us left to eat at home.  The menu pictures for the all you can eat apps is deceiving on the actual size and that waitstaff say nothing about it.  At 6 pm they should.  Don't order or if you can, get six things at first!   It's a chain so miracles should not be expected, but what they are doing is unfair.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brighton,,,,,
13,Sheila Harrison L.,"Pinckney, MI",39,5,,1.0,2017-08-03,"Worst Friday's ever. Wet table, no silver, no plates, no napkins.  All the waitresses do is say they're sorry.  Terrible, terrible, terrible!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brighton,,,,,
14,Ashley R.,"Brighton, MI",286,8,3.0,1.0,2017-09-25,"Really bad experience all around. The bar area I sat in was practically empty and still had to wait a long time to be greeted/served. Upon ordering my mojito I asked if they used fresh mint I was told ""yes"" and I was sold. Until 4 other guests received drinks before me who had literally just sat down, and than about 7 mins later I was told unfortunately I could not have my drink of choice due to the fact they had no mint  sigh. Lol so I asked for a drink on the menu for happy hour price since only pineapple juice was the difference. But I was told No due to the fact certain liquors (one being a lower priced rum) wouldn't be accounted for. Once I pointed out that the liquors I was asking for were practically the same/lower quality, I was apologized to, and than told yes. Holy moly. The food is point blank terrible. It's frozen microwave type style food. Not worth the price at all. And yet again customers who arrived AFTER me received their food first... all I got was an appetizer platter. I also noticed how they have great specials Mon-Thur. It's practically called FRIDAYS. Why wouldn't you have bombing specials on Friday!?! Lol hello! It's called ""thank god it's Friday"" (I went on a Friday and was disappointed to see it's the only day without a special!) Will not be returning to any TGIF's. And I'm bummed cause I actually thought it was gunna be legit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brighton,,,,,
12,Bigdogg S.,"Fenton, MI",0,24,1.0,1.0,2017-10-22,"Wrost place ever. Over priced, portions are small and wait staff likes to argue with the customers. Place was kinda dirty. Never again. The place was dead not very busy at all. The manager tried to make things right but the damage was already done by our waiter. I would not recommend this place to anyone. TGI Friday's used to be a nice place. I am sure with all the closures they have had is why the prices were so high and the portions were small.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brighton,,,,,
9,Kristin M.,"Hartland, MI",1,63,27.0,1.0,2017-10-30,"Ordered chicken fingers and a Cobb salad for dinner. Cobb salad had brown avocado, raw bacon and something inside the Bleu cheese dressing...

10,Ashley V.,"Northville, MI",0,1,,1.0,2017-11-04,"Wish I could give them a 0. Called to make a reservation around 2pm for 6pm, 12 people in my party. First, I was told I needed to speak to the manager to make a reservation for that large of a party. The phone rang and rang and rang until finally it hung up on me and I had to call back again. The girl who answered the 2nd time took my reservation. Walked in at 6pm, only to be told we had to wait 15-20 due to other large parties without reservations who they did not expect (yes she actually said this to me!). They ask us if 2 tables next to each other was ok, and we said yes. 6:45 rolls around and they take us to our tables, which are a good 10 feet from each other. We left and we won't return to this location. And we began driving out here often because the Novi location majority went down hill. Seems Brighton is as well. So sad, we love Friday's! Spend your money elsewhere!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brighton,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
8,Robin B.,"Whitmore Lake, MI",6,47,12.0,1.0,2017-11-24,"The food had better be out of this world, otherwise this review is going to be pretty bad.  Flash forward, Bad bad bad. It all started with being sat at a dirty table, and then darn near 10-15 minutes for the 1st approach of our server to ask about drinks. Moments prior to that I had made the statement that she had about a minute otherwise I was walking out..., I really should have walked out. She took our drink order and brought them back fairly quick, and then she left again for another 15 minutes. Once again she returned just before we walked out..., we really should have walked out. At this point we've been sitting at our table for close to 30 minutes without placing our dinner order. She shows up and takes it and disappears again. After yet another unacceptable amount of wait time she shows back up and places 2 plates in front of us. The trouble now is that we had ordered the same thing, what she brought was 2 different meals. She returns to the table with the A-1 sauce when we pointed out that this was not two ribeye steaks, it was 1 ribeye and 1 sirloin strip. She struggled with what to tell us as an excuse. Just a different shape, or mine was an upgrade. At this point I interrupt her by saying we ordered 2 ribeye steaks cooked exactly the same. She says she going to talk to her manager, I am now expecting to have the manager come to my table. Nope the same waitress comes back and with a straight face tells us, "" someone picked up your order, and this was sitting in its place."" Ok, my head is dangerously close to exploding now..., So, someone takes the order we placed, you decided that you were going to bring us whatever the hell was sitting in the window with the hopes we were now so hungry, we would now be willing to accept it ?   She looked very confused and a little hurt that we refused and said we were now leaving.  Your manager couldn't even manage to come over to try to rectify a bad situation. Shame on you. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brighton,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
