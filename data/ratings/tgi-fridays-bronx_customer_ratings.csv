131,James R.,"Bronx, NY",0,5,,1.0,2012-01-25,"This place has really gone downhill quick.  We were there today (wednesday 1/25/12 @ 4:30 pm)  and it started off bad from the beginning.  the hostess sat us at a visibly dirty table (there were pieces of food that she brushed off when she put the menus on the tables).  After it became quickly obvious that she wasn't going to clean it, I asked for another table.  She sits us at a 6 person table, then walks away.  Then she returns a minute or so later saying we couldn't sit there since we were only a party of 3.  So, they had someone clean our original table and we sat back there.  Then the waitress had a major attitude problem.  My sons kids pizza was horrible (soggy crusted microwavable).  We're DONE with this dump.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bronx?start=120,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002

133,Alan S.,"Bronx, NY",1,49,,4.0,2012-05-18,"I have never actually been satisfied with a TGI Friday's until this one. I've been to plenty in Manhattan and one in Brooklyn where the food was terrible and overpriced. While I still like the taste of Applebee's food better, the overally atmosphere and better and more efficient service make this a much better option if you're debating between the two. The drinks and food all came very fast. I will dare say this is the best TGI Friday's I've been to, but since to date this is the only TGI Friday's I've ever liked, I'm not so sure if it's that bold a statement.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bronx?start=120,2.128,2.128,2.128,2.128,2.128

The wine glasses were smothered with finger and lip prints and to top it off it had dried food particles in them. As we waited for our wine a different waiter brought us our glasses and they were soaked in water....like really who does that....apart from our waiter, who was great and attentive, this location is lacking cleanliness and food quality.

I asked for a specific bottled beer & after 25 minutes of waiting I was told ""we don't have that, do you want something different?"" I changed my mind to a different bottled beer & another 20 minutes later the server returns with the draft version. I specifically ordered a bottled beer and I have now waited almost an hour for A DRINK & it comes WRONG! At this point we were also almost an hour in for waiting for the food.When a plate actually hits the tablet (I literally mean HIT because that manager on shift dropped the plate on the table & walked away very quickly without even acknowledging or apologizing for the wait or even verifying if that was what we ordered). The food that was DROPPED on our table happened to be something that we did not order and after yelling for his attention three times across the bar room area I decided I had to get up & chase him to give him back the plate he obnoxiously dropped on our table. He comes back and asks ""is this right now? Is it okay if I leave this here now?"" in the most SARCASTIC tone ever! At this point I was ready to walk out of the restaurant & pay nothing because of how irate I was at this point with the blatant disrespect from the MANAGER! On top of this my second order of drinks also never reaches the table, orders continue to arrive incorrect. Because I waited so long for my drinks & food I decided to leave the restaurant, cross the street to Dunkin Donuts to purchases water and a donut while I waited for the waitress to finally acknowledge us again so I could tell her to send everything back and amend the bill for the items that were incorrect & never received. She brings us back the bill with everything on it and things we NEVER ORDERED! I requested a pen from the bartender & pointed out everything that was wrong and gave the bill back to her to be fixed. I SENT BACK THE BILL FOUR TIMES TO BE FIXED! She then began to argue that she was new & had no clue what she was doing...blah!

114,D H.,"Bronx, NY",1,5,,1.0,2014-07-21,"We visited this SAD location on a Sunday. It wasn't too crowded as our wait was only like 5min. We sit down and decide to take advantage of the ""Endless Appetizers."" The Endless Apps were STARTLESS. We ordered our meal the same time we ordered the app thinking it would come out first like it does at any other FUNCTIONAL restaurant. Our meals came BEFORE the app an HOUR LATER. The USELESS manager comes over and tells us that the reason why the apps didn't come out when they should is because ""there's like two people in the fry area and like tons of tickets."" IDGAF! You offer a promotion, MAKE IT HAPPEN! I ordered the pecan crusted chicken salad with an avocado dressing. The chicken was COLD, the lettuce tasted like it just came out of the ground and was UNWASHED, and the dressing tasted like all they did was open a bottle of VINEGAR and pour it all over the salad. I sent it back and just ordered a burger.  The manager walks by the table saying ""we put the order in for your burger, she told me about your salad."" Now you would think, and we even asked for the burger to come quick since my guests were half way through their meal and I had sent back that TERRIBLE salad. This wasn't the case. 40 minutes went by, still no burger. By this time my friend was HEATED and she let that USELESS manager, Cliff (a mid to late 20s African American guy) the reason I described him is because he didn't have a visible name tag on and he hesitated to tell us his name. This FOOL comes back to the table and tries to turn it around and put it on my friend and lecture her about voicing her opinion! He has the burger on the plate and is shaking he is so upset. He says ""we do take care of our customers. we do care for our customers. You shouldn't raise your voice or use profanity."" She said shit ONE time, then apologized for that. Then this fool comes back to the table trying to lecture her like he's her father. NO BUENO! Now she is really pissed, but calmly told this SAD EXAMPLE of a manager that what he is focusing on is minuscule and not to lecture her. He failed us as a manager in many ways. First, the app didn't come out and he sits down and gives excuses about the kitchen and offers to pay for ONE order of fried green beans that were initially ordered as an ENDLESS APP. Second, he didn't stay on top of the kitchen to make sure my burger was made immediately and correctly. Third, he tried to make a scene at the table telling my friend that she shouldn't raise her voice or use profanity, ONE cuss word that she immediately apologized for, and trying to make sure that everyone else in close proximity of our table heard that ""we care for our customers, we take care of our customers"" with a CRAZY PATHETIC attitude. Never ever ever EVER will I visit this SLOW, POORLY SERVICED, HORRIBLY MANAGED restaurant. I will make sure my friends know not to go here as well.

Once again snailed it's way out of the kitchen, maybe a 35-40 min wait but great company and an attentive server made the wait less jarring. The rib was cooked well with this not being a steakhouse, the seasonal veggies were hard unsteamed & lack luster. A few of our sides were placed incorrectly on our plates. Steak was the star of this meal. Our Server was good for the most part. Very polite, partially attentive but looked overly spreaded btw tables.

After 18 minutes I see 5 occupied tables in the dining room everyone staring at their menus. Nobody is being taken care of and there is a lot of ratchetness echoing from the kitchen- loud yelling and singing and screwing around- pans clashing together and dropping on the floor. It sounds like a mix of a rap concert, a broke ass opera, and a severe thunderstorm  in there.  I hope all that stuff being dropped on the floor is getting washed. As far as the behavior, I'm Not surprised- I just wanted to get here before the rush to eliminate that as the reason for it taking forever. 18 minutes later someone came over and she was very nice and professional- just running her ass off because everyone else that works there is fucking off not doing anything. Knowing this, I didn't even so much as utter a word of my frustration. I decided to not leave because after all, I'd probably just end up going somewhere else in the area and waiting 20 minutes there too.  It's been well over an hour and a half - the same 13 people at 5 tables are here, plus another 5 that just came in.

In other words, this deserves NO STARS. I have been working in the restaurant industry for more than 10 years and this restaurant should be ashamed of themselves as it was an absolute disgrace to the Food and Hospitality world.  We were greeted and seated in a timely manner. The hostess walked quickly in front of us and departed without a single word. The menus were broken. Yes broken. The are held together just like a book, but with some short of staples? The pages were holding on at the top corner and the pages would come apart at the top edge like a used magazine. We then waited about 15 mins and yet still no greeting by a waiter. As I stepped aside to go use the bathroom, I told my grandmother that if our waiter comes as I am in the bathroom, to go ahead and order drinks and apps. I opened the door to the bathroom and I stopped in my tracks. As I panned the bathroom, I saw toilet paper ALL OVER the bathroom, soap ALL OVER the sink, unflushed  toilets in every single stall, broken stalls where there was no locks. The bathroom even had a disgusting odor. My urges to  use the bathroom disappeared.  I then walked back to my table and asked my grandmother if our waiter has come and she said no. It was been almost 20 mins and yet not even a ""Hello how are you, I'll be right with you"" My grandmother is 75 years old and I refused to wait any longer. I got up, spoke to the manager that looked a host after gossiping at the front desk about my issue and just said in the most sarcastic way ""Oh I am sorry to hear that."" Without even bothering to fix the problem or wonder who my waiter was. I was not looking for free stuff or have top service, I was helping THEM out by telling them this is bad for their business. And not only that, this is your work place, the place you are when you are not home. You make our work place your 2nd home and you live in this conditions? I can't imagine how the kitchen is.

I ordered flatbread to start, and my boyfriend ordered some food off the menu. About 20 or so minutes later, his food came, but not my flatbread. So I asked the waitress, ""where's my flatbread?"" She then told me, ""oh, the kitchen just told me they ran out of flatbread."" So I'm like ii lemme get the mozzarella sticks and pot stickers. She comes out and is like, ""we don't have anymore pot stickers.""  By now, I'm just hangry as fuck, so I'm like, ""well, what do you have then?"" She goes, ""Mozzarella sticks and potato skins."" So I got that. An hour wasted already.  So after I FINALLY got my food, I ordered some wings, cause I was still hungry. The waitress came and cleared the table, taking away the dishes and my fork. How the hell am I supposed to eat with no fork? With my hands? We're not savages here, miss. Anyways, the bill came and to my surprise, I was charged $12 for food that I did not order nor eat. So I had to flag down the waitress, and wait 10 extra minutes for everything to be sorted out.  I learned my lesson. Never again.

But in the middle of the dinner crowd the general manager screams in the dining area all servers proceed to the back. I love TGIF's but today's experience was the worst. GM Christopher Bowen called his team together in front of the whole restaurant and was yelling at them loud enough to make the whole restaurant quiet and pay attention. He was complaining about endless menu items and not giving people to go food from it. However he started yelling about how they need to make sales and pay the light bill mentioning the amount that needs to be paid. He mentioned they need to pay 46k for the light bill! This is an outrage of spreading company business and treating your employees this way! I felt embarrassed for his team and not only did we feel uncomfortable but the customers around us were complaining and asking for his name to call corporate. I will be coming back but if I see him here or see this behavior again I will not stay or return. When we asked him to come over so we can let him know how we felt about our water down drinks and cold food because the time he took yelling at the team,  He was so unprofessional about it. He clearly has a power trip and needs to treat the team and customers better. He said Are you needing a discount because I'm not giving that",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bronx?start=20,1.6,1.95,1.95,,1.81

Why is my shrimp not cooked properly???  How do you burn mash potatoes???? I asked to speak with the manager and she came once took the cold food only to bring back the food lukewarm.  Never seen her again.  She walked past multiple times and never came back to the table.  Then asked for water only to be told they didn't have any clean glasses.   Watched art least 5 tables that camber after me get served, eat and leave before my first order came out.  My suggestion,  SHUT DOWN FOR GOOD.  Poor service and mediocre food is unacceptable when i have to spend my money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bronx?start=20,1.88,1.95,1.95,,1.9220000000000002

Don't not come here. My wings were uncooked. The ""manager"" took them back and brought me back the same COLD, UNcooked food. This is after waiting 45 minutes. My sister and I ordered at 6:52pm. My cold and frozen food came at 7:20pm. All I got was wings and fries at this point her food has not arrived. She ordered the jack daniels chicken and shrimp. Yes. That should take a little longer. No one wants food poisoning.  Her food arrives at 8:15pm and it was wrong. This arrives after I went to the manager...directly. The same manager who brought me the uncooked food. She is trying to hush me at this point because I asked her if she even watched them give me a NEW order of food or just tossed it around in a hot pan. She looked at me like I had 5 heads and she was caught.  She gave me a half ass apology and said that she would go check on my sister's order and asks if I did the endless wings; I told her yes and are they going to be endlessly uncooked? She didn't go check on my sister's order.  As a matter of fact, she walked passed my table back and forth and didnt say didn't 1 word.  My server brings me MORE cold wings and a new  order for my sister its 8:30pm. The shrimp are RAW. HOW!? I been here since before 7pm. I should have walked right out the door. I am now and leaving this nasty ass food RIGHT here.   Oh. And they just ran out of glasses. I just saw a server dump the contents into a sink and refill it. He didn't even rise it. Shut this place.
