40,Jamie F.,"Ingleside, IL",0,12,,2.0,2013-01-21,used to Go there it least twice a week. Theres a few nice bartenders and then theres employees that lean over the bar and yell about politics in your face.(Chris- I believe) Im sorry but if I serve a paying customer I would definetly not purposely make them feel uncomfortable and tell them that their wrong about republicans vs. democrats. The nice bartenders are amazing def know you by your name(Sometimes- depends if theyre drinking or not)  All in all could be a lot more professional. I dont like walking into a bar and waiting 10 minutes to get greeted because the bartender is making herself a drink or goofing around at other tables. Could be a little more proffessional.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield?start=40,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.728000000000001

33,Wrick K.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,6,,1.0,2014-01-14,"How they can miss the mark so horribly, I'll never know. You'd expect all the corporate training to translate into something close to competence. Negative. Don't get me wrong, everything was done by the book, properly portioned, all drink ingredients poured and measured properly etc. but it was definitely all industry and no service. The entire staff is grumpy and robotic and slow moving (it's actually kind of impressive how similarly terrible everybody is. It's like they use an a-hole cookie cutter.) My most recent experience here almost sent me to therapy. My order and any special request were met with a stare that made me feel like a scum bag. I'm sorry that I asked what the salad dressings were. I'm a naughty boy and you deserve better (can we still be friends?). Everything came out exactly how the menu said it might. Unfortunately, not how I asked for it. I asked for French dressing and it came with ranch. No biggie, let's swap it out, right? NO! ""You SAID ranch."" That was it. No swap. Eat your ranch, idiot. The manager even asked if I requested ranch. I apologized if I slipped and said ranch, but I had to ask a manager to swap my dressing. Needless to say, the rest of the meal was uncomfortable and a second drink was out of the question. I wish I was in to punishment. TGIBDSM Brookfield would be great. Kind of like an Ed DeBevic's for people with daddy issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield?start=20,2.724,2.724,2.724,2.724,2.724
34,Kyle S.,"Minneapolis, MN",3,9,11.0,4.0,2014-01-22,My experience was great overall. Maybe I went on a slow light because many reviews were negative. I sat at the bar and brad greeted me. He was very friendly in a genuine manner which was great.  Nachos were very good. The chicken club sandwich was just okay. The bread seemed a little stale and old. He beer was good and the $3 martini was surprisingly good. I went on a Wednesday and they have three dollar Martina's.  Overall very pleasant experience with friendly staff. They even shake your hand now which was kind of awkward at first but still nice!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield?start=20,3.088,3.088,3.088,3.088,3.088

I didn't think id like those but I did.  We actually had 3 waitresses cuz they were training someone and they were both very pleasant & professional.  They asked us to sign up for free stuff and immediately offered free chips & salsa!  We will be back!  Oh and maybe the Appleton location can take some pointers from brook fields manager!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield?start=20,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.092000000000001
28,Terra C.,"Milwaukee, WI",51,46,5.0,1.0,2014-08-09,"Well I wish I could say that it was ok but I would be straining to say that. The only reason why I would give them one star was because the manager stepped in and tried to fix the issues.  Waitress came over to take our order. We were unsure if we should go with boneless or traditional wings. We asked her option. She was clearly annoyed by this ,cut us off and said she was going to get our water that she forgot. When she came back she asked if we made a decision yet. It was slow in the restaurant so it was not like she was swamped. 30 minutes later we finally received our food. We only ordered appetizers so 30 minutes is excessive. The wings we ordered were cold and they brought something we didn't order rather than one of the items we did. Once we finally got everything we ordered the waitress came over with her hands on her hips asking in a very sarcastic way if the wings were finally ok. It was so off putting we told the manager. She comped one of our appetizers which was nice but didn't really make up for all the issues. Highly doubt I will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield?start=20,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.564000000000001
16,Kelly B.,"Milwaukee, WI",280,530,529.0,4.0,2014-09-08,"I was insanely shocked at my good experience at this Friday's. While I did check the other ratings, they were mostly based on poor service and didn't much reflect the food. I've eaten at my fair share of Friday's and know what I like and don't - so I was fairly confident I could find something to my liking. We were seated quickly and chips/salsa were brought out within a few minutes. Usually this free snack is offered only to Stripes members (which I happen to be) but Mike, our server, admitted to regularly sending them to all his tables to 'tide them over' while looking over the menu. While he said it helped to calm people down if he takes awhile, I liked the touch and we quickly polished those off.  On Sunday it was all day HH, so half off appetizers and cheap drinks. Long Islands were only $3 and still strong. I had... a few. We got the green bean fries as an app - a sort of small serving, but they were piping hot and the wasabi dipping sauce had the perfect amount of kick.  Our entrees were the sizzling chicken and shrimp, and the chicken and shrimp pasta. The pasta sauce had a nice cajun kick to it and was a big portion. The sizzling chicken had surprisingly great flavors, and the mashed potatoes were sooo good! Mike was attentive and friendly without being pushy and insistent. Overall we enjoyed our lunch here, and wouldn't hesitate to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003

10,Jennifer R.,"Greendale, WI",94,286,99.0,5.0,2014-11-18,"Out of the TGI Fridays that I've been to, I would have to say that this one is probably the nicest. It is very spacious, with lots of seating, has a nice bar and a lot of neat decor throughout. The staff is very nice and attentive. Our server was wonderful and really made sure that we were taken care of.  We started out with an appetizer of their mozzarella sticks. We opted to pay a couple of dollars more to upgrade to the endless appetizers. If you know that a regular size order won't do, and if you love the appetizers, I would definitely recommend doing the endless option. It is $10 to do the endless appetizers, and it's actually a pretty good value.  For my meal, I had the sizzling chicken and shrimp entree. The chicken is all natural and marinated in garlic, along with the shrimp. It is served over melted cheese with onions and peppers, and comes with a side of mashed potatoes. It was absolutely delicious!  TGI Fridays also has good drink specials. Make sure to check the drink menu or ask your server what the current specials are. During this visit, one of the specials was $4 Long Island iced teas. It was very well made.  I will definitely be back to this location in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield,2.868,2.868,2.868,2.868,2.868

38,Erik S.,"Ashippun, WI",0,5,,1.0,2015-01-23,"Absolutely horrible service on the night my family and I went. It took 25 minutes to bring out the appetizer. Then..... It was wrong. They took it back, 10 minutes later they bring it back out. 20 minutes later the main meals come out. So it took 55 minutes from the time we actually ordered to get our food. We get done eating, the waiter takes our plates and asks if we want desert. I tell him no, just the check. 15 minutes later I get the check, ITS WRONG. My family goes to wait in the car, while I wait to settle this with the waiter. He finally comes back and I tell him and he takes it back to fix it. HE DIDN'T COME BACK. They turned the lights off in the section I was in and started sweeping. WTF??? 10 more minutes go by and I had to go walk in to the wait station like a crazy man and ask where the F is my check because I'm about to walk out. A manager finally took care of me but DAMN.

30,John R.,"Milwaukee, WI",17,8,,5.0,2015-01-25,"I love this tgi Friday's, I come here with the fiancee at least 3 times a month. The service is always great, always seated quickly (longest wait time on a busy night was only 10 minutes). I don't know what they put in that Jack Daniels sauce, but it is magical! The drinks are very well priced, servers are always friendly and never leave you for over 20 minutes with an empty glass (cough cough Olive garden down the street). Any time my friends from Chicago cone up to visit this is my go to place. I went to a Friday's in Chicago once and it was just okay, but this particular location made be fall in love with them. If I wouldn't go completely broke or have a heat attack from all the great food, I'd eat there every single day. Heck, just from writing this review in starting to get a craving.

Came to this one with some coworkers and I feel like I've been missing out!  They have a club, like Red Robin, where you can get free chips and salsa every time you visit, and sometimes get other deals too.  I recommend signing up for that.  I had a Cobb salad, which was a-okay.  I wish I'd been allowing myself to order other stuff, but I was trying to cool it on fries etc.   I'd really like to come back and try some of their mixed drinks that they have on the menu, though!

The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is nice. Even when it's crowded, it's still not obnoxiously loud, which I, personally, love.  I do have one gripe, however. Bring back shrimp scampi! I don't get why they changed their menu up and got rid of the shrimp scampi that came with the JD ribeye. That's what we were always looking forward to on our visits! Don't get me wrong, crispy shrimp is good...but not scampi good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield,,,,,

We arrive here and get escorted to our table all the way in the back of the restaurant in the center between two families of screaming kids and a group of older folks starring at us and the families all awkwardly. Nonetheless we shook this detail off and proceeded to being waited by one of the most friendliest and most professional worker in this restaurant. I do not recall his name but I give all the props to him for such a turn around! Now, my fiancé ordered the fried chicken tenders and fries while I ordered the Jack Daniels burger with fries. The slush drink that I received with my meal was great, and my burger tasted really good, well seasoned, the sauce was quite sweet, and the fries were well seasoned. My fiancés meal was well seasoned as well, but I personally think there's something missing to it but it was pretty good regardless.  Honestly for the price I would of expected a larger portion or at least an additional side or two.  All in all, wasn't an awful experience, but wasn't the most amazing experience whereas i'd eagerly return for more. Maybe just a stop with friends and family, but not as a regular. Just another chain restaurant, really.  To the server, thank you for doing your best for making my experience that much better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield?start=20,,,,,

We left a Christmas party after 10:30 and needed something to eat having not eaten all day.  Options were slim as we drove towards our hotel in Brookfield, Wisconsin.  Friday's, a venerable chain from ""back when"" was open, and we sat at the bar with average expectations. While the food was far less than mediocre, the service was laughably bad.  What I can't understand is how a server can screw up an order when everything is computerized?  It is virtually idiot proof.  Thus, what is below an idiot? Is a moron equal or less than an idiot?  I ordered a simple Caesar salad, a cheeseburger and plain fries with no salt.  Our server/bartender forgot the Caesar salad, brought fries covered with cheese, and a burger.  He looked as us with bewilderment until a manager happened by, spoke with him, and said the correct fries and the salad will be right out.  My burger was pushed to the side.  About ten minutes later my salad and fries came out at the same time. Is a moron equal or less than an idiot?  I ate my salad, and then munched on my now dry burger and cold fries.  Is a moron equal or less than an idiot? We also asked this same server/bartender for two glasses of water, which he forgot.  I reminded him again, and he forgot again.  He got it the third time.  It was time to get the check and get out of there.  Realizing this bartender/server was missing in action for most of our time at Friday's, I knew I would have to ""flag"" him down.  I got his attention and asked for the check.  He nodded, walked away from us and promptly forgot that I asked him for the check.  Fortunately, he walked by us again, took a look at my incredulous face, and said, ""oops."" Is a moron equal or less than an idiot. The bill came to a little less than $30.00. I gave him a six dollar tip hoping he uses the money for prophylactic protection.  He should not have children.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

3,Tom F.,"Brookfield, WI",0,5,,2.0,2017-12-31,I used to come here all the time. Last two visits have been really bad however in the past 6 months I noticed a slow decline.  Tonight the Bar area had 6 open booths all of them with dirty dishes and no sign of staff. People in the Bar didn't look happy so decided to leave. Other times waiters have been really slow and booths have been dirty. It's a real shame because I really like this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
2,Carol M.,"Las Vegas, NV",168,3,,1.0,2018-01-13,This is the worst Fridays location I've ever been to (including in Mexico & within different states in the U.S). The food was terrible quality and overpriced. We ordered a burger and the meat was dry and hard. Ordered the guacamole & chips as an appetizer & the chips were stale & the guacamole was black. We called the manager over and he didn't even bother to issue an apology he simple said all he could do this was take an item off the bill. We immediately asked him for the bill & got up & left. Highly disappointed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
