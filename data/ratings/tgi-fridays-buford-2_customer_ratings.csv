13,Michael C.,"Lawrenceville, GA",185,28,5.0,1.0,2012-08-10,"I don't like to give bad reviews but I keep going back to this place because others (last night was my parents wanting to go)  SO we went..  My food was EHHH, bland, to much sauce and well just poor quality control. My dad however ordered the soup, salad, and bread sticks and wanted to make it unlimited (menu says ya can for $2) the server said he had never heard of that before but he would check... Dad never got more, the server never asked if he wanted more.. but the check came  we where billed for the unlimited (the server never let us know that we could even get it)  I REALLY don't like this place.. next time someone else wants to go I will just flat out say NO.. I'm not paying another DIME for bad food and pathetic service and quality control... and it looks like from other reviews I'm not alone..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buford-2,,,,,
20,Kat B.,"Banks, GA",9,90,2.0,2.0,2012-08-25,"I should have read the reviews here before we went!   I am giving this restaurant a 2 star only because the waitress was good and the manager understanding and generous.  The food, except for the fried green beans, was awful!   1st, beware of the burger.  It is a pre-pressed water infused frozen patty!  The thing was not a burger.  When they took the pictures of the burgers for their menu they were hand made, like they should have been and as expected from a place which used to sell real burgers.  I swear, when pressed the water came out even though the burger was supposed to have been cooked to well-done.  You cannot cook one of the those fake burgers to well done if you wanted to unless you throw it in the fire! I got the Korean Tacos, not sure where the slaw part was at all, and each taco was lucky to have 4 slices, the size of my thumb nail, sitting at the bottom of the uncooked shell.  We didn't complain about that because the burger was so nasty that it was enough to complain about. Now, you want to order the parmesan steak fries for 99 cents more?  Don't even bother.  You get all of 4 potato wedges, not steak fries, with parmesan shaken on top.  That was an eye roller. Back to the server and manager, I did like our server.  She was very nice.  But my hubby did ask about the burger, sadly not it's pre-cooked state, and she said they have very good burgers and it should ""fill him up"".  I felt a twinge at that moment but never said a word.  When we mentioned the nasty burger to the waitress, she was very quick to asking if we wanted the manager and got him right away. Nice guy for sure just didn't know the correct thing to say so quickly as I kind of jumped him with my words, as his comment was quite eye rolling, and I couldn't help it.  I did keep my voice down and had a smile on my face because I couldn't believe what I was hearing!  All in all I made it very clear that we were not paying for that burger at all.  I wan't going to take any kind of lame offer of percent off like the waitress had mentioned.  The thing sucked and I won't pay for anything that doesn't do what it is supposed to. The manager was great in the end, taking off the full meal plus some.  When leaving I said, while he was holding the door for us, and I was totally smiling and being nice mind you, ""You guys should make burgers the American way.  Get a clump of meat, smash it together, thumb it (so it doesn't rise while cooking), and throw it on the grill."" and his reply was, ""I wish we could."".   It is not up to him but where did corporate go when they decided to cook frozen food?  I'd bet my bottom dollar that most of the ""Pure Angus Beef"" sold there is flash frozen with solution, like that which is  sold out of a neighborhood meat truck!  And I used to love Friday's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buford-2?start=20,,,,,
11,Jennifer M.,"Flowery Branch, GA",1,10,4.0,3.0,2013-01-09,"We just had dinner here tonight, and it was the best experience we've had here yet...though it's still not great. They're all about the Jack Daniel's, and it's just too much. The music choice is - well, it's for a much younger crowd. I'm 38, and the dub step in my ear was a bit irritating. However, we received fantastic service and the food was as good as it could be. It's not bad, but it is over priced. I have a friend who worked at Friday's in Wales. If the Friday's in America were as good as the Friday's in Wales seem, this place would be much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buford-2,,,,,
14,Wendy T.,"Snellville, GA",35,714,606.0,3.0,2013-03-03,"Stopped in yesterday out of convenience and hubby and I hadn't been to a Fridays in forever. We started with pretzel sticks, so GOOD!!! I wanted a strawberry lemonade, but our server suggested the slushie, because it came with free refills and I could try the other flavors. Score one for the server!  Our food was good, nothing special, and our server was great. What was slow was the kitchen. It felt like we waited forever for our food. I would stop in again if it was convenient, but it won't be a destination spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buford-2,,,,,
9,Jessica D.,"Atlanta, GA",322,445,227.0,2.0,2013-05-05,"Ironically, like the others, TGI Friday's is usually never my suggestion. My dear friend wanted to grab dinner after work so he suggested we meet up here since he was craving a burger. The only thing I really like from TGI Friday's is their drinks, especially their shakers. Yum. Food-wise, the Jack Daniel's burger and Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta are my go-to's. Service was alright, though we could tell our waitress was peeved because a big party beside us was being incredibly difficult (saying they don't like any of their food and to get them something else, being loud, and making a HUGE mess that spilled over to the floor). She was also more busy catering to them that she kept forgetting to bring my friend a water, even after reminders, until nearly the end of the meal. Since he was craving a burger, the Jack Daniel's burger to be exact, I ordered my pasta. Both satiated our hunger, and we finished with their vanilla cheesecake. I don't know. This place is just very mediocre to me and I feel that there are better restaurant choices nearby. Food is overpriced for what they offer, but you know what? Yay for a free dinner that night and for free wifi. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buford-2,,,,,
8,Dennis C.,"Norcross, GA",78,114,209.0,2.0,2013-07-16,"TGI Fridays is never my idea of good food or good fun. As a rule; I usually wont eat at a TGI Fridays because many of them have signage against the 2nd amendment posted on the front door. That being said, this location does not. Based on this experience only I would say over all the food was 3.5 star worthy.  My 2 reasons for giving this location 2 stars.. 1st the service inside is sub par. While the location is clean and packed with employees, they all just stand around and seem to be bothered by customers request for such things as, Napkins or Drink Refills. My 2nd reason is also due to the employees. The front door to this location has BIG BOLD LETTERS, NO SMOKING WITH IN 20 FEET OF BUILDING. Yet under the front aweing and standing all in the way of the only usable enterance and exit stood not 1, not 2 but 3 employees all smoking away. All of which seemed bothered because they had to move 2 feet this and that way so 3 children, 2 women (one of which is pregnant) and myself could enter the establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buford-2,,,,,
19,Michael B.,"Buford, GA",45,30,4.0,1.0,2014-01-18,"So we arrive and get seated after a long wait. We wait about 10 more minutes to even see someone. By now we were ready to order. The spinach dip tasted good but literally came with 9 chips.  And it took so long to get it that our steaks were out before we even finished it. So the food runner puts our steaks down and leaves. That's when I realize that we never got silverware. So we finally get someones attention for silverware. My wife goes to eat her steak and discovers it wasn't even the type she ordered. So we get someones attention and they run off to replace it. They bring her another one and if looks right. They leave and she takes a bite of her mashed potatoes and they are cold. She cuts into her 'medium well' steak to see blood red. We get someones attention and ask for another replacement. The waitress had the nerve to blame it on us with ""well I asked you if everything looked fine when I brought it to you and you said yes"". We then complain to the manager and she offered us a free piece of cake. We are not 12. Will never return here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buford-2,,,,,
0,Kristin C.,"Lawrenceville, GA",6,14,12.0,3.0,2014-04-15,"A Review For Vegetarians: To be honest, I'm usually not thanking God when someone suggest we eat at Friday's.  TGI Friday's is not a vegetarian friendly restaurant. Which is slightly odd for the times we live in. Usually restaurants will have a couple of good selections for us peace-loving-tree-huggers (don't judge, cows love us), but no not Friday's. They did have a black bean burger. I was not a fan.  My mom (who is also a vegetarian) usually orders some pasta with meat in it & then sets the meat aside to give to our dog or neighbors.  Meat lovers tend to love it here though.  I hear they have new mozzarella sticks! That's a plus! If you've been reading my reviews, you would know that I love fried food.  The couple of times I've dined here, there has been a clown sitting near the front painting children's faces. Which is good if you have children, but bad if you're terrified of clowns. ; )  Staff: Friendly Restaurant: Clean -2 stars for not considering vegetarians.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buford-2,,,,,

My boyfriend's family comes very often to this location but I try to avoid it because I never get good service anymore. We like to sit in the bar area because we are sport fans and enjoyed the kid free zone. Lately, no matter how busy the bar is we can never get good service. I have worked in restaurant industry for 8 years so I try my best to give them the benefit of doubt but being flat out ignore when you have asked three different people to get the same thing is just annoying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buford-2,,,,,
17,Faz R.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,2,,1.0,2014-07-08,The food is good but when the waitress brought the food she dropped the tray all over us and we had no lunch. The food got all over us and the waitress didn't say sorry even once. I would not recommend this at all. And to top it all off the brought us cold chicken and the waitress said that is how the chicken always is. This is the worst place to eat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buford-2,,,,,

10,Sonam V.,"Lawrenceville, GA",17,41,1.0,1.0,2014-08-30,"The only reason I'm giving this one star is because our bartender/server/hostess, Mike, worked his ass off doing three jobs and managing to keep a smile on his face. Other than that, the service here sucks. We walked in and stood there while the ""manager"" and another lady who worked there, argued about making more money. Finally he got two menus and started walking to a table, so we assumed we should follow him. The lady who asked us what we wanted to drink just disappeared. The bartender, Mike, finally came over to help. I went to the rest room and there were 4 ladies who worked there, arguing over shifts. I had to say excuse me and no one moved an inch.

4,Jai R.,"Atlanta, GA",252,338,159.0,1.0,2014-12-03,"Festivus Holiday starts here.... How to I explain the disappointment in everything that is T.G.I.Friday's???! After a roadtrip for the holiday's it was dinner time, my honey and I decided to stop for dinner at 9p.  I didn't want to be a jerk and go to Mimi's Cafe across the street being that they were going to be closing in 1 hour. I made a HUGE mistake. I will never be nice again and disrespect myself with bullcrap food at TGIF. Everyone in Mimi's Cafe will just have to be pissed should I ever find myself in need of a meal at 9p on a Monday night.  We stroll into TGIF's and stand at the podium waiting for someone to take us to the very open, uncrowded seating available all around us. The cheerleader girl comes up to us, and tells us to sit anywhere especially at the bar. I opt for a booth seat near the bar. We are promptly given menus. Then she skates off to talk to guys sitting on the other side of the bar and anyone that has a drink in their hand. There are about 4 people at the bar, and three filled booths. But clearly the bar was her focus. She later comes to take drink orders. I order water, my guy orders ice tea.  The water tastes like it came from a toliet or fish tank. YUCK! NEVER,EVER, NEVER order water from here.... I flag her down after two failed attempts and order a Sprite, which I'm sure is poisoned by the water but I can't tell over the bubbles.  We place our order... I order the Jack Daniels half rack of ribs and shrimp with broccoli and potato wedges. My guy orders, Sirlion steak and lobster tail with sauteed spinach and potato wedges.  My dish (insert extreme disappointment)... The sauce for the ribs has the jello like substance in it that I guess gives flavor. I honestly assume that the frozen bbq sauce was not warm enough and the jello was a bi-product. The ribs were tough as human flesh (not that I would know) and definitely nothing was off the grill. This shit was microwaved to a tough gray matter. Then the jello sauce was slapped on it. The broccoli which was ""steamed' was like rubber with a hint of green like taste. The potato wedges were ok but still frozen towards the middle. The shrimp which was totally frozen and prebreaded was the only thing edible. But how can you screw up frozen breaded shrimp. Kudos Friday's you have a real kitchen. With a microwave and deep fryer.  The dish I sat across from.... The steak with butter on it, was medium well but had absolutely no seasoning on it. They basically got a steak out of the fridge threw it in a pan then added jello sauce to it. The spinach... HOW DO YOU MESS UP SPINACH??? had two mushrooms, one brown onion and a few sprinkles of cheese to make it seem fancy. I'm not sure how that was cooked. The lobster tail, was half edible and the only decent thing on that plate for a frozen item. Potato wedges weirdly cold in the middle.  Most of all to make thing worse, our bill was frikkin $57.00. We were so pissed we tried to run away but had the hardest time flagging down the cheerleader who only wanted to talk to the guys on the other side of the bar.  After paying the bill, we ran out of there hoping to never see a logo, commercial, or hear anyone say TGIF ever again in life. I have some serious trauma from this experience. Never again.... Never again.... NEVER....EVER...Never.... Please make it all go away... And if you are a TGIF social media manager or spokesperson please do not contact me... I don't want a gift card, I don't want your apologizes. I simply want you to provide better service, better food and a better experience. Or just please do humanity a favor and close down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buford-2,,,,,

I got the 6oz Sirloin filet with Lobster tail and he ordered the Sizzling chicken and shrimp. He liked his but i doubt he was able to enjoy it because he didnt wait for it to cool down door. My steak was yummy and cooked as requested(medium). I paired the lobster tail with rice pilaf and the steak with mashed potatoes. The lobster tail was just okay.  My favorite part of this visit was the prompt seating and our server(Justina). She came to get our drink order right on time and was very attentive.

So she then get a a beer for someone else then moseys over to get my water and leaves empty glass in fronylt of me. And no they are not slammed.

When another couple walked in the manager came and sat us finally. Ordered an appetizer that comes with boneless wings. The wings were so hard I couldn't stick my fork in them and almost chipped  my front teeth!  The burger I ordered was edible. I got a blueberry pomegranate mixed drink which was pretty tasty but definitely didn't have much alcohol in it. I will never go back to Friday's again.

3,Keisha R.,"Atlanta, GA",20,178,181.0,4.0,2015-07-13,"They have SLIGHTLY improved since the last time I came here and since their name change. The service is still quite slow for there never to be any influx of customers, at least when I go, but the food is made to order. I always dine at the bar and the service is usually hit or miss since the bartender often serves the booth area nearby as well. The attentiveness has definitely improved: I was asked by every staff that passed me at the bar if I had everything I needed. It was a nice added touch. I ordered my usual, the sizzling chicken and shrimp accompanied with mashed potatoes and while it wasn't 'sizzling' it was hot, filing and good. Do try the Tennessee whiskey cake, mercy it is so good.  There are a LOT of eateries in this area, so it's good to see Friday's step their game up in order to continue competing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buford-2,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
18,Nicole B.,"Atlanta, GA",0,2,,1.0,2015-08-04,"Let me first begin this by stating that I have been a server/bartender/manager for many years. Tonight was easily the worst service that I have received at any restaurant. First, the hostess was rude while informing us that there would be a wait because it was ""short staffed"". I have no problem with a wait, but your inability to staff properly is not the customer's concern and should be handled professionally. So my party of three decided to go to the bar to get a drink while we waited. It took nearly ten minutes before the bartender even acknowledged our existence much less got us a drink. Now I understand being busy, but a courteous ""I'll be right with you"" would have been appreciated. Once finally at our table, I ordered a medium steak and another glass of wine (Malbec). I had to point to the menu for the server to understand what wine I was talking about. A gentleman ran our food (we did not get our salads first like we asked) and he apologized about our wait. When we asked him about our wine that we still hadn't received, he immediately ""found"" them which leads me to believe that Erika simply forgot to run the wine. Once I cut into my steak I was well aware that it was charred beyond well done. This wouldn't have been a problem had Erika come back to the table prior to the rest of the party finishing their food. By time she came back to check on us (she didn't run any drinks, food, or check on us from the time we ordered until everyone was finished eating), I didn't even want a new steak, I was just ready to leave. She had the manager comp the meal, but the manger did not once come check on the table being aware of the issue since we had to wait another fifteen minutes for him to comp my meal. We saw him walk by several times, but he had no concern whatsoever. It took Erika quite some time to finally cash us out - she never asked if we wanted anything to drink, any boxes, or any dessert. I highly doubt I or my friends/family will attend this establishment again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buford-2,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

We placed two orders of the half rack of ribs, waited about 10 minutes for the server to come back and say they were out for the night, it was literally 8pm and the location closes at 2am on Saturday, how???? Needless, to say having to order something from a menu that you did not come to get is very disappointing but since everyone else's orders were placed, I just went with the flow.  Then, right as we were leaving a couple came in to be seated in a booth. They were brought to the table next to ours which accommodated 7 people and across from a booth that had 4 people. The couple asked to be moved a little further down in an empty booth(there were like 4 avail) and was rudely advised by the hostess that they were not seating anyone in booths..the couple left.
