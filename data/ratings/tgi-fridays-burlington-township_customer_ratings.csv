37,Mike J.,"Lake Hiawatha, NJ",85,429,465.0,4.0,2013-07-20,Your typical TGIF. But the staff was exceptional good. My waiters was very friendly the entire time. The trainee forgot to bring a Strawberry lemonade and ended up bringing two for the price of one. I was having the salad and they kindly asked if I would try a sample of couple items soon to be appetizers. He was training a new waitress and if she takes her training seriously.She too will be a good addition to the staff.  From looking around the other staff member's there does an excellent job. And for our young people. It is nice to see for a change the young making up a great staff and very respectful in performing their jobs towards ALL PEOPLE.

53,Meaghan D.,"Palm Springs, CA",107,87,44.0,2.0,2014-02-09,So the food was pretty generic. Obviously it's a huge chain so that was to be expected. The front of the house host and hostess left much to be desired. They we frantic and frazzled for no reason. Everyone waiting for a table was being patient and waiting their turn for a table. We were told at least 15 minutes which was very annoying as we looked around to see at least 10 tables open In active sections. Some waitresses were coming up to the hostess station (which was u professional as well) asking why they were not being sat. All in all we went here because our local favorite mom and pop place was packed and we were starving.

It took a few minutes for them to find us a booth (even though there were only about 6-7 tables occupied in the entire restaurant). We sat there for 10 minutes. No server. Husband asked the hosts about it and the server came about 3-4 minutes later. He took our drink orders and hadn't seen him until more than 15 minutes later. I could understand if they were busy, but the place was nearly empty! He came out and STILL no drinks....that was about 20 mins later.  We got up and left.... ordered take-out from somewhere else.

My boyfriend and I decided to give this place a second chance after about 6 years, and it is worse than I remember. The only improvement I saw was the decor, that's about it. Long story short: overpriced, poor quality food, not worth the aggravation and disappointment; the waitress we had is the only reasons why I gave 1 star. I ordered a ribeye; it was rotten (had a nasty sour taste) and not even that syrup they call Jack Daniel's sauce could cover that foul flavor. Our appetizers were dried-out and overcooked frozen nonsense, and I'm pretty sure they get their ribs from the scrawniest cows alive. My boyfriend was able to down half his steak-burger, but didn't touch any of his limp fries.  At least they were able to get our drink orders correct, and our waitress was nice enough (hence the 1 star), and don't get me wrong, we still gave her a tip, but we will NEVER be coming back here to waste our hard earned money again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burlington-township?start=40,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116

The bar was packed and the rest of the restaurant too, but that didn't slow down the service. My appetizer came quickly and was great. My entree came perfectly timed after I was done with the appetizer and was fantastic. Grilled chicken with shrimp and two sides.

56,Ed J.,"Browns Mills, NJ",0,2,,1.0,2015-04-20,"Absolutely the worst experience I have ever had at any TGIF.  Visited the TGIF at 2703 Mount Holly Rd. (Rt.541), Burlington, NJ. 08016....on Sunday (19 Apr. 2015) at approx. 2:15 PM (bar area...in a booth).  Service was terrible, bartender (Dan) was taking multiple drink/food orders at the same time; we ordered our dinks and food at the same time (we were a party of 2); Our meal order consisted of one appetizer (Tostado-Nachos) and one burger (Spicy Craft Beer-Cheese Burger). We waited 10 minutes to receive our drinks (two beers), after 30 minutes we had to ask about the chips & salsa we requested when we received our beer.  After 45 minutes our waiter/bartender (Dan) informed us we should be getting our food in a minute or two, after another 5 minutes and watching 2 other tables receiving their food (people who arrived 20 minutes after us), I requested the check and to cancel our order.  The manager (Ashley) came out of the kitchen area and apologized, only saying ""they are very busy,"" when I asked why/how other guest were receiving their orders who arrived after us, she could only say...""we are very busy.""  She wanted to know if we wanted our order ""to go,"" when I say ""no"" she printed and handed me a $15 bill for the 2 beers...we paid the bill and left...I will never step foot into that TGIF ever again.  I'm guessing ""Customer Service"" is not a high priority at this TGIF, it seemed the Manger (Ashley) cared more about getting the $15 for the 2 beers than trying to correct the situation and/or satisfy her customers.  We waited over 45-50 minutes and people all around us received their meals while we just sat and waited.  I know for a fact other TGIF's are really customer orientated...the TGIF located in Brick, NJ, is outstanding...they go above and beyond to ensure customer satisfaction. (Bartender: Dan, Manager: Ashley) should not be allowed to interact with customers or the general public ever...I have never seen such incompetence in a customer service Manager...ever!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burlington-township?start=40,2.08,2.08,2.08,1.988,2.08

To my surprise, we were seated rather quickly. The waitress was very kind from the beginning.

Not in like that pushy annoying way, but in that way that by like your 2nd visit your like is Mike working, cause you need to sit me with him, and by your 3rd visit your like what time does Mike get off cause he needs to sit with us so we can get turned up!  So since it was lunch but I knew I was getting dessert I went light, or at least I thought I did.. I ordered the strawberry fields salad and added some shrimp, Mike advised to double the shrimp but I declined since I figured six was enough, I mean how big could the salad be.  Well it was HUGE, like jumbo, like you know how when u go the the Italian chain OG with a bunch of ppl and they bring out the huge salad bowl to serve the whole table... Yea like ginormously big... but it was delicious! I wasn't mad at the six shrimp cause my company got the unlimited apps for $12.99 which was nice cause literally they had like 9 diff apps on there so yea I was straight.  Ohhhh wait I forgot about my drink, yup so I got they Berry Long Island, which was a first for me cause I usually get their drink with the cotton candy, which is in fact too sweet, or just stick with a glass of wine, but I glanced was looking at it and Mike recommended it so I ordered it and was glad I did it was delish! Ok so dessert time, when it was suggested that we share, I for a split second went into only child syndrome mode (which I am not one at all) but I got it together and recalled it was actually my idea in the beginning I guess before my brain was nourished enough to be working properly.. But alas, out came our vanilla bean cheesecake, looking all sexy and tasting extra delicious.  It was actually just enough because I was filled from the oversized salad and bites of apps and there is no way I could've left a bite on the plate.   All in all it was a great visit, it's nice to find a good Fridays not far from me cause I have to pretend like that one 2 mins from me doesn't even exist.  I'll probably be back and update my review.  I just couldn't see giving 5 stars considering I only really had a salad and dessert.  But service was 5 star!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burlington-township?start=20,2.2,2.2,2.2,2.2239999999999998,2.2

32,George G.,"Trenton, NJ",49,205,451.0,2.0,2015-09-13,"I continue to lose faith in all the big name chain restaurants. Grabbed a seat at the bar to watch the SNF game. The bartender is the regular Sunday night guy (come here a few times to watch the game), he always provide great service. Tonight I ordered the chicken flat bread pizza--how hard is it to get that wrong--it came out in decent time. But it was cold/Luke warm at best!! After a couple of bites, I just couldn't force myself to eat sub-standard food that I am paying with my hard earned money. (If that was the case, I would stay home and force to eat my cooking with my avg skills for free). So I told the bartender and he said he'll have them prep another pizza. I instinctively said yes, but then my conscious and situational awareness kicked in. When he returned from the kitchen, I told him to can that order--I didn't want it and I normally do not eat food once I return it to the kitchen/cook. He was very professional about it, was understanding and asked if I wanted anything else. I told him no and I'll pay for the drinks. He was nice enough to remove the bill completely. A few mins later the kitchen mgr came out (w/ a freshly cooked flatbread), I told her the same as the bartender and she assured me that nothing was wrong with it. I told her that it is my preference, once I return food...I will not eat at that same sitting. She was professional (unlike the mgr at Chilis on Rt 130 in Hamilton), understanding of my concern and tried to assured me that the food was not tampered in anyway.  This is way I am picky on where/what I eat. The quality and pride in the output of a product--whether it is food/merchandise/service--is on a continual decline when the focus is on quantity or a distraction to the primary task at hand. The reason I say that, because it was not a busy time in the restaurant. The usual excuse that the amount of orders the kitchen was handling should not been a factor. So that leaves the impression that the quality or ""give a crap factor"" was not a concern of the person that prepared my food.

Most eateries and bars make their money on making their customers feel special this place makes you feel the complete opposite of special.  This is the place you would take your significant other to tell them you want a divorce or to tell your kids you're putting up for adoption.    Let's break it down.   The decor is your typical corporate, cookie cutter, nothing special.  That along with the vague elevator rock music starts to depress you as soon as you walk in the door.   Next let's look at the beer.  As soon as the bartender asked if I wanted a ""tall"" glass I felt like a chump. ""TALL"" glasses for those that are fortunate enough not to know are corporate gimmick in which they give you a 20 ounce beer and then charge you $8.  To put that in perspective most places charge $2 for a 16 ounce beer ( and even at $2 they're still getting over a thousand percent markup).  Usually the only people that get excited by a tall glass are the guys that are only allowed to have a beer once or twice a year and this is there  special day, to feel like a big shot.  As for the food,  it's Horrible.  It was all freeze packaged crap.  I ordered to pick 3 sampler,   and as soon as I came out I was informed by other customers that they were having endless appetizers for a cheaper price only I had to order it a different way.  When myself and 5 other customers at the bar ask the bartender why he did not tell me this.  He simply shrugged your shoulders saying ""not my problem"",   even going as far to say "" it creates extra work so doesn't like telling the customers""  thanks a lot Tim hopefully I never run into you again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burlington-township?start=20,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.7960000000000003,2.0

I decided to get the turkey burger. I normally don't order a turkey burger from a chained restaurant because I can always tell it was a frozen patty that they just through some seasoning on. I also got a Cesar salad in place of the fries. The food took about 15 minutes to arrive, about average. Everything looked great, until I took a bite. It wasn't the worst turkey burger I've had, but by no means was it the best. I could easy tell it was a frozen patty and the bun was really dry. My server was great up until she dropped my food off. I soon ran out of water and never got a refill. I was thinking about getting desert, but by the time my server finally came back and checked on me, I was ready to go and still thirsty.

For years, whenever I remember, I love to come by this Friday's location and sit at the bar on a Thursday night. I've been doing it for years, mostly because of the bartenders who are there on Thursday nights.  Draft beers are generally what you'd expect, and then they usually have one ""crafty"" beer selection, at this particular visit it was Dogfishhead. My go-to bar snack are their breadsticks, which comes with a few different butter choices (I had the parmesan butter tonight.) The breadsticks are surprisingly filling and they just go great with a beer. We also had some mozzarella sticks with marinara which were good as well.

My son and his family with me in tow, arrived before the dinner rush and were promptly seated, although we had to wait about a half hour for our food to come. I became a bit anxious since I had a plane to catch. The appetizer came and warded off the hungry-ies for a bit, but then.... the wait for the main course made me feel like we should have called in our food so it could have been done upon our arrive. It was nice having family to chat to pass the time.  I noticed the chairs and table as soon as I sat down. Their heights were perfect for short people like myself. Usually, I feel like the table is too high and I need a booster seat, but the ""chair was just right"". I also noticed the condition of the floors, although, they didn't appear messy, they were sticky, from the entry to our table - so I suspect that someone didn't use clean soapy water when mopping the floors from the night before. Once the food arrived everyone seemed pleased. I ordered my mainstay of salmon and would have been pleasantly surprised if it were something different than what I do at home. It was not! So, for $16.00 for about 4-6 ounces of fish, with some steamed broccoli flowerets and 1/2 cup of rice - methinks my meal selection was a bit pricey. I should note that I declined the drizzle of ""butter parmesan"", because I thought it might be too greasy - I did ask if it were real butter to which I didn't get a real answer, hence my decline.  The service was ok - our waitress was pleasant, not especially attentive. She offered no explanation about the electrical power that went OFF during our visit - it was just for a minute or two, (we were in darkness and no background music that had been a bit too loud), but still warranted an explanation - none given. There was nothing positively outstanding about my first time visit to TGI Fridays, nothing that makes me want to return... so this is probably my last. :-(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burlington-township,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

They offer an app and rewards program that's pretty cool and you earn rewards fast. They send coupons for 20% off or for free entrées every once in awhile. Also, you get free chips and salsa for being a member. Recently at this location with a coupon I paid under $20 for a salad, burger and two soft drinks along with our free chips. It's a very good price for when you're not interested in spending a lot.  The major problem with this location is the service. I've had a few excellent servers that really go out of their way to make sure things are enjoyable. However, more often than not service is poor. You wait forever for someone to take your order. On my last visit the chips and salsa didn't come out until after asking twice and our entrees were already on the table.

I put the bag down as I am getting myself back together, grabbing my wallet and keys off the host stand, and she gave a rude look and said ""what, are you checking to make sure everything's in there?"" in a rude tone. So at that point I'm flustered and head back to work. As I unpack the bag, I noticed a side salad was missing with one of my entrees. I called the restaurant to see if maybe I could get a credit. I explained my side salad had been forgotten... first of all, she gave an attitude saying it was very hard to hear me... so I moved out of my office figuring maybe my service was bad.. and the woman says ""it's right here in the window."" I said is it possible I could get a credit, since it wasn't really worth the trip to me for a side salad. She tells me ""no, it's in the window you can come get it."" And then she hung up on me!! My coworker who's salad had been forgotten said his sandwich (the French dip) had no au jus, and was cut in half, one of the half's barely had any meat. Working in a restaurant previously I understand orders can get mixed up, but on a slow afternoon there is hardly an excuse.  Poor customer service ruins the whole experience.  I hope the team learns from this.  Had the woman shown the slightest bit of sympathy for forgetting to pack the salad or had gotten a manager because I requested the credit, maybe I would consider ordering here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burlington-township?start=20,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08

No one cleaned it up until we had food at our tables so we had to move all of our plates so they could clean. The rest of the night consisted of inconsistently cooked apps and a very sad salad.  I think the worst part about the experience was the staff. The hostess was rude. The bartenders lacked customer service experience, never took our plates away, we had to ask them to, never refilled our drinks, we had to ask them to.

We will not be returning to this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burlington-township,1.68,1.68,1.68,,1.6800000000000002
