16,Linda S.,"Canton, OH",3,48,1.0,3.0,2012-10-23,"We usually try to stay away from chains, but decided on a whim to go. The host told us it was a new menu. Good variety. I got the balsamic glazed Caesar salad. Not bad. Some of the chicken was charred too much and it overwhelmed the sweet balsamic flavor. Hubby ordered Jack Daniels skirt steak. Cooked properly but quite small and had to ask for JD sauce for dipping. The Parmesan steak fries were just 3 wedges and the tomato mozzarella salad was made with under ripe cherry tomatoes.  Terrific waitress. Willing to give it another.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton-3,,,,,
17,Patti W.,"Minerva, OH",0,37,,2.0,2013-01-08,"Let's start off with the good things:  the service, the cleanliness and the location.  Well, that's it.  Now on to the food.  The fries are frozen (I swear, one day  I'm going to start a website called ""www.nomorefrozenfries.com"" to shame these restaurants in to using fresh ingredients.  I had a club sandwich and while the ciabatta bread was warm and soft, the meat inside was ice cold.  Most places warm club sandwiches up a little if for nothing else than to melt the cheese.  Not here.  My dining partner (a/k/a my son) had the salmon with lobster.  Even to his 19-year-old palate, he described it as bland and tasteless.  Apparently, he gets his food snobbery from me.  So while the meal was fair, it certainly wasn't what we'd call, ""Good.""  There are better ways to spend $30.00 for lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton-3,,,,,
11,Randy S.,"Hartville, OH",26,125,8.0,2.0,2014-03-22,"Sometimes, I'm embarassed to write reviews for chain restaurants like this.  I think most people know what they are getting at these places so they don't really need to look at reviews for chains.  I used to frequent this restaurant in my teenage years but have only been here on the rarest occasion in the last 10-15 years. The only reason my wife and I went here on this occasion is that I had a coupon for a free meal.  I've decided that's probably the only way I will eat here is if I have a coupon or I'm with a group of people that really want to eat there.  Although if the group of people want to eat there, maybe I should be hanging out with a different group. With all that being said, let's get on to the actual review.  We had great service.  After being told that we would have to wait 10-15 min., we then got seated within a minute.  It's also wise when a hostess overestimates the wait. Our server talked fast and I had difficulty understanding him at times, but that probably has to with my sporadic hearing abilities at times.  He was a very attentive server, but not overly attentive which was perfect. Even the manager stopped by to take our plates and ask about our dining experience.  Let's get to the most important part of the review: the food. It was average at best. Nothing tasted bad. I got the Jack Daniel's burger with fries.  Everything tasted just fine and nothing was wrong with it. I think I could probably buy a pre-formed burger patty from the store and put it on my Foreman grill at home and I wouldn't notice a difference between the 2 burgers.  My wife got one of the sizzling chicken dishes. She ate about half the meal and then requested a box. She said it tasted fine but it gave her no reason to want to come back for that dish.  My biggest complaint was that the box of food stunk up my car and not in a good way. That's not Friday's fault that she didn't finish the meal but it didn't help my experience afterwards. Even when I was younger, I remember liking many of the other chains better than Friday's. I just could never find a particular dish that made me want to come back for more. When it comes to the chain restaurants, this place is slightly lower on my list than places like Applebee's and Chili's, which in my mind, isn't saying much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton-3,,,,,
8,Richard B.,"Akron, OH",25,202,,2.0,2014-06-06,"The Good: It was a beautiful day and seating was available on the patio. The lady got their shrimp/chicken creamy cajun dish, and I got one of their new burgers with bleu cheese and bacon and some other stuff with fries. The good news is that the food was fine.  The even better news, is that as a member of their frequent dining fraternity, we had certificates for free entrees for both, and happily this waitress stated that two certificates per check was the max.   As their were two of us, that worked out just fine.  The lady got peach iced tea and I got standard iced tea. Both were fine.   The Bad: We finished our teas rather quickly as it was warm and we had worked up a thirst on our ride here. Membership in their club generates delivery of tortilla chips and salsa gratis prior to dining, but this waitress never offered or provided same. Unfortunately, we never saw our waitress prior to our meals being served, (to the wrong parties), in a rush fitting of an Olympian sprinter, by a server we had never seen before and who was in far too much of a hurry to check to see if we had silverware, (we did not), or napkins, (we did not), or full drink glasses, (we did not), or a table service tray with salt, pepper, ketchup, etc., (we did not!) Indeed by the time we had switched our entrees, she had cleared the proverbial deck altogether! We waited a spell, and seeing no relief in sight from employees, I got up and stole the service tray from the one table on the patio graced with one, (it was vacant.) I then stole a silverware set from another table for the lady, (my entree, while silverware would have proven useful and certainly a napkin or two indispensable, could be consumed without said service and alas their was only one set available on any of the other tables.) I had finished my meal, and no iced tea or waitress was forthcoming. So I grabbed our glasses and went inside to the service island where the waitresses purportedly fill the glasses of patrons and filled our glasses. Apparently my return to the table with full glasses was the cue for the waitress to magically appear.  (Always show up just as others complete the work at hand.)   She stammered something about how she was waiting for the iced tea to finish brewing in order to bring us refills;  ( a process which was not discernible to the writer and unlikely to be happening with standard tea and peach tea simultaneously), nor did it impede my ability to secure the tea and ice and return to the table.  No stammer was afforded us regarding the absence of silverware, salt, napkins, ketchup and the like...perhaps Heinz was awaiting the maturation of their tomatoes before they made any ketchup, and Oneida was awaiting their steel delivery, etc?   The Ugly: The waitress, was unabashedly attentive, from this point on, (the correcting of the lady's tea which I had filled with standard iced tea, and the fetching of the bill, and checking to see if we had presented payment as of yet.) Isn't this the point when one just goes to the server next to you and ask them to handle the table from now on, in the hopes of the patron's visit being salvaged, in conjunction with the server's dignity?)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton-3,,,,,
14,Brandon R.,"Cincinnati, OH",2,21,,2.0,2014-07-26,I've been once. It was TGI Friday's. Take that for what you will. I like how Ophelia's pictures are the only posted photos and her very personal  portraits are front and center.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton-3,,,,,
15,User F.,"Mentor, OH",0,9,1.0,2.0,2015-03-07,"We had very slow service, and our food was not cooked correctly or wasnt cooked right. My order of wings was very good but I wouldnt come back again.

13,Darci H.,"Canton, OH",0,53,8.0,5.0,2015-12-05,Never let down! Have had Dan as a waiter a few times and he is hysterical and so friendly.  My husband and I go there hoping to get him but be only delivers the food sometimes.

9,Michelle C.,"Massillon, OH",80,12,16.0,3.0,2015-12-10,Food tasted very good but for the price I was surprised at how small the sandwich and fries were. I was still hungry after finishing. Dessert prices were too expensive. No military discount. Server was very friendly and attentive.  Interesting decor.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton-3,,,,,
0,Tom C.,"Columbus, OH",71,334,139.0,3.0,2016-04-07,"Had lunch here with 3 friends while in town for a dart tournament. Your typical TGIF. The staff was nice. And the location was convenient. I had the bourbon grill chicken, which I thought was great. Was perfectly cooked and the bourbon sauce was very delicious. One of my friends ordered the same and she felt the same about hers. Another friend ordered a burger and cooked medium well with no pink, she was a little upset when it arrived with a medium pink center. All in all a decent place and worth another visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton-3,,,,,
7,Lee S.,"North Canton, OH",40,49,68.0,4.0,2016-05-11,"Just had a great get together with parents and in laws. Everyone seemed very happy with their meals. Our son went too and he liked his food as well. I've been to Friday's locations in many cities and this one in my hometown of Canton is still the best! Our waitress was fantastic, while the food took a little while to arrive, the drinks and conversation made us barely notice the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton-3,,,,,
10,Mike Z.,"Canton, OH",0,16,,5.0,2016-08-13,"I love this place. I was quickly seated and the food came out really fast. The server was very kind and helpful.

3,Scott H.,"Navarre, OH",79,81,106.0,2.0,2016-08-28,"2.5 stars.  I always hate starting a review with the negative..unless the place really bombed it so on a positive note.  Our waitress was very good, she kept all our drinks full and was very sweet.         On the downside the food was pricey for what you got, (quality) . And 2 out of 3 steaks came out way undercooked. They sent back to redo but still way to raw. We took home to cook better for dinner.        I want to reiterate that it wasn't servers fault, she apologized and went out of her way to try to fix it but whoever is running kitchen needs to keep better eye on things or learn how to properly cook a steak.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton-3,,,,,
6,Don S.,"Canton, OH",0,1,,1.0,2017-02-26,I've been going to this Friday's for 35 years and last night was hands down the worst service I've ever had at bar. The bartenders absolutely suck I've never been more ignored at an establishment ever. Never seen people look so busy and do so little. Not sure I'll ever go back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton-3,,,,,
5,Lauren L.,"Akron, OH",7,6,1.0,1.0,2017-03-09,It was bad.  Bad service.  Bad everything.  Finally convinced my husband to go here again and now I LOOK BAD. 2 tables left while we were there because they were never greeted.   I accidentally spilled sauce on my pants and the floor.  I went into their host standard grabbed my own napkins because know one was there ( in the middle of Thursday night dinner rush!)    Cleaned off myself and the floor and no one ever noticed?!?  The server was very flustered/ overworked.   I guess there is a good reason why we never go here anymore.  For a dying business you would think that a corporate place like this would step it up.  We will try one of the 50 other places  right next to this location the next time we go out to eat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton-3,,,,,
2,Robert S.,"Stark, OH",0,7,3.0,5.0,2017-04-24,"I ALWAYS sit at the bar.  Food is good, drinks are generous and cheap, the bartenders are awesome (Mike, Ross, etc). Fun place to hang out",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton-3,,,,,
4,John M.,"Hilliard, OH",2,40,10.0,3.0,2017-05-04,"This is hard to write as the service was a 5, but you can't run out of wing sauce and beer on a low key Wednesday night.  I would easily have gone 5 star here, 10.00 all you can say Ap's plus a decent HH, no brainer.  I'm not here for a 5 star filet, I'm here for beer and bar food.  But when you run out of both, that's no good.  I will be back because I feel it was totally isolated but I will also look at other deals.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton-3,,,,,
1,Charley T.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-25,"The absolute worst dining experience of my life.  We went as a group of seven.  Three orders were never filled.  30 minutes after our original order, we were told that they were out of food to fill one order.  Why they waited 30 minutes (when all the other orders were ready) to inform us of this is a mystery.  Another order was placed.  10 minutes later, the original orders were brought to the table.  All were cold and needed reheating.  After another 40 minutes, the second order still hadn't arrived, everyone else had finished eating and our waitress didn't come to our table once during this time.  I had to flag her down to tell her to cancel my order because everyone had finished and were ready to leave.  The manager came out to ask me if she could get me anything.  I told her no that we had already been there almost two hours, I didn't receive either of the orders I placed, everyone else finished and was ready to leave.  She just walked away.  She was rude and completely unwilling to do anything.  Of course the bills were messed up and we didn't receive the take out order that was place with the original order.  Yet another emplyee came to our table to straightened out the bill.  Even Though we wrote out a detailed note as to which orders should be on which of two bills, it took over 20 minutes before she returned with the corrected bills.  We had been there 2.5 hours by this time.  To tell us how sorry they were for their completely incompetent miserable service, they offered one card for a free appetizer on our next visit.  That's it.  2.5 hours of miserable service in which they messed up every aspect of our visit and they expected us to come back for a free appetizer?  We said no thanks and left.  As I was leaving, the older couple at the table next to us, told the assistant manager that handled our bill that their service was very slow and the food was cold.  She told them she was sorry and walked away.  Avoid this place.  It is too expensive to be treated this way!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton-3,,,,,
