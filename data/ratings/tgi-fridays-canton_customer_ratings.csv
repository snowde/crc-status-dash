23,Jadranka H.,"Birmingham, MI",611,167,1228.0,2.0,2013-03-04,"Couldn't remember the last time I visited TGI Fridays, now I know.  We sat there almost 15 min before we were greeted, however I was entertained by the other servers talking about their plans for the night. Finally, we got a server! Put our order in, and the food slowly trickled on the table as it should, but we were missing silverware, plates, dressing, the list goes on. You know there's a problem when the manager is taking and bringing orders, but no worries, the servers are planning their awesome night!  Had to send my sandwich back, it wasn't done the way I ordered it, but it came back missing my side condiments.

43,Andie F.,"Plymouth, MI",0,28,26.0,2.0,2013-04-28,"Worst experience EVER today. Went in about 2:30 in the afternoon for a late lunch. Waited a bit long to order beverages, but not a big deal. Ordered an app. Then ordered food a few mins later. App arrived, no issues. (Thumb twiddle) After 40 minites, I had to ask a host to find our server (who had NEVER came back to check on us).  Our server came and asked what we needed (did not even notice we had NO FOOD) & I asked how much longer until we receive our food and she acted SURPRISED that we still didn't have it. (I saw SEVERAL tables beong served their food).  She returned & said there was an error & our order didn't go through to the kitchen.  I said I wanted to leave & asked for the check & the mgr. I told the manager, D'Andre (sp?) Lewis, our story & he was very kind & understanding.  He went to check on our food, which he said he'd comp for us (more waiting), & came back to say the server STILL never put our order through (WTH?!?) so he'd give me vouchers for a free appetizer next time we come in. I'm also disappointed that for over an hour of my time and hunger and all we were offered was a free appetizer card.  At this point, I'm not sure we'll ever go back. Majorly bummed about this experience. AND STILL HUNGRY!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton?start=40,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12

20,Trina L.,"Ypsilanti Township, MI",15,9,12.0,1.0,2014-03-30,"Ordered a ribeye steak and 10 minutes later, our server informed me that their ribeye steak was frozen and they're unable to serve any at the moment. The manager informed us that they do indeed have the product but it wasn't seasoned so they are unable to sell it. It would have been nice for the kitchen manager to communicate that information with their server (who was awesome, by the way!), that way they can tell customers right off the bat that the product is not available at the moment. I ended up ordering a sirloin steak with shrimp, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley. I also ordered a cup of broccoli cheese soup, but when I took a bite, it had a freezer-burnt after taste which was really unpleasant.  I usually love TGIF's but I might not be coming back to this particular location for awhile.

I didn't care much for the hostess as we entered.   Actually there was no one to greet us.  We stood there maybe 5 minutes before this lady came from the bar area.  I asked if the tables open in the bar area is first come first serve and she said no.  There were 4 open tables yet a wait for dining area of 45 minutes.  She asked 2 couples if they wanted wanted to sit at those tables instead of wait for a table in the dining area and of course they said yes.  I proceeded to the bar for a glass of wine and asked the bartender if we could have the empty table that seated 6 cause we were a party of 4 and he said ABSOLUTELY.  He didnt understand why the greeter lady was making us wait for a dining room table.  All the others who were waiting for a table were couples.  After all it was V Day. The establishment itself could use more organization and a complete cleaning.  The first thing you smell when you walk into the bar is bleach.  I hate that.  Makes me think they are hiding a funky odor.   Neither of us used the restaurant restroom so I'm not sure of its cleanliness. I would visit this location again when I'm in the mood for my sizzling chicken and shrimp.  It's in my neighborhood.  The service isn't that bad whereas I would drive long distance to go to another Friday's.

AC in waiting area.  Group after us got same treatment and left.  We should have too.  Took forever to get water.   The crazy part is this is the weekend of the canton cup. The biggest soccer tournament in Michigan. They have it every year so they should be looking forward to it as a business for a busy busy weekend. Instead this place had more than half the restaurant shut off from service at all in the part that was open got very slow and unprofessional service. The young man who was the host had to explain and or argue with several groups of patrons that came in about the seating arrangements or lack there of. Before I left I told our waitress who was nice but not exactly great that they should be trying to see is many people the way the people wanted to be seated as they could. I mean if I own the place I would be wanting to get as much of the money as I could instead of turning people off.  The food we got was pretty good. Then just to burn the point into our brains a group came in as we were leaving and they were going to be seated at three random tables. The woman pointed out that the front room had tables and they could have three together. The staff again refused to see them and started arguing. It was kind of comical because it was so stupid on the part of the Friday staff to argue with potential customers who want to pay them money.  My guess is this location won't be in business very much longer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton?start=20,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

Our server, Jess showed up right away. Very friendly and outgoing. She explained the promo rules and took our order. All together we tried the deep fried green beans, the potato skins, the BBQ chicken flatbread pizza, and the pot stickers. All were good. Not great just good. The pot stickers were the best of the bunch. Not too bad for 10 bucks a person. I wish they had a few more choices of apps. But the biggest issue, and the reason this is a 2 star review, started about 20 minutes into our meal. A couple on the other side of the dining room had a small child with them and the child started to cry out quite loudly. THIS WENT ON FOR OVER 20 MINUTES. As you can imagine the other patrons are all looking over at them and wondering why one of the parents did not take the child outside. This is completely the parents fault. I can distinctly remember multiple occasions of leaving a just delivered meal because one of my youngsters was throwing a fit.

16,I G.,"Holland, MI",0,5,,1.0,2017-07-13,"It was the first time that I left TGIF sad and still hungry.  Old, crusty menus, slow service.  Both my husband and I had the ribs, with fries and coleslaw... it was more like fries with a side of bones with little meat on them... the salad had no flavor... it used to be my favorite place...  so so sad..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
12,Patrick D.,"Westland, MI",0,21,2.0,1.0,2017-08-11,"Well, I think I am done going here. I enjoy the endless apps and they are pretty good. Well, apparently their success means they shouldn't be around anymore.  Tgif employs a great new strategy to make people not go anymore. First, shrink the portions down to below child-size. Next, make you wait *forever* for your next refill. After that, make it so cold in the restaurant that you don't wait for those refills. Finally, charge $2 more for all of these great features. Add in a snotty waiter who barely comes around to get plates and refill drinks and you have TGIF in a half full restaurant on a Friday night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
9,Olivia Z.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",348,5,,1.0,2017-08-15,"If you have four hours to kill this is a great restaurant to go to for dinner. The food is OK. We had a long wait from the start. Bring a sweatshirt because it's really cold here too. There's also plenty of really big butt cracks to look at while you eat. What a great sight. I don't want to totally blame our waiter, I know how it is in the restaurant industry. However, the manager should've been around doing a lot more damage control then I saw her doing. On the plus side, the takeout containers are microwavable and dishwasher safe. All in all, I would not recommend this restaurant to my friends... I would however recommend this place to all people I don't like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
1,Nina M.,"Detroit, MI",315,428,244.0,1.0,2017-09-24,"After several dine in visits and a couple of carry outs I can say that the service has become inconsistent whether busy or not.  Bartenders: there are 2 regular bartenders that are very attentive. A young lady and a guy named Rob. Anybody else and it's hit or miss.  Dine-in: servers have always been attentive when I have dined in regularly with family.  Carry out/online: check you order throughly before leaving. Neither of the 2 orders I've placed were accurate and I don't understand how it's possible to mess a standard sandwich with deletions and a change of cheese.  Still better than Dearborn or Southfield, but stellar. I'd still come to this location to have a cocktail in the bar area. However, after mindlessly not checking my online order, getting home to is being wrong and having to make a drive back I'm not impressed with the back of the house. Only reason I would dine here would be to use the remainder of my points that I have for free food. Friday's across Metro Detroit are becoming sub-par:(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
