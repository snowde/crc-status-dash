5,Amy L.,"Newport, United Kingdom",18,15,10.0,3.0,2013-08-25,"It was busy despite being a Thursday evening in August - when there should be many less students about. (Cardiff is a notorious student town.) It took us about 20-25 minutes to be seated but we browsed the other restaurants in St David's while we waited.  Our server was friendly and we didn't have to wait long for our order to be taken (which she committed to memory) and for food and drinks to arrive.   I got a Holiday isle smoothie which was delicious and my friend had the Raspberry Crush smoothie - refreshingly tart. The rest of the drinks menu sounded enticing too, but I wasn't up for anything alcoholic today.  My main course was the 8oz New York strip steak with bourbon peppercorn sauce, which was served on the side. It came with a choice of two sides, so I got the cheese mash filled potato skins (they give you two pieces) and wedge salad. I also received a surprise serving of fries (I'm guessing perhaps the waitress mixed up my order of the potato skins as they were missing at first - but they quickly fixed this). The wedge salad was....bizzare. It was literally a chunk of iceberg lettuce drizzled with a slightly overpowering blue cheese sauce sprinkled with grilled bacon bits. The most difficult thing about it was taking it apart in order to eat it! Messy business.   The potato skins were better. The cheese wasn't melty like I expected, rather in a cooled melted lump in top of the skins but the texture and taste were still alright. The steak reminded me of why I am usually wary of ordering steak. I got it medium, but it was still too tough and chewy for me and the taste wasn't really there.  As the peppercorn sauce was so thick it didn't spread particularly well on the steak. The fries were so-so. I ended up spending £15 on something I'd rather not eat again. Overall: good drinks, decent service, good ambience (beware of birthdays though - if you want to come here for a birthday take note that there are probably 3 other parties here for the same reason, and yes, you will have to sit through the birthday sing-song 3 more times.) Would i come back?  It wouldn't be the  food that bright me back here. Rather than the high price for 'meh' food, I'd come here for casual drinks at the popular bar area. However if I had to come here for dinner, next time I would get the ribs with the Jack Daniel's sauce instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cardiff,,,,,
2,Stacey F.,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",188,41,78.0,4.0,2015-03-17,"It's a given that most would have already visited TGI Friday's - sat at their stripy tables and spilled Jack Daniels Sauce down themselves. Yet let me share a beefy secret with you... *whispers*  On your next visit tell the waitress - 'You'll have what Jack's having!'  *A burger from the TGI Friday's secret menu.  I won't spoil the surprise as to what it tastes like, or what it contains.  Just know it was delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cardiff,,,,,
3,Gareth M.,"Torpoint, United Kingdom",1,4,3.0,5.0,2015-04-08,You can't go wrong with TGI'S.  We love the place. Service is always friendly and cocktails are amazing. Food is great for snacks or meal. Kids love it too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cardiff,,,,,
0,Clarissa Y.,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",951,806,992.0,4.0,2016-12-03,"Funnily enough, even though I live in the heart of Cardiff I haven't actually been inside the restaurant. Instead, we ordered takeaway with Deliveroo so I can only rate the food! I've been to other TGI Friday's in the chain and when this restaurant was suggested as an option, I'll have to admit I was skeptical as I've not had good experiences with this chain. However, when the food arrived I was VERY pleasantly surprised! Everything was delicious! -- Times Square Big Share -- Jack Daniel's chicken wings, loaded bacon potato skins, and mozzarella dippers. The best thing about this platter were the chicken wings! Well cooked and extremely delicious. -- Cajun Cream Pasta w/ Shrimp -- Really enjoyed this! Great flavours and HUGE portions as well. I've tried bits of other people's food and everything seemed enjoyable (especially love the sweet potato fries, I will most definitely be getting those next time!). At the end of it, we were thoroughly enjoyed our meals and plenty of leftovers in the fridge for tomorrow. --- I can't speak for the actual restaurant itself, but from our Deliveroo experience, maybe TGI Friday's wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cardiff,,,,,
1,Bob S.,"Wilsonville, OR",0,4,,1.0,2017-08-07,"Monday night, pre-reserved table. Painfully slow ""service"" - hour and 20 minutes before appetizers arrived. It was an age before our orders were taken - so long that we started to wonder if our waitress had gone home. Other diners had been sat, eaten, paid and left before we'd even received appetizers :/ Appetizers were good - the Tennessee meat sharer in my case. 2 hours in.. my main course was quite possibly the poorest excuse for an alfredo that I've ever had the misfortune to eat. Bacon & mushroom, with no mushrooms, no cream sauce and barely any cheese. Basically just a bland bowl of pasta sat in it's own water with some bacon bits. Dire. If you like an alfredo then go buy it somewhere else.. anywhere else in fact, out of a jar would have tasted better. All the dinners that had veg came with raw squash that had maybe seen the inside of an oven for a few minutes. We eat at TGI Fridays often in the States - this UK version is way off the mark.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cardiff,,,,,
