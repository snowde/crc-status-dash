214,Samantha R.,"Oceanside, CA",83,61,12.0,1.0,2012-01-30,"We've come to this location twice in the last month because we received a gift card. Both times we had a bad experience. The first time the server took about 20 minutes to realize we were there, finally the manager came by and took our drink order. After a long wait we ordered and waited an even longer time to receive our meals. My meal was wrong so I had to send it back. My fiance was basically done with his meal by the time mine came. The manager gave me my meal for free and was very apologetic.  Our second visit, today for dinner, went at the same slow pace. We were seated right away, typical for a Monday night, but our waiter was very slow in taking down our drink order. There were three other parties seated around us, two of the parties had to flag someone down to ask for a server. I overheard the server two of the parties they were out of something, and we were told as well they were out of an appetizer. Luckily we were in no hurry for both occasions so the slow service wasn't too big of an inconvenience to us. What topped our disappointing visit was that we gave our waiter our gift card and enough cash to cover the rest of the bill that we owed. He took about 10 minutes to run our gift card and process our payment, so we thought he was doing. He handed us the bill back along with the gift card and cash and thanked us for coming. Not sure if he got us confused with another table, or didn't even run the card. This server should be thankful that my fiance and I are honest people. I could easily see someone taking the cash and gift card back and just walking out.  The way I see it with this location is that they either need to hire new people with experience or do a lot more training. The lack of experience at this location is giving them a bad name.  Definitely won't be returning to this location any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3?start=180,2.4,2.4,2.4,2.084,2.4

Before i get to the bad parts, the caesar salad was good and they have the most amazing breadsticks! The part that wasn't great was the chicken bruschetta pasta, which looked amazing. The pasta came out about cold and and it was not anywhere close to amazing. Definitely a let down. The service was also a little slow. Cheap menu but not worth it. Not this location..I also would like to point out that when we couldn't find the drink menu the waitress didn't know where it was, so she named a few beers they had but forgot the rest on the menu. When we did receive our drinks she accidentally spilled the water on my menu/table. not cool! -_- (Now i am editing my review after i just finished.) Turns out i had just got a call from my boyfriend who paid for our dinner last night. TGIF charged $260.00 on his card for this $26.00 meal. Looks like now i definitely will not be coming back here. Really poor service for a place that wasn't even busy. These waiters need to pay attention to these kind of things..

Our server only came around periodically and on several occasions we had to flag her down to get some service and this was before the dinner crowd showed up. For being a night of Monday Night Football, the crowd did not seem any larger than a typical week night crowd, yet the staff seemed unprepared. The only reason I'm giving this 1 star was the food was at least decent. We've been to several TGI Fridays before and have enjoyed the food and service but this one is clearly below the mark.

Minutes later, our son's dinner came out (as we requested) and then our meals came out not too long after.

194,Elena M.,"Escondido, CA",0,9,,1.0,2012-10-24,"I hate to do this review, but it needs to be done. I had made reservations for 12 for my husbands surprise b-day party.  Everyone got there before my husband and I.  I checked in and told them I had reservations for a surprise party (which I told them on the phone) the host pointed me to the back and said everyone is back there.  I had to whisper to her and ask her if she can seat us because my husband doesn't know.  So she did. I knew this was the beginning of a horrible night with bad service, and I was right.  Food was forgotten and never brought out, drinks were not filled.  My nephew is 3 and he never got his food,.  We asked for it and it finally came out while we were eating desert... after we had canceled the order with the waitress.  The server didn't know it was my husband's birthday so I had to ask them to sing happy birthday to him.  All of this was discussed when I made reservations.   We had the bill split up from the beginning and when we got the bill there were items that were on the wrong ticket.  I then gave the waitress my rewards number so I can get the points put onto my card.  I checked my rewards a few days later and the points were never added.  At the end of our visit I complained to the manager.  He was very apologetic and said the waitress is in college.  I'm a mother, I work full time and I go to school.  This is not an excuse to give horrible customer service at work.  I didn't buy that excuse.  So the manager gave us a discount.. which I already had a coupon for a discount, and gave me some coupons to come back. I called a few days later after I noticed I didn't get my rewards.  I got the run around and the manager Paublo never called me back.  I gave up.  T.G.I Fridays has lost my business.   My husbands birthday was a disaster and he did not have as great of a time as he would have liked with his family there.  I was so embarrassed in front of his family since I am the one that planned this surprise party.

I adore the TGIF franchise; having been a patron ever since I can remember, my family and I have enjoyed consistently great service at every one we've encountered. This location is a sad exception. The FK and I did come in a bit early, I must say, but apparently SO early that we could not be seated at a barside table. Fair enough. We understood and decided to sit at the bar itself. When our bartender/server was around, she was very friendly and okay on efficiency -- but I did notice a lot of extracurricular socializing with other employees. Now, I get it, I used to work in the biz and I know that opening can be a total downer. But when it comes at the expense of serving customers -- it's a huge no-no. Both the FK and I had to wait at different times to request different things, which made it even MORE awkward because we essentially were the only people in here. To make matters even worse, we saw other patrons seated at the barside tables shortly after our arrival. There wasn't even any attempt by that vapid cute little hostess to address us after the fact. Ugh. I hate that. To sum it up for you all: even a decently priced all-day happy hour (on Sundays) is not worth the grief coming in here. The entire place is suffering from complacency, riding the coattails of being a TGIF and also receiving automatic clientele from an attached hotel.

78,Jesse Q.,"Escondido, CA",23,80,7.0,1.0,2013-03-18,"Absolute worst experience! Last Saturday I go for a bike ride and afterwards I was feeling a bit hungry so made plans and girl and I head out to TGI Fridays. Have been to the place once or twice before (that location) but not had food as I was meeting friends for drinks before. Upon arriving we get greeted and give them our name for seating. As usual I prefer seating in a booth so we wait for our booth and once they are ready we walk through the bar to go grab our booth. We get dragged to the last booth right before getting to the kitchen and we are asked if that's fine; having  just passed a booth that wasn't as close to the kitchen we choose that one and step back to it and sit. We get seated and menus on the table. A couple of minutes go by and the server comes and takes our drink order, asks if we are ready for our food order, we weren't, and goes and gets our drinks. Could notice this server was in training but no big deal, you expect the same service anyway. We get our drinks and we order our food, they have a 2 for $20 deal so we order though that: - Cheeseburger (medium rare) with sweet potato fries, no onions (upcharge of $1.79 for sweet potatoes without being told about it) - Chicken pasta - Spinach Florentine Flatbread Server advises us we get another appetizer through this promo so we order the second appetizer, Mozzarella sticks. After we order we wait for our food now. I had ordered a diet coke with no ice, and I received my diet coke with ice...no surprise there. The beverage was also not sufficiently carbonated which I assume it's a matter of bad/old equipment. The restaurant is in an old building so it makes sense. After a few minutes I see the server come by and notices there's nothing on the table yet, does not say anything just walks back. Forgot to put the order in? Yup! We get the appetizers in two rounds, first the mozzarella sticks and later the flatbread. I assume we got the mozzarella sticks first as they take less time to prepare. A few minutes later we receive the flatbread which in my taste didn't cook properly, it was not crispy as expected, but the taste was ok. Entree time and our food arrives, a smallish burger that came frozen no doubt and the pasta with chicken that was actually tasty. The burger sat in the food warmers for a while, the lettuce was starting to cook (black color) and was warm to the touch. The burger was cooked well and the fries were a pittance! I did not complain at all as I imagined it was ordered as part of a ""value menu"" as well as not knowing about the upcharge on the fries. Everything went well, during dinner, food was not worth writing home about but it was within expectations. Nothing to report during dinner other than my cup of diet coke kept getting more ice with every refill. But then came the check... The check came to be much higher than I expected to begin with and that's when I started getting annoyed... Take 1: Call the server (trainer) who gave us the check and told him about the mistake, every entree and appetizer was put on as a ""regular"" not as a ""Promo."" He promptly takes the check and comes back about 10 minutes later with the revised check. Take 2: The revised check comes but charges for the second appetizer...I call the server (trainer) again and he explains that only one appetizer is included. I replied that only one appetizer was ordered until we were told that another appetizer was included. Goes back and another 10 minutes go by for the revised check. Finally get the last check with a comped appetizer (regardless at $7.99 for the mozzarella sticks, it's highway robbery!) and I square it off! Got to thinking after I left the restaurant that there were no potatoes in my plate but...too late. The server was in training but that should not have made a difference. At that point we check the yelp reviews and...no wonder! In short: Value in food was bad. Quality of service was bad, ambiance was also mediocre (kept hearing the kitchen all night).

It took more than 1 hour to get our food after ordering it...REALLY?!? ...for 6 people at 10pm when the place had 3 other people in it? 5. 4 of their staff were outside on patio smoking almost the entire time we were there...no wonder our food took so long--no one works there.  6. They served everyone their dinner except one person because ""it wasn't ready yet""....who serves a meal to guests separately? Ramsey would be pissed! By the time we were done eating, the last meal came out of the kitchen.  7. The waitress kept forgetting our orders and had to ask multiple times what we ordered.  8. I'm pretty sure the waitress was stoned...I'm not against that IF she could do her job while stoned because in that event its none of my business...but DANG lady you spilled water on me, forgot our orders, forgot that there was food to be served an hour later, and then forgot to bring us our check after we asked for it twice.

I've come here a few times since I live in Carlsbad but this last time was the last time.  I knew it was going to be rough when we sat down on a completely wet booth seat.   Clearly they wiped it down but it was soaking wet.  We only had one set of utensils.  I had to steal some from another table. We decided to go balls-to-the-wall and order steak, lobster, ribs, pizza, and a burger for our family of four.  The food (at over $20 each for the steak/lobster/ribs) was over-cooked, bland and tiny.  I could barely scrape any meat from the lobster tail.  The rib-eye I ordered was puny and tasteless.  I could get a one-pounder at Stater Bros. for $4.99 and cook it myself in half the time it took for the food to come out.  I don't get it.   The drinks were over $8 each and lacked much alcohol.  I would have even taken  the rubbing alcohol version we've heard about in the news if given the choice but no such luck.

We all ordered something different.  1 item from the children's menu...I'll start with that.  My son actually asked ""how big is the burger?""  He was VERY hungry and would have ordered off the adult menu if the waitress didn't assure him that the childrens cheese burgers were ""HUGE"" and it would fill him up.  He is small for his size and age (11) but I told her he has a larger appetite than he looks.  Again, she assured us the burger would be enough.  It wasn't even close.  It was plain and she rolled her eyes when he asked for ketchup...ayfkm?  He cleaned his plate and ate most of my veggies...and we will wrap back to those in a moment.   My husband ordered a Reuben sandwich...now there are 3 - arguably 5- things that make a Reuben a Reuben.  Corned beef, thousand island and sauerkraut -rye bread and provolone cheese..but whatever.  His came out with zero sauerkraut....but a TON of grilled onions.  Not that big of a deal...but he WANTED the kraut.  So he asked for some on the side.  10 freaking minuets later they let us know that they were completely OUT.  He was pissed.  So he sent it back.  The manager came over and said the kitchen was upset that he didn't like it but that he had started to eat it.  (he took 2 bites)..how many freaking people inspect to make sure their order is correct?  Yeah, that is dumb.   At this point the rest of the food had finally come out...yeah, it came out one plate at a time.   He ordered an app and said he wasn't happy with the Reuben and wouldn't be paying for it.   My father in law's pasta was cold...and not just sitting on the side waiting to come out cold...like freaking frozen in the middle COLD.  My mother in laws steak was over cooked so she sent it back...they cooked it through...she just ate it.  My older sons ribs were UNDER cooked and we sent those back.  I am just going to skip my salmon...but you get the idea.   The manager convinced us to order cheesecake.  I asked how big they were...here we go again...I'd prefer for the children to share.  But she insisted the slices were tiny...so they both got their own...they are HUGE.  ha of course.  I did have a bite as well as my husband and the cheesecake was very good...the only thing that was.     NOW for the check...they had the wine they were out of on there...claiming I had a glass.  HAHAHHA no - I didn't...I had water, not wine.  The Reuben was on there as well as the app and cheese cake...nothing was comped.  All the problems we had and sending so much back and they didn't even comp us the cheesecake the manager said we would.....My husband now was LIVID...and still hungry.  The manager came over and took the check.  We had to negotiate the damned check.  wine (that they were OUT OF !!!) should come off, Reuben OFF, and at least 1 cheesecake.  She wasn't happy but she ended taking all that off and my husbands app.  Well, thanks.  At this point that little gesture is meaningless.   We couldn't get home soon enough...guess what now...that app, the only thing my husband actually ate...came right back up.  We had to pull over 3 times for him to vomit.  Awesome.   Stay away from this place...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3?start=60,2.08,2.39,2.39,1.6360000000000001,2.2660000000000005

They came up quickly and tasted great as always. I ordered a pasta dish and the hubs orders a shrimp and chicken. Both were fantastic. Over all we had a great experience.

No place can be that bad.  Well, I am reporting that they were all wrong! This place is even worse than everybody says!  It started by not even being able to find the restaurant.  It is buried on the side of a hotel and there is no sign outside to indicate the entrance to the restaurant. It is crazy. Once inside, we waiting for about 10 minutes for someone to come over to the check-in desk. The restaurant was almost empty, but the two servers they had were running in circles.  When someone came over they asked if they could take my name. I asked why they needed to take my name when nobody was there and there were tons of open tables. They said ""we needed to wait for a table.""  It was very strange, but we finally got seated. Once we sat down we waited another 10 minutes to get menus and then another 10 minutes to even get a glass of water.  We went for the ""endless appetizers"" and one kids meal. It took 45 minutes for the food to come out. When we asked for another round of apps, it took another 30 minutes to get them.  After being there for more than an hour and half, we had received two rounds of appetizers. One of the apps we ordered were the Ahi Tuna Crisps. They put three on the plate and each is the size of a tortilla chip, so we ate these pretty quickly, but we couldn't wait another 30 minutes to get three more crisps.   We has also ordered the potato skins, but these tasted sour so we wanted to send them back.  The waitress said we ""weren't allowed to swap out the appetizer."" We said that we didn't like it and it was bad. After some back and forth, she allowed us to get something else. The waitress told us that they other server was taking the food that was meant for our table, so she had to put our orders back in. The place was empty!  This made no sense at all. I am not sure how Friday's corporate office can let this location stay open. It is a joke and makes us never want to go to another Fridays.  We were told that they would take one app and the kids meal off the bill. When the bill came we were still charged for the two apps. They said they took off the potato skins that we didn't eat.  I pushed back and they finally adjusted the check. If you are in the area, PLEASE avoid this place.

We saw the great happy hour deals online and said, lezzz gooo.  Soo I really don't feel like writing a long review, but to sum it up, we went in, tried to get a $4 domestic beer and wanted to split the appetizer sampler (both on special menu). It turned out that, even though on the menu it saids the beer is made in Colorado, that it was not technically domestic, and that I choose one of the appetizer that wasn't on the special. So at the point I realized these specials weren't very special. It seemed like you were paying so much just for the environment, so I looked on yelp for somewhere else and found this gem tip top meats.  Tip top meats is right across the street and is one of the best places I've been to. Its an underrated hole in the wall with cheap beer, and huge serving of German meats and sides for under $10. I got roast beef cooked in pork with a salad, French fries, potato salad, a dinner roll and a third of a pitcher of beer for about $13. It was so much I couldn't finish and that's not like me at all. And my god was the meat so so good. Ahh it was amazing. I got the Holsteiner Schnitzel and let's just say it was soo good I decided to write my first yelp review.

With that being said I want to explain my one star review.  Honestly, if zero stars was an option I would have easily given them zero. My date and I ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer, petite sirloin (medium rare) as his and Jack Daniels chicken as mine. We were there over 45 minutes, and only saw our waitress once (who didn't tell us her name), before we got our food. Which 45 minutes for the main course is fine but we never received our chips and salsa or silverware. His ""medium rare"" sirloin came and he poked it and it started gushing blood. Don't know why he poked it but he did. He had his food for maybe a minute and the waitress was already out of sight so he eats his side's, which were ok. Waitress finally comes back and he shows her that the food is not medium rare and asks for it to be cooked longer. Comes back 10 minutes later and it is solid brown. Also not medium rare... Chips were stale. Salsa was fine.  My chicken was dry but my salad and potatoes were fine. Side note: the couple beside us ordered endless appetizers as her meal and he ordered a salad and a Jack Daniels burger. She (same waitress) brings out his burger and he told her to take the salad off the bill since he never received it.  Another side note: there was a blonde (long hair pulled back in a pony tail with curl to it), skinny waitress working the same section we were in (sadly not our waitress) who was working her butt off, making sure her customers were happy and attended to.

Personally being a gay married couple I felt discriminated and judged as the other workers just looked at us. My fiancé and I sat at the red stools at the bar. The bartender was not welcoming no hello or welcome to Friday's. He said ""what do you want to drink"" I ordered a beer and my husband a dr. Pepper which he didn't get until the middle of our order when the food came out. Were ordered 2 traditional wings which we only got one because the bartender didn't put it in correctly and no apologies. As I told him about that he rolled his eyes. Our pretzels were extremely salty, we had to scrape it all off. Overall it was a complete disaster of a restaurant visit!

The server we had was new and it showed. Although she was incredibly sweet, she was slow and inattentive. She passed our table several times without asking if everything was ok or even to ask if we needed refills on our drinks. It took over 30 minutes just to get our appetizers and we were there for the unlimited appetizer deal they have going on. When were finishing our last appetizer I found a strawberry in our flatbread bbq pizza which DID NOT include strawberries at all. My sister is highly allergic to strawberries. Nothing we ordered contained strawberries nor should it have been around anything that contained strawberries. We went to the manager immediately and told him what was going on and he proceeded to tell us that we should have informed our server of any food allergies. We didn't think to notify them because after all we ordered wings and pizza, none of which contain strawberries. He then told us that it was our fault. After going back and forth with him for a few minutes he agreed to give us discount. The discount was not our intention at all. After we received our final receipt we noticed that he had only taken off our drinks. A whole $5 worth. He was rude and and completely unapologetic. He told us that it was our fault for not informing our server and that all of the same utensils and knives are used to prepare ALL the dishes. Needless to say we will never be back to this location.

The app selection is mozzarella sticks, potstickers, flatbread chicken, loaded baked potato skins and boneless wings and that's it. You can only order one app at a time.

I asked what she meant by that.....again she had to go ask. So I asked when I could order the $3 shots. She asked me to show here where I saw that price.

7,Dimples C.,"Carlsbad, CA",2,18,25.0,2.0,2015-10-02,"I've been here weekends, weeknights, lunch, dinner, happy hour, etc... you name it. Service has always been crappy! They take forever to send a waiter to greet you and even longer to bring your drinks and food out. Even when the restaurant is empty service is horrible! I can think of one time I got a great waitress. Food is bland and almost always over cooked. No flavor and burnt equals no fun! Happy hour drinks barely have any alcohol and too much ice! What the hell?! After a few being sent back, I got tired of telling them what was wrong. Tables are dirty, sticky and so are the seats. I always feel I have to clean them myself before I sit down.  Why do I keep coming back you ask? The Jack Daniels sauce! Thus the 2 stars. This is the only restaurant that I know serves it and I love it! LOL This used to be my happy hour spot with the girls since we love our JD's sauce but after giving them PLENTY of chances to improve, we're moving on. For the price of their food and drinks there are plenty of other restaurants that have better quality food and great service.  Btw, since my last visit there's a new manager and let's just say she's something that rhymes with ""witch!"" I can see why her employees don't seem to care about customer service. Bye bye favorite dipping sauce!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3,1.76,1.74,1.74,,1.7480000000000002

87,Lorri S.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,4,,1.0,2015-11-22,"I completely agree with Veronica C!  I keep coming back after crappy service. Evertime I have a horrible experience there and I come back months later because unbelievably they have some good food.  There are always many open tables, 4-5 hostesses (with unwelcoming personalities) who tell you 20 min wait for a table. Tonight we decided to wait because we thought it couldn't be that long as the place was empty.  We watch 5 separate parties walk away after being told it would be a 20-30 min wait.  The food is good. The problem has always clearly been the management. Not scheduling enough employees, too many hostesses doing nothing. It never changes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3?start=80,1.88,1.78,1.78,,1.82
29,Chevonne S.,"Escondido, CA",0,5,,1.0,2015-11-29,"Trust these reviews. My husband and I used to love going to TGIF for the food.  The service- poor. Everytime we walk through the door we wonder is the Host going smile or greet us this time? Usually they stare at us until we tell them there are two people standing in front of you that would like a table. We always feel awkward until we are seated.  Servers -average. With the exception of Dana. He is awesome. Very friendly and clearly a hard worker.  Just some advice for tgif carlsbad. You are getting paid to give great service. Just smile, greet and thank your customers and I'm sure you wouldn't only have 2 stars on YELP.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3?start=20,1.88,1.77,1.77,,1.814
11,Andrea M.,"Orange, CA",322,1,,1.0,2015-12-04,Worst experience ever! Came in at 11pm with 6 teenagers. Hardly anyone there. Ordered sides. Was told it would be 35 minutes...then 45 minutes...maybe more.  Restaurant was hard to find. Service was ridiculous. Left. Got food elsewhere in under ten minutes. And the In and Out was far cleaner! Avoid at all costs! If I could give this no star I would!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3,1.84,1.77,1.77,,1.7980000000000003
46,Vanessa A.,"San Francisco, CA",92,3,1.0,1.0,2015-12-09,We walk in in the restaurant is empty thought we would get good service since there wasn't any customers wrong sat for about ten minutes until a bartender acknowledged us and dropped off two menus or should I say threw two menus at our table and walked away didn't even greet us or anything. Five minutes later comes back and says what you want to drink I am like are u serious not even a welcome or anything. Stood up and said with that attitude we don't want anything to drink have a good night and walked out. Seriously if you don't like your job just quit please.

34,Lance N.,"Cary, IL",2,7,,1.0,2015-12-28,"We walked in, three parties before us waiting for tables. 20-30 min wait. I looked and the place was empty, big location but must have been short staffed. Employees were not outgoing at all. Food was ok. I got the French dip. Au jus was only half full, my daughters kids meal had more fries than I did. We saw at least six servers. So I'm not sure how short staffed they were. On good experiences I've had at other restaurants managers always came around to check on table, no manager came around. Server was pretty friendly. Mother in law said barrel chicken was too peppery and they did offer a substitute. Bathrooms were a disaster too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3?start=20,1.8,1.74,1.74,,1.7640000000000002
31,Hunter W.,"Gaithersburg, MD",0,9,1.0,1.0,2016-01-02,So I walked into the restaurant and the first thing I saw was 2 cockroaches reproducing in a baby chair. Then I saw a server picking his nose and flick it. I think that's what's drawing these horny insects. Finally I go to use the powder room and there was a turd in the urinal. Kinda gross. But at least our server was nice and helpful,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3?start=20,1.76,1.74,1.74,,1.7480000000000002

Typical Friday's menu, steak was great. I never order anything without the delicious JackDaniels sauce.  This is located in the Carlsbad by the Sea Resort. If the atmosphere in the hotel is anything like this restaurant, I wouldn't recommend that either.  On a Friday night this place was a ghost town. No hostess, and the employees were just there to get by. No smiles, hardly any music. It was all just bland and depressing.  They either need to relocate or remodel.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002
