Settled on the  Dragonfire Salmon, VERY GOOD, a hint of spicyness yet sweet. Cooked well done( just how I like my fish) and flavorful.

23,Lisa L.,"Midlothian, TX",91,20,,5.0,2013-12-22,"First I have to say that I normally don't like going to chain restaurants, but this Friday's location is a place I will always choose over ANY chain restaurant. The Cedar Hill location has got to be the best Friday's I've ever been to. The service has always been top notch. The servers are always polite, courteous, friendly and knowledgeable. I ordered the sirloin steak with the tomato mozz. salad and mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked perfectly. This was the second time I ordered this steak and both times it was cooked perfectly. The medium was a medium not a medium well, or a well done. The seasoning was delicious. I thought the first time was just a fluke, but the second time I ordered the steak and it tasted the way it did, I knew the chef had some talent. I'm not sure if all Friday's are like this one, but if you're in the area, stop in and have a steak! Also, the flatbread appetizer was absolutely delicious! The only downfall was that we sat in the bar and they allow smoking. So, if you smoke then this is a plus.

45,Daniel F.,"Dallas, TX",23,87,36.0,3.0,2014-02-22,I been going to this location for a few years every 3 months. The staff is courteous and attentive. I don't ever go to the bar so I can't compliment on that part of the restaurant. But I've ordered steak most of the time they cook pretty good(medium well). I get the flat iron cut and friend shrimp which is cooked fresh. I love the batter they use. In like the mash potatoes which has cheese in them. Some times the staff can get busy and forget the drinks are low. I love the red bull strawberry slush! But as far quality of the food it's good. My last visit I had a bacon burger which was very juicy and cooked perfectly.

My husband and I both ordered burgers well done. Mine was delivered to the table with bacon (we don't eat pork) and my husband's burger was bleeding in the center. Both burgers were sent back. The second time they were brought to the table, my bun was rock hard and I was missing the crispy onion strips and Jack Daniels mayo. My husband's burger was missing the sliced jalapeños and the fried jalapeño slices. We immediately asked for our check for the drinks and appetizer, paid, and left.

39,N D.,"Mansfield, TX",2,126,,5.0,2015-01-01,Been a while since I was in a TGIF and remember why now.  I'm giving this place a 5 star rating only because of Philechi - our waitress who was absolutely amazing.  We visited TGIF on New Years Eve at about 7pm and the place was midway busy.  Philechi had such a super attitude and very attentive to our table.  Even thought the food was about a 2 or 3 - Wes till walked out with a smile.   French onion soup - the best at a chain restaurant.  Jack rib-eye was really tough - vegetables had a freezer taste.  Appetizers and etc are probably what TGIF are all about.  Agree - back in the 80s TGIF was the place to go - but that's not the case in my opinion today.  These chain restaurants have changed in the last 30 years and TGIF has fallen short on making changes to keep up.    Based on the great service I got from Philechi - I would go back and give it another shot.  Could have been a bad day - kitchen short staffed due to the holiday - but in general I wish TGIF would change to keep up with its competition and make it an exciting place to be - and eat - as it was in the 80s.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cedar-hill?start=20,2.1,2.1,2.1,2.1,2.1
20,Mary-Catherine W.,"Oak Cliff, Dallas, TX",75,8,,1.0,2015-01-17,"Last night my fiancé and I sat at the bar at this location and we received awful service from everyone that we encountered while in the restaurant. The bartender, Johnny seemed uninterested and unwilling to serve us. We let him know we were celebrating my birthday, but he barely even acknowledged that we were speaking to him. He gave us a menu and never came back to take the order, and another person, Kendra I believe finally took our order after having to flag her down. The food took forever to come out, but clearly had been sitting in the kitchen waiting for someone to deliver it. We order a sizzling skillet entree and it was definitely not  sizzling, and the cheese was stuck to the skillet. We waited for at least 20 minutes for a second drink, and the only reason we even got those was because we flagged down Johnny who passed us multiple times and seemed like he was purposely avoiding eye contact. My fiancé also tried politely to get another employees attention, and she obviously heard him, but ignored him and walked away. When we did get the drinks the bartender called last call almost as soon as he placed them in front of us and was complaining about how ready he was to go home. I chose to spend the first moments of my birthday here and the entire experience was bad from beginning to end, and I will make a point to never go to this location again and will definitely be telling my friends and family about the terrible service I received.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cedar-hill?start=40,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003

On this visit we were seated promptly but the server had us waiting for about 10 minutes. Now, this night was super slow. The restaurant was nearly empty since we visited past 10 pm. When the server did show up he seemed discombobulated. He repeated our order of 3 items about 3 times. I still wasn't sure he was going to get it right but he did. We ordered a mudslide and a blueberry pom long island iced tea. We shared a rack of jack daniel ribs for about $21. The ribs are always so savory. You just can't go wrong if you order the ribs. It comes with fries and some slaw. I don't eat the slaw.  We asked the waiter for more napkins. He didn't return for about 10 minutes. We asked for extra jack daniel sauce and the waiter forgot about it.  The service wasn't great but the food is always on par.

This may be a bit unfair because I get the same thing every time but the food was excellent. The sizzling chicken and cheese is the best thing on the menu in my opinion by a long shot. I never get anything else. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Needless to say, the food was good lol. The service was excellent as well. The waitress we had was very attentive and kept my drink refilled, and I drink me pretty fast.  I think the best part about this restaurant is the management. We've had a couple of experiences with them and they always take care of us no matter the issue.  I would recommend to friends.  Only downfall I would mention is that I am not a fan of Friday's food selection besides the Sizzling Chicken and Cheese of course.

30,Karissa S.,"Keller, TX",183,92,220.0,2.0,2016-02-20,"My girlfriend and I LOVE going to TGI Friday's. It's one of our favorite places to go to when we want to go somewhere that we know (and when we want some really good mudslides).  However, this evening (Valentine's Day), we were very disappointed with the service that we received.  Let me start from the beginning.  H O S T E S S E S I'm not sure if all three of them were knew, or if there was a lack of communication, or what.  It seemed like they had NO idea what they were doing.  We arrived around... 7 pm to the restaurant. There was a 15 - 20 minute wait for two people.  However.. there were a few booths that were empty and ready to be sat at.  Mainly because I noticed that one specific booth stayed open the entire time that we waited to be sat.  They didn't really seat many people until the manager came out and had to start taking control of the situation and telling them where to seat all the other people that were waiting to be sat.  (even as we were being sat at a different booth, that booth stayed open) When we got taken to the table by one of the hosts, the table was still completely wet.  Like they grabbed a soaking wet towel and used that to wipe down the table. We both told the hostess the table was still soaking wet, and she muttered something under her breath as she walked away to I'm not really sure what.  She returned, again muttering under her breath, with a napkin... A napkin. ONE.  To dry a booth big enough for 4 people, that is soaking wet. My girlfriend and I looked at each other a little bit confused - but we didn't say a word.  When the hostess finished, she again muttered under her breath as she walked away.  We proceeded to dry the rest of the table with the sleeves on our sweaters since the table was... still wet. S E R V E R The server that we had, it was like it was his first night of training and they were so busy that they threw him out there to do it himself.  He was awkward, not very attentive, and just horrible customer service.   For example - I ordered the JD Chicken sandwhich. My girlfriend wanted to order a burger ( I can't remember the name of it right now...) and it said one of the things on it was ""Spicy Vegetables"".  So she asked our server what spicy vegetables were they.  He said, just the regular veggies that go on the burger - tomatoes, lettuce, etc.  So she asked him what makes them spicy then. & he had no idea what she was talking about until she showed him the menu so he could see what he was talking about.  Then the manager came out and we had to ask her, and she was able to answer her questions about the burger.  So much hassle.  Then the server that brought out our food just said what it was but didn't even give us a chance to tell her what we ordered so that we could get our plate. She gave my girlfriend my plate, and gave me my girlfriend's plate.  Then our server comes out to ask us  The only thing that is keeping me from giving this evening a 1 star is the fact that the manager they had on duty was so awesome and had great customer service skills. However hopefully they train their staff because it was horrible.  F O O D The food was good, at least that much was good. As well as my mudslide.  It was just a horrible experience, the only one who saved it was the manager.  With her genuine smile, friendliness and great customer service.

I along with a friend ended up visiting and decided to have a seat in the bar to have some drinks with our food.  So, we sat in the bar area and from the get go the table was dirty and the game on the TV was so loud I couldn't hear my friend that came with me talk.  We literally were yelling at each other to have a conversation with each other. Once the waitress came to the table, we couldn't hear her and she was even had to raise her voice to communicate with us for our drink orders.  By this time the noise was so loud the TV's were giving me a headache but we stayed anyway. After placing or order for two shaker margaritas the waitress went and put in our drink order and returned with some waters until the bartender could find time to make our drinks.  She took our order for food, so I ordered the Chicken with Spinach.  The waitress told me they had run out of spinach and if I wanted something else.  I ended up order a side of broccoli as a substitute. My friend ordered some chicken tenders with fries and some mozzarella sticks.  The waitress left once again and came back with our margarita shakers.  She proceeded to pour mind out of the shaker into my glass spilling some of my margarita on the table.  Of course no apology or offer to get another one to replace the spilled margarita.  The noise by this time was so overwhelming we had to get up and ask to be moved to the dining area.  The host was nice about it and sat us away from the bar only to be able to still hear the TV's from the bar like they were trying to make the small space a surround sound stadium.  We still toughened up and waited for our food.  Once the food was brought out my plate had a piece of chicken with the Jack Daniel's sauce, a side of cherry tomatoes in a sauce and the side of broccoli.  The chicken was mediocre at best, the tomatoes were good with the sauce and the broccoli was rubbery.  My friend's chicken tenders looked like they were straight from a frozen bag then fried.  Honestly, not appetizing at all. We were ready to call it quits by this time.  We finished up what we could and were out the door.  It's honestly been at least 8 years since I've been to a TGIF and after this experience with the food, 8 years may not been long enough.  There is one good thing I can say and that's about the waitress.  She was attentive as she could be given the circumstance; other than the accident spilling our drink she did a good job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cedar-hill?start=20,1.22,1.22,1.22,1.22,1.22

I frequent the Mesquite location so I know how the items typically taste.  Ordered the pink punk martini the waitress misunderstands me and just heard the word ""martini"" and makes a plain Martini.  Me and the person I came here with both realize we never specified the sides we wanted and waved her down to tell her. Guess what? Their entrees come with broccoli and mashed potatoes only any modification results in a $2 up charge which I've never even heard of at a Friday's.  We also asked about a half order of Mozzarella sticks we typically get off the 4-7-9 menu since it's a smaller portion. She informed us it's a bar only special and walked away.  The Jack Daniel's chicken also came pre glazed instead of the cups that allow us to do it ourselves. It also tasted spicier than normal compared to the sweeter flavor the Mesquite location had.

We finally flagged him down to ask about the salads and instead of apologizing he argued back and walked away. The manager was gracious enough to come and hear our complaints and didn't charge us for the drinks we didn't like nor the dip and apologized for the bad service. A hour later and we didn't even eat however the food miraculously shows up at the table as we're getting up to leave!

29,Lyndze M.,"Cerritos, CA",10,1,,1.0,2016-12-28,"So honestly I would give them no stars because of how bad the service was, but I need to write this review. We asked for waters all around and only 2 out of the 5 asked for another drink. When our waiter came back he only gave us 3 glasses of water. Then we kept asking for more water and had to wait still. We ordered 3 different types of salads, chips and dip, chicken tenders, pasta, and nachos. After we ordered, 3 different groups of people came in ordered and got their drinks. While we were still waiting for a glass of water and some salads, 25 minutes go by. When we finally got the chips and dip all the other 3 tables had their food, and to remind you we were here before all 3 of those groups. And hour has gone by and we still didn't have our food. That's when we confronted the waiter and asked him if there was anything wrong with our food, and why a simple salad couldn't be given to us. He stated that there is nothing wrong with your food. He didn't say sorry or I'll check if there is something wrong or I made a mistake, nothing. We were all upset and immediately went to go get the manager, we explained everything to her and she was confused herself. As soon as the manager came out the waiter comes out too... with our food. Crazy right! Thankfully the manager understood and let us walk out without paying for the one food that only one person ate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cedar-hill?start=20,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36

Me and my girlfriend went to Fridays at 2pm  when it wasn't crowded ordered a 3 item  combo and my girlfriend a black bean burger it took 34 min for the food to come which she had to end up leaving to get her daughter and come back to a cold burger secondly I don't eat pork and requested no bacon on my potato skins yet they came with bacon, it was taken back only to be scrapped off with more cheese for covering and NUKED until the skins had boils on them.  I asked the manager can I please just have some skins no bacon , they never came .

That being said, now on to my rant (LOL) -  What is going on these days with TGI Fridays?  They used to be a nice place to have happy hour & get a quick bite to eat that tasted pretty good. One of my best buds since undergrad & I  stopped off thinking we'd have a nice happy hour here.   This location has actually stopped their Full happy hour. You read it right - no More Full happy hour here :-/ This location now only offers 4 drinks (4 way too sweet cocktails) and two beers for happy hour, and that is it.   What a disappointment!  The place was deserted when we were there - yes, you could hear the crickets creaking.  This used to be a lively happy hour hang out, but since they shut down ALL happy hour food and most drink deals - understandably, no one goes anymore.   The quality of the food here is not good enough to support such a mistake in judgement.  Happy hour was the best think TGI Fridays had going.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cedar-hill,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
10,Robert L.,"Cedar Hill, TX",0,22,,1.0,2017-02-20,"Abyssmal.  Horrifying.  Made me want to burn my arms with cigarettes, and I don't even smoke.  My wife, son, and I went in for a late lunch, about 3:10 p.m. on President's Day.  By the time we COULD leave, it was 5:00.  Although a holiday, TGIF was by no means full, maybe 30-40%.  I don't know if there was not enough waitstaff (that's a management problem) and I KNOW part of it was our waiter, but... So the three of us ordered Endless Appetizers.  About 20 minutes later they came out.  Apparently its cool not to write things down but then, SURPRISE MON AMI, they got my son's order, BBQ Boneless Wings wrong and brought Buffalo instead... His wings did not arrive until 43 minutes after we ordered them.  Did I guess that?? Heck no, I TIMED it.  43 minutes.  30 minutes into that 43 minutes I made MY fatal mistake, asking for a refill on my Diet Coke.  I know, what a jerk, wanting a refill.  How dare I be thirsty! When did I get it? Would one like to hazard a guess mayhaps? SCORE... 30 minutes and 5 requests (1 to a different waiter who seemed concerned).  The fastest thing to our table... the check, you're right!!  This did, however five me PLENTY of time to see the table behind us sit covered with plates and food from when prior guests left and see the peeling huge stickers they decorate the walls with at TGIF.  Did I say anything to the manager? I couldn't, because by the time we left I was so angry I did not think I would be able to keep a civil tongue.      I promised myself LAST time I came to this particular location, it would be the last, but I gave it another shot...  If you have a sh*t ton of time to wait and don't mind never getting a refill while your order comes to you incorrectly, then THIS TGI Friday's is the place for you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cedar-hill,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12

32,Tasha G.,"Dallas, TX",0,5,,1.0,2017-02-26,"I use to be a huge fan of Fridays but they are going down hill . We waited 15 minutes after being seated for the manager to pass by and asked had we been helped . The table behind ours had been waiting almost 20 so I told him to take care of them first. There were 2 hostesses at the front and they said the waitress never showed for work but why did you sit us here knowing there was no one. We order the endless apps and you can only get 1 app at a time . They brought our food messed up our daughters order waited 15 minutes to get tenders so now her fries are cold . After 15 more minutes we had to go get someone to order more food cause the manager disappeared. He showed up 20 minutes later asking if we are ok ?? Noo . This was the worst experience and longest dinner ever . This place is slow with no sense of urgency and you can see stress all over the manager face . I gave it another try last night just for some quick drinks . While our waitress was decent it still was slow and my food was burnt ,you can tell this place is understaffed and lack of training.

31,Stephani N.,"Midlothian, TX",0,1,,1.0,2017-04-22,"We went and ate their today after my sons Baseball games. The Customer Service was terrible!! We had to wait 10 minutes to get seated and they weren't even busy. Then once we sit down our Waitress took our drink orders and we ordered some Potato Skins. I ordered a sweet tea and it took longer for mine to come out because they had to make more tea which is fine. But when she brought out my drink it was in a styrofoam cup instead of glass because she said they ran out of glasses (which isn't true because the table next to us got glass). Then when our potato skins came out they didn't bring us any plates, also we didn't have any Silverware. I asked our waitress if we could have plates and silverware, she gives us plastic forks, spoons and knifes instead of silverware. I ordered the new Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich and it was supposed to come with Mayonnaise on it and it didn't. My husband ordered the a Fish and Chips, it came out with Shrimp Cocktail sauce so my husband asked our waitress for Tarter Sauce and I asked for some Ranch. We sat there for a good 20 minutes and she never brought it out!!! I finally asked someone else if she could bring us some Tarter Sauce, and she looked very unpleased that I asked for it. we finally got some but my husband said it tasted weird! I never got my ranch. And on top of all that, we NEVER got refills. Definitely won't be going back!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cedar-hill?start=20,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002

Which I don't really understand, you can still make the food without putting the order into the system.. We still had some shopping to do and this took over an hour out of our time.

We waited 15 minutes then I went to the bar and ordered a soda, and let the bartender know we have not been served. I was very polite. Then another 10 minutes goes by. I got up to get my friend a drink, and the manager met me at the bar and apologized and said she will resolve this quickly. Another 5 minutes went by, a table of 3 sat right next to us and were greeted immediately, so we got up and left. I was so nice about it and said ""Hey its Christmas its ok "". Ridiculous manager.

1,Jun K.,"Grand Prairie, TX",0,3,,2.0,2018-01-05,"To start off, the food was great. They threw them in the boxes and didn't mess up my order but that's where it ends because the rest of this visit was whack, I had a to-go order, spent 40 minutes at the location. To start off I tried to place an online order, didn't go through, okay. Called the restaurant. Picked up on third call, cool. Girl was super nice, put in my order & told her I would be coming to pick it up around 6pm. Read my order back to me correctly, said it'll get cooking around 5:40 to be ready for pickup at 6. So 6 PM rolls around and I get there like right on time. Go into the restaurant and wait for the server to get off the phone, never got off the phone or acknowledged my existence. Some other servers got to me and said to-go is claimed at the bar. Walk back to the bar and tell her my name & order. She tells me there is no such order but I can place one now. ""It'll only be about a 10 minute wait."" I'm literally already here and I already ordered technically YEAH, so I repeat my order to her & she's like ok about 10 minutes. I sit down, wait for my order. Took at least 25 minutes, not too bad, its fine at this point. Ask for sauce for the fries because another person (who came in after me and left before me) asked for sauce and a different server named off like 10 options. When I asked the server who was attending to me she replied, ""uh, we have, like, ranch? that's all."" SO IM LIKE YEAH WHATEVER OK GIVE ME SOME RANCH PLEASE. She goes back for the ranch. Looks me in the face, gestures the ranch towards me, and tells me she'll put it in the bag. At this point I'm in a full ""lolk"" mood & I got my stuff, FINALLY, I'm done. Time to leave. Again, spent a total of 40 mintues at this location waiting for my to-go that wasn't ready or to go by the time I got there. Reached in the bag at the first stoplight just to check out the goods and it turns out she didn't even close the ranch. It's just everywhere in the bag. Now its on my hands while I'm driving home, cool. So I mean, long story short: great food, terrible service. I did carry out. If I know how bad the service is, I can't imagine dine-in but I guess its hit or miss from the rest of these reviews.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cedar-hill,1.4,1.4,1.4,,1.4
