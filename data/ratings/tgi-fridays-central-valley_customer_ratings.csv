43,Yan T.,"Manhattan, NY",2432,1659,195.0,3.0,2012-01-10,"A pretty standard TGI Friday's in the middle of a large shopping plaza not too far from Newburgh. Not the most time-efficient pitstop on a Saturday night, but it beat the 45-minute wait at Outback and Chili's.  The service was very friendly, though good intentions exceeded execution. The walls were decorated with a mix of nonsensical curios that are well familiar at this chain and its brethren. The food was pretty decent--chicken skewers with teriyaki sauce and a Kansas City BBQ burger. I washed it down with a Saranac ale, which was a nice local addition. And you can't argue with the value.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-central-valley?start=40,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284
31,Calvin S.,"Winnipeg, Canada",71,1078,1237.0,3.0,2013-10-13,"I came here holding my breath, to be honest. Originally I wanted to search for good restaurants around Woodbury, however the wifi in my hotel wasn't working. Seeing how this is the only plaza I know aside from the outlet mall itself, I decided to give it a shot. In terms of expectations, they weren't set very high. However, the first thing I noticed was the free wifi sticker. Yay, wifi! Can't argue with that. As for everything inside...meh. Our server was okay, but he seemed rather uninterested in us after he realized we were only here for a small dinner meal (our family of 4 only ordered three items).  We had the cajun shrimp and chicken pasta, the pick three-for-all, and the chicken flatbread. The flatbread and the pick 3 (boneless + fried mozzarella, potato skins) were both quite good, however the pasta was a bit on the disappointing side as the ""cajun"" was really the chef spamming black peppers on the food. It was definitely a risky decision to come here. We weren't too dissatisfied, but I'm sure with prior research there are better restaurants around the Harriman area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-central-valley?start=20,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252

I almost threw up!!! I really didn't mind paying since it's for a business trip. But it was the worst experience I've had and will never ever be back.

We were kind of far from home so we had to google search a nearby TGI to eat at. Google lead us to this restaurant which was less than 5 minutes from the Outlets. When we got there, there was no host in sight. So we looked around and waited about 5 minutes for her to finally appear which is the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5. Our waitress was so jolly, happy and smiling, you could tell she loves her job (or at least acts like it), which made me feel at ease. We both ordered pot stickers as an appetizer (it was so delicious!) and as an entrée we both got steak with fried shrimp and a half rack of BBQ ribs and broccoli. My friend asked for her steak to be well done and I asked for mine to be medium well. We both got what we asked for. I don't know if I was just a little bit too hungry but that was the best darn steak I ever had in my life lol. It was cooked perfectly and flowed with juices...very succulent. The ribs were pretty good too and so were the shrimp. I got the mango peach slush as a drink and it was free refills. The waitress let me take a full cup home with me. She was an amazing waitress, you don't find a lot of that these days. She let us eat our food in peace and didn't bother us too much with checking up on us which was nice. She came by our table probably every 15-20 minutes to see if we were ok. The AC was cranked up a little too high though but I had a jacket on. My friend was freezing even though she had a sweater on.

8,James D.,"Wappingers Falls, NY",0,1,,1.0,2017-05-28,"STAY AWAY STAY AWAY , One of the worst experience ever. My fiancee and I went here for a quick lunch and upon walking inside the host and hostess were having a full blown conversation. We were ignored until they finished their personal conversation and then seated. We sat there for a few and our waitress appeared. She had NO personality and seemed a little angry or pissed off. Never introduced herself or smiled. Just lacked enthusiasm and any sort of personality. We took two waters and when she came back my fiancee asked her what flavors they had for the wings and her response is ""it's on the next page"".....she couldn't even tell us the flavors?? Ok so we give her the appetizer order and when she returned I gave her my main order which she wrote down and walked away not even acknowledging or confirming the order back. I asked for medium and I get well done burger. The oil was all over the plate that we couldn't even pick it up to eat and had to leave the bottom bun on plate! Our non friendly waitress didn't even check on us the only thing she did was walk by snatched the cup to refill water. Once we got our check we gave what we thought was the right tip for crappy service, crappy food and lack of personality. If I was up to me I would've left nothing but a note to tell her why she was getting nothing. So as we were walking out hear comes this waitress all angry chasing after us slapping the stack of money against the check. ""Nice, very nice guys..., next time you come back ask for me"" she said angrily  so my fiancee responds back ""yeah we will  because you were very friendly right.."" hahahahaha it made my day! Liste. don't go after your customers if you rightfully get a crappy tip. Start by asking yourself what did you do wrong...if you don't know you shouldn't be in this business. I would recommend people to STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-central-valley,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0

There is literally one other table with people at it, in the whole restaurant.  We order nachos, 2 burgers and a sandwich. We have an hour for lunch.  25 minutes before the nachos hit the table.  I tell our waitress, Tatiana, that we're only on a lunch break and have to get back so, please bring out the food as soon as it's ready. Two people sit down at the table next to us 30 minutes after we arrive.  Waiting, waiting, waiting... our empty plate of nachos has been sitting there for ten minutes. Tatiana comes back and I tell her that we're out of time and to please pack up what we ordered and bring us the check. She then proceeds to bring out the food that took ten minutes to make, to the table next to us.  We STILL haven't seen our lunch. That was just beyond bullshit. Ten minutes for our neighbors but, couldn't get our burgers out in 45 minutes. She never packed up my salad and my two friends and I left pretty pissed off. We scarfed it down back at work and all had stomach aches and such from it, for the rest of the day. A bill of $56 for a whole lot of nothing and getting sick. Stellar. Never again will we go there for lunch. Obviously, the nachos and burgers, which should have taken a TOTAL of 15 minutes to prepare, in an empty restaurant,  takes almost an hour to get done... and for nothing even sub-par, but actually physically sickening. What a shit show. Terrible, absolutely beyond belief!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-central-valley,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88

We waited by the door for quite some time as we waited for the hostess to come over and greet us. Finally we sat down and the waitress took over 20 minutes to come to our table. The hostess offered to get us a drink which took almost 10 minutes to get because the bartender was on break. After the waitress finally came to our table, we ordered only a single appetizer which the kitchen messed up. In turn, we had to wait an additional 10 minutes for them to remake it leaving us with barely any time to enjoy our lunch break. We asked to speak with the manager. Sandrea came to the table and offered to comp our appetizer.

1,Lisa P.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",65,9,,1.0,2017-09-21,"Hello. I would like to formally complain about the terrible dinner we had at this location tonight. We went to celebrate our co-worker who is going to get married and this was ruined by a family that should have been kicked out. Today we ate dinner at TGIF and was APPALLED by the customer that came in and sat at a table near us. First off the customer, started berating the server, who did nothing! The customer proceeded to call our waitress 'fat, told her to get a life' and many other egregious terms. The store manager decided it was more important to appease this rude customer rather than telling them to leave. Around 6:30 PM, the customer started screaming at the server calling her a 'c*nt, a bitch' and so all of us (5 people) decided that if the manager wasn't going to make them leave, then we would leave. We did not finish our last round of drinks or the food we had because at this point we were so upset and no longer wanted to be in this environment. Also, because our server was CRYING, the service was not good. We tipped her well regardless because she was treated so horrible. You can run the cameras and see that the customer was out of control. The tables nearby had children! Ourselves and the other customers told the irate customer that she cannot use that language in front of all these people. It is a shame that the NICE customers, had to leave because it was so uncomfortable. What was supposed to be a fun evening out, turned into a terrible, anxiety ridden dinner. I hope that none of your servers are ever treated like this again. We hope that none of your customers have to PAY to eat dinner in such a hostile environment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-central-valley,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96

7,Arianna C.,"Waldorf, MD",30,25,36.0,1.0,2017-11-06,"last night around 10:30pm myself and a few coworkers decided to stop by TGI Fridays for a quick bite to eat however, we came to notice that when we walked in we were greeted by a bartender who attempted to give us menu's followed by we don't have any food. When we asked why not the bartender stated that they sent the entire kitchen staff home already two hours early, so 30 minutes prior to us arriving and it was not even last call yet. Now imagine my surprise as a former TGI Fridays Employee and current TGI Fridays regular how frustrating that is when you have a group of hungry individuals coming to a restaurant expecting to spend money and eat greeted by ""we sent the kitchen home at around 10"" which is two hours early. This is not standard Friday's Procedure, it never has been. Especially on a Sunday when you are the only restaurant people depend on because you are still open. I would definitely like to speak to management about this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-central-valley,1.64,1.64,1.64,,1.6400000000000001
