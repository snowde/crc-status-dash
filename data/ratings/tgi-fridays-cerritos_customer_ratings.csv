I wide selections of dishes here and well, the food just never seems to cut it.  I find myself here only when friends invite me out for a few drinks or for someone's birthday. If you're into the whole jack daniel's steak, ribs, & sauces type of thing then you would probably become an instant fan.  If there is one thing I love on the menu it would be the spinach artichoke dip.  It's creamy, cheesy, & salty.  YUM!

466,Megan Y.,"Irvine, CA",21,126,,2.0,2012-03-13,"I really want to give this a better rating, but I just can't. I'm always torn when I go to TGIF because I've never come across really good food. Everything is usually mediocre. Though the sizzling parmesean chicken was actually not bad at all. Our waitress was also pretty awesome for having to take care of party of ~20.  Don't order drop shots from here. I ordered a jager bomb, and they poured the jager right into the red bull before giving it to me. I don't know why  they couldn't give me two glasses to do this shot properly. I was ordering it for the birthday boy, so I had to walk it from the bar back to the table. The reason jager bombs are good is when you drink it  the moment its mixed together. Not that big of a deal, but still annoying.  So what made this rating go down so much was because they flat-out lied. I ordered an all-american mojito, which instead of rum you have bourbon. When they came around with the drinks, they were here's a mojito. No one else at the table had ordered a mojito, so I said something, but I said I ordered an all-american. He was like this is it. I was like, but I didn't order a regular mojito. Regular mojitos are a greenish color, which this one was. Now, to my knowledge bourbon is a brownish color, so shouldn't the drink have been brownish? He kept insisting this was it, and I kept questioning how could it be. He took it back, but a minute later, a different waitress brought ""my"" drink, which I swear was the same one he just took back. She was like, this is the all-american. I asked, is there bourbon in here? She was like yes. I try it, no hint of bourbon at all and bourbon is a pretty distinct taste. I was about to complain, but my friend was like, ""dont worry about it,"" to the waitress. I was a little annoyed at him. He was like, ""they're stingy about their alcohol."" I was like, I would understand if it was weak, but they got the wrong drink! I like mojitos, but if I wanted a regular one then I wouldn't be ready to raise hell about it. Two of my other friends tried it too and confirmed that there was no bourbon. So I guess here at TGIF they think bourbon is clear.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=440,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.216,3.1600000000000006

275,Chris J.,"Long Beach, CA",207,471,187.0,2.0,2012-07-13,"I gave TGIF a second chance; sadly they'll most likely not get a third. I had a stunningly incompetent service at their location in the LB Town Center (see prior review) and was comped with an $8 (yes, you read that correctly) gift certificate.  Second most convenient location was Cerritos, so it's my off day 4pm lunch. Hostess, wearing those patterned black nylons (not the ""I'm a stripper"" fishnets or ""I'm""m classy"" plain black) seated me in the second small table to the left of the hostess podium.  Server arrived (Julianna) took my drink order (iced tea).  While I was waiting, I counted six tables that hadn't been bussed; understandable if its the lunch or dinner rush, but it took the staff (which appeared to be more than adequate for mid-day) 20 minutes to clear tables.  The last one, the booth on my left, got cleared just before I received my bill. I think my server got assigned to another section, as the hostess gal came back to take my order (the Salmon Langostino).  Salmon was fine; cooked properly.  The lobster pieces (all six of them) were disappointing.  Unlike most menus you've seen at other restaurants, what you see here is definitely what you get.  Veggies were either over- or undercooked; carrots were crunchy, while the broccoli was barely holding together.  I also opted for those Parmesan fries, which the hostess told me ""there's an up charge for those"".  While I saw calorie count info for the sides, I honestly didn't see such an up charge on the menu.  You also get a whole six (that's 6) wedges, drizzled in melted butter with a dash of grated Parmesan cheese and a dusting of parsley.  It might have been the size of a small or medium potato if you reassembled it. Iced tea refill were handled by no less that four servers (Julianna, the hostess, a cute gal with red carnation in her hair and a random server); this doesn't come as any surprise as I was seated in a main thoroughfare area. The real kicker is the bill; this gets interesting.  The ticket I had just listed the Salmon Langostino with steak fries and veggies for $18.99.  The iced tea wasn't listed.  Subtotal $18.99, tax $1.66, total $20.65.  Put my card in the sleeve along with my $8 (haha, this still cracks me up) gift certificate.  Julianna comes back, with the new adjusted total of $15.79. Hmmm, let's do some math. According to the receipt I was presented, they should have removed $8 from the price of the entree, then compute tax and total...18.99 - 8.00 = 10.99 x .0875 = .96.  Total = 10.55.  The ticket I received after they returned my card was for $15.79.  So, lesse...I got online to look up their menu, but prices aren't listed.  I'm under the impression that they forgot to add my iced tea (let's call it $2 for the sake of example) ... 18.99 + 2 = 20.99 - $8 disc = 12.99 + 1.14 tax = 14.33.  Hmm, still not right.  I won't bore you with more examples, but I kept adjusting the cost of the iced tea, minus the $8 discount and figured 8.75% tax.  The closest result I came up with (without performing stupid amounts of mental gymnastics) was $15.74 (their total was $15.79...I'll deal with a nickel slippage).  This would mean my ice tea was $3.49 (accounting for standard $xx.99 pricing).   The thing that really bothers me is that they don't itemize your order; I can imagine if people did that ""2 for $20"" nonsense and the servers just ring it up like a normal order.  They also don't show you how they compute a discount; I just got a bill for $15.79 with the ubiquitous blanks for tip and total.  I gave the standard 15% ($2.37...since they got on my bad side) for a new, adjusted grand total of $18.16. Won't be back because: 1.  Lackluster service 2.  Lackluster appearance of restaurant (bus your tables!) 3.  Lackluster appearance, flavor and overpriced food 4.  Location (Long Beach to Cerritos?  No thanks) Sending feedback to their corporate office, mostly to question their billing issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=280,3.08,2.96,2.96,2.3440000000000003,3.0080000000000005

I then have to wave down my waitress to come back because she was taking forever to make sure everything was okay, which it wasn't. I then tell her I ordered the wrong thing, but ill eat it just requested some JD sauce. Knowing I'm already an unhappy customer instead of going to get the sauce first she goes to add the JD sauce to my bill!! Then goes and gets my sauce by the time she's back my food is cold! I lost my appetite and my patients being there! The cooks manager was nice. He came out to talk to me because he noticed I sent my food back and didn't even touch it.

240,Joshua K.,"Norwalk, CA",220,22,,1.0,2013-05-18,"Just for clarification, this event happened last year but I forgot that I had rated this place so highly at one point in time.  My boyfriend's cousin came to town from Mexico and she is 25. She's a pretty young college aged girl like you and me except she's from Mexico. Well, we ordered a round of drinks and the waiter checks for her I.D.; fair enough. She gives her passport to the waiter who sees that it's from Mexico and then swiftly declines her order for alcohol based on what? That they don't take passports as a form of I.D.  Let me just make a few things clear here:  1) Many tourists eat at this restaurant because there is a reputable Sheraton across the street as well as the fact that it's in a reputable plaza like the Cerritos Towne Center. I have been in TGI Fridays enough at this location (I used to go once a week) to see people from Australia, England, and other general places from Europe get carded only to see them serve a passport as I.D. and the waiters all see this as permissible.  2) There is a sign in the front of the establishment which states that they take passports as a form of I.D.  So there's something going on here. Either the manager at the time was racist or just had a completely different standard for where the passports come from...which means he's racist. I don't even know how else to explain it.  Then, when we called the manager over and pointed this out, he laughed at us and said it was okay just this once as if we were burdening him.  Then, as the night drew on, the waiter was increasingly more rude, not very adamant about serving us anymore and he messed up our order. That was the night we decided not to come back.  Let me tell you though that we were building up to that point. As management changed, so did the waiters and some of the male waiters there have made it very clear that they are not comfortable with serving a same sex couple (remember I said boyfriend at the beginning of this review?) and several of my friends have complained and not wanted to come back because certain waiters have always been colder to us than others and steadily avoided serving our table for very long. I don't really want to write a novel here, but that's basically it. We won't go back because we don't feel welcome and it seems that the management at the time (I don't know if he's still around) was very narrow minded and openly discriminated against certain people.  A disclaimer: The manager did attempt to contact me after I contacted corporate and he left a short message. I tried to get back to him once and he wasn't there (obviously he can't be there 24/7) so I just let it go. There's no point in talking to that man when we've had these problems before and don't intend on going back to hold his hand and resolve them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=260,2.52,2.93,2.93,2.244,2.766

SERVICE: Happy Hour is only available in the bar area but we had a party of 8.

My boyfriend and I ordered to go, like we've done millions of times over the past 6 years, but this time was just an absolute waste of time, money, and energy.    I ordered: Friday's three for all: sesame Jack chicken strips, loaded potato skins and the green bean fries. Boyfriend ordered a BBQ pulled pork sandwich and that's when she began to repeat my order....I mentioned the sandwich comes with a side and she said ""oh yea...."" So I just blurted out veggies to make it simple cause I could tell the three for all was still processing.  Pick up time is in 20 minutes, cool. The boyfriend leaves and a few minutes later he calls me. They told him they called me 3 times to tell me that they can't do the three for all with the options I chose, so I would have to order them all separately. I said ""WWHHAAT?! We order the same thing EVERYTIME!!! And NO ONE called me!! Not once!"" He told her that but she insisted that she couldn't do it so I said FINE order the TWO for all then!  2 minutes later I get another phone call ""Ok, I guess they CAN do it, they're gonna make your 3 for all now.""        So, he's waiting there and 10 minutes later I get a text ""Just got the food, they forgot to give us our sauces. They're getting them now."" Got the food home, the sauce they put in the box was ONE ranch and ONE wasabi ranch.....no Jack daniel's sauce for the chicken, no sour cream for the potato skins, no BBQ sauce for the sandwich.

From the start we walk in a sit at a booth in the bar, no one greets us or helps us for 10 minutes.  Then we order our drinks and food and it takes forever to get our drinks, because the waitress is too busy shopping for makeup with another customer who brought it in. Then we get our drinks and food and im served my hard cider with a glass that is cracked all the way down the side, not a crack inside but one that had very sharp edges. We told the bartender and she threw it out and we also let the manager know. By this time we had been here for two hours and had to use the restroom.

This is not a single stalled restroom.  This one had several stalls that men and women were supposed to use. I believe this is against the law. I will be reporting this to the state of california. Horrible visit from beginning to end. And just to let you guys know, many people were upset about the restroom situation.

First of all, the flatbread was soft, like someone had microwaved it. I've had these flatbreads at other TGI's, they're supposed to be crunchy! The wings were barely sauced and the potato skins weren't as good as other places.

397,Ray A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,2014-01-16,"I recently came to TGI Fridays for the first time.  I will never go back.  Upon entry, we were given the option to sit in the dining area or the bar and informed happy hour prices would be in effect in ""a few minutes,"" for the bar side only.  Thinking we were primarily spending on food, rather than drinks, I initially opted for the dining side.  However, after seeing the happy hour prices included half-off on appetizers, we asked to be switched to the bar area a few minutes later. Upon getting our bill, we noticed we had not been given any happy hour prices.  The server was very polite and apologetic, but said it was because we had initially sat in the dining area and placed the first part of our order there.  She offered to let us speak to the manager, which I accepted.  This is where I became irritated. The managed declined to oblige my request to speak with him.  He hid in back and made the server deal with us.  She returned to say he refused to honor the happy hour prices because they were placed moments before happy hour began.  The first part of the order was placed 9 mins prior to happy hour.  The second part was two minutes prior.  I had assumed when we were initially happy hour would begin in ""a few minutes,"" they would not be that strict to the minute, and if so, kindly advise us to wait a few more minutes since we had relocated specifically to get the discount. Irritated the manager didn't even have the courtesy to come speak to me, the server apologized again and asked if she should make a second request for him to come speak to us.  I declined and told her I wouldn't ever return to the restaurant.  She relayed this message to the manager and even still he blew off speaking to us.  So we were informed of their special discounts, relocated to the bar for nothing, paid full price on appetizers we thought would be discounted and never even got blown off in our request to speak to the manager.  It's these kinds of draconian business practices, focusing entirely on opting for a few extra dollars at the expense of customer satisfaction, that leads chains like this to a poor reputation.  This is my only experience with this company and it was once too many.  Truly awful (mis)management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=360,2.68,2.85,2.85,2.2760000000000002,2.782

This restaurant is supposed to give you the feeling that every day is Friday. For a split second I did.  This location is in the beautiful city of Cerritos in the huge shopping center off of Town Center by Wal-Mart. Location is great, the patio is nicely shaded by beautiful tress and the inside is pretty big.  We caught a late lunch and I have to say for close to 2PM it was pretty poppin' for a weekday. That being said we didn't have to wait which was nice. The service was top notch, not too much not ignored, ya' know what I mean. Our server recognized that we were on break and served us with no delay. Great place to come on a work lunch break. I ordered the dragonfly salmon with rice pilaf and broccoli. The fish was cooked nicely with a crispy crust just the way I like it. It was actually a very generous size and had a honey glaze and topped with a mango salsa. It was mouthwatering good. The rice was a little sog but the broccoli was great so I didn't mind at all.  Now for the item that kicked my rating from a solid 3 stars to a healthy 4.... THE ULTIMATE BROWNIE!!!!!!!! OMG, I am not a dessert person so when my coworker said ""let's share"" I told her I would pass. When the server brought it to the table and plopped down two spoons I picked one up before my friend. Picture this: Warm freshly baked Ghirardelli chocolate brownie still warm, chocolate syrup poured on top with a scoop of vanilla ice cream toped with walnuts and caramel drizzle. WTH!!! Couldn't pass it up. All in all it was a really good lunch. They have a large menu with something for everyone including dieters, Vegheads and kids. Very clean and the refills came without asking.

My potatoes were over cooked, hard, and tasted like heat lamps, my mozzarella sticks turned out to be Asiago and another mix of cheeses that were far from mozzarella, and the hot wings were under cooked and the meat was very squishy.

When I bit into one of the wings I noticed that it was undercooked  (red on the inside and chewy). I notified the bartender who was pretty cool and the wings were taken back. The new batch of wings came out but they were half buffalo half bbq. So I told the bartender that we ordered only buffalo and didn't want bbq. She apologized and said she'll have the order corrected.  I then see me new wings come out drenched in Buffalo sauce which would normally have enjoyed if not for the fact that the cook simply drenched the bbq wings in Buffalo sauce and sent them back out. Let's just say the bite I took was pretty gross.  I notified the bartender about the wings and told her I was no longer interested in new wings since I lost my appetite. The bartender immediately informed the manager who comped the wing's and gave me a coupon for a free appetizer on my next visit... I still gave the bartender a pretty good tip since she was at no fault to what the cook did and because she called the manager immediately before we told her to.

This was our first time here.  We are regulars at the long beach location!!  When the hostess sat us at the table, it was dirty. We didn't want to wait much longer so we wiped it off with our baby's baby whipes.  As soon as our server got to the tablet and greeted himself as Bryantt with a huge smile and offered us drinks. Once we got our drinks, we ordered 3 endless appetizers which took about 25 minutes to come to our table. They didn't even last 5minutes before they were finished so we waited for our server to appear to order a refill. He was no where to be found. About 10minutes later, we asked him for a refill and he said he had already ordered one, which was odd because we didn't let him know what kind of sauce we wanted for our boneless wings. So we requested a sauce. And he rushed to leave, we didnt even get to order our entrees .Our refills took another 15 minutes, and we were missing one. When he came , I had ordered a petite sirloin for here and a shrimp Friday for my husband who was being impatient because the food was taking too long. Again he rushed off, I had to call him several times, but he did not respond.we figured he might have been busy with other tables, but once we looked around it was pretty empty in the section we sat in. I wanted to let him know I wanted to change my plate for the rib trio. So I had to get up and look for him. Once I told him I let him know what I wanted he seemed a bit disturbed and annoyed. My rib trio came about 5 minutes after which was very strange because our appetizers took almost half an hour. Our shrimp Fridays to go took for ever to come out so I asked another server for the check since our's was nowhere to be found again.  Once he came with our bill, I noticed he never ordered our Friday s shrimp to go. We were so fed up with the service and the delays I didnt bother to let them know it was my husband s birthday since he was already mad that the food took forever. I was eager to speak to a manager about our situation, but my sister was also annoyed she wanted to get up and leave. I have been a server since I was 18, I am now 26 and I know this is not a way to deliver customer service.

Also,  the fact that the manager walked around with an arrogant attitude barking out orders without even caring about his surroundings or doing the unthinkable of perhaps helping his team, all while having ATLEAST 7-10 empty tables.

Anyways, my dad and I ordered the 2 for $20 (drinks not included). It's a pretty good because you do get a sufficient amount of food. You can always get more premium stuff such as steak or seafood for a surcharge of 3 or 5 dollars, but we stuck with the basic 10/10. So overall, the quality is decent. It doesn't have the home cooked fresh taste so don't come here if you're looking for that. If you are looking for a good vibed place and bar food, then this is the place. I got the ""Friday's Shrimp"" with a side of Macaroni and Cheese. It originally came with fries but you can swap it out. The best part about this entree was the Mac and Cheese, maybe because I love Mac and Cheese. The shrimp was better than I expected! It was crispy and the batter had flavor! Enough about my meal though. My dad got the ""Balsamic Chicken Caesar Salad"". It's everything that the name says. Just balsamic, chicken, and Caesar. My dad found it mediocre at best. It was just a bowl of Caesar with some chicken. The chicken had a drizzle of balsamic and was a bit dry. Before our entrees we got the friend green beans, they're pretty crispy and when you dunk it in ranch, even better. The sauce that comes with these little beans is a mix between a horseradish kick and ranch. Service is a bit slow, but that's what expected when the restraint is packed and on a Friday. The atmosphere is nice though. It can be a family type place (away from the bar) or a good hangout spot with friends.

The first I went to this location I was seated but I seated 10 mins in and please keep in mind during my lunch break there were no customers there so I did not understand why it took someone 10 mins to seat me. The waitress was nice don't get me wrong but she hardly checked up on me I was the one always having to flag her down for something and it was just slow service and I did not understand why when there wasn't really any customers during that time. The second time I went which was today 4/8/15 I figured since I was running late I decided to order my food in advance so that when I got there it would be ready and I could just eat. Tell me why when I get there I state to the gentleman who took my order that I was the person who phoned in and he stated oh yes let me go put that order in for you and I am thinking in head really bro that is why I phoned in advance so that I wouldn't have to wait long then he leaves to place my order and no one wants to seat me servers are walking by hearing me jingle my keys and I finally decided to seat myself down at the bar when I had told the waitress that I placed in a phone order and was upset that no one could sit me down she didn't even want to hear me out and went straight to the manager. Then when the other gentleman came back with my bill I noticed my bill was higher than usually when I looked at the menu I noticed he had placed in the wrong order and from there I just told the manager everything that happened she was sorry and got everything corrected right away.  The only thing that sucks is that it took almost the rest of my lunch to get my food. I had to eat really fast and couldn't really enjoy my lunch day. When asking for my bill I guess the manager felt really bad for all the inconveniences she gave me a free meal, but my thing is this place is the closet to me for a decent lunch I didn't care if I had to pay all I ask is to get my order right and have it ready when I call and get there so that way I can enjoy my lunch especially if its a slow lunch time and there really isn't any customers there should be no reason for screw ups.

We ordered the unlimited $12 appetizer, a basket of fries, and a fettuccini Alfredo, as there were only 2 pasta options on the menu. Our guy server is was pretty quiet, not really enthusiastic, gave basic short responses to questions ""yes"" ""no"", and overall didn't give us the vibe that he liked serving us. He didn't really even try to pretend. Observing the rest of the employees, most of them didn't smile at all either. What a drab looking group of people! This kind of sucked because we had great service at the long beach location recently. Overall service wise I would not return to this location again, which is a shame because Cerritos is a nice city. Food wise, the boneless buffalo wings are delicious. The only other acceptable appetizer from the $12 unlimited menu is the mozzarella sticks and the loaded potato skins (if they aren't burnt). Sadly, even though I ordered a plain fettuccini Alfredo, it was pretty lacking in flavor in both the pasta and the sauce. I didn't expect it to be extravagant, but I really do cook better pasta at home.

83,Carlos F.,"Azusa, CA",80,294,99.0,1.0,2015-05-19,"So let's start with a disclaimer: this is my first time eating at TGI Friday's, and with a party of 16, I'm sorry to say that it turned ugly much faster than I thought. First shocker was that they DO NOT have bottomless fries. $3.99 for a small plate of fries, you would think they would match the competition with the endless refills. Not the case. Next were drinks. I always start off with a water, no ice. I don't usually make a big fuss about ice being in it, but this not only had a ton of ice, it was disgusting ice to boot. I'm not sure what their ice maker looks like, but I think they should check it, and the water lines that lead to it.  And another big note: when you don't have free refills on a drink like a strawberry lemonade (competition wins again), please don't fill it to the brim with crushed ice before adding the drink, forcing you to pay $0.49 for another drink in a few minutes.  On to the food:  Mozzarella sticks were too salty, and the marinara tasted like a funky jar of Ragu sauce.  The burger that I ordered was to be medium rare (which I figured to come out as true medium), really came in as a slightly charred medium well. It went back to the kitchen. Another order had a BLT that didn't have any guacamole. ALL 5 of the smoke stacked burgers were missing the bacon. Nobody wanted to make any deal of it. I also noticed that they were to have 2 patties, but each patty looked to be about half a normal patty. I personally have a problem when restaurants do that. A steak that was ordered medium was med-well going on well. Chicken something pasta was horribly overcooked and mushy, and just on the other side of over-salted. So, aside from my no-ice mishap, everything with the service was standard.  Are all Friday's this horrible?

114,Jessica M.,"Puyallup, WA",5,39,13.0,2.0,2015-11-16,"I went here around midnight with my cousin and her boyfriend. As soon as we entered, we waited 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us, even as workers passed by us several times. Then the host finally tells us to either sit at the bar (which was full and had no open spots for us unless we wait 10 more minutes while the DJ cleans up) or sit in the dining area but expect really slow service because there's only one waitress. Great choices!  We decide to wait for the DJ because at least appetizers will be half off in the bar. She did not mention to the DJ that we were waiting so he was taking a very long time, chatting with randoms. I blame the host for that, she could have at least given him a heads up. She told us as soon as he leaves we could sit down and after all that waiting, the table was cluttered with filth. At that moment I see busser cleaning off one of the larger tables and dash towards it. Finally, a seat!  Another 10 minutes go by as we wait to order our delicious tap water and an appetizer that is clearly half the order they normally give, it's literally ""half off!"" Apparently she thinks this is all we are ordering because she has someone else drop it off and doesn't come back to us until we are finally able to flag her down 15 minutes later. We order cheeseburger sliders and a sizzling chicken and cheese.  The sliders were alright, no big complaints. The sizzling chicken and cheese was depressing. It was barely sizzling, the mashed potatoes were almost a liquid, and the cheese was unmelted sliced cheese thrown on. I get this entree fairly often, probably at least once or twice a month because it's semi Atkins friendly. This is NOT what it normally comes out looking/tasting like.  Maybe they are better during the day, but they need more people with better training at night. Don't be a late night restaurant/bar if you aren't equipped for it.

I was with a family of ten and when we arrived we were excited to see how many empty tables there were for 7 pm on a Saturday night. But we were quite surprised to find out the wait would be one hour. During our wait, I noticed several servers just standing around and maybe about six parties were served before us. After asking the host how much longer our wait would be they informed us they were waiting on a particular party to finish with their table so we could be seated and they stated they couldn't seat us elsewhere due to the amount of servers on this shift. I understand if they are short staffed and everyone in my party continued to give this Friday's the benefit of the doubt since we've previously received great service at this location. I ordered the endless appetizers & my loaded potato skins came out disgustingly crispy and dry. Our server Nicholes was sweet and seemed like he was doing the best he could so I'm not complaining about him at all (especially because he seemed new & I know very well it can take a while to get the hang of a new job).

241,Steven C.,"Corona, CA",16,8,,1.0,2016-09-11,"Can i do 1/4 of a star? Just because I actually like their food? Their jack daniels menu is awesome... half off appetizers all day on Sunday is great.. but.... OMG!! This location is better off being a Fast Food restaurant!! Customer service is completely non-existant! Never coming back! It's a joke. Me and my family waited for 20 minutes for an open table, even though there were 4 open tables.. we waited 10 minutes for the hostess to come out of the back of the restaurant. Then another 10 minutes for them to figure out their life, before we got sat to a table that was open the whole time we were waiting!! A busser came to us and attempted to seat us, but when we said that we were being helped by the hostess, he said ""well that's just how it is.."" then gave my wife an ugly look and stood there for 2 minutes looking irritated like we spoke French to him or asked for his kidney.. I get that this may be your part time job, but if you don't like it.. QUIT! Then we waited another 15 minutes and finally a server came to  take our drink order. And the only reason someone came was because my wife had to stand up and raise her hand! We were there to celebrate my son's bday.. so if it wasn't for him we would have left! By the time we got our food we were already there for an hour and 15 mins. We got there at 8:45pm. We got our food around 10:30pm.. the dining area was almost empty but the bar area was maybe half full.. I saw at least 6 servers and almost everyone had their food already. 2 of the servers were busy chatting up a couple of girls while the other servers were nowhere to be found. We got our food and ate in like 15 minutes. Then asked for the check and to go boxes. They had dropped off the check and took another 15 minutes to even see the server come out of the back. But by then I had had enough and was walking with the check and my credit card to find anybody I can to give it to so I can pay. Staff were walking right past me like I didn't exist! Finally my server came running from the back with one box and a bag. ""I told her nevermind I don't need a to go box and I just wanted to pay and leave."" So we did and left, and will never be back again! I have worked in customer service since I was 15 years old. First at McDonalds, then at a hotel and now as a nurse! Never have I ran into such disregard for customer service and hospitality. As a customer I felt unwelcomed, under appreciated and I have never been treated so low like me and my family were a Burden to them.

We ordered a few appetizers, a basket of fries, and speciality drinks. The happy hour is awesome: half off appetizers, and drinks are cheap.  The outdoor patio is also considered the ""bar"" area during happy hour so it was awesome. When it started to get a little cooler, someone came out and turned on all the heat lamps and it felt amazing.  The only things I didn't really like were the nachos appetizer and the ranch that we asked for with our basket of fries. The quality of everything tasted so cheap and generic... Just so bland! But why am I surprised considering it is a generic chain restaurant? I've had much better nachos at other places. & the ranch tasted almost like mayo. It tasted like the cheapest store brand of ranch anyone could buy. I was not impressed.

She asked for my ID, gave her my CA ID and she just stared at me instead of saying ""hey can I have one that's not expired"". When I finally look up at her she's like ""I need one that's not expired."" With attitude so I have her my license and she took About 10 minutes to finally give us our drinks. When she did she took about about 12 to come and ask if we were ready to order. We ordered, got our food and we got refills on our drinks. She took about 30 minutes to acknowledge us! She was too busy being best friends with some guy who sat close to us at the bar too. She was standing in front of us the WHOLE time yip yapping away and not ONCE did she turn to ask how we were doing! After she finally realized we were there, she asked if we were okay.

69,Erik J.,"Lakewood, CA",265,32,15.0,1.0,2016-10-26,"Well, I guess there is always room for a new low. The manager, John, needs to rethink what he does for a living, outside of the service industry, and being support for his staff, as he isn't good at either. It seems there was a bit of a glitch in the monitor in the kitchen, or some such thing, that prevented them from seeing the complete order. That is a bummer, but it happens. John, the manager delivered the food to our table of 5, in a virtually empty restaurant (Assuming 15-20% capacity) When he brought out the food for the other 4 at the table, I mentioned to him that there was a plate missing. Ten minutes, or so go by before anyone came back by, and still no missing plate. John, the excellent manager that he is, never came back by to say a single word about the missing meal, knowing good and well, that there was an issue, first hand. He'd rather have the waiter deal with it. After, no exaggeration, a half hour goes by, I asked the waiter to be sure the manager brings out the missing plate of food whenever it is finally ready. Finally, he shows up with the mediocre plate of chicken and broccoli that took 30 minutes to prepare. I mentioned to him, my disappointment, and asked why he hadn't stopped by sooner to help his waiter with the issue of an unhappy table. He had the gall to say that ""we have the waiters handle their own table and take ownership of them"". I was a little surprised by this, especially with him knowing first hand that there was an issue of a missing plate, and let him know I thought it was his responsibility to handle these types of situations for the wait staff. His response was, ""well, this is how we roll"". SERIOUSLY?! Well, John, good luck with that manager position. I recommend you find something a bit more suited to you, like bar-back, or keeping the trash receptacles empty. Save your money, and get some Subway. They have better management, and service.

JD CHICKEN w/ that excellent glaze YUMM MY GIRLFRIEND ON THE OTHER HAND, gets the shrim pasta w/ a side of sautéed mushrooms.  Now, when the order came my girlfriend noticed upon mixing the mushrooms with the pasta ( an odd texture to the mushrooms ) I was like no way ask for them to change them.  Are waiter, kind young lady did so rite away.  She was not the problem, I still left her a tip.  Anywho, we thought the problem was resolved, the waiter said she specifically told the cook that the other mushrooms were dry. We got the same out come,  Same dry stale, not even hot, no steam coming from the """" fresh plate """" As I told my girlfriend , being a great cook that I am, i know that was from the same batch that the cook has on the side that's been lying in the kitchen if not for 1-3 hours to make him life easier when those small orders come in.  THATS A GREAT QUALITY RITE ??????  Wow discussed me.  Being the friendly person my girlfriend is she didn't want to start a scene.  So i of course got a bit angered by that but I knew she would then get mad at me if I started a scene. So i then said to myself, we could've fixed it verbally with the manager with no problem not wanting nothing in exchange. Instead here goes this yelp review.  get some better quality cooks, God even Mexican independent joints have better quality.  For the price of the food at TGI , nobody should even have to complain about stuff like that.  Moral of the story.  - Sautéed mushrooms were stale like grilled chicken being left out for a day , texture is like a piece of thin flexible wood.  - Asked for a new batch ( SAME SH*T ) - means cook had those laying around for hours.

47,Jason W.,"Cerritos, CA",401,39,73.0,1.0,2017-01-28,"If I could give a 0, I would. Well, a one is deserving, because for the most part, the staff was nice, although they did forget a number of our orders and we ended up having to ask for them multiple times. This place used to be one of favorites to go to, but today simply upset me. They seemed to re-brand recently, which pretty much means, higher prices. For the same meal, you're paying a lot more and the quality of the food isn't even good across the board. Part of this re-branding came with a new menu (looks great) and the like. As I looked through the photos, I saw a picture of some fries that looked seasoned. It got my tasted buds going and so I ordered them (SEASONED fries). When the fries came out, there was nothing on them and twice, I was assured that was the SEASONED fries. Supposedly, the seasoning is plain salt (or possibly sea salt), but no special seasoning of any sort and nothing like what was on the menu. Sure a picture in a menu doesn't show you what your actual meal is going to look like, but clearly, this was misleading. I was upset the rest of the evening. Our appetizers came out after some of the meal, they forgot drinks, the table was sticky and the clam chowder was not good at all. For the price, I could have gone to a much fancier restaurant. Sadly, this is where we ended up. It's hard for me to write this, because the servers were nice, but ultimately, it is corporate that needs to look at this. I'll choose the fancy place down the street. When about to get the bill, my brother asked to use one of his rewards. It was such a hassle compared to the previous times that he used his rewards and the server even asked him to write down the information and left (I don't think this was an issue, but he didn't ask if it was okay, it was just like ... here, do this). At the end of the night, they gave us the wrong bill and eventually had to track down the new one.  Am I bickering? Maybe a bit, but it does take a lot to get a bad review from me and this was one of those moments. Unless you're looking for regular fries, don't be mislead by the SEASONED fries and don't let the re-branding fool you, you're paying more for the same food, which isn't so great anyway. There needs to be more than a new menu and new (higher) prices when you re-brand and this one definitely fell very, very short.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=40,3.4,2.37,2.296,2.084,2.7820000000000005

112,Denise F.,"Whittier, CA",2,16,8.0,1.0,2017-02-19,"2/4/17 We went to Cerritos TGIF Fridays on a Saturday early evening. There was a short wait but nothing ridiculous, after a few minutes we sat at a table in the bar area which was first come first serve. Our waiter never introduced himself, He cleared the table brought put menu in the table and walked away saying nothing. I know I shouldn't assume but I just thought to myself he was just the one bussing tables. After about 20 minutes of no awknowledgment we stopped that same man when he went by asked for a kids menu that was not offered and he got it and left, no drinks, no offer of appetizers nothing. 10 minutes later he said are you ready. We ordered our appetizers and decided it best to get the whole order going. Drinks appetizers and dinner. He took the order didn't ask what dipping sauce we wanted didn't give us a chance to ask and brought what he felt we should have. We stopped him asked for blue cheese for our appetizer platter and he brought it and walked away. Not even a anything else I can get you, when he took our order he didnt know the menu, asked us for sides that didnt even cone with what we ordered. still my thought was maybe hes new, overwhelned, or just not personable. Thats ok. Then my boyfriend took a bite of one if the hot wings I got a potato skin that was still on the frozen/refrigerated side. And we both looked at each other mine is really cold I told him he said but at least its not raw. The wing was completely reddish pink and sorry to gross you all out bloody. Every one already had one on their plate kids didn't pay attention being they covered it in blue cheese and had eaten it. We told them not to eat it and called over our waiter and his response was yea its a little bit raw but its ok. I said NO its not ok. I want you to take this platter away and let them know they are serving raw potentially dangerous chicken. He took the platter said nothing else to us and walked away, no offer of something else, no I will take it off your bill, I will have a word with the manager and cook, NOTHING. He proceeded to bring our dinner. We let the older kids order from the adult menu and the waiter set down one of the kids steak and shrimp and I said I'm sorry that shrimp is burnt, again nothing he ignored me, I said it again and his response yeah a littke bit. I said it shouldn't be burnt at all. He did nothing, set down the rest of the plates, one kid ordered ribs again adult menu, there were 4 small ribs on the huge plate they served it on with a sprinkling of frenchbfries and the coleslaw we said we didn't want. My boyfriend and I ordered the fajitas 2 meat combo to share since we tbought we would be eating appetizers as well. There had to be about 5 strips of chicken amnd the equivalent if not less of steak. I was done I stood up ask him if he said anything to anyone about yhe chicken he said yes I think and that was it I said call a manager he which he did she came over I explained the problems we had and stated we didn't eat anything, im5not paying for anything we are done. I asked her how they can charge $17 dollars for a plate of 4 ribs with a few fries and whatever the steak and burnt shrimp costs and be ok with what they put in front of us. She had no answer except to say well you can't leave until you pay for that beer, my boyfriend had almost entirely drank. She didn't ask if we had paid for it already which he did after our 20 minute then 10 minute wait for a drink order. He walked up to the bar ordered and paid. She just assumed we were trying to get it by. We would have pd ith pleasure for a satisfactory service ans meal, neither of which we got. No I'm sorry how can I fix this, let me make this right, NOTHING. So I guess if the person supervising the staff, our waiter is subpar then you need to expect that thenpeople under them would be too. We usually go to the Brea location and will from now on only go to the Brea location. Do they not understand that they not only had poor service, poor judgement, poor food and food presentation but they could have made one or all of use extremely sick? Good Lucknif you eat here, I don't recommend the chicken in anyvway, shape, or form. Order from the kids menu its the same portion apparently but cheaper. And this whole unlimited appetizer hype is crap. You have to get the same appetizer and you can't share it with your table because they will charge you for another order. Think that advertisment needs to be stated a bit more clearly. Also don't advertise on your website for Cerritos in big letters and pictures that its Happy Hour all day everyday, if its not. I showed the server what it stated on my phone on their website and he said no it says that but its not happy hour, I'm sorry I thought I was there on a day considered any day and during the hour of all day. Ridiculous I asked for clarification as to why thats advertised and not honored and got a deer in headlights look with no response.

Our party just hung out at the bar to kill time, but around 8:15 we were all starving. We asked how much longer it would be but were consistently told ambiguously answers i.e. ""There are two large parties ahead of you... Just 10-15 more minutes."" We weren't allowed to sit at the tables near the bar either because we had a couple underage folks with us. Long story short, we had to wait another hour; total of 2 hours. I understand it gets busy or if they're understaffed, but they should have been honest or given us a better wait-time estimate. Don't lie just to keep our business cause then you get pissed off customers. After 2 hours of waiting we were finally seated... and then after we ordered, it took awhile to get our food too... :/ I hear they're under new management? I don't know, it was my first time there.

I'd suggest if you can deny taking the drink off the tab, leave it on the table before you make that decision.  And if the manager is the one to make that decision, he or she should be the one to explain it to the patrons and not relay it to the server. The two stars is for the manager on duty or maybe the policy and or process concerning drinks that are subjectively undesirable, not the server by any means.   The food was okay, not anything to crave over, the dozen or so fries was a good portion.  But props to the chicken quesadilla, that was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=40,2.88,2.48,2.28,2.3440000000000003,2.64

RAKEEN was very attentive and apologized on the other servers behalf, he tried to perfect our experience & made sure he did everything he could to get our disappointment out of the way to be able to enjoy our dinner. im highly satisfied with employees like RAKEEN that bring in their positivity to the edge of the table they're serving to make it a positive experience for everyone!

Amber: ""Whuuuteverrr!!!"" ______________________  Two decades after its release this 90's coming of age saga featuring Alicia Silverstone and Stacey Dash proves to be all the more relevant. Not in terms of my personal life.  Ohhh no, hunny. I'm far too old for high school drama, but as it appears, chain restaurants rarely ever outgrow the stigmatisms that are affordability............. by way of mediocrity. In advance know that yes, I drove from frikkin' DTLA to Cerritos in anticipation of an above par experience here. Consider this review an epilogue of ""buyer's remorse"". Bypassing the Fridays location in Ladera simply because it's out of the way and/or the additionally nearby location in Compton........ FOR OBVIOUS REASONS, I resorted to Yelp whilst observing 1.5 stars to be the rough average for NINE of the franchise's locations, within their entirety. I thought they declared peace in the Middle East. No bueno. Pulled up and while the area this eatery rest within is lovely, upon walking in was I stricken with an epiphany towards why it's been eons since my last visit here. - We were NOT GREETED. - The sticky, debris filled floors were an absolute abomination and Heaven help us..... - The food at this place is something out of a damned concentration camp.  With Anne Frank nowhere in sight I thought perhaps by concentrating things would take a turn for the better. Ahhh,...... no such luck as when the food and beverages arrived (2 orders of buffalo wings, an order of fries, a slider, artichoke dip and a shrimp cocktail......I felt like quite the heifer), to be ""frank"", NOTHING WAS WORTH THE BRAIN STORM! The wings were rubbery.  Think,.... that yellow chicken that Johnny Carson used to keep behind his desk for gag relief.  Was this a joke??? Did I stumble into some bad lighting??? No seriously. EVERYTHING we were served was either lukewarm or seemed to be someone else's reheated leftovers​. The artichoke dip was more evocative of hummus and the chips were stale. To further it, you know THE STRUGGLE IS REAL when the shrimp cocktail is the WARMEST portion of your entire damned meal!!!! With this derived a discussion. AS IT APPEARS, SERVING LUKEWARM, LACKLUSTER PROVENDER IS THE COMMON DENOMINATOR BETWEEN ALL OF THE TGI FRIDAY'S LOCATIONS I'VE EVER VISITED! From Ladera throughout Rancho Cucamonga and San Bernardino, it's as if employees are trained to stand idly while text messaging and scratching their asses to allow one's food time enough to chill and congeal, prior to popping out of hibernation just in time enough to present it to guests prior to their having collapsed from undeniably preventable starvation. Note: THE ONLY REASON WHY this joint is receiving 2 stars as opposed to the bare minimum is because I believe in reviewing fairly and our server, Donnie, proved to be the ""Baldwin"" of this booze brothel as he scurried to and fro throughout our session of dining, in a semi-bionic manner while serving EVERY table within the bar portion of the ENTIRE establishment. * Simply put, THIS GUY DESERVES A DAMNED RAISE! Upon receiving it, I'd recommend he quit. Donnie take my advice, accept the pay increase, leave and do something good for humanity! At the end of the day, $12 endless apps and/or late night ""Happy Hour"" or not, it all just as easily boils down to one inevitable conclusion: ___________________________ Cher:  ""TGI Friday's is a full-on Monet."" Tai:  ""What's a monet?"" Cher: ""It's like a painting, see? From far away, it's OK, but up close, it's a BIG OLE' MESS!"" ____________________________ Verdict: [---- I will never....... repeat NEVERRRR patronize another gaht' damned, God forsaken TGI Friday's as long as the fart stenched Southern California air continues to pollute my already 2nd hand nicotine exposed lungs!----] Why you ask? . . .

About 15 minutes later my sisters plate came out and her wings were cold like they were sitting and my food had not come out. We let the server know and she said ok I'll get you some fresh ones. I then put in another appetizer order since it was clearly taking a while. About another 30 minutes pass and no food has come out and we brought it to the attention of the server twice and finally my sister wings appear and still nothing for me. And to top it off the wings were cold again. We got the manager and let him know the situation and he comped most of our bill. So we only paid $6 for the eaten pot stickers.

26,Deseree F.,"Cypress, CA",0,3,,1.0,2017-09-10,"This was my first time at this location, and unfortunately my last.  We came in for dinner & drinks before our movie on Friday & it was a HUGE mistake.  Thank god I only ordered fries, but my cousin & his girlfriend both ordered steak with lobster/salmon. The steak was 100% ROTTEN. Reason why we know, it smelled as if the meat had been sitting out in the heat for hours. The seafood had obviously been sitting out far too long along with their veggies due to their cold, dry, shriveled up appearance. I've worked in the food industry for almost 8 years as a server/bartender, and I have NEVER smelled food that was served to a customer like that. We notified the manager and our server after they finally appeared. The moment they both smelled the steaks they disappeared into the kitchen with the food for what seemed like an eternity. We had to ask ANOTHER server to please get them to comp those plates so we can make it to our movie, and even then they made us wait. We were halfway out of the door completely over it when the server chased us down with our bills. Of course all of our drinks that we never received were still on the bill. So we waited, again. Meanwhile my family is in the parking lot immediately starting to feel sick. The manager was very apologetic but honestly these things should never happen if your managing correctly. Did any of the cooking staff go through the food handlers education? I really hope the rest of the management sees this review and goes through their meat and poultry thoroughly prior to allowing it to be served to customers. Thank God my cousin and his girlfriend knew right away that something was wrong with that food. Sadly they both got sick right before our movie on our way in and didn't even have a chance to get dinner that night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=20,2.8,2.82,2.372,1.8920000000000003,2.812

The moment I walked in, I noticed how bright and welcoming the place was. Not some dumpy old school restaurant. kudos on design! I was surprised to see that on a Saturday night around 730pm, there was no wait and no long line (9/16/17). We ""called ahead"" since they do not take reservations and was seated promptly after our party arrived. Lisa was our server and was very attentive with all our orders, refills and service. If there was any delay in order delivery, she would give us a heads up which was awesome. My brother in law had to leave for a brief period of time (unsure if he would end up joining us for dinner) she she had the manager remove the coke we ordered for him without us asking. When he informed us he would be back and we could order his food and drink, she got the order in for us again. When his burger was ready and sitting at his place at the table, she came back 5 mins after to offer to place it under a heat lamp to prevent the burger from getting cold. This is what I call great service. Thinking of step ahead and always on top of things. Before we left, she even offered to have our leftover drinks placed in a to go cup if we chose to.

The rice pilaf also smelled like it was old, it tasted ok, but it didn't smell right, so we did not continue eating it! I got the pilaf with some salmon which was good! It was cooked well done, just how I like it! And the jack Daniels sauce brought a nice sweetness to it!

We tried using the tablet device on the table, but the pay feature didn't work. When she finally came to give us the check, we WISH we had perfect change, but nope we again had to wait & wait.
