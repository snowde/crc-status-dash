6,Dave H.,"Severn, MD",0,3,,1.0,2014-09-06,"Ordered pick 3 appetizer. Pot sticker dough was raw, pretzel sticks were black, and got boneless wings instead of the regular wings. Sent it back and 2nd order was just as bad. The server didn't even ask if 2nd order was ok...and never told mgr my meals were bad.

4,Bj H.,"North Philadelphia, PA",9,3,1.0,4.0,2014-09-20,I just had the Cajun shrimp and chicken and it had to be the best dish I had since I been to Friday's. I also love the new recipe for the mozzarella sticks to bad I didn't get the all you can eat ones though. I wasn't a big fan of this place but if they all served the food like I had today it will be a lot better shrug,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chambersburg-2?start=20,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48
2,Luca B.,"Waynesboro, PA",4,21,10.0,2.0,2014-09-27,"Usually like Fridays, usually go to the Gettysburg location and had a good time. This time I went for an appetizer promo , to start I mention I'm interested in The promotion and the waitress starts to apologize that they don't have two selections that  they used to have ( fried green beans ) that the waitress said were great. Why in the world would you start off with apologies , unfortunately I would be getting many more before this outing was over. I ordered the new spicy chicken tostadas app and my beautiful wife had Sizzling chicken with mashed potatoes. ( which she enjoyed - that  plus the 2 tasty beverages warranted the 2 stars rating).  So its friday ""datenight"" around 6pm an the place is starting to fill up but there is no wait to be seated a plus! Multiple tables around us are empty/ being seated or turning over with new diners. We order our drinks , my apps and Her Entrée. Drinks arrive with little delay and we are sipping them as we watch others who came after us Get their appetizers. Then they start getting their main courses. Our drinks are half gone and our Kind and professional waitress returns apologizing again, asking if we need more drinks. In about 10 minutes The chicken entrée arrives still no app for me in sight. I ask the waitress to please bring some kind of food to the table for me and ask for a manager. She apologizes third time and says the managers in the back trying to help get my appetizers after legitimately 50 minutes wait for a new promotional item. It Ultimately arrives at the table 5 minutes later and by this time my beverage is empty and I'm not happy. The five round tortilla chips have a small lump of shredded spiced chicken a tablespoonful or so of coleslaw and a fresh Jalapeño pepper slice then are drizzled with a dressing and had a Dollop of Guacamole on the side ,  very nice Presentation and tasted good. I place another order of this endless appetizer when they arrive and waitress Apologizes and said this won't be too long, minutes later she returns and mentions they are out of fresh peppers do I mind if they use canned peppers, Sure why not, and still no manager to speak to. We Finish and get our check never to talk to anyone, I have to say it was not the waitress's fault so she had to get a ok tip but the fact that the So-called manager couldn't make it to my table to hear my concerns so Unprofessional! Won't be back to this location for sure!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chambersburg-2?start=20,,,,,
5,Nicole M.,"Saint Thomas, PA",0,3,,1.0,2015-01-18,I would have given them 0 stars. We got there at 1:00 and it wasn't busy. The table beside sat right before us. The waitress took there drink or and got there drinks and came back and took there food orders before even getting our drink order. She finally did take our drink order. She came back at 1:30 to take our food order and we still didn't have our drinks yet. So after sitting therefor 1/2 hr without even having a drink or food order put in we left. Never again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chambersburg-2?start=20,,,,,
1,Vanilla J.,"Corolla, NC",0,35,2.0,1.0,2015-04-02,"Getting worse.  I met a group of friends for evening drinks and $12 endless apps.  Many of the appetizers were not fully cooked.  We noted this especially on the pot stickers.  While we could see the cooking staff from our seated area, we weren't impressed.  There is a difference in having fun at work and simply not caring about your work.  Really sad I can't say better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chambersburg-2?start=20,,,,,
21,Jane T.,"Cleveland, OH",1,21,37.0,4.0,2015-08-14,"My family and I stayed in Chambersburg, PA in August 2015 for a few days. We ended up needing food a couple of times in the later hours and TGI Friday's was within close range of our hotel. A few of us went over and ate and some of us got take out. The only thing that we were not crazy about was the Tennessee Whiskey Cake. It was really dried out, and I didn't pick up on any reason to call it a ""whiskey cake"" in the flavor. It was a fun place to hang out and wind down before going to the hotel to sleep. They offer a nice variety for take out as well if you just want to get some things and munch at the hotel. They have a nice kids menu as well that offers a lot of choices and some healthy sides instead of just the typical fries or applesauce.

27,Stephanie C.,"Waterfall, PA",6,142,1.0,4.0,2015-08-31,As far as chain restaurants go this place was great. Food came quickly and correctly. Drinks we surprisingly good at the bar and cheap too. A solid option for a drink after work in Chambersburg.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chambersburg-2,,,,,
22,John G.,"Chambersburg, PA",0,57,47.0,2.0,2015-09-27,"""Mediocre"" is the first word that comes to mind when thinking about T.G.I. Friday's.  Prior to the late-2000's, I was a big fan of T.G.I. Friday's. I absolutely loved the fried mac & cheese bites, but like so many other menu items, T.G.I. Friday's has dropped them since then. Now, the menu is more limited and the menu is smaller. I used to order the bruschetta chicken pasta quite a bit, but the portions have gotten much smaller. An entree doesn't even come with any sides at TGI, so you're left with nothing but a small portion of pasta. People must agree, because the place is always dead. The service, however, has always been solid. They have a loyalty program where you earn Stripes and get free meals after collecting a certain amount, so that's about the only reason I go in anymore.  Unless you ""earn Stripes"" through their loyalty program, Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse across Norland Ave. are better choices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chambersburg-2,,,,,
20,Ryan D.,"Chambersburg, PA",5,21,,2.0,2015-11-12,"My wife, son and I went here on Nov 11 for dinner and the following happened. We got seated right away but waited 10 minutes for a server to greet us and get our drink orders. Our server didn't know ""who's table this was"" but served us anyway with a trainee. My wife asked for a refil of water 2 times before getting it. And lastly $10.50 for 4 stuffes jalapenos. . .jeez.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chambersburg-2,,,,,
28,Nick F.,"Waterford, VT",122,1,1.0,1.0,2016-01-02,"Food was cold. Took forever to get food. Bartender was ""overwhelmed"" and took forever just to get an iced tea. Absolutely terrible experience.

3,Kim S.,"Chambersburg, PA",0,2,,1.0,2016-01-10,"My husband and I just stopped in for lunch. We were the only ones sitting at the bar for football Sunday.  We ordered boneless wings. The celery was dirty and slimy. We told the bartender and he said he told the manager. The Manager never came out to say anything. The right thing to do was take this off of our bill. This didn't happen. We could see the kitchen from where we sat. Our food sat in the window for 7 minutes before it was brought out to us. Food was cold and my chicken was spongy and had several burnt spots on it. Also, the bathroom did not have hand soap. I'm not sure how the employees are washing their hands. Just gross! We will not be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chambersburg-2?start=20,,,,,
13,Tanya Y.,"Virginia Beach, VA",103,115,494.0,2.0,2016-02-28,"We went on a busy Saturday night.  Waited about 15 minutes for a party of 3 to be seated.  When we sat down, we were greeted right away. Service was ok and the staff was nice.   I didn't like that when we received our appetizers, there were no utensils or plates to eat with.  We waited about 5 mins before finding one of the servers for utensils and plates.  By the time we ate our appetizer,  it was cold. As far as the food, I was not impressed.  My son ordered a build your own burger.   I realized the waitress did not ask what temp he wanted.  When he received it, the burger was tough and dry.  I ordered the 10 0z rib eye and half ribs.  I ordered my steak med rare.  I love rib eye but for some reason the texture of the steak was different.  It wasn't has tender and juicy as it should be.  The ribs were over cooked and dry.  As far as the sides,  I got the mac n cheese and spinach.   The spinach was very greasy and oily.  To be honest,  everything was.   I used to love tgi fridays or maybe this one is different than the other ones I've been to.  Either way, I won't be returning anymore.   The food has gone down hill and there are better chain restaurants out there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chambersburg-2,,,,,
25,David H.,"Milan, NM",4,43,28.0,3.0,2016-02-28,"As far as TGIFs go it's a little disappointing due to the fact this location is a franchise and doesn't honor the typical TGIF deals. However, outside of that the service is a little slow for what doesn't seem to be any good reason. The food does meet the standards and the consistency that you expect a chain restaurant to. Which is fairly good but given the fact that this is a large corporation you go in with a somewhat larger expectation of greater service, better deals available. Chances are you know what a TGIF entails and this was just my take on this establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chambersburg-2,,,,,
18,Allison S.,"Newville, PA",2,27,23.0,3.0,2016-04-10,"The service is typically a hit or miss with this particular TGI Fridays. This is one of my favorite chain sit-down restaurants, and it's always disappointing when you get poor service. We had to ask the waitress to send a steak back 3 times before it was finally well-done. They're also pretty forgetful about remembering to get refills on drinks, chips, etc. I'm also disappointed they no longer have the Hibachi Chicken Skewers! I tried the Jack Daniels grilled chicken sandwich, however, and it was very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chambersburg-2,,,,,

Endless appetizers is on and they were fine. Just fine, no biggie.  Three stars is because they had Corona Light and my server Maggie is by far the coolest chic I've seen in Chambersburg. Stylish without trying and she sang the top 40's music they were pumping through the speakers. I like it! I'm a fan of a letting your personality show.  Thank Gawd I'm off tomorrow!

17,Michelle F.,"Chambersburg, PA",1,17,1.0,4.0,2016-11-05,"Hubs and I haven't been to TGI Fridays in years since we are locals.  We had a few bad experiences and decided to start going elsewhere.  We decided to stop by on Friday night and sat at the bar so there wouldn't be a wait. The good:  Nice service.  I got the rare prime rib and Jack Daniels (fried) shrimp with macaroni and cheese and a tomato/mozzarella side.  The prime rib was really good and cooked properly.  The shrimp were genuinely amazing.  If I went again, I'd consider just getting the JD fried shrimp.  Food took an average amount of time.  Hubs got the smothered chicken and shrimp with mashed potatoes.  The chicken was amazing. The bad:  Hubs's shrimp in the smothered chicken and shrimp were killed.  We wouldn't order the grilled shrimp again.  Way overcooked.  It is odd that the ""smothered"" part is now cheese on the hot dish with the food on top--no cheese on top of the food, which is odd.  The mashed potatoes were really good.  Most of the food was good.  One of the special drinks, long island iced tea, wasn't drinkable.  A couple sips and it got discarded--super syrupy and much different than it should be. Summary:  The smothered chicken and JD fried shrimp were superb.  Avoid smothered or otherwise grilled shrimp which are overdone.  Avoid the long island iced tea.  I can genuinely say this is the best fried shrimp I've gotten in this area.  Mac and cheese is an impressive side dish.  if getting the tomato and mozzarella dish ask for extra sauce since it was almost dry but good with extra sauce.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chambersburg-2,,,,,

As I was carrying at the time, the sign was a problem. Later, I learned that they have a position on this: ""It is a corporate policy that we do not allow firearms of any caliber into our stores unless carried by a police officer on duty for the protection of our many valued guests.""

I even ask the server if he would watch my bottle, less then 1/2, order another. Still, slow. I ask for chips & salsa, mentioned we would like it before our meal.

I noticed garbage on the floor :(  When we left I did see another full table so, I don't understand the time issue.
