4,Lauren L.,"Gurnee, IL",9,97,11.0,1.0,2012-02-17,"Horrible, horrible, horrible.  Do not go here.  The service was bad and the food was worse.  I know it is to be expected that chain food is not going to blow my mind, but I truly am not a picky eater.  I love chain food but this place is awful.  I doubt I will ever go back to a TGI Fridays at any location. We got the 2 for $10 deal.  The appetizers were large, but nothing special, clearly just frozen and thrown in a deep fryer. I ordered some sort of pasta Alfredo with chicken.  It was one of the smallest portions I've ever gotten in a  restaurant.  The pasta was so overcooked it was mushy.  The Alfredo was caked onto the bottom of the plate, to the point were most of it would not come off.  The chicken was so overcooked I could barely cut into it. Not the mention the place is constantly crawling with college kids, making ti so loud you can barely have a conversation. Save yourself the time and money and avoid this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-champaign,,,,,
