41,Jasmine B.,"Charlotte, NC",80,281,161.0,5.0,2012-03-10,"TGI Fridays has been my favorite sit-in restaurant since I can remember. And today was a great example of why. Can't remember the waitress's name, but she was so nice and patient with my lunch party. I am very big on good service in restaurants and she did a great job. The food was wonderful - I'm glad the Oreo Madness dessert is back on the menu. At one point it was gone for a few years, but I'm glad it's back now. I had the Jack Daniels Baby Back Ribs (Full-Rack) with fries (and no cole-slaw). Wonderful meal. Great service! Went around 12:30pm for lunch, and we were seated immediately and did not have to wait long for our appetizers or entrees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlotte-3?start=60,2.612,2.612,2.612,2.612,2.6120000000000005

The hostess was so adorable! She welcomed us in, immediately walked us to our table and then said she hoped we enjoyed our visit and our waitress would be over soon. It is so refreshing to have nice host and hostesses when you walk into a restaurant. In my opinion it sets the tone for the visit.  Our waitress came over right after and took our drink orders, I tried the blue raspberry lemonade. They are made with a mix and shaved ice...a little pricey at just over $3 but they are unlimited so enjoy as many as you can! I loved it...very refreshing and light and had a very unique taste!  For the meal I opted for the Pick 2 for $10. I had the fried mozzarella and Friday's shrimp. The fried mozzarella came out hot and crispy, the cheese melted after each bite and it was a lot in the basket! I was very impressed! The shrimp were delicious again they came out hot and it was a full order, so the shrimp covered the fries....I always ask for  a side of that yummy Jack Daniels sauce on the side...which were a great compliment for the shrimp.  Our service was great from the moment we walked in the door and the food was hot and prepared just as ordered.

Upon agreeing to eat at TGI Fridays, we pulled into this TGI Fridays location. Long story short, our meals and appetizers where great! But the waitress we had by the name of Alex (a female) was horrible..So bad to the point that we had to get the manager just to get our glasses of water refilled.       I am and always have been a fan of TGI Fridays, I love their food, and even more so their cocktail drinks. Just about every other time I've gone there, their service is spot on. But I don't know what the deal was with this woman Alex not wanting to do her job. Needless to say,me and my wife to be left a tip of $0.00.      If you go to this location, and your waitress has a badge that says ""Alex"", either go sit at the bar, or ask for another server (if she still works there).      Just a (somewhat) quick heads up ;-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlotte-3?start=60,1.864,1.864,1.864,1.864,1.864

The waitress ""I think she said she was from Buffallo"" completely abandoned our table. I mean disappeared. I stood at the bar for no less than fifteen minutes trying to get someone's attention but just got the backs of their heads. So I had to get my wife outside, she was getting sick, then I was going to go back in and try again to pay the check, and i hadn't made it back from the car when a cop comes out of no where and rudely started accusing us of skipping out on the bill and made a rude comment about my poor wife being drunk. Who has a dick head cop waiting around to harass customers? She doesn't drink. The story didn't get better when I dealt with the blonde headed manager who had been ignoring me at the bar. Being mean doesn't make you less ignorant. Bottom line, poison food, angry wait staff, possible illegal collusion. It was like being set up by a bunch of crack heads.

The food was lackluster to say the least but the service was outstandingly horrific. After waiting almost 40 minutes for our food to arrive with nary a server to explain the debacle our food finally arrived. Still no acknowledgement of the long wait for the food although it did arrive hot. It's temperature is about the only positive thing I can mention. My 3 pattied big burger arrived with a single lonely little patty covered in a heaping amount of pungent onions. Had I not requested no onions this may have been a good thing. As I look over at my daughter's chicken and shrimp sizzler I saw a familiar sight. Onions. Had she not requested no onions this again, may have been a good thing. I inquired as to where my other patties were from my long lost server and she said she could take away my meal and have it fixed. I said thank you anyway I'll keep what I have but would love it if you could bring me back the correct burger. I was afraid I may suffer from starvation before the correct burger arrived. After a few moments there's a man standing at the end of my table staring at me. Didn't say a word just stared. I looked up and said, ""Yes?"" He replied with, ""You had a problem with your burger?"". I explained to him the situation and his response was nonexistent. With a mere ""Sooooo... Do you want to keep your burger then?"" My $14 hamburger that could have been a candidate for carbon dating as it was cooked to oblivion (I told you it was hot) was less than stellar. As well as the rest of my family's dinner.  What I can only assume was the manager explained a lot of why this place has averaged 2.5 stars. The service was atrocious and without apology. You can almost deal with a bad meal if at least the service is exceeding or at least meeting par. There was no saving grace to be found here. Except for maybe the Wendy's that was across the street that we were able to order Frosties to wash down this horrible experience.

33,Angellica R.,"Hickory, NC",0,5,,2.0,2016-08-29,"On Friday, 8.26.16, around 3:00pm.  My husband and I wanted to eat at this TGI Friday's in Charlotte, NC on Northlake Mall Dr.  It was not the best service that day that we had experienced on previous occasions.  The greeter was less than friendly.  We spoke first, he barely spoke at all and did not smile at all. He did however seat us rather quickly, because it was not busy at that time.  Once seated, we waited 15 minutes and no one came to take not even our drink order.  We decided to leave and went to PF Chang's.  The experience there was night and day.  We were very pleased at PFC's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlotte-3?start=20,2.04,2.04,2.04,1.704,2.04
55,Tami B.,"Charlotte, NC",31,9,1.0,1.0,2016-08-31,I really don't know how this place stays in business. We had a party of 6 coworkers tonight. Our waiter never smiled or even seemed interested in waiting on us. We all ordered drinks from the bar and waited 20 mins to receive the beers. I had ordered wine and another 10 minutes passed & I never received it. My husband walks into the bar to ask them since our waiter has told us twice it was coming. The bartender said they can't find the corkscrew!!! (Is this really a restaurant?) Finally they find a wine with a screw off top & serve it. I later get charged $13 for a single glass of wine...surprise! Our entrees came out sporadically with at least 10 minutes in between. From the first entree to the delivery of the last one was at least 30 minutes total. One of our guests had to send her's back because it was inedible. If the food was outstanding it might have made this evening easier to swallow but the food was terrible. The manager did give us 20% off our meal but I would rather have had good food & service.

Afterwards, we were super hungry and didn't want to make the 2hr trek back home on an empty stomach. I pulled out my handy dandy Yelp app to see what was open at this hour and had a full bar. Our choices were slim because it was already 11pm. However, you can't go wrong with a chain restaurant. The great thing about this particular location is that it's open until 2am. Sweet! When we arrived, we waited for about 2 minutes before we wondered if we had to seat ourselves. 5 minutes went by and we were finally greeted. The hostess apologized and seated us immediately. Our waitress came by and took our drink orders. While I was breezing through the drink menu, I mentioned margarita, she informed us that frozen and iced margaritas were $3 on Thursdays. Win!!!! I ordered the hot wings and my girl got Jack Daniels steak and we split her double side order of fries. I was super hungry because I don't think I stopped to actually taste the food. The fries were delicious though, I remember that much. The margaritas hit the spot and soothed my craving for citrus and tequila. Our waitress was amazing and patient. She kept the drinks going and chatted with us casually. The place was pretty clean, the staff seemed attentive. The only issue I had here was the bathrooms were a mess.

11,Na S.,"Jamaica, NY",1,22,,1.0,2017-03-22,"Walked in on a Monday night, a few minutes before 9pm, and the place was fairly empty. But, we had to wait a few minutes for the hostess to come back from wherever she was to seat us.  We asked for a booth, she looked around and she said she had to clean one off. Although other booths were available, maybe the sections were closed due to staffing. Anyway, it was the very first booth- I thought she left to get cleaning supplies, but she went to have a conversation, came back to the table to wipe it down, left again to finish her conversation, then finally came back to seat us. After several minutes of waiting, our waiter came over and gave us menus. Our waiter had a hard time remembering things- like, bringing our food to our table. We ordered endless apps, for the three people in our party. 19 minutes later he brings the apps to the table behind us. I heard one of the ladies ask her friends if someone ordered it. I waved to her and asked was that our order of apps and she replied that it must've been. Meanwhile, they told the server and he walked away. I could also hear from that other table that he was messing up their order as well because they ordered meals and not apps.  Three minutes later the server comes back out with more apps that he again, put on the other table. At this point, were were just waiting for him to acknowledge our table. Again, I can hear the women say that it was not their food. The server disappears again.  He comes back out and asked us, did we order endless apps- imagine the looks on our faces. We said yes, and he said that he would be right back (so we have now been waiting approximately 25 minutes for our food). We ended up walking right out. It made no sense to speak to management- for what? To wait another 25 minutes and possibly get a free water!!! Stay away...far, far, away from this location. I gave one star because I had to.

I again asked for tea and my fiancé asked for a mixed drink. Yet another 10 minutes before my tea arrived, and his drink was sitting on the bar that was clearly visible to see from where we sat. Took our order finally.. then another 5 or so minutes passed and she walked by and said, ""your drink should be there soon I guess,"" not paying attention to the fact that it was sitting there getting watered down.

After we finished our meal, my friend clearly told her that our bill was together; Brittany brought back two separate receipts. Not a big deal, but she rolls her eyes after we asked for one bill. To top it all off, she returns to the table with the nastiest attitude, stating that my friend's Visa card had been declined. Clearly something is wrong here. My friend was like, I know that's not right. Let me call my bank."" I said, ""I'll take care of it."" So Brittany snatches MY Visa card, comes back and and loudly says, ""This card is declined, too...SO WHAT Y'ALL PLAN TO DO?!"" OMG! Really?! First of all, who are you speaking to, Young Lady?! I can't stand rudeness at all...especially when I know that both of our cards had more than enough funds to cover the meals. So I give Brittany ANOTHER Visa card, and this one went through. She almost throws it back on the table when she returns. I stated that obviously there was either an issue with Friday's machine or Visa. She just walked away. Even after dealing with her rude and disrespectful demeanor, I still left her a tip, even though she didn't deserve one at all. Overall, it was just the way that the situation was handled. Why would we visit a restaurant if we didn't have the money to pay for our food? Maybe Brittany had a bad experience in the past with non-paying customers, but you shouldn't judge everyone on past experiences with them. I started to speak with the manager, but it wasn't even worth it. Yelp is on point with reviews. I will start to pay more attention to them. I don't care if the food was delicious; if the customer service is poor, it's a wrap.

Ate at the bar though we don't drink alcohol and found that the staff was soooo much happier there than in the rest of the restaurant. They were very attentive and continuously smiling. We will go back just to be waited on by them!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlotte-3,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003
4,Dominique D.,"DeLand, FL",35,17,5.0,1.0,2018-01-07,"An entire new team is needed for this location from manager to hostess. The hostess are so rude, the bar area is not walk up first come first serve like most restaurants. The hostess wanted us to wait 15 minutes instead of letting us sit in the bar area where there were tables available. Once sat the waitress is rude and took hour to take order. New team or better customer service training.  Update after an hour I found the waitress sitting in a booth instead of attending to customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlotte-3,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003

We order the appetizer sampler. I wasn't crazy about the Mozzarella sticks but the jack Daniels boneless chicken was yummy.
