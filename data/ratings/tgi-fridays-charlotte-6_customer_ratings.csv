60,Todd A.,"Charlotte, NC",52,26,24.0,1.0,2012-07-09,Really bad experience here.  Came here with a work group and the wait from order to delivery of our meals was easily over an hour.  One of our meals had a date dot which shows the freshness of the vegetables that was about the size of a price tag in in it (photo attached). My meal tasted a little like soap and we got a cup which had dishwasher grime that we scrapped off with our fingernail from the inside.  Our waitress was nice and attentive up until our order was in....but it just didn't make u for everything else.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlotte-6?start=40,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.0840000000000005

21,Roger E.,"Indian Trail, NC",2,25,,3.0,2012-10-12,"I have mixed feelings about this place. I think the service was Great, from the hostess with the extremely low cut shirt on (i'm not a jerk, it was very low, too low for her, and too low for my liking, she had horrific stretch marks all over her breasts, keep those things covered!), to the waitress, who's attitude was friendly. Both girls were very nice, especially the one with the low cut top on, which made up for the fact that I had to witness all of her ""Goodies"". I couldn't help but stare! The food was plentiful, but it wasn't good. The ""fall off the bone"" ribs weren't falling off the bone and they were badly burnt! I'm giving them 3 stars due to the service, service was a five, food was a Zero!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlotte-6?start=60,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284
58,Rob W.,"Charlotte, NC",10,100,963.0,1.0,2013-02-24,"Absolutely unacceptable service. It has been a very long time since i have actually gotten up and left a restaurant because of bad service, but let me tell you, it was the best thing that I did this evening. My family decided to take a trip to TGI Fridays because it has been a while since we have visited this location and we were craving the fried green beans with wasabi ranch. Our visit was on Saturday evening. We arrived around 8:40, actually got a front parking spot in front of the door, and had less than a five minute wait. So far so good, then we were seated and promptly entered the ""twilight zone"".  Our server came over after about 7 minutes, took our drink order and we took the opportunity to  order the fried green beans with wasabi ranch.  Now, after 8 minutes our fried green beans and wasabi ranch arrived, but we still have yet to receive our drinks. We had two waters and a sweet tea.  We were told that it would be a few minutes before the sweet tea was ready.  By now,  two tables have been seated a two top right behind us and a four top across from us. They were promptly greeted  by our server and they began their dining experience. We ordered a Jack Daniel's cheeseburger, the sizzling chicken and shrimp and a Friday's® House Salad (Romaine, red cabbage, grape tomato, cucumber, mixed cheese and focaccia croutons with choice of dressing and a hot garlic bread stick.) I have added the description as shown on the website and menu. Ours did not come with the bread stick.  When we asked the server, he stated that it did not come with one, we stated that the menu said it did.  After my wife finished the salad he obliged with 2 hot garlic bread sticks, but what was the point, the salad was already finished. So thirty minutes passed and each of the tables received their salads, and meals that came in after us, we felt we had been neglected enough. This is where I approached the front hostess stand, requested the manager, and let her know how this was just unacceptable.  The manager stated that it was just a few more minutes, and I let her know that my family had already left and was in the car.  As a courtesy, I let her know that I was willing to pay for the tea, salad and fried green beans, but we were not going to hang around any longer.  She insisted that we wait and have it boxed to go, but I declined, as it should have been presented as ordered in a timely manner at our table, not in a to go box.  (Just remember the food was still not even ready).  The manager said it was not necessary to pay, but this is just not acceptable at a dining establishment. I am getting really frustrated at the level of incompetence in businesses, and the lack of willingness to provide an effort to do very basic skills. Please take a moment and train the employees of the importance of serving others by understanding the menu and by taking care of the needs in a timely manner.  If one cannot handle more than 4 tables, then one may need a new job. I am pretty sure that by the other yelp reviews, I am not the only one who is NOT thinking TGI Friday! Just on a side note: Had I not stopped by the hostess stand and ask for the manager, the server would have never noticed we were gone?  Now that's sad!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlotte-6?start=40,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02
49,Candyce B.,"Charlotte, NC",320,767,878.0,3.0,2013-04-01,"I'd say this was a pretty solid visit to TGI Friday's. My friend and I stopped in Saturday night, it was pretty late when we got there and the hostess asked if we would mind sitting at the bar. We said that was no problem at all! The waitress greeted us immediately and said any of the waiters we saw could help us! Sweet!  We took a little bit of time to order, but ended up going with the wings with Caribbean Rum sauce and chose your own appetizer with crispy green beans, pot stickers and garlic Parmesan boneless wings.  The food arrived pretty quickly, but the sauces on our wings were wrong, but the waitress apologized and put another order in right away. The crispy green beans and pot stickers were hot and delicious. Once our second order of wings arrived we were good to go!  We both left full and happy. So I'd say again, overall a solid visit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlotte-6?start=40,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348

Then we waited,  and waited.  Apparently our section was being taken care of by a new server and she was not quite with the program as the waitress who ended up asking us if we had been waited on said. At any rate we ordered our food and were offered a free dessert per the manager who sent apologies with our waitress. I got the Jack Daniel's burger and it was really, really good. Cooked perfectly and served with pretty decent fries, I was a happy girl. My husband ordered the Jack Daniel's chicken with parmesan fries and broccoli and two huge chicken breasts (saved one for next day lunch). We did choose the brownie for dessert and it was good as well, and a nice offering to smooth over the rough start to service we had. It was a decent overall visit, but based on the experience as a whole, I think three stars is as high as I can go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlotte-6?start=60,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444
57,Jonathan S.,"Steele Creek, Charlotte, NC",1,1,1.0,1.0,2013-10-07,Alert... There is portion control now at TGI Fridays.  Burgers are portioned and shaped to look exactly like a frozen patty.  Also no rare-well done option.  Can only pick Pink or No Pink?!?! Is this a restaurant or fast food joint.   Also don't ask for any extra cheese..... They are out of 8 of the 10.   Order drinks over the phone before you arrive .... 15mins for a draft beer 20+ mins for cocktail.  Also watch out if you wear flip flops or open toe shoes.... Utensils and huge pieces of food under the table.  Stepped on a steak knife when I slid into the booth.  Waitress was a sweetheart wasn't her fault the restaurant is poorly managed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlotte-6?start=40,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212

Basically it's $10 per person and you choose one appetizer and stick with it.  We chose mozzarella sticks,boneless chicken and potstickers.  We were so full and could barely finish our second round.

The service was great with the two bartenders switching out who came to the table. The drinks were phenomenal - $3 martinis on Wednesday. And not just the plain old vodka and olive but fun drinks too - I had a chocolate martini and a pink pink Cosmo (which they put cotton candy in and fill from the shaker at your table). Sadly the food was only so so. The mozzarella sticks were great, the pot stickers and buffalo wings were nothing special and the potato skins are exactly what you get when you buy the TGI Fridays frozen loaded potato skins at the grocery store. While the experience was just ok the price was definitely worth a return visit especially now that we have narrowed down the appetizers we liked",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlotte-6?start=20,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38
43,Ryan H.,"Gastonia, NC",1,26,1.0,4.0,2015-03-16,"I have always enjoyed this place. Like most chain restaurants, they change their menu often.  The menu prices seem much higher than usual since the last menu change. They've also rid some of the combination deals you may be used to. Basically, if you haven't been here in awhile, be prepared to spend more money than you were used to.  However, I still enjoy the food here, although due to the prices, I can't dine here as often as I have in the past. I have also become vegetarian recently so it's hard to find dishes that suit us herbivores in my zip code.  That hasn't been a too much of a problem the two times I've been here since though. The first time, I ordered a salad with grilled chicken, asking to have it without the chicken. Although the waitress gave a funny look (which I'm used to by now), she was still very helpful, offering to add other veggies or black beans. They even gave me a side salad with it for only a dollar, which was nice. Some places act as if they've never heard of a vegetarian and panic when I ask that they just leave out the meat. Others scoff, and others even charge MORE to leave out meat!?!? This place has handled it well so far. The second time, I was very happy to see that they had a black bean burger on the menu and I was very pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Their smoothies are good too.  Every time I've come here (for years), the staff has been friendly.  It can be and feel a bit crowded at times, as they pack in as many tables and chairs as possible and you have to dodge them just to walk to and from your table (depending on where you're seated in the building as the tables to the right of the entrance are more crowded than the left side).  I've never had to wait forever for food. It's always been quick to average.  My girlfriend's daughter got a ""kid's"" chicken sandwich, which not only looked very delicious (for a dead chicken), but was large enough to even make me full if I had eaten it. It was only around $5.00 to boot. She loved it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlotte-6?start=20,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544

Just as I was about to leave a one-star rating they came back and comped the appetizers and sent us home with a free dessert.  Way to own up TGI Fridays!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlotte-6?start=20,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348

The unsweet tea was loaded with sugar. The pretzel appetizer was a frozen roll that was microwaved for couple of minutes. The sliders were so hard, my son lost his wiggly tooth and it actually made a knocking sound when it was dropped on the table. The water with lemon, however, was excellent. The kids meal hamburgers are sliders. My daughter  could  not eat her burnt slider so we asked for a regular  burger that came back burnt as well.

Tonight we had a wonderful waitress,  but ended up waiting almost a full hour after our steaks came out completely undercooked.  Mine came back the second time just fine but my husband's was still raw in the center.

A few years ago when I first moved to the area, while the service was good, the food was not prepared vey well. The last two times I've been in recently I can tell things have changed. I've sat at the bar both times and the bartenders are friendly. Both times I ordered the Cajun pasta without shrimp and it's so yummy, I came back within a week probably and had it twice because it was so yummy I had to get it again lol. The Barbados rum punch, while obviously not how they make it in Jamaica is very good. It's not very strong, nice and fruity which is how I like it. I'm glad the my sister pulled me in here one late nigh, because I had sworn off returning.

Then it took forever for our waters to arrive.  Shortly after receiving the 1 st order of apps I ended up with a medical emergency in which I passed out. Several customers came to my aid despite the manager being notified & being asked to call 911- in which she refused & told my friend to do it.  Thank you to those who assisted me Shockingly we had to wait for our bill in which we were charged fully even though we only had 1 serving each of an appetizer. I needed to leave since I was not feeling well. Not that I was looking for a free meal but I felt it in poor taste since we didn't have much at all - the servings were really small The fried pickles I ate were awful.

We had a medical emergency and I asked them to call 911 the manager told me no they will ask me questions you call them. During this they bring our second serving of loaded potato skins and garlic Parmesan wings. The wings were not very tasty they tasted like strong garlic and rubbery. The potato skins tasted burnt.

I told my server, who took them both away without any apology. My food was then brought back to me by another server who simply threw it all down in front of me and walked off. I ate that one round and after waiting what had to be no less than 20 minutes to see my server and to get a refill on my water, I asked for the check and to speak with the manager. My server returned with my check told me the manager would be over shortly to speak with me. I paid and waited to speak with a member of the managers staff. I waited a full 30 minutes and NO MANAGER EVER CAME OVER TO MY TABLE! When I asked my server again about speaking to a manager, I was told to please be patient and someone would get to me as soon as they could. This is not only unprofessional on part of the server, but also on part of the management staff. A complaint from a patron should be addressed immediately or at the very least the patron should be informed that their concerns are important and will be taken care of in a TIMELY MANNER. I waited another 30 minutes before finally leaving and deciding to right this review.

They were great. Food? RUN RUN RUN! First off-site our potato skins were burnt, and severally lacking. Harley any cheese, bacon, and no green onions. The ones you buy in a grocery store are actually better than what we had here.  Here's where it for really bad. I ordered their cajun shrimp and chicken pasta. It looked amazing, however the very first bite I must have apparently made an obvious fave because my husband instantly knew.  It honestly tasted like the ocean it was so fishy. I was really like eating shrimp in, an ocean sauce. I don't know if I can eat shrimp again for a long time it was honestly that bad.

24,J R.,"Rockville, MD",0,1,,1.0,2017-11-02,I don't know what us up with this place because they used to be really good. Wifey and i would get take out about once every month or two  since I like the Jack Daniels burger and wife likes the Jack Daniels chicken nuggets.  This is literally the third time this has happened. I ordered my usual burger with EXTRA JD on the side. This came as a regular cheeseburger with jack cheese no JD sauce on burger or on side and no bacon. Wife got her usual JD chicken nuggets which is usually a pretty good portion talking maybe 15 nuggets which is reasonable since they cost $11 dollars. However this time 8 lierally 8 for $11. What a deal right? Anyways they also seem to always forget the kids meal. Then when you ask them for it they get an attitude. Like i said we eat there once every month or two so for us tipping $6 on a $40 take out order that we enjoy is no big deal. I really wish i had asked for the tip back as the bar tender couldnt be bothered and i had to ask a server for help or at least give the tip to the waiter. So in summary if you eat here eat in and do not get take out. If you must get take out CHECK and double check the order before you leave. Also the manager in his green pastel shirt was 0 help and just ignored me when i tried to get his attention.

Succulent, check. Special, yep you guessed it, check.  I love a good BLT, and usually order one when I'm hungry but not starving.  Just looking for a little something to wet my beak not stuff my gullet.  What the visionaries behind the scenes at Friday's have achieved with this creation accomplishes both.  If you're looking for a sure thing, this is as sure as they come.  Don't believe, that's your choice.  Be unhappy, and believe what you want. I mean there are people who are still convinced the earth is flat.  The only reason for a lack of the 5th star is that service was not up to par with the standard I have come to expect from Friday's.  Since it was a busy Saturday night and they provided not only this delectable treat but unmatched conversation and atmosphere, I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.  Friday's keep up the good work, and rest easy tonight knowing that you're exceptional culinary work has opened up the mind of at least one royal patron to question everything they thought they knew about the 4 simple letters T.G.I.F.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlotte-6,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

They have a marvelous lime, passion fruit, strawberry and lemon tea that my husband had and I decided to drink a coconut water, with bubble tea drink, something like that. It was okay, but I wouldn't order it again.  My husband ordered a burger with a patty is fried Mac and cheese, you won't believe how delicious that thing was! I went with a special of bacon crusted barbecue ribs. It came with a side of fried, slaw and a whole rack of ribs for 12.99!!! Can you believe it? The French fries were so good , they had some seasoning that is so flavorful!!! Since I don't eat slaw my husband ate mine and said it was one of the best he's ever had.
