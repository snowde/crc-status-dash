61,Eric K.,"Charlotte, NC",119,593,1843.0,3.0,2012-01-19,"We visited TGI Friday's during our lunch break from work.  The place was pretty dead and we were promptly seated.  Normally, I would love a table by a lot of windows.  However, it was winter and it was almost as cold inside as it was outside.  If I wasn't afraid of spilling my lunch down my leather jacket and scarf, I would have worn both of them during my entire meal. Trying to eat a healthy, lightish lunch, I ordered a Grilled Chicken Cobb Salad because it sounded the best of all the salads.  It had an ""RPRP"" label next to it (Right Portion, Right Price) and was cheaper than the other salads, though, so I was afraid it was going to be a tiny salad and I'd still be hungry.  Thankfully, it was pretty huge and, therefore, filling.  I really enjoyed it and everything on it looked very fresh.   We only chose Friday's for lunch because I had a buy one get one free coupon.  Otherwise, I would have gone somewhere else because Friday's DOES NOT HAVE ANY LUNCH SPECIALS.  You heard me.  I think they're the only restaurant I've ever been to that does not have a differentiation between lunch and dinner options and prices.  Do I want to spend dinner prices at lunch?  Hell no. So while we had really good meals and great service for our lunch, dinner prices at lunchtime and a freezing cold dining room deserve the removal of two stars from this review.  Shame on Friday's for not offering lunch specials to its dining guests.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlotte?start=60,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005
42,Gary J.,"Rock Hill, SC",14,49,35.0,1.0,2012-03-19,"First off let me say this TGIF is gonna get the brunt of a couple of other TGIF visits I've had around the Charlotte area. I'd say i've had a couple of other visits to TGIF's in Charlotte and I don't recall them being a good experience. I kinda forgot that until we headed there on a whim and right away i remembered, ohhhh yea, this place is soooo loud. I'm not talking a little loud, I'm talking scream to place an order or ask your wife sitting next to you what the waiter said. Yep, that loud.  It took us about 15 minutes to get seated was what they had advised. The waiter was good and provided really good service (Once we could hear each other). It took another 30-45 minutes to get our food and then another 10-15 to get bill and checked out. Almost 2 hours is way to long for a meal, especially when it's impossible to have any sort of conversation with the others in your party.  So I believe over the years i've tried TGIF's 3 times or so and I'm pretty sure this will be the last time. Fool me once shame on you, fool my twice shame on me, fool me three times.......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlotte?start=80,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000005
41,Zach W.,"Huntingtown, MD",3,11,,1.0,2012-03-28,"This was quite honestly my worst experience ever at a TGI Fridays. It was a Saturday evening visit, and it was one of those days... First off, I've been to this Friday's before, and it was decent. This time, it went bad. Starting off, the atmosphere was awfully loud with a few drunks at the bar, @ 530?!? The food however started ok, and progressively got bad. We ordered two appetizers and our main courses. Apps were ok, not great, but our fried green beans were luke warm at best and our dip was ice cold. We got Ribs and Chicken, and the Ribs were tough and very meatless for the cost of the dish. The chicken was soggy, and tasteless. Our waiter, he was very attentive, but too attentive, coming back every 2-3 minutes asking if everything was ok. It seemed like he knew there was a bigger problem than we thought.. It was a disaster on date night, and very disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlotte?start=80,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000005

68,Grace S.,"Charlotte, NC",156,147,194.0,1.0,2012-09-03,"I went to this TGI Friday's on a Friday night, so I went in knowing it was going to be a pretty busy place.  I didn't think it was going to be as bad as I experienced. When my party walked in, it didn't seem like the five people at the hostess stand really wanted to greet us and were more concerned with mingling amongst themselves.  We told them we had a table of five, and one of the hostess' informed us it was going to be an hour wait.  Since we were hungry, we walked out of the restaurant, and one of the workers started waving us down because they had an opened table.  The sad part?  The opened table that was already clean was RIGHT BEHIND them.  Five people couldn't see an opened table clearly behind them?  Wow. After we sat down, we were greeted by a nice waitress, but her service was not all that great.  Through out the night, it was hard to find her or get her attention because she would pass by our table.  She also didn't seem as concerned when I informed her that my appletini glass had a lipstick mark on it.  My friend was able to spot it across from the round table we were sitting at, and she didn't even see it before she handed it to me.   The food was good, but took way too long to receive.  I think that we waited a good 30 minutes for our appetizers.  I don't even know how long we were waiting for our entree as I started getting cranky and moody like I always do when I'm hungry.

The service was good and the food was hot.  We asked what the drink specials were because we sat at the bar, and this night they were Long Island Ice Tea's....if you ask me there really is no other way to drink iced tea! But they were as expected, delicious! For appetizers we got the pot stickers and the spicy queso beef dip and for our meals we both tried the Jack Daniels Chicken Duo- which has grilled chicken on a skewer over jasmine rice and then sesame style chicken with a side of Jack Daniels glaze. YUM! The pot stickers were wonderful, I absolutely love the schezwan  dipping sauce! The spicy queso dip was good too...it's a little weird because it comes with topped with half a taco shell...but once you take that off it's full of yummy queso and jalapenos and spices for a nice kick!  The Chicken duo was delicious! I loved the grilled chicken especially which over the rice with the glaze was a perfect pairing.

The waitress was good and always on point with service.  As for the food I ordered the Jack Daniels ribs and shrimp. The shrimp were really good. As for the ribs they showed you shouldn't order ribs unless its a BBQ place. They were suppose to be baby backs but they were dry. Some parts of it were pretty good but a majority of it left your mouth dry wanting water. My wife ordered the steak, sadly a majority of that 10oz consisted of nothing but fat.  To top it off there was a huge party they sat next to us that ended up getting drunk off their ass. They were so damn loud and obnoxious you couldn't hear your own self think. I don't mind people being loud but c'mon you don't go to a restaurant and get blitzed. But from the way it seemed the manager and servers acted like its an everyday thing so what do I know I was just eating there.  Eating there made me realize why I never actually go eat there.

If you are looking for this place to be ""family-friendly"", than do not sit in the bar area or do not bring children there after 9pm. I frequent this particular TGIF's a lot, but I only sit in the bar area because I usually plan to only have drinks and appetizers and to enjoy the excitement of the bartenders and the numerous new people I meet there while in the bar.   I went with a friend on this particular visit to have a girls' night out, have some drinks and have fun! And boy did we definitely have some fun! We ordered the pretzels with the craft beer cheese dipping sauce and chips and salsa as our appetizers. The pretzel appetizer is my favorite and I always get it when I go to TGIF's, the craft beer cheese dipping sauce is very good and is mixed with green onions and bacon pieces. So to wash down the pretzels and chips and salsa we had to order tasty and refreshing drinks. TGIF's has a full service bar and the bar is fully stocked with the best alcohol and they have a wide variety of alcoholic beverages, from the traditional drinks to their signature ones. My friend had an Appletini and I had their signature drink, the Captain Morgan Island Rum Punch. The bartenders there on this night stuck their feet in these drinks, because they were AMAZING! The drinks were not watered down, I could taste the alcohol, and we got our money's worth. After sitting at the bar for awhile, we started to get hungry again, so we ordered an entree and both got the salmon with maison butter, mashed potatoes and the vegetable medley (zucchini, squash and red peppers). It did not take long for our food to come out, our food was hot and very tasty. We ate all of it!

""They don't have any more drafts.""  Fine, another bottle.  Still no entrees.  Five minutes later she returns with a bottle, puts it on the table, walks on.  We have empty plates and cups sitting on the edge of the table, and start looking around for her again.  No sign.   Finally, after flagging her down again and ASKING about our food, she goes into the back, then comes out and tells us that our food has been delivered to another table, and would we like the kitchen to start plates for us to eat in or take-out.   Blank stare.   I asked if the kitchen almost had ours ready since there was a mix-up.  No, she says, she has to tell them if we are taking it out. I ask ""What did the manager on duty say?""  She said ""He's in the kitchen.""  Blood begins to boil: ""We will Not be eating in OR take-out, please just give us our check.""  Comes back a few minutes later, bill is $49+ and she walks off.  I look over the ticket: double charged for drinks, charged for draft brews that apparently didn't even exist, and No response from the manager.   I ask the nearest server if she could could kindly summon the manager for me.  He was out in less than a minute, very courteous, and asks what is wrong.  I explain, in this much detail, what had happened.  He informs me that he has no knowledge of any misdirected food NOR has he taken anything off our ticket.  He then took the ticket and cleared it out except for the two bottles of re-bottled draft.  I left a minimal gratuity based on charged beverages alone; I hate being lied to. Will not be returning to this location. We MAY try another franchise, but with so many other restaurants that actually TRY, why should I bother?  The chain as a whole has lowered standards too much to be taken seriously as a restaurant.  They are pretty much a bar with extra tables nowadays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlotte?start=40,2.16,2.16,2.16,1.124,2.16

We were seated immediately, however our server was not a good one. I believe his name is Chris... He took our drink order and didn't ask if we wanted any apps or wanted to put in any orders. Once we got it drinks, it took him a while to come back to take the order. He never came to check on us once we got our food or asked if anybody wanted to order another drink. Before he brought the checks I asked for 2 of the Tennessee whiskey cakes. He then brought the checks and didn't add the cakes in. My total was $19.52, so I paid with a $20 and we were all going to leave a tip collectivity. I was the only person that paid cash. When he returned to the table, he brung everyone else their cards back, kept my change and receipt, and didn't return with my cake. He said y'all have a good night. I then asked him where my cake was because at that point I wasn't worried about the change. He says ""oh, damn... I didn't put it in. You still want it?"" DUH! That was the purpose of me telling you I wanted it! He put the order in, brung the cakes, then says y'all have a good night. I'm thinking that because he had such horrible service, the cakes were free because he didn't bring a check. He watched us get up and leave out.

33,Tessa S.,"Charlotte, NC",0,1,,1.0,2016-08-06,"I went to this location last night and had the worst restaurant experience ever. The hostess told us that the wait would be twenty minutes, and after waiting that long she brought us to our table, dropped the menus on the table, and walked away without saying a word (a foreshadowing to how awful the rest of our experience would be). Numerous waiters and waitresses served the tables surrounding us without even giving a glance at us. We waited fifteen minutes, watching server after server pass us as if we were invisible.  My boyfriend, whom I was with at the time, is an experienced waiter himself and was completely appalled by the service. After waiting the fifteen minutes he decided to ask the hostess about our lack of service. She was not apologetic in the slightest, she said she would get us drinks and then walked away right after. She did not only fail to apologize but she failed to take any proactive action at all and find our waitress.  Again, we waited fifteen more minutes being completely ignored.  At this point we were both starving and fed up, so my boyfriend asked to talk to the manager. The manager made his way over to our table and asked what the problem was. We explained the situation of not being helped by a server in the long amount of time we had been seated, to which the manager had the audacity to point to our drinks and question us how we had gotten those, as if we were lying. We explained how we had had to go to the hostess and request help and she had gotten the drinks. The manager did not utter one apology, he turned to a waitress helping the table next to us (who had walked past us at least a dozen times) and asked if she could help us. She claimed she had not seen us and the manager walked away without saying another word. The waitress did not apology either, she only proceed to tell us that we could not share an appetizer or we would be charged for two.  No one in the entire restaurant apologized to us for our experience, or tried to make it right in the slightest. Instead they over-charged us, ignored us, and created such a hostile atmosphere that made us never want to come back.

My biggest issue was with the service we received from Staci. Now for the record I was a server/bartender and manager of a restaurant for over 4 years. There was now greeting at all. Like hi my name is Staci what can I get you to drink. Instead we got a what do you want to drink. I had the endless appetizer and my fiancé had the flat iron steak. The appetizers for one took forever to come out of the kitchen and this did not seem to be tho kitchens fault as the food was warm at this point and that's due to it sitting in a window for longer than it should (again I would know managed a restaurant for 4+ years). Every time she would ask what I would like next for my endless appetizer it came out as follows ""what do you want next"". She never once asked us how the meal tasted or checked in with us. The only time our server ever stopped at the table was to drop something we asked for off or when we ordered, no other times. The other issues is neither her nor any other server, bus boy, manager no one else asked if everything was ok either. One of my biggest issues was no one taking the plates we were done with out of our way. I had 3 app plates and my fiancé plate were all sitting on our table even when we left. My fiancé had finished his meal about 15-20 mins before my final appetizer came out and still no one too the plate even though we put the napkins and everything overtop of the plate.

I have frequented this location so this review of staff is based on 10+ visits. The kitchen tonight wasn't executing on quality. Not only was my medium steak well done it was cut numerous times and overly drenched in sauce. My husband had to slice his own chicken and peppers in the pasta which was plopped on top of a bed of noodles and sauce when it arrived at our table... Minus 1.5 stars for that. They must have ran out of glasses so our fountain beverages came out in bar glasses that weren't clean minus .5 star. The floor looked as if a 5 year old took to it...food, sticky substances you name it so .5 of a star loss.

There we're two separate families with young children out of control.  The majority of people seems to know each other and we're having conversations across the whole bar.   There was a person at the bar who was a regular and - without judging - apparently has a mental disorder.   She was arguing with the staff over her ""to go"" order and eventually tried to leave without paying.  This caused a major scene.   Everyone in the restaurant saw the whole situation.   Ok.  So, this was just one day.  But according to the bartender, it's something that happens frequently.   You can judge for yourself.  But with half-dozen other chains nearby, I'm skipping this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlotte,1.68,1.68,1.68,1.3160000000000003,1.6800000000000002

Don't just treat people anyway because you're busy learn how to work under pressure. This place was packed like every table was taken people were waiting inside and outside. The food was nasty. The chicken was dry, the broccoli was stale and they forgot what I asked for and paid for. I won't be returning to this location due to bad service and I don't like the food. I had to throw it away.

18,Kristin K.,"Clayton, NC",0,17,,2.0,2017-03-25,Pretty annoyed that a restaurant that claims to be family oriented but has no changing table in the bathroom. There is plenty of room in the handicapped bathroom to put in a changing table. There is also not enough room on the counter because the sinks take up every bit of room. I think it should be a law that restaurants have baby changing tables in every bathroom; men's and women's. I honestly don't want to patronize a restaurant that doesn't meet my needs. I love the food at TGI Friday's but it's not worth the inconvenience. My choice is change the baby in the car or on the table.

77,Aurora M.,"Mineral Springs, Charlotte, NC",133,1,,1.0,2017-06-02,"Never have I ever received such HORRIBLE, and that's being quite generous, service in an establishment before today. Arrived at TGI FRIDAYS tonight and was seated immediately. Never did anyone ask us about drinks or anything for the first 10 minutes. We place food and drink order with our no name waitress - she clearly didn't feel like greeting us when she stumbled across our table. Long story short - we waited for an additional 50-60 minutes before we were ever talked to again. Never saw our waitress again until after our food was brought out by another server and I asked for more sauce  (my food looked like it was sitting in grease and I could not stomach it). Also, we ordered an appetizer...never got it. I had to tell the server after we had our food, when she decided to grace us with her presence for only the second time, that we never received our appetizer. She looked like ""well that's too bad"", but her response was ""oh, sorry about that"" and she walked away. So I'm waiting for my pasta sauce for another 5-6 minutes and then she brings me another water - no sauce. I'm literally ready to leave at this point. I have no desire to sit here and receive this service anymore. Finally, halfway through eating....here comes a plate of potato skins that we ordered an hour and a half ago...as an appetizer. We asked the server for the bill and I be damned if she didn't toss it on the table. I need Friday's to do better. I will not be returning. The Manager did just come by and asked us how everything was and we couldn't get it out of our mouths fast enough that we just had the most horrible experience.

We were sat in an area where there were no tvs. So I had to squint from afar. Service was decent. I don't think I saw my waitress crack a smile. She wasn't rude, just seemed overwhelmed. Food was about the same quality as their frozen options in the store. I thought my skins were decent. What I make at home is much better.

My boyfriend and I placed an online order on a late Thursday night (it was around 10:15pm). He ordered the buffalo wingman's burger without the tomato and I ordered the Jack Daniel's chicken sandwich -- No substitutions, except that he did not want tomatoes in his burger. Once we placed the order, we were instructed that it'd be ready for pickup in the next 20 minutes. When we arrived in approximately 20 minutes, we ended up waiting for an additional 15 minutes. Mind you, it was a Thursday night, so it wasn't that crowded. We left once we got our food and drove about 10 minutes home. We settled in and were about to enjoy our food, but then realized that his buffalo wingman's burger did not have buffalo wings....instead, his beef patty was topped with a chicken patty (Please refer to the pictures). Sorry, but how could you get a simple order so wrong??? So we ended up driving back to the restaurant. It took about 15 minutes for them to make a new burger and we left, again. When we got back to our place, he had a tomato in his burger, although he had asked for it to be left out. And I didn't get a chance to inspect my food closely the first time, but I realized too late that the Cajun onions in my chicken sandwich were nowhere to be found.

Tonight I showed up and sat myself in the bar area, though not at the proper location apparently (the server Erin got an attitude about us seating ourselves, even though there was no host or hostess present).  After almost 10 minutes we finally got drinks, and she sent the manager over without our requesting him to try and ""understand why we seated ourselves."" (I assume that's what the server said) I informed him about the situation with the host stand both evenings, and then he apologized and took our food order.  During the small meal, the server never stopped at the table. She would only ask ""you doing okay"" as she was walking quickly by. She then came to our table when the meal was almost over and asked if we were done. As we said no, we were still working on the food, she tried to pull the plate away. I then informed her again that we were not done but we would definitely be needing our check.  She walked away and actually hollered loudly to the manager and told him to take us our check while she disappeared into the back.  The manager came over and apologized again, letting us know that she should not be acting that way. Additionally, another server came over and apologized to us, saying she saw the horrid service and felt bad that we had to experience that.  The manager also let us know that he was working on getting the restaurant up to the standard it should be, so I truly hope he evaluates Erin and helps her get better or move on to other opportunities outside TGIFriday's.
