Then they called the police who came in asking me whether or not I was going to pay my bill.  What about the water and the knife!!!  I filed a complaint on the website and received a call back from a man in guest relations who stated they don't have any control over the contracted security they hire.  They also claimed that the incident occurred between 2 patrons so their policy is to just ask both of them to leave.  So your policy is if someone comes into your place of business, gets harassed, and assaulted, oh well, both of you get the hell out.  That's BULLSHIT!  I'm telling everyone I know to never go there again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago?start=180,2.96,2.96,2.96,1.7320000000000002,2.96

186,Maria L.,"Chicago, IL",2,31,2.0,1.0,2013-05-16,"Just went there for my birthday yesterday... The food was awful. I ordered the Jack Daniels chicken... It's a simple meal that I purchase at every TGIF: Two grilled chicken breasts with two sides -- I chose broccoli and mashed potatoes for my sides.  One of my chicken breasts was undercooked and tasted like a rubber ball. The broccoli was not steamed at all. In fact, I believe they dipped it in hot water for 30 seconds to give the allusion that they were steamed. The only things that were OK on my plate were the mashed potatoes and one chicken breast... I was so disappointed.  Not to mention the waitress and her assistant (a new hire) completely forgot about me. Funny thing is, the seasoned server didn't ask me if I wanted a refill or if anything was ok at all, but strolled by my table about an hour after I received my food and said ""Sweety, I just wanted to let you know I didn't forget about you."" Talk about a dead giveaway. Drive the extra 15 miles to the TGI Friday's near Midway or find another restaurant downtown.

With the slumping economy in these chain restaurants, they are offering bargain prices for meals not often seen. I was a bit skeptical at first, but what can you ask for 10 dollars. I left with a smile. It was not too busy on a weekend for lunch. They easily squeezed my wife, a child in a stroller, and me in a table. The waitress was super nice and took our orders quickly. I picked the fried mozerrela which was small planks of fried cheese with marinara sauce. No complaints here, there was more than 6 of these small patties and was the perfect appetizer to share. My wife got the chicken florentine flat bread which was cooked well and perfectly seasoned. My entree was the Bruschetta Chicken Pasta with slices of tomato, cheese, and chicken. The chicken was tender and not too overseasoned. There was a strong grill flavor to the chicken but it went well with the pasta. I can honestly say that I was pleased to pay 10 dollars for this meal which is why 4 stars for a chain restaurant.

We waited about 30 minutes to finally get our entrees, we both got the sizzling chicken, but mine was with cheese and his was with shrimp, we soon discovered that the cheese itself was actually American cheese, which is not something I remember having on it since it was both of our favorite dishes from the restaurant. It was our first time to the city restaurant, and it was very disappointing. To come into the city and have subpar food and subpar service was very irritating. Now back to our food, his chicken was mostly burnt on the bottom, his shrimp was bland, it sat out too long in the window, the onions and green peppers were over cooked, mine was the same experience but without the shrimp. They have an obnoxious amount of servers, I mean I understand for it being a game day, but it is also before holiday and most people are going to be out of town.

70,Tyler G.,"River Grove, IL",0,1,,5.0,2014-05-01,"My girlfriend and I were walking around the Water Tower Place and we were starving to get a bite to eat. Of course there are probably many well-known places to eat around the Water Tower, but we were craving for some Hamburgers and we both knew that T.G.I Fridays has the Jack Daniels Burger. As soon as we entered T.G.I Fridays the hostess greeted us and she showed us to our seats. As we were passing through the seats, I couldn't keep my eyes off the decoration around me. I saw a long canoe on the ceiling, which I was at awe for that it, was very big. One of the decorations that specially caught my eye was a medium size statue of the Blues Brothers, which I enjoy seeing their signature dance time to time. Like I said there are many things to look at on the walls and everything is nicely lighted and everything is clean. The restaurant gives a good relaxed vibe and with the great service that makes it worthwhile to eat here.  When we sat at our table, we were greeted with a waiter I probably wont ever forget. He looked like Ray Liotta with a personality of a modern Elvis. He starts off with saying his name and then he asked us what we wanted to drink, so we told him we want water. He was nice and patient as we were looked at all the delicious foods and forgot why we even came here.  After we were given a generous amount of time to look at the menu, we decided to get 2 burgers and 3 appetizers.   The three appetizers that we got were called Thai Pork Taco, AHI Tuna Nacho, and the Cornbeef and Swiss Slider. The Thai Pork Tacos look like any ordinary taco with pork, onions, cilantro, and the corn tortilla, but what made it different was the sweet Thai sauce on the taco. The taco was good and filled with pork, but I felt that it had too much cilantro in it. The next appetizer was the AHI Tuna Nacho, which had the strip of tuna on a nacho chip with avocado, Sriracha sauce, and wasabi mayonnaise. The chips were good especially with the tuna strips and the generous portion of avocado that can cancel out the Sriracha sauce and the wasabi mayonnaise if you want. Lastly from the appetizers were the Cornbeef and Swiss Slider that happen to be fairly packed with the cornbeef. The Swiss was melted on the cornbeef and had pickles and onions on it. Out of all the appetizers, my favorite was the CornBeef and Swiss Slider since it was the closest thing to my soon to come double-stacked burger.   The two burgers we got are called the Jack Daniel's Burger and the All-American Stacked Burger. I had the All-American Stacked Burger, while my girlfriend had the Jack Daniel's Burger. The All-American is a big burger that consists of lettuce, tomatoes, onion, bacon, thousand-island sauce, cheddar cheese, and two beef patties. The burger was tall enough that it needed a long toothpick to stabilize it. The burger itself was delicious with all kinds of juices from the thousand island and the patties itself was dripping down my hand. The Jack Daniels is personally on of my favorite burgers since it had the sweet-alcoholic hint from the Jack Daniels sauce. The sauce comes in a cup so you can pour as much as you desire on the burger or you can dip your fries in it. The Jack Daniels has bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, provolone cheese, and a meaty patty. The Jack Daniels sauce is what makes the burger, so I bet you can ask for some and not miss out on the burger itself. Over all T.G.I Fridays near the Water Tower gets a 5/5 for their great restaurant service devoted to the customers experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago?start=140,2.4,2.4,2.4,1.9720000000000002,2.4

Our server took our drink orders and then came back a half hour later with half of our drinks and told us she had spilled the whole tray. I don't know if she was new, but if she was then she shouldn't have been assigned to a big party. I actually felt bad for her. When the food finally came out, it wasn't even worth the wait. My steak was cold, the salad tasted like paper and the portions were small. The manager didn't even come out to apologize for the long wait. There was no reason it should have taken that long.

163,Sharon C.,"Chicago, IL",426,382,29.0,3.0,2014-07-15,"I was here with a group of five other people for the unlimited appetizers deal, which is, obviously, an incredible amount of food for $10, especially because we shared all of our appetizers and got three rounds of each. In case you have less than six people, here are the things we got, in order of how much I liked them:  1. Loaded potato skins. Always the loaded potato skins, which I crave when I can't get, and which I have resorted to buying frozen from Costco in desperate times. These were crunchy, with generous amounts of cheese and an acceptable, if not as generous, sprinkling of fresh bacon. Definitely the favorite dish we got.  2. Bruschetta. One of the things we were on the fence about ordering, but it ended up being a fantastic choice (for those of us who liked tomatoes... so not me). It was the perfect blend of sweet and salty, and really refreshing, especially against the other, heavier things we ordered.  3. Mozzarella sticks. Arrived at the table at the perfect temperature - almost nothing more disgusting than lukewarm mozzarella sticks - and the perfect proportions of coating to cheese.  4. Boneless buffalo wings. I'm not a fan of boneless buffalo wings in general, but these were particularly one-dimensional and featured a very, very thick coating of batter with a small piece of meat.  5. Potstickers. Generic, definitely not something we would have ordered if we had had fewer people. The sauce was the only part of this appetizer that was interesting or different. Would not recommend.  6. Spinach dip. Definitely not worth ordering, it's a huge portion of spinach dip paired with a small serving of chips. The dip was bland and insufficiently creamy, with a weird, buttery aftertaste. Would not recommend.  We also ordered a short glass of Angry Orchard and one of 312, both on tap. Our waitress initially brought us two glasses of Angry Orchard, but she was quick to correct her mistake once we pointed it out.  Service overall, however, was lacking. I understand that, since the bill was so small, she wasn't anticipating much of a tip, but she dropped by our table to check on us only once, mumbling something that only one person heard, and we  only saw her three times more - twice when she asked if we wanted more food (yes), and once when we asked her for the check. Our food was brought out by other people, and she never actually brought us our check. At least ten minutes after we asked, another girl saw us waiting, asked if we needed our check, and brought it to us within minutes.  I'm going to give this experience three stars because service was pretty much nonexistent and because of the wait times, which were far too long considering there weren't that many people in the restaurant. This deal, however, is definitely worth going in for - and it ends August 24!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago?start=40,2.04,2.04,2.04,1.9640000000000002,2.04

It took over 30 mins for our food to come. When I got my food I was missing mozzarella sticks. I choose from the 2 for $12. I asked the server where they were and he goes ""I don't know where they are. I can check on them if you still want them."" OFCOURSE I WANT THEM.

111,Shaneika B.,"Chicago, IL",136,4,,1.0,2014-08-29,"I love TGIF resturaunt every since I was younger, it was always a treat to dine here. Recently I dined in with my little sister as a going away to college lunch. Had a great time and great service. I had such great service i deceided to return a week later 8/25/14 with my roomate. It started with our waitress we were seated and that pretty much all we saw of her. We requested to have the unlimited appetizers 1st and becuase she for got to put the order in and we waited so long, she brings out 4 platters instead of 2 at one time of the appetizers. The table was cluttered and it she never came to remove any of our used plates and glasses, i had to flag down other waiters to assist my table. When she saw me speaking with other waiters she would YELL from across the room that she was coming to assist me. After I had already been helped. My water refills were all done by waiters I had to flag down. Also by the time the entree came, we were full off appetizers so we asked for a TO-GO box. instead she brings out more appetizers. Before I could say anything the waitress turns to me and says: ""You cant take those appetizers home, we will have to call the police if you try to leave with them and we have people watching!"" I was extremely offended!! 1st they are $10 appetizers and i'm sure the police isn't making arrests over something this petty as taking 3-4 potstickers home in our order. In my previous visit the week before, we had a few of our appetizers left and were able to take them home. My point to her was, if she would have brought them out ON TIME, instead of trying to DOUBLE UP and bring out TWICE as MANY at 1 time, we wouldnt have needed to take any home. So we left our TABLE w/4 platters of FRESH APPETIZERS LEFTOVER!!...It seemes like such a terrible waste. Overall, I dont appreciate being told, the police woould be called on me if I took a cheestick or any other appetizer out of their resturaunt, that I essentially PAID for.OVERALL TERRIBLE SERVICE!

My coworkers and I have been going here just about every week for the past few months because it is steps away from work and the lunch special. We only have a 45 minute lunch break so the location is very convenient. Over time we got used to the slow service and just dealt with it and were usually late getting back because we could not be served and eat in 40 minutes apparently. We would mostly order soup and salad, rarely entrees because of time constraints, and always sat at or by the bar. This particular time it was taking more time than usual to get our food after we ordered a little bit before 12:30. Lunch break ends at 1:00. We started paying our bill around 12:55 because we were trying to save time after we ate and not have to worry about it. Some people got to pay, some people didn't because the bartender walked away. At 1:00 we had to tell the kitchen staff, the bartender wasn't at the bar, to please just box up our food to go because we're already late. This was 5 lunch special orders, mix of soups and salads and 1 chicken tenders. This is Friday's, I don't think the chefs were growing their own lettuce back there or making the soup of the day specially for individuals. The place was not busy at all. It appeared that there was about one employee per every two customers there. People that sat at the bar after us received their food before us. At 1:05, the bartender gave us 2 large bags with our to go food, apologized to us, and we left. We were shocked that the manager didn't apologize, we were not offered anything, and since we all had already paid to save time there was no discount. When we all got back to the office to pass out our food, of course the chicken tenders were missing and a salad was missing. I called the manager and explained the situation and he kept referring to our pick up order. No, this was dine in. He proceeded to tell me that he has my food ready for pick up.  He refused to send somebody over to drop it off after I asked. I had to leave work again to pick it up, no apology, nothing.

We traveled from Hyde Park to near north side, just for TGIFriday's. Our server Moses was terrible. He rarely came to our table which made a lunch, that should've been closer to an hour, stretch into three hours-mostly waiting for him to take our order. We sat dow at 3p and couldn't leave until 6:15p. We also had to track him down for the bill.  Service: Moses would never come to our table, rather he would come in the vacinity and we had to actually call him over by name.  Again, it was five of us. Moses never explained the endless appetizer deal that wasn't on the menu when we asked about it. A friend at the table, who knew what the deal was, had to do his job and help the rest of us.  Once we ordered, Moses only gave us three plates for our appetizers and never brought us napkins the entire time and never brought the rest of our plates. Two of use had to eat using the appetizer dishes. Also he only came to remove appetizer dishes once. So we had to start putting our empty drink glasses, empty appetizer plates on an empty table as he would bring a few more items on the half hour. We didn't have any more room at the table. My friend's were never able to get a refill on their pop in the entire three hours. I do not eat pork and would get sick if I did. I mentioned that I didn't eat pork when I was ordering my appetizer so he could tell me which ones had pork. I came to enjoy a Jack Daniels burger with no bacon/onion, an appetizer, and a dessert. An hour after ordering, he shows up with a dbl cheese burger full of bacon and proceeds to argue that I ordered this bacon burger and tried to shove it in my face because he didn't want to admit he was wrong. Who does that? He took no responsibility, gave no apology, and his customer service skills were offensive.  I unfortunately, had to cancel my order because I didn't have another hour to wait for him to get it wrong again and our friend's valet time was expiring after dealing with this nonsense.  I spoke to manager, Johnny, who didn't introduce himself nor wear a nametag. We had to get his name from another employee. I informed him of how our service was not good and how I came to enjoy a JD burger and had a bacon burger shoved in my face and the server tell me it would be a ""long time"" before I get my correct order. The manager did not take responsibility nor ownership of his server's poor service, and gave no apology. All he said was, ""I don't think I can get your order out to you faster."" I canceled my order and didn't order anything else. I expect better from TGI Friday's, especially since the manager claimed the Erie St location as the flagship.  During our visit we also had to deal with gnats flying around.

He gave drink recommendations and was just so pleasant. I'm a server so I think I pay extra close attention to the people who are my servers and he was just great!!!  We had the spinach flatbread and garlic parm buffalo wings for an appetizer (1/2 price apps if you sit in the bar area). Both were great. Then we both got the ribeye with lobster tail and it was all delicious! So much food omg! We got the broccoli and the mashed potatoes for our sides. Get the mashed potatoes!!! You'll thank me. I don't even like mashed potatoes and these were awesome. For dessert we had the Oreo madness. So good! For drinks my boyfriend got a house Long Island iced tea and then a blackberry Long Island. I had the berry mojito (SOOO GOOD!!!) and the Barbados rum punch. That was good but I wanted something a little stronger. It took a while for us to get our drinks but whatever that can't be avoided sometimes.  Everything was soooo good! Sometimes I feel like it can be a hit or a miss with chain restaurants.

The head hostess at this Chicago location, I believe her name is Angela, is ALWAYS very welcoming and accommodating. THE BEST server here is Mireya! She is ALWAYS professional, attentive and friendly and the reason why I return when I'm in the area.

106,Anthony A.,"Chicago, IL",1,4,,1.0,2015-06-06,"Late night around 10:30 on a Saturday night. Place was not that busy. Walked in and there was a line because the hostess with an attitude was explaining to a couple first of all that they needed I.d. and  couldn't sit upstairs because they had a kid. I understand policy but never am able to accept attitude, rudeness in a customer service business. Next comes our turn...table for 3 possibly in the 3 empty booths in front of us. Sorry have to wait because server cannot handle more than one table in that section!? Get seated at table, server Sarahson who obviously could care less about wether we have an enjoyable experience takes our order. The plates then proceed to come out at different times from entree first to appetizer(dried up old potato skins) to my entree and then proceed to wait for the third entree which takes forever. At this point we cancel the third order, which our server could care less once more. I tell the rest of my party to head home because obviously at this point she was taking forever to bring my check. Never one apology! Ask who the manager is... She gives the name but per restaurant policy is not able to write it down, I need to walk outside the restaurant and write it down myself.  I have been a neighbor and patron of this TGI for over 10+ years. Their service and quality of food has dropped exponentially over the years. How these businesses with subpar service and food continue to stay in business continues to baffle me, but I guess we support the behavior. I gave 1 star for the fact that this evening was the first time in my history that I did not give a tip of some sort. For that reason TGI should be given some recognition for that historic event.

88,Jorge M.,"Cicero, IL",1,1,1.0,2.0,2015-10-18,"We love going to Friday's but yesterday was just an unpleasant visit. The waiter was nice and started us off with water, gave us some time to look through the menu. Everything was going fine, we ordered some appetizers and drinks. Once our appetizers arrived though, that's  where it went down hill, they hadn't brought us any plates or silverware, were we expected to eat these appetizers with our hands or what? So we waited to see if maybe our waiter would pass by, nothing not even the other employees that were just walking around, yeah it was a bit busy but come on like 4 different employees passed by and didn't even look to see that we were annoyed, then we see everyone standing at the computer where the waiter/waitress puts in the order talking  and then my partner had to put his hand up to at least get one of their attentions, he even had to waive just to catch someone's eye until one of the ladies looked and at first she had on this look like we had bothered her by raising our hand, we wouldn't be raising our hand if at least our waiter or any employee was attentive to the guest which I'm sure is the priority right? So then she had the host come to our table to see what was wrong and told him we needed silverware and plates, he brought us the silverware still no plates, then we just decided to eat. The drinks also took a while to arrive I'm not sure if they only had one bartender that night or the drink took a while to make but we had to wait on them too. I also work in the restaurant business and having to have the guest waiting for something or not following up on their table is a big no-no for us. Other than that the food and drinks were good, it was just the service that kind of tanked, and yeah it was a bit busy but when you have 4 or 5 employees running or standing around talking and the guest having to raise their hand to get their attention makes you wonder if the guest is their first priority or not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago?start=100,2.08,2.39,2.39,1.768,2.2660000000000005

I, personally, do not enjoy this particular restaurant; but I will attend maybe once every other year if a close friend insists. On February 25, 2016 (around 9pm), however, my father was extremely excited to spend his birthday evening here with his family. Worst birthday experience thus far. From the moment we stepped in the door , we were not impressed as the host just leaned on the wall barely greeting us. Then we had the privilege to sit at a booth next to a dirty table, that hadn't even attempted to be cleaned until my father spoke up on it 45 minutes into our dining time. Even then, it was only partially picked up with more to come its way later on. Unfortunately, for us there was only one waitress in our entire section and she wasn't particularly ecstatic about serving. To try and shorten what could go on for lengths, my father spoke with the manager about his dissatisfaction which continued with long waits for food, lack of service alertness, incorrect orders, unclean restrooms and dining area, and not so great meals. After being asked to be spoken with a second time, the manager never showed her face and did not even attempt to provide concern for such grievances. To top things off, my sister and I each had one of the chicken selections, and I can't help but to think that our aching stomachs are a result of the food.

From the moment of entry into the restaurant and being immediately asked for a photo ID, prior to even receiving a greeting was off putting. To which then the 'hostesses' debated about where to seat us, after pointing at us and saying 'wait over there'... Two other parties entered the restaurant and were greeted, but not initially asked to show IDs, I looked shocked at which point one of the hostesses asked for IDs, and proceeded to seat one of those parties before seating us... At that point I felt it necessary to speak with a manager... 'Q' finally comes and asks who needs a manager, I politely explain what had transpired since we entered the restaurant. She apologized and asked if we still wanted to dine and we said yes. She seated us herself and apologized again... A moment later the waiter Von'e approached the table welcomed us and asked about drinks. I asked a question about the drinks menu and she responded quite negatively with 'she doesn't know, she doesn't drink' so at that point we just ordered waters and our food. Our food comes, brought by another worker who was quite pleasant THANK YOU and even grabbed us utensils, that hadn't been provided by Von'e. So from the hostesses to the waiter no one seemed happy to be there let alone working with a 'happy to help' attitude. Their dispositions were quite unpleasant to be working in customer service.

26,Adam M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,20,,1.0,2016-10-05,"Short: They made my girlfriend wait outside after 11pm in the cold while I placed a to go order after they refused to seat us due to her not having an ID at the time (left at hotel), while simultaneously seating families with younger children (ranging from 5-15 years old) expressing that their policy disallowed patrons under age 21 (my girlfriend is well over that age) into their establishment late-night, but minors were allowed if accompanied by an adults.  Troubles did not stop here.. read on if desired: I frequent Chicago often and allow me to make the following clear, for anyone wondering: THIS IS NOT, I REPEAT NOT, A CHICAGO FOODIE DESTINATION.  DO NOT THINK FOR A SINGLE SECOND THAT YOU WILL BE MET WITH ANY EXPERIENCE THAT REFLECTS THE PEOPLE/FOOD OF CHICAGO. Now that we have that settled, onto the actual review.. which I am really only taking the time to write as it is a direct safety concern in regards to their policies, but more importantly, the common sense of genuine morality and concern for others. Anyone who knows Chicago, and for those that don't, most places tend to close relatively early in the city.  Food options become pretty sparse, especially for a dine-in experience, once you get toward midnight as most kitchens are closed if the establishment is even open at all.  On this short trip to Chicago, after a very busy and tiring day, my girlfriend and I were starving and with little options late one evening we remembered that this particular location happened to be very close to our hotel, which was directly on the Magnificent Mile.  We walked over and once inside we were immediately met with rude employees, however, undeterred we asked for a table for two.  They asked for our IDs as protocol, which was no issue whatsoever, however because it was so late my girlfriend had not taken her wallet with her from the hotel, so as a result she had nothing to provide to them.  Though very well over age 21, we do both young, so I wasn't very bothered that we were basically turned away and we opted to retrieve her ID from the hotel and return. During our walk back we decided to hit a donut shop to bring some late night goodies back to the hotel for after our meal that we were aiming to return to, but then we had the brilliant idea of calling and ordering our meal to go from TGI Friday's seeing as the ONLY edible (and delicious, might I add) item we have ever eaten that is even remotely worth ordering off their menu is the Jack Daniel's Chicken.  I called and was told over the phone that to go orders can only be placed at the bar inside.. at this point we were pretty fed up with the fact that no matter what we would do they just didn't want us to eat their chicken, but now stubbornly determined we decided to go back over to the location, order in person for pick up, which we did.  As we approached the door we were denied entry due to her not having an ID, but thought nothing of it until they continued to deny her entry even though we were placing a to go order.  She was made to wait outside as I went to the bar to order and I was planning to step outside to keep my girlfriend comfortable in the cold while the food was being made.  After sitting at the bar it took over 10 minutes for one of the 3 servers walking around to finally approach me for my order.  I ordered two of the Jack Daniel's chicken strip appetizer and only after waiting for 15 minutes did the waiter express that he mis-inputted my order and that I was being made two Jack Daniels chicken breast entree instead - I express that was not what I ordered and the waiter said ""well, I already closed the order and the kitchen is already making it.""  I was pretty livid, but placidly said with a smile on my face, ""that's a shame then, you better tell the kitchen to start making what I ordered.."" he then sent me a manager who was actually very nice and helpful and remedied the situation without question/issue immediately.  I proceeded to now go outside where my girlfriend was waiting and was told that if I left the restaurant then my ordered would be immediately canceled in the kitchen, but I would be forced to pay and would not get my food.  Wtf? At this point I had had enough and sought out the manager who was helpful/kind.  I explained the situation and how much of a safety concern it was to force a paying patron to stand outside in the cold alone late at night, but most pressingly the fact that there were kids ranging from 5-15 years old sitting with their parents enjoying a (probably disgusting, unless it was the JDC) meal.  His mental/moral compass kicked in, but best he seemed to be able to do was let my girlfriend stand in the doorway and I was once again told that I need to sit at the bar to wait for my food or else my order would be cancelled without reimbursement. Food took forever to make.  Experience was awful.  Service is horrible.  Business ethics/policies need to seriously be reevaluated most pressingly for safety reasons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago?start=60,1.76,1.98,1.98,2.052,1.892

For reals though, I probably haven't been to one since the good ol' college days where we would take advantage of their happy hour and appetizer specials being the broke college kids we were. Anyways, a recent coupon in the mail was what sparked our interest in paying TGIF a visit. Free entree with the purchase of two drinks & another entree, why not? Maybe I haven't changed much over the years where I still can't pass up a good deal... Let's do this! So initially, we had walked in and opted to sit at the bar front hoping to get quicker service. But I should've known from all the empty glasses and left over food plates sitting on the bar that it would be awhile to get served. We sat there for just shy of 5 minutes before heading back to the hostess to grab a table and what a much better experience. Although we waited for another 5 minutes before our waitress came by with our menus, she apologized sincerely for the wait. Apology accepted. After carefully studying the menu and looking over their specials, we promptly put in our orders for their $5 special 22oz blue moon beers and our entrees, a cajun chicken & shrimp pasta & a grilled salmon caesar salad. Surprisingly the food wasn't bad at all, but then again I didn't have much expectation coming in. If you've ever had the southwestern chicken pasta from Cheesecake Factory, the flavors were almost identical for their cajun pasta. Portions could be a bit more as I did find myself still a bit hungry afterwards. All in all, not bad for just under $30 for 2 entrees and 2 beers (Reminder we had a coupon for a free entree).

I enjoyed the Cajun shrimp and chicken alfredo over linguine.  Really generous and perfectly cooked chicken and shrimp.  The ""cajun"" spices add a kick that provides heat-so much so that it took me three meals to finish this dish. (Luckily alfredo reheats well in the microwave and I got take out)! Wings were small but good (got the Jack Daniels).

42,Tanya T.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,,1.0,2017-06-27,"The only reason I gave this Friday's location even 1 star is because, my husband and I FINALLY ate!!! First of all, they asked if we preferred to sit at the bar, or a table and we chose to sit at a table. I am an average size person (size 10) and could not fit in the booth space. The table was bolted to the wall and couldn't be moved. Neither could the seat. My breasts were literally sitting on top of the table! We asked if we could get a seat outside at the bistro setting and we were told it would be another 25 minute wait. About 5 minutes later, we saw customers who arrived after us being seated outside! I ended up sharing my husband's side of the booth. Secondly, we only had appetizers and drinks and it took the waiter 30 minutes to come back with the drinks. It took another 45 mins. to an hour for them to come back with food. After knowing we were done, no one came to give us a check for at least 15-20 minutes. The place was moderately crowed, which, I tried to come up with excuses for them. But, I've seen way busier places than that especially downtown. You'd think they'd do better with this being downtown and all. Needless to say we will NOT be returning to this Friday's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago?start=20,2.44,2.03,2.03,,2.194

1,Nicola P.,"Chicago, IL",477,205,2070.0,2.0,2017-07-13,"Grabbed take-away here from ordering online and the food was alright. The fried shrimp were crispy but the fries were warm and a little lump. The side of broccoli was soft with a lemony taste that was a little too salty. The spinach was flavorful with garlic salt and tasted nice, but the portion size was laughable. I enjoyed the mozzarella/tomato salad, but there were too many red onions, which in turn, made the salad very bitter. I'm glad I didn't dine there BC the music was too loud and servers were rushing everywhere without saying excuse me. It was kind of depressing, to be honest.   Chicago being what it is with all it has to offer, I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago,2.48,2.03,2.03,,2.21

The last and final time I went to this location, I got into it with two security guards there because they had the audacity to try and rush me and a friend to eat our food and drink our drinks. It was 10min after close time, mind you.. they sat us maybe 20min before closing, no ones going to receive their meal and eat it all within 20min. If that's the case, why even seat us so close to closing time? No one sitting in a restaurant should feel rushed. We got our bill and still had a whole glass of beer to drink, these two idiot security guards were hawking us and basically telling us to hurry up. So guess what? Their asses were waiting until we got finished with the drinks we paid for and boyyyy were these idiots fuming at this point. I guess us being the last table they had to stay til we were done. Funny thing is, you would think our waiter would of had the attitude, but the security guards? Seriously? Employees (Manager too) are just very unprofessional.

We noticed the night manager inappropriate behavior in plain view, which was a surprise & we both said something to each other with confused looks on our faces. It took a moment for our appetizer to come but when it did it was good EXCEPT for the avocado that looked old darkish color. Now when our dinner came that was a different story, didn't look presentable, my black bean w avocado burger had rubbery avocados, butt end tomatoes that were dried up, slimy lettuce and hard fries not fresh, I couldn't finish my food. Her salmon was slightly charred and dry, and her spinach was seasoned heavily in certain areas. His kiddie mac n cheese was bland and watery -but he loved his strawberry shake. We did wait a moment for the follow up service plus check I ended up waving our waiter down.

I went there recently and I was surprised the menu's changed and the service was meh. They took away the daily drink specials Their house long island, margarita and Mojito were Great for like 3$-4$. Anyway I  ordered from the regular drink menu got a frozen cocktail (mind you I'm not the kind of person that complains at restaurants) But in this case, I just had to I couldn't taste any alcohol I tell the waiter and he says but it does, I insist he tastes it and he doubts and gets annoyed. I was very upset at the fact that I've paid about 10$ for a smoothie. And then when the check came I showed him my stripe points so I could claim my coupon he just wrote my rewards number. At this point, the waiter has swiped our card and we had paid full price. The Manager comes in to explain to me that the only way I can use it is if he charges us again and we'd have to wait days for the first charge to fall off. So I just wasted my 150 stripe points which were equivalent to a full rack of ribs.

0,Alex X.,"Chicago, IL",190,18,,4.0,2017-10-19,"I've been here at least 6 times now, but only ever for the endless apps deal. Regarding the endless apps: Food quality is good and consistent enough, and tastes exactly like how you expect a 10-15 dollar endless app deal to taste.  The wings are by far the best item on the endless appetizer menu and surprisingly high-quality. The jack daniels wings- my gosh I could eat those all day. Dumplings were tasty (and salty). Nachos were surprisingly good too. I've ordered the quesadilla a few times and it's always been soggy rather than crispy- still pretty good though. I thought the bbq flatbread was boring- but my friend enjoyed it. All the other menu items were okay as well- I've never been disappointed by anything except for the skillet meatballs and potato skins which I found bland. Service at this TGIF has been good- servers seem to be a bit over worked, and waits for refills can take a bit, but overall everyone here's been responsive and friendly. The only inconsistent thing has been the pricing-over the course of a year the prices have jumped between $10, $12, and $15.
