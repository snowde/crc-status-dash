14,Margaret G.,"Cincinnati, OH",2,32,,4.0,2015-09-18,Again the food is good and our waitress was slso. She also has a sense of humor.  The food came out fast and hot. All American hamburger yum.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-7,,,,,
3,Elyse F.,"Cincinnati, OH",44,358,873.0,4.0,2015-09-20,"We have visited this location a couple of times. Each time we have had great service and good food. It had been 10+ years since I had visited a TGI Friday's. Friday's has really stepped up their game. There are many interesting menu items.  Food comes out of the kitchen hot, and as ordered. I really enjoy the boneless garlic & parm buffalo wings from the appetizer menu. They come with your choice of blue cheese or ranch dressing. I opt for neither, and ask for a few lemon wedges instead. The acidity adds a nice brightness to the garlic parm sauce drizzled on top. Think crispy lemon pepper chicken. My husband loves getting the mix and match endless appetizer. Both times there were slightly different appetizer opinion.  They have a frequent dinner program. I think it's called Get More Stripe. The program allows you to earn points for purchases made. Points may be exchanged for various discounts. Sings ups may be done via their website.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-7,,,,,
13,Madison L.,"London, KY",1,10,,2.0,2015-10-17,"The service was extremely slow, and the staff was awful. They were yelling at people, telling them to get out of their way. Out waitress seemed to not ever check on us and ask how our food is, etc.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-7,,,,,
9,Olivia M.,"Cincinnati, OH",106,200,423.0,4.0,2015-10-29,This location is very small. Aesthetically it is beautiful but very small which makes the wait on a busy night pretty long. The location sits right next to Olive Garden and Logan's not very much parking unfortunately. The food however which I suppose is the most important is very good!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-7,,,,,
10,Nieka G.,"Cincinnati, OH",148,33,125.0,2.0,2016-01-05,"Our server was a true gentleman. He could tell my friend and I hadn't seen each other in awhile and were catching up. So instead of checking in on us every two minutes, he said once you've decided what to order place your menus at the end of the table and take all the time you need. Other than our server, everyone working seemed to be very young and were more interested in goofing around with one another than to pay attention to the customers in front of them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-7,,,,,
12,Tim T.,"Cincinnati, OH",26,1,,2.0,2016-05-08,"Took us an hour to get our food even though the place wasn't very busy. By that point, nothing was hot. Waitress also had an attitude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-7,,,,,
8,Brandy M.,"Middletown, OH",2,11,187.0,5.0,2016-07-15,"Seriously if I could give this place 10 stars I would. I've been to TGIF's 3 times ever, and each time is better than the last. all great experiences though. I just moved here, and I haven't been a big fan of the other restaurants around because seriously no one is friendly and the food has sucked. but we really enjoyed the whole experience here. Especially our server Tyler. He was super awesome, super polite and made sure we had everything we needed and he was so friendly. Our food was perfect and tasted amazing. we will definitely be coming back in the future. Great service, awesome food and a great atmosphere. Thanks guys!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-7,,,,,

6,Tammy S.,"Cincinnati, OH",4,1,,1.0,2017-03-09,Horrible service manager should be fired immediately I will never step foot in another TGI Friday's the food is excellent but the service is horrible,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-7,,,,,
2,Cleveland C.,"Lawrenceburg, IN",0,4,1.0,2.0,2017-05-06,Food was terrible and my wifes sandwich litterally had metal shavings in it.  I took a picture and she rduxes to eat more.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-7,,,,,
7,Kate M.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,9,2.0,2.0,2017-09-20,"We visit this Friday's often as it is convenient for shopping and close to our house.  I also am addicted to their Chicken Fingers, my go to each time.  The food is usually pretty consistent however service on our last two visits has been ridiculous.  We sit at the bar areas tables which is staffed by the bartenders.  The last two visits there has been the same guy behind the bar ""trying"" to juggle bottles, drink orders sit while he screws around and on both occasions a second bartender has been handling all tables and drink orders while he poorly attempts his juggling act.  This place clearly has no management as the other team members have to pick up for this guy which isn't feasible when they have a good crowd at the bar.  Both occasions our drinks have been very very slow to receive and we just watch him mess around without a care in the world for customers or co-workers.  I will say that the food is usually consistent however it is frustrating to wait on drinks and service.  While we love the food on most occasions we are tired of waiting on chasing service while this guy screws off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-7,,,,,
5,Lori S.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,2,,1.0,2017-09-23,"How can Friday's have the entire outside reserved on a Saturday night? So we sat at the bar and sat and sat and sat. 10 minutes and no service. By far the worst run Friday's. Its a shame, nice and new.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-7,,,,,
4,Tom Z.,"West Chester Township, OH",16,38,1.0,4.0,2017-10-21,Had a great bday dinner with my daughter and her boyfriend. Full rack of ribs with Jack Daniels glaze. $12.99 special right now. We were told 30 min wait. Seated in 20 min. Server was very pleasant and attentive. They were busy and food was delivered timely. Good experience overall!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-7,,,,,

0,Sandra H.,"Cincinnati, OH",20,85,354.0,5.0,2018-01-03,"First time I've tried their new ribs and they were beyond any expectation. The portion was huge. I've had the Brussels sprouts appetizer once before, and again they were perfectly prepared. The ribs came with French fries and coke slaw.... delicious! Service was so-so, a little slow..., and not exactly what was requested.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-7,,,,,
