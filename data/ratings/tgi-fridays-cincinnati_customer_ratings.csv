9,Tony S.,"Cincinnati, OH",23,182,232.0,4.0,2012-12-20,"OK, so I try and avoid the chain places but this is an exception. We go here with friends who are unadventurous. You pretty much know what to expect but they always make the food well. I have never had a bad meal from here. The service is always friendly and prompt. And everything taste as good as it can for a chain restaurant. So if you don't want to venture out into the unknown worlds of the local restaurants, this is a good one too go to at least.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati?start=20,2.096,2.096,2.096,2.096,2.096
12,Amy D.,"Cincinnati, OH",192,352,64.0,2.0,2013-06-05,"Hopefully this was on an of night at Friday's.  The kitchen actually did a really great job but the service was totally lacking.  Only three of our four entrees made it to the table.  This might have been ok if the server came by to check on things in a timely manner but three out of four at our table were well into their meals before the server came back and went to check on the forth entree.  We did not see our server until the checks arrived. When the checks arrived we all placed payment right away.  After waiting ten minutes for check pick up one person at our table went looking for the server.  When she returned to the table one check had been rung incorrectly- so started more waiting.  Overall, we really didn't feel like a priority at all to our server; maybe she was overbooked but there seemed to be a lot of servers when went looking for ours.  We probably won't return- at least not to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati?start=20,1.8,1.8,1.8,1.8,1.8000000000000003

15,Bill W.,"Hamilton, OH",0,7,,2.0,2014-02-08,"With the restaurant half empty, we got seated immediately by the very friendly hostess. We waited 5 minutes for the waitress to show up to take the drink order. The wife loves the appetizers so we went for the $10 endless special. Another 10 minutes for the waitress to take our food order.The hostess got me another drink before the waitress did. It took about 15 minutes from the time we ordered until we got our first order of appetizers (30 minutes in so far). After another 15 minutes our waitress was seen again and asked if we wanted more. The boneless wings came out in 10 minutes but were barely warm to the touch. After another 7-8 minutes our waitress said the cooks made the wrong thing, so we had to wait another 5 minutes for the dip. Ordered another boneless wings just to see if I could get some hot ones with them showing up mildly warm to the touch. Saw the hostess busing the tables and never once saw a busboy. I think I saw a manager across the room once (busing a table I think). Total time from seat to leaving, 1 1/2 hours. Overall- food was cold but tasted ok, service left a lot to be desired. I will never return to this Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati?start=20,1.6720000000000002,1.6720000000000002,1.6720000000000002,1.6720000000000002,1.6720000000000002

37,Courtney P.,"Cincinnati, OH",122,172,36.0,1.0,2014-11-10,"Let's be serious; it's Friday's.  I usually avoid chain restaurants with so many great dining options in town now, but sometimes you just end up there. I'd never been to the Friday's on Glenway before but it turned out to be a convenient meeting place for myself and a friend.  It was pretty quiet for a Saturday evening and I was seated right away. Our sever started off pretty attentive, almost too much as we were taking a while to decide what mediocre meal to get. I flipped through my raggedy, disorganized menu several times before I decided to get the Three for All appetizer (I considered that safe and easy) and a $4 long island iced tea (which tasted like sweet & sour mix). After placing our order we basically never heard from our server again until it was time to receive our checks.  It took our food a very long time to come out (I had a friend that came in AFTER we placed our order and she got her food before we did) and when it finally did it was cold. My potato skins were warm, my boneless wings were room temp, and my mozzarella sticks were mushy. Just a word of advice to the ladies: the bathrooms are EXTREMELY small and unclean. I had to like squeeze and shuffle just to get inside of the stall and close the door; awful.  It hurts my heart to know I spend $20 on a meal at Friday's when I could have had better food somewhere else. I probably won't go back to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003
4,Roxanne K.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,1,,2.0,2015-01-31,"My best friend and myself dined at this location tonight. We got there around 8:30pm. The wait time was roughly 15 minutes. We checked out the bar area, which is first come first serve. We found a round high top table and snatched it. So far so good.  The bartender greeted us in a reasobale time. We knew about the $10 deal, an entrée with a cocktail. Which we had to ask for the promotion menu. There was nothing on the promotion menu that caught our eye, so we ordered from the regular menu. She got a chicken dinner with mash potatoes and fresh broccoli. I ordered the 6oz sirloin with fresh spinach and a side Salad. I asked for French dressing, which came to find out they don't offer french dressing at this location, which threw me off. So I orderd ranch. I waited about 15m for my side salad. It finally came out, then sat there and waited for another 35m for our dinner entrées. Finally our meals arrived and we couldn't wait to dive in, to only find out our food was ice cold and everything had a hard coating like it sat under the heat lamps to dry up! My friends broccoli tasted like fresh broccoli that you buy in the produce section of kroger. It wasn't cooked at all. My steak was dry with no flavor and way over cooked to my liking. I prefer my steak mid-rare...it was almost well-done. We let our server know,  which she sent the manager over to ask up if we would like another entrée. We were so hungry we didn't want to wait another min for our food, so we ate what we could.  She didn't offer us a discount, dessert or an apology for that matter. I'm not one to complain either. I  will not be returning to this fridays ever. The kenwood location is much better!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati?start=20,1.6400000000000001,1.6400000000000001,1.6400000000000001,1.6400000000000001,1.6400000000000003

2,Courthney C.,"Cincinnati, OH",8,2,,1.0,2015-04-03,"My family party of 5 walked into TGIF at 653pm to have what we thought would be a nice family dinner. It actually ended up being the WORST dining experience EVER!!!! We ordered our food about 7:10. We did not receive our meal until 7:53 (and it was cold, apparently it sat under a food  heater) In all of my years of dining I have never waited over 49 mins for food especially when the restaurant was not packed! So we tell our server who was awesome that we wanted to speak to the manager at this time it is now 7:56pm....the manager did not arrive at our table until 8:22pm our cold food is still sitting at our table. Again this is not acceptable.  When the manager (Bre) finally comes to our table she is quite rude and had no empathy for us in our awful dining experience! She argued with us and made us out to be the bad guy when in fact we were the victims of horrible service and cold food. She did offer to take some money off the bill when in fact all we wanted was to make things right, and receive great quailty food. I did not reorder my food which was the Rib, shrimp and jack daniel strip appertizer it was very dark as if the cooking grease was old and it was cold,  but another person in our party did and we waited another 20 minutes for her remake to arrive at our table.  At this time its now almost 9pm. Another party around us left shortly after because they waited too long to even be served drinks, another table around us sent their plate back 3x because of its temperature, and once Bre did come over she said she had 8 other tables demanding her attention all complaints I am sure. Bre did however win the kids over with free desert (the least she could do) This woman should NOT be in management, making the paying customer feel bad, being confrontational, not willing to make things right, and not following up with guests to check on our dining experience. MOST managers come around to your table withing the first 20 minutes to see how things are, had Bre done that she wqould have seen that we didnt even have our food yet!   Another party asked who the manager was and Bre replied ""I am"" as she went to their table and began to tell them how much we spent on food, how much she comped us, and what our issue was ALL within ear shot of us. Totally unprofessional and rude and out of line. I expected way more out of a ""manager"" and this establishment. I will NEVER return to this location EVER!!!!!!! Crestview Hills knows how to treat their customers and it worth the drive!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati?start=20,,,,,
38,Amy K.,"Covington, KY",352,30,7.0,3.0,2015-04-26,"I am giving this a 3 instead of a 4 because I feel the food is too expensive for what you get and I do not like the variety of the menu.  I have been to this location 3 times.  Each time has been a good dining experience.  I am not a TGI Friday's fan but this is the best TGI Friday's I have been to (which isn't saying much). What you should know:  NO wait, the few times I have been because there are very few patrons at this location it seems.   Each time, silverware has been dirty (just ask for new).  Servers are nice enough but do not make you feel overly comfortable.  They will easily take back food they mess up but do not comp meals (for example, last night it was a steak not cooked to order).  As I said, too expensive for what you get - $40 for 2 meals with water as the drink.  The food, overall, has had very good flavors at this location.  I would recommend the Jack Daniels chicken with mashed potatoes, the Jack sauce is nice on the potatoes.  For a sit down restaurant on the west-side, this one is 'ok' but there are better ones.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati,,,,,

There were only 7 tables occupied and they had at least 4 people on the floor at various times but no one took my order.  If I was black I would file a discrimination complaint but this place needs a complete total make over from top to bottom.  The management needs to go, all the staff need to go.  Probably in reality TGI needs to yank the franchise.  This type of treatment is giving the entire TGI Friday brand a black eye.  I just want to warn the people of Cincinnati, Don't go to TGI Fridays in Western Hills you will waste your money and may not even get your order taken.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati?start=20,,,,,

31,Tim S.,"Cincinnati, OH",12,12,1.0,1.0,2017-01-10,HURRY IN WHILE THIS LOCATION REMAINS OPEN! Today was the worst lunch experience my family has had in years at any restaurant ... even though there were less than half a dozen tables occupied with plenty of staff on hand. We clearly told the waiter we were going to use BOGO entree coupons for lunch that TGIF just emailed us that expired tomorrow. Unfortunately the waiter did not comprehend our order after repeating clearly numerous times our intent with his acknowledgement. Upon receiving the receipt the waiter then told us he could not use BOGO coupons as items we selected were on special ... even though we told him to charge full menu price and use BOGO coupon at better price. He insisted he could not nor could his GM change the receipt nor did he want to assist us further. When we asked to speak to the manager he insulted us and accused us (aka the customer that is always right) of taking advantage of him and TGIF ... what by using coupons TGIF emailed to us? I guess we were taking advantage of his complete ignorance attempting to comprehend our simple food order. Needless to say the GM was professional when we spoke with him as the waiter clearly lied to his GM telling him a completely different story as GM said receipt adjustments were simple corrections had he been informed by his lazy ignorant waiter. BTW did I mention we were missing order items and eating cold food while salads came with no dressing. Some people just should not be employed in the public work force as it is best they rely on food stamps as they were raised. Needless to say we won't and can't recommend this location to anyone as it continues to decline each visit and soon will/should close.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12

26,Heather C.,"Lexington, KY",23,1,,1.0,2017-02-27,"I've never been so disappointed in a restaurant. I live by a different Fridays and I go there often, always get friendly and fairly quick service. The case was the exact opposite at the western hills location on Sunday. Being at your restaurant over two hours, never even getting a smile from our waitress. 30 minutes to get a water. 20 minutes to get a draft beer, that was warm because it probably sat at the bar for so long before being brought to us. We got the endless apps, which were cold. And took almost 45 per app. Instead of enjoying my food, I asked for my check after only two apps (not even getting my money worth). I asked for my check because I couldn't stand my rude server any longer. A bus boy brought our food, and asked if we needed anything. Someone in our party had to go track our waitress down to ask for more water. After asking for our checks, our waitress decided we no longer wanted the food we ordered, so she cancelled it without telling us. Leaving us waiting another 45 minutes for some damn cheese sticks. She brings me said food, however, brings the wrong Food, something I didn't order. I told her that. She didn't offer to take it back. I asked to speak with the manager whom said something of the following;  ""We are very busy today and understaffed. Endless apps are a busy time and it's hectic and they take longer. I will talk to her but there's nothing more I can do.""  Not to mention there were very few people in the restaurant, so it's not because they were busy.

35,Becky R.,"Cincinnati, OH",19,6,,1.0,2017-05-29,"This doesn't deserve even one star. The terrible service started before our order was taken, even though the restaurant was empty it took quite a while for a server to come for drink orders. When the partial orders of drinks did arrive my iced tea was wrong. Two drinks didn't come! The first plate that came was disgusting the cheese on the potato skins was dried out crusted old the ranch dressing was also hard and crusty. The toddler ate it but the adults were grossed out. The rest of the endless apps were given to another table. We never got refills of the waters. The person who ordered a bottle of beer and a water never received his water. When the burger arrived it had the wrong toppings the bun was soggy and the fries were cold. At that point we asked for a manager. We were told he was stuck in the kitchen, but he came out with food for other tables. So we called the restaurant by phone and another person came out she told us "" Friday's we take care of the check for us""  wow",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati,1.8,1.8,1.8,,1.8000000000000003
21,Kenni 2.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,3,1.0,1.0,2017-09-29,"This place is bad,usually the bar ignores you when you do take out orders. However pick up was perfect,which should have been a red flag. I ordered the black bean burger with all the fixings. Received a plain burger and about 13 cold fries. The burger was cold as well, I am officially done with this location. Maybe a management change would help. I'm sure the manager is aware of what's occurring at the bar area. Or perhaps this location should get rid of pick up from the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati,1.8,1.8,1.8,,1.8000000000000003
20,J J.,"Cincinnati, OH",3,46,,1.0,2017-10-19,This was easily the worst meal I've had in years...ordered a draft beer and it was brought out nice and HOT (seriously...it was like it was not only not refrigerated but possibly heated!) Then we had some potato skins and they were really obviously premade and heated...little to nothing on top. Turkey Avocado sandwich arrived and the meat we terrible and avocado still hard (i.e. not ripened.) The place was maybe a quarter full a dinner hour and there seems to be a reason way...food and service were not good. The one thing that usually you can't screw up (a DRAFT BEER) was screwed up. Won't be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002
