Also, I ordered fajitas. It was the worst fajitas I have ever had. I should've known not to order fajitas from an american restaurant. They didn't have refried beans, the rice tasted bad and so did the black beans... it tasted like plastic. The fajitas at chevy's which is right by there are so much better. That night I completely regretted going to TGIF's.

You are charging us for string beans when there was a hair on the plate.  We told the waitress about the double charge and that they only removed the one string bean order and the waitress was not happy but she did tell her boss and they removed the other order of string beans.

Friday's, especially the amazing boneless buffalo bites, but I'm so disappointed in last night's entree.  I ordered the dragonfly salmon with a side of ginger-lime slaw instead of rice.     If that is the amount of rice I would have gotten then I would have ordered the rice for portion control.  But to give the equivalent of about an 1/8 of cup of slaw is ridiculous.  I was so shocked that I really thought it was a joke.  A little more ginger-lime slaw and I wouldn't have brought home a doggy bag.  If I had the balls to ask the waitress for more I would have, but I shouldn't have had to in the first place.   There are a lot of other restaurants near this T.G.I.

People pile in the front waiting area and kind of end up where people are seated eating. I've seen people at their tables eating with butts in their face. The food itself is good when it comes out fresh. TGIF seems to go through waiters and crew fast though as I always hear apologies for the ""new staff"" in training every time I go. Last night was no exception. They had new food runners and I guess my dinner got lost. My parents got both their meals and mine didn't come out for another almost ten minutes. At least it tasted great when I did finally get it. Not sure if I was just starving by then though. As it took almost 10 minutes to get our drink orders in. Overall this place isn't bad though.

82,Beth W.,"West Haven, CT",3,9,,1.0,2013-05-17,"I can not believe how horrible the service was. I go to Friday's in Orange CT all the time and it's great. We took my son-in law out for lunch after graduation around 1:30. The place was not busy at all the waitress we had only had 2 tables a 4 top and a 3 top. We had 4 adults and 1 baby in our group. First it took her ( an African american with short hair) 10 minutes to acknowledge us and how does she do it I'm coming what is that suppose to mean? It was 5 minutes after that she came back to the table didn't even tell us her name. We ordered appetizers and soup. I presented a twenty five percent off coupon because I am a stripes member and she said I'll get the information once you put in the whole order. Well our appetizers came (no free chips) and she still hadn't come back to our table to take our order. We were out of drinks and ran out of chips for the spinach dip and ate all the other appetizers before she even came back to take our dinner order. She acted surprise that we had finished our appetizers in the 30 minutes she has been gone so we finally put in our order ask for more chips (never got them) had to ask 3 times for our margarita. Food came my daughters steak was well done not med rare but we didn't dare send it back in fear that it would be another hour. During the time she took our order for appetizers and before she came back to take the order for our meal she walked by us 15 times and never said a word, and when she finally did it was those famous words I'm a coming I should have said yeah when. Then after we finish the dip with our forks she says 45 min later I guess you don't need the chips (really) half way through dinner again we said the margarita finally she brought it not so much frozen anymore.Then to top it off after the 2 hours we spent there the hostess and a waitress was sitting at a table next to the door talking and the waitress was painting her nails not a nice scent when your eating. Is their even a manager running this place or does everyone just run wild. So disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton?start=100,2.16,2.16,2.16,1.988,2.16
56,Will A.,"Montclair, NJ",62,82,209.0,5.0,2013-05-28,My favorite Fridays to visit. I usually go to the bar so I don't know much about the actual restaurant servers. Each of the bartenders are awesome but my favorite is Mario. He's awesome and we usually talk about sports or anything else going on. Lisa is another bartender and is friendly as well. The servers who bring out the food when you order are very nice an friendly.  My only complaint is that they downsized on the Jack Daniels Burger. They now give you half the fries they used to give an the burger seems a little smaller as well. The only thing that hasn't changed about it is the price. Regardless I still love it and I consider myself a regular even though I'm sure Mario & Lisa see a lot of the same people.

The second time I went was on a weekend @ about 1pm which isn't peak hr so I figured the food would be pretty decent. NOT!!!! My chicken was cold, my shrimp were cold, my baked potato was disgusting it was horrible. I sent it all back and just ordered hot wings.  They sucked too but not as bad. I went a 3rd time on the 4th of July @ about 11:30 @ night. They didn't have the drink I wanted and I was informed they ran out yesterday!!! YESTERDAY REALLY??!!! Ummm ok. When I ordered my food they were out of baked potatoes. Wow really never been to a Fridays that ran out of baked potatoes. My ribs were horrible. Which are usually good @ any other Fridays. I didn't tell the manager cause for 1 I didn't want a free nasty meal from here and 2 I knew I would never return. They have struck out 3 times with me I will never go back and they will never get my hard earned money for that nasty food ever again. I'm sure it's just this Fridays cause I never had a problem anywhere else. Don't waste ya time going there.

67,D C.,"Wayne, NJ",3,58,20.0,2.0,2013-09-20,"I've been here quite a few times before as it's close to several places that I go to. Normally I have a normal, TGI Fridays experience. Mediocre food, that just happens to taste ok, and it's relatively cheap. My mother and I went there for dinner last night and if it wasn't for other experiences there being better, this review would have been one star. We arrive around 8PM, maybe a little before. We waited at the front desk, stand thingy for about 5 minutes before someone seated us, mind you the place was less than half full. Ok...The waiter comes and asks for our drink order which was just water with lemon and that comes out in a timely fashion. Here's where the visit really starts to go south. We order our meals (appetizers and entrees) and it takes about 25 minutes for our apps to come out. Now, I've dined at very high end places in my life and I know that perfection takes time (not that I was expecting perfection at a TGI Fridays, but you know what I mean) but i've still never waited more than 15 minutes for an appetizer (especially one that was probably premade and frozen). FInally the apps get to us. I forgot something in my car so I ran out and came back and my mom tells me that they had brought our entrees out and she sent them back considering we had only had our appetizers for all of 2 minutes. 10 minutes later our entrees come out cold of course. We were going to send them back but it wasn't even worth it. We ate some of our food, gave a pretty crappy tip and left. I can't even say that I won't be back here, because I probably will be.

How I know this, bc I have been regular at this place since so many years.... lost the count. lol;)  Its like any other Food chain restaurant but it has bigger bar area then a normal restaurant/Bar. You have a choice to sit on the bar or if you come with many people then you can grab one of those high table in the corner. Most times there is no wait at the bar area tables...which is the best part of this TGIF- More space less Waite LoL ;).  I am a very picky person when it comes to restaurants and food. Well, I started going to the TGIF one on Rt17 b/c of my friend Brian.K  use to work as a bartender. He is a very sweet guy who is good at making drinks and best customer service. He is very friendly and talkative and customers are always up and enjoying some nice conversation with good food. Also, I go to TGIF on rt 3 b/c its near to group of friends I hangout with.... servers at rt3 TGIF are also very nice and respective. They will suggest good food and drinks to you if needed. Wait staff is very young and anxious.  I went there with few friends on the day of Sandy for dinner. we waited for long time as that place was flooded with people but when we were seated our serve brought food within 10 min. He made us some good delicious food on that cold and rainy night.  First of all, this place is very convenient to everyone as its right off Rt 3 by the small shopping mall in Clifton, NJ. Every experience that I had at this TGIF made me want to write something good about the place. second of all, I like this place b/c it has HAPPY HOURs on Sundays and after 10 pm everyday around bar area, BEST EVER!!!!!!!!!. Place where you can come and quench you alcohol thirst for less $. They have beers, margaritas, Sangrias, Electric lemonade (My Fav), etc... They also have half off appetizers which includes different kinds of wings!!!!.   The only thing that really bother me at this place is that....instead of having a big bar area they should also have some big screen TV's. There Tv's are too small to watch games on a football Sunday. Atleast one big screen TV around bar area and this place with always be flooded with people.  I think overall its a nice place to hangout when needed.... well,  this is what I concluded from my experiences and I hope you experiences are positive at this place. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton?start=80,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.256,2.52

My friend ordered a steak and it was so black and burnt it was ridiculous. I wouldn't have even fed that to my nonexistent dog.

First of all the bartenders are like grabbing each others asses and private parts in front of customers. Second of all there is this one bartender named Sarah she has blonde hair, sounds ditsy.  She got me a drink which was the captains cup which is suppose to be in the Fridays jars. As I got the drink it was in a shot glass which is filled with ice and fruits, with no alcohol. She knew I was annoyed with how the drink was made, and that was 10 bucks what a rip off. So I decided to get a guiness when I got the beer it was somewhat cold and somewhat warm. I don't know about anyone else but a beer should be cold. So I was not pleased with the service. So I paid for the bill which was 25.15 and I gave her 50.15 it took her 10 minutes to give me back my change. The reason was she was too busy flirting with some customer, or she didn't know how much to give back to me. All I know this place sucks I will definitely call corporate on her ass. Avoid Sarah very bad customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton?start=100,2.56,2.56,2.56,1.924,2.56

I said it like 3 times, I am allergic to the seasoning please do not put seasoning on my burger or fries. I also ordered my burger medium. Burger comes back. Fries have no seasoning-I can see that. The burger, I get half way through and, come the middle, I bite into a cluster of seasoning. It's all under the cheese. I send it back. The waiter is panicking. I told him, don't worry, I am not going to die, but I am sure to get pretty sick in a few hours. He brings me a new burger. Cool. No seasoning. Burger looks a little pinker than it should. The fries-have seasoning. I stopped eating. I did not get charged for the burger, but I got insanely sick that night.

It's one of those places that I can go for lunch but I usually choose not to because there are better places in the area for the same price. We found ourselves here with a party of 30 for their endless appetizers though so here I am after 10 years of not having TGIF.  The price is decorated nicely. the seats are comfy. I think overall the atmosphere is good. We had a group of 30 and that hard for them to fit....it was def. very crowded. They gave us a giant long table against a wall so basically people sitting inside against the wall couldn't get out. We were smart enough to cut the tables into smaller sets so people can slip out in the middle (Idk they didn't do that to start with). We ordered a ton of the appetizers. Lots of different deals. I appreciate their Happy Hour Prices - lots of 1/2 price stuff, endless appetizers for $10, and $1.50 things. Their sliders were good, wings were good with all the different sauces, potato skins were good too. Not a huge fan of the fried string beans (also don't think it's worth the price), or the mozz sticks. I liked the Gold Medalist Smoothie. One problem I have with TGIF is they don't list prices on half of their drinks menu. Like, what? When I asked the wait staff, they were unsure of the exact price and gave me estimates. ..... I don't understand why it's a thing to not list prices on the menu in your restaurant. I know people do it on their online menus but their real ones? Are you trying to tell me it's free? Or trying to trick me into getting something expensive? The wait staff was very nice and friendly. Alex was our waitress and she was really great-flexible with our orders and didn't get frustrated with our large group. They had like 2-3 waiters/waitresses for our entire group. That went well.

Since the games were on the hostess said they wouldn't even know when a table would be available, completely understanding.  For starters I ordered the strawberry lemonade which I highly recommend. (they charge you .75c after for every refill) I also got the clam chowder soup, not that great. It was okay but I would def not order it again.  One thing that really turned me off was their silverware. Water spots all over, looks pretty gross. I opened three other rolled up silverware until I found a decent one.  Again I know this should be expected obviously I'm not at a five star restaurant but at least keep the silverware somewhat decent looking.  For my meal I ordered the rib eye steak & lobster tail, with baked Potatoe and rice as my two sides. I ordered my steak medium well, and after eating my lobster I stared to cut up my steak and in the inside was still pretty pink (Huge turn off) I didn't say anything because it was not bleeding but it def should've been cooked better. I just continued to eat the rest of my food and decided to take the steak to go.  Our waiter was so nice and friendly, if he wouldn't have been so nice I would've prob complained about the silverware and my steak. I never went to be that person but sometimes it ruins your whole dining experience. The baked potatoe, rice and lobster were delicious which honestly I wouldn't expect it.

For lunch we got the jack daniels grilled chicken sandwich and the triple stack ruben. My wife enjoyed her chicken sandwich and my ruben was okay it was more rye the corned beef but i should have know better being it was a triple stack that it would be more bread but it was still tasty. There are a few places in the area that make a better ruben so i would probably go with something else next visit. Just a question are you guys pre cooking your fries now ?

Then she continued to yell at another waitress from across the room. I know my manager would be MORTIFIED if this was his place. The manager ought to spend a day here because he/she clearly doesn't.... The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because that class act of a girl was not our waitress (ours was wonderful) and because our appetizer was delicious; the burger that came without the avocado I ordered, not so much.

The shrimp were also cold and tasted like cardboard bits with breading. My wife had surf and turf. She had to send it back. The steak was a cold hockey puck and the lobster tail was a salty mess.

When the check came it was about $94 and we were surprised to see that they were all priced at $6.25+.  I asked our waiter about this and he stated that was the domestic draught beers only included Budweiser, Coors, etc.  I explained to him that the sign said domestic beers and all the beers we ordered were produced in America and therefore are domestic beers.  He sent over the manager to speak to us and she apologized and said she would remove 2 of the Endless Apps ($10 each) from the check so that the total would have been what we expected.  However, when she dropped off the new check it was for $86 and we realized that she had only removed $8.  After mentioning this to our waiter he apologized and said he would talk to the manager again and get them removed, so we gave him our credit card.  When he returned we saw that he had still charged the credit card for the full $86 rather than removing the items that the manager said she would remove.  Overall, I am very disappointed with the service I received and the damper it put on what should have been a celebratory night watching my Nova Wildcats make it to the NCAA championship game.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton?start=60,2.32,2.32,2.32,1.924,2.32

Our server was very nice although she seemed like she may just had a couple cups of coffee. Ordered wings, the lobster and steak and the finally the ribs and shrimp entree with various lemonade drink mixtures.  First issue is that one of my guest asked for wild rice which they didn't have and instead of checking she was given white rice. Wasn't much of a big deal at first. The second issue was the ribs and shrimp entree. I ended up getting just ribs with 2 sides. Upon asking if my ribs came with shrimp I was told they'd be right out. They were brought out 12 minutes 32 seconds later piping hot which I learnt upon attempting to try one. At. this point my meal was pretty much completed. Ended having to let them sit for a while before I could eat them.  Once the check came however I was charged separately for my meal. In the past if a server was going to do this they made sure to inform me. Usually I wouldn't be too bothered but considering that I stated both when I was ordering as well as after my meal came that I was expecting the entree that came with shrimp and not two separate orders I was more than a little upset. As a former server and a business owner anything that affects or changes the bill of the client is usually something you inform them about. Upon questioning about this I was told it's a common mistake and she didn't know which I wanted and that they couldn't do anything about it.  I think that statement in itself contradicts with good customer service. Assuming you have multiple things on the menu your job as a server is to clarify which and common practice to repeat the order. If I order wings you don't guess at which sauce I want it in. Used to be a regular but I might take a break for a while not sure if I'll be back but I work near the area often so we'll see.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton,2.52,2.38,2.38,,2.436

But I recently just went on a Sunday and they close at 1am, but they started closing down at 12am, turned off all the tvs, called last call and one of the bartenders said ""everyone finish up cause you gotta get outta here!"" I've never experienced such rude behavior here. I don't know why she wanted to kick everyone out when they weren't even closed yet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton?start=20,2.4,2.35,2.35,,2.37
10,Stephanie W.,"Hartford, CT",105,14,10.0,1.0,2017-05-20,"This location used to be my favorite Friday night spot. So of course on a random night when looking for a last minute spot to connect with a friend I suggested this restaurant. The server was kind , event with the strong cigarette smoke permeating from his person, but the service was slow. We both ordered the app combo with wings, potato skins and pot stickers. The wings tasted and appearred  to have been reheated multiple times they were so dry, the skins were overcooked with little yo no cheese... I didnt even bother with the pot stickers. To make it worse, I couldn't even wash it down with my margarita as their was a hair floating in my beverage. I returned the drink and gave up on the food. Such a disappointing experience and a total waste of my funds. Won't make this mistake again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton,2.24,2.33,2.33,,2.2940000000000005
5,Hannah V.,"Madison, NJ",113,125,145.0,3.0,2017-06-08,"Came here for lunch on a Wednesday. It was pretty empty. The lady in the front was nice and we got seated right away. Our waitress was not in a good mood because I saw her arguing maybe a supervisor or something, but she was nice to us. Besides not really smiling, she was polite when she spoke to us. They got my bf's drink wrong but she changed it right away. His mom's drink had practically all ice. She finished the drink in 5 sips. The spinach dip was good. I had the chicken bruschetta pasta which came out good.j",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton,2.2,2.33,2.33,,2.2780000000000005

9,Nicole S.,"East Orange, NJ",12,3,1.0,2.0,2017-07-15,"For a day that was not busy, they were really unorganized. The server would take our order and when the items came one thing was always missing. Ordered drink forget one, order entrée forget one.  Ordered a burger medium well, it was still mooing when they brought it to the table.  Waited 7 minutes  then was told it will take another 10 min. I just canceled the order because by time it gets there the rest of the party would have to wait for me to eat.  He still brings out and was like you sure you still don't want it.  Yes I'm sure that why I said to cancel it 10 min ago.  He did try to redeem himself by giving the kids desserts for free. The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth. Oh yeah the the grey goose lemonade was all lemonade and no grey goose.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton,2.24,2.37,2.37,,2.3180000000000005
16,Barbara W.,"Clifton, NJ",0,5,,2.0,2017-08-04,"So disappointed in this place. Was here last night with two of my friends so we could have a girls night and catch up on life and the service could not have been worse. We sat down by the bar and waited till 10 to order drinks for happy hour, and I decided to get endless apps. I, was more than certain that when I order endless apps, the first thing I'd order would be a regular size portion and there after, whatever I put in to order would be half the size, or at least smaller portions. Fine. I was told to order two endless app dishes, thinking I'd get a whole quesadilla and a regular size portion of boneless bites. Guess what, I sure as hell didn't get that, in fact I got less than half the size portion of each dish I ordered....oh and it took about 25 minutes for the food to come out, so when it did, i take a bite out of my food. It's between cool and lukewarm at best. I was pissed. Both at the portion size and the temperature I got my food, but I kept my mouth shut, dealt with it and ate it. Our server (don't remember her name) was no freaking better. She probably came to check on our table a total of 5 times. Totally unacceptable. Oh and she didn't even clear the empty plates off the table when we finished with the first round of apps. Making us piles plates one on another. Definitely not okay. Our bill came up to $50 and guess what we left a $5 tip. Why? Service and attentiveness. I didn't even feel bad, I used to be a server too where I was paid $1.18 an hour and most times, my checks were void and my only income was tips. Since this was the case, when it came to service, I'd bust my ass to make that tip and make sure I was tipped. But also make sure my tables and the guests were happy with everything. To make sure all was how they wanted it. To make sure their glasses were filled..not half ass a job you don't give a shit about and magically hope that a table would leave you a 18-20% tip on shit service. Doesn't work like that unfortunately. All in all, this specific Friday's has gone to the dump and I won't be returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton,2.28,2.37,2.37,,2.334
1,Dominga R.,"Sayreville, NJ",0,4,5.0,1.0,2017-10-01,"The server was very good considering the amount of people in the restaurant  The atmosphere was ok but the TVs were too loud which makes a hard to have a conversation with who ever you are with  Cleanness of the place were pretty good  Food presentation awful, food were cold , stale , taste were not as a expected.  The drinks were pretty good but they should do better  The server at any moment came to us to find out wether we were satisfied with the service  The place is a bit too dark should be a bit more illuminated since is daytime  Overall will not recommend to anyone  There's too many other places you can spend your money and have a better service",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton,2.28,2.37,2.37,,2.334
12,Vienna B.,"Little Falls, NJ",206,7,1.0,2.0,2017-10-01,"I have been going to this TGI Fridays location for years, and it has always been one of my favorite go-to spots for my friends and I. The wings are a TGI Fridays staple and I usually order them with a meal and they're always good. I visited this location with my boyfriend today, and it was not the best experience. Once seated, we waited for over 20 minutes for a server to come to our table. Eventually a woman came over to our table (She looked like she may have been a manager, I'm not sure) to serve us. She was very nice, but not very attentive. However, I could see that the place was relatively understaffed, and having been a waitress myself for years, I understand the position that she was in (especially if she was a manager stepping in). We waited a very long time for our food to come out, and when we got our food, our wings were less than satisfactory. They were so over cooked that it was hard to even take a bite. A few of the wings were burnt down to the bone. The sauce was fine, but it could barely cover up the taste and texture of burnt, rubbery chicken. The bleu cheese was also quite warm, which indicated that the wings may have been sitting on a hot table for a long time. I'm not sure if I will be coming back to order wings anytime soon, because I can't be certain that they won't be burnt again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton,2.32,2.37,2.37,,2.35

0,Earl G.,"Clifton, NJ",7,102,422.0,4.0,2018-01-05,"We ate here on New Year's eve. I was surprised that it was not as crowded as I thought it would be. However that said, they were busy enough and the food this visit, because we had visited here several times before, was the best we've had yet!  We had the ribs we had one with the Jack Daniels sauce and the other one without. Both were great but I definitely recommend the Jack Daniels sauce! Our waitress that we had, was excellent. She was very attentive but not intrusive that we enjoyed our meal. In the many places that we've gone to have food this was one of the top five waitresses we had so far!  Our waitress told us about the dinner, appetizer and drink specials, but since we were going home to drink at New Year's we did not indulge in the drink specials.   Based on our past meals here and combined with our latest meal we are giving us four stars, but we may up it to five stars if the service continues as good as it did this latest visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton,1.96,2.36,2.36,,2.2
