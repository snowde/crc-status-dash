1,Greg D.,"College Station, TX",3350,3290,41724.0,1.0,2013-05-28,"And another one bites the dust.   (C) Queen.   Well surprise!   George Carlin actually touched on the eventual demise of these and I quote ""Places with cutesy names.."" like TGI Fridays and the list goes on.   Applebees, BJ's, it's all the same lab designed sodium laced garbage with some alcohol to wash it down.   Yeah, the party is over here.   Went by yesterday and it's boarded up.   Now what will I do with my E-Coupon? YEAH!   One less place peddling sodium laced junk food.   See, if you have time or care to read my review back in 2009, TGI FRYDAYS!  (Sorry, can't get George Carlin's voice out of my head) was one of the last remaining companies in the US to refuse to disclose to their consumers how much sodium was in their food.   That's why I quit eating there.   And quit eating at Chili's, and Applebees and the latest incarnation of sodium poison disasters to grace mall parking lots, BJ's.   It's all the same.   Now, this sodium and alcohol giant with a good location on University Drive, the gateway to Texas A&M University where it was convenient for obese America's parents to eat with their Ashley's, Brittanys, Megans, Kyles and Bryans on rare weekends they were in town to visit their college kids, what's up with Applebees?   After all, Applebees serves the same crap, and is kinda hidden off behind some construction on Texas Avenue.    I'll predict that the bell is gonna toll for Applebees soon.   I hope so. And the ultimate sodium and alcohol vendor, Chili's.....    Feel bad for the people that lost their jobs because I liked the kids at TGI Fridays.  But in an economy when eating out calls for more educated choices, these salt like snake oil places need to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-college-station,,,,,
0,Lindy C.,"College Station, TX",0,18,,4.0,2013-05-30,I'm actually sorry to see them go.  I really liked their Strawberry Fields Salad.  In spite of the other reviews I had consistently good food and service here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-college-station,,,,,
