Got a yummy Pomegranate Ultimate Margarita for $5, so wasn't too upset that my BBQ Chicken Wrap was lacking in flavor and freshness. Fries were decent but nothing stood out.  For some reason, the staff always seems nicer to one another than to the guests. They're always laughing and joking, which makes me wonder why can't I get some of that love? Just sayin'....

75,Arnus M.,"Columbia, MD",0,19,,2.0,2012-08-22,"Friday's is a place that has not adjusted to other bars in the area, and whose indifferent staff just doesn't cross the finish line.   Food - Pub food, burgers and a few specialty dishes.  Example:  The Korean tacos?  Clearly designed by Kim Jong Un with the hidden 'where's the beef' meat.  Best value is probably the unlimited soup and salad. Service - I used to frequent the bar, where previously, veteran talent and service made the difference.  Alas, the vets are gone, and their replacements are sadly not up to speed.  Example:  I waited 25 minutes in a nearly empty (4 other bar patrons) for a burger, and further watched the blonde bartender chat up some other patrons in lieu of serving customers. Location:  Good, right off of 95.  Protip:  Try not to fuel up at the world's most expensive Exxon up the street, and if hitting HH, be mindful of the county's finest trolling to waylay you after a sip or two.. Other:  Good HH times.  Fridays and Saturday nights, mind the thumping at the bar as the quasi hip-hop DJing begins.  Mianly younger crowd. If you are looking for chain pub fare, there's the Greene Turtle (younger), Applebee's (yuck, not my style), Frisco Burrito (good beer selection, but expensive), and Victoria's up the street (slightly older crowd, little more expensive).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbia?start=60,1.768,1.768,1.768,1.768,1.7680000000000002

106,Kat M.,"Crawford, TX",0,2,,1.0,2013-08-31,"Decided to go to TGIFridays.   Got seated right away.  Not really crowded.  Waited something like 7 or 8 minutes before a server came to take drink orders.  As he took my order, he suggested we order dinner because he was ""running all over the place tonight.""  We were ready so we did. After ordering we asked him to bring us utensils.  He came back about 12 minutes later and said he would bring us drink refills.  We said thanks and could he bring us utensils. Food came out about 15 minutes after that.  We asked for utensils and he said ""Oh.  Sure.""  5 minutes later no refills, no utensils.  Sean gets up and wanders around the restaurant picking up rolled utensils pcks from empty tables.  He got 3 and said his ribs/shrimp could be finger food. another 5 minutes and our server is checking on the table behind us.  I get his attention and ask for refills.  He says ""OH...sure.""  Then looks and says ""Do you need utensils?""  We say no we wandered the restaurant and got our own. Another 5 minutes and finally refills. Son had debated about a dinner and decided to go with ribs and shrimp.  His plan was that some of the ribs would be leftover for another meal.   He is eating and says ""Mom, is this normal?""  Peels of a sheet of something from the bottom of the ribs.  We look at it and are pretty sure it is plastic.  He said he had pulled some off the others but decided to look at the bottom before he went further.  We call the server over, tell him and he says he will get the manager.  (He has to wait as the manager is talking to another table who are complaining about the service). Manager comes over, sticks his fingers in the ribs and starts explaining to us that the ribs come frozen.  Probably the plastic stuck to frozen ribs.  He asks Son if he wants more ribs - Son laughs and says No.  He did offer a dessert but we declined. He takes Son's plate and leaves with the sheet of plastic (about the size of half a sheet of paper). We don't see him again.  Server comes over with our check.  He says ""Did someone come over and help you?""  I said we spoke briefly to the manager.  he says ""Yeah he says you are all wrong  it isn't plastic...its fat.""  Fat that didn't melt down when ribs were cooked?  Or ribs cooked so long ago the fat solidified like a sheet of plastic?  I said ""we disagree but thanks."" The check did remove my son's dinner cost - but no apology or anything.  We are upset and nervous about the potential that my son has consumed some of this plastic.  A truly bad experience with potential health hazards.

110,L W.,"Gwynn Oak, MD",0,1,,1.0,2014-03-16,"Let me start by saying.... RIDICULOUS! Let me next say our waiter was fabulous. The front end greeters were horrible. I know there is a so called science to seating diners and managing a dining room, but Really?? We arrived - a party of 6, on a Saturday evening (630pm) expecting a wait. When got inside we realized the dining room was maybe half full.  We were greeted and told that we would have a 35 to 40 minute wait.  After waiting 45 minutes we asked the hostess how much longer we could expect to be waiting and if it was possible to be seated at a table that had been empty since we arrived.  She kind of looked at us but said she had one more group of 8 ahead of us. Not sure where this group was but we said ""OK"". We did realize there were a lot of parties of 2 who were not being seated and there were 4 table for 2 in a row empty. Finally half of us sat down at the table close to the door that had been empty for the last hour. We then asked is it possible to get this table since you have seated the party of 8. They said yes, give them a minute. Not sure at that point what we were waiting for but we said ""OK"". Finally we all sat down and asked passing waitresses for menus.  She said yes retrieved menus and brought them to us.  Finally, we can eat. We were all relieved. Mind you it has now been 1hour and 20 minutes. RIDICULOUS. They were not even crowded. Now we know why, they were not crowded. Our waiter came over offered us drinks and/or water. MIKE was his name. Very low key quiet guy but Great. And the drinks were great.  That's the best I can say. Our food was awful. it was cold. My burger was dry and stiff as if it had been sitting for hours. My friends food was Luke warm and she just said whatever at that point. My other girlfriend got the Jack Daniels sampler only for that to look like they just thrown it on the plate. I forgot to mention after waiting a hour and 20 minutes to get seated we waited 45 minutes for burgers and pasta. Kill me already. Our waiter went to check on our food multiple times. Did I mention the drinks were good.  After we had had enough and I was at my wits end, I asked to speak with a manager- Ed the assistant manager came over. I proceeded to tell him how unhappy we were with our food, he cut me off and said ""Hold up you need to speak with the Kitchen Manager - Senior Manager (as he put it). I thought that was rude, condescending and unacceptable. I just said ""OK"". He comes back about 4 minutes later only to say that the manager said he is to busy to speak with us. He does not have time. We were told to call 1-800-FRIDAYS.  RIDICULOUS.  I was shocked. I am not usually left speechless but I was. I was dumbfounded. But what did we expect  from the beginning. Customer service was lacking.  i take blame for staying in the situation as long as I did . We should have left after the 45 minute wait when the dining room was not even full. But REALLY a manger who says he is too busy to talk to a customer. If he was too busy because he was doing the cooking, then ED the assistant manager who went to get MARTY this so called Senior Manager should have said that. Also , if MARTY (Senior Manager) is doing the cooking, please take him off the grill. Our food was not  good. I say worse then substandard. How hard is it to cook FRIDAYS food. We are not talking 5 star dining. I do expect decent customer service.

It always takes a long time get waited on in this Fridays. I'm not sure if it's a payroll issue or if they just can't keep staff. There was no host at the door and someone had to go fetch him. He came speeding back up but not without words to his Co worker about only being one person.  The plus to all of this is that the waiters and waitresses are very polite.

79,Randy K.,"Columbia, MD",1,8,,1.0,2015-06-15,"That moment when your neighbor says ""Sorry about that awful, awful experience."" as you're about to exit the car and trudge the last few steps to the culinary refuge that is your home - that was this afternoon's lunch experience. We arrived at 12:15pm on a Monday afternoon. There were three adults in our party and a reasonably adorable 7 month old girl who was not going to perusing the menu.  There were about 6 other parties seated in the restaurant. After 7 minutes or so, a server approached us. He took our order and then the nightmare spiral began. This was easily the worst dining experience I've had out in the past three years. Now, to be honest, the following is all the whiny bitching of a comfortably well off person. But if you're considering going here - be warned. The following rant should be read in the tone of the guy at the gas station who warns the carload of partying teenagers NOT TO GO TO THE OLD WITHERS' PLACE!!!  My friends ordered an appetizer - it took 30 minutes for the appetizer to show up. As it was a relatively hot and humid day in Maryland where being outside is the rough equivalent of being on the roof of a panting dog's mouth, our drinks were already either going or gone. It took another 35 minutes for the entrees to show up. At some point in between sad emoticon 1 and sad emoticon 2, the server noticed that our drinks were flatlined and said he'd get us refills. Sadly, that was not to be.  Now, a moment here for those of you who don't have the experience of dining with even the most likable of infants - your meal is literally a race against time before the smiling cherub next to you turns into a Game of Thrones tyrant. If we'd been able to eat and roll, this review wouldn't ever see the light of day. But our time there to grab a quick lunch ran to two hours, with us reduced to gulping down the soggy ice cubes so that dehydration didn't claim us whilst trying desperately to keep our youngest member appeased. After we were done, it was another 15 minutes before we even saw our server. To be fair, at some point the number of other parties went up as high as 10 tables, but it looked like only one server was handling the entire dining room area. Never saw a manager, or you can believe that I would have said something, as one member of our group had to work an evening shift and wanted to grab a quick meal and nap before her 4pm shift.  The food was fine, although why it'd take a minimally occupied kitchen an hour to crank out two burgers and a chicken strip meal is not something I can explain. In short - TURN BACK!!! THERE'S STILL TIME TO GO SOMEWHERE, ANYWHERE ELSE!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbia?start=60,2.04,2.04,2.04,1.988,2.04

I had received coupons in the mail and my 2 friends and I decided to go there and enjoy a nice girls session. We usually order the pick 2 meals in which we all usually get spinach dip and cajun shrimp pasta because that is our favorite meal duos. Upon entering we found out that they no longer do these or the $10 endless appetizers, no biggie we ordered the same regular items off the new menus in which they give smaller portions but for a cheaper amount which is really good to help portion meals and reduce issues such as obesity. This was actually ideal for us all because we were embracing a healthier lifestyle. When paying for our orders we asked if we can use the coupon and our waitress, Jereen, stated she could check but doesn't believe it would work and if it did she would have to individually write out receipts (which seemed odd to me because I have used coupons here before and never had that issue). We recognized that one of the coupons would work and qualified due to us paying regular price for one of the appetizers and Jereen did not seem as if she had any interest in reprinting receipts with new prices or asking a manager if it could be done as she had an obvious attitude. After collecting our credit cards she had asked us if we would also like ""To-Go Cups for your waters""...at this point we all realized this was a smart remark as we said ""no thank you"" she smirked and said ""okay have a great year god bless"" and walked away. Our waters were fully empty and she never bothered to give us a refill which is another trigger to us that she was purposely being rude. This was EXTREMELY rude.

I had to take small pieces of the cheese to eat so my fam didn't have to perform the Heimlich on me. I know it was full of sodium because l could feel my pressure rising with each spoonful of that glorious oniony broth, but since l don't eat this sort of stuff on the regular, l was ok.

So it was kinda disappointing. Never the less, we tried almost all of them, I guess it was about 6 to 7 different appetizer. Our favorite one was flat bread pizza. It was so delicious , we literally ordered it at least 3 more times. Most disappointing was the pork pot sticker. I love pork, so I was really looking forward to trying out their pork stickers but it did not live up to it's standards. Hence, I had to chastise them for this reason.

There was a slight odor about the place, as if the floors had been mopped with dirty water.  There was a ""dated"" vibe.  My wife commented that the place certainly wasn't ""happening.""

That said, the food was a plus.  I found the black bean burger to be well-topped with condiments and cheese, and the fries came out relatively hot.  My wife liked her salad, and our kids liked their kids meals.  Portion size was adequate but not impressive.

There was absolutely no reason to have me on hold because they weren't busy I was sitting outside of the restaurant in my car!! So I go in to pick up my food, the host and the young lady that was at the host stand their conversation was more important then greeting me!!!! I tell them the name for my order and I also ask for a manager too because the TGIF app is giving me an error code that says ask my server for help. The manager Rob walks over to me and says ""your looking for me""? That is not how the manger of a restaurant should address a guest!!!! I begin to tell Rob about the issue that I'm having when the server that took my order (Owen) walks up puts my order down and starts chit chatting with the host plus the other girl that was at the host stand. Rob tells me that there isn't much that he can really do, maybe I should try and log in from TGIF website instead of the app. I try to log in from the website and I got an error code from them as well, I show it to Rob and he says that he can't do anything without a code to redeem. Then he tells me to call TGIF 800 number, now the three employees that are at the host stand whispering back and forth about me like I can't see or hear them!!!! I call the 800 number only to be redirected back to the website to resolve my issue, I put my phone on speaker so Rob can hear it and he tells me that he can't do anything!!!!! Now the three employees at the host stand are trying to decide on which one of them are getting the food because I wasn't!!!! Only after telling Rob that I was calling corporate about this was he more sympathetic but still unwilling to help me figure this out!!! I spend hundreds of dollars at this restaurant every month and this is why I have these rewards points but after tonight they can have their reward points because I will NEVER spend another dollar at TGIF!!! I suggest that you don't either!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbia,1.76,2.05,2.05,,1.934
11,Licha D.,"District Heights, MD",96,4,7.0,2.0,2017-11-12,"Ok keep in mind this ain't fine dining, however I've never been so f'n grossed out by a bartender in my life. I would expect a male bartender to be slightly unsanitary but I've seen stray dogs in a trailer park with more cleanliness then the lady who couldn't get me a water with lemon on the side. She argued me down and told me that I asked her to squeeze 2 lemons in my water  (where they do that at?) Then I watched her scratch the bare skin on her belly and her back while she took our order. It was bad enough that her belly was even showing but even worst that she chewed on her finger nails every time she needed to think about something . She finally wanted to bring my lemon on the side so she went to kitchen and brought out a bare fist full of lemon like she was in her personal kitchen and tried to put it in a cup and bring it to the table""GIRL I SEE YOU! Take it back!!"" Then she slammed the water down on the counter. I complained to the manager and a new server (Tasha, she works weekends ONLY ask for her) helped us out and she was great in giving her best effort in reviving the terrible experience me and my wife had. Shout out to you! But all in all, stay the hell outta the bar at fridays in Columbia. Tasha got them 2 stars woulda been no stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbia,1.8,2.06,2.06,,1.956

8,Ann N.,"Baltimore, MD",0,5,,5.0,2017-12-18,"Recently gave this place another try and all I can say is wow!!! Huge difference, my waiter was engaged and personable, food was fast and picture perfect and met the new general manager. She seemed very sincere and really involved with the staff. We will be back soon and look forward to seeing more positivity since the manager said she just transferred to this location. Thumbs up fridays! Now if you had a sign showing people you are all the way back there it would be even better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbia,1.96,2.09,2.09,,2.0380000000000003
1,Jerry O.,"Riverview, FL",9,2,,1.0,2017-12-30,TGIFaildays Can't comment much beyond my family and I sat in a half full restaurant for 15 minutes and were not even acknowledged. Mentioned to the hostess on our way out that no one ever came to our table... no reaction at all to my complaint. AVOID AT ALL COST.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbia,1.96,2.09,2.09,,2.0380000000000003

The service is horrible, they charged us for two extra drinks and didn't even want to take it off. The server was extremely disrespectful her name is cat. She told us she was going to get the manager and the manger Corey wasn't helpful. Never coming here again such a disappointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbia,1.96,2.07,2.07,,2.0260000000000002
