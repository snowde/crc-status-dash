1,Courtney W.,"Daytona Beach, FL",50,337,195.0,2.0,2013-02-15,"First time sitting in the dining room at this location. I didn't like it. The set up was nice and it all looked like a Fridays, but the wait staff threw me off. Back home, Fridays is known for their drinks but the prices in NJ are higher then they are in Columbus. I wasn't expecting them to have the same prices. Expect your drinks to cost $10 each. A cheap drink here is around $8 or $9.  The food at this location isn't what I remember. The chicken wings, something I used to get all the time in college, were dry and bland; only thing I tasted was ""hot"". The potstickers were pretty bad too. It's such a shame, like I said, I used to love Fridays but this location has me wishing I was back home. Seems this place just cant cook. I got the fried shrimp which gives you a lot of food for the money. The shrimp had this weird off flavor to it, similar to when the shrimp aren't cleaned first which was surprising since I thought these were frozen and just baked. I don't have a lot fo expectations for Fridays so I tend to judge them higher automatically since this was my hang out in College. But this location just isn't worth going to, esp since the prices are so much higher then what I'm used to seeing out here.  Past experiences here would leave me never ordering anything aside from app's, cocktails, and burgers. With prices high on drinks and the apps being bland, and a recent change in only serving well done burgers I cant see myself coming back here.  I think the only reason I gave them such a high review last time was I came with a buzz already. I don't tend to see price signs when Ive been drinking lol. they do have a really cool bar though",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-2?start=40,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003

We had out 16 month old son with us, & they don't make booster seats high enough to accommodate the pub height tables that are in the bar. - 1 star. Then service was just blah. Could've been better. The server made sure to tell us non of our drinks came with free refills, even my sons' apple juice. Really? We're paying close to $100 when this is all said & done & we can't get a refill on an infants apple juice? That's just irritating. Also the place was empty, but they sat us at some funky round table.

I got the ribs, plus a Caesar salad to try to at least look healthy.  The salad was good- they pointed out that the dressing was more a vinaigrette than the typical creamy one, and it was fine.  The veggies were fresh. The ribs came, and had good fries and excellent slaw on the side.  So, more health food!  I tried the bacon-topped ribs, the chipotle, and the Memphis dry rub.  I was prepared to be disappointed- but they weren't bad.  Oh, not great, but there was some flavor in the meat itself, and the texture was about what I like- tender with a little pull.  The sauced ribs were oversauced, but in the case of the bacon ones I guess they need something to hold the pieces on.  And though I figured bacon on top of ribs would be overwhelmingly fatty, it worked fine.  Sort of the ultimate dry rub, savory and salty (okay, it wasn't dry with that sauce, but maybe you can see what I mean.) Service was very good.  The decor is fine, if forgettable.  Pricing was fair- $10 for about half a rack.  They're baby backs, though, so it's a small rack.  I won't be running back here, but if I'm with a group that just has to go, I'll be able to get something decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-2,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444

The waitress, maybe assuming I'm blind or possibly deaf, inappropriately complains to her coworker about her mistake, which was passed off on me...apparently adding goat cheese to a side salad is too complex for the staff here. Needless to say we won't be returning. I guess the 2.5 star rating should have been warning enough not to waste time and stick to my regular spot, BJs!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-2,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
37,K D.,"Whitewater, WI",1,66,33.0,5.0,2016-11-17,Love the bar staff here. So friendly and personable! They have great bar drink specials every day. Had the Jack Daniels ribeye and Jack Daniels chicken. Both were excellent!  The spinach side was perfectly seasoned.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-2,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
43,Oni W.,"Columbus, OH",0,28,3.0,1.0,2016-12-22,"Yup, this place sucks now. I havent been in for about 3 months, so I came in for the endless apps, which I looked up online to make sure it was going on before I made the trip here. Of course when I get ready to order, I'm notified they don't have it even though it's on their website. They got rid of my next selection, which was the reuben. I ended up ordering the full rack of ribs, which was more like a half rack if you were to order it anywhere else. The ribs came out semi warm. I had enough points for a free dessert, so I ordered the brownie obsession, which is now half the size it used to be. I should have gone to Makenzie River across the street instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-2,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
40,Bob D.,"Beavercreek, OH",1,16,4.0,5.0,2017-01-27,I have been here a few times and it has been lousy each time. Tonight however was great! William was my bartender and was excellent!

34,Tag T.,"Zanesville, OH",73,36,31.0,2.0,2017-02-25,"My first time eating at this location, food was pretty good, we both had the endless apps. Walked in at like 4pm on a Thursday and was told there would be a 15 minute wait when there was literally 40 tables open in the restaurant. Still not sure why. But we waited because we wanted the endless apps. Finally got seated at a table that had been open the whole time we waited. Server was pretty good and food was too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-2,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
39,Jeff G.,"Columbus, OH",0,14,1.0,2.0,2017-03-17,"Came in 6:30 on a Thursday, pretty slow. We were immediately seated and ordered our food. Salads came out after 15 minutes, definitely a rip off for $3.50, very little salad, wilted lettuce,and they were out of half there salad dressings. Food took about 30 minutes total with a 1/4 of the restaurant full. All of this with the server not checking in or even asking how the salads were. The food wasn't great either. Definite waste of money and will not be coming back. No manager in site.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-2,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
