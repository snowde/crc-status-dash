38,Isiah O.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,6,,4.0,2012-11-09,"I've been to a couple of TGI Fridays and I just have to say it's not my type of place. However, I was visiting Columbus with a good friend and TGI Fridays seemed like the best choice at the time because we weren't familiar with the area. This TGI Fridays was awesome. The server, Justin, was super impressive. He was seemingly the only waiter on staff at the time and you would've never known. He was super attentive and my glass of water was never empty. Our food was delivered prompty and he was always super nice, courteous and professional. The food itself was actually really decent for a TGI Fridays. I ordered a steak and lobster tell and both were pretty tasty. It's probably the first time I'd ever been impressed by a TGI's.

44,Gigi G.,"Orlando, FL",185,44,5.0,1.0,2013-02-08,"I've been several times to TGI Fridays and it's definitely not my first choice. I usually try to avoid it. The food is not to my taste and some is usually tasteless. Service is ok, but the food is never good when I go. I've tried several plates just to see if it's what I got the last time that wasn't good; I'm sorry to say that it's the food in general. On another occasion, I visited with my family and the food again was not to standards. It was cold and it tasted bland. We asked the server to notify the chef so that they can make changes and she was really rude. She took it personally and back-talked with an attitude when it wasn't directed to her in the first place. They can do a lot of things to fix this. I would suggest a major monthly training to start fixing things now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-4?start=40,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002

35,Kevin H.,"Fort Mitchell, AL",86,13,4.0,5.0,2013-11-24,Al and I had wonderful experience today at tgi fridays. was very quiet as the lunch crowd had left. wait staff was attentive and food presentation was superb. we had pot stickers for starters and the flavors were out of this world. the whole theme of the day was flavor. so many unique flavors that really worked. I had ribeye with lobster potato wedges and a lime jasmine slaw. the ribeye was ordered medium but came well done which was the only thing disappointment. the slaw was great. something I had never had before as it was not mayo based. everything else was amazing. Al commented that they did a balsamic vinegar reduction with the beef skewers that she really liked and those pork tacos were superb! I am impressed with the new menu and will think differently about tgi fridays after today.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-4?start=20,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998

26,Mac P.,"Stroudsburg, PA",0,8,,1.0,2014-09-05,"One of the worst experiences I've ever had. The staff is incompetent. First, we ordered mash potatoes but instead got these nasty parm fries---though I didn't know it was possible to screw up french fries (they were so, so gross) we let it go. I ordered a medium rare steak and mine was well done. It took over 15 mins to get a new steak---whatever.  What was awful was the fact the server knew it was taking too long so he avoided our table. The manager was schmoozing with a table of five women while this was going on, once the women left he came over to our table and reluctantly asked about the steak, swiftly changing the topic to how amazing the mac and cheese was and basically telling us about his love affair with the mac and cheese... ignoring the uneaten fries on two plates and the steak on my plate. He walked away--and I said ""this is usually where they would comp something or offer dessert"" I think he may have heard me because he came back and offered the steak on the house.  So, then I get the bill, I had an additional steak on the bill that was supposed to be free from my stars and stripes points (I go to TGiFridays a lot, and usually have a decent experience) it wasn't... So the manager then takes my phone back to the register to apply the code, although the server---who was completely ignoring us at this point---had the code written down.... the manager comes back with my phone (why is it ok for him to take my $500 smart phone back to the kitchen???) and puts the phone and receipt on the table without a word. I pay with a giftcard, the server returns the receipt, similarly to the manager, without a word. The receipt didn't have my giftcard balance on it or a $0.00 signifying PAID. At this point I kind of gave up and told my boyfriend it was his turn. So he asks if we're good to go, the server coldly replies ""everything is paid for.""  We didn't have a tip option on the gift card, nor were we able to get service to get change for a tip. This server didn't really deserve a tip,  but considering the bad example of the manager, I don't totally blame him for being angry at the slow kitchen staff (who probably doesnt get much direction from this bad manager) and ultimately just shutting down... so I planned to give him a tip. Sorry you didn't get one, Kevin, and I'm also sorry you have an awful manager--I think his name is Richard.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-4?start=20,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052
37,Jess B.,"Atlanta, GA",2,69,30.0,1.0,2014-09-06,Nope. This was one of the worst and most overpriced experiences I've had eating out in a long time. First the table was dirty when we sat down. We had a rotation of around 4 servers taking care of us. My boyfriend asked for some limes for his beer- they brought out lemons. We asked for extra dressing which took about 10 minutes to come out. They forgot the topping for my salmon and that took about 15 minutes to come out. A manager never came over to apologize for the wait or forgotten items. My boyfriend and I had 2 drinks each and a meal and the bill was over 70 dollars. For that kind of money I would expect the order to be correct and any extras to come out in a timely manner. Hands down the worst. There are a ton of other restaurants in this area- don't waste your time or money here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-4?start=20,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052
34,Buck N.,"Fort Mitchell, AL",0,38,10.0,1.0,2014-09-06,I've been to this TGIF 3 times and this will be my last visit. Service was terrible every time. I was a bartender and server for a year so I know the difference between good and bad service. The last visit my girlfriend and I were sat at a dirty booth. I ordered a dos Equis with limes and had to ask for the limes again after getting the beer. My server brought back lemons on a hot plate and my girlfriends second drink came with limes so I knew they weren't out. Server put in the wrong order for my girlfriend and only an ounce of ranch with my wings. They brought more ranch with her original order 20min later along with the check. I've been to several other TGIF establishments and this one is nowhere near as good as any other I have been too. I don't recommend anyone eat or drink here. I give this restaurant 1 star because I can't give it 0. May god have mercy on your souls....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-4?start=20,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052

The restaurant is more open and brighter. We were seated immediately,  and our server, Daniell, arrived at table within minutes. She did an excellent job our entire visit. We both had the J.D. burger with fries. A basic lunch, but our favorite!  Both were cooked just as we requested. I have to admit, I have had bad experiences here in the past, but it seems they've made some positive changes.

Just from what I could see, there were 2 empty booths and 3 empty tables. Nobody waiting inside or out, they told us a 25 minute wait. I asked to be seated as far from the smoking bar as possible (we had our child with us) and naturally, after 20 minutes, they sat us at the booth right next to the bar door. I asked for a high chair since my car seat wouldn't fit in the booth and they said it was a fire hazard and you can't have a highchair here.  Why the hell would you seat someone with a kid where you can't have a highchair?! Or right next to a door that is constantly opening and closing with smoke billowing in and out?! Ridiculous. We started our meal with a drink from the bar and some appetizers. The appetizers were good, no complaints there. My husband and I like to try 1 signature drink everywhere we go, so I got some type of strawberry mule/ginger type drink. Ginger can be done well in mixed drinks as a subtle flavor but I could smell the ginger from this drink before the waiter even set it down. I couldn't drink it, absolutely nasty and the waiter didn't have a thing to say, just took it away and didn't offer a sorry or anything.

I went across the street to  Chili's and they were able to clean tables and have us seated in less than 15 minutes. We received GREAT service and food at Chili's. This was my granddaughters 17th birthday dinner with family and friends and while Friday's did everything they could to spoil it for her and the rest if us, Chili's did everything they could to make great memories for her.

12,Christie S.,"Madison, WI",30,11,1.0,1.0,2016-11-01,"Wow.  We have tried to give this place a chance and have eaten here several times.  They consistently mess up the orders by bringing the wrong items, usually cold.  Tonight a bartender, I think his name was Allen, tall, lanky guy with brown fuu-fuu hair, first ignored my request for silverware and waited for the other bartender to get it, and then argued with us about the beer they had served, incorrectly.  Yes, that's right, they served us the incorrect draft beer and wouldn't admit it.  I'm from Wisconsin, what can I say, we know our beer, especially when you're served a fruity dark concoction and not the light, lager that was ordered.  Holy cats, wrong orders and ice cold food is one thing, a patronizingly stubborn server is another.  Allen, learn your beer.

14,Virak I.,"West Warwick, RI",0,4,,1.0,2016-11-01,"My family and I are a big fans of TGIF up in New England area (RI), never ever been disappointed before until we went to this one (Columbus GA, Whisttesey Blvd). Our waitress was nice and courteous, except our food, it was dry, no flavor or taste and over sauce. My nephew ordered NY strip & shrimps which come with two sides (fries, very very salty and mac n cheese, he even notice, pasta was hard. My baby back ribs was very dry. We could've walk over to Longhorn or gone to Smokey Bones like we'd planned and probably enjoy a better meal. After this experience, don't think I'll be going to TGIF for awhile. I was very upset as we left, didnt want to make fuss or cause a scene. Rather, got back to hotel room and express my experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-4,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36

I guess when my wife turns 25 and her license expires, she will get a new one so we can drink at TGFI! The food was good, but they're really slow.

8,Marcus T.,"Fort Benning, GA",6,3,1.0,1.0,2017-03-04,Had one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a TGIF.  We had only four people who ordered food and three out of four had their orders messed up. They brought food to the table and we had no utensils and they walked off before we could say anything so we had to wait until someone came around to ask for silverware.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-4,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
10,Lisa B.,"Columbus, GA",75,17,2.0,5.0,2017-03-28,I love this place. I always go to the bar area due to I am a smoker and enjoy one after I eat. The live music is amazing! People are great. I am always greeted with a smile and that's the number one thing I look for in somewhere to eat if the people are nice and smile no matter what they have going on I'll always return.

9,Christina C.,"Phenix City, AL",38,9,2.0,3.0,2017-04-10,"Bryan was our server and he was amazing, BUT so over stretched. He worked a HUGE area so service was very slow. We sat at our table for over ten minutes before our drink order was even taken. We got the endless apps which were good for the most part, but the pot stickers were obviously baked and not prepared correctly, which is a shame since they are my favorite. The best part of the meal for me was the Long Island Hard Tea and the Tennessee Whisky cake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-4,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16

They didn't have almost everything we wanted to order, then they messed up half of it and the other half had to be sent back because it wasn't good.

It wasn't crowded at all, the waitress was nice. The food was super good! I had the Cajun pasta and my husband had the burger with the two wings on top of it. Our waitress asked us if we were a stripes member (we were totally lost lol) but then she explained it to us and we remembered to download the app for this 2nd time around. This 2nd time I got the same thing, and my husband got the BBQ chicken salad and our son got the chicken fingers from the kids menu. Everything was delicious! I had the pink punk martini, my husband had Samuel Adams draft beer and our son had the blue raspberry slushee. Our waitress was very nice she checked on us to make sure we were ok and if our food/drinks were ok as well. We used our TGIF app (yay) this time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-4,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
11,Kelsey M.,"Midland, GA",113,2,,1.0,2017-06-24,"If I could give this place no stars I would. First of all, a 20 minute wait turned into a 40 minute wait. Okay, that's not always in their control. When we were finally seated, we all ordered waters and it took over ten minutes for them to bring it to us. The waitress didn't know the menu and couldn't explain an item to my cousin. They were also out of coke. When our food finally came, all the burgers and steaks were over cooked, my cousin didn't receive the wings he asked for, my mom didn't receive the sauce she asked for, and we had no silverware. For everything wrong, the waitress said she told them and she wasn't sure why things were wrong. When we asked for silverware, the waitress said we either had to wait for her to roll some or that we could have plastic forks. My cousin ordered her steak medium and it came out well done with a ""medium well"" stick in it. The waitress said that they had put the second steak on the ticket, but The manager decided they didn't have to pay for the first one. THEY WERE GOING TO CHARGE THEM FOR TWO STEAKS!! This entire time it had been a game of telephone between us, the waitress, and the manager since the manager wouldn't come out. It took 15-20 minutes to get the To go steak. We received the bill and were told that the manager said they couldn't give the military discount because the steak was comped. We finally had to ask the manager to come out since she was in the back and wouldn't come out. When she finally appeared, she was rude and dismissive. She said she hadn't come out throughout this entire ordeal because she was ""watching the steak."" For twenty minutes? It took so long because the kitchen was ""backed up?"" No, I'm sorry. As someone who works in customer service, you come out, apologize, and fix it. When asked about the military discount, the manager claimed she had never said that it was policy. She threw the poor waitress under the bus! I can promise you that we're never eating here again. I've never been so pissed off that I felt the need to write a review. We were told the names of the managers there that night were ashley and Judy. Absolutely horrible customer service and disrespectful to our military.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-4,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12

2,Donald T.,"Columbus, GA",0,1,,2.0,2017-09-15,"My wife and I came here on our first night out in months. Waited to be seated because the place was packed. We ordered drinks and endless apps; but had our app orders mixed up, not to mention having food arrive to our table before our drinks or flatware.  However, this was far from the worst part of the experience as a few minutes into our meal the 'dj' started blaring his music across the restaurant. I had to lean across the table to even hear my wife, much less be able to hold a conversation. When we raised our concerns to the waitress about it, she said she didn't even know why he was there because he shouldn't be, but there was nothing they could do.  After giving this DJ about ten or fifteen minutes to adjust the sound levels, we decided to follow the lead of three other tables in our area and get our check early so that we could leave as soon as possible. Although we weren't charged for the drink we hadn't received yet, no attempt to make up for our experience was made either.  We left hungry and dissatisfied to go to another restaurant down the road to finish our night out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-4,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08

1,Audrie C.,"Columbus, GA",0,1,,1.0,2018-01-13,"Before I explain our experience, I want to say I am appreciative of and have respect for servers; being that I have been in their shoes at one point in time. But this was horrible service. We showed up for dinner, and never got to place my order. We sat for over 15 minutes without anyone coming to our table to at least take our drink order. There was a waitress tending to the table beside us, asking if they were needing anything and then just walked away afterwards. Five minutes later, the waiter from the other table beside us finally came towards us threw some napkins and straws in front of us, then asked us to wait. No introduction, no ""hello, I'll be your server..."",  no ""please give me a few minutes to get your order..."" NOTHING. And walks away... I then became a tad bit frustrated and proceed to ask the hostess if she could have someone take our order. She then comes to the table and practically responses very rudely with attitude; and gives up excuses for the services. Telling us to wait because they only have one waiter, when we obviously saw more than one! The server could have at least took our drink order or explained that he needed a few more minutes to get to us! Courtesy goes a long way! We felt greatly disrespected and ignored. NEVER GO THERE, unless you want to be subjected to this type of service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-4,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
