Food was great , but service is horrendous ! We had to wait half an hour for the food, and the server was by the name Carney.  Poor hospitality skills , and showed no motivation when servicing us.  Acted almost like he didn't care about our service. The worst part was asking for our bill. It took half an-hour to get our bill, and we we did get it, we were billed wrong. We did the 2 for $10 special. Instead of giving us 2 for $10, we were billed for each item individually, and had requested it get corrected. That took another whole long time. At any rate, the food is great! It's a nice place to come to for food, but service is horrible. You also risk getting your appetizers being cold, due to the lack of skill the servers have. (My french fries were cold, but I didn't complain.) Go to a different TGIF, or go to the Ono BQQ right across the street. You'll be stuck here in this place for over an hour due to their services.

300,Roy Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,8,3.0,1.0,2012-06-03,"Went here last Friday around 5pm.  Initial Reactions: Restaurant was easy to find, parking was a little weird, but free and the front of house was polite and quickly sat the both of us. The restaurant was clean, the bar was busy, but the rest of the restaurant was not very busy. I'd say 30-40% full. Time: 10 mins since seating. NO SERVER APPROACHES US. I had to finally ask someone to serve us and they hesitantly did so only after ""checking for our server"". He did not know the details of the drinks, even asking us to point to the drinks we were referring to. The order was not complicated, but he didn't seem to understand my questions or the substitution requests I was making. 30 mins since seating. We get our drinks. A full 20 minutes AFTER we order it. I get it. The bar is busy, but seriously. The real server also appears and apologizes, saying he just got on shift and no one told him that he had a table already, even though he many other fellow servers passing our table seemingly ignoring us. 35 mins since seating a liquid explodes from the bus boy station near us. I'm not sure what that area is used for , but  It looks like a bus boy station so I'm worried that this massive explosion of liquid is dirty water or something worse. The hot liquid splatters over my table and three other tables. Two families near us are also startled by it. The employee in the bus boy station sees me literally wiping myself after the explosion he caused and quickly leaves the station. Two other serves pass me, not noticing their customers cleaning their respective tables.  I had to call for a supervisor. I point to the splattered liquid on the floor, the windows of the bus boy station and the tables. He apologizes and says he will find out what the liquid was.  5 minutes later, he says it's water and instructs his employees to clean the bus boy station. Bus boy station clean now. Customer tables and customers not. I think he realizes this so he says he will get me something to wipe myself with. 5 minutes later he comes back. No joke.  40 min since seating. By now you must be wondering how I can be so accurate about  the time since we sat... that's because I've been checking my watch constantly. We have not received the two appetizers we had ordered (drum roll) till now. Two appetizers.  We had finished our drinks by then so I ordered another round of drinks. In closing. We got our second drinks AFTER we finished our appetizers. So it gave us enough time to think about what type of tip we should leave. The manager comes and says the appetizers were on the house because of the earlier incident with the hot water, which was a nice gesture. We were in a rush since this quick meal turned out to be nearly a two hour ordeal, so we paid the bill and left.  The only problem was they didn't leave the credit card with the bill. We didn't realize they didn't give us back our credit card until the next day. We had to drive back to this hell hole to pick it up...

Host said, we had to wait for 15 minutes- I was about to leave when he said let me check and sat us. For about 30 minutes no one came to the table to say hello.  Finally the host came back and said, sorry your server is busy can I get you a drink? I ordered water for my daughter and I, plus I requested on of the Cognac from their menu. He came back with Cognac on the Rocks. I told him that I didn't order on the rocks, he took the drink and came back few minutes later. I noticed he didn't get me new drink instead removed the ice-- so now I had water-down version of COLD cognac. LoL 40 minutes of miserable  moments I couldn't even get the right drink??????? I asked to speak to their manager.  Manager comes to the table, I said my peace (very respectfully)......he apologized and brought me fresh cognac. After he left I was going to take a sip but noticed glass was filthy - freaking nasty dirty glass and cognac all around the outside. This time I didn't say a word but didn't bother taking a sip.  My food was served, I asked the food runner-- thank but my main reason for the visit was my daughter and her dessert. He said, it's on its way.......... we waited another 30 minutes couldn't get dessert.  I was done with my food..........finally waiter comes to the table apologized for falling behind service. I asked for dessert again- finally got dessert. The only thing they serve me ontime was my check. LoL  Check I looked at had ""owners discount"" 50%...........whatever that means.......i can careless about the discounts - even if it was free I would never visit this place again.

I again asked the server after we tasted it if there was any way she could see if it was correct, she said she would bring me some cajun butter and I mix it and that might be all that is missing.

THEREFORE you should PREPARE for BUSY weekends.  Sort of given.    So I met a friend here and he was already at the bar.  When I walk in he goes out to the car quickly and in the meantime this lady comes around asking did you order these wings?  I tell her I'm not sure, I just got here and maybe my friend did.  She says okay and stands there until my friend comes back.  Welp that wasn't our order.  Whoever got those wings had some cooling off HOT wings as plenty of people passed that plate.  So I figured it was a fluke.  We ordered wings to start, and again here comes the same lady stopping with our plate at EVERY table around the bar and every bar stool to ask, ""Did you order wings""  This basically went on the entire time we were here.  So REALLY being busy equates NOT knowing WHO to give orders to?  so I could have taken the wings and happily ate them without anyone knowing.   the LAST straw was when my friend asked for a plate the waitress had the NERVE to say ""WHAT?!""  wow.  so ""WHAT?!"" is how you answer customers who say ""Excuse me can I get a plate for the bones""   The FOOD is was VERY good...including my salad...but who KNOWS how many people breathed ALL over it before it got to me.   geesh",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-compton?start=140,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.024,2.32

Let's dive into some details. Service was awesome!  Our waiter was on the ball.  Always checking on us, making sure we were happy.  Quick and reliable.  The problem was that the kitchen couldn't seem to do anything right, and apparently the bar wasn't far behind. We ordered during happy hour, so that entailed appetizers and drinks only since they're 1/2 price.  Our order covered the following:  2 sets of buffalo wings in Jack Daniels sauce with extra sauce on the side...  2 orders of pot stickers.  And a long island iced tea.   First to arrive.  An oddly colored long island.  Tasted strange.  Oh, but the glass had a vertical shatter in it that would have split wide open should we bumped it against the table hard enough.  He gladly took it back for a new drink, but I think the bar just poured it into a new glass and put some ice in it. Second was the food.  Pot stickers came with no dipping sauce at all.  And the wings came out looking particularly undercooked and strangely different amongst the 2 orders.  We quickly determined they forgot all sauces, and one was in Jack Daniels sauce, while the other was in BBQ sauce.  Waiter was quick to fix these issues. Manager was quick to discount.  But my problem lies here:  2 different visits.  2 sets of disasters.   I've been to multiple TGI Fridays and never had trouble, but this one has struck out twice.  Hard to not notice.

And we ""needed"" to be patient and not ""complain"" because they are busy (which they weren't to my standards, just understaffed) Ok of course that's great, speed things up a bit... However we never ever saw him again!!! The partner was the only one helping us and she seemed in way over her head. Needless to say it took 30 mins to receive our drinks after ordering, and another 45 mins. to receive our appetizers... Oookkk now the fun part. After she single handedly took our order (of course things were bound to be wrong) we never had the chance to ask for refills because she was so busy just trying to keep her head on. So now yet another 45 mins. had gone by and most everyone's food started pouring out, well ok except we still had 2 ppl not receive their apps. The food was COLD!!! Like they prepared them one by one and sat them on the counter until all food was done, and I'm talking about fries here (which were virtually inedible seeing as they were too cold to swallow). At this point we asked the waitress to halt, and just get the manager because things were not salvageable. So from here on the manager was our waitress but was polite but not very apologetic.

The return visit was about the same.  History. When they built this in Compton, it automatically became the hottest place to go. We don't have glitzy places to eat here unfortunately. This was it. I know, I know GLITZY!, Yes. This is as glitzy as it get around here. lol. We came a couple of weeks after it opened and one of our VP took a bunch of us to lunch here. We were served small portions with a big price tags and the food was nothing to write home about. When everyone got their food, the overwhelming comments was ""Where's the rest of the food"". Needless to say, that meal was very disappointing and I've never returned since, until now. I talked my co-worker into coming along and try it again 6 years later (He did not want to go lol). Did they improve? Not really. When we arrived, we asked for a table. We were strongly encouraged by the host to go to the bar area instead. She hinted there was a 10 minute wait for a table, while at the bar area, there was no waiting time. It's 2:30 pm and you're telling me there is a 10 minute wait for a table? Nobody before us and nobody behind us. The bar area was half full. Not a lot of cars in the parking lot. I think not. Okay, bar it was. The bar is nicely decorated. 3 big flat screens on one side of the bar. The bar itself was U shaped and very big. Half booths on on side and high tables everywhere else. We both order the Jack Daniel's Burger ""Signature Jack Daniel's sauce, apple wood smoked bacon and melted provolone cheese"" I upgraded my fries to sweet potato fries for an additional $1.79. The burger was cooked to medium as requested and was just okay. The bacon didn't have a lot of smokiness to them. The JD sauce was way too sweet. Thank goodness they put it on the side. Sweet potatoes were perfect. Service was on the slow, slow side. It took a long time for refills and the check to come. Friendly, but I could see her on the far end of the bar talking to the bartender and she took her time doing her rounds. Price: This place is over priced. The only thing reasonable were the burgers.  It looks like it's going to be another few years before I return (if ever). My co-worker's parting words to me.

I gave my card right away and she came back. We didn't tip.  The food seemed like moments ago it was frozen. And to make it all worse, we ordered the full rack of ribs. The waitress said we got three sides, but later came back and told us that she messed up and we only actually get two. She said that she had taken the liberty to choose two out of three we told her and said she hopes it is okay. What. She just chose what we should eat? I told her that was not okay and so I re-chose our sides. Moments later a different waitress is coming towards us with a plate of ribs but our waitress intercepts her and makes her take it back to the kitchen. Then it took 10+ mins for us to get our food.

My burger came out without bacon, mushrooms and the garlic aioli that's supposed to be on it. I didn't order with any modifications to the burger. When I questioned our server Andrea about the items left off of the burger she told me that wasn't the burger I ordered. I then asked for a menu so I could make sure I wasn't mistaken. I had to remind her I asked for a menu and when she did bring it her attitude was less than desirable. Andrea never offered refills, extra napkins and just never came to check on us in general. She had a very nonchalant attitude during the entire time. We actually asked for another server. One of my friends never received the salad she ordered.

Even the managers clearly stood out and joined the circle and were just talking. There was easily at least 10 employees standing by the bar just gossiping. Not to mention, one of them burped so loud I would assume half of the bar heard. The security guard, instead of doing his job was sitting at a table hitting on girls. Everyone just looked pissed off and like they hated their job, which made me hate my life. We sat at the table for 15 mins and no one acknowledged us.

I told the waitress I dident want that beer and said that I would like a beer in a bottle so I can finish my food. She brings me a Stella cider.  I told her I orderd a beer. I finished my ribs without anything to drink. And when I was done she brought me a Budweiser. At that time I was already done with my food.

So after 30 minutes of no type of service we left.

234,Tiana T.,"El Segundo, CA",0,15,11.0,2.0,2015-09-28,This is by far the most ghetto unprofessional restaurant I've ever walked into. You might as well treat this as a bar ONLY because that's where most of their employees dedicate their time . The restaurant side is abandoned and gets less than exceptional service IF ANY. I waited on the server for ten minutes before I was asked what would I like to drink .. I went to the restaurant around 9:30PMish on a Sunday and ONLY the bar was packed. The restaurant itself was empty. The employees have no discretion on how they speak or even what they say in front of customers. I heard more than I needed to hear about their personal lives and I was honestly shocked at how loosely profanity was used.(We all curse ... but most of us not at work) The server was strange and had spit bubbles in her mouth (which is not something I am blaming her for it could have been uncontrollable nonetheless it made me a tad bit uncomfortable knowing she was handling my food) My food came out wrong so I had to send it back and the restaurant and service was pretty bad to the point I just wanted leave .. so I didn't even ask for it to be replaced I just ended up not eating. I did have a drink (Lemon Drop) and the drinks here are REALLY good and pretty strong and that is why I gave them two stars. For my drink.

The length of time to be seated from when he arrived was 15 minutes.  So I don't understand why we had to wait a total of 25 minutes just to be seated when tables were abundant.  We were seated just off the bar area, go figure!  Service in this area is lacking and the staff is more concerned of the sporting event that's on tv rather than  the people who are there to ultimately pay their bills.  Good service equals better tips! The Jack Daniels burger was a winner, no problems in that area.  A+ for the food taste.  C+ for service. We've been here several times and each time is a little different.  Overall I believe the staff is good, food is good and prices are good.  Everyone means well but I think management should get involved and advise the staff one important factor.  Happy satisfied customers = return business, word of mouth compliments, and nice tips.  More people coming into the front doors means bigger profits for the business and essentially more money for the staff!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-compton?start=60,2.04,1.7,1.7,1.252,1.836

The problem is the service at this TGIF. At first it was good but I'd say after 10 minutes it went downhill. Waitress brought our drinks, no straws. Asked for straws and it took 5 minutes to get them. We had to ask another person to get them for us. We ordered our appetizers & we asked if they were going to come out before our food she said yes. The appetizers and our food came out at the same time. We didn't get all the appetizers we ordered so we waited to see if they were going to bring them out. Nothing. My sister finished her food so we asked about our 2 other appetizers & they said, ""oh I was suppose to come tell you that we have no more crispy green beans fries."" Which she didn't until then, so we were waiting on the spinach dip. Came back and told us that they ran out of that too. So I'm getting ready to eat my Sicilian Stacked Burger & it was wrong. I got that burger because of the spicy vegetables, there were no type of vegetables in it. Just the patties & cheese. So they had to take that back & cook another burger. We wanted to order another appetizer while we waited for my burger. No one came back to our table. So we sat & waited. She came with our burger & another burger that we did not order. Told the waitress we didn't order it, she said shhhhh & left it at our table. We still wanted to order an appetizer but she had dropped off the burgers & left.

131,Jessica R.,"Long Beach, CA",26,6,2.0,1.0,2016-03-17,This place has the WORST service ever. I always come to this location bcs it is so close to my job. Unfortunately the bartenders do not even acknowledge you when you come in. I was sitting there for about 10 min with no acknowledgments or menus. Two other couples walked in after me and before they can even sit down they had menus in front of them. This is absolutely the worst place ever if they do not want to give me service then I'll take my business elsewhere. When I usually go to  places like TGI Fridays I ALWAYS try to tip the bartender well. At least 20% of my bill for their hard work. Apparently that is not good enough for them. I can guarantee that I will never ever set foot in this TGI Fridays. I will also make sure to let all my friends and colleagues know not to go to this place as they have bad service. Last but not least I would  also like to add that the bar area was not busy at all. I would say they had approximately eight customers.  It is unfortunate in today's day and age that an establishment of this nature in a chain like TGI Friday's is unable to provide equitable service to all customers.

139,Bree N.,"Riverside, CA",64,20,3.0,1.0,2016-11-06,"Went here with my best friend for the happy hour and sat at the bar. Immediately noticed that people next to us hadn't  touched their liquor, so I asked if the bartender was any good. She told me that they had returned all of their drinks and that the second round was no better. I opted to just get a Samuel Adams to be safe. My friend ordered the Long Island; when I asked the bartender to make it strong he informed me that they were premixed...gross. Even if that drink is on the happy hour menu, pre mixing it and making it weak is unacceptable. The beer selection on the happy hour is pitiful, the beer that's actually good will cost you $6.50 for a small. The food was THE WORST. We ordered off the 2 for $20 menu. The mozzarella sticks were okay, although I had to ask about three people to get me a side of ranch, and the plate was cold by the time I finally got it. I don't see how a manager could forget, usually they pay more than the usual attention to what customers request. We also got the chicken pasta...DISGUSTING. I knew from the moment the plate was put down that they need to fire their chef. There was bbq sauce on the chicken and the pasta was in a canned red sauce. It was the worst pasta I've ever had. I've been to other Friday's, and they make that dish really well, so this was honestly a surprise. I decided not to waste my time or any more money, so I got a hold of a manger at the front and asked for the check without the pasta. She didn't seem concerned at all that the dinner and service sucked, and almost looked annoyed that she'd even had to come up and talk to me. The hostess was way more apologetic. $17 wasted on bad service and worse food. If you're thinking about going to Friday's, go to a different one.

In the bar area, I grabbed us a table; we were there for drinks and appetizers, so I was not expecting a stellar dining experience - just food and fun. I got there first and ordered a drink, which came fast enough, and the staff was professional and polite.  Then, when I ordered a couple of appetizers, they neglected plates and flatware until I asked.  From that point, once my 3 friends arrived, service became worse; orders from the bar were delayed, food orders took almost 1 hour to receive.  Part of the problem, I believe, was that three different servers were involved, but none appeared to have spoken to each other about our requests. The point of stressing there were a total of 4 of us, is that had we been a party of 8 or 10, I could understand possible delay or confusion in serving us adequately.  But we were only 4 people, who ordered 4 appetizers, one entrée and drinks...yet service was lacking, food was delayed and at the end, there were mistakes on the bill.  Ultimately, it was a disappointing experience, and I will suggest somewhere else when my friends want to meet up again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-compton,1.28,1.62,1.7,1.9280000000000002,1.4840000000000002

Our food came out, about 20 min after we ordered. I noticed that they served me a full rack of ribs instead of the half rack + shrimp. I figured she made a mistake and just charged me for a full rack of ribs. I was hungry so we just went along eating. Still, no straws or cutlery but she came back and brought us ranch saying we asked for ranch. Once again, manager to the rescue and brought us some straws and cutlery.  About half an hour after that, our bill came and I'm charged for shrimp that I didn't even get! Manager came over and fixed it. All in all, I probably seen my server twice and the manager did her best to satisfy the customer at 3 different tables served by the same girl. Not the best customer service but the manager really went out of her way to keep the customers happy. Will I go back? Probably not",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-compton,1.32,1.63,1.688,1.8920000000000003,1.5060000000000002

I'm a very patient person, but her attitude was so offputting especially since we only sat down and didn't bother her to do her job; which I think she should have greeted and informed us about the wait. Then she looked like she went on her phone? Already off to a bad start.  She tells us to pick a seat, we do, and then our waiter comes to us, he's friendly enough but i see him really shine with other tables; we weren't getting the same service as them, I assume that he felt that a table with 3 would give less (of a tip) than a bigger table. Which is fair enough, but i shouldnt be able to feel that kind of dismissal. My friend ordered ribs, but they need to rename them for what they were, bones with bbq sauce... super overpriced for what she got. When we ordered desert we waited like 20 mins to get them! I had to ask hey... did you guys remember our desserts? ""Oh yeah there's a problem in the kitchen, they're coming out soon."" Why didn't they tell us?
