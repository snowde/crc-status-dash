15,Deren S.,"West Des Moines, IA",41,59,82.0,3.0,2012-11-14,cant go wrong with Jack Daniels sauce meals. Most of them are pretty good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-copley,,,,,
0,Randy T.,"Hackettstown, NJ",29,213,3.0,4.0,2013-01-08,"After having a terrible experience at a different restaurant and walking out I came here in hopes of getting a decent meal. And it was!! My server here was amazing. The manager was very attentive at the front of the restaurant and I made sure to tell him how great the service was today. I was also delighted to see some old familiar items on the menu. I have not been in a Friday's in probably 4 years or more, but the sight of the sizzling chicken brought back memories of my favorite dish. It was prepared perfectly. Also, they (like most casual dining restaurants) are on the pretzel and beer cheese kick, but the ones here were definitely better than some of the others I have tasted. Overall, I was very impressed with this place... if I was a local, I would probably frequent this place!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-copley,,,,,
16,Cameron C.,"Akron, OH",199,35,17.0,3.0,2013-01-29,"This place right here! Another one of my drunken adventures led my girlfriend and I here, and I can't say that it was a bad thing. Food was decent, on par with applebees and all those other places. People were super nice to us, or maybe I was too drunk to care? Or maybe it was because my girlfriend had a low cut shirt on.....whatevs, good service! I just wish they would've roofied me and said a few kind words before they f*cked me on the price! You would've thought I was eating gold plated, diamond encrusted baby dinosaur eggs or some shit. Geezus. Despite the price making me want to ask my boss for a raise, or rob a bank (sounds fun, actually....), the place was solid all the way around and I'd go back....and make somebody else pay for it! Anybody wanna give me their credit card number? Come onnnnn.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-copley,,,,,
11,Richard B.,"Akron, OH",25,202,,2.0,2014-07-12,"Ya know how when one gets a deli sandwich at a deli they pile  the meat two inches high or more n the center and the thickness drops to a millimeter or two around the edge, imparting a sense of over-abundance? Fridays took a page from that playbook with their new Reuben, but forgot the part where the meat's two inches high in the center.  It was two millimeters high under 60% of the bread and trailed off to nothing around the perimeter. To make one think there was actually a meal involved, they made it a triple-decker, and then piled one half-sandwich atop the other for an excellent presentation promising aplenty and if one planned to eat toast, supplying it as well.  If one actually expected a reasonable portion of protein, it was a no-show!   Opted for the steakhouse fries over the standard ones for an extra buck, cause it costs more to cut the potato in wedges than to cut it into fries  I guess. The other party's New Orleans shrimp and chicken dish was fine sans the several un-chew-able bits of connective tissue or silver skin that was left in the chicken breast medallions.  Service was quite good, but it seems that leaving one's ""Give Me Stripes"" card out on the table no longer automatically generates the complimentary chips and salsa, nor a query as to whether or not it is desired.  Oh well, no huge loss there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-copley,,,,,
7,Mark M.,"Valley City, OH",3,347,1.0,1.0,2014-07-27,"Very disappointed! After having a bad experience at the Westlake location we decided to give this location a try after they sent us a gift certificate.  It was not any better,.  TGI Fridays does not train their staff. First we where shown a table a the bar when the place was almost empty.  Are we being hidden away?  We were given a table only after asking. The server came write over and took our drink order and told us to try an item but did not explain it.  Drinks arrived and orders taken.   We opted for a small salad as a side dish.  It was a SMALL salad!  The main meal came and service when down hill after that.  The server or anyone else never picked up the salad dishes.  Those dishes sat on our table during the whole meal.  We never saw the server again until we asked for the bill.  We were never offered refills or asked if we needed anything else. The salmon and lobster dish was very small and not wroth the price.  The sweet potato fries where also small and cold. The other dish was a steak with what was supposed to be steak fries.  Instead they where jo-jos and they were cold. The host keep walking up and down the aisle with a dirty rag and never noticed used dishes still on the table.  We also observed that other tables still had dishes on the tables after the guests have left..  The place was not busy at all. When the server came over and we asked for the bill none of the dishes were removed.  Only after we paid did the server start to remove dishes. Sent a comment to TGI Fridays and did not receive a response. They don't care about training their staff or the customers.  The food is so-so.  There are too many other great restaurants to choose from than to bother with TGI Friday's again.

4,Dizzy D.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,95,14.0,1.0,2014-09-02,"Only came here because the kids needed something simple to eat. (Rokne's was closed.)  We asked if we could do plain noodles & meatballs and they said yes. It ended up costing $18.50 for that ONE kids meal (Plain spaghetti, no sauce, & 3 meatballs. They said they had to combine 2 adult meals to do it).  Wow.  The other kids meal was fine... $5 for a plain hamburger w/ a side oranges. And both kids had unlimited lemonade with the purchase of  the first glass, which was great My breaded Fridays shrimp were barely edible. I only ate them because I was starving.  The server was very friendly which was the upside.  Sorry thank god it's Fridays.... I'm praying to god I never have to visit you again. JUST PLAIN AWFUL  .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-copley,,,,,

13,Captain E. O.,"Tucson, AZ",0,44,1.0,1.0,2015-02-28,"Walking in, you can get a sense that you're not welcomed by the facts that it takes minutes to get someone's attention to sit, as well as no one is even in the business at all! Once we realized we were not allowed to share appetizers, the waitress assumed we would be a hassle and avoided our order, avoided bringing our food, and dropped off the check without any statement or compliment. The manager is a car salesman who pushes overpriced shit that's about to go bad. 2 beers on tap, 1 appetizer, and '3 for $15' entrees; all horrible.  In taste, price, speed, and portion.  $45 later, we walked about disappointed in the fact we just paid steakhouse prices for Applebees food microwaved twice. Don't do it, not worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-copley,,,,,
10,Inglish T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",142,126,26.0,1.0,2015-03-03,"Two times I've come here and it's always way too hot, we asked for a seat where the heat wasn't blowing down on us and the server suddenly became rude and frustrated I'm guessing thinking he wouldn't get us as a table but then he ended up still having us a customer, he was rude the whole time with a fake smile and put a damper on our dinner experience. This happened both times. Servers need to find some customer service skills.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-copley,,,,,
12,Heidi K.,"Cleveland, OH",0,3,,1.0,2015-03-08,We came during a late afternoon on a Sunday.  My sizzling plate was no longer sizzling and chicken and shrimp were well over cooked.  Service was slow and there were very few people in the restaurant.  The cost of the sub par food was much too expensive for the quality of food we received.  This will be my last visit.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-copley,,,,,
9,Darren H.,"Medina, OH",0,3,,1.0,2015-07-18,I took my two children to sample the $10 appetizer menu as advertised .... What a disappointment the boneless chicken wings were poor quality chicken nuggets..... I won't be returning for a long time...

6,John V.,"Atlanta, GA",3,29,4.0,2.0,2015-10-13,Not the cleanest or most friendly chain location I've been to. However as the saying goes you get what you pay for!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-copley,,,,,
5,Dave P.,"Akron, OH",0,21,3.0,3.0,2016-09-09,"Went here a few days ago only because we had a BOGO coupon. Hadn't been here in quite some time and never had any complaints. The parking lot was a bit deserted and the dining room was pretty empty. Seeing this, our expectations weren't real high. We both opted for strip steak combos, one with shrimp the other with ribs. The steaks were flavorful and cooked just right. The breaded shrimp were small, but also cooked right. The ribs were not real meaty, but tender and flavorful. Over all our meal was good, side dishes and all. The dining room and decor are looking quite tired and outdated. Will definitely put this back on our list of places to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-copley,,,,,
1,Kemuel J.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,16,3.0,1.0,2017-06-24,"This is the worst Friday's I've been to lol. Definitely go ANYWHERE else. I'd go to Applebee's before I came here again. Can't cook a steak or a burger to save their lives. If you order a medium rare steak, you'll receive it medium well. Your burger tastes like lump of charcoal, and they tell you it's ""meant to taste that way""... Gtfo lol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-copley,,,,,
3,Kieran O.,"Seville, OH",6,9,16.0,2.0,2017-06-27,"Whatsoever has happened to my T. G. I. Fridays? My goodness... We have been Fridays stalwarts for decades and while the chain has seen tough times we have stuck with them. However, the last three times we have chosen Fridays for our empty nest/disposable income nights out (full disclosure, one of the three was the Strongsville OH store) it has NOT been good. A few days ago, my wife's Pecan Crusted Chicken Salad was just some chicken on lettuce. Ya, just that. Since she orders it almost always, she saw right away it was missing everything else. Now, the bar guys were fantastic -- and made it right as immediately as they could and apologized ""up one side and down the other"" (as my Mom would say). But the damage is being done. I have 399 Fridays points and frankly, I feel like just deleting the app and starting my Burntwood Tavern Rewards. I am so sorry, Fridays, but I feel like some tough love is needed here. You suck right now and better get your sh** together or we are done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-copley,,,,,
2,Feronach ..,"Rittman, OH",0,3,,1.0,2017-07-01,"Firstly, they are obviously understaffed. The servers are so busy we had three separate people bringing us the food. Two of our party ordered medium rare burgers, which came out medium well. Multiple sides appeared to vegan for the non-meat eater in the party, however both the potatoes and the steamed spinach were covered in cheese. To top it off, it took more than 15 minutes to return our cards AFTER paying for the meal. The servers we had were nice and good at their jobs, so its a shame that the workers in the back would give such a sub-par experience to us. 2/10",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-copley,,,,,
