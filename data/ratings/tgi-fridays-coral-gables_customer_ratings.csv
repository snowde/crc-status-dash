74,Kimberly O.,"Somerville, MA",39,21,1.0,1.0,2012-01-07,"I've been to Friday's all over the eastern seaboard and have had meh-to-WOW experiences at each location. Never have I had such a poor experience as I did at the one in the Gables. Ever order a cocktail in an empty restaurant in the middle of the week and have to wait 30 minutes for it? Neither had I -  'til I went here. My mom was in town and we wanted a quick lunch after a zoo trip with the kiddos and we happened to be on US-1 by this location. We were seated right away as the dining room was pretty empty.  The waitress took 15 minutes to come and greet us and take our drink order. We were pretty agitated by this, but she apologized and all was forgiven. 'Til she disappeared for a half hour. And didn't bring our drinks. Flustered, I approached the hostess and asked for the manager. After speaking with the manager, my drinks were delivered a few minutes later. Lo and behold, I get the wrong friggin' drink. Oh hell naw. So I send it back and wait another 10 minutes to get the correct one. We ordered our meals when we finally got our drinks. The food took like 45 minutes to come out and was cold. Shortly after our food arrived, I needed to orchestrate a trip to the ladies room with 3 little people. I walk in the restroom and immediately am hit with the pungent aroma of vomit. The chorus that accompanies such smells, you know, awful, heaving, death throe sounds, was also present. And of course, they were in the large handicap stall that I need to use. F#~@! So I had to wait. I was embarrassed to have to wait and face this poor person, but I'd have been even more embarrassed by 3 kids leaving a trail throughout the dining room. At last, the infirm one emerges from the stall - and guess whooooo? - MY FRIGGIN' WAITRESS. OH HEEEEEEEELL NO! She gave me a sheepish grin and a nod, wiped her mouth with her sleeve, and was off. No handwashin', no nothin'. I was horrified. I did what I needed to do and hurried out of the restroom. I ran straight for the hostess again and politely, with a twinge of urgency, requested to speak with the manager once more. Manager came over, apologized, gave us our check (which I was charged for the improper drink AND the proper drink on - but she fixed it), and gave me a coupon for a free appetizer.  A free app? Why in the world would I ever go back? I'm praying the waitress was just pregnant with some morning sickness or something and wasn't contagious. But seriously, if you're vomiting and work in food service most especially, stay home please. Gonna be a long time before I step foot in a Fridays again, if ever. :\",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables?start=80,2.84,2.84,2.84,1.8280000000000003,2.84

The waiter was absolutely a joke. He didn't even bring us water until 30 minutes into the meal. He also didn't give my friends the Happy Hour special that was going on unless we sat on the other side of the wall that separated the bar from the dining room. It did not specify that anywhere! Also, my friends got their beers when I got my water. I was so disappointed sitting there because I used to go to that Fridays so many times when I was in high school. It was such a joke. I have never had such horrible service in my life. I do not recommend this Fridays at all! Oh and not to mention when they brought the manager over, he did nothing to fix the situation. You could tell how much he didn't want to help out. He didn't comp anything or offer a free drink to my friends. We work in customer service and the customer always comes first. You should try your best to fix the situation. Go above and beyond. I don't care if it's the apocalypse. You go out of your way. It's sad to see that Fridays has lost its touch. I was so excited to get the Oereo Madness when I first arrived, but then I didn't want to give the waiter any  more of my time, so we decided to go to the TCBY next door..which was totally awesome!!

The salad my friend had was delicious. The lettuce didn't have that grunge taste that you find in other local restaurants. The toppings on her Cobb salad must have been organic - the flavors were too rich to be mass produced corporate farmed. Selena and I only had one things to say ""let us have more!"" I indulged in the divine French Onion Soup. The broth was perfectly seasoned and the onions succulent enough to where I asked ""is Julia Child in the kitchen whipping dis up?"" The provolone cheese, garnished with what I believe to be parsley, was golden brown protecting the bread underneath. Oh-my-god, the bread! The bread had to have been just sliced from a fresh french loaf. -- Now, I don't normally eat carbs, but for this I made an exception.  My main course was the Friday's Fried Shrimp. As a native to Florida, let me tell you: the only place to get good seafood in this state is the Coral Gables TGI Fridays. These must have been gumbo gulf shrimp delivered that morning (thank goodness the oil spill is a non issue, otherwise they'd have some god awful farm raised shrimp). The shrimp were perfectly fried golden brown - like pieces of the sun had fallen onto my plate. I can't even begin to describe the seasonings on them. Come to think of it, it may just have been salt, but who care? Salt them bad boys!  The side dishes where the (cream cheese) icing on this already too perfect of a cake. I got what could best be described as ""potato fritters."" They were slices of potatoes which were then fried and like the shrimp seasoned with some sort of heavenly spice (I could go either way with it being salt).  My other side was rice.  Selena and I skipped dessert. We moved over to the bar after dinner and had a few cocktails. I had the mint julep - Friday's unofficial specialty. Selena took several shots of 151.

95,Gino B.,"Coral Gables, FL",4,5,1.0,2.0,2014-06-19,"Arrived at the restaurant with three friends on a Wednesday around 9:30. There were plenty of open tables but we had to wait because there weren't enough servers to handle more tables. So we stood around with other parties waiting for about 10 minutes.  Once we were seated we waited another 10 minutes for our incompetent waiter to come and apologize two more times before we finally got place a simple drink order. Another 5 minutes passes by and were still waiting for our 4 glasses of water and to place our order.  Now we finally place our order and the food eventually comes out. 3 orders come out together and then we wait another 5 minutes before the last dish came out. Thankfully the orders were right and this is the only reason they got two stars. Portions are good but the price doesn't exactly match the quality.  Once we finish our meal it's time to wait again for the check and pay. And as you guessed it took another 20 minutes. All in all it took us an hour and a half to have what should have been a quick dinner.  Overall, the service is crappy and the food isn't exactly worth the new menu prices. If you want a similar meal with less hassle and better taste take an extra 5 min and go to Chilis",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables?start=60,2.04,2.04,2.04,1.8960000000000001,2.04

I ordered mozzarella sticks with a margarita which the server told me I was able to get them to put a favor in for like $0.50 more which I thought was perfect. Turns out they weren't doing that anymore. I told her I was fine with that I guess no drinks for me. When I got my food, I ordered the Jack Daniel's Sampler and I couldn't eat the chicken without a glass of water. It was too much! I didn't finish it and ate the ribs and shrimp instead. When the time came to dessert, I ordered the brownie obsession. I thought to myself, didn't treat myself to a drink why not get a dessert. So I did and it was the biggest mistake! The brownie didn't even taste like brownie! It tasted like dirt! The ice cream was already melted! My friend ordered the same thing and her brownie was burnt! She didn't even finish it! We both thought, we should've gone with the Oreo Madness. The service was okay. We only saw our server to take our orders. She didn't even deliver our food. She bought us the water and checks. Make sure you go over your check and don't get charge for something you didn't order or did not get! She was overcharging me and apologized and change my check. She welcomed us back which was a nice thing for her to do. Overall my experience tonight made me realized I will not be going back to this TGIF. I rather drive to the one in Dolphin Mall.

49,Abisai H.,"Miami, FL",670,166,692.0,1.0,2014-08-08,"This used to be one of our favorite places to go and just enjoy good food and drinks.  It's sad to say that after our visit today it has changed. To begin the service was not anywhere near what it used to be. The place has gone from friendly and helpful waiters to careless unprofessionals.  We sat and asked for drinks. The waiter recommended one of the new margaritas on the menu and my wife got a berry mojito shaker. When the drinks came, they had all the ingredients but the alcohol. The margaritas were pure sweet and sour mix with a bag of sugar added to them. The mojito tasted like water with a drop of raspberry juice. We sent the drinks back and when we received them again our waiter said that the recipe was done correctly. Apparently there is a new bartender in the house.  I ended up asking for another berry mojito with an extra shot. It came separate because the bartender refused to mix it.  Time for the food. Our waiter explained the new 10 dollar unlimited appetizer deal. When we decided to do it, he began to explain we couldn't order ten appetizers and that he was going to do an exception for us by letting us order up to four times. Seriously who orders more that 4 of the same appetizer at Fridays! I have to say we felt very uncomfortable with his recommendation and almost canceled the order.  The food arrived for everyone but myself. I had ordered the shrimp and chicken sizzler and it arrived after the rest of the table was finished. By this time I had lost my interest in my order and was even more disappointed when the plate was placed in front of me. Two very minuscule pieces of chicken breast and 4 small shrimp, over yellow cheese and a spoonful of mash potato.  What a disaster and horrific experience. What once used to be the place to enjoy in a Friday night has become anything but that.

Miami has become quite the foodie city, so the competition is huge! The Larger chained restaurants are competing with smaller businesses which offer better service and food.  Fridays totally stayed behind. To start off theybremodeled their location not so long ago and it's horrible! Extremely plain. I loved all the items they had hanging from the ceiling and on the walls! A very edgy and lively place to dine at. Not anymore :(  I know the crowd is young most of the time but that doesn't mean you can talk to your guests like they're family. There's got to be some sort of professionalism. Our waiter recommended us some drinks that when they came tasted more like sour mix than alcohol. I opted out and got a berry mojito, let's just say all I tasted were the berries. Extremely watered down berry juice.  Now, the only reason I gave them 2 stars is because I absolutely LOVE the fried green beans. They now have a deal that you pay $10 and get unlimited orders of it. It's a pretty good deal but I feel like they have to constantly do stuff like that to lure guests in.  But apparently unlimited was limited! He explained that we couldn't get 9 or 10 of them. I mean who gets 9 of the same appetizer, but if it's unlimited what IF I do want 10?   I usually get the Fridays shrimp for dinner, with regular fries. A dozen Fried shrimp. My husband got a sizzler which consisted of tiny chicken breasts and a few shrimp. Honestly, with what I paid here, we could've gone to any smaller restaurant and gotten better and bigger amounts of food. I'm sondisappointed with Fridays!

54,Lauren M.,"Denver, CO",120,401,592.0,3.0,2014-09-02,"I'm writing another review for a chain restaurant, and as usual, I'll rate it a 3. Nothing really stood out to me, but nothing was oh my god awful.  I definitely like having the TGIF Stripes rewards (very easy to sign up for this) because you get free chips and salsa as a starter. And studies have shown that it's in human nature to enjoy free appetizers. I think it might even be stated in the Bible, but in one of those lost books no one really knows about. Unfortunately, the drinks at this location were extremely weak, but I think this is true of most Friday's locations. The Blackberry Long Island Tea Shaker didn't even make my cheeks rosy, but it was still tasty and refreshing. I thought those drinks were supposed to be notoriously strong. And the strawberry daiquiri my family friend ordered was bubblegum pink, not the true reddish pink of a legit daiquiri - and it apparently tasted more like ice than strawberry. When we asked the server if they accidentally put in a virgin daiquiri order, she was very accommodating and said she'd ask the bartender to add more mix. When she came back, they definitely bumped up the alcohol level. So if you go to this location and your adult beverage tastes like it has zero alcohol, don't suffer in silence. They were very nice about fixing it. As for the food, it was fine. Burgers are always a safe bet. And the server let us try a side of the Jack Daniels sauce - I wasn't crazy about it, but I ordered the black bean burger. Not the best combination. All in all, TGI Friday's offers good discounts, good burgers, and the friendly staff clearly wants you to enjoy your experience there and come back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables?start=20,2.2,2.2,2.2,2.1239999999999997,2.2

68,Steve T.,"Hollywood, FL",8,144,7.0,1.0,2014-10-25,"The first time I went to a Fridays restaurant was in the '70s and back then it was truly a dining destination.  I used to order the Shrimp Friday which was large fried shrimp that rivaled any local seafood restaurant served with an amazing cherry dipping sauce.  Remember that huge onion ring that used to come on the plate with most entrees?  Great frozen drinks.  Those were the days.  Sadly Fridays has declined to the point where the food is not only unpalatable, it is void of any flavor, creativity, or substance.  I have noticed this repeatedly over the last several outings to Fridays restaurants but my most recent visit to their Coral Gables location was the most disappointing yet.  I ordered the Jack Daniels Sampler which was described on the menu as Jack Daniels chicken tenders, shrimp, and ribs.  What arrived at my table were dry baby back ribs (no sauce), a few small fried shrimp that were popcorn sized, and some chicken nuggets (some were too small to even be called nuggets).  Also on the plate was a ramekin of Jack Daniels sauce that was so small it only had about a tablespoon of sauce in it for all the items on my plate.  The chicken nuggets that were described on the menu as tenders were inedible.  My dog did enjoy them though.  McDonalds has better chicken nuggets.  The shrimp were nothing o write home about but they were better than the ribs.  The shrimp I am sure were frozen but I could not tell because they were so little.  The ribs were just plain crappy.  I tried to put a little of that vapid sauce on them but there was hardly enough to give anything any flavor.  What the heck happened Fridays?  How do you go to being an excellent dining venue to serving food that is not fit for consumption?  I don't get it.  Needless to say the bar and restaurant were empty which speaks volumes.  If I ever find myself in a situation where I must return I will probably order a salad or some other item that does not involve actual cooking.  I am in no hurry to ever return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables?start=80,2.2,2.2,2.2,1.988,2.2

But unfortunately things are changing at TGIF, I clearly feel that the quality of the food and the service is going downhill. Last night we ordered ribs and the grilled chicken and shrimp. When the food came we all giggled.. the picture of the chicken and shrimp plate on the menu shows very different sizes (of both the chicken and the shrimp), but anyway, what else is new in this business? But the taste was good, everything was hot, in my opinion a 4* for a chain restaurant. What blew 1* off my rating is service. Although our waiter was nice and friendly, he was missing in action most of the time. Our drinks took forever (drinks = two glasses of draft beer, complicated?), arriving almost at the same time as the food, which by the way took very long too. Ordering the bill was another challenge in time travel, and then waiting for him to get my credit card to close it definitively signified a singularity in the time continuum black hole phenomena. One thing that really bothers me is the WATS (""waiters avoiding table service""), since the only job of a waiter is to ... wait tables! If he is always missing in action then he needs to change careers. Sorry. I'm paying... and tipping... I expect and deserve service, and I WILL knock off stars (and add stars too) for the quality of service I get.

31,April W.,"Miami, FL",64,151,351.0,4.0,2016-08-17,"So, hubs was off while I slaved away at work and he decided to pick me up for lunch in my area. How sweet :) The choices are rather limited in the near area and we ended up here.  Seating was readily available and it was not too crowded. The server seemed very attentive and checked in on us a few times before we were ready to decide, without being pushy or making us feel rushed.  The lunch specials are a decent value, and come with the choice of soup, house salad, Caesar salad, or mozzarella sticks as a side, and a small portion of fries. I ordered the spicy chicken sliders w/ fries, and chose the house salad as my side. Hubs ordered the spicy Cajun chicken pasta w/ fries, and mozzarella sticks as his side (the fries come automatically, in case you're thinking fries are a strange accompaniment with pasta). We ordered chicken fingers with mandarin oranges from the kids menu for my daughter.  Wait time for the food was rather slow (about 20 minutes) and I think this was the fault of the kitchen rather than the server. It was not that busy, so they must be cutting back on the cooking staff. Being on my lunch break, I was particularly aware of the wait time. Finally I decided to ask the waitress how much longer, and soon after the food arrived. Unfortunately, the kitchen had messed up my order and gave me mozzarella sticks instead of my salad (I know it was the kitchen's error because the order was correct on the bill). At that point I was in a hurry, and could not afford the time to ask for the correct side.  I enjoyed my food, as did my daughter. My sliders were decent, fries were well-seasoned, and the mozzarella sticks were good. My daughter liked her food too, and the portion was big (3 big tenders and a decent size dish of oranges). Hubby was the only one unpleased. He felt the pasta tasted charred, but was ok with the fries and mozzarella sticks. We ordered a brownie with ice cream for dessert and that was veryyyyyy good. Yummy, soft, and perfectly warmed.  Overall, I had a good experience and the menu had several yummy sounding items that I would be curious to try in the future.

Those two go to: The waitress (not service), we happened to have a nice waitress who seemed like she may enjoy her job, and then the food which is always decent.  The atmosphere here is AWFUL. They sat us in the farthest booth, next to the bathrooms/ kitchen (gross) and no TVs were visible. The music was extremely weak and barely audible, and the yelling and dish noises overpowered it coming from the kitchen. We order drinks, then appetizers, and the appetizer comes out first. We give it a good 5-10 minutes and no drinks. I get up and go to the bar where I see our drinks sitting, and I have to ask a food runner to bring them over to us. NOT GOOD when a customer needs to ask where their are drinks at the bar. Trust me I'm a laid back person too. More yelling in Spanish coming from the kitchen throughout dinner. I ask my BF what they are saying (I don't speak Spanish ) and he says you don't want to know. Some guy with long, purple and pink hair that's shaved on the sides hanging out in the kitchen (view from my booth I can see everyone working back there) Where is the hair net?!!!!

Since that time my family and I have decided to give them the opportunity to show that improvements have been made. I am happy to report that my neighborhood Friday's restaurant has made immense improvement in both the food and service. I have now visited this store three times since my last review and I can say that the changes are like night and day. I would now recommend this store to anyone who would like a well cooked meal served with a smile.

35,Miami R.,"Miami, FL",116,77,32.0,1.0,2017-01-01,"So, where do I begin?  I had to debate which stars to give, because I've some good experiences here in the past. That said, I've had a bunch of less than good experiences. This last visit though has prompted me to give it the lower stars.  The restaurant is slipping and thus I can't forgive the bad because of the good they used to have.  My wife and I went in on Thursday (12/29/16)  We were greeted right away, and sat quickly. Not sure why Fridays makes the hostess tell the guest that they are their hostess, by name. But, neither here nor there.  Our server made her way pretty quickly, she was one of those servers that sits with guests as they take the order. I'm all for that, IF, you are a top server who has their job locked in. (She was not one of those)  Name on the receipt says michal but it sounded like she said knee-shawl (spelling phonetically) I ordered my Diet Coke, my wife ordered kettle with soda and a splash of cran, plus a glass of water. She came back a few minutes later with my soda, but no water for my wife while she waited for the bartender to get her drink ready. The receipt shows she rang in the drinks correctly, but the first drink came out just vodka and a splash of cran. That was when the drink finally came.  She came back to take our order. We went with an a sampler appetizer of pot stickers, pretzels and boneless wings. I ordered the ribs & ribeye combo, my wife ordered the black bean burger.  So, time goes by, and goes by, and goes by. Next thing we know, the entrees are here, but the app never showed up. I mentioned it, and the hostess went back to check on it. I pointed out to the server that the steak that was in the plate was a New York, not a ribeye. The hostess came back with appetizers I handed her my entree and said this will have to go back. She responded with, ""why?"" I said trust me, just take this to the kitchen please. She left the burger behind though.  We started eating the appetizer, wings were great, pretzel was good, pot stickers were cold. So, back the food went again to make everything hot.  Mind you, there weren't any sharing plates to eat the appetizer off of and no extra napkins.  I got the manager involved, Javier. I explained what was happening so far. He was understandably disappointed. He took away the app, and finally the black bean burger.  My wife at this point had been waiting for a refill on her drink, so Javier ordered one for her. This one came out correctly.  The hostess, who should have just quit while she was behind, after the why comment, came over and said you should make sure the manager discounts your bill. I said thanks, everything is being worked on. She patted my wife on the back and said, you have your hands filled with this one.  Javier brings back the sampler, and everything was hot and delicious.  While eating the sampler, someone came by to drop off my entree again, but we had just gotten the app, so he kept walking. I noticed though that he didn't have the burger, which I found out why a little later.  We finished the sampler and the server said you finished your burger right? My wife said no, they took that back too so we could eat our appetizer.  We were told my food was ready, they were just waiting for my wife's burger now.  Our entrees finally come out, ribs were good, ribeye was a little over cooked, but still good. Mashed potatoes were blah, coleslaw was fine. My wife enjoyed her black bean burger.  Javier came out to check on us and ordered my wife another drink, because her glass had been empty for a while again.  Towards the end Javier came back out to again offer his apology for the evening. He gave me 3 $10 gift cards. And then our server came back. She asked if we wanted any dessert, by this point it was almost 11:00 and we were really just done, so we said no. She brought the bill, I opened it curiously like I wonder what had been done to the bill. Last shock if the night.... nothing had been done to the bill. Not a comped app, not a drink, nothing. (Yes, I'm aware he gave me gift cards, but that's so it insures I come back another time to spend money) and it also helps not have to explain the next day why things he to be comped.  He seems to have tried to recover the bad experience, but the effort fell a little short. But he did try.  After just now reading the back of the cards, they can't be combined. So in order to use them, I'd have to come back three separate times. That's just made the situation worse. Fail!! There needs to be a lot of retraining in that location. There was an entire section that was just filled with dirty tables that were dirty when we sat and still dirty when we left.  I guess that wraps up my most recent experience.  Food is tasty, service ruins the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables,2.76,2.55,2.55,1.8280000000000003,2.6339999999999995
24,Serena P.,"Weston, FL",150,122,246.0,4.0,2017-01-22,"Ok so I know what you are thinking....four stars for this chain restaurant. Let me start by saying I have been going to Friday's for many many years, so part of me loves the nostalgic feeling I get dining here. However, to be fair, the four stars I am giving were earned on my last visit.  I went with a group of girls from work during our lunch break so we were kind of in a rush. I didn't get a chance to order an appetizer and went straight to my entree. I am absolutely in love with the Jack Daniels chicken strips (on the starters menu). Very good portion size, especially for lunch. The tenders are crispy and tossed in a semi-sweet Jack Daniels glaze. Order with a side of fries to dip in the extra glaze and you have got a perfect meal!  Bummed I didn't have time to order dessert we asked the waiter for our checks. Considering the restaurant was dead he took a while to being them out, but I will let it go since we did ask to have the check split 5 ways.  Overall, service was good, as was food.

40,Josephine P.,"Miami, FL",0,5,,1.0,2017-10-02,"Horrible experience at this TGI fridays. We got there at 11:50pm knowing that they close at 2am. We were 6 people trying to seat down and eat. The server seemed like she didn't want to work. She was making all kinds of excuses to not seat us.First, she said that the ""only big tables"" were taken by people. We suggested that they can put two tables together. She said she couldn't do that because it could be a hazard to everyone. Then she said she couldn't really seat us because the kitchen is closing. What kind of business are they running here? When you close the kitchen 2 hours before they say they close. First time and last time we come here. They don't want to work and the owners are seriously losing money. When it's a big party they usually try to arrange everyone. Owners should definitely reconsider their employees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables?start=20,2.16,2.37,2.37,,2.2860000000000005
27,Christopher R.,"Miami, FL",21,7,,1.0,2017-10-08,"This is a usual to go spot for me and my family after church. We are usually a party of 5 or more and always have issues at this location. Today was extra special. We walked into an EMPTY restaurant and were asked to wait 10 mins because the didn't have a server available for us (?). We were finally sat at an uncomfortable table (a round table butt up against a square table) after complaining because they had sat other ""smaller"" parties before us. I thought they didn't have a server? I will update after the meal, hopefully that redeems the afternoon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables,2.16,2.36,2.36,,2.2800000000000002
50,Jordyn M.,"Coral Gables, FL",109,1,,1.0,2017-10-24,"So I order my meal and I asked for my meal with no cheese. I was waiting for takeout for a while and by the time i received the food, it was still kinda cold. I walked all the way home to look and see that the mashed potatoes was not in the bag. I had to go all the way back, and as I walk in the employee turned around and handed me the bag of it claiming the man forgot to pack it. At this point, I am quite upset. Then I get home AGAIN to see the mashed potatoes had cheese in it. Ok so at this point I'm sure they don't know what the fuck they're doing. I'm not even considering walking back now, so I call them. I get on the phone with the manager and all she can do is tell me ""well it comes with cheese there's nothing we can do about that"". Now, why the fuck the employee didn't mention that before i don't know!!! The manager than proceeded to tell me I can return to receive another option. This tomfoolery of an establishment has sealed it's fate and those 2 1/2 stars on yelp ain't going up anytime soon.

20,Cathy O.,"Miami, FL",67,199,182.0,4.0,2017-12-17,"Check into the specials if you live nearby. My husband has some type of loyalty card and gets many free offers, plus he goes there after UM basketball games and racks up all kinds of points. Last night my dinner was free: Jack Daniels ribs, mashed potatoes, and lemon broccoli. Yummy. Friday's has a pretty decent selection of American type fare, and their quality is consistent. We were trying to catch a movie, and they were fairly fast. There is definitely always plenty of parking. Tonight I had merlot, but they have fireball specials that are great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables,2.12,2.38,2.38,,2.276
