2,Chris G.,"London, United Kingdom",132,393,68.0,4.0,2015-01-12,"Chains. I always talk about them. Love them or hate them, they are here and here to stay. They are both good things and bad things. If you walk into a good chain anywhere around the world and they serve you food that you had thought of before setting foot on the premises at a reasonable price with service that makes you smile - what's wrong with a chain? On the other hand, I hate to see chain stores and restaurants, replacing one of a kind unique places. So where does TGI Fridays fall on the spectrum? Will with this branch in particular, I had an absolutely wonderful night here! The cocktails were big and the cheap here, just like I like my...... oh never mind. Even though we were a rather rambunctious group, the staff took us with good humour and even got excitable with us at some points. They took some mild teasing and battered it straight back at us, creating a welcoming good vibe, which can be sometimes hard to do with a larger table of people. The food I had here was not exactly cordon bleu. Nor was it innovative. But did I enjoy it and find it good value for money? Most definitely. I did. And that's really what matters doesn't it? If you had a great night in a place and felt that it was reasonable value for money - what is not to like about that?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coventry,,,,,

0,Sophie M.,"Coventry, United Kingdom",14,34,128.0,5.0,2016-03-08,"Great atmosphere and friendly, informative staff! Am never disappointed. Last night's birthday meal was great. There were 10 of us altogether and the staff (we had the ginger floppy haired guy with the glasses - he was fab) were totally attentive and always wanted to make sure we got the best out of our money.  We had a voucher code which entitled us to so many free cocktails as it was someone's birthday. The rules of which I forget. Because. Free cocktails.  We also had a 2 for 1 cocktail offer on selected drinks. So everything got a bit confusing but our waiter didn't seem to mind explaining things 88 times over. Poor guy had the patience of a saint.  For dinner, I had the BBQ joe hot dog and it was DELISH",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coventry,,,,,

Nachos cheese melted but stone cold Burger which showed promise,looked great, was all dry. Could be better. The ribs were good though-recommend  Pud (Apple crunch waffle ) very nice.(free due to burger issue)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coventry,,,,,
