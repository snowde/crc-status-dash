They have upped their game quite a bit, just like Ruby Tuesdays. The food was pretty darned good. I had a chicken dish and the wife had fish. We were both very satisfied and left feeling good.

I had no idea and never saw it previously.  Since the first visit to this location, I've also had no issues with using stripes rewards for my orders that I get to go.  My one new complaint is very, very minor. When I get chicken fingers or anything with a sauce, I'm given what might be the most shallow container of sauce known to man. I'm talking about maybe a quarter of an inch deep. Come on, guys. If it is a cost-cutting measure, I will gladly pay an extra 50 cents for about 3 times the BBQ sauce.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-creve-coeur?start=60,2.356,2.356,2.356,2.356,2.356

68,MARSHA W.,"Saint Louis, MO",55,87,4.0,4.0,2013-04-29,So this Fridays has gone thru a lot of cycles.  Its been very good and very bad.   I still like it but I do wish they would stop taking the things off the menu I like.   Of course that is more the corperate office than the location.   I have to say though lately the food has been better than it has been in quite awhile.   The timing seems to be improving too for the first time in a long time soups and salads and appetizers come out before the main course.  I personally think that Fridays overdoes it with the Jack Daniels entrees but I guess they have a contract with them and a lot of people like sweet stuff on their food but I am not one of them.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-creve-coeur?start=60,2.064,2.064,2.064,2.064,2.064

Once we got seated it took a bit to get waited on.  Then another wait.  Maybe another 20 minutes or longer to get food.  Now, I can understand when the restaurant was slammed there would be a delay but this place was barely 50% capacity. When the food came out it came out in pieces, meaning we each got served separately.  So my wife ate and almost finished hers when my daughters food came out, then she was nearly complete, then mine came out.  The food was OK.  Nothing to brag about or HAVE to go back for.

42,Kelly S.,"Bothell, WA",239,88,10.0,1.0,2014-08-13,"I think we can all agree that Friday's across the country have seen better days. This used to be IMHO the best nationwide causal full service chain, superior to Chili's and miles above Applebee's. But what isn't?  But this review is specifically for this train wreck of a location. So yeah... Five of us walk in the restaurant about 45 min to close for a quick bite after a long day. We were led to a dark corner, cued non verbally by the hostess to step over a dirty, wet mop on the way. That mop remained laying on its side on the floor for the full 90 minutes that we ate our ""food"". But I'm getting ahead of myself. So we sit... Ten minutes go by with no server. The server shows and can't answer the basic questions and proceeds to forget half the drink orders upon the second visit another ten minutes later. We wonder where she is as we're tucked away in a dark corner. On around the third trip we remind her that we'd actually like to eat and haven't placed an order. She smells more and more like cigarette smoke on each visit. Some bottomless appetizers finally arrive at some point. Orders are placed with great frustration as the server is too high or drunk to comprehend (not kidding). Now the food. Oh the food. We order these new sample plates they're promoting. The second round of the bottomless apps arrives and looks entirely different than the first. I mean, two separate appetizer dishes both looked so completely different than their predecessors that we wondered how it was even possible.  I don't want to go too far into detail about the food but let's just leave it at ""a few things were halfway edible"". I could be here all day explaining the awfulness of the cold, dry, tasteless food we received across the board.  Most of us Yelpers have had this kind of bad night at a restaurant before, when absolutely nothing goes right. So were we one bit surprised that our under-the-influence server overcharged several items on the bill and took another 10-15 min to resolve? Not even a little bit.  I would give most restaurants the benefit of the doubt between a terrible server and an off night in the kitchen, but there was even a manager on duty who was about as useful as the wet mop on the floor. He did not talk to us and I think helped carry two plates of food at one point. There were no other customers occupying his time either.   All in all: this Friday's must require not giving a damn as a prerequisite for hire.

However, it's always hard for me to finish the meals. I always leave feeling completely disgusted. The food tastes fine, but I leave feeling gross, probably because of the amount of fried foods they serve. The wait staff is nice but slow. On our last visit, we literally sat there for 30 minutes before ever having a waiter come get our drink orders. When our waiter did arrive, he was nice, but never apologized for the wait. And a few of our orders got screwed up.  Overall, TGI Friday's is decent, but I always seem to leave feeling slightly sick. My dad even got food poisoning once from their salad.

18,Jess P.,"Saint Louis, MO",271,105,654.0,1.0,2016-03-13,"Sunday March 13, 2016  (10pm) So let me tell you guys about my horrible experience, I had at TGI Fridays, on this Sunday night. I just wanna say, I have never felt so unwanted as a customer, in my life, than i have felt tonight by the staff of the TGI Fridays at this location. So I've been craving the Sizzling Chicken an Cheese plate, been thinking about it all day, just knew i was going there, and having this for dinner. So we arrived at 10pm, it says their open till midnight. The hostess at the door, tells us that the dining area is closed, and we can sit at the bar. she wasn't very friendly or informative, nor did she guide us, or give us menus. So we sit at the bar for about 5 minutes and steal a menu from the other end of the bar.  The bartender, Chelsea,  approaches us, and she informs us that the kitchen had just closed, and we won't be able to place a food order. We were bummed and stated that we weren't here for the drinks, we specifically came here to eat, so we start to grab our keys and leave. She stops us, and says ""Well wait, let me check with the kitchen, maybe we can still squeeze your order in"" So she comes back, and gives us the green light. we place our order, she puts it in. After about five minutes after that. I see her again, and ask for a soda, and his drink. So we sit there for about 30 minutes, then she goes and checks on it, and comes back with a bag of To-Go food. Like my jaw dropped. just utter dissapointment, She states well i didn't know you wanted it for here. I clearly stated i was her to eat.  Like are you serious? did I ask for a to go order? How could you assume something like that? That could've easily been cleared up with a question, if you had any thought on it. Like I ordered a Sizzling dish, the point is to have it brought to me sizzling on a cast iron plate. The meal looked so un appealing in the to-go container, there was pretty much no cheese in the dish, and what they did have in there was burnt to a cheese crisp that was at the bottom of the container. The mashed potatoes was just blah, absolutely no flavor, and tasted like they were instant mashed potatoes.   Not only did the food lack, i ate my dish at the bar with plastic utensils, out of the plastic containers. The bartender had no interest in taking the food back and properly plating it and serving it to us, once she found out that she had  made a mistake. She simply drops off 2 small side plates and some silverware. Like we're supposed to  take the food out of the containers and re-plate it, if we wish to eat here. My boyfriend was entirely pissed off, he didn't even try to eat his food, he simply took the togo container and stuck it in the togo bag, and waited on me to finish my meal. Honestly whats the point of saying your open till midnight, if your going to start closing 2 hours before that, and be busy doing closing jobs, that distract you from providing full service to the remaining guest that are trying to enjoy the establishment. So that was how i spent my Sunday night, getting treated like shit at TGI Fridays. All i wanted was some good service and some good food. Its clear that neither of those can be found at this location of TGI Fridays. Im sad to say this experience was so bad that i don't think i will ever return to any Fridays location, ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-creve-coeur,1.84,1.84,1.84,1.5080000000000002,1.8400000000000003
33,Cindy A.,"Wildwood, Saint Louis, MO",6,15,20.0,1.0,2016-03-13,"I thought I would calm down before I wrote this review because it breaks my heart.  I worked at Friday's in the 1980s.  It was a hard and rewarding job and I learned a lot about multi tasking, pace, team work, etc.  Now I am retired and don't get to eat what I want or go out to eat everyday.  I was really looking forward to a real hamburger and fries!  Maybe even dessert when we decided to go to Fridays.  It was so disappointing. The place was not clean.  The floor was slippery under my shoes and felt greasy.  Little bits of trash littered the station where we sat.  One family actually asked to sit elsewhere.  We ordered jack Daniels burgers.  They were dry and tasteless.  We weren't sure if they forgot the sauce or not.  There was a bullet on the side so we dipped or food in it.  I don't get to eat a lot of hamburgers.  When I do, it has to be a good one.  This was not.  It is not a cheap burger.  If you charge a premium price the product should be premium too.    Now for the service, this was ridiculous.  The poor hostess ran her ass off while the wait staff stood around the bus stations, leaning on them and hanging out.  I never saw my waiter after he dropped off the food.  Later we had to flag down another waitress and ask for napkins.  She brought us cocktail napkins and said ""here ya go!""  Finally we see our waiter who dropped the check off.  He never asked us if our food was ok or if we wanted to have dessert. We were looking forward to dessert since we walked in.  This waiter never once smiled or made sure our experience was good.  So today I can tell you I ate an expensive lunch at a dirty restaurant where people obviously didn't want to do their job of ensuring the guest had a good experience.     Now, I ask to speak to the manager.  I told him everything.  He apologized for everything with a speech that I am positive he has used several times.  He was a terrible example of a leader.  I told him how we had looked forward to dessert.  He never asked if we still wanted any!!!  So no dessert for us.      Friday's used to be fun, high energy with good food and great service.  It is gone.  Left is a dirty remnant of what it used to be.  After over 30 years of going to this restaurant, I can honestly say we will never go back.  I don't recommend you go there either.  This was not a one off, it is top down terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-creve-coeur?start=20,1.76,1.76,1.76,1.5080000000000002,1.7600000000000002

Lunch on a Wednesday just before noon, not yet busy.  We ordered four lunch deals and none of them scored even acceptable.  Both orders of ""Jack Sliders"" we're over overcooked and dry, on dry stale buns, with a hint of onion and nothing we could identify as JD glaze or whatever they were supposed to have.  Fries could scarcely deserved their name as the were undercooked, limp and cold.  Chicken sliders were clumsily assembled, boring and dry.  Mac & cheese with some kind of sausage was small and pretty much tasteless.  I didn't hear anyone complain about the fried mozzarella, but it would be hard to mess that up. I don't think they allow 4-strikes even in little league guys.  Pretty sad for someplace that's been around for decades.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-creve-coeur?start=20,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002

We had a party of 5 and they sat us as far back in the restaurant as possible. 2 of us arrived first and told the hostess we were expecting 3 other women. Ten minutes later we found two of the other women sitting at another table. Good job hostess! The server has a problem getting our drinks out because that took about 15 minutes. 5 waters, 1 club soda, and 1 vodka. We order. One person at the table asked if the spinach side dish has dairy because she doesn't eat it. The waitress has no clue. 3 out of 5 meals come out and she delivers them and looks at our dairy free friend and tells her the spinach has cheese would she like something else? I apologized but said I was going to start eating because if she's delivering our food but taking her side dish order it's going to be a while and mine would be cold. I ordered a small portion of chicken strips and fries. It was all cold anyway and undercooked. Another 10 minutes elapse and the remaining 2 members receive their meals after 3 of us had been eating. We ask for mustard (she says they don't have brown mustard only yellow), bbq sauce, and napkins. That's another 8-10 minutes. She brings the check and 1 to go box. The bill was roughly $48. I handed her a $100 bill. During the eternity we waited for change a man who was presumably some sort of manager stopped at the table and asked how we were all doing. I mentioned that we were great but we had been waiting for change for quite a while. He said yeah, someone handed us a $100 bill and we've been breaking it.

I only gave 3 stars because of the little girl that was SUPPOSED to seat us.  We always come to this location and the waitresses are ALWAYS NICE!!!  MANAGER NICE!!!  Even the ones that just walk by our table are nice. Anywho this particular evening we decided to come here and have dinner and after being told the wait would be 10 minutes we sat down and waited. 5 minutes later these three guys come in and one of them ask us how long the wait for us would be, we tell him 5~10 minutes and this punk b*tch turns his nose up at us after answering his oodles of noodles looking ass and continues to talk to Phineas and Ferb (the other 2 funny looking f*ckers he was with). I'm guessing because we were two lesbians he felt his manhood was going to shrink.  Anyway, the one guy starts talking to the young girl that's taking people's names for seating. I overheard him asking her where he knew her from and she started saying who she was related to. Before we know it, this Lil bubble head ass girl picks up 3 menus and goes and seats these three apple head mfkrs before us.  So we're like W.T.F..LIKE HOLD UP.. WHERE THEY DO THAT SH*T AT?!?!? I'm guessing HERE!! As she comes back she can't even look us in the eyes because she knowssss she was dead wrong. So we're about to blow an immediate fuse until the manager asks what happened and we told him. He seated us quickly and apologized about the situation and he even offered to take  20% off of the bill.  So we're like alright.. Cool. In the mist of all of this he asked the the girl why she seated them before us and her response was that we were waiting on a booth, funny thing is we didn't even have that conversation about where we wanted to sit. Anyway, I'm continuing to eat my favorite sizzling chicken and cheese dinner, low and mfkn behold there is a GOSHDAMN LONG BLACK ASS HAIR IN MY FOOD!!!!! I know sh*t happens,  but DAYUMMMMMMMMM really!!! So we call for the manager AGAIN and he comes over and he's like damn and shakes his head and tells us he'll handle the the full bill.  We appreciate it, but that hair made me feel some type of way because I was halfway through my dinner.  Has me thinking did I swallow anything that wasn't apart of my meal. Anyway waitresses great, manger great!! The lil f*cktard chick at the door has alot to learn,  whoever in the back cooking with loose hairs floating around please control your hair cousin it,  sheesh. As we're leaving out,  the little pumpkin head *ss girl who started this bad experience made sure she didn't even look our way.  As everybody knows when you are leaving the restaurant, who's ever at the door always says have a good evening or something like that. She didn't even acknowledge us, back in the day I would've cursed her lil dumb*ss out and made a scene, but now I just let my fingers do the talking for me on yelp. Anyway, I guess this wasn't a good experience for myself or T. G. I,  smh. I just want to say,  I'm not holding any of this against the waitresses or the manager because some things are just out of their control. Will we come back to this location?

28,Bob G.,"St Louis, MO",11,45,,2.0,2017-08-25,"If the service had been better, the rating would have been at least 3 or 4 stars.  My wife and I had the new ribs, they were very good and they were indeed tender.  The waitress was curt and abrupt at best.  She does not have the finesse to be a good waitress.  When you see a glass almost empty, you should get the person a refill.  I had to wave down a supervisor who immediately brought me a new glass, he left the empty glass.  The waitress came by and saw the empty and was going to get me a refill when she noticed that I already had one.  The comment was: ""Oh, you already got a refill"".  I had a coupon which she took at the beginning of the meal, commented when we were ready for the bill that she will see that the coupon is applied.  Except, she brought the bill without the credit.  I showed it to her and her comment was, ""he was supposed to take the amount off"".  Brought the corrected bill with no comment: no sorry, no thank you, nothing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-creve-coeur?start=20,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
1,Matt S.,"Saint Louis, MO",2,4,,1.0,2017-10-20,"This is our second time going to this location in the last 3 months and both times have been simply horrible and included with all of the usual cliches. Multiple wait staff walking past us working with other tables, same waitstaff hanging out, worst of all was the wait.  3 months ago we gave them the benefit of the doubt and ended up waiting for almost 20 minutes before we were actually approached/had orders taken. This time around we gave them 10 minutes as yet again staff walked past us constantly with/without food and casually chilling out at the closest waiter's station(20 feet away) tl;dr save yourself the headache and go to the Applebee's on the other side of 270",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-creve-coeur,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88

0,Judy J.,"Saint Charles, MO",7,25,63.0,3.0,2017-11-17,"This was my first time at this location. Stopped with a friend to have appetizers and drinks. We had potato skins and the spinach queso dip. Everything tasted good but was just typical bar food. We tried a couple of the specialty drinks, Barbados rum punch and Long Island tea, pricey but good.  Since we sat in the bar area, the bartender was our server. It was a little slow but we weren't in a hurry so it didn't bother us. If you're on a time schedule, probably not the best place to sit.  All things considered, it was ok, but wouldn't rush back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-creve-coeur,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002
8,Sandy K.,"Chesterfield, MO",3,3,,1.0,2017-12-04,"I haven't been to a TGI Fridays in years. My 7 y.o. daughter wanted to go to someplace new (to her) and so we went there for a girls dinner after church. It was so disappointing! I ordered a grilled chicken Cesar salad  because I remembered that they were so good there. It was the most generic salad with a very small amount of something that was supposed to be chicken on top. I don't know what happened to the chicken. It was spongy and nasty. The portion was very small too. I was still hungry after eating it. My daughter had the mac and cheese. She said it was good but again it was a very small amount -- even for a kid's size. Since we were still hungry, we took the recommendation of the server and enrolled in the rewards program so we could get a free dessert. We ordered one of their holiday shakes. It looks great in the picture but it was NOT good. I can't see how you can mess up ice cream but it didn't taste like anything had had big chunks of ice in it. It is also impossible to eat without getting covered in goo. I will say the server was very nice and our food came quickly but I won't be coming back anytime soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-creve-coeur,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002

I could hardly believe it. Tgi is big franchise restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-creve-coeur,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002
