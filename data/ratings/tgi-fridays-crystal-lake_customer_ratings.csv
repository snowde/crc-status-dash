8,John M.,"McHenry, IL",13,10,,2.0,2012-01-16,"This was the 3rd time we have visited this place and it might be the last. The food was OK. We did like the different combo meals (3 for 12.99, 2 for 10.00). The drink my wife had was very good.     We arrived at 5:30pm with 4 people and they were no busy by any means, maybe 10-12 tables w/ people. It took about 5-10min for the server to greet us. It took another 5-10min to receive drinks and then they got mixed up. We were undecided about what to have so she said that she would be back in a couple minutes. Meanwhile she took another tables order and disappeared for 10-15 minutes. She came back took our order and disappeared again. I was thinking she would be back in a couple minutes with our salads but that took about 15min. Meanwhile the other table was served their dinner. About halfway thru our salads, the entrees arrived. As we ate dinner she brought refills and mixed them up again. Just before we were done eating the other table got up and left. We finished and she cleared the empties, then told my wife she would bring her dessert. That took another 10min to get a piece of cheesecake. It took a little while to get our check, pay and leave. So we ended up leaving at about 7:10pm. It took 1hr 40min for a dinner for 4 people that should not have taken more than an hour.    I am not sure if we will make it back, but the food was decent and the drink was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crystal-lake,,,,,
1,Erin D.,"Chicago, IL",87,373,7.0,2.0,2012-02-13,"Ohhhhhh nothing has changed here.  It's been awhile since I've been to Fridays and now I know why.  Its the same meh menu and way over priced if you don't get one of their 2-1 meals.   Service was ok.  Our server was a little snippy.  I get it they just opened but hey, I'm a paying customer. We ordered nachos, which came on half slabs of taco shells.  Nothing really to write home about.  Nothing looked fresh for just being open.     I had the kung pao chicken and it was shockingly not bad.   I guess this kinda Friday's isn't my thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crystal-lake,,,,,
10,Diane T.,"Crystal Lake, IL",0,2,,4.0,2012-03-11,"Husband and I have been here 3 times and had consistently good food and service! Most recently had the the Mediterranean chicken kabob with cucumber tadzhiki sauce - delicious.  Came with rice with red peppers and parsley as well as moist PETA bread slices.  Husband ordered the Dragonfire salmon and enjoyed it a lot.  Great ultimate margherita, (although the $8 price is high), but my husband ordered the very reasonably priced $4/glass Barefoot Cabernet which evened out the cost.  We will definitely be back for another enjoyable meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crystal-lake,,,,,
2,Jeff V.,"Cary, IL",1,18,1.0,1.0,2012-05-27,"Waited for food for over an hour. Manager told us food would be ""right up"" twice. It never showed up. WE decided that we had waited long enough and went next door and ate at Portillos. We would usually go to Fridays a few times a month. Not anymore!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crystal-lake,,,,,
3,Taylor M.,"Wauconda, IL",13,97,,2.0,2013-01-06,Typical chain.  Bad tasting food that is also Bad for you.  Everything is over priced.  The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is because the service isn't too bad.  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere local like Dukes or The Cottage where the cooks actually care about what their cooking and all the food doesn't come from a freezer bag.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crystal-lake,,,,,
6,peter b.,"Crystal Lake, IL",25,5,,1.0,2013-05-11,Worst service we sit down and wait for the waitress we put in our drink order then we place our dinner order I order the pick two and Colleen orders an appetizer and chicken fingers and Ellie gets a burger well it takes forever for Colleen and me to get our appetizers when hers is just pretzel sticks and cheese and mine is a flat bread pizza well when we get the apps we don't get any appetizer plates so Ellie and Colleen are eating their appetizers off of napkins. This Fridays used to be awesome with service and food looks like its gone down in the quality of service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crystal-lake,,,,,
4,Karen S.,"Oakwood Hills, IL",16,23,,1.0,2013-06-15,"Been going to this Fridays for years.  Cooks are really slow, but liked the food.  Today we went and the service sucked, period.  Waited about 10 minutes for Ashley to ask what we wanted to drink.  The food took forever to come out.  Two sandwiches and soup took about 1/2 hour.  Than Ashley said she'd get me another pop, didn't ask my hubby if he wanted another iced tea.  She walked by us about 6 times before she finally got me another pop.  Than we were done eating and she asked my hubby if he wanted another iced tea.  When we were ready to leave, we had to wait forever for her to give us a check.  My hubby had to ask if we could have our check and she said ""I guess you don't want dessert""!!!!  Good grief, never going back to Fridays!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crystal-lake,,,,,
