41,Jennifer T.,"Schaumburg, IL",256,191,401.0,3.0,2013-07-25,"I've been to this location several times in the past few years with friends and food and service has been decent. Unlike the other reviews, I haven't had any incidence bad enough that drilled its image into my dining experience. But I also didn't have any a-ha moments either.  But my last experience there  was a tad different though. I was with a group of 5 and I always love it when a place has no problem splitting a check, which was the case here. The appetizers were decent and their $16.99 combo menu (appetizer, entre, desert) is a good bargain with decent size dishes.  The most impressive part of that night (and maybe they are trying to turn that around now with these reviews) is that my hostess took my order wrong. I had order the $10 Hibachi Chicken but they gave me the $12  Hibachi Steak on skewers instead. Being that I was so hungry and enthralled by the dish's aroma, I forgot all about my order and ate up. By the time I realized it, it was too late and I figure I will just let the hostess know for the sake of and not about refunds. Then near the end of our dinner, an elder man walked by and asked us how we are-- I think he was the manager. Then without me having to say anything he figured out that my order was switched. In the end, they compliment my meal and it was something I would have paid for because it was an upgrade. I would have gladly pay the $3 difference but having the service made up to me really put the place in a much better light.  So even though I've been here many tines before, I finally have something worthwhile to write about. :). Sorry TGIF for taking so long to get this review up!  4 stars for service, 3.5 stars for quality of food. Too bad there are no halfsies on Yelp.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-darien?start=20,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007
50,George T.,"Woodridge, IL",20,4,4.0,2.0,2013-10-05,"I come here at least once a month because I believe Friday's food is decent and is decently priced.  But every time I get served by Jay, I am disappointed.  His attitude reminds me of a snobbish french waiter.  He makes me feel he doesn't care about you.  I know this is my opinion but I don't get that feeling from any other waiter/waitress there at this location.  Besides that, his service below par.    Tonight I went with my family and we had 5 people and our infant child.   We were seated with two rectangle tables placed together.  Right off the bat, when Jay was serving drinks he would ask for me to reach across to table to grab it simply because he was too lazy to walk to where i was sitting.  Normally this type of thing is fine if i'm sitting in a booth where the waiter cannot reach the other side but with tonight situation I just find it to be laziness.  Jay ended the night too with the same type of laziness, he would ask us to reach and give him our empty plates rather than for him to walk around and grab them.   Lastly on the check I wrote down my phone number because I wanted to get credit for my stripes reward account.  When he processed the payment and came back to the table, I noticed that I did not get a slip for the stripes reward.  I asked him if he processed my stripes reward and without looking at the check, he told me to write down the number.  I informed him I already did and finally he got it taken care of.   I don't know if the managers or owners will read this but I hope my feedback helps.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-darien?start=20,3.0800000000000005,3.0800000000000005,3.0800000000000005,3.0800000000000005,3.0800000000000005

She knew how to give excellent service and was extremely personable. I really wanted to do the all you can eat appetizer limited time special, but instead both my fiancée and I selected the smarter, healthier option. My fiancée selected the Sizzlin Chicken and Spinach and I opted for the Sizzlin Sirloin and Spinach. I was pleasantly surprised at the presentation of my dish, it was gorgeous. A dish of tomato, mozzarella, red onion salad was dressed nicely. A sirloin sat on top of spinach, and was absolutely (surprisingly!) one of the best sirloins I've had. At first I thought the cook was more well than my desired Med rare, but it was perfect. I can't believe each of those tasty dishes was only 410 calories! We will be back.

In an instance when I don't want to put any effort into choosing a meal, TGI Friday's is a pretty safe bet.  Since the Bolingbrook location closed, this is now the nearest location to me. If you didn't already know, I love their baked French onion soup. Every meal begins with their Ahi tuna crisps, and the aforementioned soup. I usually stick with burgers here, my favorite being the New York Stacked Burger. (Cheddar, Assiago, two beef patties, bacon, and thousand island dressing.) I've tried their sandwiches, but without rave reviews. The Ruben was passable, but the French Dip was an abomination, with tough beef and inedibly salty ajus. For desert, the vanilla bean cheesecake is my favorite.  Service here is always top notch, which besides the soup, is always a reason to return!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-darien?start=20,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248

We went for the hawks game 6 and it wasn't overly crowded or loud it was the perfect balance and the food came out fast the amount of food we got for the price was steal!

I have no idea who the busser is and nor do I care, just want to pay for my food and go. As I was looking around not knowing who to look for the ""bartender"" railed two people saying ""we don't handle that"" multiple times. Kind of ridiculous as again, I do not care.

26,Jamie R.,"Elmhurst, IL",3,15,41.0,3.0,2017-02-15,"i'd like to rate MY experience here a 3.  my boyfriend and i came in for valentine's day and we were quickly seated. everything was running smoothly and went fine.  we ordered potatoe skins for the appetizer & they were amazing. we got the beer cheese dipping sauce on the side to try with them, & it was pretty yummy. our food came shortly after. i ordered just your basic bacon cheese burger & fries, and i was very satisfied. it was exactly how i ordered, and imagined it to be. on the other hand, my boyfriend ordered the stacked cheeseburger with barbecue sauce & cheese, NO VEGTABLES, along with fries. when he had received it, there was no sauce, and no cheese. our waiter kind of seemed all over the place and would randomly walk past our table and shout stuff to us which left us confused as to what he was saying. we told him that he wanted sauce & cheese on his burger, our waiter kept making up some what seemed to be lame excuses about how the cheese sauce had onions and sausage or whatever we had said we didn't want on it, and told us the burger originally had no cheese. so we asked for him to bring back just cheese on the side along with the bbq sauce he had wanted. it took him a while to come back, and once he did, he spilled the bbq sauce all over my boyfriend, and brought the cheese sauce WITH the vegetables that he said he DID NOT WANT. our waiter apologized, and brought back some wet towels that didn't seem to help get off the sauce, but also never brought back a new bbq sauce after he just spilt the whole other one all over him.  in my own opinion he did not seem to know what he was doing and was all over the place. i do not think we should have had to pay for that burger because of him not giving us what we asked for and being unsatisfied. he did not give him what he wanted. he would like to rate his experience here as a 2.5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-darien,3.76,3.76,3.76,,3.76

20,Rita B.,"Darien, IL",39,60,74.0,3.0,2017-04-15,Was here yesterday to check out the endless appetizers for 10 bucks. Honestly food wasn't tasty and it took over 20 mins for each order to come out and you're only allowed to start with 2 which makes the waiting time really long in total,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-darien,3.64,3.64,3.64,,3.6400000000000006
24,Thomas M.,"Plainfield, IL",0,9,,1.0,2017-04-21,Wow continuous bad service always. By far the worst managed TGIF I have ever been to.  Waited 20 min just for a beer. Ridiculous and they don't care.

21,Lena P.,"Chicago, IL",4,27,9.0,4.0,2017-06-25,"I had a pretty solid time here. Our waiter, Bob, was a super nice guy and very attentive on a slow Sunday evening. The drinks here were a decent deal for a chain restaurant - their new Boba drinks were pretty darn tasty, and our bartender didn't skimp on the alcohol. The food was really mediocre, though. It came out pretty fast (they weren't at all busy, so it made sense) but my fries were almost cold and tasted old. I had the Southern fried chicken sandwich, which was the blandest thing in the world. It was supposed to be spicy, but it had maybe a drop of really bland sauce. It was hot temperature-wise at least, but so mediocre. Wendy's makes a better chicken sandwich... So it'd be a really good chain restaurant, if they had a better cook.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-darien,3.56,3.56,3.56,,3.5600000000000005

22,Deidre M.,"Darien, IL",15,19,2.0,3.0,2017-07-23,"I thought I would try the endless apps with my family. Not a great idea.  We thought having apps for dinner would be fun, but the serving sizes are super tiny and took awhile to get. They look nothing like the commercial depicts. Also, our drinks were weak and lacked their specific flavor. Overall, this deal is not worth making the trip in. You are better just getting an app with an entree.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-darien,3.52,3.52,3.52,,3.5200000000000005
23,Mujtastik M.,"Brookfield, IL",24,60,1.0,2.0,2017-07-26,Slow service and when I cashed out the waitress took forever to get my change and only gave me a five dollar bill so I had no choice but to leave it as a tip on a $10 bill. They made us very late for work as it is and I couldn't stick around and ask for singles. There was barely anyone in the restaurant and they could barely keep up.

Where did you go on a late night date in Lombard? Where did You go to lick your wounds after the late night date blew up in yo face? We have Darien to console us. The menu is consistently Friday's; and Yeah, I want more Jack Daniel's sauce.  What I really want is my grilled chicken breast and broccoli back on the menu. Sean reminded me of the brilliance of Friday's - 22oz is 25 cents more than the pint. I'm with You TGIF.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-darien,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004
