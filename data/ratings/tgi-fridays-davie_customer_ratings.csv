49,Michael S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",301,414,457.0,1.0,2012-01-23,"Came here on a Saturday night and it was packed. Figured why not, I'm sure appetizers won't be that bad.  Ordered the Jack Daniels chicken strips and the Mediterranean Skewers. Our server brought us chips and salsa. The salsa was warm, not exactly a good start to a meal. The server was very nice and always refilling our drinks (The only good part of this whole dining experience). This is when the meal took a turn for the worst. The appetizers arrived! (DUN DUN DUN). Long not so long story shorter than normal, they sucked. The skewers looked like a 3 year old put them together and then nuked them after dunking them in sauce. And the Jack Daniels strips tasted like they were frozen and nuked. What a waste of time to even consider going here. I can't believe I actually waited 20mins for that horrible meal. I won't be going back to Friday's anytime soon. Extra info: No reservations or Call ahead. LAME.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie?start=60,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148
55,Mary Ann C.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",1298,556,913.0,3.0,2012-02-18,"Stopped in here Monday night.  Let me start by saying I wasn't hungry to begin with so that may be part of the 3 stars.  The waiter was attentive and personable.  He brought my beer right away.  I ordered the 2 for $10. Really just wanted the potstickers but it was only $1. more to get a main course.  The potstickers were plentiful and the platter was nicely decorated with shreaded red and green cabbage.  The dipping sauce was a bit of a disappointment but then again, I am used to very authentic Asian food.  They filling was yummy  but they were not hot enough and not crispy either.  The parmesan crusted flounder was ok, the rice was barely warm, overcooked and tasteless.  The spinach dip others ordered was addictive, the burgers got rave reviews too.  I'm just not so sure I am thanking God for this place!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie?start=60,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38
80,Arly J.,"Hollywood, FL",25,256,263.0,1.0,2012-05-21,we have visited this location several times on a Sunday afternoon after going to the movies and sat at the bar. Both the waitress and the bartendar never have a smile and it always takes us forever to get our drinks and food. It is not busy either when we have gone.  They have a great appetizer deal that runs after 3pm and we usually order a few items. This time it was our nephews birthday and we asked for the brownie obsession and for them to sing happy birthday. One waitress came set the item on the table said happy birthday and asked us if we wanted to sing with her. Very disappointing and the old TGIF atmosphere. I can only imagine how it is when they are full.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie?start=80,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.2440000000000007

Since it was her wish we took the turnpike and headed to this one.  It wasn't a problem, it is clean and not crowded.  Busy, but not crowded.   Once we were seated we decided to share a Berry flavored Margarita.  She got carded (of course) and the server failed to notice the date of birth... it was the day of her birthday.  Oh man... huge fail.  No attention to detail.  (The lady at another place the next day noticed that the previous day was her birthday and mentioned it..) As for the food, the appetizer my little one ordered was so-so, it was pretzel sticks which were good but the cheese dipping sauce wasn't. My black bean burger was pretty good,  the only faux pas, is that when I asked for a spicy or brown mustard all they had was yellow.  Ick. Everyone else enjoyed but didn't love their food - but it IS Friday's after all.  Can't expect more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie?start=60,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444

Pufnstuf would make a good father.  I don't eat bruschetta.  My stylist tells me I should but last time I took his advice I wound up wearing the ugliest blazer to my uncle's birthday party.  Now he won't even look at me.  The napkins at the table were the same kind I have at home.  Now I have to get new napkins because every time I look at them I'm going to think of that bruschetta, then the blazer, then the party, next thing I know I'm sitting in the shower crying my eyes out...AGAIN!  Only this time my pen pal isn't just a phone call away to calm me down.  This meal tonight has taken a toll on me physically and emotionally and I don't think I'll ever go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie?start=80,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.3440000000000003,2.6

I went here this past weekend with a good friend of mine for some drinks and appetizers after a movie. We were seated in the bar area at a high-top table.  To make a long story short, our server was never anywhere to be seen and was incompetent. The table behind us was clearly compromised of employees on their day off and she spend most of her time there flirting. It was very disturbing to watch. Our drinks would have remained empty for the entirety of the evening were it not for a nice bartender who got us new ones He even had to bring our check at the end of the night because we couldn't find her.  My friend even called the manager, (I think his name was Kurt)  over at one point to explain the situation and he basically didn't care. He might have said sorry, his time with us was so brief I don't remember. After telling him the server was never around, our food was missing, and so were the drinks we ordered he said he would ""go find our drinks"" and left.

Filthy. Finally the food comes out and brought by a very nice man. We ask if we can have utensils.  The wonderful waiter comes by after half way throuh the meal and asks how is everything. I asked for napkins. He comes by and throws down a few napkins stretching his body as far as possible from our table. This is possibly the worst ever service I have ever ezperienced. Unreal. The only thing that came quick was our bill and  Brian never asked us if there was anything else.This may be why I haven't been here in at least 2 years. Now I know for sure it's my last.

The time was 830 on a Tuesday night - 4/17/16....I had one request, being veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, it was to be seated in a corner or against a wall as to be able to enjoy dinner with my family. The host in the front tried to sit me in two different tables in the center of the restaurant which is not what I asked for. There were at least 10 to 15 available tables against the wall already set up for people to dine at not even 4 feet from the tables they offered me. When I asked for one of them they told me those sections were closed and they could not help me. Clearly because they had already cleaned the sections even though the restaurant was still open and they did not want the extra work of having to close more sections. Word of the day, HOSPITALITY!!!!!! Upon exiting the establishment because they could not cater to my needs I informed the host the reason I needed a table against the wall or in a corner was because I was a veteran and would not be able to relax. His response was ""sorry but they are closed."" I had a party of 6 people that would have spent a minimum of $200. That is revenue lost for their restaurant. I guess they need some good management in there to better train the staff. I will never go back. I will also inform all vets I know do the same from this day forward!!!!

The staff should be concerned with the customers needs. Perhaps then, they would receive 20%tips.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.1879999999999997,2.0

Our waiter, Mr. Barrowman I think he said his name was so talented. He knew the menu like the back of his hand and took our order without a note pad!! He took really good care of us. He made my little boy Leo's third birthday SO special! He brought us all the food we wanted with out messing up and he was right on time. He also sung our little boy HAPPY BIRTHDAY 4 times! I was so ecstatic. I love this Friday's and have pledged to eat here every Friday from now on! I can't wait to see Mr. Barrowman again so I can thank him for creating such special memories!! THANK YOU FRIDAYS!!!! 6 STARS!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie?start=20,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.356,2.16
19,Heather M.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",132,85,18.0,4.0,2017-05-13,"In reality, my experience was more of a 3.5 star one. However, due to this place getting a lower rating than I think it deserves, I've slightly inflated mine. After being turned away with my vertical ID, I swore to never step foot in a TGI Fridays again. I decided to get over it and get a horizontal ID. I was in need of some reasonably priced drinks and appetizers, and I found myself here. I walked over to the bar and sat down with my boyfriend. It took 5 minutes or so to get noticed, but that gave us time to peruse the cocktail menu. I decided on a Barbados Rum Punch and my boyfriend decided on a House Long Island. I also ordered 2 waters, and reminded him a 2nd time. We got the regular menu and decided on some apps. My boyfriend ordered the Jack Sliders but decided to cancel them in favor of some endless apps. When he put in the request for the order to be cancelled, our bartender disappeared for about 10 minutes and then returned saying he cancelled them. During the time he was gone, my potato skins came out but I still had no water, so I asked a different bartender and he got them to me quickly. My potato skins were good, and had lots of bacon. My boyfriend decided on the potstickers which were pretty good. My drink was good, and my boyfriend's house long island was surprisingly decent. We both ordered second drinks and appetizers- I got the Boba Long Island and Jack Daniels boneless wings, and he got a rum and diet coke and fried pickles. My long island was very good. The popping boba added a nice burst of flavor, and I liked the tall jar it was served in. My boneless wings were OK, didn't really care for them that much. The fried pickles looked like regular fries at first because they were so thin, but they ended up being really good. My boyfriend got a 3rd appetizer (mozzarella sticks) and I didn't taste them, but I think he said they were good. All in all, this was a very redeeming experience. It was the perfect restaurant to just sit and have apps and drinks in. I was able to relax and have good conversation after a long week. I've seen reviews that mention the cleanliness being an issue. I didn't experience that issue, but I didn't use the restroom here. I'm sure I'll come back, and hopefully it will be just as good as this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28

34,Frances F.,"Hollywood, FL",0,3,,1.0,2017-05-18,"Always come to this TGI and never had an issue specially with the service before .. even sometimes we have to wait for 45 mins to be seated we never complain. But tonight made me feel that I don't want to go back to this chain ever again! Service was so horrible, horrible!! Our server JAMES was an ASS! First, when we got seated and he asked what we want to drink.. it was 10 of us, 6 adults 3 kids and an infant (9months) which a total of 10. He was an ASS to tell us ""oh you guys said your 10 but only 9 of you.."" but we just ignore him.. we never like conflict in a restaurant, specially to the waiter who's preparing our food.. but after when the the apps came out (we ordered 2 sampler to share), he sarcastically asked us if we only need 4 plates.. I mean come on!!! Common sense!! How many of us in the table! I don't know if he is that stupid or he is just a pure ASS! He gave us 6 plates so my husband and my sister in law end up eating on a napkin! And when my sister in law asked if the sampler comes with chicken fingers because she got confused with chilis sampler, James told him ""NO that's your chicken right there"" pointing to the buffalo wings where his finger is too close to our food! It's like he almost touch it. It's like he think we're dumb and we don't know what chicken is!. so my husband have to move his hand from our food! Food was ok.. though my ribs came out burn on a side still never complain.. and before we leave the restaurant we ask for a next take out bag for our leftovers he told us ""oh I gave you one already!"" Common sense again. We're asking for extra! Were not gonna ask if we don't need it! He was just lucky because even he treat us like that my brother in law still give him 20%!! Because we are not ASS like him! Because of this we will never come back on this location again!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie?start=20,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

TGI Fridays was right in front of the theater. We came in around 8:30 on a Friday night and it wasn't crowded, at all. My two friends and I parked ourselves at the bar to get fast(er) service. Got our drinks quickly and our food quickly as well. It was Happy Hour, so 6oz glasses of wine were $4 (can't complain about that!) and well drinks were $5. We shared the Chicken Quesadilla and TGI combo appetizers. The combo comes with mozzarella sticks, potato skins and boneless (or traditional) wings. All of which were decent, except the potato skins were a tad tough. The quesadillas were pretty good, better than the combo IMO. My friend got some special burger, can't remember the name - it had 2 chicken wings on the top - and he inhaled it...think he was starving though. To finish ourselves off, we got the Oreo Madness dessert to share, which was okay, but really sweet...a little TOO sweet for my taste. But not bad though. I've been to this chain (other locations) many times before. Service was good, and food was alright. All in all, not a bad spot for quick pre-movie dinner and drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

First off it's always crowded. At least twice I've come here and joined the waiting list and someone who comes in after me gets seated first. I'm sure we all know that frustration. I've come many time where the workers were to busy talking to each other to ice you attention. The food is average but bc it's so crowded and they want you in and out that they sometimes screw up your orders! For someone with severe allergies I can afford a messed up order. Plus side is there's plenty of parking and I've never had a bad drink here. When the bartender makes a wrong drink or to many I've had them bring out the extra drink to our table so that's sweet of them. Also if you come late at night on a weekday when it is not crowded, you usually won't come across these issues.

First, we are seated but we don't see anyone for the first 15 minutes. Finally we order. Eventually we get our drinks. In the meantime, several tables filled up around us and lo and behold, those tables get their food. They eat while we still wait.  Finally, the food arrives. Flat iron steak (decent taste, hopelessly over cooked). Caesar salad was OK, but the Barrel Salmon was an utter disappointment. Zero flavor, lukewarm (no surprise really, given how long we waited).  But the best part was the pretzel appetizer. You know, the one that never arrived.

62,Jenny C.,"Hollywood, FL",0,3,1.0,1.0,2017-09-23,"If I could give no stars I would. I just had the worst experience at this TGIF on Sheridan by cinemark 24. There were 8 in our table but only 6 people ordered. The restaurant was not even full to wait 1.5 hours to receive appetizers. I ordered flat iron steak with mash potato with a side salad. I should have taken a picture but OMG that 8oz steak was way smaller than an iPhone 6. When I received my plate I was appalled. I understand the steak was pre-cut and measured raw but it looks like I got the short end of the last piece of the steak. I asked to speak to the manager (Kevin), not to get a free meal but to advise him that there was no way I was going to pay $20 for a small steak with cheesy mash and old brown stained broccoli on the side. The presentation was horrendous. And when asked to speak to the manager he had a blank face supposedly listening to what I had to say. There was no empathy at all. All he pretty much said there was nothing else he could do because it was prepped and measured before cooking. My husband and I and other family members were like WTF. Both my husband and I have worked in the customer service industry for many years and that was not how to treat a customer. Like no f's were given. I understand it was Saturday night but it's still money coming in but not anymore going forward. Not worth it. Don't waste your time or money.

( cups taper aggressively towards end and have a 1"" base at the bottom)  I ordered the sizzling chicken & shrimp which was just as tasty as I remember however it was so rationed that I didn't have enough cheese to cover the chicken or my shrimp, never mind the peppers ( onions were MIA ). My bf ordered the Broccoli soup, and he said it was tasty butt the broccoli was hard and there was maybe a cup worth of soup in his bowl. We ordered dessert ( I was still hungry ) the Oreo madness and it was plopped on the plate upside down no chocolate drizzle or garnish.. terrible delivery but it was good.  Our waiter wasn't very much help, inattentive but polite.  Dirty tables all around us, when someone did come by to clean they wiped all the table dirt onto the seats and left it there.

I must say the service was terrible. I ordered a simple french onion soup and salad and after waiting for 30 minutes the server comes back to tell me that they dont have french onion soup which he could of found that out as soon as he put the order in. The server then asked me if i will like to order a different soup and i chose the broccoli cheddar soup. After waiting another 10 minutes I received my soup with no salad. Soup was terrible btw straight out of a can into a microwave kind of soup. I then ordered the salmon with broccoli and rice, in which the rice was under cooked and hard and with a side of spinach no broccoli. I had to send that back and i dislike having to do that. By the way my salad never came out and that was the first thing I ordered. I then ordered a bean avocado burger which was ok minus it had uncooked onions all over it and i cant stand raw onions it would of been nice if the manager would of asked me how did I want it prepared since she came over to apologize for the rice being uncooked. But i removed the onions myself and ate it anyways because i was starving. I needed to clean my hands and wipe my mouth as i eat and i had no napkins at my table. I attempted to use the ketchup but my table had a empty bottle. The waiter never checked on me the entire time i was there and the place was close to empty. At the end of the day i had to look for the waiter to ask for my check cause he was nowhere to be found. And i was surprise the they actually charged me for my meal after all i went thru.
