He responded to our awkward silence with ""I'm just playin', but she'll take real good care of you...""  We just sat there, exceptionally confused as to what just happened.  But what made the whole thing weirder was that the ""so-and-so"" who came made some comment about our previous waiter being a ""troublemaker"" but there were also sarcastic undertones in that statement as well. Bottom line:  If it was a shift change, fine, but that was seriously one of the most awkwardly uncomfortable moments I've had at a restaurant.  Note to waitstaff, no the line you want to use with customers if you want them to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dearborn?start=80,1.512,1.512,1.512,1.512,1.512

After waiting in the first spot at the front door for about 20 minutes, we were seated. The waiter arrived after 15 minutes, took drink and food order. We both ordered the burger and fries and 2 soft drinks. The food arrived about 25 minutes later (the drinks came in abut 15) minutes and served by the very unfriendly waitress. I had to send my burger back as it was served very cold. It was brought back to me in about 15 minutes. It seems they just microwaved the burger. It was dry and tasteless. The bun was greasy and gross. I did not eat my meal but still paid for it. And to add insult to injury, when I asked for a refill of my gingerale I was told that there are no free refill :(  Well thanks for the half cup of pop and a glass full of ice.

He returned with our drinks 10 minutes later, and our food 20 minutes after the drinks...that was the last time we saw him. We had been finished eating a solid 10 minutes when we flagged the manager to get our bill so we could pay and leave. He returned with our bill, took our cash and we left. In the whole time we were seated I never once saw any personnel clear a table, at one time I counted 15 dish cover dirty tables, plus the bar was half full of dirty dishes...keep in mind this was late on a Sunday evening. Never have I seen such a filthy mess. As far as the food...our order had set in the pick-up window long enough that the bread on my Ruben was hard and crusted over and the meat where the sandwich had been cut had changed color (this wont happen until it sits for about 15 minutes) Now really I don't expect really great food at a national chain but all and all this was the poorest experience I have ever had.

YES, A BAND AID!!!

Our waitress stopped by a few minutes later to drop off a stack of napkins at which time I asked for silverware, since I ate my flat bread with my hands and thought I may look a little ridiculous picking up a steak and eating it with my hands. My empty plate was sitting there but she chose not to take it. A few minutes later our entrees arrived, in which I was asked to hold my empty flatbread plate while she set my entree plate down. My steak was slightly fatty but my daughters was very fatty and just about as red as mine even though it was suppose to be medium (slight pink, right?). When she came back to check she obviously saw we had an issue and we told her it wasn't done enough so she asked if we would like a new one. We said yes. She then came back with an order of free on the house BBQ wings so my daughter would have something to eat while waiting for her steak. I appreciate the effort too bad she's not a big fan of BBQ so she ate a few to hold her over. Her second steak was much better. We skipped dessert but have some leftover chicken wings and flatbread we get to take home where someone may eat it. Overall my $53.00 (tax and tip included) meal was very unsatisfactory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dearborn?start=80,1.64,1.64,1.64,1.3800000000000003,1.6400000000000001

The booth we sat in was dirty and the walls next to us were filthy. They looked like they hadn't been cleaned in quite a while, with fingerprints and gunk smeared all over them. Lots of crud between our booth and the wall too. After noticing this I looked around the rest of the restaurant and saw the floor was pretty dirty too. It looked like it hadn't been swept or mopped in at least a few days. There were fruit flys buzzing around us as soon as there was food on the table. They stuck around during our entire meal and were quite annoying. I would not come back here because of the uncleanliness.  Service was slow. We came in around noon on a Sunday and the restaurant was sparsely filled.  Our waitress took a while to get to our table but she was nice. She brought us waters while we waited for the drinks we ordered. The bartender took an unreasonable amount of time making our flavored lemonade drinks. We ordered an appetizer that was brought out fairly quickly. Our entrees were served a while after and were delivered hot.

44,Elizabeth H.,"Taylor, MI",20,26,12.0,1.0,2016-03-26,"oh, so having skimmed some of the other reviews, I see that I am not alone. went last night around 11ish to meet an acquaintance at the bar.  Parking lot FULL of pot holes and uneven pavement.   First thing walking in I notice that the clientele has DEFINITELY changed from when Fridays first opened. That was my first warning sign.  Go to the bar, sit, and notice it's basically full. Great. 3 people working the bar. Ok. Person that I hear the most is actually a worker who isn't on the clock I assume since she is so freaking loud. Apparently she is more important as all the staff is deep in conversation. OK.  I got a thing with talking staff... I hate it and in most cases is unacceptable. Anywho, after about a 5 minute wait just talking to the person I came to meet, no acknowledgement from staff, someone, Jasmin, finally comes over and I order a cranberry juice.  That's it. More conversation with girl in the corner. Finally get my drink. OK.  I observe stacked up dirty plates on the counter as well as behind, napkins and wrappers on the floor, like it hasn't been swept in a few hours that the staff continue to step over. SWEEP IT UP, I was so annoyed lol  The off the clock loud girl is still having conversation with staff and a gentleman who is clearly a regular as staff look at his phone.  Acquaintance leaves.  I stay cause I'm out this late might as well eat something. Order basic cheese sticks. Order goes in and I sit. As I am sitting I notice that people who have been there a while due to the stack of dishes finally seem to be getting their orders.  Food is coming out slow. Great.  The couple next to me got boneless wings and they looked hella dry when they came out. It looked like it had sat for a while too cause the sauce was congealed. When she bit into it, she was working at it. Great. My sticks come out, looks fine and are hot. Marinara came with it, I asked the waitress who brought it out if she could bring me ranch since that's what I ordered. She said ok.  I sit. And wait.  I observe her come and go bringing food out to other people. I catch her eye, wave and mouth ranch. Nothing. Ok.  So now I am sitting and waiting again. Jasmin, the girl who took my order is no where to be found. Another waitress behind the bar who didn't help me comes from wherever she was and I ask her for ranch. She goes and brings it. Great.  I look across the way and 3 dudes are looking frustrated cause they have been there for about as long as I have but they haven't even ordered yet! I catch one dudes eye and we roll our eyes at the same time cause...we just know.  So I finish eating. Just want my bill. Jasmin is a busy bee walking around talking, finally took the 3 guys' order, more chit chat. Finally comes over, tell her I want the bill. She brings food out, makes a champagne drink for the off the clock loud co worker, cashes someone else out, and looks at me and I can tell she forgot to get my bill. Brings me my bill, I am already ready with my card but she turns so quick that I am again waiting for her because she decides to make a drink for the server who just got off work. Apparently, this is a regular thing. And he states very clearly that she was paying attention to the wrong people and she needs to hurry up with his drink. Um, customers vs you?? OK.  She takes my card, I sign it and left her the most minimum amount of cash tip I could. And I didn't even WANT to do that. I didn't even care if she and her friends talk about me cause I WILL NOT be back.  If there is any stereotype that holds true of my people, it is at this place and that PISSES me off! No sense of urgency, having conversation when work clearly needs to be done, an I don't care attitude...It is social time here for staff and customers are not priority and it is not what I remember Fridays to be. Quality is nonexistent in staff and service. The 1 is solely for the cheese sticks and because I have to put something. Someone mentioned ghetto in another review and they are right.

61,J H.,"Detroit, MI",0,1,,1.0,2016-12-10,"Our block club, as a last minute decision decided to go to TGIF for our annual luncheon. I mean you can't go wrong with TGIF right? Wrong!  They were short staffed, which was boisterously announced by another patron, and subsequently the mumbles from the waitstaff confirmed this fact.  From the time we walked in the door until the time of our departure, it was downhill. I won't go into the details, because several members from our group will probably fill in those blanks, but I wanted to add the following:  I think more patience and consideration may have been displayed by our group, had the hostess, manager, or waitress etc., informed us (apologetically) that they were understaffed, that there may be a delay as a result, allowing our group to decide to stay or consider an alternative place to dine. That IMHO would have been the considerate thing to do. While I realize most don't want to turn business away, sometimes that's exactly what ends of happening anyway when service is compromised due to absences, etc.  Customers for the most part can deal with a little irregularity if they are leveled with and their experience is typically very favorable.  However, because such courtesy wasn't extended, it has resulted in this bad review, which by the looks of it (based on other reviews), seems to be par-for-the course with this particular location.  Ultimately, something was taken off the bill after a clearly exasperated supervisor, decided that she would shut the complainer up and return to disappointing other customers; who would most likely receive the same 1-star service we received.  More times than not, the overall disposition of employees and energy of the  place is a reflection of the one in charge. There is so much potential for this place, but it seems the ball has been dropped and no one seemingly wishes to pick it up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dearborn?start=40,1.56,1.56,1.56,1.1880000000000002,1.5600000000000003
68,Samantha C.,"Ann Arbor, MI",0,3,,1.0,2016-12-15,I have tried to go to this location 3 different times. The first time I was with a guest from out of town and the service was so terrible and slow I was embarrassed that this was where I chose to eat. The second time I had to send my food back twice because it was undercooked and cold both times it was brought to the table. The last time was today just hoping that things had changed. But sadly I was looked at by three different employees upon entering and waiting to be seated. No one greeted me or said a word. I tried very hard to give this place the benefit of the doubt.

I had shrimp and chicken pasta . It was not hot enough, but cooked well. Soup was broccoli cheese, just strange, cheese not completely melted into the soup.

63,Kelli B.,"Detroit, MI",66,12,6.0,1.0,2017-02-20,"I had the worst service in my entire life and I'm an excellent tipper. I also have never tipped even the worse server. I had to clear my table, ask for water, ask other servers for silverware, and to top it off I was hesitant to get the endless apps due to my server when we did see her advise us that there was NO CHICKEN or substitutes for the bone in. Alcoholic drinks were great and 25mins later we received our appetizer. During the wait a couple set next to us and ordered our same thing after our recommendation. And my husband told the server that he has back issues and could we move to the two booths that were open. She replied NO because your order is at this table as she abruptly walks off.... no water. Back hurting my husband replied maybe our appetizers will come fast and at the same time so we can just eat and leave.. Still no water. Waiting for our apps our ""friends"" to the left are on their 3rd a piece! Their server is on a roll and his side is packed! I got up and located the blonde mgr in the blue shirt as she apologizes saying it's the overload and a lot of new crew members, she'd order our round of apps. 10 mins pass our friends got a new drop off *insulting maybe this man is pulling some strings* I even asked to wrap up my bill and MOVE! No dice. 20mins at this point I had enough! I spoke to another manager and OH our server I didn't get her name until the receipt. Worse. I told the new manager I'm so unhappy and I'm still hungry. My reciept shows apps but I got two on my table. I felt I should have gotten a credit for the lack of. After paying the full bill, I had to order a pizza to feed my family. I would definitely like to receive a call from management. I thought my service would be the same as it is at the Ann Arbor location, but we visited family and we figured all is well. Total 360. Topping it off I paid my bill and I didn't get my original reciept back.

Then they skipped us in line to be seated saying they called our names while I stood next to the hostess the full 45 minutes and they did not call our name. Then they sat us at a table gave us a kids menu with no crayons, I asked about crayons and the hostess had the nerve to say we are out right now because they are in the back.

71,Trina J.,"Dearborn, MI",0,3,,1.0,2017-03-27,"This establishment deserves NO stars. This location is by far the worst location ever! I've been to this restaurant during lunch hours and always felt that the wait for drinks and food are too long. My coworker and I decided to try this location once again on our lunch 3/27/17 hoping that we can get good/fast service this time. When we got there, It was not crowded which worked in our favor. The bartender is usually the same girl, I wish I could remember her name. She's light complected, today she's wearing scalp braids and is on the heavier side. She actually sat us at our table. At first I wasn't keen on her because she came off like she was bothered that we sat at the bar but she eventually warmed up so I figured she was having a ""moment"". Today the same thing happened. After my coworker and I was seated at our table, we remembered that we needed to sit at the bar to take advantage of the Happy Hour prices. So we informed one of the waitresses that we wanted to sit at the bar so we can take advantage of the prices. She responded ""ok"". Once the bartender realized that we were now at the bar, she ignored us for a few minutes and proceeded to help these 3 girls that was there earlier but left out to go smoke. After she took their second drink orders, she comes over to us and asked us ""what is the problem""?. I was immediately confused on the question as I didn't think I was looking like I had a problem so I responded ""There is no problem. We're ready to order"". She then said ""but why did you guys come sit at the bar? I sat yall at a booth because I figured yall wanted a booth"". Usually when I go to a restaurant they ask if we want to sit in the bar area, table or booth. After we expressed to her that we wanted the Happy Hour specials, she told us that we could have stayed in our seats and still got the special and after she informed us, she basically told us to go back to our booths so that's what we did. Then I was irritated. Our original waitress came back and reiterated that someone had misinformed us about bar seating. By that time we had been there for over 35 mins with no water nor the drink order that we put in 20 mins prior. We watched the bartender joke around, sip on her strawberry lemonade, wipe of the counter but never made our drinks. Finally after 45 mins and all we had was water that we we decided to leave. Our waitress saw us getting up to leave and she never came to ask what's the problem nor during our wait she never came to apologize for the long wait. As we were leaving the bartender came from the back and said with an attitude, ""y'all drinks has been sitting at the end of the bar"". That was clearly a lie because we were sitting right next to the bar and no drinks were there. Remind you, we got there at 1:00 and left at 1:45 and all we had was water that came at 1:35. The bartender, nor any of the waitresses seemed to care. Unless you know someone there, you will guarantee to have a horrible experience here. This is obviously where they place the ""almost rejected"" employees. Please choose another location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dearborn?start=40,1.68,1.68,1.68,1.252,1.6800000000000002
30,Rea F.,"Chicago, IL",62,37,6.0,1.0,2017-04-07,"Title of my review for this TGI Fridays: ""SAW 17"" It first started with me ordering online. I never ordered from this location before. But, being a busy mom, wife and nuclear engineer, I place most of my orders online at a multitude of restaurants, including when I travel to different states for business. Based on my usual online ordering experience with other businesses, I perceived my order would be processed with efficiency and alacrity. My family members and I have dietary restrictions which include no dairy and there was no option to exclude dairy via mobile online ordering. No biggie - I do this all the time and I usual just call and state ""no dairy"". This is when the scary movie, ""SAW 17"" began: I called and a gentleman answered. I stated I ordered online and needed to make sure there's no cheese or butter on any of the entrees. The gentleman said hold on and that he had to check with the cooks and then put me on hold. I was on hold for approximately 7 minutes before someone on their end hung up the call. I thought, ""no worries, I'll just call back to confirm"". I called back, a young lady answered the phone. Before I could finish saying my second word, the phone was placed on hold again withOUT the lady on the other end saying anything (cue scary elevator music). I waited for 5 minutes on hold then hung up. I tried calling back several times and someone kept picking up and immediately hanging the phone up. At this point, I'm like ""I must be getting punked by Ashton Kutcher"". So, I gave up calling and we headed to the restaurant. My hubby called on his cell phone, thinking they must have caller id and were avoiding my number. He called within a few minutes of me and someone actually answered and let him talk!!! So he requested no cheese / butter. You'd think that's the end of the scary movie right? Nooooo.  We get to the restaurant and say a prayer before I walked in, not sure of what to expect. I walk in and the restaurant is at about 20% capacity i.e. there's hardly anyone in there. Hmmm, the phone lines clearly weren't busy because of a rush of people flooding the restaurant. I go to bar and my order is ready (this should cover the minimum 1 star rating). There was no cheese on one entree, but butter on another entree. Also, the rice was placed in a sandwich bag on top of the other food in the same container. For some reason, this was only done to one of two entrees that included rice. I showed it to the bartender and he said, ""that's weird. Why would they do that?"" (cue the suspense music). I politely asked for the manager while in direct line of site to the kitchen / staff area and see the manager near the doorway. The bartender told the manager I requested her. That's when she disappeared and I waited over 10 minutes. (Suspense music gets louder) I decided to walk to the entrance of the kitchen doorway and I must have caught the manager off guard because she clearly was intending to walk in a different direction. She was polite enough to stop at my request and walk with me to the bar. I politely, with a smile, explained to her the issues and asked for accommodation. That's when I noticed her back-up / body guards (a.k.a. other staff) roll up to the bar, appearing to be on standby. (Gut-wrenching scary music playing now) The manager, after I asked, told me her name was Maryann Bohm and stated TGI Fridays typically places food in sandwich bags and that it's done at a lot of other restaurants.Yep - she said it with a straight face. I think I lost all the color in my skin when she said that.... I travel 2 - 3 times a month for business over the past 10 years with the same dietary restrictions and never witnessed rice placed in sandwich bags inside a carryout container  -  I've seen pickles placed in sandwich bags, though ;-).  I asked to have the rice placed in a typical carryout container and she obliged.  Yet, I'm terrified at this point and thinking I don't want this experience to get any scarier. So when she offered two free appetizers / dessert cards - I took them with the food and ran!!! I won't use them at this creepy location, though. I will say I appreciate Maryann for at least trying to make amends. However, I now have the unfortunate experience of saying I was in the movie SAW 17. :-(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dearborn,1.68,1.68,1.68,1.3800000000000003,1.6800000000000002

Kitchen just plain out sucked.  We had a group of 14 with two waiters. Place was dirty, bathrooms smelt like raw sewer water. Lady changing a shitty diaper right on the table behind us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dearborn,1.28,1.66,1.66,,1.5080000000000002
10,Shawnse D.,"Taylor, MI",0,2,,1.0,2017-11-12,"I'm not sure if this was a bad night for all the employees but this was a horrible experience and I will not be returning . Yesterday evening my friend and I decided to go to Friday's restaurant with the hopes of good food and a drink . We walked in and the waiters did not greet us for a while so we decided to sit at the bar . While at the bar about 4 waitress or bartenders walked past us and didn't offer us anything . We had to get up and ask someone in take out to assist us. The bartenders were cursing and being unprofessional to one another in front of the customers . A gentleman sitting next to us at the bar received under cooked chicken , another gentleman coming to pick up take out walked out because he was there for 30 mins and his food was not ready even though he called and ordered ahead of time . On top of-the employees being unprofessional, the manager was just as bad . The gentleman sitting next to my friend and I told the manager  about his under cooked food and the manager raised his voice at this man . At that point , I knew it was time to go . The one worker that was helpful and friendly was a woman named Dani, she was really nice and patient.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dearborn?start=20,1.28,1.66,1.66,,1.5080000000000002
31,Jessica P.,"Romulus, MI",0,15,2.0,1.0,2017-12-06,"If I could give them 0 stars, I would. I stopped here with my sister as I wanted a Jack Daniel's burger and a beverage. I usually go to the location in Canton with no problems. I walked in right before 5pm on a Wednesday afternoon. The restaurant was completely empty other than a table that already had their food and bill. A waiter came and seated us and. said he's leaving but someone will be with us soon.  The waitress arrived and we ordered 2 Jack Daniel burgers, cooked different ways. She returns with our waters, we order drinks and they are at our table by 5:05pm. By 5:30pm a few more parties had come into the establishment, ordered and were receiving their appetizers. We had nothing. I tried multiple times to get the waitresses attention to ask but she never looked at us and seemed to avoid walking by out booth. By 5:40 I go to the bar and ask for a manager as I can't get my waitresses attention. 5:45 comes and the manager and waitress come with our burgers, but don't know which burger was cooked which way. I asked the manager if this is normal for your waitress not to know what the cooks made and if 45 minutes is the normal turnaround time when we were the only people in the restaurant for a good 30 minutes. He didn't have much to say. The waitress took our burgers back to ask the cooks and returned them at 5:50 and STILL told us incorrectly which was which and we had to cut them to figure it out. My whole experience was terrible here and I was leaving by 6:15 - more than 1 hr in a place that didn't have many customers for 2 simple burgers. The the quality of the burgers was terrible. If you've had a Jack Daniel's burger, this was nothing like it. There was minimal sauce and the burger was barely put together and cheese not melted...I'm not sure who was running the kitchen. And the fries were cold. I will NEVER step foot in this location again and I highly recommend that you do not either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dearborn,1.28,1.65,1.65,,1.5020000000000002
21,Ashley R.,"Cement City, MI",82,16,,1.0,2017-12-09,"We had a group of 10 people - called ahead to see how king of a wait they had and they told us, ""we have a group of 17 coming in in an hour.. but we can squeeze you in if you come right now.""  We hustled and got there as quick as we could - there was probably 20 people in the whole restaurant. They were dead. They sat us and we sat there for almost 10 minutes without coming to take our drink order.  There was gross food and sauce smeared all over their menus and drink menus. The restaurant was not clean.  Barf. Do not go here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dearborn,1.28,1.64,1.64,,1.4960000000000002

The Bartender (Dre)did more talking to the other five guest in the restaurant while the Supervisor Paris took my order. When I walked in she was eating at the bar, never once washed her hands but fixed drinks.  Not only was the environment unprofessional with several swear words exchanged by employees the lack of concern for the consumers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dearborn,1.6,1.67,1.67,,1.6420000000000003
26,Patricia P.,"Detroit, MI",0,7,1.0,1.0,2017-12-24,"OMG!!!!!! What happen. Haven't been to Friday's in a minute, but was craving some of their Jack Daniels ribs. From the mop smell when you walk through the door, to the rude manager and wait staff, or maybe the fact that the place was empty should have all been red flags. Still try to give them a chance, I wanted those damn ribs that bad. But when they bring out water that is clearly in a dirty cup, it was time to go. What happened to this franchise. Even the one in Southfield is no more than a two star, waiter had on torn up boots, full face of unkept hair. The hair on his head was nappy and not groomed either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dearborn,1.6,1.65,1.65,,1.6300000000000003
