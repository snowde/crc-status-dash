77,Jason Y.,"Newton Highlands, MA",6,9,,1.0,2012-02-25,"Saw the 2 for 20 special so decided to go to try it.  Bad Idea. Worst dining experience ever. Pot stickers were cold, we told the waitress, she came back after 3 minutes with the same plate of pot stickers after reheating it in a microwave...also, one of the pot stickers filling was missing.  We ordered Chicken Burschette and Angus Burger. I think Burger King makes better burger and fries for 1/2 the price. The pasta was disgusting. Chicken tasted like cardboard and pasta was mushy and sauce was tasteless. Never going back again.  This will be my last time going to TGIF.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham?start=80,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002
111,Chris M.,"Pawtucket, RI",31,125,,2.0,2012-02-27,"I guess there really isn't a lot to write considering this is a chain restaurant.  However, I will give a brief review with a surprise ending.. I was here this past Saturday night after attempting to hit a couple of places with friends at Legacy place.  Everywhere in Legacy place was a minimum 90 minute wait, place is not that good, so we took off.  We ended up at Friday's in Dedham on Route 1 and went right for the bar area.  It was pretty dead.  It was busy for about 30-40 minutes (this was at 6 PM) and then it died out (which was fine by us). Anyway, once we sat at the bar we waited about 15 minutes to place our drink order.  Bartender made our drinks but didn't ask us if we wanted menus and promptly scattered to the other end of the bar.  This blond bartender was making drinks for the servers and being a total bitch (although later she did improve, we all have off nights I guess)..  Anyway, finally got our menus and ordered got an order of the boneless barbecue bites and they were bland.  I have had them before and they can be quite tasty.  They were almost cold, sauce lacked taste (almost like it was old) and they were just OK (2 out of 5)..  The food?  HORRIBLE..  I got the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, holy crap did it suck.  First of all, the presentation was abysmal.  The chicken was all the way over to the right side of the plate, I went to move the chicken to the middle of the plate, and there were raviolis sandwiched under the chicken.  The Ravioli's were the saddest looking things I have ever seen, if it was a horse it would be shot and put out of it's misery.  The chicken appeared to just have the bread crumbs dumped on it at the last second as they just fell off when you go to take a bite. Chicken was not cooked evenly, so parts of it were almost raw.  The Raviolis? Well, I contemplated eating my Adidas sneaker before these ravioli's.  They were overcooked badly, stuck together, no taste at all, just gross. Cooks in this place clearly don't care.  My Brother got a burger, WAY overcooked..  I didn't get in to how my friend's things were but they didn't say anything awful so I would have to say they felt their meals were OK (although based on the pathetic experience I had, as well as my Brother's burger, I can not say that with 100% accuracy).. I realize this is a chain place, I know that going in, I don't expect much but did at least expect decent food (even mediocre), it's what I completely expect, they couldn't even accomplish that.   The surprise (drum roll....) I know you are all DYING for it, it is GOOD..  Girlfriend is enjoying her Blue Moon, then (continue drum roll)....  GLASS in her mouth! wohoo!! are you kidding?? Glass must have broken in to the ice bin where the frosty mugs are and no one did anything about it.  NOW to Friday's CREDIT, the blond (who I said was being a bitch) was very attentive, got her a new beer immediately and took the piece of glass to the manager.  The manager instantly came over, apologized, took her drinks (which there had been many) completely off the bill and gave her 5 FREE appetizer cards for any Friday locations.  Manger was VERY polite.  However, they did NOT change the glasses out of the bin where her glass had been pulled from (BIG no no) but it was our last drink and we bolted for the night.   Only go here if you are dying of starvation, would recommend it for drinks with friends (as long as you don't get a hunk of glass in your mouth from your beer mug)..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham?start=100,1.832,1.832,1.832,1.832,1.8320000000000003

If you do come here and get a heavy hispanic female as your waitress, you should ask to be moved to another table with another waiter or waitress.... I forgot her name, but she was a cold, boring, rude, unfriendly, miserable person. She was terrible the entire night, and she was so fake.

85,Erin C.,"Waltham, MA",0,8,,1.0,2013-01-31,Service was very good. Excessive amount of staff for a very slow  Thursday night but they were all polite and friendly. Food was fair - their new mexican salad is typical chain food nothing special. Burgers were good. HOWEVER - the state of the bathrooms was appalling. It was worse then almost any side of the road gas station I've been to. I would NEVER have eaten here if I had seen the state of the bathrooms prior. The smell alone was enough to make my stomach turn...I won't go into details about the rest but I would recommend staying away from this place if the bathroom is any predictor of the cleanliness of the kitchen.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham?start=120,2.24,2.24,2.24,1.8280000000000003,2.24

The person who delivered it got testy when we complained. She said, ""well it's not my fault, I can bring it back and keep it under the heat lamps"". We said, ""No, then it will be all dried out"". To make a long story short............we got the waitress to remake one of them and then a manager came by to say."" Sorry, please give us a chance to get it right next time"". This Company has had about 30 yrs to get it right, this should not happen and he should of made it right then. I was made to feel uncomfortable for complaining and we paid full price.

81,Sue S.,"Watertown, MA",0,1,,1.0,2013-09-08,"We did some shopping in Dedham and decided to stop for a bite in TGIF. They seated us in the bar area. It was cold there and VERY noisy, despite the fact it was not that busy there. The woman bartender was very loud, much more than four people that were entertain by her. The waitress that finally stops by to take our order was not very friendly or attentive. We had some orders from 3 for $15 menu plus 2 soups. After waiting for more than 20 min. and freezing, hoping for at least hot soup, we finally got it. My husband had his chicken soup just OK, but I had to return my chowder, as it arrived COLD and so salty, it was not possible to eat. The small sharing dishes ware VERY small, though 2 small skewers of Angus beef were soft and decent. But other two dishes were much to be desired. When we were done, the waitress did not price our food correctly. We were overcharged! At the end she mentioned that the soup I sent back was supposed to be that salty, according to chef in the kitchen. When I said I know what the good taste should be, as I usually order it from many other places, she said: now I understand why you are being so mad...... We do eat out often, but this one is one of the worst we've been in a while. Do yourself a favor: AVOID.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham?start=120,1.96,1.96,1.96,1.988,1.96

They did not have many choices for dessert. :( Drinks: 5 They have a ton of options and I went for the Pink Punk...something which comes with REAL COTTON CANDY. Most delicious drink ever. Service: 10 Brianna was the best waitress I've ever had. They were about to close, and instead of being grumpy or in a bad mood, she was extremely upbeat, helped with recommendations, always checked to see how we were doing (not in an obnoxious way but every time we needed something she was there).

It appeared that they were extremely short staffed, as our server was bussing tables, but there was no apology for the long wait or any update at any point.  The only saving grace was that our food did not take a lifetime to appear.  The burgers were quite good, but service was just not up to par.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham?start=100,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.7640000000000002,2.0

As I grew up and now live near TGI Fridays I have decided to give it a try on a few occasions and I can say it has gone downhill. We got our appetizer the same time as our entrée which makes no sense! Either way one plate of food is going to get cold which it does and you are then left with a cold plate of wasted money! I should've learned my lesson but I went a few days ago with my boyfriend and we decided to share an appetizer and entrée  and of course it was brought out at the same time luke warm. Tasted like the mashed potato's were the instant mashed that you find at the food store. The steak was not made Med-Rare it was over cooked. And the ribs were semi good but we weren't given enough napkins as every place should know that ribs get messy. It also took our waitress about 20 mins to get us water and then another hour or so to refill our water! My drink was just awful it was very sour and disappointing. We decided to get the brownie obsession which we always would get and when it came out and was smaller than the size of my fist it made me very unhappy. Overall it was a very disappointing ""date night"" left me hungry feeling like I wasted money and time. After writing this review I hope you can save yourself and not waste money. Save the money for somewhere better like Halfway Café in Dedham or Hibachi in Norwood.  TGI Fridays doesn't even deserve a star from me -- If I could give them zero stars I would.

I work in a restaurant and I know what goes on behind the scenes and what it expected of us in how we treat our customers. So when I go to other restaurants I have little to no tolerance of bad service. First thing was that, despite being almost 100% empty, my friend and I still had to wait 10 minutes to be sat. Once we were sat it took another 5 minutes for a waitress to even come to our table and ask for drinks. In my restaurant, we are required to greet customers within 30 seconds of them sitting down..so you can see that 5 minutes felt like an eternity. The waitress finally came and took our drinks and took another 5 minutes to get them back to us. She then took my order and did not write anything down; I asked for a burger with NO cheese. Guess what came back? A burger WITH cheese and it was an expo or busser that brought it to me. I kindly told him that I asked for a burger with no cheese, it was not his fault. Five minutes later, the original waitress came and gave me the burger and did not even apologize. She never asked if I needed a refill..came to check on our table once.

She was even making the ""hurry up"" motion to collect the menus from us as she disappeared somewhere in the back. The broccoli and cheese soup was cold! How do you serve someone cold soup? The mac and cheese wasn't cheesy at all and guess what? That was cold too! She told me it was ""premade"" that way. Last but not least, the side of broccoli with my girlfriend's ribs was cold too.

Then I had to order one from here (I wouldn't have drove back out there......), and it was correct and much more convenient (I live about 10 minutes away). Anyway, they definitely need a renovation, but I'd rather be able to use more than one coupon, have it conveniently located, with great staff (Manager Vicky and Waitress Brianna are both amazing), and great food (that is made right, unlike the Braintree location).

He only continued to dry glasses and intentionally look away. No hello, not even a 'sorry we're closing now because we all want to leave early' but a deliberate cold shoulder. We sat there embarrassed for 10 minutes before I realized they were not going to acknowledge us at all. I am beyond upset and will actively discourage our friends from going to this establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham?start=40,1.72,1.72,1.72,1.6360000000000001,1.7200000000000002

I mean it's not like they hand scrub the cups, so even when a new cup was brought to us,  they were dirty as well. The cups get dunked between 3 sink basins to ""ensure"" cleanliness but that was far from the case. Next, I noticed an employee pouring a new batch of ice into the bucket. Okay cool.

I love going there with my family because we love the food, the atmosphere, and the games.  When you get the menu the prices are really low so you don't have to pay a lot of money for delicious food. If you think that's good, wait until you hear about the food . At T.G.I.Fridays they have lots different food types of food on the menu . My favorite food on the menu are their hot ribs, juicy burgers and soft fries. They also have lots of drinks too.  There is a variety of sodas, juices, slushies, and frozen drinks. My favorite is the blue raspberry coolatta. Now if you think this is my last reason, it is not. The atmosphere is funky. The decoration is so cool. The art on the walls are so artistic and creative. I like how people can listen to music while eating. You can also watch tv while you wait to place your order. When someone comes in the door the light always flashes. Do you like to be entertained? Well they have fun games to play. They have a pool table, video games, and an hockey air table. My favorite game is the hockey air table because the puck moves on air and when someone scores a goal you get a point. 10 points move you to next round.  T.G.I.Fridays is the best restaurant. You and your family can make it fun. They have affordable food that tastes great. The decorations are cool and they have games for all ages to play.

5,Demetrius S.,"Burlington, MA",4,91,41.0,1.0,2017-08-11,Stopped in for Friday night drinks. Sat at the bar. Maybe 12 people total 3 people tending the bar.  Service was terrible.  Took 5 mins just to give me a menu and xlean off the table.  Ordered the new Mai Tai nothing like the picture (no pineapple or cherry garnish like advertised)  Table sticky disgusting  Food was luke warm. The boneless buffalo wings looked awful. Almost as if they just threw Frank's hot sauce on the.  The bar keeps were just laughing and having a good old time. Forgetting other peoples orders.  I have ALWAYS had a good time at Fridays. I will never come back to this 1 EVER,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham,1.92,1.91,1.91,,1.9140000000000001

Parking lot empty at 12:30 on a Beautiful Thursday.  Upon entering, the floor was sticky.  We were seated at a booth near the bar.  SCREAMING toddler in the booth next to us. She was running up and down towards the bathrooms!  DANGEROUS!  Top that off with loud bar blender nearby!  Chicken in chicken Caesar salad was tough and chewy and who puts the root end piece of romaine in the salad? Sweet potato fries tasteless.  Over priced unimpressive passion fruit(?) iced tea. Don't think I'll ever go to a TGIFridays again!  Just a bad experience.  Go to Joe's American Bar across the street instead!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham?start=20,1.72,1.9,1.9,,1.8279999999999998

The food and the service was terrible. Before I explain I want you to know I am not looking for anything for free. I just want you to know how bad the service is there. We ordered our meals. We got our appertisers with our meal not before it the server said ""We have an issue with the cook"" He gave us the food and left. He came back a few minutes later and we told him me wife's meal was not what she ordered. He said ""That's on me I made the mistake"" One of the ladies asked him for salad dressing he said OK. He left and did not come back. She never got the salad dressing. The fellow with us ordered the sandwich with the ajus sauce for dipping. The dipping sauce was onion soup. When the server did come back he said ""Oh I forgot you salad dressing my fault"" We told him about the dipping sauce and he said that was the cooks fault not his. I mentioned about getting the appertisers the same time as the meal and her said "" We are very busy and if I did not do it that way it would of taken an extra half hour"" The place was almost empty and I told him that. Again he blamed it all on the cook. I would like a phone call please about this issue.  Thank you",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham,1.68,1.87,1.87,,1.7940000000000003
120,Carissa R.,"Boston, MA",24,9,,1.0,2017-10-28,"This was the second and last time that we will eat here. If I were to say that the host and waitress were unfriendly, that would be an understatement. They hardly made eye contact with us and could have cared less about giving us good service. My husband and I went for the endless apps, and we waited probably at minimum 10 minutes per app to come out. After the second set of apps came out, our waitress started walking away without even asking if we wanted to order more (they are endless, remember). Each time after that we had to flag her down. She not once asked if we wanted refills on our drinks. It took us about 2 hours to eat 5 sets of apps because the wait time was so long between both service and food and FYI, it was not busy in there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham?start=20,1.52,1.87,1.87,,1.7300000000000004
1,Eric L.,"Canton, MA",66,1,,1.0,2017-11-02,"One of the worst restaurant experience ever. I worked in the restaurant business before and eat out min of 4 nights per week.  Should have picked up the hint when the restaurant was more than 3/4 empty and I had to wait 15 minutes for a table on a Thursday night. They only had 2 servers on duty.  It took a while before she took our order.  My JD chix strips were dry and over cooked. Not fresh. Come on now- that is your signature dish.  Then after about an hour of ordering, my kids Mac & Cheese came with my wife's pasta. My kids are 5 and 3 yr old twins.  Her pasta was not even hot. It was like warm like it's been sitting out for a little bit.   The family finished their meal and my food was not even out yet. I told them to cancel it and my food comes out 20 minutes after everyone else. Reason I wanted to cancel is because it was now ten minutes before eight.  I got there at 6:15pm.  When I voiced my grievance with the supervisor and the waitress,  they could have cared less.  I would be embarrassed to work or manage this place with my experience I received.   Did not even notice the poor ratings till I went to do your review.

8,Nicci A.,"Randolph, MA",0,21,28.0,2.0,2017-11-07,"The Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Pasta at TGIF is delicious. The three times I've had it, it didn't disappoint. I also tasted the fried shrimp and fries from one of my dinner guest. Pass on that. But the chicken tenders were good. The sweet potato fries were good too. I didn't try the ribs, but other dinner guest said they didn't fall off the bone, but were tasty. Now that I got that out the way, DO NOT go to the Dedham MA TGIF. Our party had to ask for a waiter and for someone to take our drink order. That was 1/2 hour after being sat. An hour until our food came. They are slow. AND it's filthy. The floor was sticky. Our table...I had to ask a worker to wipe down from previous guest. I pulled my chair in and something sticky was on my left hand. Finally, there was a dirt stain that got on my skirt that either came from leaning against sink to wash my hands of leaning against table to cut a cake we brought. The darkness isn't for ambience.

119,Michael B.,"West Roxbury, Boston, MA",0,4,4.0,1.0,2017-11-17,"Came here on a Friday night. The place was empty and we still had to wait 10 minuets to be seated. It took our waiter over 20 minuets to acknowledge. I had to stand up and waive for service. When we finally ordered our appetizers, they came out cold. I had to walk to the kitchen to notify a staff member! I even had to go to the bar to get a refill on my beverage after I grew impatient of waiting. The place is definitely understaffed. I will not come back a second time. I would recommend going to Uno's down the street. I got the grilled chicken, it was okay considering had the lowest calorie count (420 cals). The steamed vegetables that come with the meal have no seasoning or anything. My plate was not even warm! The sizzling chicken shrimp was anything but sizzling. The chicken is bland and dry. The bbq chicken salad was iffy. When compared to the same salad you get at Cheesecake Factory, it's a joke. I made it a point to try it and looks more appealing than it tastes. Don't waste your calories on it. There is a first time for everything! I would not consider trying this location out. The fries that came with the chicken tenderers tasted salted cardboard. I am utterly dissatisfied with my meal, waitress, and the atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham?start=20,1.4,1.85,1.85,,1.6700000000000002

I wouldnt let my worst enemy be caught dead in that bathroom. Genuinely disgusting. I dont even like doing reviews but after this expirience i was compelled too. The food was very sub par. My girlfriends chicken was partially undercooked and rubbery and my ""boneless chicken fingers"" was partially freezer burned. I mean really? Wtf?!?!... I will never, ever!

133,Michelle M.,"Norwood, MA",69,3,,1.0,2017-11-19,A friend and i went to this location last night to sit at the bar and have a few apps and drinks. We were greated promptly .. Which was great! But thats all we got. we sat with empty glasses in front of us every single time. We had to flag down the bartender and ask for drinks every time. The bar was dead! There was maybe 4 other parties.. This was the worst experience ive ever had at a bar. We were so annoyed we left and went elsewhere. The male bartender was way more interested on doing flair And sidework rather than asking of we wanted another drink. The female bartender was miserable. Not a smile or interaction in anyway. During our visit a patron ( whom im asuming was an employee) got up from her table and went behind the bar and started making her own drink.. Which she shared w the female bartender. We sat there and watched this woman make herself a drink while we had empty drinks.

When I first starting coming here, it was pretty decent, including employees and service.  However, now it seems like management has been quite careless on the upkeep of this establishment.  Most employees are so unprofessional. ED however, whom is always up front- is always super nice and professional but the staff overall, are much younger in age than their past hires and so they seem to be careless and not very sensitive towards the needs of their customers.  Why 3 stars? Welp, luckily, 8 out of 10 times my ribs are awesome but I do have to agree with my fellow yelpers on this, this establishment needs help, c'mon guys you have the movie theater and Legacy Plaza up the street, something that the Norwood TGI Fridays (which is now closed) did not have!

The only set that clean was our daughters. When we finally got our food it was barely warm. My fries was straight cold. Even though the restaurant was half empty between between 5 and 6. Their credit card machine was broken also so thx god I had cash. The food sucked  balls. I wasn't gonna leave a tip but my wife said it wasn't the waiters fault and it's true but I was still pissed. So I left him the 20% tip. This TGI Fridays sucks monkey balls. It was also half empty so I asked if we could get a closer booth to the t.v so we can watch the Saints and Vikings game since it's NFL PLAYOFFS and the charge person who sat us down said no even though they were half empty.
