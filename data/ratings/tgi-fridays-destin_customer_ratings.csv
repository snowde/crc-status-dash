2,Lani C.,"Crestview, FL",8,3,,1.0,2015-02-15,"Valentine's Day. Hadn't expected super speedy service because of the holiday and was quoted a 25-30 minute wait time. We noticed at least 6 unoccupied tables just within view of the hostess station. When we asked if those tables were reserved, we were told that the wait time wasn't due to lack of seating, but rather a lack of menus??? We only ended up waiting about 20 minutes to be seated which seemed like good fortune. The server greeted us and took our drink orders fairly quickly, then came right back with the drinks and took our app order. After requesting more time to choose our entree she came back about 5 minutes later and we were ready to go. Apps came out in a very reasonable amount of time so we were still very optimistic. At the hour mark the server came out to apologize for the delay in the kitchen, which we expected and weren't concerned about yet. 15 minutes later the food came and mine and my son's orders were wrong. At this point the server said she'd send the manager over to see us as she took our plates to the kitchen. She left my sides for me to eat but took my son's fries so he had nothing except shared food off my husbands plate and half of my sides. My husband sat and ate his meal while we waited, thinking it shouldn't take long to correct. His steak was half medium rare and half well and it was supposed to medium. Not sure how they managed that. My son's jalapeño burger came out 20 minutes later and was completely burnt on the outside. He was starving by then so he ate it anyway, without his drink because the server promised drink refills prior to the return of our food and again when she brought his food. Another server had to push to get our drinks for us because our sever didn't come back to our table until my food was finally ready. My medium rare steak arrived 20-30 minutes after the burger and was completely over done. Burnt on the outside and close to well inside. At that point, 2/3 of us had finished eating, it had been at least 2 hours since we'd been seated, I'd lost my appetite and we were all ready to leave. We then waited a fair bit longer and got to speak to a manager;we couldn't get the check prior to seeing him because the server had disappeared again. He comped my entree because I'd not eaten it but insisted we take it home, tho we would have paid the full amount just to be able to leave at that point. He attributed a completely new kitchen staff to the issues we had. I've never had an issue with this location before, or any Friday's for that matter but wow.

30,George J.,"Montgomery, AL",0,2,,1.0,2015-05-16,"If I could give this place minus-5 stars, I would. We went on a Saturday night for a late dinner, and our food came out late and cold. One person in our party ordered boneless wings to go, but they came bone-in and we sent them back. The bartender came out and actually admitted he was going to give them to someone at the bar who ordered bone-in wings - after they had been on our table and our friend opened them, which is against health code in addition to being rude and disgusting. Then the server cocked an attitude with us when we went to the bar and warned the other customer.  That was just the ending to the worst dining experience any of us have ever had. Our server was very sweet but new and oblivious to the menu. The other servers stood around gossiping about some horribly offensive stuff - including about someone's sexuality - and appeared not to care about their customers.  The real problem is obviously the manager. We heard him tell another table he had ""only 2 quality people"" working that night, apparently as a way of explaining the bad service that table received. Who talks about their employees that way to customers? He also looked like he couldn't be bothered to shower or shave - shirt hanging out, messy hair. First sign should have been half a dozen people on a Saturday, and I've never seen a Fridays that wasn't hopping late on a weekend.

I am on vacation this week with my family and we wanted to grab a quick lunch.  My daughter has a dairy allergy so it is tough picking restaurants she can eat at.  I figured that Friday's would have been a good choice, but was I wrong. The hostess really didn't know what they were doing and spent more time talking with each other than sitting customers. The only item on the kids menu that didn't have dairy in it was their speggetti and it was the worst I have ever eatten.  Neither of my kids or I would eat it.  The meal that I ordered was below fast food quality and took forever to bring out. A girl with a clipboard spent a lot of time flirting with the 3 guys next to us.  She looked over and asked how was everything and didn't really wait for a response before going back to flirting.

So my question to at #TGIFridays what's the damn point. It's better to just let me come in here and serve the food myself and cook the food myself. It would have been a better experience. Then after the whole thing your response is to give me a $2.00 discount. Are you serious. $2.00 doesn't even heal the embarrassing establishment that you are running.

The music was louder than I find comfortable.  It's obvious that the store needs some attention from the manager.  Had we read the on line reviews for this Friday's prior to coming in, we'd have gone elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-destin?start=20,1.4,1.4,1.4,,1.4

17,Annie J.,"Miramar Beach, FL",0,18,,1.0,2015-12-31,"Wow. I'm almost a little angry typing this because of how shitty this restaurant is. We walked in on a Friday night, it was nearly dead, and that should have been our first clue as to how our night would go. We had a party of five, were quickly sat and then everything went downhill. I didn't count how long it took to get drinks, and food and whatnot but the service was slow. Painfully slow. We were at this place for two hours, and we're fast eaters. TWO HOURS. Anyways, after the half hour ordeal it took to get drinks, we ordered an appetizer. The spinach dip was barely warm. Didn't even get close to holding a candle to McGuire's dip. Chips were good, but how can you screw up chips? The server was, quite frankly, an idiot. I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, and she brings out a Pecan Salad. Uhh...what? I politely tell her I didn't order that and she got incredibly defensive and almost rude. Don't blame your mistake on me. We got our correct food after waiting awhile (She blamed it on the kitchen being backed up. A table was sat behind ours and she told them they were having computer issues. Pick a damn excuse and stick to it.) and it was underwhelming. It had obviously been sitting out for awhile, and most of it was, again, barely warm. The best part was the mac and cheese side dish, but for around 10-15 dollars a plate the food is not worth it. The bill was around a hundred dollars. We left as quickly as we could, and did not leave a tip. This is probably the only time we have ever stiffed a server, that is how awful the service was. I know it's a crappy chain restaurant, but I expected a little more besides overpriced food and bad service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-destin,1.32,1.32,1.32,,1.32
23,Toya C.,"Pensacola, FL",3,319,1742.0,3.0,2016-01-03,"Ok food, good service.   I love fridays and most of them have been closing so this was the first time in a few years that I've had the chance to dine here again so needless to say my expectations were high.  Unfortunately, I was let down.   We went on a Saturday night around 7 pm, we had a party of 6 and we were seated quickly.   We were greeted quickly and served our drinks.  Customer service was really good, courteous and friendly.   Now the food was a big let down.  I ordered my usual the jack daniels sampler with a side of broccoli.   The sampler was decent,  the chicken and shrimp were good,  the ribs was a small portion and only warm.   The broccoli was semi warm and kind of hard.  I'm used to soft,  buttery broccoli,  this was not it.  The heads were kind of hard to chew.   My little girl got the chicken tender meal with mandarin orange side and lemonade.   The lemonade was watered down which I didn't mind in her case just stating the facts.   A good decent portion of mandarin oranges and they were good.  The chicken tenders was hot (not spicy hot) but they were a little too crunchy for a 2 year old,  so she didn't really easy it.  Someone else got the sizzling chicken and shrimp meal,  when the plate was brought out it was not sizzling at all,  no noise or steam what so ever.   No military discount here.   Cool decor,  themes.  Partially clean,  the floor where we sat wasn't swept.  I can't attest to the bar or bathroom because I didn't visit them. This place has ample seating,  highchairs for kids,  TVs on the wall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-destin,1.4,1.4,1.4,,1.4
28,Sam R.,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",73,4,,1.0,2016-01-06,"My fiance & I went here after I had gotten off work. We sat in the bar  area & waited 10mins just to get a drink order. Finally our server came around & asked us if we were ready to order. We said no so he left for another 15 mins. We got an app, & for $10 the jack Daniels strips were nothing but crumbs! We both got an order & we requested no cheese on either burger. Got the food & cheese was on it , we had said something to the waitress about it & she said that they made it twice & walked off. Finally after sitting there waiting on our waiter to come back to our table,  he took the burger to the back & just scrapped off the cheese & gave it back to us!!!!!  Told the manager & she said that we would still have to pay for the food.

27,Jayden H.,"Miramar Beach, FL",98,28,,2.0,2016-01-18,"Service was good, food was terrible! I ordered the jack Daniels burger (2 big beef patties, bacon, Monterey Jack cheese, and jack Daniels sauce). it was a huge burger - in the picture. when the burger arrived it was about the smallest burger I've ever eaten. McDonald's and Whataburger have bigger burgers than them. I also ordered sweet potato fries, which were good but they put way too much seasoning on them. Wine was delicious. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. It's not the servers fault- that's why I didn't say anything because it's out of his control, it's just a cheap company serving cheap food for a high price. I'm very disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-destin,1.4,1.4,1.4,,1.4
14,Tim L.,"Richardson, TX",0,21,,1.0,2016-04-02,"Late lunch on Saturday. .. As a national chain we expected close service and food as numerous other locations,  not. This location has obvious management issues, not blaming the folks who work the floor, they obviously have never been trained.  The food was not close quality as other locations,  the service was horrible.  Understanding this is a resort location, if you can't meet standards of the chain,  why are you there? Food was horrible,  service was inadequate.  Initial  waiter Christian good, but never saw him again, had to ask for refills from other staff, when we  waited too long for check,  asked hostess to get our waiter, she indicated Christian had a larger table and would get our check (for 2) when he finished servicing his larger table., nice... Glad Christian had a larger table, hope his tip worked out better than ours. .. Manager you need to train your folks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-destin,1.4,1.4,1.4,,1.4

I had to pop gum after the appetizer, after sipping my drink, and sadly after the entree. The service was good but the most important part was a disaster. I thought we would leave here and head to the beach but the way my stomach was set up after that experience we are headed back to the hotel.

34,Brittany K.,"Mary Esther, FL",0,1,,1.0,2016-05-10,"Pick somewhere else. Restaurant was dead so service was timely and friendly but none of the food was any good really. The burger was slightly burnt, and it was supposed to come with fries but came alone. The salad was bland and room temperature, came with cucumbers when asked to leave them off. Fries were lukewarm. The broccoli soup was really salty. Didn't get a spoon with the soup, or straws with our drinks. Waitress brought the soup on the plate with the burger (instead of the fries I guess) even though the soup was for someone else at the table. When we asked the waitress she awkwardly said no they probably just did it so everything would be easier to carry to us all at once.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-destin?start=20,1.4,1.4,1.4,,1.4

16,Mary M.,"Pensacola, FL",0,1,,1.0,2016-08-21,"Terrible!!!  I don't know why the franchise allows them to operate under their name.  Worst TGIF I have ever been to!  Watched two parties get up and walk out before they received drinks because of service and the entire restaurant may have had 7 tables going including the two that walked out.  We should have followed!!!  Kids....beware of the honey on the chicken tenders.  Pecan crusted chicken on my salad was dark in color and very tough (may have been frozen and then microwaved).  The burger my husband got was very average.....didn't look like the burgers we get in our Pensacola TGIF.  In fact , nothing compared to our Fridays.  Very frustrating spending $80.00 for a family lunch and most of the food was left on the table.   No one ever asked how our meal was.  The only reason they got one star is because I think I had to press one to write this review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-destin,1.64,1.64,1.64,,1.6400000000000001
