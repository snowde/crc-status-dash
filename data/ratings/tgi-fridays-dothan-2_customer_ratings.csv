15,Russ M.,"Birmingham, AL",919,509,21.0,3.0,2012-05-03,Great spot for a quick dinner this evening. TGI Friday's has an open comfy decor with lots of tv's. Menu has tons of options I had a grilled chicken chopped salad. an outstanding choice!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dothan-2,,,,,
16,Jason R.,"Ewa Beach, HI",35,16,1.0,1.0,2013-04-19,"Bad experience. Went a few weeks ago and have been itching to write a review since then.  It was crowded, and  of course its going to be crowded on a Friday night but the service and food sucked even when taking this into consideration.  The floors were filthy; the bathroom as well.  My date had the Jack Daniels Sampler it think it was, and it was horrible. The ribs were dry.  The fried food was dry and greasy at the same time.  The oil it had been cooked in was obviously old and should been changed out some time ago. Never going to this place again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dothan-2,,,,,
19,Ashley W.,"Dothan, AL",0,1,,5.0,2014-01-04,Great place for good food and drinks. The staff is amazing and the hours are so accommodating.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dothan-2,,,,,
14,Jennifer S.,"Enterprise, AL",2,6,,1.0,2015-02-11,"Use to be great food. Not so much anymore. Chicken was so over cooked I didn't eat it. Service was slow they weren't busy at all! Went on weeknight. Manager said its new Cooks in training, maybe they should train them before they start cooking for customers.......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dothan-2,,,,,
8,Brandon S.,"Fort Benning, GA",5,30,57.0,4.0,2015-06-05,"Excellent waitresses, loved the food.  I got the bacon wrapped jalapeños and the French dip sandwich. The jalapeños were not anywhere near as hot as I expected. But the flavor made up for it.  And the sandwich was amazing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dothan-2,,,,,
11,Jean L.,"Tallahassee, FL",132,53,57.0,4.0,2015-12-01,Typical TGI Fridays. Nothing to set it apart from the others.  That's what make it perfect. I can walk into any TGI Fridays and get the same level of service just about every time. The food is cooked and prepared the same way from Miami to Dothan and every where in between.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dothan-2,,,,,
1,Kat D.,"Atlanta, GA",78,149,196.0,4.0,2016-04-09,"This is a very good TGI Fridays.  Our waitress, Amber, was knowledgable, fast, attentive, and energetic.  Our appetizer came out very quickly.  My husband's steak came out correctly.  I had the mahi mahi, which was delicious!  My first beer was a good temperature, but It took a while to get my second beer.  I saw it sitting at the bar for a while until I got it so it was not as cold.  The store looked clean overall, however I noticed they had an 88 health score.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dothan-2,,,,,
13,Katie W.,"Columbia, SC",3,2,,1.0,2016-06-28,"Poor service. Came in for a nice lunch with my sister and was completely ignored. Took our server Kyle 10 minutes to greet us. Took our drink order and lunch order and we left to bathroom and he was on a computer. Watched us leave the bathroom, returned to table still no drinks. Poor excuse of a server as I am one myself. Table sat down next to us, he took their drink and brought them to his other table immediately. Pathetic excuse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dothan-2,,,,,
9,Mervin S.,"Fort Riley, KS",25,6,9.0,2.0,2016-07-08,Poor service!! Poor quality food.  I was there after 1pm they were not busy at all.  The waitress never came back after our food was delivered to see if everything was ok.  My water glass was empty for 12 min before she came back asking if I wanted a refill.  The bread on my sandwich was stale and to tough to bit into,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dothan-2,,,,,
6,Courtney B.,"Dothan, AL",131,124,77.0,5.0,2016-08-26,Can't beat the all you eat apps. 10 bucks for a redic amount of food! Great drinks and specials each night. Key lime shot is amazing!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dothan-2,,,,,
12,J M.,"Enterprise, AL",0,5,,1.0,2016-11-01,I couldn't get past the disgusting menu... proof that people will only work just hard enough to not get fired....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dothan-2,,,,,
7,Mckenna B.,"Tampa, FL",3,26,12.0,2.0,2017-03-05,i'm only rating a two because they played the strokes over the radio. honestly this was so awful. i came here for a birthday party and it took about 30 to receive our drinks after waiting 15 for the waiter to come. i'm currently a vegetarian going vegan so i ordered mashed potatoes and they came with bacon after i asked for no bacon. then they sat down my spinach flatbread which had been sat on a dirty looking plate with barbecue sauce and onions on it. you couldn't see it until you picked up the flatbread so when i bit into it i almost threw up. also i ordered the black been avocado burger and after they gave it to me they decided to tell me that they didn't have any avocado! to top the night off they didn't come back to refill our drinks so i walked up there and asked someone if i should fill them myself.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dothan-2,,,,,
2,Gus E.,"Buckhead, Atlanta, GA",27,116,17.0,3.0,2017-03-28,Ordered the black bean avocado burger with s side of fries.  Burger came out with one small slice of avocado.... 1.... fries were sent back due to the temperature of them.  Waiter was nice.  Probably will not get again. Great place for drinks though!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dothan-2,,,,,
10,Daniel C.,"Dothan, AL",0,2,1.0,4.0,2017-04-06,This is probably one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I like to take my mother there and they are always very very friendly. The food is superb and the service is the same.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dothan-2,,,,,
4,Emma W.,"Monroe, LA",103,1,,1.0,2017-05-21,"They were out of sweet tea, potato skins, pot stickers, guacamole, and most beer. I'm sure they were out of even more. I am beyond disappointed with the service, management, and business as a whole. It didn't seem like anyone knew what was going on. Maybe they will get it together another time, but I don't recommend coming here at all. The food isn't even that great for how expensive it is. Two thumbs down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dothan-2,,,,,
5,Kylie T.,"Dothan, AL",7,4,9.0,5.0,2017-05-31,"Customer service is great! They're all so happy and uplifting! Walking through the door into such a welcoming place is where it begins! The food is amazing, and not to mention their endless appetizers! So good! I would eat here for any occasion. The flow of the restaurant is very nice. I highly recommend!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dothan-2,,,,,
3,Briggy F.,"Utica, MI",44,5,1.0,1.0,2017-09-01,"I visited your store and ordered three drinks, endless apps and three burgers. Our server was very rude and dismissive. She barely greeted us. I was first to order. She said I forgot, what did you want? I said ""an unsweetened iced tea with a lime."" It was quite simple. She really seemed like she didn't want to be there. When we asked what options we had for the endless apps, she told us that the menu changed, and she ""wished she was more familiar with them"" as she guessed the options for us. She was scarcely available. Two other staff brought us our apps. After waiting 45 minutes and no word on our burgers, barely a glimpse of her, I asked the hostess to see what time we were seated. She verified it was at least 45 minutes ago. I told them we were ready for our check as we were no longer hungry and just frustrated. Another server stopped over and asked if we wanted our food to go. We said no because we didn't want to pay for such a terrible experience. The table next to us would be paying the same amount and having half of the frustrations. I still had not seen our server to ask about the burgers, a check, or even a refill. The other server said he would bring us our check. The check was brought to us and I asked for a manager. I asked the manager to please comp our meals (two endless apps and three drinks). She then stated our burgers were never entered into the system, hence the long wait. I asked her again for obvious reason to comp our meal so we could go. She said ""You ate the apps didn't you?"" This insinuated that I was looking for a free meal. Really, I told her it was a gesture of customer service. She took my check and said she could take off one appetizer. Somehow, my bill was still $35.00 for supposedly one endless app and three drinks. I just paid because I was so eager to get out of there. The entire COMPLAINT process took almost twenty minutes. The manager returned approximately ten minutes later (a long time all things considered) and set the check down. Never asked if I needed change and no one checked on us to take our check. At this point I was ready to walk out. Our server made an appearance to the table across from us. Then walked away. I yelled EXCUSE ME and she came over, seeming bothered. I said can I get some change? She looked at me awkwardly and said, FOR WHAT!? I had almost lost it at this point. I admit, condescendingly I responded MY CHECK! She said WHERE? I said it's under the receipt. We wrote our Friday's Rewards number on it (as we forgot because she never asked us.) Our guest had a free dessert he wanted to use as well. But opted against it obviously. This entire experience was less than par and I also do not feel that I should have to compensate FRIDAYS, or the staff $35.00. I am respectfully requesting a refund and hoping a gesture of customer service will be extended. Additionally, I would like to ask for training at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dothan-2,,,,,
0,Rhett B.,"Birmingham, AL",98,228,432.0,4.0,2017-12-30,"I am usually very pleased with Fridays. The menu has a lot of variety and the company seems to be making good deals to draw customers in.  One such deal is a rack of big ribs with slaw and fries for $12.99.  There is a poster with the slogan for this ribs that I think goes ""Bigger. Bolder. Meatier."" I have to say that maybe one of those words is true.  But you get what you pay for.  I went with the Sweet Memphis style that came with a Sweet and bold sauce.  Good thing you got a whole rack of ribs because there wasn't much meat on them.  The taste was ok but some ends were a little too done.  Fries were seasoned and just straight cut fries.  The slaw was creamy, mayo style and I was given like 2 spoonfuls of it.  Customer service was really good as they met my needs by not having to wait a long time for the waiter to come back.  I like Fridays for the variety.  The ribs weren't bad but I would be disappointed if they were not on sale.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dothan-2,,,,,
