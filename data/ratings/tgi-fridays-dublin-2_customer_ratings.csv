19,Liam M.,"Clonsilla, Republic of Ireland",12,9,2.0,5.0,2012-02-23,As I've been a customer for over 7 years now with Fridays the food is always great. The two for €15 menu probably the best deal in blanch.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-2,,,,,
20,Mark K.,"Belfast, United Kingdom",0,11,,4.0,2012-07-16,Always love a TGI! Their burgers are fantastic especially the ultimate range!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-2?start=20,,,,,
14,Vlad O.,"Athlone, Republic of Ireland",55,79,65.0,3.0,2012-08-16,"Came here yesterday with three other friends. As soon as we were seated, maybe about five seconds later, a different waiter came by to take our order. Don't thinks we'd even managed to open our menus at this point. When we did finally decide on the food, it took them between 10-15 mins to bring the drinks just, almost got me to the point of asking the waiter where they were?? The starters came shortly after and the jack daniels wings themselves were great but nowadays you normally get a bowl of lemon water, or even a lemon hand wipe to use after your wings, no such thing here sadly. Had to ask for knives and forks twice! There weren't any when we sat down, and the first time they brought them it was only for 3 people. No idea why. Considering you've got Eddie rockets around the corner and a captain Americas and Nandos opening soon, this is the last place I'll consider coming again. Three stars, but only because the food was pretty decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-2,,,,,
15,Reuben G.,"Dublin 15, Republic of Ireland",23,125,46.0,4.0,2012-08-28,"I have been there many times over the years, though not so much in recent times. Might rectify that. The food is always excellent for the most part. I'm not a fan of their fajitas but I have had worse in Dublin. Jack Daniels ribs all the way though..... they can't be beat. The staff are always attentive and you can almost believe you are getting American style service (as in, actual service). The only downside is that it is quite expensive for what is essentially a novelty steakhouse. This is a little less true since they brought out there €15 for two courses menu., though it's quite limited. The one in Blanchardstown is very convenient and by far my favourite of the ones I have been to. Blackrock is gone and the other one being Stephens green.  There are some new ones now:  Fleet street (never noticed this one), Dundrum, Swords. A great place if a somewhat tired formula these days.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-2,,,,,
16,Luke O.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",8,4,1.0,2.0,2013-07-02,"Cost me and my girlfriend over 70 euro for lunch, 2 starters 2 mains, 2 drinks... Extortionate prices in this economic climate. Plenty of other places to go for lunch these days with far superior food and at a fraction of the price.  Service = average No problem at all paying for quality, but nothing leaves a sour taste in my mouth like being ripped off. Unless something changes(prices,lunch deals,early birds) I will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-2,,,,,
13,Emma B.,"Greenville, SC",104,77,67.0,3.0,2013-10-25,"TGIs. What can you say that hasn't been said before? This is a popular spot for myself and my work colleagues, generally reserved for after pay-day.  The decor is the standard TGIs affair - random interesting paraphernalia dotted around the walls which often helps with the awkward silences often experienced when dining with colleagues. It's clean, cosy, comfortable and nine times out of ten the staff are friendly. The food is okay. Nothing wows me here. My dish of choice is the boneless bites. Generally for lunch I'll just have these and they fill me up. The hot sauce is a standard Franks Red-Hot but it does the trick! The blue cheese dip is good, but not excellent. Often the accompanying celery is a bit on the 'not so fresh' side but it is okay. The mains to me are flavourless. I have it on good authority that the steak is good, but at €24 at a high street chain restaurant, it would bloody want to be. You're in for a shock come cheque if you go for anything other than the €16e set menu of a starter and main or main and dessert. Also, charging your patrons for extra sauce is bad form. You're either a high street chain restaurant or you're not. Free refills are always a bonus, however. Quite annoyed about the fact 5% service charge is included, that should certainly be optional in this case. I go for the boneless bites only as a lunch option, but really feel that as a dinner option, there is much better round at half the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-2,,,,,
12,Lisa W.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",10,19,43.0,3.0,2014-08-28,"TGIs was a favourite of mine for many years, but they recently changed their menu and have removed the majority of things I loved it most for, so I regretfully give it a 3 star review. They were the first place that I knew of that had and perfected Frank's hot sauce buffalo sauce. No matter what I ordered I'd get a side of the sauce. It was particularly great on the boneless bites. They have unfortunately stopped doing the boneless bites and changed their hot sauce. The new hot sauce is ok, but nothing to write home about.  The food is still good quality and tasty, but it's lost it's charm for me since the menu change.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-2,,,,,
11,Carl H.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",0,4,,1.0,2015-02-25,"The service in McDonald's is better... There is very few places I've walked out on due to poor service, unfortunately TGI's was one of them",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-2,,,,,
2,Sarah S.,"Clonsilla, Dublin, Republic of Ireland",63,344,1978.0,3.0,2015-04-16,This review is for cocktails only. Haven't eaten here in years but came here on Holy Thursday for cocktails with one of the girls. Service is fine. Cocktails can be a little slow getting from the bar but when they arrive they're pretty decent.  If you want somewhere to go for cheap enough cocktails this should be on your list of places to go.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-2,,,,,
8,Jessica C.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",27,26,6.0,3.0,2015-11-13,"So over the years my opinion of tgi's has changed. Up to recently, I was not too pushed to go back. I am now glad I did. Sat at the bar and was looked after by a happy and very entertaining barman, with great talent for making great cocktails. Ordered tapas which was perfect for nibbling on. The ultimate long island ice tea is a force to be reckoned with. Try it and love it. Reasonably priced and I will be back to try more cocktails... yay!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-2,,,,,
0,Luana M.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",52,126,128.0,4.0,2015-11-15,"I really like TGI Friday's. Love their burgers, fajitas and drinks. I also like the atmosphere, very welcoming. Their drinks are very reasonable and they have a great selection.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-2,,,,,
3,Icaro S.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",49,89,385.0,3.0,2015-11-29,"This is a place that can rescue you from a dull day. If you are looking for somewhere to go for a decent and generous cocktail this is a great option - not pricey and really tasty. They have a fine selection of food on their menu; burgers, fajitas, nachos, chicken wings... The usual offerings.  They also have a nice little ""tapas"" menu at the bar if you only want a small bit to eat.  Ok so the food isn't amazing but it does the trick We have the franchise back in Brasil and in my opinion they do a better job with the atmosphere and entertainment & i would always be excited to have a night out there.  Here in Ireland I have been in the one at drumdrum and the one in temple bar, it's safe to say that the Blancherstown is by far my favourite with better service, food & decoration",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-2,,,,,
6,Delphine D.,"Clonsilla, Dublin, Republic of Ireland",6,12,9.0,4.0,2015-12-31,Cocktails are the best in Dublin 15 for sure. Food is good and it smells awesome from outside already. That is one of my favorite restaurant. Staff is attentive most of the time.  the place is always packed.  Lots of kids. Not recommended for couples that want to be alone &quiet though!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-2,,,,,
9,Kieran H.,"Dundalk, Republic of Ireland",20,66,333.0,1.0,2016-01-22,"Think I'll be avoiding this restaurant chain. Going to keep it short review too, way over priced for not nice food. Staff were great but it's bad review just for the food the restaurant serve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-2,,,,,
4,Maggie H.,"Savannah, GA",109,351,80.0,3.0,2016-02-04,"This a regular run of the mill TGIFridays. The service in this particular Friday's was very good and our soda glasses were never left empty.  I sure do miss American free refills ;)  I was feeling home sick for crappy fried American junk comfort food and my dinner here hit the spot!  (I'm not being sarcastic) So, if that's what you're in the mood for, head to Friday's!  I also appreciate their cocktail menu.  The only real downfall is that full bloated heavy feeling you get after eating a deep fried meal covered in various fatty sauces.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-2,,,,,
10,karen m.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",0,14,1.0,4.0,2016-02-18,"Another great place to go,chill with mates after work or mostly with the other half before going on to a club,great menu has something for everyone.

5,Eleanor K.,"Dunboyne, Republic of Ireland",10,27,21.0,3.0,2016-02-22,This TGI Friday is very hit and miss. Sometimes its great and sometimes its crap!  Went there on Friday for dinner after work and it was extremely meh.  The waitress was lovely and all the staff were great but the food was average. and the cocktails were equally as exciting as the food.  The whole reason we went there is because I really wanted the cocktail with the oreos that they do 'Barnamint Baileys' think mint chocolate milkshake with alcohol. It's heaven. But when I ordered it the waitress came back and told me they had no oreos left. This from a restaurant that is next door to one of the largest shopping centres in Dublin had no oreos...so I had a mediocre sex on the beach instead.  Summary: Its grand but eddie rockets is better and always has oreos. :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-2,,,,,
7,Lisa J.,"Dublin Northside, Republic of Ireland",234,398,2001.0,3.0,2016-03-09,"The service here was second to none with the most patient waiter that I have ever met!  And he had a lot to deal with on our table of 12 with giddy kids and grumbling adults. The food is ok, not gourmet by any standards but everything that came to our table bar one thing was greeted with hunger and no complaints. The one item that I sent back was a plate of nachos with a sprinkling of cheese and chopped up tomatoes pretending to be salsa and this was because they were asking for €10.50 for about 10 nachos on the plate.  But the waiter was fine and brought some pasta. The delay on the food coming was a bit long but this was to be expected on a Friday evening in a packed restaurant.  My flatbread with pulled pork was delicious and even though the sweet potatoes portion was rather small I was not left hungry at all. The staff even came over to sing happy birthday to my nephew which was funny and cringeworthy at the same time.  I even got video footage to remind him of the day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-2,,,,,
1,Marcus H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,1.0,1.0,2017-05-27,"What a sham of a chain restaurant, went here on a Friday evening visiting from the US it was pretty quiet was greeted by the duty manager and seated, waited a long time for anyone to come over finally I flagged down the same DM who greeted us and he took our order, waited probably 35 minutes for our food during that time had to go to the bar for a beer refill even though our glasses where empty for nearly 15 minutes. Food finally came it's was mehhhh 15euro chicken sandwich just looked thrown together with wilted lettuce and soggy tomato and cold fries, also watched staff walk past a nearby dirty table 10 times without even clearing it, refused to pay the 5% service charge as we received 0 customer service ( I did inform them I normally tip 30% in the US)  Definitely better places around, I blame the breakdown on the annoying duty manager who was singing and being obnoxious, just not very professional. Will definitely never return here",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-2,,,,,
