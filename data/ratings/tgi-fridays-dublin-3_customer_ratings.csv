12,Elisha C.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",58,150,314.0,2.0,2012-09-25,Meh. TGIs is just ok. Food isn't fresh though. Feels like its been sitting around a while and heated up. I used to really like it a few years back. not anymore though when there's so many quality places around to go to instead.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-3,,,,,
5,Ronan M.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",12,49,,4.0,2013-01-07,"This review won't be too long. You only need to keep the following in mind: 1. The food is good, but not great. 2. The staff are good at what they do, but I wouldn't exactly call them attentive. 3. The food is expensive, but not overpriced. (Average cost is about €20 per person) 4. I would recommend this place for a bit of food and a few drinks before going out.  5. The Birthday song they sing is hilarious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-3,,,,,
6,Kevin A.,"Sparks Glencoe, MD",21,28,15.0,3.0,2014-08-30,Food is ok... Service is usually the issue here.  Full house or empty it takes ages to get served...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-3,,,,,
4,Brendan W.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",23,13,2.0,1.0,2014-09-25,"Terrible!  We stopped in for dinner noting that neither of us had been in a few years and we're looking forward to particular dishes we remembered enjoying before. However, things seem to have changed!  Starter: The best starter IMO that they ever had was breaded, fried, stuffed jalapeños. They no longer do it. The started I did order was approx half the portion size it used to be.  Main course : I got the classic American burger. It was a processed patty, was not dressed with any lettuce as advertised and what tomato was on it was one heel of one tomato. Awful.  My GF ordered the most expensive (€25) version of the ribs as they are one her favourite dishes. Firstly, there was no ""ribs"", but instead just one rib which was supplemented with some chips but without the other advertised side(s)  - coleslaw being the one I recall.  We were initially served our food without being given any cuttlery. There was no condiments on the table - I had to ask the people at the next table if I could borrow theirs, etc.  All in all, an awful experience that came with a very punchy price tag.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-3,,,,,
2,Erika G.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",315,201,646.0,1.0,2014-11-14,"Such a bad atmosphere was really cold inside and at 2pm on a weekday the place was empty!! Over priced, tastless food in tiny portions. Waiters pretend to be so happy in their silly uniforms and hats but they never once asked our table was everything ok, even when they returned to find plates still full of food. I was craving the buffalo boneless bites since I had them in TGI fridays in america..but they were nothing like I remembered. For 9 euro you get 6 tiny buffalo bites that are frozen chicken chunks with a tiny slab of sauce and some gone off celery on the side. Mine were also cold and dried up like they were lying there for a while. Id never return here again even if it was for free.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-3,,,,,
1,Riham B.,"San Francisco, CA",208,124,116.0,3.0,2015-01-07,"This place is okay. I liked TGI Fridays growing up back home, but with all the options available in Dublin, this isn't the first place I'd go. The food is okay, the proximity to the Dundrum shopping center is pretty cool, as you can have a bite to eat after shopping.  The service here is really, really slow. We were there pretty late, so the restaurant was a bit empty, and yet our food took forever to be ready. We also had to physically get up and call someone to give us the check, and even then, we had to go back and do this a second time. If there's other options open I'd go for them before heading here. If not, it's fine too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-3,,,,,
0,Val L.,"Naas, Republic of Ireland",71,206,312.0,3.0,2015-08-12,"Although this is a popular restaurant, it was my first time there. It reminded me of Captain American at Grafton Street ( I wonder which one opened first?) The dining area is huge and a  lovely waiter using lots of ''flares'' guided us to one of the table areas designed for small groups, so I believe. The decoration was really cool and I spent some time examining it. Some Marvel stuff + traditional Irish decoration, and little pieces and bits of small things hanging on the walls. The food menu was short but the drinks menu had way more options. Not easy to decide. We ordered nachos as a started (it was good and the portion was big enough).Prices are a bit high. The mains we ordered were... OK. My chicken was good but extremely greasy - cheese cheese cheese everywhere. My friend said his steak was chewing and tasteless.  Because of all the cheese I got full quickly and I couldn't eat up everything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-3,,,,,
3,Breda M.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",2,18,98.0,4.0,2016-04-18,St. Patrick's day 9.15pm they looked after us. Our waiter was a pure professional. We'd definitely go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-3,,,,,
