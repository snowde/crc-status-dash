35,Joan J.,"Durham, NC",0,2,,1.0,2012-01-19,Went last Tuesday night. The restaurant was not particularly busy. Service was soooo... slow.  Server rarely checked on us. They were also having some karaoke type contest where teams were answering trivia questions. It was annoying to listen to if you were not involved.

Food is just OK.  This is never going to be my first pick to go out.  Since I went here with a group of people it took them a few minuets to piece together a couple of tables.  I expected this.  The waitress acted like she did not care, did not want to be here and did not like that we were a large group.  she took our drink orders and came right  back with them. Two minuets later came back for our meal orders. Flash forward 35 minuets later she came out to tell us the kitchen was backed up and was working on our order and she would bring us free baskets of chips & dip since it was taking so long for our order.  10 minuets later she comes out with our meals and no chips and dip.  I ordered the spinach Florentine flatbread which was good and the cheese burger it was just OK.  A few of my friends did not want pickles or tomatoes, but they were on their sandwich.  Both of them were not happy.   In the future, I will only go to TGIF because someone just HAS to go to TGIF Friday's.

13,Diana X.,"Philadelphia, PA",29,593,16.0,2.0,2012-08-16,"Alright food, but not worth the price. I ordered delivery for TGI's and got their $15 special that comes with a dessert, salad, and entree, and it was extremely disappointing. The dragon chicken was subpar, the wedge ""salad"" was literally just a chunk of a head of lettuce half-assedly sprinkled with cheese and some other cheap toppings, and the dessert was meh.  It might be a relatively mid-priced chain restaurant with decent prices, but even with a coupon or special this place is not worth taking your money to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-durham-3?start=20,1.736,1.736,1.736,1.736,1.736

I ordered dinner, and was never given silverware.  It was also near impossible to get more drinks - each time was about a wait of ten minutes.  Then, I received the check, with no pen.  So I had to wait another ten minutes for a pen so I could get out of there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-durham-3?start=20,1.704,1.704,1.704,1.704,1.704

I really didn't want to come here, but my husband did and since he's not a Duke fan and the whole trip was for me I said ok. Well we both wished we wouldn't have went here.  The only pros I can give you is the doors were held open for us when we came and when we left. Also I always order a burger and it was a burger from Fridays. Con: Our server was terrible and my husband and I have both served or are still serving so when I say terrible I MEAN it. He came over never introduced himself, asked for our drink order. He brought them back asked if we were ready, my husband was not, but we ordered fried cheese and he said he'd be right back for our order. He came back with our fried cheese and finally took our order. My husband ordered a side caeser and a special, me the burger. Also then he said is that everything? We go um yes. He brings out the caeser and our meals all at the same time. Goes does everything look ok? We go yes and he never came back. Well things weren't ok, first off it was a regular salad and his special had no mashed potatoes. The server see we finished our meals brings the check over and goes here ya go I'll be back to get that. No would you like any deserts or refills on your drinks? How was your meals, since I never checked on you?  The food was ok. It was a burger from Fridays.  My husband was NOT impressed with his.

Service was slow. The menu is huge and the pictures look great. What you get however will be nothing like the pictures. I had one of the new double stacked burgers. The bun was stale. The fries cold. The actual meat patties were about the size of what you find on a popular fast food double cheeseburger. The taste was horrible, with their new spreads. I removed the toppings and still had a tough time eating it. It is way expensive for what you get. $12 for a burger the size of a fast food double cheeseburger. The restaurant itself was pretty nice, but with slow service and bad food I would not return. Given the choice between this and fast food I will take Mickey D's any day. Just complete crap.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-durham-3?start=20,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
57,Tonya W.,"Durham, NC",0,3,,1.0,2016-03-20,I should have looked at the other reviews before dinning here today.  It took 25 minutes for them to make sweet tea.  They brought one meal out 15 minutes before the rest; they then brought out the chicken and shrimp pasta with no pasta!  The food was sub par!  I do not recommend this restaurant at all!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-durham-3,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
38,Vania W.,"Chapel Hill, NC",321,63,181.0,5.0,2016-04-01,"My friend and I came up with this amazing idea to get endless apps while doing our homework here. It was totally cool with our waitress when we took out our laptops and she even helped us look for an outlet (we didn't find one). Then when my friend and I both ordered the endless apps, she told us she could just put in one order for the both of us. Score!!!  Our favorites were the BBQ chicken flatbread and Mozzarella sticks but honestly, all of the apps tasted great considering we were both paying half the price while getting homework done (yes, we did get work done).  I'm not sure if there's a rule against bringing endless apps To Go but at the end when our laptop batteries were dying and our stomachs were stuffed, our waitress let us put in one final order before giving us To Go boxes.  Needless to say, my friend and I did a little dance when we got back to our car.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-durham-3,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08

5,MS H.,"Cary, NC",0,5,1.0,1.0,2016-05-14,"I won't visit this place again! You need to read all of reviews very carefully before you head out to TGIF at Erwin rd, Durham.  Indeed, I should have looked at the other reviews before dinning here today.  Quickly we got seat, but in 40 minute, we still did not have anything on our table.  When I told the waitress we were leaving, she said ""oh ok, bye."" She did not apologize at all.  We talked with the manager, and his apology did not look sincere and honest. What kind of culture is that? This place does not have ethics in there. It's a shame to have such a low quality restaurant we have in our community. I do not recommend this restaurant at all!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-durham-3?start=20,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16

55,Erin A.,"Simpsonville, SC",60,1,,1.0,2016-10-22,"watched as my entree was delivered to adjacent bar guest. After taking a bite, he realized it wasn't his dish and told the bartender. Server who delivered the meal then said, not to throw it away so it could be re-served. Fast forward 10-15 minutes, still no food. Bartender said it would be right out. 20 more minutes, manager walks by, and we ask about food. He says he will have it right up and not to 'be mad at him.' An hour later, no food. the manager on duty then asks 'what do you want me to do about it?' Hard to believe I was the only person in a two hour time frame who ordered a pasta. The manner in which the manager spoke to my husband was both condescending and ignorant. The blatant disrespect and overall lack of customer service demonstrated by this manager was easily the ugliest display of service I have seen after waiting tables for over 10 years. It's bad when the guests around you are complimenting your patience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-durham-3,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
4,Julissa Q.,"Durham, NC",245,3,,1.0,2016-11-20,"Worst possible customer service I've received in a while. Waitress was great but wasn't a bit familiar with the menu or drink menu. To begin with I order a cosmo my boyfriend orders a beer and I order royal flush shots as well. The BARTENDER comes over and tells me I can't have two drinks. I get that but I wanted shots not drinks. Which is what took me 10mins to explain. After all that explains he finally gets it and asks me what's in a royal flush. I let him know and he then makes ONE royal flush DRINK. She brings it over I let her know hey I wanted shots. She brings it back he then TAKES THE ONE DRINK POURS IT INTO TWO SHOT GLASSES!!!!! And yes I got charged 4 crown shots that were made with ONE DRINK. Insane. I then try again with something new and ask for kamakazi shots he asks me what's in it and then makes the same ONE drink. They were out of almost everything including fireball who runs out of that?! So I really believe they make money by getting off on people. The food also came out really late and was gross compared to the other number of tgis I've been to in charlotte I was disappointed. I let the manager know and instead of taking anything off he says he would ""take care of my food next time"" manager being DAVE. Yes just avoid it all and just don't come here you'll be highly disappointed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-durham-3?start=20,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88

Not only did it take an hour and half to get here, but I was hung up on phone multiple times (one while asking a question), they also forgot to ask for my address. I called multiple time with a constant ringing number, when someone finally did answer they were very unpleasant. Food isn't worth the hassle- try Applebee's instead.

Three days later I realized I left my $300 dollar prescription sunglasses in the booth where I sat.  Since that time I flew 1500 miles away and called back to TGI Fridays. I called a few minutes before they opened and the general manager answered the phone. I told her my situation. She went to look for my glasses and about a minute later came back and said she found them. She then took my mailing address and told me they would be out in the mail today. I asked her how I should pay for the shipping and she said ""we've got it, and  it will be in the mail."" This is up and beyond any normal service.
