14,Jay E.,"Olathe, KS",8,21,17.0,3.0,2012-02-19,"Typical chain sit down.  Nothing spectacular, nothing horrible.  Decent place if you have no other options.  ""Breadsticks"" are just donuts with no sugar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eau-claire,,,,,
15,Cyndi C.,"Altoona, WI",0,7,,1.0,2012-07-03,"Bad night, terrible service, cold food.  2 hours in this place and had to ask for the rest of our meal after getting the bill",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eau-claire,,,,,
12,Patrick K.,"Minneapolis, MN",10,61,1.0,4.0,2012-10-14,"More expensive for the area, but happy hour packs some good drink deals. Have spent several Friday nights here - they run trivia and give away free food/drinks to the winners.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eau-claire,,,,,
11,Cherie' D.,"Menomonie, WI",2,57,12.0,4.0,2013-06-09,"The 2 for $10 is a pretty good deal except the only appetizers you can choose from is mozzarella sticks, spinach florentine flatbread, fried green beans or 1/4 a head of lettuces.  We had an great experience because the server was very friendly but seemed to have an obsession with saying "" Thank you "" cause i counted and she said it 9 times. We showed up for Jack-Daniels burger but you can order a cheeseburger and get a side of Jack-Daniels sauce. (Cheeseburger is on the 2 for $10 deal) The Cheeseburger was a pre-pressed patty but surprisingly had a lot of flavor. The Mozzarella sticks were great but i had the wedge of salad witch i laughed and politely said it was awful, i was asked if i wanted something else i replayed no and later received a free desert card! Being Nice paid off!  This is a typical chain restaurant but naturally the servers make the experience so i'm giving it a 4/5",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eau-claire,,,,,
9,Aaron S.,"Eau Claire, WI",14,9,2.0,3.0,2014-05-02,"Expensive. And pretty good. Their ribs are some of the best in town but they are still only okay. There isn't much for competition. I had the jack Daniels ribs. Be careful with the sauce, it is obnoxiously sweet. And the toppings kind of look like blood clots. But aside from that they were well done and tasted pretty good! The slaw is meh as are the fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eau-claire,,,,,
13,Sarah D.,"Rosemont, IL",0,2,,5.0,2015-04-02,"SERVICE WAS AWESOME. I was blowing my nose and the friendly hostess asked if we needed more napkins to blow her nose, which is maybe gross and should have gone to the bathroom but it was nice either way! the food was great, warm and exactly how I ordered and I COULD JUST RAGE about how lovely the staff was. BEAUTIFUL YOURE ALL BEAUTIFUL. for real though, this place used to suck and now it's gr8 and U will see me again!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eau-claire,,,,,
7,Sandra M.,"Eau Claire, WI",66,34,10.0,1.0,2015-04-25,The waiter was fabulous.... But o cannot give a restaurant a good review due to the great waiter.... The food needed to be sent back.... Cold fries.... Then they brought our new fries HOT but the burger was cold by then..... We came to watch the Bucks vs Bulls game. Again.... Hello... Sports bar.... Can I please watch the sports ???? Without music in the background? That's the main reason my husband and I came to Friday's .... To watch sports and HEAR it as well. BUT it seems to be a trend that it is almost considered rude to ask to watch a game.... They play the music loud and tune down the sports.... I don't get it. I am on the search for a place that ACTUALLY IS a sports bar.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eau-claire,,,,,
10,Ethan E.,"Whitehall, WI",0,1,,5.0,2015-08-04,"Long story: My girlfriend and I work evening hours and we wanted a nice place to eat at late hours of the night. Friday's is the place for me. We came here merely out on a whim because they are open till bar time. The bartenders and managers normally serve the late night hours, but with a great attitude. They all come off friendly as if they love the night life as well. The food is extremely tasty and cooked excellently. I've had no issues with cold food, mistaken orders or anything of the sort. Plus, the new strips program is great for repeat costumers!  I highly suggest the endless appetizers because who cant go wrong with endless boneless wings? Also the drinks are very reasonable and actually have a decent amount of alcohol. Some of the menu items can seem overwhelming, but try some of the ""safe"" items first to see if this is your kind of place. Happy eating!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eau-claire,,,,,
8,Charles R.,"Eau Claire, WI",4,16,4.0,3.0,2016-01-30,"A new two-part TGI Fridays story.  Last night before going to the movie, we had dinner at the TGI Fridays in the mall.  Our server was prompt in bringing our drinks and taking our orders.  Then, things turned awkward.  First, before our meals came, our server came to our table and said that she had brought both our old bill and the new, correct bill (there must have been a mistake).  At first, My wife and I must have had these confused looks, but then I said, ""I know that I may be experiencing memory loss, but I don't think that we have received or eaten our food yet.""  At that time, the server realized that she had brought the bill to the wrong table.  Next, our food was served, and, of course, My wife's entrée came with the wrong sides.  She had ordered something entirely different from what I had ordered, but her chicken came with exactly what I had ordered.  To be fair, I will say that the manager got things straightened away immediately.  My wife is firmly convinced that we are going back soon, but, then, it will be three strikes and they're out (server/order problem the last time we went)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eau-claire,,,,,
6,Melia W.,"Eau Claire, WI",0,16,1.0,3.0,2017-05-12,"Pretty over priced in my opinion, everything tasted good but for the price I expected better, the fish fry was thirty dollars for three pieces of fish!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eau-claire,,,,,
3,Kiya C.,"Eau Claire, WI",29,12,1.0,1.0,2017-06-12,"I came here with my family and our waitress was decent but nothing worth bragging about. We ordered our food and we got it pretty quickly. However, I was given the wrong food. After finally finding our waitress and getting her to come back to our table. When we tried to tell her that I received the wrong plate, she only insisted ""well it's chicken and you ordered chicken."" And she then left. We decided not to make it an issue and are the food, however we all had problems with our dishes. One burger was severely undercooked, my chicken (that I didn't even order) was cold, and the French dip sandwich was so fatty and tough that no one could even eat it.  The waitress was very rude when we tried to say anything, and didn't bring us back change when we paid. The bill was $45 dollars, and we gave her $100 bill and asked if that was okay. She said yes, but then never brought change. We had to find her and ask for our change back.  Will not be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eau-claire,,,,,
4,Donavan B.,"Chicago, IL",0,39,,1.0,2017-06-26,"HORRIBLE salad.......How in the world could they let the salad/lettuce go bad during the day???  In general, Friday's, Chili's, Applebee's are all copies of each other.  They all have decent options on menu.  However, at this location stay away from the salad entree's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eau-claire,,,,,
5,Jenn C.,"Green Bay, WI",0,1,,1.0,2017-07-17,"Incredibly slow service for a Monday afternoon and not busy. It shouldn't take 30min. For a salad and quesadilla. Waitress never came around to check on us, we had to ask another waitress to send ours over. Restaurant is outdated, dirty, stinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eau-claire,,,,,
2,Wendy B.,"Eau Claire, WI",33,1,,1.0,2017-10-28,Poor service.  Stripes member.  Asked for chips and salsa not once... but twice and was told rudely they were coming.  Needless to say they never came the full hour we were there.  Was never asked if we'd like another drink or if we would like to order a meal.  Needless to say... no tip was given.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eau-claire,,,,,
0,Katy V.,"Eau Claire, WI",0,35,46.0,3.0,2017-11-10,Our food was good but cold. My order of ribs came only with fries because they were  out of cold slaw...on Friday at five pm?  Waitress just walked away without offering another option. I called her back and asked if a salad was available and she said she'd bring it right away. When we were just about finished eating she said the salad would be coming right up at which point I told her to forget it.  What's happened to this place?   Cold food and servers that could care less.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eau-claire,,,,,
1,Debra C.,"Chippewa Falls, WI",18,11,6.0,3.0,2017-12-17,"The wait to be seated went fast. The waiter was very nice and personable. I had the pecan crusted chicken salad. The salad was ok except that the bottom of my chicken was charbroiled black. I did tell the waiter and he offered to have another chicken cooked up, but I declined as it would take too long to wait. I just wanted to let the waiter know as this was very black on the one side of chicken. He went and told the manager and the manager stopped by and I showed him the chicken.  He offered again to make another chicken and I declined it as it was too late.  So he said he would take my meal off the bill and also gave me a free dessert to compensate for the burnt chicken.  It was very nice that this was done as not many restaurants would go this length to correct a wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eau-claire,,,,,
