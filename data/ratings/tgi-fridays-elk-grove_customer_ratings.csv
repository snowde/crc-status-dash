197,Curtis W.,"Sacramento, CA",6,31,,4.0,2012-01-14,"I went to TGIF Friday's tonight starving and to say I left full is a understatement. I had the Kansas BBQ Burger and enjoy every bite.  It was cooked to perfection, the onion rings were a very nice touch and the BBQ on the side had me sold(Dipping French Fries into BBQ sauce.....YES PLEASE!) The only thing I didn't like was that everything on the menu was overpriced, I hardly saw anything that was priced under 10 bucks, so come with lots of money.  And I don't know if this was a first time thing, but it seemed like some of the TGI Friday staffer didn't get along, it was the guy always insulting/arguing with someone, when my party was leaving it was him, a female coworker, and some customer.

The second time I came here was this past Friday.  I came in had my name on the wait list, and was told it would be 45 minutes so I waited.  45 minutes went by and I still hadn't been called up.  I go to the host to see what was the hold up and they were unable to find my list, which obviously angered me.  3 other hosts came to the post who took about 15 min to find my name.  So it took 4 people just to find a name on the wait list which is ridiculous and magically 2 min later a table appeared for me to be seated at.  This time I was seated with 1 set of silverware for 2 people.  This time I brought it to the attention of the manager.  Other than that service was good, however I don't see me going back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=160,1.96,1.96,1.96,1.988,1.96

I'm speaking specifically about the steak fries. I couldn't even handle eating it to be honest. But everything else on my plate was excellent. I always get steak. Again, pretty bad customer service. I had to ask for my drink like three different times. I am pretty sure I got the wrong drink on a refill as well.

We waited about 45 minutes, during which we saw several other people leave as well as others decide to stay and wait. After we were called up to be seated, we were taken to a nearly empty seating area. We were told the problem was that something happened in the kitchen and things got backed up so they stopped seating people. It would have been nice if they told people before they waited.  The restaurant was freezing cold. The ribs that I ordered were dried out, like they had been sitting there cooking for a long time. The food was mediocre and got cold quickly as well, not what we were looking for after the other inconveniences. We also listened to other customers complaining to the managers and staff. Our server in particular was great. He wasn't the problem. The management and/or the cooking staff didn't seem to have things under control.

The hostess and waitress were very attentive, I assume this is to make up for the lack of quality in the food and the extremely inflated food prices.  If I had a ""feel-good"" experience, then I don't feel as bad paying out the a$$ for a mediocre salad and warm iced tea.  However, this time I did not. One of my coworkers chose T.G.I. Fridays for her birthday lunch.  Out of respect, we all went along with it.  $12 for a lunch time mediocre salad??  It's lettuce, a few veggies and some sliced chicken.  The price would have been alright if the food was... freaking amazing!  But it wasn't. Before I get into the food... is it weird to anyone else that there are items on the ""lunch"" menu that are the same price as the dinner menu?  Isn't the idea to eat a smaller portion that costs less money?  Not gonna be the case here. Most everyone in my party ordered salads (boring, I know).  The salads were bland and waaayyyy overpriced for what you get.  A total disappointment all around the table.  No pun intended. Complaints:  All of our iced teas came with literally 4 cubes of ice, the salads were blah, my salad didn't have one of the main ingredients that was supposed to be on it... Totally disappointing!

He just chatted with co workers while I waited with my menu closed. Finally, I got up and I went to Outback next door and had a great meal and great service.  Another recent visit I was told the kitchen was ""backed up, and not taking food orders."" Other nights I have had great service here. When its on, its on, and when its off its definitely off. Guess it depends on who is managing or something. The food here is really good for a TGI Friday's. I have been to other locations and this one is great. I wish it was more consistent because I would eat here all the time. Lastly, one last annoying fact BEWARE!! they don't participate in the advertised specials on TV.

It was a Thursday night and my friends and I decided to head to TGI Friday's for late night happy hour. We got there around 9:30 pm and happy hour didn't start until 10 so we chilled at Walgreen's for a bit. When it was HH time, we rushed in and the place was nearly packed. There was one table available, but wasn't cleaned. The server told us she will get right to us and take care of our needs. 10 minutes in and no one helped us. 15 minutes in and no one helped us. 20 MINUTES in and no one helped us. We got pretty frustrated around this time. Then 30 minutes struck and we just didn't care anymore... The server finally came to clean up our table and took our order. She said, ""sorry, we're short on staff, so it's going to take a little longer"". Uhm.. Okay, we understand.  The food part. We ordered potato skins, spinach dip, and 2 orders of buffalo wings. We also ordered 4 beers. It took about a 30 minute wait for our food to come out. The food have no flavor and tastes like frozen crap. Nothing is good here!!! Last but not least, OUR DRINKS NEVER CAME! Drinks should come out before anything yes? Well, it didn't. Our drinks were never even made. We told our server and she said she will get right on it for us. 10 minutes later... Still no drinks made... Angry and frustrated, we just wanted to leave. We went up to her to tell her we don't want our drinks anymore and give us our bill. Turns out she overcharged us for a 3rd order of buffalo wings. WTF? We told her and she took it off our bill.  Overall, this place is horrible. I don't even know why it re-opened. This place needs some serious changes. They need a better trained staff and new management. I don't even know how it's going to last with the attitude and service they provide.

130,S U.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,2.0,2012-07-13,"RECOMMENDED FOR PARTIES 5 OR LESS, if you want food in a more timely manner. I went for a birthday dinner with 15+ attending and I DID like that they gave us an area separate from the rest of the diners. The waiter was super friendly and kept a smile on his face even though he may be dead tired. We came in at 6:30 and were still waiting for more people to show up. We had a good 6+ people in and the waiter helped bring in extra utensils, napkins, plates, condiments and some fruit [to snack on, i guess] on a side table just in case we need them later.  The seating arrangement for our group is 4-5 tables lined together to be one REALLY long table. I sat at one end of the long table and I can barely tell what goes on at the other end. After the waiter came back to take more orders on drinks, our end of the table asked if we can order our food too. We wanted Mel to order her food first since she IS pregnant and the FIRST order should be FIRST made. She also requested to bring hers when its done instead of making everyones and bringing it all out together. Everyone's orders were taken around 7:30. A good while later (Forgot to look at my clock), the waiter came back and said he finally got the order in.. Most of the guys have gotten bored of waiting and decided to go outside to have a smoke/breather/play some games. We had a full table to only 5 who didn't want to go outside. Some of us started joking that we could have drove somewhere else, ordered, ate, and return back before out food would be served. The first 2 plates came out, neither were for Mel. The people who were still outside were called in so we know who those belong to. Few more plates were served and mine came but still not Mel's. It seems that they also served the wrong number of shots and 3 drinks tasted like its watered down to the other end of the table. Mel's food finally came out and 2 plates were still missing. The people still waiting decide to just cancel the order. ----------------------------------- We came in at 6:30. Ordered around 7:30pm and didn't get our food until after 9. Refills were not offered and no plates were taken away until after we decided to move it to a side table. The food was not served in the order it was placed(The order that was on the receipt or when the waiter took our orders.) When we came in, we were hungry and craving for food. By the time the food came, no one at our table really felt like eating anymore. Some friends even left their drinks so they would enjoy it with their meals could not. Their drinks were not cold anymore or separated from liquid density. My boyfriend and friend's plate didn't come at one point and was canceled. One was yet served and we still have to take it when he didn't want it anymore. We checked the items on the receipt and it seems that they overcharged us on the alcohol. So happens that they didnt keep track of how much we had either. ----------------------------- On the side note. I went to the bathroom 3 times. I've seen a party of 6 close to the kitchen and they've waited half as long as we have. We also seen a couple of tables getting their orders before we have and we ordered before them.

74,Yvonne N.,"Sacramento, CA",1409,649,1562.0,3.0,2012-12-09,"So this was my first time eating an actual meal at TGIF in Sacramento instead of the usual appetizers and drinks during happy hour.  My mom had purchased 2 Sacramento Perks deals, which is the only reason why we were there. Ordered the Jack Daniels Rib Eye and Shrimp Scampi for about $22 and the 2 for $14.99 combo with a classic wedge salad and Bruschetta Chicken Pasta.  The steak, cooked medium because my dad likes it cooked, came out pretty tasty.  They sort of cut through the steak to give it more texture, gave it the disguise of being good quality meat.  However, I would rather order my steak elsewhere.  The Jack Daniels sauce was alright for me but my dad wasn't a fan of its sweetness.  Our waitress forgot the mashed potatoes and when it came out, it was very plain.  The Shrimp Scampi, on the other hand, was amazing!  It was seasoned so well and the shrimp were plump.  I'm a big fan of both steak and shrimp (oh gosh, what am I not a big fan of?) and this entree as a whole was just A-OK. As for my wedge salad, I ordered it with thousand island instead of blue cheese so it was drizzled with thousand island but topped with crumbled blue cheese, which was perfect.  The bacon bits finished this salad off so well, I really enjoyed my salad.  The pasta, again, was just A-OK.  The chicken was tender and I enjoyed the charbroiled taste.  The angel hair pasta definitely went better than regular spaghetti pasta.  However, for $14, I'd also rather get my pasta elsewhere! If it isn't for our second Perks deal, I probably won't be back for anything other than happy hour.  TGIF isn't one of my favorite franchises.  However, I am looking forward to using the second deal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=40,2.36,2.36,2.36,2.0920000000000005,2.36

I own a series of restaurants and I would never hire this guy in my place or to even interact what so ever  with customers. This was the final straw. A few months ago I brought my in laws here for dinner and they screwed up 2 out of 4 orders. My wife ordered a pasta with shrimp, and the pasta was still brittle and powder tasting. how do you mess up pasta? well the lady manager they had at that time apologized and took care of us unlike the buffoon Ruben they have now. We forgave so we came back second time. Again, the order was screwed up, the quality was horrible and service greatly lagged. w asked for the check 3 times. So finally we just left money, more than we should have and went home. The final straw. Went a few days ago with our buddy that just completed military service and they screwed up his order. Why cant this place just get it right?! He ordered a steak, all he got was this burnt little square which he literally ate in 2 bites he was so hungry. Our portions were terrible, we left hungry and disappointed. Then they never brought out the 3rd appetizer we ordered but they still charged the combo meal price for it. My friends asked to see the manager and you can just see the disgust in Rubens face that he had to come deal with us. He walked over slammed a menu on the table in there face and tell us exactly what we ordered. Why is he telling us something we already knew? We asked him to fix the bill, he refused and told us what we ordered again and just did not seem to get it. Finally we did not want to deal with him anymore, just paid and said we will never return because of the bad service serving size and quality. Again, he did not care at all, he just walked away in a huff. But before that actually had to balls to say to my buddy that they do not support military discounts after he asked. That is insulting and disgraceful on many accounts. Because of you Ruben not making any effort, we will never be back and you have just cost TGI Fridays loyals to take their business elsewhere. we would rather support mom & pop restaurant anyway.

I was excited to finally try TGI Friday's and when we got there, we sat around wandering if there was a host or so or if it was self seating? Well it was 8 of us so we didn't wanna be rearranging tables or anything. So we waited politely till someone saw us. We was excited to see the host because at this point, We were all so tired to be driving anywhere else so late at night. Well when she came up to us, she unfortunately told us the dinning section was closed, but we could sit at the bar area so we can get happy hour. We finally agreed to sit at the bar area because we were told that they still served everything on the menu and best of all we also got happy hour deals. So the host said we can go seat ourself but I was curious on how we would seat 8 people by ourselves.. I didn't wanna rearrange their furniture and have them all pissy yaknow? But as a server myself i figured I can just give it a try. I Found a few tables that were already put together but unfortunately it still had the previous food plates on all the tables. Great, another wait for them to clear it. Finally like 10 mins later, we finally sat down. At this point half of the party was half asleep. Well we sat ourselves down, looked through the menu and saw that they had some pretty good options so we all cheered up a bit. Then our server came, no welcoming, no introduction or anything. Alright, whatever, it was late, so ill let that pass but keep in mind you won't get acknowledgment if you did a good job because we don't even know your name. So after she came back with our drinks, she was ready to take our orders, but then she broke the bad news to us. They only served appetizers and no longer had entrees. Like seriously? We haven't ate all day and after we was excited for all the delicious options you tell us we can only get appetizers?! Ight. Whatever, we're just hungry. Appetizers came out, no utensils, napkins, plates, nothing. It's okay, we'll just be barbaric and eat with fingers and wipe on our shirts. Well food came out slowly one by one. SURPRISINGLY THE FOOD WAS ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD, or maybe we were just tired and super hungry. Either or will work. But the food and the alcoholic beverages were the only thing that was good. Didn't order a sprite but our waitress mistaken it and brought it out. Didn't wanna give her a hard time and just took it in even though I gave up soda. Well couldn't even drink the soda cuhs it was just carbonated and delouted. No hint of sprite what so ever. Couldn't take more than 2 sips. Well food came out and it was good so we were happy with that. No refills on drinks so we kinda just passed whatever each other had left to whoever was thirsty. I just figured since our server would get gratuity regardless she didn't pay us ANY ATTENTION. OVERALL: FOOD AND MIXED ALCHY DRINKS ARE A GO.

I read across some of the reviews, not seeing anything intriguing let alone special about this place, but we headed out anyways.  The hostess was seating a couple as we walked in so we had to wait a couple minuets before we were seated. The decor? I loved it personally! Don't really know how to describe it but I loved it.  Anyway we were seated, given menu's and told our waitress would be with us shortly. We had time to go over every part of the menu and strike up a pretty awesome conversation. She finally showed and took our drink order. I was a bit confused because we had out menu's closed, and pretty much on the edge of the table, (which I thought was the universal sign for, ""I'm ready to order""). Anyways moving on, drinks ordered, which wasn't from the bar by the way, I ordered a Cherry-Lime Crush(something like that), and the babe a sprite. Took about 10mins to come out, which at that point I THOUGHT she would be taking out dinner order, NOPE WRONG, she walked away. So we sat, and watched her walk past our table 4 times (yup I counted). She finally came and took our order, ""are you ready to order?"" I laughed a bit before placing my order. I ordered the Sedona Black Bean Burger, and the honey ordered the full rack of Jack Daniel's ribs.  SEDONA BLACK BEAN BURGER: 1 word AMAZING!! 1st I would like to say I don't have much to compare it to except for the Costco black bean burger (which are pretty awesome), so with that said, It beat Costco!!. But no really, it was pretty darn yummy! FULL RACK RIBS: I asked the babe how his food was and he said, and i quote ""It's alright, I have had better"". So there ya go, we know men don't lie when it comes to food!!!.. I was gunna leave a 2 dollar tip because that all I thought our waitress deserved but the honey tacked on another 3 dollars.

I ordered a 6 oz steak with some crab meat sauce (wasn't worth it)-- the steak wasn't worth even $5 to be honest. And my sweet potato fries were cold and stiff.  Most horrible part was that the manager was the one that served us our food-- his customer service given to us was just as bad as the waitress as well.

The food and drinks were good but our waitress was not good at all.  I went with two other friends and we were looking to have a few cocktails and have a great time.  Every time we wanted to order something we had to flag our waitress down, she never once asked how our food was or if we needed anything.  The one time she did come to our table without us flagging her down was for her to ask if we wanted our check.  But we were not even done yet, my friend wanted to order another drink.  There were times that we saw the waitresses standing around and socializing and they were not even that busy.  I could see if they were busy then maybe they would have had some reason to not be so attentive but they had no excuse to give us the service that we got.  Then when my friend was going to order a to go sandwich they didn't even have the meat so they were not making that sandwich, so that was just the icing on the cake to make us more irritated.  Before we left we were able to track down the manager and he took a customer review from my friend and then she was given a $30 credit to come back.  I guess we should go back and use the credit but it will not be any time soon.  Hopefully we will have a better experience at our next happy hour outing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=160,2.28,2.27,2.27,1.8280000000000003,2.274
40,Nancy N.,"Sacramento, CA",183,111,29.0,2.0,2013-10-25,"I've never had such horrible service. Every time I come here, it's never a pleasant experience, but last night was one of the worst! I've never had a problem with my drink here, like ever.. Usually it's just the servers who only come by like twice: First to take your order and second to give you the check. Last night my drinks and my waitress was the problem. I ordered two drinks a signature mojito and a midori sour, I don't know if I came on a wrong night or got the wrong bartender, but both drinks tasted like virgin drinks. I know I ordered alcoholic drinks especially since I did have to pull out my id to show. At first I thought it was just weak because I did get the $3 signature mojito. (I'm not much of a drinker, one drink usually gets me going) So I ordered another drink, the midori sour, I downed it and still nothing. I was shocked and a bit upset. I was planning on asking my waitress,  but she was no where to be found. Now that I think of it, she didn't even greet us or tell us her name! A few minutes later I spotted who I believe was the manager and asked him about my drink, I asked how much alcohol there usually is in both drinks and I believe he said a shot each drink. If I knew I would have stuck to the happy hour.. but Ruben (who I think is the manager) was being helpful and gave us a free drink for the inconvenience. After we got our free drink we put the bill out and again where is our waitress? I would understand if it was busy and she couldn't get to us, but this was at 11pm so there wasn't constant customers coming in and out. Honestly I wasn't even upset with our waitress at that time, I was only upset with the drinks which came from the bartender. So I tipped our waitress anyways. This is the main reason why I was sooo upset that I'm writing this review. Not only did I tip, our waitress snatched the bill and walked away without greeting us. Horrible horrible service. I wish I grabbed back my receipt and crossed the tip out or tipped in cash so I can take it back. Two stars because Ruben tried to help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=80,2.28,2.28,2.28,1.8960000000000001,2.28

I couldn't wait for it to be over. When she brought us the bill and asked how everything was, I told her the truth! She got the manager, and he was very professional.

The waitress was nice, and super friendly. I ordered wings, the BBQ and garlic parmesan. I didn't like it. Keep in mind I love wings. And I usually dig both of these flavors but at TGIF I don't really like them. My sister ordered her usual jack Daniels steak which was good. But my favorite was the spinach dip. When you order these make sure to get bread sticks because the two together are bomb. Overall the food was ok. But since I eat here often enough I know what to get to satisfy my appetite.

32,S. Jeff S.,"Stockton, CA",39,43,17.0,1.0,2014-02-24,"I would not recommend this restaurant if you are in a hurry or if you are really hungry. You'll be late for your next appointment and you'll starve to death before your food arrives. Had I read some of these reviews prior to going, I would have been more adamant with my friends that we not go here. We went during that time between lunch and dinner, you know, when it's not very busy at all. Yet when we entered the restaurant there was no one to greet us, and no one acknowledged us for a good 5 minutes. When we finally were seated, they sat us in a fairly cramped boot, despite our telling them that we had a party of 6 coming and despite one of our party members being quite tall. There was a corner circular booth available, but we were still given one of the smaller booths. A few minutes after we were seated, a party of 4 came in and was seated in that much larger booth. Not cool. Our server was Aaron. He definitely sets the gold standard for bad restaurant worker. I don't know if he was just having a bad day, if it was is first day, or if he just didn't like someone in our party, but his service was embarrassing. He hardly ever came to ask us if we needed anything, needed refills, or if everything was good. The few times he did come to get us refills, it took a good 10+ minutes to get a glass of water and lemonade, twice. Another time, he took my glass of water, and returned (after 10+ minutes) with lemonade, which wouldn't be so bad, except I already had one.  One of party members arrived late, when our server came over, he didn't ask if she wanted order, we had to ask for a menu for her. He then didn't return to our table for literally 15+ minutes. By the time our friend got her food, we had all been done with our food for quite a while, however, the plates from our entrees and appetizer remained on the table. We had to ask our server to take them away. The only thing our server was quick in doing was taking our payment. By that time we were no longer being discrete in our talking of the bad service. I think he heard us because he took the drinks off of our tickets. The gesture was too little too late. I'd rather pay for the drinks and have gotten them in a timely manner, and have been attended to in a timely matter, than have gotten free drinks, but been mostly ignored during our time there. 3 of the 6 persons in our party were experiencing TGI Fridays for the first time, needless to say, they will not be eager to return anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=20,2.36,2.24,2.24,1.5400000000000003,2.2880000000000003

I have to give Nina an awesome review bc she took care of us the moment we sat down til all of our friends got there, took care of them, and even after we were done we stayed for a few hours and she checked on us multiple times and brought us water. We definitely appreciated her guest service bc we used those waters after we drank those long islands. All around. Great company, great deal, great time. Great server. Thank you Nina for making our experience here an awesome one. We will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=140,2.24,2.22,2.22,2.004,2.228
102,Star J.,"Sacramento, CA",0,7,2.0,1.0,2014-06-10,"Decided to give this place another chance..its still horrible. Brought my parents here for their 33rd anniversary on a friday night. Ok, I understand its graduation season and its friday night and people want happy hour. But almost a hour wait to be seated? Problem 1. While we had been waiting to be seated for about 45 mins, a couple comes in after us and are promptly seated.  We were told they were seated first because that table could not accomodate a high chair. Sure. Problem 2.  It took almost another hour for the food to come out. Problem 3.  The strawberry lemonades tasted like water. Problem 4.  When the food came out, me and my mother received our plates but my dad did not. Turns out the waiter did not put in his order.  We waited ANOTHER 30 mins for his plate.  By this time, my toddler is screaming and my dad is pissed off.  I ask to speak to the manager. Manager comes out and says my dads meal will be free and that she will not remove the other two meals off the bill.  Look lady, I don't know about you..but when I go out to dinner I expect good service and ALL of my meals to come out TOGETHER.  The meals weren't all that great to begin with.   Problem 5.  That same table they told us that couldn't accomodate a high chair..guess what? There's a couple eating at it with their baby in a high chair!!! We got there at 8pm and didnt't leave until almost 11.  That's an unecessary 3 hours..mind you I had my 16 month old.  I told the manager we weren't paying and walked the hell out.  I don't pay for terrible service, bad food, and to eat separate meals.  My dad ended up eating mcdonalds!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=100,2.12,2.22,2.22,1.5080000000000002,2.18

The ribs was cooked with their Tennessee BBQ sauce which I wasn't a fan of when I ordered the JD sauce. So I called and told the manager what happened, he asked me to bring it back to get a new one.

A few years ago, when it re-opened, my husband and I went here since we used to go with friends all the time before it closed, because the food and service WAS good, but after it reopened it was awful. We sat down and placed our order, at least 25 minutes went by and no food, finally asked the waiter where it was and he went to ""check"". Well 10 minutes later he came back and told us there was a kitchen fire that delayed the food. We were sitting next to the kitchen, there was no commotion of a fire and everyone else in the restaurant was getting their food. Our waiter forgot to enter our order before he went on break. I asked to talk to the manager, which I never have done before. He was a complete jerk and talked very rude and even yelled at me. I asked if he was going to comp a portion of our meal and he told us he could not at all it was against policy. I have worked in the food industry and I am not dumb. He forced us to pay for our drinks and we refused the food that finally came an hour later right after the manager and I finished talking. Now fast forward to today when we went with our two kids, thought we would give it another try since it's been a few years. Service was awful, not to mention the prices skyrocketed! Took the waitress at least 15 minutes to come to the table. Then didn't see her again for 30 minutes, asked for refills and that didn't happen, had to ask again when we could get her attention 10 minutes later then never saw her again.

19,Daniel R.,"Galt, CA",32,11,2.0,1.0,2014-10-11,"Went to TGIF in Elk Grove once when they reopened. Decided to go again today. Absolutely a mistake. Host took 5 minutes to even get to the front, with the phone constantly ringing. Took our waiter another 5 to even show up and get our drinks, who clearly got off her break as she smelled like fresh smoke and cigarettes. Took awhile longer for the drinks to show and they even came with a new waitress. Ordered an appetizer. Figured the trio platter wouldn't be bad (Wings, potatoe skins, and beer pretzels with cheese). Nope. It took a good twenty minutes for it to show and we contemplated just leaving. Eventually it showed up, but lukewarm at best. Also, didn't even show with the cheese to dip the pretzels in.  Food showed up about 2 minutes after that. I informed him about the appetizer and the cold food. The manager stared at me and asked, ""Well what do you want me to do with that (appetizer)?"" I want you to take that nasty excuse back. He ended up comping the appetizer, but nobody once apologized or tried to fix it. The main meal itself was alright and nothing to praise. Nobody should ever go there with good expectations.  The service was a dismally terrible experience, the appetizer was atrocious and the whole experience was a disgrace.

57,M C.,"Sacramento, CA",51,155,4.0,1.0,2014-12-21,"I'm writing this review from Outback Steakhouse, which is right next door. I didn't intend on coming to Outback, seeing as I don't eat beef, but TGIF left me with no choice. We arrived at TGIF at 4:55pm on Sunday 12/21. When we arrived there was a party of 4 waiting ahead of us, but no hostess. We waited until a few minutes after 5pm and were seriously wondering if we should just seat ourselves. At one point, a waitress from the bar came face to face with us waiting, then turned around and went the other way... then the same thing happened from the dining room. Finally, a hostess arrived from the back and seated the party of 4. She came back and told us that it would be 10 minutes longer before she could seat us because they only had ONE server working the entire restaurant and we she was waiting for another server. We asked if we could go to the bar and order a glass of wine while we waited and she said we could as long as we closed out our bill after we left the bar. We proceeded to the bar where there were two bartenders working. We stood there waiting for either of them to acknowledge us for about 10 minutes!  One of the bartenders had his elbow on the bar and was chit-chatting with a customer (who we assumed he knew based on their conversation), and he was about 6 feet from us! After 10 minutes of NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT from either bartender, we'd had enough. The rest of  our party proceeded to the car while I waited to speak with a manager. After explaining our experience to the manager (and explained WHY we were leaving), the manager only offered excuses. The first excuse was that it was ""shift change"", which I explained was no excuse for waiting so long without a hostess... ""shift change"" means nothing to a customer. BE PREPARED. If you have to step in, then do it! Then he told me that there was only one bartender on staff. Then why were there TWO men in TGIF uniforms behind the bar, both of whom completely ignored us???? We literally walked out and went to Outback. Guess what??? We had an awesome dinner there... I usually skip Outback because they are known for steak, but the dinner and service were great and I learned that they had more on their menu than steak... thanks TGIF for turning me on to your neighbor and competitor!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=80,1.92,2.06,2.06,1.7000000000000002,2.004

Prior to the closure, I remember the drinks being amazing, but the food was pretty lackluster.  Fast forward to 2014...I'm impressed by the food and customer service! I ordered the Sizzling Chicken & Cheese (garlic marinated chicken breats over melted cheese, onions, peppers, and mashed potatoes). They weren't kidding about the ""sizzling factor!"" The skillet was so hot that I had to wait 10 minutes before my order was safe to eat. These may be a reason to complain for some, but I'm accustomed to receiving food that is lukewarm (no complaints here). The waitress did a great job of making sure that I didn't burn myself (damn Mc Donald's coffee lawsuit), keeping our glasses' full, and ensuring that we were both satisfied with our meals.

My fiance and I came on New Years Eve 2014 so we were expecting a huge wait but we surprised to see that there was only one other couple waiting for a table. But with that being said we still ended up waiting 15 minutes to get seated. Once we were escorted to our table I was expecting it to be pack with no open tables available because why else would they make us wait 15 minutes? But nope! From what I could see there were at least 4 clean open tables that were not being used but yet there was a crowd gathering at the front waiting to be seated. So I don't know what was up with that. After waiting 15 minutes to be seated we waited another 10 mins for our server to come. She only came because the lady at the front saw us sitting there and asked us if our waitress has helped us yet and we said no. If it had not been for her I bet we would had to wait longer. Once our waitress took our order it took her another 15 minutes just to bring our water...mind you the restaurant isn't even crowded. And we waited another 15 minutes for our food. My fiance ended up picking from the menu that allowed you to get 3 items for 15 dollars. I believe he got the Thai taco, these macaroni that were inside these little meatballs and another item that I can't really explain or remember what they were called. Anyways 10 mins into eating our food my fiance started feeling itchy. He started breaking out in hives and when we got home it got much worst. We have no idea what caused his hives and not once in his 26 years of existence has he gotten hives from eating anything.  Anyways I think it's safe to say that we will NEVER come back.

We went on 3/13/15.We both order a shaker. Double berry mojito shaker and a patron Cosmo Rita shaker. At the same time we order our kid his meal first to come out. Since, all of us were hungry from a far travel from work.  As our drink arrives, I look puzzled. In my mind I'm thinking, ""Didn't it come with a shaker?"" Since, it was my third time coming here I wasn't sure and didn't want to feel stupid if I was wrong.. So I took the drink menu and look at the description again. My husband said, ""Where was the shaker?"" I said it was suppose to come with a shaker. The husband called back our server and asked her where's our shaker. Her reply was ""Um, the bartender must run out of shaker, but, the glass is the same amount"" I look ay my husband face and right away I sense bullshit. There was a table behind us that was looking into the same shaker drink as ours. I overheard the same server  who took our order mentioned that it came with a shaker to the table behind us. The funny part was we order our drinks first. So, how is it they're out???I felt because we are Asian our server wouldn't give a shit anyways like we too stupid to know the difference.  FYI. It doesn't take a smart ass to figure out. When you order a shaker you get a lil bit more.  Ask we took a sip of our drink. We gave each other WTF is this shit face expression. Is this premium liquor been swap out with a non premium liquor? I did not taste one bit of patron. Excuse me, bartender WTF did you put in my drink??? Need a ""operation swill"" for this place. So, husband complain to me. Another server passed by and overheard us saying how horrible the drink was. She was kind to help and let our server know that we didn't like the drinks. We order another drink. Same thing. The BFM I could not taste a hint of patron nor the grand mariner. Husband frozen ultimate margarita was in a F-ING beer/soft drink glassware. (Picture was posted.) Where is the traditional margarita glass?!! You gotta be kidding me. I don't want to make a scene. It wouldn't matter if we order again. Shit wouldn't get better. Husband was so pissed already. Asked if we want to keep our original drinks. I sarcastically smile and said no. That is how bad it was. It was undrinkable. I order a 10oz sirloin steak with broccoli and steak fries. Cooked to medium because hubby doesn't like too cook. I like mines med-well. as, I got my steak it was a size of a 8oz.i  wish I have a scale to weigh it. Damn, our steak was burnt, dry, and it was def not med cooked. Hard to cut. Not worth for $19.50. Broccoli look like mother fucker dropped it on the floor stepped on it and put it back on the plate. I on purposely, flipped it over on the empty plate to show how black it is (not sure if its mold or dirt) our appetizer is a joke. Very tiny size. I wanted to them to cook another steak again but, didn't want to wait another 30 mins. We were starving already. I will never ever return not with my family or friends. Co worker treats I still would not step another foot in there. Food was very awful and so was the drink. Appetizer was OK.

He was looking forward to the ""all you can eat"" appetizers, unfortunately this  ""franchise"" didn't offer the unlimited appetizers as advertised. The service was good but the food was a complete disappointment, mediocre at best. We ordered the 5 appetizers for $23, their tiny portions were not worth the price. The tuna crisps (3 pieces served on 1/2 of a tortilla chip) were over cooked and not seared as the menu stated. The boneless wings were covered in hot sauce probably to hide the fact they were dry and over salted. The only reprise were the Mac n' cheese balls. I have great memories of the French onion soup from the TGIF on Howe Ave, they served it in a mini cast iron pot and draped in cheese. Thinking if this I ordered a bowl, needless to say it was one of the worst French onion soups I've ever had. The serving listed as a bowl was actually the size of a cup. This version was extremely salty and tasted like it was made from a dry soup mix in fact it tasted as if it weren't mixed throughly.  I would have preferred a packet Lipton onion soup to this concoction. My daughter ordered the kids marinara on penne pasta, however what she got was marinara and water on angel hair pasta. Not sure if the know what penne is. It was so water logged that I ended up pouring out 1/2 cup of water from her bowl before she could eat it. Perhaps they should drain the pasta before they serve it.

63,Beccs V.,"Sacramento, CA",0,38,2.0,1.0,2015-03-31,"I was here yesterday around 5ish -6? And I'd have to say what happened to this place? There was soo many workers just walking around and yet no one to help us. Stood at the door for about 5-7mins before the hostess got off the phone and actually greeted us. She sat us down and brought our waters over. There was about 3 tables that were already sitting and they kept sitting everyone so close even thought there was plenty of tables open. Our waiter came to our table and asked for our order, we gave him our order and he left. Never checking back on us until he brought out food out. He did however refill our drinks without us having to ask. He seemed a bit all over the place and not very organized. Food was bland, not as flavorful as it use to be. I don't think I will be coming here again unless it was just for happy hour at the bar. Also so many crying kids! Ruined my dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=40,1.88,2.03,2.03,,1.97
1,Ashley C.,"Sacramento, CA",393,783,4211.0,4.0,2015-04-01,"From my past experiences, I would've given 2 or 3 stars for TGI Friday's. But this review is just for our most recent visit, and it was surprisingly not bad! We went on a Sunday evening and it wasn't crowded. Service was quick unlike other times I've eaten here. The only downside of this visit - it took a good few minutes for a host to even come to the front to seat us. No apology for the wait at all.  I ordered the appetizer combo plate with boneless garlic Parmesan wings, potato skins, and pretzels. The wings were bland and I only ate one. The potato skins were hot and yummy as always. But the winner was definitely the pretzel! It was soft and warm, and who doesn't love pretzels?!  Friday's still wouldn't be my first choice for dinner but I was pleasantly surprised on our last visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove,2.0,2.04,2.04,,2.024

Opted out for the bar seating because wasn't interested in Happy Hour so we sat in the main restaurant. On this side, service was really slow. I think the manager ended up serving us.  Side- Mac & Cheese is delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=20,1.92,2.04,2.04,,1.992

Having been a server for a few of these restaurants I can tell you first hand that there's nothing more annoying than a self-entitled, ""know-it-all"" demanding a well-done to taste exactly like a tender juicy authentic Wagyu rib eye...please, someone help this guy... Sit down, drink your beer, and be content with that 2 to 3-star meal your eating. You're in a chain. Rate or pay attention to other things like your hardworking server who's ever smiling even though she's drowning in a sea of irrationality and impatience, not to mention her tuition. You're in a chain. Just relax ~ what the heck are you looking for?? Caviar and truffles?! You...are in a freakin' chain.  I wanted to try their 3 for $15 since I couldn't decide: - Ahi Tuna Crisps - blackened Ahi Tuna slices on tortilla chips with house-made guacamole, jalapeños, Sriracha sauce and Avocado vinaigrette, drizzled with cucumber wasabi ranch (three to an order) - Corned Beef & Swiss Sliders - two deli sliders on a pretzel roll with caramelized onions, Dijon mustard and mayonnaise - Thai Pork Tacos - soft corn tortillas with Thai marinated pulled pork, Sriracha aioli, ginger-lime slaw and hoisin sauce (three to an order) The tuna crisps were good. The pork tacos were great. The pretzel buns on those sliders were my favorite part of the whole meal. Our server, I didn't catch her name, was awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove,2.0,2.06,2.06,,2.036
105,Nicole L.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,30,,1.0,2015-04-09,"First if I could put 0 stars that would be my choice. We went for dinner based on specials on the TGIF website none of which are available at this location. Our drinks took at least 10+ minutes as the bartender was to busy talking with other employees. While waiting a woman with two children sat at the booth next to us ( we were in the bar) her wine glass filled by the chatty bartender was large and very full. Not what the normal customers get.  Finally our drinks appeared we ordered a appetizer and dinner the appetizer was the only item that tasted good.  My salad with pecan crusted chicken was awful the chicken was so over cooked I could hardly swallow it. My husband steak and ribs well the steak tasted like it was cooked in fish oil. The ribs were not the same as before with good bbq sauce the new sauce is horrible. His mac and cheese was noodle with bread crumbs but no cheese. I ordered desert and the cake was so dry it tasted like it had been stored frozen for 10 years. We did complain to the waitress who did give us great service ( she can't help what they give her to serve) and then we talked to the manager on duty. She was good and listened and explained on going problems. She did credit our bill for the awful meal. But we will never go back. After two meals a year apart and they only got worse well there will not be a third time. Finally back to the woman with two kids. She was obviously a employee or good friend of the bartender. She had at least two of the fullest wine glasses I have every seen (they were big glasses) and appetizers. Plus she never paid a bill. I guess friday's  lets employees or friends of employees eat and drink free, then drive drunk with 2 kids. I really wish I had called the elk grove pd had reported her for DUI.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=100,2.0,2.06,2.06,,2.036
30,Nathen C.,"Elk Grove, CA",7,15,1.0,1.0,2015-04-10,"I really hate to write this review, because my family and I used to really like this place.  Over the last year, we have only been to this particular TGIF 4 times.  We used to go more frequently, but the service kept pushing us in the other direction.  Last night I placed an order... My first takeout from them.  My wife and I had hectic work shifts yesterday, so we wanted a nice and quiet meal that we wouldn't have to prepare ourselves.  We tried calling TGIF for over an hour to place our order, before I decided to just go ahead and visit them to order the meal instead.  I showed up and the parking lot was COMPLETELY packed.  I waited for another 5 minutes, before I could get a parking space, while trying to beat others to it.  I know that's common for dinner hours, but it just added to the frustration of the situation.   I went up to the receptionist guy and asked if I could order take out. He told me the take out waiter will be with me in a minute, but then he directed his attention to another party.  Another couple minutes went by, until I asked about the order again.  He THEN went to find the waiter.  While he was on his search, i noticed the front phone was missing from the charger.  The receptionist came back with the waiter and I ordered.  The waiter left  and I asked the receptionist about the phone.  I told him, I tried calling for a long time and he said, ""oh yeah, the takeout dude has it.""  He told me it would be a 15 minute wait, so I waited outside.   10 minutes went by and a man walked in the restaurant, walked right up to the waiter, and processed the finalization of a takeout order.  When the customer walked out, I asked him how he ordered his food. He said he called but it took him 30 minutes to get through to anybody.   After sitting outside for 25 minutes, I gave up my wait and decided to see what had happened with my meals.  The receptionist then gathered the waiter who said ""Oh crap, your order!"" He brought me 2 bags of food and opened them up for me.  I noticed that not only did I have a side missing, but out of the 2 meals, both had a part of the main dish missing as well.  He apologized and ran to the back and got the rest of my food.  When we finalized my order with him, I asked him about the missing phone and his winning answer was ""Uh, I don't know who has it. I thought he (the receptionist) had it.""  Never again, will we return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=20,2.0,2.02,2.02,,2.012
