23,Mike E.,"Enfield, CT",117,15,2.0,2.0,2012-06-12,"I came here on a Friday night with a group of about five, towards the end of the dinner rush.  We were sat at a table by the door and the waitress picked up our drink order relatively quickly.  Three of the people in our dinner party had to try the chocolate Guinness milkshake, and while I only had a taste, it didn't have the Guinness flavor I was hoping for. After we got our drinks, the service was sub-par.  The food order wasn't taken for quite a while, but did come out relatively quickly once it was taken.  I got the Spicy Craft Beer-Cheese Burger, of which the waitress warned me was spicy, but even with both jalapeños AND fried jalapeños, I didn't even break a sweat.  It's a family establishment, so I understand them erring on the side of caution, but I was oh-so-hoping to need another beer. The major issue I had with the restaurant was after we got our food we weren't checked on.  Our waitress was sweeping up the tables around us for a good fifteen minutes after all of us were done.  I had to call her over to get our checks, and was left with the feeling that her getting her side-work done so she could leaver earlier was the priority.  We requested that the checks be split as well, which was done incorrectly (we were informed that this was automated) and half the group was left waiting while she went to fix it (she left no pen).  Again, the food wasn't bad, but it's typical chain restaurant fare.  I'm sure I'll be back for a quick and local dinner in the future and hopefully the service will be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-enfield-2?start=20,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003
25,Marie H.,"Enfield, CT",6,5,4.0,4.0,2012-07-20,"Always a good meal at Fridays.  Wait staff is great---attentive.  Tried the new Korean Steak Tacos, very tasty but VERY spicy.  The rice that is served with them is awesome!  Next time will stick to my tried and true favorites.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-enfield-2?start=20,,,,,
16,Ann E.,"Suffield, CT",32,383,248.0,3.0,2014-04-08,"Stopped in after work this afternoon with friends. There were 12 of us. Our server handled our needs effortlessly. We had a variety of things- some of us shared appetizers, others had meals. The food was average. The pretzels and the flatbreads were the best. My rum cocktail was just okay, so I switched to draft beer. We all enjoyed our visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-enfield-2,,,,,
22,Lina C.,"Queensbury, NY",0,17,,1.0,2014-08-03,"Came here with a party of five ... Drinks came after appetizers and our two peach sangrias had frozen fruit in them and tasted nothing like a peach sangria ... Food was ok we ordered nothing too complicated ... Our waitress took our orders and brought the food out ... She walked by a dozen of times and never checked in ... Service was bad ..all around Been back a couple of times and sat at the bar. They offer bar deals for food and drinks , much better experience than table service ( their servers need to go back to training ) ... If I go back will definitely sit at the bar again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-enfield-2?start=20,,,,,
20,Richard P.,"Swampscott, MA",9,4,,1.0,2014-11-10,Went to tgi today we sat at the bar the bartender had a bitch of a attitude she embarrassed my fiancé we paid for our food once that happened and left NEVER GO THERE !!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-enfield-2?start=20,,,,,
18,Reagan C.,"West Springfield, MA",1,2,,5.0,2015-02-27,I feel this place got a bad reputation. I have been here many different times and never had a bad meal or bad service. The food is always great especially the jack daniels ribs.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-enfield-2,,,,,
13,Rebecca L.,"Suffield, CT",0,2,,2.0,2015-07-24,"Let me start off by saying that I have never had a problem with TGIFriday's until last night. The food is great and when dining-in I have always had a pleasant experience.   However, last night was a significant others' birthday and we ordered take-out. The order was simply 5 orders with hardly any modifications other than no burger toppings and sweet potato fries. We were very hungry and anticipating a great dinner.  When returning home there were only 4 boxes of food, not the 5 that were ordered.  I proceeded to call TGIFriday's and state that I didn't receive my full order.  I was transferred the manager and she non-chalantly said ""do you still want your order"". My initial response was yes, I paid for it. I was very shocked at the lack of customer service.   A new burger was remade and I was able to pick it up within 10 minutes.  Once I arrived the manager wasn't even the one to present the mistaken order and apologize. Not only that but there was no discount or an offer to reimburse.  I was very disappointed with the lack of customer service especially from the acting manager who presented herself as uncaring.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-enfield-2,,,,,
21,Chester C.,"Amherst, MA",0,52,2.0,2.0,2016-01-01,"Really not that good, but is any TGIF ever that good? I don't know why I expected this one to be better. Salad dressing was gross, burger wasn't very good. The service was very friendly though which is why I give 2 stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-enfield-2?start=20,,,,,
24,Matt L.,"Boston, MA",0,3,,5.0,2016-01-08,"I have been going to this location on a regular basis for over a year and have always had a great time with the staff although we probably drive them crazy after a few brewskis! Beer selection is what you would expect from a chain but their mixed drinks are delicious and worth a try if that's your thing! Food is consistently good and I recommend joining the Give Me More Stripes reward program because you actually get free food without spending a fortune first and you get a free appetizer just for signing up! If it's your first time I highly recommend trying the Jack Daniels Burger because it is top notch and that's coming from a burger connoisseur. However, request to get the jack daniels sauce on the side so your bun does not get too soggy! The new Apps all around is a good value and allows you to choose from 3, 4 or 5 different items and you really can not go wrong with any of the available options! They have several screens to watch the games on but their placement is not the best but it is definitely workable if your neck is not in a brace. I would rather go here to watch a game and have a friendly relaxing atmosphere then go to Chicago Sams and have to deal with their unfriendly staff and overpriced sub par food. I feel some of the reviews on here are a bit too harsh and undeserved. In my opinion it is not fair to judge a restaurant either way after only one visit because every establishment has their good and bad nights. Maybe they were short staffed, maybe they were training someone new or maybe someone was human and actually made a mistake on your order! I have probably been to this location about 30 times in the last year and to the one by my house near Boston another 30 so I believe I am in a good position to properly rate this place! Also many people don't tate it taking into consideration the category of restaurant Friday's is in! Don't compare it to Capital Grill or L'Espalier because their is no comparison. Out of the comparable places; Applebees, Chilis, Ninety Nine, Ruby Tuesdays and Outback this place takes home the trophy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-enfield-2?start=20,,,,,
10,Jake H.,"West Warwick, RI",54,4,,1.0,2016-04-17,"The food was cold and overpriced in the way that all TGIFridays food is phenomenally overpriced.  My real gripe, though, is that they gave us a lunch menu at lunch time on a Sunday. Then, after we selected our food, they told us that the lunch menu was only available during the week.  The right way to handle this is to get is the food we ordered and let us know that they made a mistake and that in the future the lunch menu is only available during the week. The waitress, Courtney, barely managed to mumble an apology while she took our lunch menus away leaving us to select from the higher priced, dinner menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-enfield-2,,,,,
17,Tina E.,"Stratford, CT",0,1,,1.0,2016-04-19,"Terrible service.. Took forever for the drinks, food, and appetizers. There was like 2 or 3 tables occupied and ours.. The place was empty. The waitress was really fast to give us the bill though. I will never go back there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-enfield-2,,,,,
11,Lori B.,"Suffield, CT",4,191,3.0,2.0,2016-07-21,"This review is two stars only because our server was attentive and personable, she was great (I missed her name, blonde with tattoos in the bar - excellent server. Go work somewhere else and we will be regulars of yours in 2.5 seconds).   We started with the ""craft beer-cheese dipping sauce"" which tasted like some velvetta with bacon and is served with mediocre soft pretzels, potato skins which are somehow really mushy which I can't even comprehend (maybe frozen, thawed poorly and fried? - I can't grasp what happened here) and boneless chicken ""wings"" which are mostly breading though I will say I like the Jack sauce. None of it was hot. Also, not really enough for 4 people frankly. I had fried shrimp which was ok (though also not hot) because deep-fried is deep fried though the breading is super bland but I remedied that with a side of that Jack sauce (they don't have tartar and their cocktail sauce is obviously bottle and mega-bland). GF's steak was over-cooked and really, really overly black-peppered. I am not a fan of their fries even, they were just blah for seasoned fries. The key lime shooters are gross, overly sugary and  lacking in booze. Typical friday's experience. Just meh. I was fed, that's about it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-enfield-2,,,,,
12,Key R.,"Windsor, CT",37,12,1.0,5.0,2016-07-22,Never have had bad service here. The staff is wonderful especially in the bar. Our server today was Michael and he was lovely and attentive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-enfield-2,,,,,
3,Jessica L.,"Farmington, CT",72,125,63.0,3.0,2016-07-24,"This location is part of a different franchise than the Manchester and Newington locations, so there are a few differences.  Notably, the limited happy hour specials run Sunday - Thursday and are in the bar only.  They offer only a few $5 apps and various prices on drinks. Everyone most likely already has an opinion about Friday's as an American fare chain. If you have never been here before though, try anything with the Jack Daniels sauce. So yum. Service was good and the restaurant was clean. The food was served warm; not piping hot and fresh, but also not uncomfortably cool.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-enfield-2,,,,,
15,Dom W.,"Enfield, CT",101,2,,1.0,2016-09-18,"I won't go back to this place ever. Went at a time it wasn't busy at all, ordered two alcoholic drinks and some food. about 25 minutes went by with no drinks, I asked and finally ONE of the two drinks arrive and they say other one is being made... now our food shows up and my drink is still not there. I go up to the bar to see what's up, the bar isn't full and there were two bartenders. when I asked the girl bartender, she was so rude in response ""I'm making it now"" with a tone that just gets your blood boiling. I'm one to tip good and give anyone the benefit of the doubt , but this was truly unacceptable. And for them to not apologize or anything shows how shit of a business they have there. 11 dollar drinks is also a joke when they aren't even a full glass. No one in that building was friendly except for the hostess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-enfield-2,,,,,
1,Nina C.,"Enfield, CT",69,44,201.0,5.0,2016-09-24,"Good food, good atmosphere, good service, and I love their rewards program! Hubby and I went out w/ a large group of friends. I ordered the Jack Daniels Rib Eye and Shrimp with a side of mashed potatoes, and mac n cheese. DH ordered similar but without the Jack Daniels sauce.  We ended up getting 122 points back after our meal, I was able to take our youngest son out for lunch the following week, and my meal (sizzling chicken and shrimp) was FREE! Nothing to complain about! I'm loving T.G.I Friday's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-enfield-2,,,,,
9,Joshua D.,"Sunderland, MA",13,38,2.0,2.0,2016-10-03,"Food was pretty much just ""ok"". It wasn't very good. Most of the drinks on the drink menu did not have a price, which should have tipped me off that they were much more expensive than they should have been. I had a Sangria as my drink and a ""Pick 3"" appetizer meal with Ghost Chili sauce: my first two disappointments of the night. The Sangria was highly overpriced (over $10 for a single glass) and the ghost chili sauce was weak. I've had much spicier sauces at other restaurants, so calling it ""Ghost Chili"" is insulting to the chili there and is a shameless advertising trick. My entree was no better. The piece of fish in my wrap was tiny. Not even a full portion worth in my opinion.  Pros: - Food was ok.  - Drink tasted good. Cons: - Barely any ""drink"" in the drink. It was about five or six sips in the entire glass. - Food was highly overpriced for the quality.  - Wings were pretty poor quality and small.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-enfield-2,,,,,
14,Phill K.,"Hartford, CT",0,14,,5.0,2016-12-04,Make this the regular watering hole for a reason! Friendly and efficient bar staff. Attentive and courteous. Recommend the rewards program if you go there often. Free chips and easy to gain rewards for $ spent. Only criticism is the the trivia DJ is very annoying on trivia night when you're on the bar side!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-enfield-2,,,,,
6,Marz R.,"Springfield, MA",62,26,3.0,2.0,2016-12-08,"My friend and I walk in and it looked like they were having some kind of trivia night at the bar. We sat in the dining area. It was very loud, but my friend and I made due and dealt with the noise. We could still hear each other talk so no biggie.  Our waitress was nice, but she seemed to be lagging; as if she was just ready to leave and maybe had enough of the day. My friend ordered water and I a drink. It took about 10 minutes for our drinks. Then a large party came in of about 10 people and this really screwed with our service. The majority of the time spent at the restaurant was waiting. We had another person bring us our appetizer, another person bring us our food, and the waitress never came back at all to check on us. I had to sip loudly for someone to even acknowledge I needed a refill.  It seems she may have been overwhelmed by having a bigger party to cater to and forgot about us. I said that to my friend but she said ""well we aren't on payroll that has nothing to do with us, stop trying to always make excuses for these poor dining experiences. You are the customer, you are paying for a service, and we're barely getting that service. She was upset and didn't even want to eat, she wrapped her food in a box and took it to go.  The food was ok, nothing out of this world.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-enfield-2,,,,,
4,Benjamin H.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,25,1.0,3.0,2017-04-02,"We came In on a Friday night and were seated promptly.

She was very friendly, prompt with refilling our drinks, and my husband's endless apps refills. Everyone was very happy with theur food.

8,Robert T.,"Agawam, MA",0,5,,1.0,2017-06-15,"When we arrived, we noticed a beer can next to the front door and petunias growing in the parking lot cracks in front of the only entrance. This should have been a sign.   The hostess gave us attitude when we asked to be seated in the restaurant instead of the bar.  (Note there were some other people in the restaurant area.)  The menu had lots of pages filled with drinks and appetizers, but only one page of entrees.  The chips and salsa was a single portion (for two).  They no longer have their wedge salad.  The service was excellent but it did not make up for the losses from the menu.  If you are watching your salt intake or  looking for dinner, this is not the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-enfield-2,,,,,

7,Janette M.,"Wenonah, NJ",0,1,,1.0,2017-10-15,Never again will I go back to this TGI Friday's! Or any given location that has to do anything with them. I waited a very long time for my food on top of that all when I finally received it my fries were literally frozen the waiter couldn't juggle 3 tables!! Out of this world!! I basically got kicked out because my 2yr old son was acting 2. I was told he was disturbing the other customers! Like really? Am I really chopped liver here! I'm paying for my food as well.

2,Corrine B.,"Enfield, CT",2,25,23.0,2.0,2017-10-28,"Four of us came in for dinner at 5:30 on a Saturday (our play down the road started at 7), and the place was starting to get busy. However, we got seated quickly at a tall table near the bar. The server was fantastic--personable and able to answer our questions regarding the menu. I ordered the Caesar salad and the Brussels sprouts dish. Not super exciting, I know, but I don't eat meat and didn't feel up to eating a bean burger. The salad was...a typical Caesar salad. The Brussels sprouts dish was under-cooked. My dinner-mates all ordered meat dishes and while nobody thought the food was bad...it was completely unremarkable. Hence the ""meh.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-enfield-2,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
