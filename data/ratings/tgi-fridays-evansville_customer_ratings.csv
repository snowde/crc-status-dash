10,P K.,"Dania Beach, FL",0,18,,2.0,2013-04-17,If you're doing takeout don't forget to check your order BEFORE you leave!  I specified...3 times during the course of the order....that I wanted Sweet Potato Fries with my Turkey Burger...the bartender (who took the order) even checked it himself before I walked out with it to make sure my mayo was in there and when I went to eat it...guess what...regular french fries!   HELLO  Sweet Potatoes are a different color from white potatoes!!  I should have gone to my 1st choice Olive Garden instead....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-evansville,,,,,
5,Chris M.,"Owensboro, KY",2,23,8.0,2.0,2014-02-16,"Half empty restaurant and 10 minutes for drinks (beer) to which the server said the bartender was still making it, then another five for them to figure out they don't have rib eyes. Noticed they were having to comp tables next to us and it's easy to tell why. More to follow I'm sure. New table beside us and plates are going back. And the table behind us are having issues. This restaurant has a failure of service and management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-evansville,,,,,
7,Eric H.,"Evansville, IN",13,11,,1.0,2014-10-31,"I go here enough that the bartenders and a manager know my name, the bar staff is pretty awesome but, if you order food expect for them to be out of something that you order or it to be wrong the Kitchen Manager obviously doesn't have a handle on his kitchen. There is a very pronounced lack of communication between the BOH and FOH.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-evansville,,,,,
8,Mike J.,"Evansville, IN",42,18,,4.0,2015-01-04,"Ate at Fridays today and had excellent service. We did the all you can eat appetizers for ten bucks each. Great food, small issue with the check but the manager on duty addressed it and we will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-evansville,,,,,
3,J.T. C.,"Evansville, IN",0,7,,2.0,2015-08-05,"The location may explain problems with this restaurant. It is located in the only ""mall"" within 50 miles and the biggest mall within 100 miles. Given that, they have a continuous flow of customers, regardless of service & they can charge 30-35% more than surrounding restaurants. My wife works Wednesday's so I bring food home every Wednesday night and have done so for the past 10 years. I have been to every restaurant in the area. TGIF, on average, is higher than Red Lobster. I have only tried TGIF twice in the last few years - because they are in the mall. Both times, the order was wrong. The first time something was left out. I don't remember the details but I remember calling. They offered for me to return to get what was missing but I live 15 minutes away and wasn't planning on a 30 minute round trip. They sent coupons to make up for it. I never used them. This time (tonight) I ordered the Strawberry salad.  They may want to have their chefs read the menu. The menu states the salad comes with ""Fresh balsamic-marinated strawberries, shaved Parmesan, goat cheese and glazed pecans served over mixed greens tossed with Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing."" My salad actually came with: fresh basamic-marinated strawberries, served over Romain lettuce tossed with Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing. NO PARMESEAN CHEESE, GOAT CHEESE OR GLAZED PECANS.  In their defense, it would have been a damn good salad had it come with everything advertized.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-evansville,,,,,
2,Samuel B.,"Newburgh, IN",5,16,4.0,1.0,2015-09-24,"My Wife and I decided to take a health walk at Eastland mall. After we got done we decided to get what we expected would be a good meal at T.G.I. Friday's. What we got was a comedy of errors. First off we were seated in what was a mostly empty dining room and in spite of that fact, it took about 10 minutes for a server to acknowledge our existence.    We ordered our drinks and food. (a French dip for my wife, and a Jack daniels ribeye steak and fried shrimp for myself with a side salad.) The problems started when the food came. I ordered my steak rare as is my custom, what I got was medium. I sent it back and told my wife to start her meal as I didn't mind her eating while I wait. She took one bite of her french dip and described it as refrigerator cold.  my wife also noticed that they had never brought my salad that should have come before my entree. This was all to much for my wife she rejected the idea of having them remake her entree and simply wanted to leave.  We called for the manager who was very apologetic and comped our entire meal. I decided to take the steak that was being remade for me. I looked in the bag and guess what, they once again had forgotten to include the salad. with the order finally complete, we left for home. when I did finally sit down to eat my meal after all that trouble... my steak still wasn't cooked right. The only kudos I can offer is that the manager did comp our meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-evansville,,,,,
6,Tammi B.,"Owensboro, KY",128,6,,1.0,2015-09-24,"This dining experience was tragic. Nobody was in there and it took 10 minutes for the server to initially come to the table. My husband's steak was medium instead of rare so we sent it back. That's when we noticed he never got his salad. Then, the server said she meant to tell us they didn't have oil and vinegar dressing. My au jus sandwich was refigerator cold. Then, the manager offered to comp everything. I just wanted to leave and refused another sandwich. My husband went ahead and accepted the steak replacement that was already being prepared. On the way out, they forgot his salad AGAIN so the we had to wait until they made one before we could leave. WE WON'T BE BACK!!! Pathetic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-evansville,,,,,
9,Dave S.,"Huntingburg, IN",1,17,,2.0,2015-11-30,"This place is more of a ""food court"" style of restaurant, being located in a busy mall, and presumably catering to the mall crowd. It is understandable that you're not likely to get a steak of the same quality as that which would be served in an actual steak house. The steak I was served here during my first visit was too tough to be cut with conventional dining utensils, and I ended up leaving most of it on the plate. That was back several years ago when they initially opened. I recently returned, only for the second time, basically because that's where the rest of the group wanted to go. This time, being more mindful of the fact that they weren't set up for steaks, I ordered diner fare, settling for a burger of sorts, with a bourbon style sauce. I am pleased to report that this burger was quite good, as were the sides. The waiter did manage to get the orders wrong for several of those in the group however, which put a damper on the experience. That being said, the prices are out of line for the quality, and they appear to be depending on hyped-up T.V. advertising to carry them. As long as you're expectations are not too high, and you realize that it is actually just a diner, you'll do OK here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-evansville,,,,,
4,Shanna B.,"Owensboro, KY",0,17,4.0,3.0,2016-07-17,"Enjoyed the Mahi Mahi grilled, rice and broccoli. Nice and light for an early dinner. Not as clean of a restaurant as I would normally.
