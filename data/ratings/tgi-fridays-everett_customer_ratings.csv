83,Daniela L.,"Somerville, MA",1,30,1.0,1.0,2012-05-23,"Very disappointed. I went there to give it a try. I did not want to have a full meal, wanted something lighter or smaller because it was past 9 pm. My options then would be combining two of these: soup, salad, sandwich. I was worried that the soup would most likely have MSG and not made from scratch, if not canned soup. So, I opted for a salad with sandwich (forgot the name). The waitress could not understand English well and asked if I would like less blue cheese on the salad and I said not, that I wanted everything I was entitled to have in this order. The salad was basically a quarter of a small lettuce cut as a whole piece with three table spoons of dressing on it. Quite frankly, I could barely see any blue cheese, imagine if there would be less blue cheese than usual. The sandwich had one slice of tomato, white bread (not even a single seed or whole wheat), two thin slices of cheese, one leaf of lettuce and some ham, not smoked, not honey-mustard, just ordinary ham. I can definitely eat way better at home. My husband ordered chicken with rice and it was greasy and you could easily see the oil at the bottom. At the end, the waitress brought us a container to go and a plastic bag and left it on the table. The sandwich is still standing in the fridge and I suspect is going to remain there. No, thanks, not again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett?start=100,2.72,2.72,2.72,1.924,2.72

62,Phillip K.,"Everett, MA",0,13,,3.0,2012-06-19,"So the  choice was between Cheesecake factory and this place. We settled for this. We had been there once and I thought it was pretty nice.  First, the food is not that much. I ordered a steak and it was over cooked and dry as in DRY. I am no Master Chef but I don't think it's supposed to be that dry.  The waitress did her job to the best of her ability. So I won't complain so much (besides she was cute, they all are..mostly). But they looked under powered. It looked like they did not have enough waitresses to suffice the customer load or they were newbies. Either way she kept making mistakes almost like she was in two worlds.  The environment is great. I wouldn't complain.  I only need some increase in their meal portions. This I say because at cheesecake factory you get more than what u can eat (depends on your appetite) but for a little more money with some nice service. And they are equally as busy as this place.  I love their mango like slushy lemonade thingie. (Forget what it's called) but its delish plus it comes with free refills.

Her craving for those abominations of our last visit (Sesame Jack Chicken Strips) had us swinging by begrudgingly, and hoping for better fare. Better? Hardly. Fare? Outlook not so good. The new pretzel twists with craft beer cheese dips are base-drenched sponges that suck up oily cheese melt and the rest of your appetite. Guess we should have listened when the server's reply to ""Are they good?"" is ""A lot of people don' like them."" Thanks, salesman. Had the pleasure to battle through my equally soft and soggy burger, slathered with the same abysmal cheese dip as those hellish pretzel dough, a few fried-til-mushy jalapeños and pickled ones. Craft nothing; crap everything. Sadly, this won't be my last venture to do eat at a Fridays. She loves the Sesame Jack too much and I love her on the same level.

I prefer my restaurants totally roach-free.

(note that this was a random tuesday night at 9pm.. the restaurant was more than empty so i dont know where the host was or what she was doing but it was not busy at all) we ordered our apps and food which went well; however...  i ordered the chicken caesar salad. (the balsamic chicken i think its called on the menu) and i order a salad at EVERY SINGLE place i go to. no matter what. i love salad. i eat at least 3 a day. i love love love them. ANYWAYS... this salad was THE SINGLE MOST DISGUSTING THING I HAVE EVER TASTED IN MY LIFE. i have ordered salads before at other places, and may have not liked them, but i always forced myself to eat it because i am not one to waste food and also because i do not complain to waiters and/or send food back. i just dont do that, thats not me. but anyways.. i physically could not eat this salad. the lettice and toppings were fine.. but the DRESSING.. omg it was HORRIBLE! and waaay too much of it and idk what the taste was, but it was GROSS and i even put salt and pepper to help spice it up a bit but it did not work. i had about 4 or 5 bites and i was done. my bf even said to me ""YOU are not going to finish your salad?!"" because i honestly cannot remember a single salad where i have left anything left on my plate. honestly im like a rabbit.. i eat EVERYTHING off the plate no matter the salad. so this was a big deal when i couldnt eat it. it was too gross.  we will never be back to any tgi fridays ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett?start=80,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.148,2.44

We chose: Potato skins, pot stickers and the Garlic Parmesan boneless chicken. -The potato skins were DRY IS HELL! -The dumplings were pork so I didn't try them but my date said they were good. And the GARLIC CHiCKEN is one of the main reason why I would come again. Pros: -I ordered the alcohol mango lemonade and it was STRONG! oohwee... -For my entree, I ordered the grilled Salmon with mixed veggies and Jasmine rice. It was REALLY good! The only reason I am giving this location 2 stars instead of three is because the potato skins were SO DAMN DRY (no exaggeration). Possibly because I ordered them with no bacon?

After waiting for 35 minutes, the waiter comes over with about 25 chips on a plate to tide us over until our app gets here. Who are you kidding - it's not like you're growing spinach and harvesting artichokes for my dip - you're microwaving that crap in a bowl. It should take all of 2 minutes to get me my dip!  4. After 45 minutes, my dip comes. It's nothing special, but what did I expect?!  5. 3 minutes later, the rest of the food is put on the table. The 3 kids with us are passed out in the booth from starvation and have started eating the crayons they got with their menus. I didn't realize that chicken fingers took over 45 minutes to make - WTH.  6. My food was cold. After ALL of this, the food was cold.

We had a very friendly waitress. We got the 3 for $15 - Mac n' cheese bites, beef skewers and pork tacos. The Mac n' cheese bites were off the hook - the cheese sauce was very filling and it was a bit on the salty side, but nonetheless, delicious. The beef skewers came with a pita bread and cooked probably medium well; very juicy and tender. The pork tacos had a hint of spicy and I felt it was a bit juicy perhaps due to the cole slaw on top?

The dressing was dripping off my lettuce there was so much of it. When the bill came, my salad was $11 and said chicken Caesar salad. I pointed out to him that my salad was literally lettuce and tomatoes and it wasn't even what I wanted and he said there was no side salad price and there wasn't a price without chicken.

Okay fine, they refired our food and we sat hungrily awaiting it. Second try came out and the burger is overdone again (whatever, I ate it) but they forgot cheese in the quesadilla AGAIN. How is that possible, cheese is basically the foundation for a quesadilla!! There were 2 ingredients: chicken and cheese, and they forgot 50% of them...twice. They sent the manager over who offered to take items off of our bill but she was not at all professional or reassuring about the situation.

14,Sasha M.,"Somerville, MA",149,141,219.0,1.0,2017-05-28,"I will never ever go back here again. My boyfriend and I came in for an early dinner (around 4pm) and right when we walked in there were 3 workers at the hostess stand. I think 2 were servers and 1 was the host. Didn't greet us with a smile...just kinda stood there with blank looks on their faces....I went up to them asking for a table for 2 and they blankly looked at each other and back at me for a while before one of the guys was like, ""i guess I should clean a table"" and walked off....and the girl was like ""It'll b a few minutes"" with NO sympathy no niceness in her voice at all. ALREADY that annoyed me....if you are at the host station, you are the first point of contact that patrons get. Why are you going to be so rude to people? It was like they hated their job and didn't care who knows it. Ok....Decided against leaving because maybe the food will be ok since I was very hungry. Was seated....our server seemed nice, but she definitely was super slow even though it looked like a full house of servers and not many tables seated.....It took us nearly 15-20 min to even get our drinks....and when we ordered food, my boyfriend's food came out fine....Mine however was ALL wrong. I specified that I would want my rib eye MEDIUM RARE. I made sure to say it slowly and loudly so she understood. My steak came out WELL DONE. It's funny when the steak is overcooked yet my mashed potatoes were only warm....how in the world??? So i had to let her know they cooked it wrong....and she said she will bring out another one. Mind you, the whole time this was happening, another table had been seated, given drinks, food, and their server checked in on them a few times. The manager came over to apologize for the steak....he was very nice and seemed very sorry. I let him know about my other thoughts upon first arrival, and he said he will talk to them. I hope he did, they definitely seemed like they don't care for authority figures at all.  Anyway, my next steak came out....I cut into it, it was pink...more Medium than Medium rare, but definitely an improvement. I was really hungry by this point so I just ate the part that seemed medium rare....So at this point, my boyfriend's food has been long gone so he's just watching me eat at this point. Our waitress seemed like she was confused most of the time, and seriously, there was NO crowd.....there were more servers than tables filled.  Overall, everything was terrible except the fact that the manger came over to apologize. That was it. I will never go back to this location. I used to work in the service industry for years and the level of service and how unprofessional everyone was....appalling. There was a spot in the front of house that all the servers would just hang around....shouldn't it be in the back of house so all the patrons don't see congregations happening.  I've had plenty of good experiences at Friday's...this is by far the ONLY and WORST one ever. I will not give it a second chance. This is it, folks.

At first I thought it was great that they finally implemented online reservations, which put me ahead of everyone else waiting but once I was seated, it all took a turn for the worse. Not only did the restaurant have a musty smell to it, it was also visibly dirty. The floors looked like they hadn't been swept or wiped in a while...and don't get me started on the bathroom. To top it off, after unraveling my utensils, I immediately noticed the knife was dirty and had remnants of someone else's food crusted on it. Thankfully, I didn't need to use it but it totally took away my appetite and from that point I didn't trust any of the other dishes sitting in front of me.

I don't nitpick at all and I probably let 99% of things go because I also work as a server and know how tough it can be but our service was the worst I've ever had.  We ordered drinks and a combo app plate and just wanted to work on that for a while and eventually put in entrees and food to bring home. Once the apps came and she asked if we wanted to put in more food. We said we would work on that for now and put it more stuff later. That was it and she never came back. She didn't check on us not one time more. She eventually came over after we had been done and we're sitting there looking around. We just ordered dessert at this point because it was getting late and it was taking so long. She took our order and immediately brought over the check. We hadn't even gotten the dessert yet. So now we weren't getting food to take home. She never cleared any of our plates for us and the high top tables are small enough. She only came back to ask if we were done with the check. I gave her the gift card and that was it. She dropped it back off. No thank you, have a good night, absolutely nothing.

They forgot our food on FOUR different occasions. FOUR! And it wasn't the server it was the kitchen. When my nachos come th only thing that was on them was jalapeños. No salsa, no cheese no queso, no nothing! I walked up to hand it back to the manager and he rolled his eyes took my plate and said we'll just make another one.   THEN he sent the server to the table to tell us we were ""86d nachos"" because they ran out of cheese. Oh, so the kitchen felt it was appropriate to just bypass communication and send me out Tostitos chips with jalapeños and expect me not to realize? Funny. Eddie was our server and he was so on top of everything. He tried so hard and would run to our table every couple minutes asking us ""did you get this, have you gotten that, is everyone good on drinks"".

Me and my girlfriend went here for some lunch on a slow day and BOY was this the worst experience I've had here (and I've come here a lot over the years). Our waitress was Gianna and she was the worst waitress I have EVER had....I waited 10 minutes for a coke along with my girlfriend who waited the same. We sat 20 minutes for a quesadilla that I can HONESTLY say she didn't even put in along with my girlfriends food as well due to her talking so damn much to her friends that were sitting behind us. I understand if you're pretty excited to see your friends or friends friends that come in and you've been acquainted before ? But you have a job to do. Gianna didn't bother telling us she didn't even put our orders in or anything (mind you she only had 3 tables as well) she just kept walking by us and having her conversation with the table next to us. We sat and watched all the other tables getting their food while she just kept talking her friends ear off.  I finally got my one appetizer after 20 minutes with my drink just full of watered down coke sitting at the bottom of my cup waiting to get a refill, then 5-10 minutes later my girlfriend finally got the words ""so you're sandwich is being plated now and should be out shortly""......didn't know it took 25 minutes to prep a chicken sandwich on a slow lunch time ?

It brought me back to my first and last experience there and although that was 6 years ago I am finally ready to shed some light on my experience.  We sat down on a Saturday afternoon and we were greeted by our waitress. I don't remember her name. We've been calling her Julie for the last six years but I'm not sure if that's her real name. Anyways, we sit down and it's pretty full in there. No wait, but still you're average busy Saturday afternoon at a chain restaurant. We sit down and she brings us over waters and then leaves for about 15 minutes.  We don't have any silverware on our table. Just waters and plates and some napkins. She comes over after the 15 minutes of disappearance. She asks us what we want for an appetizer. We order some fried string bean thing that was just blah. Not only was it blah it took about 25 minutes to come out. Like... you're frying string beans? What does that take 5 mins and I'm sure it's a popular dish so I'm sure they make it in bulk. Anyways, moving on.  We order our meals which consisted of a burger, potato skins, and one of the salads with chicken on it. Easy and quick enough, right? Wrong. Our meals took over 45 minutes to come out. Like Fridays I'm sorry but are you kidding me the potato skins come from the freezer for petes sake.  Waitress delivers our food and doesn't give us utensils for about 5 minutes and when she does come back with the utensils my friend asks for the sour cream that was supposed to come with his potato skins... she brings it over 20 minutes later after he's just about finished eating and she throws her hands up in defeat and says ""I'm sorry I just got so busy I didn't know what to do"" ......... it really wasn't even that busy. Like this girl just disintegrating into thin air every ten mins and we wouldn't see her for long periods of time. Who the heck knows what she was up to.  So all in all I spent a whopping 2.5 hours at Fridays on this lovely Saturday afternoon. In fact, the table next to us had two parties seated and finished in the time we spent there. I'd like to thank you Julie for making a lasting impression of TGI Fridays in my brain for years to come. Hands down worst service I've ever had at any restaurant ever. Years later we can't even help but laugh.

We also asked if he could turn the music down.  He said no problem but didn't turn it down.  had to ask again later. Drinks came quick.  We asked for chips and salsa (we were also using one of the coupons they send us every 3 months) Husband wasn't very hungry but ordered something to go and I ordered a salad.  That was at 7:10 and we'd already been there a good 15 minutes.  Again, a SLOW night.  At about 7:25, we asked about the chips and salsa we never got and he said ""they should be out shortly""!  Wow.  they came a few minutes later.  So now we're still waiting for our food and it's 7:45.  Finally I said to the bartender ""please also make mine to go"".  A few minutes later at 7:50, out comes the food and of course mine isn't to go so I very nicely told the young lady delivering the food that I had requested it to go.  She got very nasty and said ""Well I didn't know that""!  Then as she was walking away she turned around and gave me such a dirty look and disappeared with my food.  If looks could kill, I'd be dead.  I was honestly afraid she'd spit in it.  Next thing you know the ""manager"" comes out and asks us was it because of the long wait for the food that we wanted it to go and we said yes.  We also reported the nasty person that delivered our food.  She basically says ""sorry about that"" and leaves.  Then I have to flag down the bartender AGAIN to pay.  he has no clue what to do with my coupon and continues to take orders from people.  then he picks up my credit card that he left on the register and disappears to talk to the manager I guess.  Comes back several minutes later finally with the bill.  Based on the reviews I'm reading here, slow service seems to be a trademark of this particular TGIF.  They need new management ASAP.  What started out as a quick trip to get a bite to eat and a drink turned into a fiasco.  To make matters worse, when I opened the salad when I got home, it looked like garbage.  It was like that nasty person poured salad dressing all over it and squished it down.  It was inedible and  I was honestly afraid to eat anyway it so I threw it out.  The manager here needs to be fired and they need to hire competent customer service driven people.  I honestly hope the owner reads this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett?start=20,1.6,2.26,2.26,,1.996

Everything was delayed, even things that shouldn't be, like glasses of water and our chips & salsa. We sat for over 45 minutes with no drinks and no food. When the food finally did arrive, it was overwhelmingly sub par. Mashed potatoes were lukewarm and crusty, steak wasn't evenly cooked, portions were small, parts of dishes were missing completely. We received a coupon for a free appetizer or dessert but it doesn't really matter because I wouldn't go back, at least to that location. It would have been a nice touch to have at least a couple of the dishes comped. I ordered a Manhattan, which was good but if I'm splitting hairs, it lacked a garnish. A cherry would have been appreciated. I also ordered a southern chicken sandwich which was very small and lacking the avocado and sauce.

I added on 6 crispy shrimp for 4$.  They were horribly over cooked, rubbery and also room temperature.   The French dip sandwich was described ad ""decent"" but i didn't try any. It was served warm tho.  The fries were also just ok and not hot. Our server, Mike, was really good, pleasant and attentive. He kept the meal from being a complete disaster.   3 stars ALL go to Mike.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett,1.64,2.18,2.18,,1.964
2,Becky B.,"Marshfield, MA",75,196,118.0,2.0,2017-12-17,"We come here on a fairly regular basis. Usually, the food and service are ok. Today, however, the food and service were what I would consider poor. We were one of the first customers, so it wasn't busy yet.  Our appetizer took a long time to come out. Then my husband and I got our meals before our friend. We ate at least half our meals before his food came out. My quesadillas were soggy and burnt.  The manager brought out our friend's meal and sincerely apologized for the poor experience. He said he would adjust our bill. A few minutes later, they brought our more of our friend's meal they had forgotten!!  We will probably come back but hopefully next time is better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett,1.64,2.16,2.16,,1.952
17,Yarilis G.,"Boston, MA",40,3,1.0,1.0,2017-12-17,"I went this past weekend and had a horrible experience; i went with three of my girlfriends, waiter was sweet  but the drinks alone took about 45min to get to the table. Then the food came about 45 min after that, when the food came the burger was burnt, our chicken daniels was ridiculously hard, the meat would move with the plate . it was just all around a bad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett,1.48,2.15,2.15,,1.882
1,Saachi F.,"Revere, MA",0,24,8.0,1.0,2017-12-18,"This was a regular spot for us since it was a decently priced chain restaurant in the area. But our last visit put us off here for a very long time. I ordered the quesadilla with just chicken and cheese. Not only did they get the order wrong, but they got it wrong twice. It was the same mistake twice and a really ridiculous mistake at that. There was no cheese. Literally, cheese is in the name of the dish.  I was so disappointed and didn't even bother to ask for them to correct it yet again. During the same meal, my husband's burger was so rare, the middle was cold to the touch. When he asked them to fix it, it came back well-done. I doubt we will ever go back, unless something we really LOVED comes back on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett,1.48,2.14,2.14,,1.876
