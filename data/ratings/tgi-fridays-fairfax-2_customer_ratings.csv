I hadn't been to a TGIF in quite a few months so I was anxious to check out the new ""less cheese"" I heard advertised on the radio. Well the cheese is gone but the staff at this particular restaurant needs a lot more training. When we first walk-in there is no hostess waiting at the front as I use to remember and no one came while we looked back and forth unsure of how to proceed.  We gave a shrug and decided to just head for the bar, usually better service anyways.... or so I thought. Sat down at one of the bar booths and the waitress is dull and not engaging at all. She tells us the specials and we order drinks and then some food. The drinks were rather quick but the waitress disappeared.... we finished our drinks and she still hadn't checked up on us, so we kept kind of looking around the small bar and she was no where to be seen. Luckily there was another waitress working some of the other tables and she brought us some waters. When our waitress finally shows up again its with our food and its barely lukewarm! Disappointment all around cause I love the fries here! UGH! We could tell she had let it sit and we were an after thought. She then promptly disappeared again (all the while we are watching the other red-headed waitress bustling around the bar) and we have to practically run her down to ask for a check to leave.

63,Victoria L.,"Herndon, VA",491,536,912.0,1.0,2013-11-05,"2 words- SH*T HOLE. It's my fault for stepping foot back in here because my little sister wanted to come but I should have said no. Whoever the manager is, NEEDS to go to McDonalds cleaning the floors, they must not give a flying wooha about their employees. They must have did a blind test and said whoever counts to 3 can get the job. Employees do not get trained whatsoever and you can tell. Let me tell you what happened on this ungrateful Tuesday (11/5/13) at 4pm.  I called this location around 3:45 to ask what happy hour specials they had and the lady said, ""We have half off appetizers at the bar"". I thought great saving me some money. So my sister and I get here at 4pm and walk straight to the bar area. Our bartender acknowledged us because we definitely made eye contact and there were about 10 people there so its not like he couldn't see us. We didn't even see the hostess until 5 minutes later so if we wanted to sit in the dining rooms we would have waited. So we sit there and hes giving people drinks whatever and 5 minutes pass by. I'm thinking you can't even come to get our drinks? I see the hostess and ask, ""Are the half price apps  only in the bar area?"" She said no they apply to the whole restaurant. I told great because the bartender is taking a very long time.  She sits us down in the dining room and theres about 2 other tables in the whole place thats being served to. She said sorry for the wait and I asked which apps are excluded from the half off appetizers? She said, I'm not sure but they should be $3 each ask your waiter. I said sure. I thought finally some damn service. Nope, waiters walk by and we don't get service for another 3-4 minutes. Some tall caucasian guy who looks homeless because he started no shave november a couple months ago comes to our table. So I asked him what apps are excluded? He tells me that's not our special tonight its the Jack Daniel's specials, and ""oh...but the bar has half price apps"". I told him I just freakin moved from there and the host told me its half price everywhere. He tells me with a f*kin smirk on his face and a shrug ""I'm sorry?!?!?!...but let me get your drinks"" I said no I'm leaving. What a douche. I look at the host as I'm leaving and she says ""you want to sit at the bar now?"" No bitch I don't want anything to do with you. Who hired her?!?! At least carry a damn cheat sheet if you don't know your stuff. So you're telling me I just wasted 15 minutes of my life sitting with a menu in front of me?! Goodness gracious. They act like its a crowded restaurant. I hope they get no customers and are forced to shut down.  I really would love for new management to take over at this location. I mean you can't expect the best service here but at least pretend to like people. I can't even tell you how bad I hate this place. It's a great place for people to kill time and have a drink. But for food and service you can just forget about it. I give this place negative stars. Actually they don't even deserve stars, they deserve the scum under my shoes.

Dave was our server and even though my friends are a pain in the butt sometimes, Dave was always nice and efficient. the food came out hot and it tasted very yummy. everything came out perfect as my friends and i celebrated our pre-thanksgiving get together (i know, not the best place to have a thanksgiving dinner, but we are not so picky). TIPS: if u want the specials sit at the bar. they are all good. try the mango lemonade shaker for a refreshing fruity drink. the wings are sometimes good and sometimes not so good.

We walk in to the bar, and sit down waiting for a server to approach. Two servers standing less than two feet from us, continually talk and laugh with each other, all the meanwhile ignoring us. I make eye contact with one of them (at this point my entire body is swiveled towards them... Hoping body language works better..) and again they completely ignore us. Finally, I walk up to them and ask them if they are closed. The guy rudely snaps ""No. We close at 1:30"" I look at them confused and ask, ""OK, should I order at the bar or somewhere else?"" The girl FINALLY UNDERSTANDS my not so subtle hint at doing her job and asks for my order.. We get our waters rather quickly, and so we think that perhaps it was just a misunderstanding. WELL... No. We wait about 20 minutes without one person asking us if we've been taken care of or checking on our order.. (I actually tried to walk up to another server but they also walked away)...I mean how long does it take to warm up a brownie and to scoop ice cream?? Finally we just get up and leave the restaurant at 12:50 without our order... And expectedly no one notices again. Needless to say, it was extremely disappointing and absolutely rude.

18,LanChi N.,"Fairfax, VA",224,396,1586.0,3.0,2014-12-26,Fridays... your typical chain restaurant... however its been awhile since I've visited...So long that my stripes rewards expired...So They have revamped their look removing the cheese and upscaling to a modern twist. How did they do... well lets see... I was on a date... we decided to sit at the bar near the TV's. I dono why but the curved seats just seemed awkward to me I mean it did help when watching the TV's but still its just strange.  Anyway...So I opened the menu trying to find the 1/2 off appetizers well  of course  my menu happened to be missing the appetizer page... and lucky for us we asked our waitress about it. She then had to bring me a new menu. Oh and she did mention some of their happy hour specials... however she could've just told us its also listed on their specials menu which also happened to have the beers discounted and the  selection of half off appetizers. Instead she waited until we placed our order  to tell us that unfortunately the ones we choice were not half off only one was. At that rate we just decided that we would order 1 more appetizer to match the 3 for $15 or whatever it was. Appetizers ordered...  the usual spinach  artichoke dip... salty like usual... but it does have the big chunks of artichoke.(oh this was half off lol).   The ahi tuna crisp... basically a fried corn tortilla with a small slice of tuna topped with guacamole... rather prefer it be a plantain chip but hey its Fridays... not a  5 star quality joint. Less then mediocre... Rueben sliders... probably would've tasted good if we didn't wait to eat it last.... however it as just meh... needed an extra side of mustard... and more corned beef. the steak skewers... were kinda chewy... the slaw was good tho. And the pita point was okay. Overall.... its a decent place with variety. Pricey without discounts  but if you go for happy hour its usually pretty worth it. Just remember to order the half price items... oh and if I went earlier for happy hour the fried items might have appealed to me. Friday's might have left the cheese out... but food quality is the same...medicore at best and just a place to eat and drink.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairfax-2,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.284,2.16

After that, she gave us two other checkbooks back, but they were not ours, they belonged to the party next to us and we gave them their checkbooks and they were also aggravated that their credit cards were handed over to strangers. After that, we were waiting to get our checkbooks and waited approximately 20 minutes, and when Juliet came back she did not apologize, she in fact assumed that since we were the same race as the party next to us that we were all together.

This experience has totally put us off of Friday's; my friend and I were lured in by a commercial and living so close we decided this was the only logical place to eat..mistake. Firstly, we sit at the bar which is fairly empty for 7pm on a Thursday, obviously the happy hour crew found somewhere better to be. We're greeted right away- not with a smile or anything just ""hi, my name is...what can I get you"" .. no explanation of the appetizer deal, no specials (does Friday's do specials?).

Anyways, we get out bill- singular- even though we said checkS..not a blink of her asking if we'd like it separated, luckily my friend covered for me because I only had my card and we decided if we tried to ask for it to be split a certain way it would've turned out wrong. After we sign the check..guess what shows up?! My cup of dirt...20+ minutes after I ordered..the male bartender asked who ordered it and I said oh I ordered that 20 minutes ago and cancelled it 10 minutes ago..instead of saying ""oh no I'm sorry for the wait, here you go anyways"" or anything productive.. he passes it off to a buss boy and says ""this is dead now"" in the most condescending tone- see ya, jerk.

We had to wait another 30 min because they forgot our sides.  He also looked at us as if we were inconveniencing him.  Needless to say we left no tip for the waitress who dropped our drinks off and never came back.  The same night our bank card was charged $250.00 to some random store...

As I'm waiting to be acknowledged, as it's quite difficult not to spot a new customer sitting down, I go on to be completely ignored by all 3. So, as I'm sitting down coming up with excuses of why they wouldn't even greet me (I mean, even IF they were busy, a smile, and an ""I'll be right with you"" would've been appreciated) I am a regular at Fridays, but this is my first time here, I usually go to the one in Tysons, and this is how I know what the GM's name is, as she used to work there, and she wasn't any good then, so I'm not surprised of the unpleasant encounter. I grab a menu, to waste time, and to ensure that they saw me (I practically know everything on the menu by heart) but nope, no recognition is ANY sort. After 15 minutes I ask to see a manager, she comes around with her Northface jacket, and a hoodie on her head (extremely unprofessional) and as I was mentioning to her of the situation (certainly not complaining) but merely letting her know that they need to step it up. Her response was nothing short of incompetent and what I had expected of her from the what I have heard (never believed any of them, because I've never had an issue at the Tysons location) with her uneducated and unprofessional response, I ask to see the GM, when she affirms her role as the GM with a smirk (it does not get worse than this) implying that she is the boss, and if I had any further complaints that I should let corporate know, she then cuts the conversation and says that I am out of time as she is scheduled to clock out, and if I needed to still have this addresses, that she will have her ""other"" manager listen to me. UNREAL! Being a person that is in retail, customer service, and had started off in the restaurant business; she has failed in EVERY aspect to meet my expectation as a consumer-as if I am worthless, even though customers are the ones that make or break a business, and now I fully understand why everyone gave such shitty reviews about this particular location. NO EMPLOYEE should ever disregard and belittle a customer in the matter I was treated, let alone a GENERAL MANAGER.

I arrived last night and sat down in the bar area, the whole time a man who clearly had been over served was free styling at the top of his lungs screaming profanity and vulgar sexual acts in detail that no one, especially a lady should hear. The bartender Mike who immediately gave off the attitude of not wanting to be there stopped by after 5-10 minutes to get my drink order. To try and lighten the mood I asked him ""hey what's the deal with that guy screaming made up songs about killing and raping people over there, is he drunk or something?"" Mikes response was with a condescending attitude ""I don't know, why don't you ask him yourself"" no idea where managment was during this whole ordeal. I was waiting for my girlfriend at the time and if she arrived and he hadn't stopped yelling about how he was gonna ""kill you in your kitchen?"" I was going to ask him to stop myself. Instead of the staff of the building keeping the peace it would have been left up to me I guess. I didn't know that apparently I work at a TGI Friday's... and Tuesday nights are trap house nights at Friday's. Luckily Flavor Flav's doppleganger settled down and stopped screaming by the time my old lady showed up. But luckily our meal came with a show when I was then treated to the sight of him making clearly unwanted advances on any girl within arms reach. My fingers were crossed that he would stop by my table so I could try and instigate a fight with this little drunk man. My plan was cause as much property damage as possible during the scuffle to hopefully teach the staff a lesson about not letting customers disrespect your house, and the dining experience of others.

The hostess came over and talked to the people in front of us, without even acknowledging that we were standing behind them, left and did not return. There was a line behind us and while people were waiting, most left to dine elsewhere. There were plenty of tables available and more than enough wait staff standing around.

35,Triz E.,"Arlington, VA",0,3,,1.0,2016-08-25,"I like TGIF but after today, I am never coming back even if they give me a free meal. As soon as we got there, it took longer than usual for the hostess to attend us, mind me there was not a single soul in there!!We sat next to another family that was waiting for their food. I ordered the Jack Daniels ribs w/ broccoli & mashed potatoes. My husband got a burger with fries. It took like 10 minutes for our food to be served. My ribs were ok, but the broccoli was stale and it had black spots all over it. My husband had to ask the waiter to take his burger back because it was raw. Meanwhile, the family next to me were talking to the manager complaining about the food and the service. Bottom line is, I have never had an issue with TGIF but today it was just horrible, we payed to eat trash and we might as well would have gone to eat McDonald's...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairfax-2?start=20,2.12,2.33,2.33,,2.2460000000000004

We sat in the bar area, it was around 7 so a pretty busy dinner rush and were greeted immediately. Our server Jordan was awesome! Constantly checked up on us for our endless apps, made great suggestions, and was always there for prompt drink refills. They're drink specials are great and can't go wrong with endless apps!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairfax-2?start=20,2.28,2.34,2.34,,2.316
33,Tasha B.,"Centreville, VA",0,3,,2.0,2016-09-04,"I used to love this place but now it's not even on the list of places I want to eat at.  I ordered a salad and the bruschetta chicken pasta.  My salad didn't taste fresh, I actually had to spit out one of the tomatoes because it tasted like it was molding, and my entree was mediocre/bland.  The deal they have going on currently  didn't really seem like a deal to me because my husband and I weren't allowed to share an unlimited appetizer, it's literally one per person and who eats an appetizer alone?  The rewards of the stripes program are not anything special, not to mention my accumulated points were voided simply because I hadn't eaten there in awhile.  I won't be eating here in the foreseeable future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairfax-2?start=20,2.32,2.34,2.34,,2.332

I miss the old Friday's.   Lively but separate bar; good food; and friendly professional service.

1,Cynthia V.,"VA, VA",336,23,19.0,3.0,2017-07-23,"Came here last night around 10pm. There was a huge party there already and we were sat right next to them. Would've been nice to sit somewhere else but then after a second huge party was seated right next to us. The space was kind of tight.. I mean yeah I get it's easier for the servers but it would've been nice having some space from the other parties.  It did take a couple of minutes for someone to greet us. Once our server came, she was nice but she seemed bored and uninterested. We ordered the endless apps for $10 per person, which is a pretty good deal. However this is my second time ordering this I wish they could switch up the appetizers on the endless apps menu because I'm already getting bored of what's on there. The food came in a timely manner. The food was pretty good. I think my favorite on the menu is the mozzarella sticks. Their marinara sauce is great. Their meatballs are also very good and. I like how it comes with little slices of bread to pair with. I wish we were checked up more often. She did check up on us and we wouldn't be ready to order but she wouldn't come until another 15 minutes when we needed maybe 5 more minutes. Pretty average service. Probably would go to another chain restaurant where the service is more attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairfax-2,2.72,2.42,2.42,,2.54

Havent gone to this location much but still! Thanks to the lady using me as a training example and making me feel embarrassed with the other person in my party!
