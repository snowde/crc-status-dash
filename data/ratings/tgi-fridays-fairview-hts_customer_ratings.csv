38,Gwen U.,"Belleville, IL",8,5,1.0,1.0,2015-06-06,"My children decided they wanted to dine here for my two daughters birthdays. At first the greeter seemed quite friendly. We were seated right away but our waitress did not come to the table until almost 15 minutes to ask what drinks we would like. After ordering drinks we waited an additional 17 minutes before they were brought to the table and were able to order food. At a glance, many other tables were not being properly served. The staff was very unorganized and clumsy. When the food finally arrived steaks, burgers, salmon and pasta was cold to the touch. My sons steak was tough and cooked very well done when he ordered medium rare. The salmon was tough and almost rubbery. When the waitress came by to ask us if our food was alright we asked to speak to the manager. He refused to come to the table. So my husband stepped up and went into the kitchen to have a chat with him. We asked for new food, he refused. He asked to me compensated for the food. Manager said no. He told my husband there was nothing wrong with the dishes and when we presented them he simply replied ""that's how we serve the food"". Eventually one of the dishes was taken off the bill but we immediately left and my younger children were in tears. I approached the manager and very clearly and loudly stated how the service and his treatment of the situation would influence us never to go back. Others agreed and left the restaurant as well.

48,Tiffany S.,"Edwardsville, IL",39,13,,3.0,2015-07-22,"My boyfriend and I were severely disappointed upon eating at TGI Friday's.  We elected to sit at the bar this night. After a minute or two, the bartender (I won't mention specific names here) comes over and takes our drink order. I got my long island immediately, which I must say, was excellent. TGI is my favorite place to order long islands. My boyfriend ordered a double Bulleit. She gave him a bit of a blank look and asked him what that was. No problem - Bulleit is not a particularly well known bourbon (although it is clearly printed on your drink menu). She disappears for a while, I assume to look for the Bulleit. About 15-20 minutes later, she comes back, pours a Makers on the rocks, and sets it in front of my boyfriend. No acknowledgment that this is not what he ordered at all.  After another 10 or so minutes, we place our orders. Food was excellent - I can never complain too much about their food. After we finished eating, we decided on another round of drinks. He orders the drinks for us and she rings them in and places the new receipt in front of us and walks away. After not seeing her for another 5-10 minutes, we decide to flag her down and tell her we're not going to have the last round and we're just going to go. Typically receive great service here, so as I said, I'm pretty disappointed. I overheard the bartender complain about how busy she was because she was the only bartender on that night. It was a fairly typical week night - pretty sure Friday's has one bartender on weeknights because they can usually handle that. She seemed fairly new to bar tending though. My advice to Friday's - staff a more experience bartender to work with the new ones.  I'll probably still be back - maybe on a Friday or Saturday when I know they'll have more than one bartender working.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairview-hts?start=20,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348

This is clearly not the demographic for techno music, causing the babies to shreak louder and the people to shout.

First off I heard that endless apps were back and I have loved this before as it really lets you feel like you got your moneys worth but after arriving I was informed since I ordered bufflo wings I was limited to only that and only the buffalo flavor, the limit to the wings is understanding but why cant I switch flavors. I ordered the endless wings my wife ordered a burger, my appetizer comes out way before my wifes burger infact my wife had to wait 45 minutes to get her burger. My first order of wings was good hot and had sauce I shared with my wife seeing as she was hungry too. After my first plate I ordered a second and joined my wife in the waiting game. Once our food finally came out my wifes burger was cold, burnt, and had been siting ready to be brought out for 15 minutes and my wings were cold with no buffalo flavor basically battered chicken. Our server though nice she was not very attentive she disappeared for 20 minutes a while we waited for drink refills ( which was all we had since we had to wait for our food so long). I ordered one last playe of wings and left for good we will not be back at this location as customer service is keey with us so we will make the trip to St. Louis to our regular T.G.I.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairview-hts?start=40,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148

24,Drew P.,"Tucson, AZ",52,225,225.0,3.0,2015-08-27,"So this is a brand new TGI Friday!! I think they may still be trying to work out some other kinks though. The appetizer did not come out until the entrees arrived the manager did come by and see sorry but I think more appropriate solution would have been to take the appetizer off our bill since we waited for 40 minutes to get it and it didn't arrive and we had to make the choice to let the appetizer get packed up at the end so our entrees didn't go cold. I ordered a steak and the steak was almost cooked correctly but it was overcooked by a temperature. I ordered medium rare and the state come out as medium well. So, I mentioned this to the waitress and she apologized and and didn't offer to replace it. Again I think they are just having growing pains. She was very pleasant and my other two friends that was with me and really enjoyed their food. Basing this review of that entire experience rather than just mine. The other issue I encountered was I ordered a strawberry lemonade and every refill cost me money. I have two things to say about this the wait staff should have told me first and the restaurant is being very greedy. When I asked why they charge for every single 1 the response that was given to me was because they garnish with fresh strawberries. So I would think if they were going to be this greedy they could at least offer the patrons free refills and only do the garnishing on the 1st drink in if the patron once the strawberries then charge them for a full drink. It really irks me restaurants are getting so stingy with their customers. I was already paying and increased amount for the strawberry lemonade I think its funny they do both charging more for the drink and not allow refills on it.GRR",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairview-hts?start=40,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444

The service was good but the prices are just dumb. Paying $7 for two sliders when I could have probably just ordered a normal burger meal for the same price! The potato skins tasted like the frozen kind you but in stores now. I haven't been to a TGI Fridays inn forever and it may be another few years before I run out of other options for sports bars to go to with the food options like this. At least they didn't try selling me truffle burgers but may as well when you're paying 7 bucks a 1/8 ounce for ground beef.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairview-hts?start=20,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412
56,Madi R.,"Mount Pulaski, IL",4,3,,2.0,2015-09-13,"Me and my family came here for a dinner of endless appetizers. We love the one in Springfield so what could go wrong at this one.  We get seated no problem there was no wait even though it was a little crowded. We order are first appetizer rounds and ordered drinks, no special drinks just sodas and waters. The first appetizers came no problem other than the French onion dumplings were lukewarm at best. I have ran out of water and do not get any water for around 10-15 minutes. Not really a huge deal since they were somewhat still busy for dinner.  We have 6 people in our party, only 5 order the endless appetizers. After the first round the waitress suddenly disappears from our table only. She's helping others diligently yet we are still waiting on beverages and it take about 15-20 minutes for our next appetizers to come out even though it is no longer busy. Our waitress is never at the table so the cooks have to bring out the appetizers.  Our last round of appetizers don't come out for what seems like forever. We get some of them but there are three still missing. We actually never get those three appetizers. So we are pretty upset. When my mother and I ask for new waters the waitress take our glasses to the drink station and proceeds to place our straws on the counter.  ! I repeat she puts them on the counter!  This is outrageous by itself! She then decides to pick up our straws bare handed and place them back in the cups! I mean honestly how could you!  Cleanliness of the restaurant is fair. Bathroom is fair other than its freezing. We are still sitting at our table waiting for food. The other employees begin cleaning the tables and the place for closing. This is just rude.  It just makes you feel like you're unwanted or a hassle for them.  In conclusion don't go here for endless apps or if you want a quick trip.

25,d m.,"San Marcos, CA",3,28,,1.0,2015-10-23,"My husband and daughter and I went here and I wish we had not.  The place is clean and staff are friendly but the food is horrible and the tv's played womens golf.  Seriously? My husband and I were starving and not picky eaters.  The menu pictures looked awesome.  We ordered the Ahi Tuna Crisps appetizer for about $9 but they were dried out fish with toppings on a few tortilla chips (4 to be exact).  There was so little food there.  They lacked any taste.  How they accomplished that I have no idea. We both ordered the All-American Stacked Burger and the burger was absolutely soaked and dripping in grease (our plates had pools of grease when we picked them up --- about 1/2 cup worth at least on each).  The meat (which we asked for med-rare and pink inside) was well done & then some.  The meat was so dried out from over cooking it was chewy.  I struggled to chew it.  The tomato and lettuce was wilted and so thin you could see thru them both.  They looked nothing like the photos in the menu.  The burger in the menu looks like you get 2 juicy thick (3/4-1"") patties, and what we got looked like a flat pancake (maybe 1/4"" each). My husband had mango pineapple lemonade and it was so sweet it was hard to drink. My daughter ordered the children's meal slider cheeseburgers.  There were 2 with french fries, but only one came with cheese (the only barely had a tsp which was melted burnt).  The little slider cheeseburgers were so overly cooked they were as hard as hockey pucks and she could not eat them (even the buns).  I even tried cutting one up, then tried it myself when she could not eat it that way too.  It was awful.  She had not eaten all day and she usually will eat any & everything.  The chocolate milk it came with looked ok but was without chocolate flavor. Out of the whole set of 3 meals ordered, the only thing we could eat was the french fries & the only drink was my water. We looked at each other like the whole meal was a bad joke played on us. It was so bad and off the mark, we are not going back.  For burgers, got to Red Robin.  They are so good and look just like the pictures.  For steaks, Long Horn or Smokey Bones.

44,Kalesia M.,"Chicago, IL",11,4,1.0,1.0,2015-11-28,"Now I want to preface this with that I know that it is a chain restaurant and that it isn't going to be the best place I've ever eaten, but the service that my party received was deplorable.   My friend, her baby boy, my sister, my toddler daughter and I went to grab a bite on Black Friday. The parking lot was pretty empty (which should have been a sign as it is the busiest shopping day of the year and no one was there). We were seated immediately behind the bar. Our server took our drink order and promptly brought us our drinks (messing up on the first one but that was no big deal it happens). We then took ours and our children's orders. As we waited (30 minutes) for our food we noticed the staff sitting at the first table you see as you come in (and it is right in front of us). The table is cluttered with cleaning supply's and the staffs drinks. It is pretty unsightly but whatever we move on with our meal. One of the babies spilled their drink. We asked for a towel to clean it up. The waitress brought over three napkins and left. She didn't offer to help at all. Finally another waitress dropped off a towel after noticing that we had a large pile of wet napkins in the middle of the table (a pile we had to find someone to take and throw away!) When our food finally came out the babies food was missing. Know one told us if it would be out in a second and our waitress didn't come to check to see if we were doing alright. After 10 mins we finally had to stop another waitress and ask her to go get it. The food was decent, but our table was not cleared once while we were there. Neither was the table next to us. All the while employees are chatting and changing for work at this front table in front of us. A girl changed her shoes there and everything.  Finally I had enough and spotted a manager. I went up to him and told him that his staff look extremely unprofessional sitting at that table which is the first thing any customer sees let alone what we have had to stare at this entire time. I also told him about the table next to us that hadn't been cleared since the people left 30 minutes before. He looked at me bewildered and said, ""I can see how you can feel that is unprofessional."" As annoyed as I was by his phrasing I let it go because he got the staff to clean up that nasty table and not chill in front of customers (as it should be) and go and clean the table. We paid our check and was about to leave but I was still annoyed that he didn't come check that we were ok. I asked the waitress to ask him to come over and I told him how unprofessional he has been. He tells me how it is a shift change and tries to defend his unprofessional behavior to me! He then finally tries to see if he can remedy the situation by with a bill reduction but I cut him off before he offers to tell him that it wasn't about getting a free meal. I told him that he had lost a customer and we would be reporting that incident to corperate. He said ok and walked off. I have never seen such blatant disregard for the customer in my life.

42,Carmen J.,"Collierville, TN",1,11,2.0,1.0,2016-03-12,"I visit TGIFridays fairly regularly, but tonight's visit will certainly change that. First off, my waiter has about as much personality as a shoe. Secondly, the food has zero flavor. We ordered  the baby back ribs and the Sizzling Chicken and Shrimp. Whomever is in the kitchen....FORGOT TO SEASON THE FOOD....The ribs came out WITH NO SAUCE(two tablespoons of sauce were in a little cup). The sizzling chicken never sizzled and was dry. The saving grace of the visit was the manager offering to exchange the items.  Funny thing is as soon as I asked for a manager, the server said, ""Oh, about the ribs?"" So, I'm wondering just how many complaints they receive about the ribs. TGIFRIDAYS....not a good visit for us this time. UPDATE: The replacement orders have taken over 30 minutes to come out(and still haven't come out)!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairview-hts?start=20,2.28,2.28,2.28,2.084,2.28

40,Parmela P.,"Kirkwood, Saint Louis, MO",127,61,243.0,1.0,2016-04-07,"Terrible service, average food, unclean restrooms. That equals a big, fat, one-star rating from me! Had lunch with my hubby here today. We arrived right at noon and the restaurant was not very busy. Seated right away in the bar area which was fine with us, but it meant our server was also the bartender. Once our food was served (by someone else), we never saw our server again until she asked if we wanted dessert. No checking to see if our meal was acceptable, NO drink refills, nothing. It took 35 minutes from the time we placed our order until we received it. Completely unacceptable for a workday lunch. The last nail in the 1-star coffin was my trip to the restroom. There is NO way, with only being open for just over an hour, that the restroom needed that much attention. Clearly this was some leftover from the night before and no manager could have possibly inspected this as some of what I saw was FAR more than just one day's problem. This location was torn down and completely rebuilt not even a year ago. It's inexplicable to me how the new place has been allowed to go downhill so quickly. But after my experience, I can see why they only have a 2.5 star rating. And from my observations, it's all on the management, or lack thereof.

We ordered drinks, an appetizer, & an entrée. First horrible experience, I had the Tropical Long Island Ice Tea that didn't taste tropical at all! It had some overpowering mint taste & I refused to finish it. My friend had a Strawberry Daiquiri that tasted watered down with pieces of ice throughout it. We didn't complain. Next, our old tasting, grease soaked potato skins came out... Couldn't eat them & sent those back. Finally the entrée...we both ordered the Ribeye & Half Rib Dinner. Big Mistake! Well, the steak was good but the Ribs... They were so dried out and tasteless! It was like biting into crackling! When we sent the ribs back, we were told that customers always send those back. What???!!! If you knew they were horrible, why let us order that crap?! After the returned food, no manager came over to ask us about our meal or offer a discount due to our disappointments. The ghost manager did take off the potato skins and horrific ribs but we still came out of $54 and some change for a less than ideal experience. We won't be going back! Nice building though.

They always seem to have a new drink on the menu and the rewards are a plus.  New drink ""tropical Long Island""... Highly don't recommend! Not sure if it's the mixed liquor but it's taste like the plant soaking in it.  However, they do have other great drinks! The food is normally fast. Surprising the baby back ribs are awesome! Fall off the bone dry rub or sauced, either is good to me.  The atmosphere is beautiful in the new building, tv's set up for the games and even a nice fire pit on the patio!  Great place for lunch, drinks with family and/or friends.  Only thing is they don't take reservations for large parties but guess you have to have a backup plan if the wait is long.

45,Stacey B.,"Collinsville, IL",52,51,11.0,4.0,2016-07-10,Walked in the door and the hostess asked if a booth was okay and when I told her no she seemed inconvenienced. So we got the tiny table by the bathrooms which was fine.  The waiter Jacob was very prompt for the drink order and was very attentive.  As we waited for our food they had live music playing in the bar area which would have been a lot more enjoyable if the overhead speakers would not have been competing with him. This was very annoying and made my dinner less relaxing.  I had the chicken Parmesan it had a great flavor but a bit too much bread crumbs. My daughter had the chicken club. Over all it was good except the bacon was greasy. Like it had sat in the bottom of a bin all day. Husband had the bourbon chicken which also had great flavor but was a lot smaller portioned than my chicken.  The waiter is what gives this place the 4 stars. The minus one is due to the few food issues and the overbearing music.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairview-hts?start=20,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

We arrived at 10:25, and by 11 p.m. still didn't have our appetizers. How long does it take for potato skins? Oh and if you want silverware, you'll have to get up and ask for some at the bar. Or at least I did. Maybe if I saw my server more than every 15 minutes I could have asked for some. Drink refills? Nah. I mean why would you get a refill on a drink it took you 25 minutes to get on the first place right? I gave two stars because the food was decent.

I ordered the Jack Daniels sliders for my entree and the other people had the original JD burger. While it didn't bother us, per se, the food took a substantially long time to arrive. Luckily, we were there to visit. First thing I observed was how small the JD burgers have gotten. The price is the same, however. Disappointed in the value. My sliders were beyond well done. One part of the pattie was so bad you could hear it hit the plate. I included a picture. Not sure I will be back unless I only plan to have drinks with friends or family.

I've always been a fan of Friday's and I enjoy how they've reinvented themselves over the years. Raven was our server, she was ok until the food came. I ordered a turkey burger with cheddar cheese and sweet potato fries, my husband ordered the Jack Daniel chicken and shrimp. Our food comes out and I have American cheese instead of cheddar, regular fries instead of sweet and my husband only has chicken and missing shrimp. On top of that we were waiting on utensils. One of my biggest pet peeves from a server is one who isn't aware of their customers needs. We bring it up to Raven, you know what she says? ""I called it in right.."" well good on you, but you need to follow through until the end or there wouldn't have been so many mistakes. Additionally, we also ordered the endless app of potstickers and never got a new plate. Again no situational awareness, it seemed like one thing after another here.
