84,Meg N.,"Waltham, MA",14,14,,1.0,2013-02-11,"After the blizzard of 2013 the staff will play! My roommate and I went to this Fridays Sunday 2/10 around 6pm after the blizzard. We were seated by a decent host in the resturaunt section. We first sat around for about 20 minutes before even meeting a server of any kind. Our server Stacey checked the hostess booth finally to realize they we were seated in her section. She came up and seemed attentive after the whole ""I didn't know who was serving you guys"" mishap. By the time we had met Stacey we had our drinks, appetizers and meals all ready to order. So we ordered our entire meal right away, asking for our appetizers and wedge salads out first. The food came out in a decent time frame, although at this time a mother and daughter were seated after us and they ended up getting there meals and left before we even got our meals. Stacey took awhile getting back to our table it always seemed like she was busy and unavailable. I continued to give her the benefit of the doubt until our dessert came. My roommate got the brownie obsession and halfway through eating it pulled out a long brown hair. now my roommate has brown hair so she thought it was hers and let it slide until after we finished our dessert and noticed our lovely waitress Stacey standing in the KITCHEN playing with her hair while the food was being prepped. My roommate watched this waitress close to 20 minutes while she played and brushed her hair in the kitchen chit chatting it up with other waitresses while we waited over 20 minutes for our dessert to be taken away and our check to be given to us. In the additional 15 minutes it took for her to take our check and payment, we witnessed the hostesses and waitresses in front of the resturaunt slapping each others asses. GREAT professionalism ladies. I still left Stacey a 12$ tip on a 57$ bill because my roommate so nicely put it ""some people have bad days, like a bad hair day!"" With my 12$ Stacey, invest in a hairbrush so you don't track your hair in others food!

She started giving him an attitude after he said he want to ask the bartender himself. The bartender finally came and she was also rude. She asked him what channel the game was on and he didn't reply fast enough so she mumbled under her breath and I couldn't really hear what she said but my brother did.

My boyfriend ordered soda and never received it so he asked the waitress and she gave him an attitude again and argued with him saying he never ordered it. We expected to get our appetizers first but we received it later with our meals.

We didn't see our bartender again until my husband put cash in the cup, showing we were ready to check out. Not one word from bartender. I was mad at my husband for leaving a 20 percent tip on what the full price of the meal would have been (apps are half price on Sundays)? We will never go back.

38,Dave M.,"Wayland, MA",8,1,,2.0,2014-06-21,"This visit was just kind of strange. We were feeling a little snacky before finishing up some shopping, so around 2pm we stopped in for some food and a drink. It was a very slow time for the restaurant, yet it was exceedingly cluttered with food and dishes at tables where the customers had long ago left; one large table in particular had still not been cleaned the entire time of our visit. The most concerning part was that there were a lot of people working at the time! A dirty, cluttered environment does not make for a very good first impression. From there, it was just a matter of the service, and the food. Our meal was decent: good prices for the items we got, and tasty, but the service was.. not great. Our waiter seemed to be having a wonderful time serving the table next to ours, but to us he was quite forgetful, slow, and made no effort to really be anything more than an obstacle in between us and our food/ beverages. When we had our beverages and were waiting to place our order, he simply walked up to our table and pulled out his pen and paper without saying a word.  I had meant to make this a shorter review, so I'll wrap it up.

His snide attitude was even noticeable by others I was with. They were shocked at his pompous demeanor. I got home and noticed my meal was not in the bag. I not only got bad service.

What we like:   (Remember, this is a chain restaurant) Good variety of food, apps & drinks. I can find anything I'm in the mood for - chicken, beef, fish - salads, sandwiches, entrees. Prices are affordable and pretty ok for what you get. Plenty of parking. Not so busy as to wait for a table or barstool (double edged sword though) What we didn't like: We like to eat at the bar and watch TV, and wanted to choose some drinks from the cocktail & specials menus. BUT - I really hate that there are no prices on the menu, which makes it hard to choose a drink. The bartender explained that ""some of these are around 8 or nine dollars.  The tequilas are more, maybe 10-12. ""  I want to know for sure, not ABOUT how much, since that could be most of our bill.  grrrr.  The specials menu, not available, they had little binders behind the bar but no longer available. huh? Drinks come with no straws, then you pick one from a bunch located on the bar top, that aren't wrapped, that kind of grossed me out. Children are allowed in the bar, and some were sitting right behind us at the long divider table. I just don't feel that's appropriate, and it made it kind of uncomfortable for me. They belong in the restaurant, not listening to me curse at sports! Apps came out fast and hot, but our food followed much too soon, so we had to juggle plates and rush through the apps. It was pretty obviously annoying, but we had plenty of room at the bar to take up the 2 spots on either side with our plates. Jack Daniels burger was ok, cooked medium as requested, but the bacon was one piece way overdone burnt, one piece almost raw-limp. Bun soaked through and hard to eat. Very small amount of fries.

81,Tyler D.,"Auburn, MA",42,5,,2.0,2015-03-08,"After driving from Auburn to Natick for the sole reason of going to the Cheesecake Factory, I was ready to eat. However, the wait for the Cheesecake Factory (55-75 minutes) was so long, that my girlfriend and I decided to just buy some cheesecake and find somewhere else to eat dinner. For some reason however, everyone in the greater Boston area decided to go out to eat that night so it was impossible to find a place that had a wait less than a half an hour. Although it's true that we could have just went somewhere and waited, it seemed easier to drive aimlessly around looking for somewhere that could spare the room to quickly feed two hungry souls (the mind works in mysterious ways when you're food deprived). After driving down route 9 for what seemed like an eternity (about 10 minutes) a beacon of hope glimmered in the distance; a beacon of hope in the form of a Tgi Friday's sign. However, I like to eat food that's fresh and doesn't make me have to poop, so we kept driving. But eventually my girlfriend and I succumbed to the hunger and pulled into Tgi Friday's. We walked inside and were greeted with a 5 minute wait. The service was good and the waiter, Josh, was pretty good. He also looked like a celebrity but we couldn't figure out who and it will probably drive me crazy for many years to come. When the food finally came out, I was surprised. It tasted pretty good for food that was fresh out of the freezer. I was actually surprised at how not terrible the experience was. The bathrooms were a complete mess and there were poop stains in the toilets, but it's Tgi Friday's so honestly what do you expect (I also had s gift card so everything was free and I like free stuff). After we left and the night continued on, I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't have to run to the bathroom. But this morning came and I got what Was coming to me. Rip to my toilet. Overall summary, it's a Tgi Friday's that has pretty good service and ok food that won't make you have to poop right away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-framingham?start=60,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.9600000000000002,2.0

I ordered a pasta and it took 55 minutes.  My husband ordered ribs and not only did he get the wrong flavor but they came out 20 minutes before my pasta. Who knew pasta took so long to cook. Our waiter was rude and very slow and he manager was even worse! No one was apologetic for the wait even when it was obvious there was something wrong since all the tables around us turned before we even got our meal!  Not to mention they over charged us and I over heard the manager talking to the waiter about us in the kitchen.

65,Charlotte H.,"Natick, MA",96,14,,1.0,2015-12-14,"It used to be great, but our last visit will probably be our last. On November 27, 2014, my son requested Fridays for his birthday dinner. The initial portion of the meal was more irritating than awful. Our waiter seemed very new, so we gave the benefit of the doubt on a few things, including our service being slow and our son's order being forgotten (never received an explanation of why his food came out much later, but it was clear the kitchen never made it, whether he didn't put it in or they didn't make it). I also had to speak to the manager and wait over 15 minutes for a drink because I was declared too young looking for my ID and they didn't have an operational ID scanner to confirm. The manager explained the concern about underage drinkers and college being out better than my server, who stated something about secondary ID, didn't explain what would suffice as secondary ID, and left the table.  The BAD part came when my son with multiple food allergies wanted dessert. Now Fridays started this for us years ago on their suggestion, since he can't have the Cup of Dirt dessert but can have the gummy worms they put on top, they usually bring him a plate of worms and sing to him. There has been some turnover, so the waitstaff we knew are gone. I asked the waiter nicely to do the same, and explained you can still sing to a kid with a plate of worms, even though there's no cake or candle. Plate of worms comes out, plunked on table, the end. Wouldn't have been so upsetting to my son or to me except that the little girl next to him was sung to, and he's nine. I have been trying to explain ever since why they would leave him out. I wrote to corporate on the 28th and they said I would receive a call from a GM or manager from the location, and as of 12/13/15 there was zero call, so here I am taking it public. My son has requested that his future birthdays be somewhere else.  I still tipped well since that's how we roll, but it in no way indicates we were pleased with our two-hour experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-framingham?start=40,2.08,2.08,2.08,2.052,2.08

My friend and I were there at 12:30 for lunch with our kids - one 11 year old and two 6 year olds. The six year olds ordered the kids meal chicken tenders. These were the only two meals done correctly. The 11 year old wanted an entree portion of the pasta on their menu, but with butter and Parmesan rather than marinara. After placing our order in the kitchen, our waitress came back, clearly agitated, saying, ""My manager treats me like such crap. He's asking if I'm just making up my own menu because of the pasta order."" This goes on and on. When it comes out, it's a kid sized portion with no cheese. They ended up putting another order in and that took 40 minutes for it to hit the table. My friend and I ordered two of the endless apps - potstickers and the BBQ flatbread. We only got one round of it. After the waitress put in for the next fill, it was 45 minutes and nothing came out. We ended up asking for our check. The waitress kept saying about how the manager treats her so unfairly....how she's quitting after her shift....I felt bad. I truly did. After we got the bill, it turns out that she put $10 of her own cash on our bill to take care of one of the apps! We asked to speak to the manager. He came over and while we were explaining our disappointment in the kitchen service and the turn around, he was looking at the 6 year olds, making faces, and laughing.

The food was fine, we got an appetizer platter, my husband's burger was cooked as he asked. But a restaurant is more that just food.  So with the experience we had, we won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-framingham,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24

Staff does really make an establishment what it is, maybe they should stop employing kids who don't want to work. Anyway folks happy I left there chowing with my little guy now in a booth !!!!  Depending on how I feel by Monday .....they may or may not get a call from my attorney!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-framingham,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
1,Maggie P.,"Washington, DC",30,98,44.0,5.0,2017-12-07,"I was in the mood for junk chain food and cheap beer (don't judge) and TGI Fridays was the closest place around that fit the bill. We got there at 9:30 on Wednesday night, just as trivia was wrapping up. The place was nearly dead other than at the bar which is where Beau + big sis and I also sat. Bartender was GREAT! Super friendly, attentive even while extremely busy, and generally on point. Food was exxxxactly what I wanted and then some. *Pro tip: they have unwritten late night $5 appetizer specials - ask your bartender for specifics* $5 Pretzels were super hot, beer cheese that accompanied was amazing, and Beau couldn't get enough of the (also $5) spinach/cheese dip with freshly fried tortilla chips (impressive, Fridays!). My shrimp ""wrap"" on naan with balsamic tomatoes and tzatziki isn't your typical Fridays fare but the flavors melded wonderfully. Most impressive dish was Beau's cobb -- insanely fresh veggies and loaded with all the goodies restaurants usually skimp on (y'know: avocado, bacon strips, Bleu cheese). It was beautiful. Enough salad to easily feed two.  Bottom line: this Fridays did the chain proud! Kudos to the kitchen and the lovely bartender.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-framingham,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
0,JD H.,"Natick, MA",0,32,14.0,4.0,2017-12-12,"If you want to eat dinner at 10 pm in the metro-west, your options are limited.  TGI Fridays is the one place you can always count on to be open. There's never a wait at that time and we usually get a terrific wait person. The Manager, ""M"" really makes an effort to make sure you enjoy your meal.   No one rushes you to leave, which means conversation can continue. There's something for everyone in your party - good burgers, decent steaks and tasty appetizers.  It is a chain restaurant and it's not a foodie paradise, but it offers good food at reasonable prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-framingham,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
6,Joey B.,"Framingham, MA",0,1,,2.0,2018-01-08,The service is great the nachos are not. The cheese is spinach dip I'm pretty sure.. it's gross.

3,Mariana M.,"Brighton, Boston, MA",46,3,1.0,1.0,2018-01-14,"We walked in and nobody acknowledged our presence for around 5 min... A host, looking bored and unenthusiastic, showed up and informed us about a 20 min wait time, even thought they had more than 20 free tables around the room! Poor consumer service. I love Fridays but I won't come back to this specific one. Two tables of 7 people got to seat before us (2). Ridiculous",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-framingham,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
