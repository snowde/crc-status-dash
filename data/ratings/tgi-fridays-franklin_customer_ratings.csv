27,Elliott W.,"Franklin, TN",134,195,10.0,3.0,2012-01-08,"Ah the reminiscence of 1992. The sense that the menu has changed only incrementally, with the addition of the Jack Daniel's brand on half the menu (not that you can taste any JD). Booth after booth of high school daters, convention attendees, and families. TGI Friday's is comfortable, friendly, and reasonably priced. Especially if you stick with the specials, which I did not. I pushed my 8 year old through the door. He said it was too ""authentic"". Apparently the over-branding of the word ""authentic"" has come to mean corporate to him. He said there were too many pictures. But then he said he liked them. Ahh, the mind of a child. Anyway, after eating he's decided that Friday's is now his favorite. Right up there with Chili's. I'm sure he'd throw 5 stars to Applebees and Ruby Tuesday too. We don't have a Bennigans or a Houlihan's anymore. And that place on Sidco that everybody used to love - what was it called? It's an antique store now. He would have LOVED it. Anyway, Friday's in comfort food. Not particularly innovative or even especially well executed. We started with the requisite Potato skins. Wonderful terrible potato skins. A happy indulgence. The bigger boy and I shared a rack of ""Jack Daniel's"" ribs. I'm not sure that I tasted any JD.  Perhaps they cooked a few drops in to every gallon of Cattlemen's sweet sauce at some point. The ribs were typical of chain restaurant BBQ. Braised and finished on the grill. Yes, fall off the bone. I don't like using a fork to eat my ribs. The ginger lime slaw was good. I finished with the vanilla bean cheesecake. The plate it was delivered on was weird - about 18 inches long by 4 inches wide. Who's idea was that? Anyway, I enjoyed it. Sara had the JD Salmon, which was good, along with some very good cornbread.   Service was good and attentive. All in all, nothing special. expectations were met and comfort received.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-franklin?start=20,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005
28,Megan W.,"Nashville, TN",10,87,69.0,3.0,2012-05-15,"For some context, I'd just had two very long days and went here with some family around 11 P.M. a few nights ago. I was tired, but excited about all the work I'd just done and I was pretty hungry and this was one of the only places open in the Cool Springs area within a short driving distance. The hostess was very friendly for this late in the evening and knew who I was wearing (Betsey Johnson for you fashionistas) which made me smile. Our server was friendly, but throughout the whole evening was a tiny bit sluggish on coming back every time. The restaurant wasn't that busy that I could tell--and just so you know, I was in the waitressing business myself for over a year. I decided to get the Turkey Burger with a side of sweet potato fries. First off, I hardly ever have turkey burgers, so I'm no expert on them, but this one was just okay. I got it plain since I don't like a bajillion toppings on my burgers (cow meat or turkey meat) and just put some ketchup on it; like I said, it was just okay. The sweet potato fries are in a close tie to the worst I've ever had, and I feel like it's hard to mess up sweet potato fries. They were salted and peppered, which I find to be a desecration; all you need on a sweet potato ANYTHING is cinnamon and perhaps some butter. Salt is okay on regular fries, but not sweet potato fries. Sweet and salty does NOT work in this case; all I could taste was the salt. EW. My experience wasn't terrible, but it could have been a lot better. I know it was late, but if they're going to stay open that late, they need to make sure their service is up to par with the earlier hours of the day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-franklin?start=20,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005

19,John S.,"Austin, TX",234,346,107.0,1.0,2013-01-12,"Let's make it real simple - came here Sunday night, ate the blue cheese something burger, woke up Tuesday at 5am, and haven't left the bathroom since (it's Friday night).  I'd usually provide more detail but it's all pretty irrelevant when a place you go to for food has food that makes your insides cry for 4 days.

20,Terri H.,"Franklin, TN",101,505,148.0,3.0,2013-04-23,"Love the Jack Daniels menu! The staff had trouble trying to decide where to seat us when we arrived.  I guess it was shift change.  My friend and I had been to the spa for our first facials and we were having a late lunch.  The waiter seated us and said he would find someone to take our order.  He came back a few minutes later and said I guess I will be waiting on you.  The other waiter in the area was careful not to make eye contact.  I guess we were keeping them from getting off work or something.  The service was slow so it was a very good thing we weren't in a hurry. Food tends to be more important than service when you aren't in a hurry.  I ordered the Jack Daniel's chicken and shrimp with sweet potato fries.  I also ordered a drink as I expected the food to take just as long to get to our table as the time it took for someone to take our order.  The Jackberry Smash was very refreshing with the perfect blend of Jack Daniels, peach schnapps, blackberries, fresh mint, and Sprite.  The Jack Daniels sauce for the chicken came on the side instead of glazed like the menu said but the chicken was good and tender and even better when dipped in the sauce.  The crispy Cajun-spiced shrimp was even better than the chicken and the sweet potato fries were very good.  I appreciate a restaurant that provides healthier options for sides.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-franklin?start=20,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997

23,Grace Anne H.,"Franklin, TN",9,11,8.0,5.0,2014-02-02,An amazing veggie burger!!! It's called the Sedona black bean burger. It was so flavorful and much more satisfying than ground beef. Pretty surprising from a chain but you can't pass it up.  As for the service...it was great too! We went on Friday night so it was pretty crowded and our waiter was on top of it. The food came out fast and hot. There was a monthly drink special and my blackberry margarita was cheap and strong! A win win!  I recommend this resturant. There is something for everyone.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-franklin?start=20,2.324,2.324,2.324,2.324,2.324
30,John S.,"Nashville, TN",34,12,1.0,1.0,2014-03-15,Not sure why I am reviewing a big chain like this. This is my experience only for the location in Franklin. The others might be better. We went here for lunch and thought since the parking lot was empty we'd get lunch within a reasonable amount of time. Wrong! We were there over 40 minutes before we got our food. When it came it was cold and bland. I had the french dip and it was tasteless. Another one to scratch off my list. None of the other 3 guys I was with liked their food either.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-franklin?start=20,,,,,

I went out on a limb and ordered a Newcastle and combined with the burger I had a party in my mouth. The only disappointing part of my Sunday at Friday's was, well, the Titans first half. They can't seem to play their way out of a paper bag. I'm hoping for a stronger ""hotter"" second half.  Fridays has new menus and if you're looking for a friendly group to hang with, this is your place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-franklin,,,,,
21,Jeff W.,"Clarkston, MI",26,3,,2.0,2015-04-28,"Guess I should have checked Yelp first! Not many cars in the parking lot when I pulled up. Walked in to the bar for dinner. Had to step around a ladder that was placed for now apparent reason. Tostado Nachos were as expected. However from my seat, I can see five television screens. (Six, if I turn my head a bit.) Four of them are on the same channel, and the fifth one has the DirecTV logo bouncing around. Oh, and the Cinco de Mayo decorations are being put up. At 6:30 on Tuesday, the 28th of April. Seems that could wait until customers have left...guess that explains the ladder.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-franklin?start=20,,,,,
12,Karem V.,"Orlando, FL",6,5,,2.0,2015-07-16,"My fiancé and I are in the area for work this week and decided to stop at Friday's after getting a promotional email.  We walked in, noticed there was no one hostess and made our way to the bar. The bar was very messy and only 5 other people were sitting, a party of 3, an off the clock employee and their friend. The service was very slow and the bartenders looked like they didn't want to be there and/or annoyed.  My fiancé ordered the Cajun chicken pasta and I ordered the Summer Fields Salad. The Cajun Chicken Pasta came out first, very hot and tasteful. My salad came out and it looked very good. After one bite I knew something was off. The Cheese was half melted, 2 chicken slices were cooked all the way, the other 2 had a slight pink center, there was too much dressing, not enough strawberries and it was warm. I took 4 bites and pushed the plate away.  Not sure why the service was crappy and so slow. Our bartender didn't ask us how our food was and it took almost 10 minutes to get my fiancé another drink. Hopefully management sees these reviews and does something about it.  I think we will continue to go to Applebee's the service and food is much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-franklin,,,,,
15,Brian T.,"Spring Hill, TN",0,65,2.0,3.0,2015-10-18,"If you've read any of my other reviews then you know I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants but I frequent them because I want to find a place that does it right. That makes me walk away feeling satisfied that my wallet goes light and my stomach grumbles with ecstasy.  With TGI Fridays I may have found a game changer that no one else has, an 70/30 split of satisfied to disgusted. A bill I don't gawk at and despise at its inception. My wife and I frequent this establishment for two reasons: Service and Tostado Nachos. Oh my god, these tostadas are fantastic most of the time with the exception of once out of 11. I can't believe an appetizer has me up in arms but good god they are fantastic. I could make a meal of them and I have. I have tried authentic tostadas only to come away thinking, am I too used to Americanized food?  Am I not cultured enough to enjoy authentic food from other great cultures? The answer is simply yes, I'm an Ohio transplanted in Tennessee who loves Mom & Pop joints so much that I can't see past the good ol red, white and blue. Shame on my heritage for enjoying this country.  I usually get the chicken tenders here because this is the ONLY place I've been to that ""hand batters"" them correctly. And by correctly I mean when you bite into them, the breading does not fall off the chicken and crumbles in your hand, it magically stays on and encrusts the chicken with a nice crunch. The fries are fries, nothing spectacular but hey, they could be worse (insert Logan's Roadhouse). But finally the service!  Each time I'm met with the same two servers, in the business this is called retention, and good retention at that. These two are splendid in that they smile, joke around, refill drinks and DON'T hover. If you perform this well I go well over 20% with ease.  Sure, this is a chain restaurant but I really enjoy coming here. And with all fairness, the food seems to be well in order (most times).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-franklin,,,,,

However, the service was absolutely terrible. I don't think I've ever been treated so badly before. And not just me, I was with my family. We were kind and polite. We had to ask several times for utensils! UTENSILS! Come on. Those need to be there either when we get there or the hostess should put those out with our menus. Then the server came and he didn't even introduce himself or ask how we were or just wasn't even polite. I don't have to have a server who smiles constantly but a tiny smile would've been real nice. We got our drinks without ice. Told him about it and nothing ever happened. Took a while for the food but at least it wasn't terrible. Either the server didn't know how to communicate or he was just being rude. He was perfectly fine with the table behind us so I don't know what his deal was. We went on a Friday night and they were pretty slow. Overall, it was just terrible. If I go back there and I get him as my server again, I WILL walk out. That's how bad it was. Safe to say he did Not get a nice tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-franklin?start=20,,,,,

The service was average at best. We ordered, she brought drinks, then the food and then the bill. Those were the only 3 times we saw her. The food was beyond bad! We ordered a couole of apps and split a meal. The pot stickers were soggy and rubbery. The fries were cold and were sent back. The broccolli was also cold, and mushy.

10,Gabriel B.,"Franklin, TN",0,17,2.0,2.0,2017-02-03,I used to love going here as a kid. But it's kinda went down in the stocks. They change their menu a lot and get rid of some pretty good items. So I came back for the first time in like a solid 3 months and it was completely different. The best part was that their mozzarella sticks were much better. But I tried some new stuff that they had. My mom got a jack daniels chicken and shrimp meal and my dad got a chicken Caesar salad. It took them atleast 30 mins to get it out. And they got both me and my mother's meal wrong the first time. And my dad's salad came out last out of all the meals. Usually a salad is the first thing to come out first at any restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-franklin,,,,,

2,John C.,"Littleton, CO",0,1,,2.0,2017-06-30,"This location used to be really good, but today was just awful.  Service was indifferent, but it's Friday afternoon post-lunch so I'll leave that be and focus on the food. Mrs. C did the endless app thing, I stared at the menu another 10 minutes since everything under $20 I liked was no longer on it.  And the new lunch menu is the worst ever. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, ""green style"" as they call it, medium well (they asked) with a tomato mozzarella salad instead of fries. 10 minutes after that Mrs. C finally got her potato skins -- lots of cheese, minimal bacon, she rated them ""meh"". Seeing the pace so far, she immediately ordered meatballs for her next app.   20 minutes later I finally got a way overdone burger -- past well, almost to charcoal.  7 ounces? The ""green style"" was everything completely separate and disjointed.  AND it was cold. The tomato mozzarella salad?  Wrong. Seasoned fries instead.  I was out of time, so I had them take it away and off of my bill. So I got to leave hungry for $20. Thanks Friday's!  Fortunately, Chipotle wasn't busy -- the barbecoa bowl was way better than that burger would have been.
