I wasn't alone and the person I was with got the same treatment after also presenting valid unexpired matching ID.   PS: we were not intoxicated, but did drink the water in Maryland.....

Host returned a minute later, but did not clear the knife away when we pointed it out. It was a little unnerving.  This was 8 pm on a Sunday night. The place was dead. Maybe 5 customers total for the whole joint.  We explained to the host we wanted their BEST server. We are picky, but we tip well. They seated is across from the broken table of Pisa - a booth whose table had fallen over THE PREVIOUS WEEK & I guess they never got around to fixing it or removing it.  Beside the leaning/broken table was an empty table filled with uncleared dirty dishes from a past guest. That was never cleared off the whole time we were there.  TEN minutes later, we met our server. Nice girl, but if that was their BEST, that place is going out of business soon.  Forgot our straws. When appetizers came out, forgot our PLATES. Forgot our SILVERWARE. We Ordered Breadsticks. She forgot to bring BUTTER - Twice. Drink refills? What's that, you may ask. We had to ask 3xs.  Clear the table of dirty plates? Nope. Not once. We had to move our own dirty plates - onto the other table filled with dirty dishes.  We mentioned we were members of their Loyalty club (supposed to get a free appetizer) we didn't get squat.  Food came out with WET, cold French fries, tasteless mashed potatoes & over-cooked steak (medium rare was well done). The steak butter had melted and was, presumably the reason for the wet fries.  Manager, please. His trip to the table yielded us decent steak, fresh French fries & tasty mashed potatoes. That's it. Couldn't wait to get out of that dump.

And the first time our appetizer was brought out, it was the wrong order. She gave us a pathetic excuse that because we ordered at the same time our entrees were made quicker - total BS, in all the years we've done this at restaurants this has never happened - and since when should a burger be made quicker than chicken wings? Even worse, the fries and burger I received were merely warm, as were the loaded potato skins in the appetizer. Same with my wife's chicken tenders and fries. We were both so hungry and fed up by this point that we just ate it - waiting any longer who knows how long we'd be waiting around. So overall, this place offers extremely poor service - frankly that server was lucky she even got a 15% tip.

She had to ask a second time for the lemon.  2. I ordered onion soup as an appetizer which never showed up. The server did take it off the bill though.  3.

Even so, I lost the will to stay any longer for dessert, which was disappointing, because I was really looking forward to trying some.

I usually don't care for chain restaurants but this one is definitely a good one.  Their menu consists of mainly steak, chicken, and burgers. If you are into Jack Daniels, they have plenty of choices for you. I opted for a non-Jack Daniels flat iron steak the first time we came here and it was delicious! Cooked perfect with just the right amount of seasoning. Their rice is really the true gem. It is absolutely perfect. If you are not a rice fan, you will be after you try their rice. It is sweet and has little pieces of red pepper mixed throughout it. Yum!  Most recently I tried one of their sizzling entrees with chicken and it was also delicious. There's just something about your meal coming out on a sizzling hot pan that makes it all better. Under the three large pieces of chicken was a bed of red and green peppers and onions.

I was tired and ready to go, so I didn't think much about it... until this morning. Thankfully the bill was relatively small, but I have a serious problem with disingenuous billing and tipping practices. With a party larger than our party of two, they could make out with some serious cash with this scheme. I used to work in the food service industry so I know how it goes, but don't try to trick your customer into giving you what you didn't earn. I value honesty above all else, and when trust is broken, it's very difficult to be repaired.

8,Sara H.,"Lima, NY",11,6,,5.0,2017-07-06,"Great dinner after a long day of traveling.  The hostess greater was very friendly and showed us to our table without any waiting  The food was really good. Our server suggestions were spot on with a full rack of ribs for me and the husband and endless appetizer for my son. I ordered the strawberry daiquiri and was really happy with it, fresh strawberries made it so delicious.  Loved it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-frederick-3,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004
11,Amy D.,"York, PA",0,5,,5.0,2017-08-03,Was very pleased with the service and the food.

Highly recommend.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-frederick-3,3.52,3.52,3.52,,3.5200000000000005

1,Melissa J.,"Frederick, MD",0,2,,2.0,2017-12-07,I'm surprised our server even noticed us. She was too busy flirting with her coworker while we sat at a table for 15 minutes. Food was mediocre. Definitely made up for the lack of service. I used to love this place before moving. The reviews tell it all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-frederick-3,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002
7,Danii K.,"Myersville, MD",57,1,,1.0,2018-01-06,"For starters...we walk in and head over to sit at the bar. The whole left side of the bar was empty and EVERY single table was dirty. We sat at the lease dirty table and sat there for a good 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. And that's while there were 3-4 workers just standing there talking! 2 mangers came out and 1 said something to one of the girls about her being on her phone texting. They laughed it off and we still sat there. FINALLY someone cleaned the table. Then after waiting the longest out of people that came to the bar to eat we finally got asked what we would like to drink. Then I asked for chips and salsa and that took 10 minutes and when I got them I got a big bowl of salsa and a baby handful of chips. You beat I asked for more chips! Then our food finally came and we both got a side of mashed potatoes and for some reason the mashed potatoes came with cheese...we didn't know that. Nothing was mentioned about cheese in the mash on the menu. I'm vegan so I couldn't eat them! We finished and patiently waited for our check....(another 10 freakin minutes), while our server just stood by the bar laughing and having a good ol time. Needless to say this was a terrible experience! They weren't busy at all just terrible, neglectful serves and managers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-frederick-3,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002
