We recently went there to grab a bite to eat now that the baby is getting a bit easier to manage, but OMG this place has gone down hill for sure! We ordered the Jack Daniels glazed ribs which came out over nuked and under glazed . . . The margarita's that we ordered were indescribably bad, so we decided to replace the, with beer . . . Strike #3 came in the form of a soapy taste in my beer followed by stomach cramps that persisted through the night. Do not waste your hard earned money here . . .  I would drive a little bit to the west and go to Moore's Tavern . . . Or to the east and go to the Fireside Grill . . .

They had a picture on the menu and it looked a lot. But when the waiter gave me the dish, it was soooo little. On the picture, there was a lot of pieces of chicken, red peppers and artichokes like there was an even amount of chicken, etc. and pasta. But the one I had was really little. It was more pasta than anything else. I don't care for capers that much but if it was a light flavor, I would eat it. They seemed to get that right out of everything. TGI Fridays should either change their pictures on the menu or have the chefs make it the way it supposed to look. The waiter was ok. He did come by to check on us once and the food came out slow (and there was no one around).

Any time we go this TGI, we stand at the front desk for a while before anyone even shows up to seat us!!  Tonight was no different. We got out for an early dinner so the place was not busy. All the staff seemed to be having a nice converstion while we were satanding in the front for 10 minutes!! Finally, one of the waiters spotted us and went and get the girl to seat us. No apology or any acknowledgement of the fact that we were standing there!!  As for the food, my wife and my son are enamored with JAck Danilels chicken and shrimp. Me, I could live without it so I tried one of the newer items on the menu, Salmon with Langostinos. The taste was ok. Nothing to rite home about and the portion was tiny.

Not anymore though. Not after the great burger escape. Flashback: Three pals go into Fridays. Order two burgers and chicken fingers. Nothing really difficult. Not that hard to make. Instructions on the box type of deal. One burger comes out. Black. Asked for it medium. All good. Will endure. Tastes like charcoal crapped out charcoal in meat form. Fries taste like salt sticks. Heart attack by age 31. Second burger comes out. Cue 'great burger escape' theme. Two patties on this bertha of burgers. One of which hasn't reached full size yet. It's on the bottom. Add water to expand. Never added water. Reminds me of those sponges in the bath tub. Those were great. First patty is hanging on a 80 degree angle onto the plate. They missed. They missed the burger. Then they all decided to ""do it live"" and not fix it. It would've took 3 seconds.  Those 3 seconds were too valuable to TGI Fridays.  The burger patty stared at us. You know why they put it under a bun? So you don't have to see what you're eating. You don't want to see that. Well, we did. We stared at it for awhile. Waiting for it to move. It did a little bit. Cheese bubble. Popped. Looks delicious? No. Looks like dog toy.  Sorry Fridays. Uploading a picture for all the world to see the great burger escape. Because $60 for three people is pretty lame.

8,Mike I.,"Detroit, MI",36,168,35.0,3.0,2014-07-10,I think we all know what type of food we are going to be getting when we go to a place like TGI Fridays.  Depending on how much of a foodie you are will be how you rate a chain family restaurant.  With that in mind the things that I like to differentiate places that are chains is usually the service.  The service that I have always had at this Fridays is polite professional and helpful.  I was here on a weekday and sat down at the bar and was again met with friendly staff.  I'm sure everyone has their days but my experience has always been positive.   Another thing that I have noticed with TGI Fridays is depending on the time and day you go you can get whatever you want for a fairly low price per todays standards.  I ordered a Miller Lite 16oz and the Nachos Grande and my bill without tip was $7.00.  Everything was half price off at the time I was there.  I didn't believe my eyes.  TGI Fridays at certain times can be cheaper than fast food and barely more when including the tip.  Assuming you have good tipping practices!  Stop in if you want friendly service and you won't overpay for it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-freehold?start=20,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002

The soso: the Thai pork tacos were more Korean than Thai. The fries were OK but the oil in which they were fried was odd. Not stale or rancid. But odd.  The bad:  the chicken Cesar salad dressing is a vinaigrette. Cheap wooden plates to serve sloppy burger so the grease is every where.

Shouldn't they be working.  We ordered jack Daniels app which is a chicken dish. My husband bit into one and it was a shrimp. good thing I did not get that one or I would have went into shock since I am allergic. Really shrimp in a chicken dish... They seriously (I am not kidding ) could have killed me. To be on the safe side I ran to the car and took a benedryl.  We spoke to the manager who replied ""that's odd"". Ok how about a little caring reply, again since I could have went into shock. He was all laid back about it.... What a jerk especially caused my throat still feels like it is closing up a little.  When the two app's arrived to begin with we asked the food runner for side plates and napkins...... Never got them. We had to track down another server for them. By this time our buffalo wings were cold.  We had the jack Daniels chicken sandwich which was yummy. I would definitely have that again  Our server was nice but he left all our Dirty plates on the table and never cleaned them. When we left they were, again, a ton of employees at the host desk chatting away. At other restaurants , including other Friday's , they open the doors for you. But not here.

We were the only people sat at the tables in the bar room but there were 4 people at the bar. 2 guys and another couple. Right as soon as we entered the room the 2 guys started yelling. Like literally screaming. The bartender was laughing with them. My server told me they're regulars and do this every weekend but nothing more. As the meal went on their conversations got louder and more graphic. Talking about sex and showing each other nude pictures of their girlfriends, yelling about each other's moms. All about 10 feet from my table with my boyfriend. The bartender kept telling them to stop but in that ""ha ha you guys are crazy"" kind of way. They started to threaten to whip out their penises and the bartender kept laughing and telling them to stop. Then They did! These two guys took out their penises at the tgi Friday's bar and asked the bartender if she wanted to see them hard. She laughed and told them if they don't stop she really will kick them out. Idk how things work over there but I work at another restaurant in the area and if someone even got 1/10th as drunk as those guys, theyd be out. She never kicked them out after they whipped their privates out. They stayed and continued their disgusting and loud conversation.

48,Kim F.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,7,,1.0,2015-11-01,"Food is fine.  Exactly what I expected from Fridays.  Service is horrific.  We used to come in on Sundays to watch football and couldn't find a seat. We hadn't been there in a while so decided to go in.  We sat at the bar and there were only a few people there.  After waiting 5 minutes the bartender  Markisha finally acknowledged us and took our drink order.  A couple minutes later another bartender Jennette came over and asked again.  Finally we got drinks. We then listened to Jeanette talk about how hung over she is and can't wait to get out of there.  There were a couple  of other inappropriate conversations we overheard as well.  Then we waited 10 minutes to order food. Not because they weren't paying attention but because they weren't there Customers walked in, sat down, and walked out because there was no bartender. One would return for a few minutes and then they would disappear again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-freehold,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003

15,Pat P.,"Freehold Township, NJ",0,8,,1.0,2016-05-27,"Ignorance Poor Management/Service walked out. It had been a long time since coming back to this place (a result of poor service / so so food). So last night at 930 after a long day at work exercise while bringing my son home from soccer practice we decided to give them another try.  Place was empty and the Yankees were on so I asked hostess if we could sit in the bar area. He Happily sat us in a booth within the bar area.  Waited 10 minutes and waitress told me that they can't have children at bar after 9 and offered to sit us outside of this area. Really. Wanted a nice meal glass of wine and to watch ball game with my son and was in a booth not at the bar which I would clearly understand. Imagine if they said that atMoore, Chapter House, Cabin....... No wonder the place was empty. Very poor business sense and I didn't want to sit in an empty restaurant area left with out ordering pissed again at this place.  This is my first negative comment on Yelp but it still pisses me off.  Now I won't go back as there are so many better more accommodating places in the area and will make same recommendation to friend.

The apps we chose were hit and miss. Boneless chicken wings were OK, the mozerella (sp?) were very good. The other three apps were bland. On this visit, we had the worst waiter we'ver EVER had at any restaraunt. This guy (Eric) should seriously consider a career path that doesn't require interacting with, you know, people. Slow service, no personallity, and it seemed he really didn't want to be there.  Based on our experience, and the majority of other one star reviews, this'll be the last trip to this particular Friday's.  We left the place at about 4:45 PM, and the parking lot was pretty much deserted...now I know why.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-freehold,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92

Greeted by several hosts? I was asked three times by three different people if we were a party of two. Sat us at a two top - saw available booths, but I let it go. Was pretty cold in there too which made me extra anxious to wrap this meal up and go as quickly as possible. Burger was kinda pink- requested medium well.... Onion bacon jam is just some sautéed onions and old bacon. I left it untouched on my plate. Fries were salty. Like really salty.  The sirloin was decent.  Whiskey cake seemed dry. Kinda reminded me of a spice cake covered in a sauce. Unimpressive. All in all a disappointing meal. My waitress, was attentive and accommodating, as were all the members of the staff I encountered.

35,SuzAnne S.,"Howell, NJ",195,447,179.0,1.0,2017-03-25,"Came here today for a late lunch early dinner after a long day at a car dealership, O we were hungry and thought hey $10.00 endless apps why not... so we schlepped our tired butts over in the rain to T.G.I.F. Surprise!! endless apps are not just $10.00 pp- yep there is an up- charge of $1. and odd change when you ask for a refill of said appetizers. I couldn't find this in the small print or online but per our server this was the case, so YES it's 10.00 per person, but with an up-charge-- we passed. I can say, our server was really nice and attentive, but it was downhill from there and I blame the kitchen, because the restaurant and bar was not packed- at all. What we did order:  Green Bean Fries with Cucumber-Wasabi Dipping Sauce- Large enough to share and a real sleeper and by that I mean-they didn't sound appealing at all, but Mini-Me wanted them AND they were good!! the dipping sauce- YUM!! we asked for extra. Spinach & Queso Dip- Gross. Glob of what??  Came out lukewarm at best. The best that we three could tell, is it looked like the kitchen just plopped a cold spinach ball in the center of the little serving dish, kind of mashed it down and poured the ""warm queso""  mixture on top w/ breadcrumbs, it wasn't even toasted. It was sooo lukewarm that I was able to hold the bowl in my hand- while I stirred the cheese and spinach to blend, and even then, as you can see from the pics-- that spinach is mighty green and spinachy. We ate some of the cheesy mix around the spinach because we were hungry, but it was already cold because the spinach was cold.  Dinner Side Salad- Came with my entree- it's salad. Entree- Hubby had the bacon cheeseburger- according to him it was -""just okay""-it was really pink in the middle more on the rare side and limp old bacon-eww. Mini-Me had the 1/2 rack of Jack Daniels ribs- they were dry and fries were super salty so- for a kid that loves her fries- she couldn't eat them. I ordered the French Dip which came with fries. The meat was really dry and jerky-ish, the bread was hard, even the onion dipping Au Jus couldn't save it because it was totally flavorless. There was very little meat, the cheese was dry and in the photo I attached I just opened up the sandwich and snapped the photo. Yes I ate the first 1/2 because I was hungry but left the second portion, I simply couldn't stomach it. 1 strawberry lemonade, 1 peach ice tea and 1 reg ice tea--  total for lunch $80.00+ change. We paid our bill and when we got into the car, my hubby and Mini-Me said - well, that was terrible. Now what I can say is our server was super nice but that really can't make up for the lousy food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-freehold,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96
43,John D.,"Belmar, NJ",53,37,6.0,1.0,2017-04-25,"I used to love going to friday's... now, i'd rather go anywhere else. The energy of the place is about as exciting as eating food in a morgue. We ordered a steak which was so small, you could have ordered a burger that was bigger. To compliment that, it was charred on the edges so the only edible part was the middle, thus making the portion size that much smaller. My friend ordered sliders, that looked like one burger cut in 3 to make white castle burgers ( also burnt ) Then there comes my veggie avocado burger . The last words I remember hearing were... "" you still want the avocado right?"" which you'd think when saying yes, was definitive in it's being. Nope. No avocado on it even though I said yes. To make it even better, the fork which was taken from my plate after i finished my salad, was never replaced, so i ate my veggie burger and mashed potatoes with my steak knife. One would normally say, John, why didn't you just ask her for another? To which I would answer "" why, yes, I would "" but alas, she was nowhere to be found and didn't check up on us til we were practically finished. This is another restaurant that raises the cost of food, while making the mediocre food at best, while simultaneously making their portions so small you wonder what the hell you're paying for.

The fried were a tad undercooked. I could've got a better burger at Wendy's and paid less money!

There were so many tables empty and I had requested a table for 2 but was told that there was a 30 minute wait.  Therefore, I sat at the bar. Furthermore, the service time took so long. I ordered sizzling chicken and shrimp and they forgot the shrimp. All that was ordered was two cokes, nachos and the sizzling chicken and shrimp and it took over one hour for service. The person who was working at the bar had too much on his plate and it took a long time for everything. It was incredibly underwhelming and frustrating to have such bad service. Furthermore, it was a Saturday night but the place was empty. The food was not great tasting either. I would never go back there again. It was pathetic service and I was incredibly annoyed by it. TGIF is supposed to a be a sports bar but it did not even have the proper sports TV channels.
