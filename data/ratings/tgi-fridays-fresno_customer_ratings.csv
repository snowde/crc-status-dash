After seeing all their great specials on the TV i decided that would be a fun place for a birthday dinner. NOPE. The wait time was changed several times, the host was apologetic, thats fine, he can't control that. Our server was like a carbon copy of Seth from Superbad. and he was a super bad server. No personality, no idea how to interact with human beings. The portions were minuscule compared to the price.

I will never ever choose to eat at tgif  again the quality of the meal is no longer what it use to be the portions no longer justify the price. You can completely tell that the manager is cutting corners as quality of food is definitely not what they were serving I got the sizzling chicken and shrimp and the chicken came out like jerky its no longer a breast of chicken but thinly sliced over cooked chicken served with shrimp cover with spaghetti sauce.

Weekend dinner to late night can be pretty busy so make sure you come early and get a table. It can be a hefty wait time. If you come during late night, don't expect it to be quiet and relaxing. A lot of groups, including my own, can get really loud.  Staff is okay. They get the job done.  Food is so-so. You can't expect much from these chain restaurants but if you have a great crowd, the food won't be such a big deal. However, they have a great happy hour!

Came in sometime between 2 and 3 pm on a week day.  Was seated quickly and served quickly also.  Since I was not really hungry, I just ordered my all-time favorite food from TGIFs. I ordered the Loaded Potato Skins appetizer!  TGIF is where I first discovered this treat, and nobody does it better than TGIF.  Something about those potatoes loaded with melted cheese, bacon bits, sour cream, and green onions just tastes so very very good.  They just do not taste the same buying them from the frozen food section at the grocery store.

My boyfriend and I got here a little after midnight on a Friday night and we were seated immediately. The first thing a I didn't like was that they had my chair on an uneven level of ground and the chair was wobbling. I nearly fell when I sat down... Very unsafe. Strike one. We had to wait 20 minutes for the people behind us to leave so we could push our table and my chair back. Next thing, they bring out my bf's Sprite and there's a brown object (small rock?) in the cup. Ew. Strike two. The waitress gladly brought out another drink. It took a really long time for our food to come out like 45+ mins... No apology about the wait! Strike three! I ordered the Jack Daniels chicken with a baked potato. The waitress never asked if I wanted fixings on my potato! Ugh so when they bring it out it is literally a DRY potato with nothing on it but green onions. I had to ask the chef (whoever brought out our food; wasnt the waitress) to bring my fixings- bacon, cheese, butter, sour cream.... He brings everything except the bacon and I never got it. Baked potato issue strike four.  I dig into my chicken and it is unusually tough to cut but I take a bite anyway and quickly regretted it & had to spit it out. The chicken was rubbery and tough! Ugh strike five!! My bf ordered the same thing so I taste his chicken and it is moist and cooked correctly. Mine wasn't. I tell the waitress and she offers to have the kitchen redo it but we were in a rush to leave so she just takes the charge off our bill. I feel like they should have done more than that though... One mistake? Fine. Two? Okay its a busy night. But FIVE issues is excessive and unacceptable. Pretty pissed about this horrible experience.

You have no room to be stuck up to anyone and deffenetly no need to be stuck up to paying customers! Your a pathetic excuse for a hostess. Anyways to the thing they call food here.. The food absolutly sucks!! Tried the new burger the other day ""smoke stacked burger"" with sausage and bacon and two pattys. Well what a absolute joke that burger was!!!! A piece of bacon broken in half with ONE!!!!! little peice of sausage the size of a penny!! Then I get a shit small portion for fries!! I asked my waitress what the deal was with my fries and she said they weigh the fries now and give you nothing for fucking 13 dollars!!! The waitress agreed with me and said she can't believe the little amount of portions you get... I have had the French dip before that was absolutly disgusting!! The Au Jus sauce was so salty it ruined the sandwich with the stuff they called meat. The Potato skins are disgusting!! The wait time here is a absolute joke!!!! 40 mins to get my hamburger the other day. My waitress was so unhappy that she said she is looking for a new job because of ""exact words"" of how fucked up the management is here! No communication with her managers that hide in the back all day long.. You can see some tall balled headed dorky fucker walking around with his thumb up his ass not doing shit. And while I was there he was pissing off a family at another table I was next too when he ignored them when they had a complaint!! They were so furious at him that I'm surprised not to see a complaint on here about it. Later I found out that was the manager through my waitress... You sir are a disgrace!!! How your a manager of this dump surprises me!! Ignoring paying customers is pathetic!! Making them pay for the garbage you call food is a outrage!! This place is a absolute joke!! I can't even discribe how unhappy I have been coming here. I have been here now 3 times in the past 2 months trying to give this place a shot and a second chance but this was the last time!!!

34,Umar R.,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",876,622,7492.0,4.0,2015-07-13,"Happy hours after 9 till closing on weekdays with 1/2 price appetizers and under $7 drinks, what's not to love about going to TGI Fridays for that. Also their bar service was excellent. Im not so sure about the main dishes here, but their appetizers is the bomb and delicious. I also do love the interior, very classical looking American bar and restaurant  with great wood work and also stained glasses at their ceiling lights. Parking here is really easy after 9, with pretty of FREE private parking lot.  For appetizers my sister and I ordered the 1/2 price after hours special for $5 loaded skin potatoes and ultimate nachos. The loaded skin potatoes was crispy on the skins and was nice and soft on the inside, had an amazing savory taste that brings party to my mouth, dipped in the sour cream, can someone say hallelujah;  there was probably 10 of them which is a lot for just $5. Also the nachos was just so big  and generous in serving, everything from the guacamole, to the sour cream and side salad tasted fresh, while the nachos was crisped and generously drizzled with melted cheese, jalapeños and grilled chicken. Whats a perfect balance of taste for appetizers.  The drinks was good but not the best, I still preferred the margaritas from chili's. I ordered the ultimate margarita $6 and my sister order the tropical sunset for $4, both drinks were perfectly made. I would have preferred my margarita to have a stronger lime juice taste, but can't complain because the triple-sec was a generous amount, which almost got me tipsy with just one drink. It was served in the 20oz glass. I would also had loved my margarita to be served in a margarita glass though, but that's ok , still had a good time.  Overall excellent happy hour with 1/2 of appetizers and great drink prices.

I did not like the location of it but enough parking space. We got there by 8 pm-was told there was a 40-45 min wait; we were the only group there of 9 ppl. Upon observing the restaurant it is a fairly small space and the layout is an L Shape since the entrance is at a corner. Bar area is decent I like the bar stools enough Flat screens around the bar area. Bartenders were friendly and nice! Since we had a lot of ppl I'm going to rate only the dishes I had and tried only.  Appetizers: Boneless buffalo wings, quesadilla, potstickers, flatbread, queso chip dip and a trio platter. BBW: 4/5 I like the buffalo sauce and they did not over do the sauce-it was great!!  Quesadilla: 4/5 I believe it was Chicken--I really liked it! Great taste!  Potstickers: 5/5 my favorite!!! I'm a potsticker fan so I'm very judgmental but I would have to say I really liked these potstickers and the dipping  sauce!!! One thing is that these potstickers are maybe large sized so it would probably take two or three bites to finish one.  Entrees: Lobster and Steak; Full rack of ribs Lobster and Steak: 4.5/5 I really enjoyed my entree!! My sides were Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes! Like I mention earlier I'm a really picky person when it comes to certain food items. I fell in love with their mashed potatoes (5/5)!! As for their Mac and Cheese it didn't really taste like Mac and Cheese---Penne Pasta was used so I felt that it tasted like a pasta dish I feel that if they had make this particular dish into an entree it would really sell good because it tasted really good 4/5!! I had the option of grilling or steaming my lobster I choose grill it wasn't that bad. I had a 6oz steak medium rare! Ohh my--the cook did a great job bc it was perfect; the seasoning too!  Full Ribs Entree: 2.5/5 per my fiancé he did not like the BBQ sauce they put on the ribs. He is also a coleslaw lover and the did not like theirs.  Overall great first time experience!!!

We decided on TGIFs due to it being our spot since we were in our early 20s. We got there around 7pm and the parking lot did not appear to be crowded but when we entered the place was packed! We requested to sit outside since there was one table of people outside and it was quite noisy. The host informed us that the only reason they came seat us outside is due to someone requested special service to have their dog outside with them. I still didn't see why we couldn't be seated outside so we are seated in a booth and the host ask us if we wanted a booster for my niece. We declined since she is big enough to eat at the table now without any accommodations. However the host kept asking us and we just said yes since he wants my niece to have a booster seat so bad. So we get the booster and she barely fits because she really didn't need it. We order our drinks and a beverage for the niece and we did not have our food ready due to catching up with one another. So we finally settled on the appetizer of nachos and they were delicious. A family friend decided to join us as well and we waited until he arrived. By then a large elderly group sat next to us and thought my niece was a doll! They made her shy due to all the wonderful interactions they were giving her! One of them even ticked my niece! Gotta love strangers! Anyways while waiting me order another appetizer which is the BBQ chicken flat bread and mind you each appetizer takes forever! The service of hosts is great but the food service is slow and could improve! Anyways our finally friend arrives and we order two more appetizers since they are half off on Sundays all day! My phone died at that time so I didn't get to photograph the food like I wanted but we also ordered cheese burger sliders and chicken quesadillas and man I was so stuffed by then!

Sadly, that is also a problem because there isn't a great deal of variety. However, it does seem as though their food was a little more greasy than normal this last time we were there. I had the Parmesan crusted chicken, and I noticed that there was a slight pool of oil at the bottom of my plate, but this might be because of the cheese. I'll admit the flavor is still there and has not changed, which left me with a satisfied feeling, but the overall ""vibe"" left me a with a slightly off feeling. I want to try it out one more time, because maybe they were having an off day... but overall, my experience wasn't as stellar as I had hoped!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fresno,2.92,3.24,3.24,,3.1120000000000005

26,Tammy A.,"Sanger, CA",13,1,,1.0,2017-10-27,"WORST EXPERIENCE!!!! HORRIBLE!!!  Took almost an hour and being transferred 6 times, just to get someone to take my order. I ordered  4 rib specials at 12.99 each,  they tell me the bill was 106.00! I said that is not possible, it should be around 52 plus tax. She tells me that is the correct price. SERIOUSLY! That is basic math! The order total was over double that. They transfer me to another girl, who says maybe it's that much because of drinks. I DIDN'T ORDER DRINKS! It was a to go order, no drinks. I finally speak to the manager. He redoes the total, it comes out around 52 something. Okay, now to get the food. It's been an hour of frustration, but I'm assured the manager is personally making sure my order is right. I pay the bill, get all the way home and half the sides are missing!!! WTH!!! Call AGAIN,  manager says he will take off one meal because of all the problems.  At this point that meal should have been free, but ok I just want this mess over with. So now he charges my card AGAIN and says the more expensive charge will come off in 3 to 5 business days! SERIOUSLY!!! I WILL NEVER EVER EAT AT TGIF AGAIN, I WILL TELL EVERYONE I KNOW WHAT A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE THIS WAS!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fresno?start=20,2.96,3.23,3.23,,3.122

10,Marcy B.,"Clovis, CA",6,42,14.0,1.0,2017-11-09,"Let me begin by saying I try very hard to not patronize chain restaurants.  I feel it is really important to support local businesses.  However, on occasion, I end up at a ""chain"" due to location, or because of my friend's choice.  Anyway... today I was in a work training and had exactly one hour for lunch.  We were one block from Friday's, so we thought it was a good choice.  We called first to see if we could place our order so it would be ready when we arrived.  They said no, but not to worry... the lunch service is very quick.  Ok, sounds good. When we arrived we were happy to see that the restaurant was EMPTY.  This gave us hope that we would have plenty of time to enjoy our lunch and be back to our training in plenty of time. We were sadly mistaken.  I'm pretty sure that there was only one waitress working.  She was very nice, but we had to literally flag her down to take our order and then again to bring our check.  It was over 40 minutes to receive a ""lackluster"" salad and a turkey sandwich.  I think we figured out why the restaurant was a ghost town.  Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fresno,2.96,3.26,3.26,,3.14
4,Mary Lou S.,"Fresno, CA",13,68,47.0,5.0,2017-12-11,"It was late for lunch and early for dinner when I stopped in on a Monday. 4PM is a good time for a bargain at TGI Fridays.  I got an appetizer for half price (happy hour) and a steak and lobster dinner for $14.99. All that plus undivided attention as it was super slow at the time! The potato skins were just as good as I remembered them from long ago. (Oh, and that yummy sour cream you get with them? It's a mixture of sour cream AND ranch!). The lobster was small, but it was tasty and took care of the craving. My steak was flavorful and cooked to a perfect medium rare. You also get two sides with your dinner. They have a good baked potato, but I didn't care for the coleslaw which I chose in place of the broccoli. (Green stuff? Yuck!).  Anyway, if you get away from work early one day, try the specials here. And if you drink alcohol , it IS happy hour then!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fresno,3.04,3.28,3.28,,3.1840000000000006
