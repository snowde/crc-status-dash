11,David R.,"Gainesville, FL",75,1,,1.0,2017-06-01,"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE. Beautiful restaurant with okay food (whenever you get your food). If your going for endless apps DONT, you'll end up waiting 20 minutes a plate and when you do get you order there will be something wrong with it, and if you bring it to a managers attention they will publicly bash the staff in front of EVERYONE as if working for them is some sort of honor. Which brings me to my next point, its such a shame such a beautiful NEW restaurant is being run by such rude and dishonest management! I personally know that over 15 employees have quit in the last 4 months alone and yet nothing has been done about the terrible people running this business. They treat their host staff like slaves, they make an example of their employees to guests just for making a common mistake, and are extremely unappreciative of their employees effots! I didn't get the memo, when did being a manager/asst manager at a bar and grill become grounds for thinking your some big shot? It's such a shame because the floor staff is great (food is okay) but with all the corruption within management Friday's has lost a customer for life.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gainesville-2,,,,,
10,Nicolas D.,"Gainesville, FL",190,2,,1.0,2017-06-10,"STAY AWAY !  Simply put, management is horrible and incompetent, service is terrible, and worst of all the food is atrocious and finally kitchen staff does not know what they are doing. This is a real shame as I have been to other restaurants of the same caliber and I HAVE NOT HAD SUCH TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.      I will start with the general manager. She is incompetent, uneducated, and perhaps worse of all she does not have any manners. Then again, I supposed this is to be expected of an individual ""managing"" a third class restaurant. I highly suggest she begins to read books on the topic of business management.  From what I understand, she went to school for accounting at USF, but from my interaction with her I am willing to bet she never finished college, after all why would an accountant work at TGIF?  beats me. Secondly, as I previously mentioned the service here is plain terrible. It is my believe  the fault is not on the food servers as the kitchen is always, at least apparently, understaffed. This leads me to believe the management does not seem to hire reliable people. Again, proving my point on the incompetence of the management. The kitchen staff seems to not value food presentation, plates are always smeared and/or cross-contaminated with things other than what I ordered. Also, do not bother ordering liquor here as they will short you to make more money off of you. General manager is unhappy, delusional, and will never accomplish anything in life, other than being a manager of a third class restaurant. I truly feel bad for her.   I rate this restaurant ONE STAR.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gainesville-2,,,,,
9,Neale B.,"Gainesville, FL",0,7,,1.0,2017-08-11,"Cannot remember a time when a ""hostess"" and a waitress made me feel more unwelcome and uncomfortable than I did at the Gainesville Florida location. Food was good and service satisfactory",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gainesville-2,,,,,
7,Jenn C.,"Gainesville, FL",20,37,53.0,1.0,2017-08-16,"I had placed a call ahead for a table of 8 for a birthday party. When we arrived I told the hostess to let the waiter know its my daughters birthday. Dillon came to take our order and had no idea it was her birthday. Dillon seemed to be very lost he took orders from all over the place rather then going around the table person to person, as he started to walk away my son says excuse me I havent ordered yet. So I had the feeling Dillon was new or not used to a large table.  After an hour our food came out However, my order was wrong. I asked for jack daniels chicken and shrimp and was given chicken and ribs. Dillon took my plate back and returned with hot shrimp and cold chicken. I asked for a manager and told him to take the plate back it was cold and not everyone was finishing up he offered me a discount and a free desert. I said im done just take the chicken off my bill. My daughter came into town for three days to celebrate her birthday and this was the birthday dinner we gave her. I am heart broken.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gainesville-2,,,,,
6,Scott C.,"Minneapolis, MN",2,5,,1.0,2017-08-18,We went here for my daughters 19 th birthday dinner. We called ahead for a party of 8 so we would make sure we had a table. We told the hostess and the waiter that it was a surprise and a birthday. When we arrived. They could care less about the birthday girl. Took 10 minutes or more to get a drink from the bar. There was only about 20 tables. So we know it was not to busy for them waiter was terrible. Food took forever. 35 minutes for a burger. Wife ordered chicken and shrimp. They brought chicken and ribs. Sent it back. Came back out 7 min later and the chicken was cold. Sent it Val know and said don't bother. She ate some of mine. Managers solution was to give the birthday girl free cake. LOL! They do that anyway for a birthday. Don't go there. It's not worth it. Plenty of other good restaurants to choose from.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gainesville-2,,,,,
2,Fernando G.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,10,,1.0,2017-08-27,"I must agree with a lot of the other reviews do not waste your money here!! The food here is average I am not going to say better or worse than other places, The biggest problem I would say this restaurant has is that only one person may eat at a time due to the fact that they bring plates out about 15 minutes apart do not bother ordering the endless appetizers due to the fact that the waiter will bring the first ones and disappear for about an hour .   On the bright side the restaurant seem to have a good atmosphere there were lots of employees in there seemingly just wondering around looked very clean just took a long time to get everything that is the only reason they have a one star for this review that and they do not give you the option to do zero stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gainesville-2,,,,,
1,Christina E.,"Gainesville, FL",2,34,132.0,1.0,2017-10-10,"After a 45 minute wait to be seated, which I expected on a Friday night a 7pm, I really can't explain how sad I was with my experience and the unresponsiveness of the management as I tried to explain we waited an hour and a 15 min for the first round of endless apps to come to the table (3 of the 5 of us ordered this.)  He literally just stared at me with no expression on his face, good or bad it was crazy, and said nothing. Mind you, I worked in the service industry and have family in the field so we can put up with a lot. I was genuinely polite whit this man, as you catch more flies with honey. Really, I just wanted him to acknowledge the issues and apologize and maybe even if a ""typical"" explanation, but he just said nothing.   By the time this manager was running our first round of endless apps, which was incorrect by the way, my hubby and bro-in-law had already finished their burgers that came out ahead of the rest of the table. We sat a high top right beside the bar and had to watch multiple guests seated there get 3 to 4 rounds of endless apps before ours ever even arrived and watch the guys eat their burgers.   I need to say that my hubby and I fell in LOVE with our local TGI Friday's in Pittsburgh at the Waterfront. Also, highly enjoyed the airport location as well. When moved here of course this was one of the first places we went to eat. The old G-ville location was good, but ever since it moved to the new Butler Plaza and became ""Fridays"" is has been just awful (many friends and neighbors have said the same thing.)  I will say I could tell the our server was BEYOND stressed and the place seemed understaffed with the amount of busing tables and running food being done by management. However, when I got up to go to the bathroom and scope out the restaurant, there were many empty tables that had not been cleared, so I really had no Idea why the food was taking so long because our section was totally empty by this point and they weren't even seating in there any more.  Anyways, back to the food a the end of the night, so they quickly brought out the second round of apps and disappeared. I would like to point out that when we first sat down (of course after waiting almost 15 min for the server to arrive) and ordered the first round, the server suggested we give her the second round so she would be able to put it in immediately after the first round. So AGAIN it's insane that we waited so long.  To be honest the food was lukewarm, if that. Not to mention, the PRICE of the endless apps has been raised from $10 to $12 and the first serving portion has been made smaller. Originally for $10 you started with 6 potatoes skins then if you ordered that again it would be 4 skins, actually all the rounds after your first would be smaller than the first, but that is beside the point. NOW we started with 4 and the next round was also 4. So for $12, I got 4 sad potato skins and 4 tired pieces of flatbread. Not worth the money. It's really only worth it if you can do 3 rounds and by the time 9:10 pm rolled around and the apps were lame, it was time to go. We'd been there over  2 hrs, way too long for a corporate restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gainesville-2,,,,,
3,Jen G.,"Gainesville, FL",25,99,116.0,4.0,2017-11-11,"Thank you TGIF's for supporting us veterans today. The food was amazing as well as the service. The special was 1/2 ribs or entree $12 and under. I used this opportunity to try something new, the pecan crusted chicken salad. My kids even liked it. The place is clean and we enjoyed sitting outside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gainesville-2,,,,,
8,Sarah B.,"Gainesville, FL",0,9,,2.0,2017-12-04,"Friend made a reservation for 12 people the night before we were planning to go. It was a Saturday night so we expected it to be busy but thought we'd be fine with the reservation. We waited 30 min from our reservation to be seated. When we finally got seated, the waitress had told us it was two TABLES right next to each other. They were actually booths and we couldn't even talk to the other half of the party. And 6 people at each of those there wasn't anywhere to put elbows or plates for all of us. No way we could have eaten there. I thought it was ridiculous so I went and found the manager. There was a 10 top that just needed to be cleaned and we could move. I explained the situation to him and asked him if we could have the table cleaned and move there. He sort of hesitantly agreed and got it done. We moved and just added two chairs to the end and all had a great time chatting and having fun after. Would have been a much better experience had we been sat in a table big enough for all of us in the first place. The food was mediocre. I liked the Mac n cheese and mashed potatoes. My chicken was meh.  The only good thing about the night was the waitress Theresa. She was AWESOME!! Super sweet and still waited on us even after we moved out of her section. She also constantly checked to see if we needed anything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gainesville-2,,,,,
5,Vickie S.,"Duluth, MN",0,2,,2.0,2017-12-07,"Had the Mediterranean shrimp on naan bread, bread was BURNT (top & Bottom) also needed to put my glasses on to see if any shrimp was in there.  Also the Long Island tea, yuck, tasted like a lemon, limey drink,  reminded me more of a margarita.  Bad cook, bad bartender.  But on a good note my husbands burger was very good.  On a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a 2.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gainesville-2,,,,,
0,Joe S.,"Gainesville, FL",6,2,,2.0,2017-12-30,"I've been here a number of times. The food and the service are hit or miss. I've experienced more misses at this location though. My last experience was ridiculous. After verifying that we were rewards members our server said he she would put in for our free chips and salsa. They apparently went to Mexico for this because it didn't show up to our table until mid meal and apparently it was snowing in Mexico because the salsa was a slushie. I FINALLY saw our server again and told her about it. No apology and only offered to have it heated up since they don't have salsa that is normal temperature. She arrived 10 mins later with piping hot microwaved salsa. My girlfriend and I looked at each other and looked back down at the burned ring around the rim of the salsa cup and began to laugh and shake our heads. But since it's free, I digressed.  I got endless apps and my girlfriend's full rack of ribs with two sides were served 20 mins before my first app even came out. At this point I was going to say something but our server was no where to be seen! Young staff. Food was grocery store grade. Service was terrible. Chalk another one up to a bad experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gainesville-2,,,,,
4,Any H.,"Gainesville, FL",352,22,45.0,2.0,2018-01-07,"I don't even know where to begin. I don't think I've ever had a truly enjoyable experience at Friday's. Let me start with the unlimited apps offer. Not only did they raise the price from $10 to $15 but, they offer this ""deal"" and they make it so difficult for you to get the most of it. It took 30 min for the first appetizer to come out. Mind you, it's not even a full appetizer. It took longer than that to get an order of chips and salsa that we also ordered. The place wasn't busy at all so, I don't understand why it took that long for us to get our food. It took for us to have a stearn talking with the waiter for the service to get better and for them to bring out the food quicker. For the food to have taken so long to come out it wasn't great. Good, but not worth having to wait 30 min, in an almost empty restaurant. They need to do better. I never come here by choice but, when I do I'm ready to give them another chance and I'm disappointed every time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gainesville-2,,,,,
