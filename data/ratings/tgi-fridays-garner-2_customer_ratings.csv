48,Val P.,"Raleigh, NC",55,99,43.0,4.0,2012-12-06,Children eat free on Wednesday's. The service is always pretty good and quick. We know most of the servers and the hostesses by name. One server in particular (Charlie) is wonderful. Sometimes they bring out chips and salsa when you are seated. Sometimes they don't. Not sure why. Overall the kids like it and it makes them happy to see the guy who comes around and makes balloon figures.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-garner-2?start=40,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.16

26,Alison D.,"Garner, NC",94,138,21.0,2.0,2013-03-28,"Oh, how I lament the days of the old TGI Friday's, back when I was a kid and experienced Vanilla Coke before it was everywhere, the kind with the real vanilla syrup. But things change and TGIF has reincarnated itself several times over the years (I won't say how many) since I first ate at one as a 9 year old. The newest reincarnation does nothing for me. My husband and I visited on an impromptu date night when we needed to stay close to home and eat for cheap. We picked TGIF because they sent us coupons, and because sadly, in Garner there are really very few locally owned dinner options.  It was a meal. What can I say? The Red Oak on tap was skunky (a common problem with Red Oak as they don't preserve their kegs and the chains they are in don't promote their beer properly, so there is not enough turnover to keep the beer from turning sour) but our waitress changed it for a Sam Adams with no hesitation. The service was actually probably the best thing about this place. Our waitress was about 14 months pregnant and seemed worn out, but she was an excellent waitress nonetheless. The food was OK. I got a burger. It was a burger. I think I asked if they could cook it closer to medium (menu says medium well or well) and it was pretty much charred. But I still ate it, and didn't complain. I don't remember what my husband got, so apparently it was neither memorable or offensive. Bottom line: it's close, and they send coupons, so we may eat there again, but I would certainly rather support locally owned businesses or the Logan's right next door that has a terrific management team than just eat at another everyday chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-garner-2?start=20,1.8,1.8,1.8,1.8,1.8000000000000003

Our waitress arrived immediately. She provided great service! I got the Jack Daniels Grilled Chicken sandwich. It was amazing. The grilled chicken was very tender and flavorful. Way better than expected. The bun was warm and toasted. It came with a Jack Daniels dipping sauce. If was very sweet and very good. I would have ordered a whole bottle of the sauce!  Also I thought it was great the waitress brought out extra napkins and wet wipes. Let face it. You always need extra napkins and who doesn't love a wet wipe! After the sauce I needed it!

19,Becky F.,"Garner, NC",211,408,338.0,2.0,2014-10-08,"The food here is really bad.  I had to get that out first in case you are sitting in the parking lot thinking of going in and just brushing through the Reviews.   Now the longer version... We've lived in the area near White Oak Shopping Center where this place is for 5 years, and since it is right outside the White Oak Movie Theater and we wanted dinner after a movie, we figured it was time to give it a try.   The atmosphere is nice (TGIFriday Style) and the service was good, and I can say that the Wedge Salad was good, so it started out promising.  Normally we wouldn't come here for steaks, ribs, and lobster, but once we sat down and saw those tempting pictures in the Menu, we went for it.  Big Mistake!  My Rib Eye was mostly fat and gristle, and just didn't taste good.  My honey got the Jack Daniels Sirloin steak and wished he hadn't... the Jack Daniels sauce is just a sweet, sticky, glaze, and not very tasty.  The ribs just weren't good, we didn't eat them.  How can ribs not be good?  They were a little crispy, dry, and not much sauce.  And they just didn't taste right.   I had a side of Lobster tail... I took one bite and it made me make a face!  I mean, like, YUCK!  I almost spit it out.  I tried another taste later, hoping for better, but it was fishy and really nasty.  We both got broccoli on the side (served as huge awkward stalks) and Chris's was green, and mine was brownish!  Ick!  Additionally there was no butter or seasoning on it, so it was pretty inedible.  The Mashed Potatoes were okay. The Waiter took the ""lobster tail"" (a term I'll use loosely!) off the tab which was nice, and he was very understanding that I didn't like it, in such a way that he knows more about how things are handled in the kitchen than he wanted to tell!  Never again will I enter those doors.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-garner-2,1.704,1.704,1.704,1.704,1.704

32,Aaron B.,"Raleigh, NC",171,130,58.0,3.0,2014-12-23,"This visit saw me on a first-meeting.  I won't call it a first date because I typically dislike that label on principle. My 'friend' and I were both hungry and wanted somewhere with a variety of choices and at convenient distance to us both.  So we chose the White Oak shopping center and picked TGI Friday's over Chili's.   Variety of food choices... well not so much.  It seemed the menu has gotten a chopping lately.  My go-to choice of a chicken marinara dish was now extinct as well as a few other items.  Stuck between sandwiches and more elaborate dinner fare we both made our choices and ordered.  Yup.  Both of us ordered burgers.  She got one of the new All-American Stacked Burger and I picked the Classic Cheeseburger with the addition of cheddar cheese.  She admitted to enjoying the burger immensely and I for once actually got a burger with a hefty layer of cheese on it.  It wasn't the largest burger I had by far but it tasted great!  I would have liked a slightly larger amount of fries.  Our waitress was friendly and brought prompt refills....however the only complaint I had is that once she brought the check she disappeared and did not revisit us again while we chatted about things in the process of getting to know each other.  I had thought about reducing the generous tip I had already included but reconsidered as it was the holiday season.  There are times where I sit and chat with my guests/companions after the tab has been paid, as I am sure most of you have done, but if service continues after that fact then additional tip will be generated.  This case.... shrug.  She noticed it too and had made a comment.  It is the reason this review is a 3 star and not a 4. Very nice looking inside and clean. All in all a decent visit and will probably return.

44,Mark P.,"Garner, NC",0,13,4.0,1.0,2015-02-24,"This is a horrible restaurant. I usually give a place three times before I give up on them. This will be the exception. Twice I have been here with my wife. Both times the service was HORRIBLE! This past go round was last Sunday after we watched a movie, we came for lunch. Ordered an app that the server said was his favorite, then proceeded NOT TO PUT THE ORDER in for it! Really!? It wasn't just us, all of his tables were looking for the server who was nowhere to be found. I can get past poor service if the food is at least good, which it wasn't. My wife ordered soup and salad, the salad was ok but the soup smelled like vomit. It was a frozen cheese and broccoli soup that was nasty. I love the burgers, but sadly I tried something different which was  the Reuben. I love Reuben's and this was absolutely NOT GOOD. It was dry, very little sauce, very little meat and was a real disappointment. At least the kitchen manager comped $8 after the fiasco of a meal. We won't be back mainly due to the service and to be honest I can get better burgers for less elsewhere.

Very Good - The Service.  Our server was very nice.  She kept everything refilled, food was delivered quickly and accurately.  Things were getting busy when we left, but she had no problems keeping up.  I recommend getting the cheddar mashed potatoes or mac & cheese sides - both were very good. Good - The kids liked their chicken and pasta meals.  The ""try three"" appetizer was generally good.  Great mozz sticks, decent wings, but the potato skins were missing the bacon and scallions, and not as good as I remembered from past visits to other TGIFs.  My husband's ribeye was good. Not great, but still edible - the chicken Jack Daniels was not nearly as good as I remembered.  The chicken part was ok, but it seems like something has changed with the Jack Daniels sauce.  It is not as tangy as it used to be, and is too sweet and oniony.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-garner-2?start=40,1.6440000000000001,1.6440000000000001,1.6440000000000001,1.6440000000000001,1.6440000000000001
37,Samantha V.,"Selma, NC",81,12,1.0,1.0,2015-04-27,"I visited this location last week Tuesday April 21st it was about 330. As i walked in the host greeted me and took me, my mother and grandma to our table. Before we were sat, a server came up to her and told her ""you know i'm cut right?"" the host proceeded to say ""yes, I know"" so she sat us in the section next to hers. Our host didn't tell us who would be taking care of us. We sat down and were trying to figure out what we wanted. A male server was taking care of a table right next to us, about a table away of three older people. He didn't acknowledge us once it seemed like he was doing it on purpose, as he walked back and forth about 6 times checking his other table out. I guess he finally realized he was going to be taking care of us and he finally came over to the table and introduced himself, his name was Greg. He took our drink order I ordered a multi berry smoothie, my grandma got a sweet tea, and my mother got a margarita on the rocks. We still weren't ready to order so he went to get our drinks. We waited for our drinks for over five minutes, which we found a bit ridiculous especially considering how long it even took to take the drink order. He FINALLY brought over our drinks and walked away. We didn't see him for another 5 minutes or so we started to look around for him and didn't see him anywhere. He finally came back to the table to take the order, My mother ordered ribs, my grandma ordered a plain cheeseburger and I ordered the Spicy Craft Beer-cheese Burger which comes with creamy craft beer-cheese sauce made with regionally crafted beer tops this black angus burger along with fresh sliced jalapenos, breaded fried jalapenos, chipotle mayo, lettuce, tomato and guacamole. I specifically asked for NO lettuce or tomato. After he took our order we didn't see him again until the food came out about 25 minutes later, which seemed like it took a while considering how slow it was at the time. When i looked around I only saw maybe 6 tables total in the whole restaurant. When the food finally came out, he quickly dropped it off and walked away. I needed to place a TOGO order so I had to flag him down to place that, which i got the Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Pasta. He walked away and I went to eat my burger, I took a look at it and the only things my burger had on it was A LOT of beer sauce, two pickles, two fresh sliced jalapenos and mayonnaise. I had no guacamole or breaded jalapenos. I didn't even want the burger anymore at this point. I looked around to try to find my server and he was nowhere to be found. I sat there for a few minutes and was extremely annoyed at this point, finally my mother got up and went to find a manager, before the manager came over the server had arrived so once the manager got there we told him everything had already been fixed. I had my food replaced with the Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Pasta it took about 15 minutes for it to come out and I still hadn't received my TOGO order at this point. I took a couple bites of my pasta and wasn't very satisfied there was only about 5 pieces of chicken and 4 shrimp but  I ignored it because I didn't feel like dealing with it. I asked for a box and the check. He brought the stuff over and seemed to be hanging around his section waiting for us to pay at this point. When we finally did pay, I realized i still hadn't gotten my TOGO order. That finally came out 10 minutes later. This was the worst experience I've had in a very long time.  I've been working in the food industry for 4 years, so I know what it's like. For the service to be so inconsistent and the food not even be correct during the slow period is absolutely ridiculous. It didn't even seem like he was trying. The only thing I could think of is that he was ready to go, and got off at 4 or 5 so he just didn't care about giving us good service. That's still no excuse though, weather first or last table everyone should get excellent service, or at least remotely good. I definitely won't be visiting you guys again i'd. I'll drive all the way to wake forest TGI' Friday's and that's an hour from where I live.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-garner-2?start=20,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001

The service and server were good, but the food is the reason for the low rating. As you can see in the pics it was not a pleasant meal.

She threw straws,rudely reached over people in my party and even cursed at us. That is NOT the way to do business. I don't care how good the food and drinks are.

7,Nicki S.,"Frisco, TX",49,251,24.0,2.0,2016-08-06,"We had a group of 8. Luckily we were able to be seated quickly so thats a plus. We ordered a few of the appetizers and a few meals, and 2 of the orders came out wrong. We had asked for plain chicken bites and the first ones came out buffalo, second attempt came out with some garlic sauce and then finally third try they came out correct and plain.  I ordered the Jack Daniels burger medium well. It came out well and then some. The edges were overcooked and burnt and the inside had ZERO pink in it. Not sure if theyre chef understands what medium is, but if not they should definitely retrain them. Our waitress was MIA most of the time. When food was wrong, she was nowhere to be found. We saw a tall manager lady walk by a few times and tried to get her attention but she even ignored us worse than the waitress. From the time we asked for our checks until the checks actually arrived was over 20 minutes. We even told the waitress we were trying to make a movie and needed to leave quickly but she cared very little about speed.  Some of the meals at the table were good, but half werent. I've ate at many Fridays before and they've been good so I'm not sure if its this location? Regardless, won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-garner-2,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0

A New York strip steak is priced at $22 comma and a half rack of ribs is $20. For these prices I'd rather go across the parking lot to a steakhouse. As it turned out later, we went to Logan's Steakhouse and paid $17 for a half rack of ribs with a skewer of shrimp , and a New York strip would have cost $18 if I had chosen to get one.

25,Emily E.,"Raleigh, NC",0,23,1.0,1.0,2017-03-24,"We waited about 30 min for table which is average for a Friday night. However the rating comes solely from our server Destiny. Get ready for an ear full. We sit down and she takes our drinks order (4 out of 5 order an alcoholic beverage). She comes back ten minutes later and takes our order, still no drinks. Fast forward to 25 minutes later, one guy at our table ordered an appetizer and it came out and still no drinks, not even the guy who ordered a sweet tea. I go and get the manager 5 minutes later. He apologizes repeatedly and gets our drinks and food and tells me the food will be comped. Our waitress comes over and proceeds to tell the table in front of us that ""here's my business card if you know anyone that's looking for an apartment I'm the assistant manager of a private company, we have three complexes and are getting our third one"". We FINALLY get our food, eat and of course none of the plates are sizzling but we're staving so we down them. Manager and other servers come to check on us. Our waitress then asks how we're splitting up the checks and returns saying that she understood there was a complaint and but she's really busy cause she's covering the front and back sections, so she comped the drinks. TEN minutes later she hadn't returned so we go ask for the manager. He comes back and states ""I'm sorry idk how she even got that, your food is comped I will ring fix this"". I reply that the couple next to us (older really nice couple whose been there almost 2 hours and was not happy) needs to be taken care of. The manager then states ""I'm sorry this is the worst server I have ever had to deal with"". We paid for our drinks and ran to Mexican place to get more drinks since we missed our movie and have to wait for the later show. Do NOT go there if your waitress is Destiny.

16,Autumn H.,"Garner, NC",4,10,12.0,1.0,2017-07-03,"I really didn't think that this place could have been as bad as the reviews stated but it was actually worse. Our experience this evening started with a 10 minute wait at the hostess stand without a single person coming to greet us or at least let us know what was going on, despite 4 different servers and the MANAGER walking by several times and looking at us and walking away. Finally after 10 minutes of standing there I was able to flag someone down and she went and found the hostess. The hostess rudely brought us to the table and sat the menus down and walked away without even telling us who our server would be. This was followed by another 10 minute wait of people walking by and not being greeted or acknowledged again. No bev naps, not so much as a hi or ""I'll be right with you"". When our server finally appeared he told us that the specials that we asked about were not happening despite the fact that I had the TGI Fridays website pulled up with the specials for today listed right in front of him. We finally just gave up and left, this place is pathetic. Pathetic service and especially pathetic management. The ""manager"" was a sad beaten down looking individual that I witnessed trudging around the restaurant but who never once checked on us throughout this process despite making eye contact with me on several occasions. He looked more like a homeless person who stole a uniform from the real manager and decided to throw it on and just stand around the restaurant. Needless to say we wasted 20 minutes or so here and we will never be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-garner-2,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002
20,Parrish H.,"Hurricane, WV",54,3,1.0,1.0,2017-07-03,"After 7 years working in casual restaurants, I feel like I know what I should and should not reasonably expect. My wife and I stood at the host stand for approx. 10 minutes to be seated. Understandably, the hostess was busy putting tables together for a large party, so I didn't really mind waiting. The manager delivered food to a table in the bar area right next to us, made eye contact with me, and walked away. I figured he was going to stow the tray, then come back and seat us. Naw. After a couple more minutes, the bartender came over and told us the hostess would be right over. She came shortly after that and seated us. During the 5 minutes we waited at our table for a server, the large party was seated, their drink order was taken, and that same manager walked right past our table 3 times. I noticed his shirt was wrinkled and partially untucked, which spoke volumes about how the restaurant must be run. When the server finally came to greet us, I noticed he had just walked into work not 2 minutes prior. He apologized for our wait, and went to check on some drink specials my wife saw online. He told us that they didn't honor the specials at this restaurant. Well, we just moved to the area and we're looking to celebrate with some drink and food specials tonight, and after the experience we'd had up to this point, we told the server thanks, but we kind of came out for those specials. He apologized and asked if we wanted to see the manager, and i felt like I had a few things to say to the guy. When he came out, I told the manager he had 4 opportunities to help us, but ignored us instead. I told him that his unkempt appearance set a bad example, and we were just really disappointed. He told me he was very sorry that I couldn't walk in his shoes. I let him know that I actually have, and we left. I don't think I've ever walked out of a restaurant before. Just go somewhere else that will actually appreciate your business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-garner-2?start=20,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002

We were seated as soon as we walked into the door so the evening started off on a positive note...but that's where it ended as far as customer service went. Our waitress had obviously been pissed off earlier because she wasn't friendly at all. When she brought our drinks she slammed one down on the table and walked off. That was her tone for the next hour we were there.  The food was really good though but it was overridden by a crappy waitress. Now I know why we hardly ever  go here...it's constantly reinforced every time we have eaten at his establishment.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-garner-2,1.64,1.64,1.64,,1.6400000000000001

4,Cameron W.,"Tomahawk, WI",0,2,,1.0,2018-01-12,"Last year on my way to Reno with my mother we had time to visit the MOA the day before our flight. She was dead set on eating at TGIF before we went in so we did. Neither of us had been to a TGIF in years as there is no restaurant close to where we live so we ordered our old usual Jack Daniels chicken strips and tried two sliders.  I don't drink much but a margarita sounded great so I also ordered one with no clue of the price. But how bad could it be?  I told the waitress I would take the drink with my meal. The waitress took the order and we didn't see her for about another 15 or so minutes. A different waitress brought us our tiny plate of pathetic looking ""chicken pieces"", and two sliders, no drink in site. The chicken wasn't like we remember at all. No crunchy stuff on top of the chicken which actually used to be chicken, smaller portion, no lettuce if I remember correctly.  It also used to be large enough to make a meal out of.  Literally 30 or so small chunks of crunchy stuffed with glaze and a few pieces of over fried chewy chicken mixed in. The sliders were pretty pathetic too for something like $10. Two 2"" wide sliders and 1/4"" thick patties on a white plate, that's it.  About 3/4 of the way through the meal the original waitress shows up and I ask for the margarita.  ""She says something like I'll go check on that.""   Like it takes a long time to make a margarita.  So we got done with the ""meal"" and the drink shows up.  Good margarita, a little heavy on the tequila.  Though I usually like to drink a margarita with my meal. A few minutes later I have to ask for my check as she walks by.  The check was something like $35.  I was shocked and could only laugh at being ripped off like that.  The drink was $10. She got a $.03 tip and TGIF lost a customer next Sep. when we make the same trip.  We went to the mall and I got a Nutella shake for $5 and we ate some of our snacks back at the hotel.   Used to be a great place to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-garner-2,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002
