I ordered the lunch size  pecan crusted chicken salad. DO NOT order a lunch size salad if you want a decent meal. The salad was tiny, 3 small pieces of chicken, 4 mandarin orange slices, 1 tiny piece of crumbled blue cheese and a small portion of greens. What a waste of $12.00!  Excuse: The waitress said they are using a smaller bowl. She realized this was inadaquate and offered to bring something additional.

This TGIF has lousy service. The waitress hardly ever came out of the back.  The food didn't come out for 45 minutes and when we did get the food it was all wrong.  We dared not send it back as our time was running short.  I really hate to admit this but we would have had better service and even  a better meal at the local McDonald's.  Really bad service.  It wasn't just us having a tough time that day with the service.  Too many customers and not enough servers.  I even think the cook must have been alone in that kitchen.  The food just wasn't coming out for anybody in a timely manner.

Have not been inside one of these restaurants for about 10 years.  The food is just bad.  Chicken arrived cold. Cold chicken implies they're re-heating a pre-cooked portion? Yuck.  Steak was a lovely glob of Transglutaminase (google or bing it) forged meat parts ...  Sides were just barfy too. Mac&Cheez struck me as pre-made/re-heated, was in some sort of alfredo or heavy cream sauce that lacked cheez flavor (or cheese flavor!) and then had some quick-baked cheddar and bread crumbs on top. Awful. Fries were cold too. I so rarely eat fries, when they come cold I am not a happy customer.  My dining companion asked for no onions. She got onions.  This whole meal just sucked.  I got what I expected.  Service, however, was quite polite.  I had to laugh however ... the server was trying to describe menu items by comparing them to some crap from a fast food joint ""They're like the extreme potato wedgies from KFC, only we do it better"" or ""It's like a Wendy's awful burger only beefier ...""  Manager knocked down the tab, in my experience ... if a ""real"" restaurant came through with such a poor showing - the whole tab would be free.

11,Dustin H.,"Washington, DC",231,35,89.0,1.0,2015-07-15,"TGI's at Gettysburg is by far the worst experience I've had in years. I really debated doing this but someone has to share in order for things to improve.  And that says something from someone who has worked in food service. You tend to have compassion if you've been in the field. We took our 8 year old for her birthday before a movie. We were there over 1 hour before everyone started leaving and we realized our food still wasn't coming. (I only knew because my text messages to folks congratulating my kids birthday events was time stamped to the exact moment we sat down at the table). When we asked to speak to a manager, we got the food and they wanted to comp one kids meal and give a kids movie ticket to a theater, but even after we went through all of that, I received the worst $12 burger I've ever had and my wife's vegetarian salad came with chicken right on top.  My specialty burger I got was supposed to have guacamole, peppers, cheese, lettuce, tomato and other stuff and it didn't have almost anything on it. (I cannot make this stuff up). I took a picture of my burger beside their actual burger ad for the burger and you can see for yourself. The manager came and checked and I didn't have the heart to send the burger back and wait another hour to feed the kids and see a movie, but I was shocked she couldn't see the discrepancy in the burger for herself and act and make the fix without asking. Again, the picture shows for itself. We missed the movie and changed our schedule. My daughter was really disturbed. We tried our best to do it as nicely as possible not to end a day that way but it was tough. As we told the manager and she did not deny, there was an epic failure in the team that day. It may be better on other days, but we did not have a good experience and even though we have a comp meal for a kid from this experience, we won't use it. Think we are don't with the chain altogether now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gettysburg,,,,,

I have been in the area for around years and the both the service and food has  deteriorated in that time.  Went for dinner and the experience started out rough. We put our name in for a group and set about to waiting outside. While waiting, they gave our table to another group that apparently ""responded to our name when called"".  Finally got seated and the waiter took over 25 minutes just to acknowledge the table and ask for drinks. Drinks took another 10 minutes. Our waiter did not even apologize for the long wait time at all - he just acted as if everything was okay.  The food took over an hour to arrive, and when it did, it was mostly lukewarm, and delivered by staff other than our waiter. I ordered a pick three as a dinner and my wings were not crispy at all either. Husband ordered a Jack Daniels burger, medium, and it came in well done, cold, and missing the sauce. The missing sauce took another 10 minutes.  We would have sent the food back but we were so hungry due to waiting an hour (maybe more) for food that we had to eat it. After dinner was finished it took another 20 minutes to revive our check. I would have asked to speak to a manager but after spending almost two hours I didn't want to wait another 25 minutes -- I was miserable and wanted to leave.
