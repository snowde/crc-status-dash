8,Kelly C.,"Chicago, IL",0,11,,1.0,2012-02-03,"This location of Fridays has the absolute worst service. I have been to many locations and never had an issue. My co-workers and I have given this location many chances on our lunch break and it seems it gets worse everytime. If you have any less than 2 hours to spend on lunch, STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION!! They wonder why this location is continuously empty during lunch hours. FYI its because your servers are SLOWWWWWW!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview?start=20,,,,,
17,Nina I.,"Chicago, IL",668,491,62.0,3.0,2012-02-05,"It's your typical and average TGI Friday's. Usually my orders are always entered wrong and since I'm a server I'm a lot kinder to the staff but I still have to repeatedly deal with inconsistencies in service and the way it is handled afterwords...  I had the Jack Daniels Grilled Chicken Sandwich and it was pretty good and filling. Couldn't finish the whole thing in one sitting but that's fine. I had a male waiter so this time was a little different in the sense that nothing was actually rung in wrong but overall the food is average and the service is what you pay for [but not in a good way, sorry].",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview,,,,,
28,Ajay S.,"Bartlett, IL",1,104,11.0,3.0,2012-02-15,"This is a standard American restaurant, with an ok menu.  I tried a pulled pork sandwich, which was ok, but I didn't care for sweet BBQ sauce.  What I did like was a sizzling chicken. I'd hop their lunch menu was a little better, but this is a franchise, so I don't see it being their fault. The restaurant was clean and the staff was helpful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview,,,,,
11,Vera Lynn W.,"Northbrook, IL",0,54,,3.0,2012-03-25,"Been here several times. It is always fair to middling, food wise. I had Yadira as a server. She was very good. No complaints. The boneless wings I ordered were too small. Too much breading; too little chicken. wouldn't order them again. Went back a few days later with my family. There were 8 of us. Henry was our server. He was Fabulous! Explained all the nuances of their menu, and was very patient with the lot of us. Everything came out just as ordered, even special requests. He was amazing. Kept our drinks full, both water and soda, which with 8 people is no mean feat. Now to the food. It was just ok. Nothing to write home about. Nothing to crave. I had the French onion soup. It was fine. Not great. Burger was better, but not very juicy. Would I come back here? Well, the location is convenient. So yes, but there are other places I'd rather go. Oh, and as an aside, if you order a drink at the bar and can watch them make it, it's ok. If you order at a table? It might as well be virgin. No alcohol whatsoever. Like they're saving that shot for the VIPs who are their regulars. Pass on a free dink and management won't know. 2 for food/ liquor. 4 for service. Average of 3.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview?start=20,,,,,
23,Ron S.,"Morton Grove, IL",8,41,39.0,4.0,2012-05-16,"I know most people don't think much of TGI Friday's, but my wife and beg to differ.  The menu rotates/updates often, so we often try their new items. Last time, they had Peruvian Rotisserie Chicken. This time they had Korean Steak Tacos.  We usually get in before the mad rush of people so the restaurant is typically clean and the staff is helpful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview,,,,,
9,Y. K.,"Glenview, IL",6,45,,4.0,2012-08-16,"I guess if you've tasted food at one TGI Fridays you've eaten at all of them.  However, not all have the same level of service.  This one was good in that sense.  The servers have personality, stay on their toes with your order and even the hostess goes out of her way to say goodbye when you leave.  All that doesn't hurt my hectic, stressful day at the office.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview?start=20,,,,,
2,Abe A.,"Des Plaines, IL",35,43,1.0,3.0,2012-11-05,"Typical American ""Friday"" evening restaurant. The food is good. I do recommend the Pastrami sandwich. The Margarita's are good and very large. The decor nothing like a higher end restaurant. Service was good. The server did spend time flirting with a group of girls next to us. If you do not have time to make dinner or visit a higher quality restaurant this location is good for a quick dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview?start=20,,,,,
4,Angelo C.,"Chicago, IL",80,240,136.0,3.0,2012-12-04,Just an OK experience. The avacado balsamic vingret was pleasantly different. The servers are friebdly but no name tags!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview?start=20,,,,,
27,Tina B.,"Niles, IL",0,2,,1.0,2013-04-19,"If I could could give 0 stars I would.  WORST dining experience ever.  I have been here several times thinking I would have a better experience each time ( cause the food is yummy and its close to my house.  But I kept having horrible service.  Everytime I went or I hear someone who has gone to this specific Fridays it happens.  They are ignored.  I have never been ignored by a waiter or waitress.  I was completely appalled at the service.  We were visited one time by our waiter and then he ""forgot"" about us because of we were in a different ""section"" then he should have had.  That was the excuse and tried to keep me happy by giving me coupons.  I don't want FREE things I want GOOD service !!!!  Never go here.  EVER!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview,,,,,
7,Ana C.,"Niles, IL",104,9,,4.0,2013-06-06,"Great food, become a Stripes member and they email you tons of coupons that we use all the time. Service is good, definitely satisfactory.

19,Luis O.,"Libertyville, IL",76,53,2.0,2.0,2013-08-28,Service is iffy here. Luckily they have good happy hour and lunch specials.  The last time I came here with a group from work it took almost an hour for our food. Luckily we didn't have any meetings or else we would have been screwed! $3 apps and drinks on Thursday and $6.99 endless lunch can't be beat however!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview,,,,,
16,Kristina W.,"Chicago, IL",19,29,13.0,4.0,2013-08-30,"Came here with family and our waitress was excellent! Her name was Chuka B (I made sure to take note of her name because she definitely deserves to be mentioned in this review). We had a party of 10 and she was very patient with us when taking our orders. Some members ordered the specialty lemonades and when they finished them, she made sure to mention that lemonade refills cost extra before whisking the glasses away. Not only was she informative, but also very customer oriented. For those who ordered steaks, she had them cut into it to see if it was cooked to their liking. I have never been to a restaurant where a waiter/waitress had the customers do that. Doing that is much better than cutting into it once they leave and then trying to flag him/her while you sit there going hungry. Excellent service from Chuka. I left that restaurant very content and happy with her service.  Food was good. I had the Jack Daniels burger which was tasty, but nothing to rave about. This review was just to mention the awesome service we had at TGIF.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview,,,,,
18,Katarina K.,"Wheeling, IL",133,30,23.0,2.0,2013-10-26,Food tasted like it was frozen and  warmed up in a microwave. for a salad. they  gave me a large piece of lettuce and small bites of tomatoes.  Shrimp and fries. was thrown on plate and served. Cant blame the waiters . they do their job right The cooks and TGI  need to up date their cooking skills.  YIKES Stomach ace,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview,,,,,
25,Broni R.,"Glenview, IL",17,40,30.0,5.0,2013-12-07,"Hubby and I starting making this place a regular when I was pregnant and had late night cravings. We now come for a mini date night or with baby. Very accommodating staff and food isnt bad either. I means its TGIF. Plus everyday Mon-Thur, they have specials on apps and drinks. Comfortable ambience for any crowd anytime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview,,,,,
22,Kevin S.,"Skokie, IL",2,34,,4.0,2014-05-19,"$3 martinis AND 1/2 price bottles of wine AND 1/2 price appetizers on WEDNESDAYS.  I have come here every Wed for the last 4 weeks with friends - strictly for the specials.  It seems like Wed seems to draw in a crowd of regulars all there for the same reason.  Staff at the bar is always fun and helpful - especially Natalia.  ""Martinis"" include some specialty drinks like Cosmos so something for everyone.  Bottles of wine are reasonably priced.  LaCrema Chardonnay for $25 (before the 1/2 off) - Mid range vintages but mid-range prices - but 1/2 off makes them very reasonable for a restaurant.  Bar service is 5 stars - menu selection is 3 stars - just not enough healthy options.  Does the F in TGIF really stand for FRIED?  Regardless, you know what you are getting when you go here.  Definitely recommed on Wed for the specials",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

5,Debra G.,"Mount Prospect, IL",0,1,,4.0,2014-06-06,"My family and I go this to particular friday's very often. There is always at least 6 of us, sometimes over 10 of us. Every server we have had has been able to handle my crazy family and get all of our orders perfectly. Everyone there is more than willing to help us and always have answers to every question. The food is always fantastic as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview?start=20,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005

21,Christine K.,"Glenview, IL",3,46,42.0,4.0,2014-07-03,i really like that this place is open until 2am. The staff at night is super friendly as well.

14,Jerry C.,"Chicago, IL",416,17,6.0,3.0,2014-07-22,"Came here with a couple of friends for the unlimited apps deal they have going on right now. We shared unlimited boneless wings, potato skins, mozzarella sticks, and bruschetta in addition to a couple of drinks. Our waitress was very good about putting our orders so that there was very little wait time in between our servings.  Most of the food was fairly average. The bruschetta was pretty solid every time. The chicken was unfortunately, mostly breading. Also the parmesan garlic sauce tasted more like butter than said flavors. The potato skins and mozz sticks tasted decent as well. We also shared the tenessee whiskey cake, which I thought tasted good. My mojito left a little more to be desired, as it was more lime and less mint than Id like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
20,Staci W.,"Chicago, IL",3,48,24.0,1.0,2014-11-13,"Horrible costumer service at the bar. Very inattentive, had to wait for about 25 minutes for anyone to ask us if we were ready to order food and since first thing we asked for was the menu you would figure we were hungry. How does that happen with two bartenders and total of 7 people at the bar (thats including us). Seriously?. I gave this place a try for a third time now, after not so great service last two times but no change. Definitely not coming back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
12,Louis O.,"Niles, IL",0,21,,5.0,2014-12-07,"What the heck happened?! This place was a really terrific restaurant! What a shame if they closed forever.
