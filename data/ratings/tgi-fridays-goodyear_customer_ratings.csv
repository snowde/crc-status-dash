10,B P.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,6,3.0,2.0,2012-03-24,"After a late flight in, my wife and I wanted to get a quick bite and a drink before going home. We had 3 choices. Chili's was crowded, Applebee's was packed, so we went to Fridays that was not crowded at all. I now know why. Food took over 30 minutes, for 2 appetizers, TV's were playing the local news with no sound or CC (might as well had muted C-SPAN on), and all anyone working there wanted to do was closing clean up, even though they had 2 1/2 more hours to go till closing. Food was ok, service was sub-par. Needless to say we will not be going there again, unless there are no other options. Still would probably just go home hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-goodyear,,,,,
5,Ahmee J.,"Phoenix, AZ",28,9,,1.0,2012-05-29,Came here for dinner after not visiting this restaurant for all most over a year and now I know why I haven't . They ran out of ribs so I order the 10oz steak and it taste burnt and it was very tough! I didn't even finish half the steak ! The happy hour specials are great but there dinner entires  are horrible ! Also the men's restroom was a mess trash over flowing with dirty paper towels and the floor was covered in urine ! Probably won't be visiting T.G.I Friday's anytime soon!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-goodyear,,,,,
8,Stephanie S.,"Mohave, AZ",35,28,3.0,1.0,2012-07-16,"The best part of the meal was our server, she was friendly and attentive.  The food was pathetic.  Ordered potato skins and each one had a few crumbs of bacon and a pinch of cheese, about the size of a quarter on each.   My  friend ordered the spinach dip and it was good, but I was still disappointed looking at my potato skins sitting there so lonely and naked...Sat near the window, big mistake, it was so hot!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-goodyear,,,,,
7,Carlie W.,"Litchfield Park, AZ",131,44,124.0,1.0,2012-10-07,"I ordered two ribeye steaks, med-rare, baked potatoes.  The steaks were not rare, they were raw. The potatoes were not even cooked, hard as a rock. One potato was the size of a lemon, the other was a huge baker. The manager was not apologetic and flip, and advised we were free to drive back down to the restaurant to have it re-cooked. We had ordered it to go, so driving back to the restaurant I've miles at eight pm, didn't sound like a great plan.  The attitude from Jason the manager just added insult to injury.  The dessert and salad were great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-goodyear,,,,,
4,Caroline D.,"Surprise, AZ",20,78,38.0,4.0,2012-10-26,"This was the first time I had ever been to a T.G.I Friday's and it was excellent. The queso appetizer left something to be desired and could use a little more seasoning, My Jack Daniels burger was AMAZING it was juicy and fresh and just all around awesome especially with the sweet potato fries. Our server was awesome as well. Will definitely be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-goodyear,,,,,

1,Taylor M.,"Litchfield Park, AZ",30,20,4.0,1.0,2013-05-24,"This place is terrible.  Ordered two draft beers.. the sat at the bar for five minutes befor our server ever got around to bringing them to our table.  Ordered queso dip and chips, as well as flat bread.  All cold.  Our first clue this place was crappy was the hugh rip in the booth seat. ( and the huge rip in the booth seat in the next booth as well) This place is bacically a waffle house that serves beer.  Dont waste you time.  Walk across the street to Chili's and you'll feel like you've up graded to a 5 star restaurant compaired to this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-goodyear,,,,,
