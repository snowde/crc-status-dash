4,William A.,"Denver, CO",13,171,15.0,2.0,2012-04-07,"As a chain restaurant, you would think they could teach the staff on how to remove the uneatable onion skin. The food was okay tasting, but definitely over priced for the quality/quantity. The ahi tuna with avocado crisp were good, but wish they gave more than just 5 small bites worth. They do have a tendency to drench the food in the Jack Daniels sauce, smothering any respectful taste that the meat might have.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greeley,,,,,
