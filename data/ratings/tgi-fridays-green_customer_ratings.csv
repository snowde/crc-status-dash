3,Sarah N.,"Madison, WI",11,8,,3.0,2012-06-28,"Your usual, average American fare. Nothing spectacular but nothing that's terrible, either. I did have some plastic in a salad here once, but the kitchen manager did her best to make up for it. The staff at the bar is nice and it's convenient to the Fairfield Inn, so I'll keep coming back, if only for the cold drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-green?start=20,,,,,
18,Matt R.,"New Orleans, LA",524,513,289.0,3.0,2012-10-25,"Typical Friday's... food was descent, service was ok, location was very convenien to the Fairfield in that I was staying at next door. In fact, if it were not for the fact that I was staying next door, I likely would not return to this restaurant.  BOTTOM LINE: Nothing great, nothing bad... just your average Friday's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-green,,,,,
0,Jennifer E.,"Chicago, IL",8,10,,5.0,2012-11-21,"This Friday's in particular is awesome and I especially want to give a shout out to their bar staff. They simply do it right at this location. Bartenders are talented and sincerely friendly. And, if you're lucky, you'll get to catch a flair routine or two from them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-green?start=20,,,,,
20,Candace M.,"Spokane, WA",277,671,1142.0,2.0,2014-01-08,"I went to this location a lot when I was younger and had pretty good experiences. Most recently, I wanted to take my mom and siblings out for dinner, and I let them choose. This was their location of choice. I was fine with it; little did I know that we'd have a dinner that left much to be desired. First, I know that our waiter is normally a bartender. I'd read rave reviews about him, and I was excited that we had someone so outgoing and personable! Unfortunately, he was only that way to the tables around us; in fact, he seemed too preoccupied to take care of our basic needs during the meal, while he was joking around and laughing with the table in front of and behind us.  When we finally did get our order, none of us were particularly happy with what we got. We all had chicken dishes. Most notably mom had a side of ""rice pilaf,"" which was steamed white rice with a few cut up red pepper pieces in it. My peach sangria was pretty good, but it was $10.69 for a single glass; seriously?!  Overall, the service, food, and prices left us all pretty disappointed. I can think of a lot of other restaurants in Akron (some right down the street) that are much more deserving of a visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-green,,,,,
21,Ron B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",752,105,516.0,3.0,2014-04-21,"This was a nice place as far as TGI Friday's go. It had that warm and fuzzy local community feel to it, which made it almost charming.  Feeling practically stranded 5 miles south of downtown Akron,  This place was a welcome respite.  And surprisingly,  the brand really is doing a decent job for existing in the casual dining category. The beverage menu is good;  the food menu offers plenty of bargains,  the staff is nice enough, and the food execution is pretty good.  The street fare type menu I ordered from was trendier than I might have expected here. This is NOT fine dining - but it's not bad,  either!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-green,,,,,
25,Chandler S.,"Cincinnati, OH",3,18,2.0,4.0,2014-08-18,Sat at the bar and got great service from a nice guy named Ryan. The food is like any other TGI Fridays. The staff was pleasant overall.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-green,,,,,
23,Andy B.,"Akron, OH",1,34,6.0,3.0,2015-01-03,"I met some friends for dinner/drinks last night.  Guess where?  Seriously, guess!  There's no better place to spend a Friday night than tGI Fridays.  The food was good but the service sucked, I was embarrassed for how incompetent our wacked out waiter was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-green,,,,,
22,Jake K.,"Vancouver, WA",51,33,188.0,3.0,2015-01-07,"It's a TGI Fridays. Same here as everywhere. Older building, not really any amazing personalities or specials to come here for. But the food Is always 'good' and you know what you are going to get. I've never had a bad meal OR service at this location. Consistency counts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-green,,,,,
2,Josh C.,"Akron, OH",14,2,,2.0,2015-03-20,"Food was good, long time for service though. Some of the employees were a little unprofessional. It's odd hearing bartenders and servers talk about how much they hate their jobs when they're right in front of you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-green?start=20,,,,,
19,Steven P.,"Louisville, OH",0,2,,1.0,2015-03-23,Where to start. Dirty glasses. Ordered tea with NO lemon. Got a lemon. Might as well stuck a dirty finger in the glass. Lemons are rarely washed. Food ordered came out wrong. My wife's soup on my plate and for some reason a handful of fries. My fries on her plate. Fries were little random ends of crusty cold yuck covered in salt on both plates. Inedible. They were cold and drowned in salt they call seasoning. My wife's soup was hot. My au jus which was onion soup was cold. Prime dip was room temperature and dry with the appearance of old deli meat. Flavorless. My wife's sandwich looked like one that you get at Circle K wrapped up with an expiration date. Service was non existent.  When asked how everything was it was of no interest to the server there were mistakes. Thank you for reminding me why I never eat at Friday's. Just plain bad.   Avoid. Best thing could be to become an empty building.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-green,,,,,
1,Liv T.,"Akron, OH",1,30,,4.0,2015-05-24,So good! Love the apps! Friendly staff!! Great drinks!! My meals have always been so good and that's why I will continue to go back! Whiskey cake was my dessert!! Yummy!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-green?start=20,,,,,
6,Brittany K.,"Huntersville, NC",5,108,526.0,3.0,2015-09-16,"Came to this TGI Fridays for a late late dinner after travelling all day.  This location is located right next to the Fairfield Inn and Suites Akron South so it is extremely convenient for a late night dinners or a much deserved after work drink.  We arrived at 10:30 and were happy to know that the kitchen serves food until midnight.   We came on a Monday night and sat at the bar.  It was fairly busy with other business travelers and some locals.  We had a very friendly bartender who was very attentive with a great outgoing personality.  They had fantastic drink specials ($3 Martinis, Mojitos, Margaritas, etc.)  The drinks were freshly made, had a generous pour and of course that amazing price tag.  The restaurant  See attached picture for the specials for the rest of the week.   They were also having a special on appetizers - $5 for select appetizers.  We decided for forgo a full mean and order apps.  We got Mozzarella sticks, fried green beans, bbq chicken flatbread (half without chicken for me) and wings with ghost hot sauce.  The portions were good for $5.  Unfortunately the food was very bad.  Both the mozzarella sticks and the fried green beans came out cold.  Not lukewarm, cold.  The marina sauce was also cold.  It made me feel like these were made hours ago and leftover.  The wings were boneless chicken and the ghost hot sauce was mild.  I expected at least a little kick.  The flatbread was the only decent one we tried but even it tasted leftover as the bottom crust was soggy.  All in all the food was not adequate. So 5 stars for the drink and service and 1 star for the food.  This place is worth it if you go for the drinks or if you are just too tired to drive somewhere else for some good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-green,,,,,
17,Jennifer G.,"Akron, OH",1,13,,2.0,2016-02-22,"I was brought the wrong salad by a server (who wasn't our original server). I had already picked through it, trying to figure out why it didn't look right, when she returned from the kitchen with the correct one. We switched plates and she took a few steps back toward the kitchen, then turned around and went and served the salad to its correct table. I had my fingers in that salad. I can't believe she still served it! In addition, the man who WAS our server, never came back to ask us if we wanted a refill on our drinks, even though he made several return (flirting) appearances to the table of women next to us. He spent a lot of time looking busy at the bar, which was a few feet from us and more or less ignored us. I had been to this location a few months before and ordered a steak, medium. It was charred on the outside, more or less raw on the inside. It came with 2 sides. The mac & cheese was good, but the caprese salad had wrinkled tomatoes in it which had obviously seen better days. I couldn't even make myself eat it. The place was more or less empty at the time (around lunch) with a few stragglers at the bar who were obviously known to each other and having a good time. They stuck me in a back corner and ignored me.  So done with this place. Is there even a manager here?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-green,,,,,
24,Lisa A.,"Akron, OH",0,4,,1.0,2016-08-12,"We have tried this location on and off for many years and the service can be decent. Unfortunately, not tonight. My son loves the sesame jack chicken strips so we agreed to give it another try. Big mistake. Drinks took forever and it took almost 1 hour to get our food. I had a sandwich, my husband had a bowl of soup, one sesame jack chicken strip appetizer and an order of chicken strips. Not to complicated. We usually order soup and salad because we figure the kitchen can't mess it up too much. We should have stuck with that. My sandwich, the mahi mahi with Naan bread, was overcooked and not edible. My husband's soup had a film on top of it. Maybe sat under the warmer too long. Chicken dishes were fine. The server was no where to be found most of the time. Shane, the manager, was very nice and did comp most of the bill which was nice. This location just really needs help with service and food quality. The management always tries to accommodate but it would be nice if food and service were right the first time. We always leave  here irritated which is why we rarely eat here. Please, Corporate, help them!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-green,,,,,
11,Richard B.,"Akron, OH",25,202,,2.0,2016-09-29,"I don't know what's happening at Fridays these days, but prices are up, portions are way down and service here totally bit. the $18.00 piece of salmon couldn't have gone over  4 ounces. The chicken in their cajun pasta dinner had gone South for winter, the ribeye was ""chewy gristly and tough"" per that diner and even the sides were skimpy. Back in the day, the sides is how they filled the plate. A plate with 2 sides here is hard-pressed to cover 40% of the plate's landscape, kinda like three golf balls on a putting green. The service? If one of your party orders a ""popsicle"" drink ...take the order go on a 1/2 hour break then come back to say you're out of popsicles, do you want the drink without one?  And that was the GOOD part of the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-green,,,,,
15,Brian L.,"Akron, OH",28,10,,1.0,2017-02-19,Of course come here for endless apps and all the ones we want they are our of.

12,Cindy A.,"Massillon, OH",5,18,2.0,1.0,2017-05-07,"Got there on a Sunday afternoon. Not busy. Maybe 4 tables filled. This should've been our first sign to go somewhere else!! Server did not want to be there as her crappy attitude showed it. Waited a long time for 2 burgers, and they were just barely warm when we received our meal. Fries tasted old. Waited for manager who never came by. TGIF is definitely going down hill. Will not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-green,,,,,
14,Ryan B.,"Hartville, OH",0,23,4.0,2.0,2017-06-14,"Food was good... came in on a Sunday afternoon around 4pm with a party of 4... they were not that busy.  Service was terrible. It seemed like our waiter only had his interests on his mind. Food took forever to get, yes it was good, but it took forever.  The waiter always ignored us, he would constantly walk by our table and never offer any refills. Then when it came to our check, I had to grab another waitress and she checked us out while he stood there and talked to another customer. 2 stars because the food was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-green,,,,,
13,Brian G.,"North Myrtle Beach, SC",5,14,5.0,1.0,2017-06-18,"Over the last few years the service has really dropped off. Mostly the the hostesses and detail of the wait staff. Tried it today, 10 minutes for a hostess and the place was only half full. The waitress explained she was busy with her new boyfriend in back, then the waitress never came back after taking our order. I blame the management for allowing these employees to act like this with there guests.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-green,,,,,
7,Jonathan F.,"New Franklin, OH",3,23,9.0,2.0,2017-06-30,"Just when you thought there couldn't be a more impressively disappointing food and service combination than the Arlington Rd Applebee's, the Green TGI Friday's boldly steps in to fill the lower echelon void we were all hoping would never be filled.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-green,,,,,
16,Katlin D.,"Akron, OH",0,5,1.0,1.0,2017-08-21,"The past two times (I like to give second chances) I've been here the service was absolutely horrible. I'm not the one to complain about my meal or service (as I'm a waitress myself and understand that sometimes things can happen/mistakes are made), so this is a rare post from me. This past time I visited TGI Friday's in Green with my parents in the afternoon. We were the only table in the bar area, where the bartender was the waitress as well as the bartender. Our waitress was very short and never smiled. She would yell from the bar rather than approach our table. She was fighting with other employees in the back and behind the bar - not a good look for a company. When our food came out from another employee, the sandwich I got (buffalo chicken) looked and was delicious. The fries were cold and chewy, but I wasn't going to complain about it. When she dropped off the food I immediately realized that it was missing avocado, which is one of the reasons I ordered it. My dad had the same sandwich and it was not on his either. I told the employee, ""I'm sorry I think they forgot the avocado on our sandwiches."" Her response was, ""Okay,"" (and not a happy one at that). She went to the kitchen where we assumed she was getting the avocado. Ten minutes later it was delivered to us after that employee yelled to the bartender (who was confused and unaware they even forgot our avocado) that it was sitting on the bar for her to take over to us. At this point, my dad had finished his sandwich and I was half way through with mine. I am not kidding you when I say she delivered us 2 slices for two huge sandwiches. I was so astonished that I took a picture. When the bartender dropped it off she probably noticed our ""seriously?!"" faces because she said, ""It's 2 slices for 2 sandwiches, did you want more?"" We replied with, ""Nope."" Completely shocked, we didn't complain about our service to a manager because we aren't like that, but obviously should have. Needless to say I will most likely not be back. Too bad the sandwich was really good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-green,,,,,
9,Dirk P.,"Covington, KY",0,8,,1.0,2017-08-29,"Service here is terrible. Food was mediocre, had a good steak. Everything else is a joke. Too much to write. I would still eat here because I am traveling. Did not have to drive anywhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-green,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
8,NuggetLover N.,"Cleveland, OH",2,2,5.0,1.0,2017-10-06,"Only gave this place one star because no stars isn't an option... waited forever for our food only to bite into cold wings and a stale, burnt cheeseburger. Server was rude, and left for long periods of time.. to top it off my order wasn't even correct. WILL NOT BE BACK. Gross.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-green,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
