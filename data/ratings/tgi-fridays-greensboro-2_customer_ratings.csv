27,Alex R.,"Greensboro, NC",250,359,155.0,2.0,2012-04-08,No impressed at all. The greeters were sluggish and could clearly care less about being there doing their jobs. We were placed in one of the booths for two. There is honestly no wiggle room there.  Our server was one of those...fake nice kind of people. She smiled and sounded nice but as soon as she turned away her smile turned into a scowl. She wasn't in a good mood and it showed in her performance as a server.  The food was over priced and the portions were unbelievably small. They really shouldn't put a picture of the food on the menu if it is going to look like the kid size version of the meal. I honestly chuckled when I saw how small the portions were especially compared with the price.  I'm sorry but when you laugh at the food...there is an issue.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greensboro-2?start=40,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024
45,Michael C.,"Richmond, VA",43,30,1.0,1.0,2012-07-07,"OK so I dont usually waste my time reviewing chain restaurants but this one was sooooooo bad that I wouldnt feel good unless I put this out there. It was Monday night and we shouldve known when the other four chains within a stones throw were slammed packed and Fridays was empty that something was amiss.  We go and sit at the bar, as we do at chains just to get faster drink service. The service at the bar was the only high light of the evening.  The bar was sticky and in a sad state of disrepair. It smelled like they mopped the floor with the swill from the bar mats, the bar stock was more than half empty... a liquor shelf with 50% stock gone and a visible back up liquor cabinet with 2 bottles in it??? After inquiring about why half of the liqour (Most useed to make Friday's signature drinks) had not been stocked, we got the reply ""Well we have a new bar manager.""  On several occasions we noticed most of the staff hanging out at the service bar or the host stand ""goofing off"" with who I am guessing was the manager on duty...The whole attitude of the staff was unprofessional and almost like they couldnt be bothered.  The food... wow... crap at best. Te spicy craft beer cheese burger... well it wasnt spicy, the cheese tasted like yesterday, and I have seen better burger buns on a Gas Station burger! Silverware dirty, fries luke warm... but the beer... it was cold and filled when we wanted!  the two bar tenders on duty were great, attentive when needed, and seemed to be great stars who needed a better venue to perform.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greensboro-2?start=60,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003

How odd is it to have to wait ten minutes for someone else at your table to get their food before you start eating? Very odd. To top it off, the food was simply not up to par. I ordered the Korean Steak Tacos. If there was steak in my tacos, I sure couldn't find it. Honestly, the rice was the most flavorful part of my meal, and that's not saying much. The child screaming at the table across from us and the kid yelling and climbing all over the booth behind me sure didn't help. Let's just say that this location attracts a fairly tawdry customer base. Had I of known this before hand, I would not have stopped here to eat.

Both were delicious.  Our entrees were the steak tacos and brucetta chicken pasta. The tacos looked better than they tasted, but they were ok. The pasta was very good with plenty of large slices of chicken. We were happy with our meal and experience.   We were glad to see they had remodeled since our last visit which was years ago. They now have booths against the front windows rather than the ugly red  and white striped tables. They changed the wall to the bar area to a nice glass wall with frosted stars on it. Much classier looking and not as dark. We will go back and order off of the same menu. Ask for the 2/$10 if you don't see it. It is hidden on the small menu booklet on the tables.

They have an array of burgers, pastas, steaks, etc. Their new tasting menu seems very interesting and good for groups. Prices range from about 9$ to 15$ dollars. Our server, James, seemed very attentive, but the restaurant was also very slow when we went. Our food arrived quickly and was tasty.  The only thing that we did not like was the music.

But I tried to order the queso fries and they were out of queso. She then offered me this bottomless fries deal. She never came back and checked on us. She acted as if it was a burden to speak to us, to refill our drinks or ask if I wanted anymore fries. She even avoided walking past our table. I've never had such awful service from such an awful person. As someone who has been a waiter before, she'd be fired in three seconds if she had my manager.

She clearly couldn't be bothered to check either. She came to our table only twice and she took 20 minutes to refill our drinks. When she returned with our sons drink she forgot our water and it took 20 more minutes and a different server to fill our glasses. She then took a long while to bring our check. When she returned with our debit card she left no pen so I had to track down some one at the front to give me one.

We sat at the bar, and ordered an appetizer, two entrees, and a few drinks each. While the service was good and the drink specials were also good, the food quality simply left a lot to be desired. My jack Daniels chicken had a weird spongey texture to it. Her teriyaki chicken was kind of like what you'd find at a mall Chinese place. The potato skins had a weird nacho cheese like topping on them that wasn't appetizing. Not a bad location or atmosphere, and I might even hit the bar for drinks if I'm in a hotel here again, but I doubt I'll be returning for food especially with so many other options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greensboro-2?start=40,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000004

Our server was AWOL for most of the night. The soft pretzel & beer cheese appetizer was wonderful, however that was the only enjoyable part of the meal. Items were missing from my burger (how can anyone forget pickles, tomato & sauce??)  The ""bartender"" used blue cheese stuffed olives as the garnish in my dirty Grey Goose martini (in over 2 decades I've never had one served his way.) The flavor was disgusting since the cheese permeating the entire drink, giving it a rancid taste, not to mention I'm allergic to blue cheese.  My husbands burger was well done & was supposed to be rare.  The room we were seated in must have been an afterthought add-on room as there were no air vents for heat & the wall next to our booth had no insulation. It was 10°F outside.

31,Rick T.,"Westminster, SC",0,30,,1.0,2016-10-25,"Never ever again, however it is a very good location for someone to build a good restaurant!  Now before you think I am being mean, think again.  Once you know how bad it really was you will understand.  I ordered a cob salad with grilled shrimp (Japanese spicy).  My wife French onion soup and a side salad.  Some time later her order arrived and I was told mine was coming.  Much much later mine arrived.  Mind you hers was hot (soup)and ready to eat. She said the soup was good.  When my salad finally arrived every thing was ice cold including the shrimp and bacon.  The only excuse here if I am allowed to guess - they grilled what they had to and then put it all in a freezer.  Had the shrimp not been frozen cold along with the bacon  and hard boiled eggs it would have been good.  The avocado was a nice touch.  I was ask if the vinaigrette would be ok. and I said sure but was never told they charged an extra $3.75 for a little blue cheese sprinkled on one side.  At that rate a small container of cheese must make them around $100.00 per small container. I remind you the cheese was never ordered.  Worse yet was tea - hot poured over ice which of course melted 90% of the ice.  Never got a refill or ice to chill the tea.  At $2.68 for a glass of watered down week lousy tea - you can say rip off again and again.  After the meal was almost over napkins finally came out.  A sure sign of a bad place to eat.  As bad as the service was it cut their rating way down  but not saying it was a frozen salad made it unbearable.  I ask you why are they not even close to serving both meals together.  Worse yet why do they grill shrimp and bacon and then freeze it.  Why not just serve boiled shrimp if they must ruin it by being to cold to eat.  Then rip people off by putting on an upcharge you did not order?  Tea at almost three bucks and never refill it. unforgivable to say the least.  Now my next comment should be against the law and any decent person will agree.  There is never a reason not to allow clean napkins on a table.  Your dinner ware delivered to the table wrapped in a paper napkin is not a napkin you should put to your mouth.  You have no idea how many people with unwashed hands handling the flatware inside a surely unsanitary paper napkin - just not good anyway you argue it.  Would not suggest this place to anyone I liked - don't walk away - RUN",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greensboro-2?start=40,2.12,2.12,2.12,1.604,2.12
14,Cedric B.,"Greensboro, NC",23,1,,1.0,2016-11-27,"I visited this location on Wendover Ave in Greensboro, NC this evening to redeem a gift card given to me.  I haven't been to Friday's in years but decided to use the card after work.  I tried to order a classic cheeseburger with gouda online but I couldn't find a gift card option so I called it in.  I asked for my total and was told, ""I don't know, I just put in the order."" I arrived at the restaurant about 20 minutes later and still ended up waiting about another 15 minutes to get my food.  However, it felt more like 45 because there was someone who appeared to be homeless and/or with mental health issues at the bar who wouldn't stop talking to me/himself.  When my food finally made it out my pre-tax total was $10.39 (online to the pre-tax total was $9.90, including) and that struck me as odd.  Nonetheless, I gave the server my $10 gift card and a $5 to cover the total check ($11.09).  After another lengthy wait, the server returned with $3.00 change.   After she walked off, I went and found her and essentially confirmed that I had been shorted my change and she simply replied that she didn't have any change.  At this point, I was so upset, tired, and hungry that I wished her a good night and walked out.   When I get home about 10 minutes later my burger was essentially cold and the cheese was unmelted.  After microwaving it and taking 2 bites I gave up and started writing this.  I could typically handle any of these issues individually.  But all this occurring at once after driving across town at the end of a long cold day of work was a bit much.  The bar nor the restaurant were busy (to the point that many of the servers were sitting around enjoying their down time). This was a pretty unfortunate first time back and I should be happy it only cost me $2 (including the server's ""self tip""). But it is highly unlikely that I will return to my local Friday's anytime soon or recommended it to friends, family or Greensboro visitors.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greensboro-2,2.12,2.12,2.12,1.6680000000000001,2.12
