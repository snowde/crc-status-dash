9,Big J.,"Pittsburgh, PA",49,388,268.0,5.0,2012-01-22,"Everyone could use more Friday's.  After having an excellent meal at the T.G.I. Friday's in Greensburg this past weekend, I find that I could not agree more with the trendy restaurant's slogan.  The nationwide restaurant and bar, which prides itself on its love for red and white stripes, has always been a reliable good meal for my family and friends when we find that we have no specific food that we are craving.  In this particular case, the wait for the next-door-neighbor restaurant, Texas Roadhouse, was far too long of a wait, so my friend and I walked over to Friday's and grabbed a table. Before even walking into the restaurant, I had only one thing on my mind: steak.  Actually, I was craving any plate of food that I knew Saint Vincent's cafeteria would not be serving up anytime soon, so that is what brought my attention to the idea of enjoying a prime cut of cow.  Now, I am going to state simply that nothing satisfies me more than a rare cut of carne.  When I order a steak at a restaurant, I want my first slice into the middle of the meat to cause all the glowing, red liquid to spill out all over my plate.  That to me is the sign of a perfectly cooked and settled order of steak.  After much debate with my inner feelings, I finally decide to be adventurous and ask for the ginger-lime slaw to accompany my usual order of medley vegetables.  I have never ordered coleslaw at a restaurant.  The reason is not that I do not like the side dish; however, my assumption has always been that a bowl full of cabbage and carrots is positioned somewhere near the bottom of the totem pole of foods that satisfy my rumbling stomach.  Like I said, I was feeling adventurous, so I placed my order and hoped for the best.  This is the point during the dining experience where I start to become anxious.  I have already placed my order, and my only desire in the world at that moment is to enjoy my plate of food.  Well, after about ten minutes, that dream became a reality.  The food on the plate is situated rather elegantly.  My ten-ounce cut of steak is beautifully charred with the signature diamond accent marks from the grill, and the bright hues from my vegetable medley are adding life to the plate; then, that is when my eyes focus in on the bowl of coleslaw.  I feel my hand growing a mind of its own as it starts to reach for the cold, metal utensil.  The four pointed prongs of the fork dig their way deep into the bowl of green and orange and lift out a dripping pile of what the all-American restaurant calls ginger-lime slaw.  The fork then makes its way towards my mouth.  I start to chew, and once I swallow, I find my hand quickly reaching for more slaw.  It is surprisingly delicious.  My left hand must have then decided it was time for protein because it lunges for the steak knife.  As I cut into the middle of the meat, I find my satisfaction level reaching a new high.  The glowing, red liquid from the steak that I anticipated earlier begins to flow into my vegetable medley.  The ten-ounce sirloin tastes just as good as it looks.  It is cooked so perfectly raw that I do not even need to ask the waiter for any steak sauce.  Instead, I let the natural juices from the animal keep my palate moist.  The snow white plate that used to hold my food now resembles the barren land of the Arctic.  I feel that you can always judge how good a meal was based on how quickly you finish it, and in my opinion, any meal that takes under five minutes to devour is a success.   As I made my way through the masses of people waiting for a table, I felt myself feeling satisfied and accomplished.  While walking to the car, I decided in my head that Friday's was going to receive a perfect five out of five star rating for this meal.  All my desires were satisfied beyond expectation, and I even found a new love for the simple side dish of coleslaw.  The only thing left I wanted was a chauffeur, so I would be able to nap during the drive home.  Even though I just had my fill of all-American food last night, I am finding myself agreeing with the restaurant's slogan that I could use more Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greensburg,,,,,
11,Rachel L.,"Irwin, PA",2,4,2.0,5.0,2012-04-19,"My fiancé and I visited TGI Friday's for a late dinner last night. Many people I know don't care for TGI, say its just okay, nothing special. To those people I would say give it a second look, it's worth it.  This particular TGI is clean and aesthetically pleasing. We had a sweet, older waitress. I asked her about one of their desserts and received an informative, practical answer to my question (wow, that's amazing!). On their own, the prices for most things are not overly expensive, but are a little higher than I think they should be (that's just my opinion). That being said, they have two brilliant specials. A three course meal (1 appetizer, 1 entree, 1 dessert) with quite a few choices in the three categories for $16.99. My fiancé got it and ordered the pan-seared pot stickers (dumplings), chicken and shrimp carbonara, and chocolate peanut butter pie. Andrew (my fiancé) enjoyed all three courses of his meal as well. He seemed to love the pasta.  I got the 2 for $10 deal, an appetizer and an entree or and entree and a dessert. I chose the Friday's shrimp and vanilla bean cheesecake. My food was delicious. Twelve lightly breaded shrimp with seasoned French fries. Ive tried breaded shrimp at many locations and have little to no flavor. Friday's shrimp is wonderful. The flavor is great and would be my favorite of anywhere.  The cheesecake was a big deal. I don't even bother ordering cheesecake anywhere, jello cheesecake from the box is the best in the world to me. Most places are thick and heavy and just taste...artificial to me. Upon the waitresses descriptive encouragement to give it a try, I did. People, this cheesecake is so delicious its not even funny. It has a whipped topping layer adorned with white chocolate shavings then a layer of a vanilla bean filling. It's out of this world.  The best part was when we got out check and saw how much money we saved by ordering with those deals. We saved over twenty dollars. Our desserts on their own would have been almost $6 each. For less than my entrees originally price I got that same entree cheaper and a practically free dessert. It's crazy. So my advice would be make sure you choose those deals, they're good and save you lots of money. Unless you're a big spender, don't skip out. Our meal would have been over $50 total.  Just another note, they seem to have taken the more upscale view on their dishes, they're artfully set up and are pleasing to the eye. The desserts were served on long white plates with chocolate and peanut butter syrup drizzles and strawberries. Just pretty to look at.  Overall great experience, we will be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greensburg,,,,,
12,Mon H.,"Akron, OH",16,3,1.0,1.0,2012-11-02,"Server was lazy and slow, not attentive either. Cleanliness was horrible and they were not very busy, there was not a wait or anything.  We got our appetizer and i could not believe how small it was, it was loaded chips in a skillet. Either someone portioned it wrong or TGIF is a stingy company.  The new Jack Daniel's burger bun was dryed out and crumby, and the Whiskey cake had a horrible mouth-feel, it was very crumbly and almost dried out for being smothered in a caramel sauce.  I will not go back here and would suggest no one else waste their time when there are many other places that are much better. this was a real disappointment.  P.S I think the other reviews on here is someone being paid to write reviews. They just seem very general and very made up. I also contacted the company and got a nice automated message to write yet another email to the company. So I am not wasting my time and instead writing on here so BUYER BEWARE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greensburg,,,,,
10,Mindy L.,"Connellsville, PA",7,30,14.0,3.0,2014-03-25,Went to dinner with a friend. It'd been a while since I had been there for dinner. Had the Jack Daniels Salmon with fresh vegetables. The salmon was very good as usual. The fresh vegetables was seasoned with Cajun seasoning which was terrible. Fresh vegetables should be just that fresh vegetables. They added a piece of corn bread with dinner. But it could've been plain cornbread it was  jalapeno cornbread. I think plain cornbread would  please more people. They did bring me steamed broccoli when I said I was not pleased with the vegetables. My friend Had the Jack Daniels ribs which she said was very good. Anything in the Jack Daniels sauce I think is very good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greensburg,,,,,
7,Mackenzie K.,"Alexandria, VA",457,282,583.0,4.0,2014-12-28,"Typical Friday's, but I wish they would remodel this one a little better, feels empty and not warm & inviting. Staff is nice and they are open late to serve food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greensburg,,,,,
3,Maria J.,"Pittsburgh, PA",120,240,1423.0,3.0,2015-05-29,"I have never really been impressed with any TGI Fridays but my meal here was better than others I have had. Friday's reminds me of Applebee's and has standard bar type food so if you are hungry, it gets the job done. I much prefer Texas Roadhouse which is right next door.  The turkey burger was good and I would get it again since I like turkey burgers. The fries also had good flavoring.  Very clean. Fast service .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greensburg,,,,,
6,Damaris S.,"Greensburg, PA",26,12,6.0,4.0,2015-12-12,"TGI Fridays has recently renovated & mostly the changes consist of taking the ""TGI"" off the front awning & removing the cluttered antiques from the interior walls. The menue seems to be the exact same and the Jack Daniels chicken entrée was delicious as usual. My partner said his burger was dry, and we were both unhappy with the Loaded Potato appetizer. The potato skins were fried in a fryer and had a dollop of liquid type cheese on top & mostly tasted like grease.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greensburg,,,,,
8,Gabrielle S.,"Bristol, PA",3,108,,3.0,2016-04-20,"First time to this one, and our first time to a Friday's in ages. It was okay, I noticed the prices went up drastically. The quality isn't worth the price I mean afterall it's Friday's. Our server was okay, a little slow but good. The food took forever, as usual and same as every other Friday I've been too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greensburg,,,,,
5,Julie S.,"Greensburg, PA",0,10,,5.0,2016-12-30,BEST FRIDAYS IN THE PITTSBURGH AREA.  Never a bad experience.  Only thing I wish about this Fridays you tell them you're a Friday's rewards member and they don't give the chips and salsa like they should.  I go here multi times a month and I only got chips from this Fridays once...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greensburg,,,,,
1,Deborah N.,"Greensburg, PA",28,231,420.0,3.0,2017-01-27,"Sometimes, I forget that this restaurant is an option.  After a busy morning, I stopped here for lunch, before heading to Lowes.   The lunch specials are very reasonably priced, but husband and I picked items not on the regular lunch menu.  I enjoyed my house salad with balsamic vinaigrette along with some chicken tenders.  My husband was happy with his Jack Daniels hamburger and side of mac and cheese.  The server we had was friendly and accommodating.      Upon arriving, the dining room wasn't too busy, but by the time we left, it had become to fill up.  I guess others like their lunch menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greensburg,,,,,
4,Lauren E.,"Vancouver, Canada",70,28,9.0,5.0,2017-02-11,"My husband and I came in for the first time today. We had never been to a TGI Friday's before ever. We actually decided to come because we were at Walmart picking up a few things and saw their mozzarella sticks in the frozen aisle and thought they looked good...lol.  I rarely write 5 star reviews. I like to be honest, and I will be the first to admit that I'm a huge food snob, coming from the food capitol of the world, in my opinion (after traveling the world), Vancouver, Canada. But honestly, this 5 star review was well deserved, not necessarily for the food, but for the quality of service given.  It's hard to find good service in Greensburg. It's a pretty dead-beat town with nothing to do for anyone under the age of 55. There aren't any good restaurants (no offense), and the people are generally unmotivated and just lacking. This TGI Friday's however, gave me a bit of hope for the most boring city I've ever lived in.  Our waiter, Isaac (sorry if I spelled your name wrong or got it wrong...) was extremely polite, tried his best, and was working hard to make sure the customers were satisfied and had a good experience. He was charming, well-mannered, and efficient. There was another male waiter we noticed working at the tables around us (and also picked up some of our plates) that was working just as hard and was just as polite and efficient. This is RARE to see in the Greensburg area. These two gentlemen in particular were not treating their job as somewhere to clock in, get paid, and go home, but were representing the company well and never let our water get even half empty without replacing it or at least offering to. Thank you for the great experience, because of this, we will be back. As for the food, the mozzarella sticks are probably the best I've ever had. Most mozzarella sticks (yes, I'm talking to you, Sheetz) are 80% batter and 20% cheese, however this restaurant's mozzarella sticks are about 80% cheese and 20% batter OR LESS! They were great. The marinara was also extremely good (or so I heard from my husband....I'm allergic to tomatoes )= ). The rest of the food (wings, sushi roll) were extremely sub-par, but that didn't matter much, honestly we weren't expecting a 5-star meal from TGIF. It was also refreshing to hear that they were removing the sushi roll off the menu since it wasn't really working for them. I know some chain restaurants just don't care what the census is on their product because of pride issues. The brownie however, was amazing. We were legitimately considering ordering a second brownie had it not been for the fact that we would have looked like complete fat-asses.  Anyway, TL;DR, we will be back for the mozzarella sticks, brownie, and good service. This place is being managed very well, and please, for the love of all things good, tip your staff well when deserved. It's hard to find good service in this state.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greensburg,,,,,

2,Jessica H.,"Connellsville, PA",17,1,,1.0,2017-10-01,"First time I've been here and it will be the last time. Our waitress Laura seemed very snobby and uninterested in us. I order a strawberry daiquiri and it took her about 15 minutes to get it. Need I remind you the bartender wasn't busy and neither was the place. Maybe about 8 tables in the whole restaurant. I then spotted her sitting down numerous amounts of time on a couple different occasions with another coworker of hers that seemed to be on her break. I thanked her when she would bring stuff to my table but I wasn't even welcomed or even got a smile out of her. Food was good, but my ribs were a little overdone. I overheard the bartender Bruce flirting with a worker that was on the end of her shift. Total sexual harassment because she didn't seemed to enthused about it as he was making passes at her. Never going here ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greensburg,,,,,
