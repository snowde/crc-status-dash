14,Regan M.,"Irmo, SC",0,8,12.0,2.0,2012-06-28,"Meh.  I got a Ribeye, garlic Parmesan steak fries and a mozzarella/tomato salad.  The ribeye was tough and lacked flavor.  The Parmesan fries were crisp, but only had two or three sprigs of Parmesan.  I was excited about the mozzarella and tomato salad option because I freakin' LOVE mozzarella, but even that wasn't very good.  How do you screw up fresh mozzarella?  My husband got the Jack Daniels Ribs- which he LOVES the sauce and he LOVES ribs.  These came with some plain fried shrimp.  He liked the shrimp better than the ribs.  We could have gotten fried shrimp ANYWHERE!!  And for way less than $25.   On the positive side, it was kids eat free night and the kiddos aren't too picky.  They enjoyed it, even if the grumps didn't.  The service was average and I saw waitresses bossing other waitresses around and talking sassy.  Overall it was a sub-par experience.  We won't be returning...even if the kids do eat free.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greenville-2?start=20,1.8,1.8,1.8,1.8,1.8000000000000003

The parking lot is always full so we thought they must be doing something right. First of all, you can't go wrong with the crispy fried green beans. Such a guilty pleasure - awesome flavor, not greasy at all, and I love the cucumber wasabi dip. Second, you can get an appetizer and entree for $10. Yes, $10, and the entree is not half size, it's extremely full sized. The Korean tacos are delicious. They serve you three soft tacos stuffed full of tender marinated beef, along with greens, diced cucumber and carrots that have been marinated in an asian dressing, along with a serving of savory jasmine rice. I was really surprised at how good this was. My husband had the seafood pasta, which he said was equally as impressive.

There was dirt all over the floor, the large toilet paper roll was on the dirty floor, beside the toilet, and they had pieces of torn toilet paper on the roll holder to be used.

38,Katalina S.,"Atlanta, GA",0,28,14.0,1.0,2015-09-19,"Ok, so I have been to this Friday's several times. I've had varied experiences - mostly, not good. One time, the bartender basically stole my friend's phone. She left it on the counter and the bartender put it in his pocket and ""forgot"" to give it to management. The last experience, however, absolutely took the cake. My family and I went for my sister's birthday celebration. My mother called ahead about 30 minutes before to let them know we'd have about 7 people. The guy she spoke with said it would not be a problem and that there was no wait. We get there, the hostess was incredibly rude and suddenly, within that 30 minute time period, there was an hour wait? Ok,fine. We wait. They ended up putting us in two separate booths that were beside each other. The waitress comes and our party inquires about the endless appetizers deal. My mother specifically asked her if the deal was for the boneless wings only and she said, ""No, you can get bone-in wings."" So we got that and one other appetizer. The waitress comes back time and time again to ask if we want refills for the appetizers. The bill comes and she had charged us each time for every refill, not to mention the wings were charged at full price. We politely inquired about the bill and she begins to LIE saying she never said the bone-in wings were in the endless apps. Um, what? I couldn't believe she lied in front of 7 people who clearly heard her say they were. She proceeds to go on saying that each refill was charged because we shared the appetizers among everybody at the table.  Now if that is a stipulation for the promotion, that would have been fine! Except she never said we couldn't share. Every other table around us were doing the same thing and why would she come around several times to ask about refills if she knew she was going to charge us each time?? She begin to get extremely rude and got an attitude with my mother. Of course we ask for the manager, who eventually took the charges for the refills off. My mom attempted to contact their GM with no response, at all. Horrible customer service, period. Also I should mention the service before the billing fiasco was terrible. She never came to clear the table and we were basically having to put dirty plates on the ledge above us to make room. We had to ask for refills. And the utensils were filthy! Needless to say, none of us will be back here. Horrible experience that is NOT worth your coins!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greenville-2,,,,,

The manager delivered our food to the table and said this unacceptable. Oh really do you think. Well I get my bill and guess what? Right no adjustment, no deserts offered not even a real apology. I am in the food business in management and this manager is horrible. I can say this I will never step foot back in this place ever again.

41,Joey K.,"Tampa, FL",1,38,12.0,2.0,2016-02-08,"I used to really like Friday's, particularly for their bruschetta chicken pasta. It was my guilty pleasure that I indulged in two or three times a year. They changed it drastically, which tweaks me to no end. I don't restaurant very often, but there are those favorite haunts that I go to when I want a hearty meal-invariably, they decide to mess with the one platter I love just as it is. I forgave them long ago for removing the garlic grilled bread that accompanied the pasta dish, even though, uh, that means the dish is no longer bruschetta, it's pretty much spaghetti with chicken because of that. What remained was still delish-angel hair pasta, a light tomato salsa, balsamic glaze, garlic, and parmesan cheese. A comforting blend of flavors. I guess they had to intervene again and make it...gross. Now it's a gummy mess of overcooked linguine pasta, sticky bland sauce, and chicken that seems boiled or microwaved, not grilled. Balsamic glaze was absent. No real discernible garlic flavor, much less one identifiable sliver of garlic. No parm. I don't know why Friday's hates me so, but they obviously do. I don't want to try another dish and be equally disappointed. Will have to find a new flavorful pasta bomb at another business. *sigh* Gave an extra star for the servers, though.

It was ok. Slightly dry. The ranch has a very strange taste to it. I ordered the smaller portion of the shrimp and chicken Cajun pasta. It was the perfect size. Peppers and onions went well with it. I added black pepper to it as well as tobacco sauce and it all tasted good. My husband got the jack Daniels chicken and he liked it a lot. The spinach that came with it were cooked good. The mashed potatoes were ok but tasted fake.  I have two complaints about this place- 1-they have advertised drinks on their table displays but actually don't have it. They had several beer options on the list but don't actually serve it. Not because they are sold out but because they just don't have it. The part that is messed up is that they advertise these beer specials at a certain price but won't honor a substitute.  2-My friend is 28 years old and had a valid updated SC drivers license. They would NOT honor it and she could not drink!!! She has a vertical SC id and they told her because it said at the bottom that she has been 21 since 2010 that she could easily give this to her sister so her sister can drink. I kid you not. We asked to speak to the manager and she said that it was a corporate thing. I can tell she really hated telling us this because I'm sure they experience this all the time!

I got the pecan crusted chicken salad it was just ok I wouldn't order it again. But the mashed potatoes and the appetizer yes!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greenville-2,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
33,Jayne C.,"Atlanta, GA",0,8,,4.0,2017-02-03,"Not sure what the complaints are about. Ate here passing through and had the same great experience that I have at any Friday's I've ever gone to. Food was fast, hot, and tasty. Service was amicable. What more do I need for a quickie lunch?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greenville-2,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12

25,Jasmine B.,"Charlotte, NC",80,281,161.0,4.0,2017-05-17,"Had no issues at this TGI Fridays. Only issue is the traffic on the street that this location sits on. Waiter was good, very attentive. Food was great. We even ordered then placed another order for an entree. Didn't have to wait long for the food, which was a plus, as we were starving. My daughter and I both had ribs. Jack Daniels and BBQ ribs + fries with honey mustard.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greenville-2,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
31,Brooklyn K.,"Anderson, SC",0,4,,2.0,2017-07-29,"Food was good. But, that's where it ends. Our waitress has been pretty much non-existent. We had to flag another one to get a tea refill. We have now been sitting for a good 15 mins watching her chit chat with friends at another table. Then when she finished we thought surely she will come bring our check. No she went to get an order from another table. I'm fuming and tempted to get up and leave. Never will return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greenville-2,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
27,Michelle M.,"Easley, SC",9,89,270.0,3.0,2017-09-10,"TGI Fridays wasn't my choice for dinner today, but I went along with the crowd. It wasn't to busy, and we didn't have to wait that long to be seated. TGI Fridays is in serious need of some new menus or invest in some that can be wiped off, my menu was sticky. I had a strawberry lemonade slush to go with my meal(you do get refills). I didn't get my usual appetizer today, the Jack Sesame Chicken strips, but ordered the Chicken Quesadilla instead. For my main meal I played it safe again and ordered the chicken tender platter. I know I know I'm not that adventurous when it comes to food, but one day I just might be!! The strawberry lemonade slush is a really tasty drink, with A LOT of crushed ice, that waters the drink down really fast, so you need to drink it before it loses its flavor. The chicken quesadilla I liked,with all of its cheddar cheese, chicken in crispy tortilla wedges and salsa to dip them in. The chicken tender platter comes with fries and honey mustard dipping sauce. The tenders were fried too crispy, and were just ok. On my next adventure to TGI Friday, I just might have appetizers for my main meal, the Jack Sesame Strips and the Chicken Quesadillas!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greenville-2,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24

The salads are huge, tasty and pleasurable to the eye. Chicken with cheese was hot and delicious. The only miss was the boneless wings-too much breading and not enough sauce.
