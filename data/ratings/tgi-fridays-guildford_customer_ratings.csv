2,Abe K.,"Tübingen, Germany",12,13,33,1.0,2014-08-08,"Where's the worst restaraunt in Guildford? This is! Well, why is this restaraunt the worst? The following points will enlighten you: 1. The decor was bleak with very dim lighting. 2. Tables were sticky, even after telling the waiter, who was in a bad mood, nothing changed. 3. The food was obviously microwaved and yesterday's. It wasn't fresh by any stretch of the imagination. 4. It was really warm inside the restaraunt, making our experience that more terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-guildford,,,,,
