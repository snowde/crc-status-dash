1,Philip M.,"Long Beach, MS",0,5,,2.0,2012-01-25,"I've been eating here for eight years, and have noticed a rapid decline in food quality. Friday's seems to be cutting a few corners , possibly to parallel the economy. I ordered a pasta dish last week. Service was excellent, but bread sticks with pasta is now completely unheard of at TGIF's. Won't be eating there again for a while. Chili's is right next door..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gulfport?start=40,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088
38,Caroline W.,"Slidell, LA",4,108,16.0,2.0,2012-06-20,"Had a choice between Fridays and the Texas steakhouse and decided it had been a long time since we had eaten at this restaurant.  It was 9.30pm on a Saturday night and it was not overly busy, we were asked if we would like to sit at the bar which we declined which later we were glad of this decision.  The young lady who served our table was pleasant and polite but seemed to have a lot of tables to wait on.  Food was passable but there are better places to eat.  I like bars but worry that this restaurant has been taken over by the bar, watched one couple who appeared very embarrassed by the loud guys who were eating at the bar, the guys were encouraged by one of the bartenders and at one point it sounded like there were hogs at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gulfport?start=20,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056

34,JD H.,"Lynnwood, WA",33,7,1.0,2.0,2014-03-08,"Well we were seated promptly on a Saturday night which was surprising. Service during the meal was mediocre at best as our waitress did not provide us with silverware and checked in only twice and that's including check drop off. Now to the food, because that's what we care about. I had the Sirloin and ordered it medium rare. I received the steak and found that it was very tough and gritty. It was dry and overcooked. My wife ordered the salmon and it was also dry not to mention the cast iron plate it was seated on was cold so we knew it was in the window for a while. I would tell people to go across the street to longhorns or the Cracker Barrel.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gulfport?start=20,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000004
0,Wynter R.,"Moss Point, MS",40,7,5.0,1.0,2014-03-19,"The one and only nice thing I have to say about my lunch experience with my husband today was that we were seated promptly by the hostess. It was downhill from there. When drink orders were brought to the table the waitress Jessica sloshed tea all over both myself and the table.  Rather than apologise and clean it up she just stares at it like it just magically appeared all over the place. She then just looked away and walked off. I cleaned it up myself. Next when the food arrived I noticed that the au jus for my French dip looked funny. That would be because it was French onion soup so thick that it would't even pour out of the ramekin. When I asked I was told this is how it is served. Since I don't like French onion soup, and the sandwich was to dry to eat otherwise I gave it to my husband and decided to just eat my salad. Bad Idea. I mixed up my salad and took a bite. I was greeted with absolute nastiness. Rather than a normal salad some one had grabbed a Caesar salad complete with dressing and poured my blue cheese dressing on top. It was bad. When I called over the waitress and showed her she said and I quote  "" Well what do you want, a fresh salad?""  It was at this point that I had to remind myself that I am an adult and yelling on public is childish. I simply told her yes. When the  salad came out she just set it on the table and walked off. The hostess then spills her drink right next to the hostess station (right next to our table) and rather than mop it up unrolls an entire roll of paper towels on top of it. I was surprised at the level of apathy and sheer laziness of the front of house staff. It is time for one of two things Friday's,  retrain your staff or cull the heard. Either way we will not be back for quite a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gulfport?start=40,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000005

Well today was Fathers Day and our waitress has dropped the ball several times. No silverware, we had to get our own, no water when we asked for it, she never made eye contact, it was like she was in another world. Terrible service. When we commented on how bad the service was, she acted surprised. I told her that the Resturant had really gone down since our last visit -one year ago. We also pointed out all of the mistakes she kept making -and she was pretty flippant about our concerns. She said ""I'll talk to my manager"" - she returned saying that they had taken 20% off the bill -my husband gave her a $100 dollar bill -and we waited for our change and a copy of the bill. She returned with our change and walk off. We looked at each other and said in unison ""where is the bill?"" We had to flag her down again -we said we want a copy of the bill for our records. She said ok -when she came back with the bill -the bill had all of the original charges without, the removal of any percentage as she had stated. We realized that Ms. Courtney would be taking the 20% off after we left.

We got the pulled pork, tuna wonton, meatball, bruschetta, and steak hibachi skewers. Everything was disgusting except the bruschetta. Meatballs was super salty and steak hibachi was like chewing on jerky. It was over cooked. The pulled pork was a fail and the tuna wonton had no flavor all you could taste was wasabi.

20,Jason W.,"Omaha, NE",5,55,,1.0,2014-12-22,"Never again. The co-workers decided on Fridays.  I tried the turkey sandwich with fries.  The sandwich was tiny.  I mean, comparable to a simple McDonald's hamburger bun.  The turkey - well, I've had more food caught in my beard after drunken stops at Waffle House.  Seriously, it was smaller than a single piece of folded pre-packaged sliced turkey you'd find at your local grocery store.  The fries were cold and soggy.  I didn't get my side of potato soup that was ordered with the meal. Nobody here (~12 people) was happy with the food.  One co-worker took a spoonful of her broccoli soup and immediately threw the entire container in the trash, saying it tasted rotten and like plastic. On top of all of that nonsense, the price was quite high, even for normal portions, but considering how tiny the portions were, we were quite surprised.

The updated menu is a little overwhelming--so I am glad they had a lunch menu. Although smaller, it still provided plenty of options. My husband ordered a burger and parmesan fries and I did the pick 2 with bruschetta and soup. The soup and fries were great. The bruschetta was soft--which was weird since I expect crunchy/toasted bread with that and they piled the tomatoes on a bit too much. My husband liked his burger, but it didn't seem like anything special. It was decent food, but nothing great or special. The lunch prices are good though--I don't think we would eat here for dinner.

We waited  10 minutes for an attendant to ask for our drink order, over 25 minutes for a salad so small it could have fit in a shot glass,  50 minutes for our entrées and then the shock came. The food was in such small portions a child could have finished it within minutes. My husband's steak, we ordered medium, came out burned, overcooked and dry as could be. The ""lobster sauce"" I ordered on the side contained 6 little tails which resembled crawfish ,green peppers and gunk held it together. I cannot express how angry I am at the complete neglect the staff showed for our party and the level of disrespectful we were shown.

I placed a To-Go order and got hung up on in the middle of a question. Had to go to the bar to pick up my order and since no one wanted to be bothered to assist me I entertained myself watching the fruit flies hover about the drink nozzles and timing how long it took for my elbows to unstick from the bar top.They got my order wrong and I was scared to eat after I pointed it out to them.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gulfport?start=20,,,,,
16,Nick W.,"Lafayette, LA",0,6,7.0,2.0,2015-09-01,"Tried eating out here around 11 at night, food wasn't anything special. Ordered the hibachi chicken skewers with hibachi chicken and broccoli. The chicken was cooked poorly (was dry and smothered in barbecue sauce) the skewers had no vegetables on them at all though, broccoli was steamed, no seasoning or anything so was pretty bland IMO, the jasmine rice was probably my favorite part of the meal. Oh and my pita bread was actually burnt on the underside. Ordered a Kamikaze to drink (vodka, triple sec, lime juice) but had way too much lime to really enjoy it. The service was poor. I sat at the bar but the bartender only came around twice in my time (took my order and gave a drink refil) I had to keep tapping the shoulders of other waitress' passing to get help for salt or a refill of coke or anything else that being said, all the waitress' were extremely friendly, this bothered me the most I think as a Bartender myself.

She got the mahi mahi naan sandwich, which was also good. Now to the part of the meal that earned them a 2 star rating. I would like to title it ""Would you like a little salad with that dressing?"" I got the Strawberry Fields salad. To begin with, it was pitifully small for an almost $9 salad. Then there's the dressing. The salad was literally swimming in it. There had to have been 1/2-3/4 of a cup of dressing on this salad. Even though I considered the salad small, I just couldn't finish it dressed like it was.

They were ok, all tasted about the same. Not sure if it's just at this location or something new tgi's is doing, but we got a free app of chips and salsa for being stripes members!

By the time it arrived we were pretty full from the fries, so boxed it up to take home. Overall the hostess was definitely the shining star! Service was good. Food and drinks were good. Btw....

7,Jen T.,"Gulfport, MS",134,273,487.0,2.0,2016-07-07,I am not a TGIF regular. I think I have been once in California. Met a girlfriend for drinks/dinner. It was 6:15 when I arrived and it wasn't busy at all. That always worries me lol but I went in and from the beginning everyone was really nice. My friend was already there waiting and I was greeted almost immediately by our server. We started with the tostada app ($11) and we waited to order our entree for a little while. As we chatted we did enjoy the tostadas but I thought there was minimal chicken and too much sauce. It's basically three tostada shells halved and topped. I think is was good just needed to be beefed up a bit. Could be a great entree if it had more stuff on it. So I ended up ordering the Mahi Mahi sandwich and let's just get right to it. It was not good. It looked amazing on the menu- I will include my sandwich and a menu sandwich picture. My fish was very fishy (gross) and the flavor in the bread were just icky. It also came on pita bread?? I hate pita bread. It was called naan bread and I don't know what that is but I really just can't say one thing good about the whole entree. My fries came out in a paper bag and were not fresh so they went back. The manager was so friendly and I appreciate it. Once I sent the fries back and bit into the fish I decided I wasn't going to flag him down again. I was visiting an old friend from work and just wanted to have a nice visit.  I more then likely won't be back but I do appreciate the good service.  *****just look at my sandwich and compare it to the menu picture******* WOW!!!!!

We walked in and the hostess asked if we could sit in the bar section since they were beginning their rotation. Didn't have the slightest idea what she was talking about and we don't like sitting near the bar but went ahead and did it so they could rotate. I ordered the burger, medium. The waitress alerted me that sometimes it's too rare for most prople and should it be cooked well. I asked her if it was premium beef and she said yes. It also asked if it was pink inside and she said yes so I went with it. Well low and behold she brought the burger and at the first bite I thought I heard it moo. If I had a bandaid I could have saved it's life.  My wife ordered a strawberry salad with grilled chicken and ranch dressing. After I finished killing the burger the salad came out late. She told the server that she ordered her dressing, ranch, on the side. Her salad came with vinegarette already on the salad and no ranch. She took it back and told us that someone else had taken her salad and they would have to make another. After finishing my cow her salad came and she discovered that there were no pecans in it. Again the alert went out and the pecans delivered with the excuse that the salad maker was new. The mamager came by and I told him about the issues which he apologized for. All in all our experience sucked. We were on our way to Pensecola and stopped there for lunch. I will make a note to make sure we don't ever stop again.

The quality of food is over priced! We will not be returning!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gulfport,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
4,Jenna M.,"Baton Rouge, LA",41,65,113.0,4.0,2017-05-28,First time to this one and it was pretty good. The bathrooms were well kept and the food came out quick and fresh. The only hiccup was when the waiter took my water to refill it and forgot to bring it back. It was alright though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gulfport,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
21,Dianne G.,"Gilbertown, AL",0,7,,1.0,2017-05-31,"We had a really nasty waitress Danielle and we ask for our ticket and a box and waited for over a hour.  She was very rude. And when I went to management about it, she was like it was ok. We have been here several times before and have never been treated like we were tonight. We will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gulfport,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
18,CaSaundra M.,"Gulfport, MS",0,5,,5.0,2017-06-20,"This place is one of the better chain restaurants in Gulfport in my opinion. The staff was very friendly, we received our food in a reasonable amount of time, the food was served to us hot, fresh, and delicious and the waitress stayed on top of drink refills. This was a great experience and I would gladly return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gulfport,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
23,Amber D.,"Lake Worth, TX",48,24,12.0,2.0,2017-07-13,"Service was rrrrreeeeeaaaaalllllyyyyyy slow..... I bet we spent 2 hours or more there from start to finish. We didn't order any well done steaks or anything that would take a while to fix. Which I would have understood if it was at a prime time that we went in, like Friday night dinner rush, or we ordered 4 well done steaks, but it wasn't, and we didn't. All we ordered was soup/salad, kids pasta, and two endless apps. Easy peasy. But for some reason it all took an insane amount of time. We went in late, probably close to 9:30. Maybe the kitchen had cut a lot of their cooks. Who knows. I had asked for my soup out before the rest of the food, which it didn't come out first, and when it was brought out it was cold. I didn't say anything because we had waited a good 25-30 min for everything and was just ready to eat and leave at that point. Don't know if we'll be back. We went there only because they were open until 1 am and needed a ""quick"" late night dinner. Too bad it wasn't quick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gulfport?start=20,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
10,Christen D.,"Gulfport, MS",0,6,3.0,5.0,2017-07-14,We come here all the time before going to the movies and always sit at the bar. All of the bartenders are great and it's a nice atmosphere.

6,Holly S.,"Memphis, TN",16,13,,2.0,2017-10-01,We love Fridays but this was not a good experience....appetizer was wrong....the service was awful and took forever then when our order came out mine was wrong....they took my meal off the ticket because we were in a hurry and I didn't have time to return it and get something else...they should comped the whole meal as it took an hour and a half to get it but they still charged for my husband....lesson learned......won't go to this Friday's again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gulfport,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
5,April R.,"Ocean Springs, MS",31,6,9.0,1.0,2017-11-11,"We decided to chill tonight and order from Friday's via Waitr. We received a message that the delivery driver was on his way and he got here in less than 5 minutes. Unfortunately, our food was a disaster. The food was old and cold. I can't believe they allowed this to leave their kitchen, much less their restaurant. Very disappointing. Judge for yourselves...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gulfport,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
