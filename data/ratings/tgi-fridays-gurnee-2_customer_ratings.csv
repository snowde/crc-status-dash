72,Edwin M.,"Gurnee, IL",0,59,1.0,2.0,2012-09-30,"TGI Friday's used to be my favorite casual restaurant chain.  Back when I traveled heavily for work (in the late 90s), I would often seek out a Friday's location for those times when I just felt like having something good and reliable.  It seems that at some point, they changed and are now simply average and barely so. For some unknown reason, they removed the host podium.  This creates a rather awkward situation when entering the restaurant as there is no longer a defined place to go to ask for a table.  The last time I went, I was the only one waiting and an employee was on the phone.  I waited for him to finish up and at least acknowledge my presence, but he just hung up and left.  So, now I am left standing there with no one around and no indication of when someone would return.  I suppose that I could have eaten at the bar, but there were a few loud and obnoxious groups already in there and I wasn't in the mood.  I wound up leaving and dining elsewhere. I probably wouldn't have bothered writing a review except for the fact that this isn't the first time this has happened and other experiences at this restaurant have rubbed me the wrong way as well.  Hopefully, they can pull themselves out of their current downward spiral, but until then I will be making extremely rare appearances here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gurnee-2?start=60,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006

Service was quick and friendly.  Food was made to order and portions were substantial.  I had the always delicious Jack Daniel's burger and my wife had a seafood pasta dish which smelled like a dumpster (nobody ever says, MMMMMmmmmmmmmmm...smells like fish in a positive way), but was extremely tasty. Kids meals are varied and mandarin oranges are an optional side.

81,Jill B.,"Gurnee, IL",0,14,,2.0,2013-01-01,"My husband and I were so hyped up to go to Friday's on a Friday. Came hungry, waited as expected, no biggie. We ended up being kinda disappointed by all the ""safe"" options on the menu as I would call them. Pretty much means something I could easily make myself at home and wouldn't care to order when out to eat. So, I ordered the chicken piccata pasta dish, which sounded great and cool since its a spin on one of my favorite dishes. My husband ordered the appitizer plater (should have realized ahead of time that was an obvious mistake). The pasta dish literally looked like a noodle soup when it came. It tasted fine, just incredibly soupy and I soon regretted not sending it back. My husband said several time that if he had bought the Friday's brand freezer food at the grocery store and baked them himself, they would have been significantly better than what he got at the restaurant. That's real sad. Our server, he was super awesome, and attentive. He could tell we were dissatisfied, even though we weren't keen at all on making a stink. When we turned down the to-go boxes, he made a point to ask what had been lacking. I politely explained how the dishes missed the mark in a few ways. So, I'd say, everything was good or great, except the food. The food kinda sucked. I always thought the advantage to chains is consistency and control of flavor.

It's quite busy and very popular with families and boozers who want to whoop it up barside. The food is fine, the drinks are fine, and the service is a bit slow. What really gives me pause about the place is having to wait to get a table on a weeknight because there are so many families with kids. It's not really a good value if you have drinks. I'm skeptical about casual dining establishments which don't print prices for drinks on the menu. Beware of this practice. Two house margaritas and a special value entree with appetizer and entree with dessert had my total bill with tip upwards of $40 just for me. I want more for my money.

Fortunately for us, we ended up with a guy named John as our server and everything went uphill from there. Our server, John, didn't do anything crazy like blow up balloon animals or breathe fire. What he did was better. He was attentive, informative, intelligent about the food, casually inviting during our experience and engaged our 3 year old like a seasoned pro.  We recently moved to the area and have been eating out a lot lately. We've encountered an array of mediocre and sub-par service wherever we've gone, unfortunately. Last night, we chose Fridays on a passing whim and I'm glad we did.  Our food was pretty tasty; we appreciated the reduction in meal sizes from the last time we visited a Fridays. Despite a couple of small ""meh"" things (menus were dirty and my beverage tasted flat like the tap line wasn't clean) - it was all overshadowed by John's awesome.  Even watching his interactions with the other tables around us reaffirmed how good he is at what he does - which is make their Fridays experience a memorable one.

Friday's is my go-to place for a good meal and some drinks on special. Mondays and Wednesdays are my favorite days to go for drinks because they've got a lot of good drinks for only $3 that are normally around $8. Today I had a couple appletinis which were made very well - not too strong nor too sweet.  Whenever I go to Friday's, I usually order their 6oz. sirloin steak. For only $11 and two sides, this is a great meal! I always ask for my steak medium rare, but it always comes back a little more medium (which I don't mind). It's still better than a lot of places that serve steak and you're not really breaking your wallet here. My servers are always super nice, and I've never waited long for a seat when it's crowded (max: 15 minutes). In all my time coming here, I've only ever had one bad server. He was rude and forgot about my table constantly.  Today, I was just there for drinks and an appetizer. During the week, they've got appetizers on special when you eat at the bar. Their bar area has booths, which is really nice! I had the bacon wrapped jalapeños. I liked them although they were somewhat bland. The bacon was really sweet and it was only $5. When my server handed me the receipt, he made a mistake of charging my appetizer full price. When I brought it up, he was really sorry. This has happened to me twice at this location, but the other time was ages ago.  They've got Bingo on Sundays, which is always a hoot.

I have a fairly high tolerance for alcohol and one drink got me buzzed.  If like to start by saying that I think there should be a better method for the all you can eat APPS. They would have to charge my two children (10,and 4) $12 each to share the endless appetizers. I understand why there's a rule. But really, my kids don't eat much. Maybe a few bites. It was cheaper for me to just order two separate appetizers (and we didn't even eat them all). It'd be wonderful if they maybe did a $5 charge for kids instead of full price.  Anyway, onto the food.  Spinach dip- Good. Better than others.  Pretzel w cheese dip- bland. Disappointing.  New York Strip- Under seasoned, lacked flavor, and quality. Was cooked correctly.  Mozzarella & Tomatoes- good.  Fresh Spinach- Good.  Burger- asked for it cooked medium and it literally came back burnt. No, seriously. Burnt. They made a new one. Daughter enjoyed the second.  Brownie Sundae- Really Good.

I was quick to correct him in his unnecessary statements towards us. No employee ever bothered to come clean the mess that a few customers continued to step on and over. No employee came to offer anyone an apology. I had to ask for another jack Daniels sauce and when I did ask I was given unnecessary negative attitude by the waiter. At one point I saw his eyes roll.

(I will try and post a photo).   As for the meal let's start with the easiest thing to prepare: pot stickers, they were dry and shriveled in appearance - either over nuked or sat in the window too long. There was no sear on the bottom and was discolored almost as if they spilled some of the sauce on them while it sat in the window. The wings were okay but most of the sauce was on the plate and not tossed properly.  The parmesan crusted chicken was rubbery / fleshy in texture and had an odd taste. It wasn't spoiled it just had odd flavors.  The chicken fingers were stringy, salty, and dry. I'm assuming they no longer hand batter them to order anymore. They had the texture, taste, and appearance of being prepared and frozen.  I mean this whole heartidly I serioulsy wished we went to Wendy's. The meal would have been so much better. Never again will this restaurant be an option under any circumstances. Our waiter Jordan (I think) was very attentive and polite - he was the only positive part of the meal. We still tipped him well.

8,Hallie C.,"Gurnee, IL",1,28,4.0,2.0,2017-11-12,"I love fridays and was extremely disappointed with this location.  Service was slow, our waitress was not good.  Food took forever to come out and mine had clearly been sitting under the heat lamps for a while since some of my noodles were crunchy.  My chicken was beyond dry and my daughters burgers were awful.  I would have complained but it was busy and my daughter was falling asleep at the table.  The manager was by the door while my husband and I were leaving with daughter in arms and he yelled at his staff to hold the door (loud enough where a customer thought he was talking to her!).  Awful experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gurnee-2,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16

We were supposed to get a full slab of rib for their half-price special, we only got a half slab of ribs. They completely missed the sides, ! 2 sides were completely missing on two of the four orders, and on a 3rd order they gave the wrong side.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gurnee-2,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
6,Kaye G.,"Grayslake, IL",20,3,,2.0,2017-12-01,"My husband and I typically love going to TGI Fridays, and usually, we dine in. Tonight, we both had a particularly long day and a longer night ahead of us so we decided to order carry out and we were very disappointed with our food. First of all, we ordered buffalo wings and they were basically inedible because each one was bloody inside. We also got two entrees: the grilled salmon and the 10oz sirloin. We asked for the rice to be substituted to the mashed potato for the salmon meal and we still got the rice and we asked for the sirloin to be medium rare and it was closer to well done than it was to medium. I'm not quite sure if it was because it was carry out that was the issue because we have never had this experience when dining it. It's a shame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gurnee-2,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
5,Eric S.,"Kenosha, WI",50,6,7.0,1.0,2017-12-09,Called ahead for call ahead seating. When there was no wait. Got here 10 minutes later to be told there's a 20 minute wait. No phone calls were taken around that time and they don't do call ahead. What a waste of a drive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gurnee-2,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
3,Tyler K.,"Lawrence, KS",0,2,,1.0,2017-12-12,Worst service ever! Been in there twice now and decided to leave both times due to their service. I would recommend not going to this location off of Grand at all costs!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gurnee-2,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08

Husband ordered a burger instead, had to take it home.  The poor girl is the one that had to say sorry 6 times. No credit.  Not busy at all. I have lived out in this area for a long time, WOW has it gone way down hill!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gurnee-2,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96
