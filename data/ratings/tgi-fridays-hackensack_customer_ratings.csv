63,Christine A.,"Alameda, CA",22,390,6.0,2.0,2012-02-10,"Average I suppose. As a TGIFs in general I would rate this one more of a D+.  When i dropped my napkin, instead of getting me a new one, they put it back next to me on the table. Really?  Anyway, the pork ribs are very tender n good. Shrimp is ok, spinach dip is ok.

78,James M.,"New York, NY",0,233,,3.0,2012-06-13,In a strange Location from RT 4 You see the sign that says for lease and then the Fridays sign. This is mis leading I think everyone thinks its shut atleast I did till today but its very well not.    Went for lunch with a large group that had reservations. The waiters and greeters treated us like we where a forighn group like they never saw a large group. They then tried to squeeze us in when the resturant was empty. After talking with someone we fixed that. We then order and it took nearly an hour for some of the dishes to come while others where done.  The menu is great and is better I find then a few years ago more selection and better quality food. The moral of this review is the SERVICE SUCKS AND IF YOU GO HOPE YOU HAVE ALOT OF PATIENCE cause 1 wait staff for a large group is OBSERD!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hackensack?start=80,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476

97,Lakeshia B.,"Silver Spring, MD",364,128,13.0,4.0,2012-07-23,"I am a big TGI Friday's fan but lets just say today was a great experience. Usually when I go in I don't interact much with the bartenders but on this day I had a great time. I decided to hit up the bar before classes started and had myself a pink punk cosmo, 2 apple martinis, 2 malibu bay breezes, and a TGI Friday's chicken sandwich. Everything was to perfection and my bartender, Dan, was excellent. He and the hostess (whose name I never caught) had me in stitches with jokes about Lady Gaga, Cher, Madonna, and us just interacting was great. Why do I like this place? Because it is conveniently located right down from the school I attend and the pricing isn't half bad. I find the service tends to leave much to be desired, but on this day it changed my mind. I usually hit this place up before 6 pm any given day of the week and so it's never crowded at the bar. The food is always on point and my orders very rarely need to be sent back or to be taken again. Overall, I am a satisfied customers with no complaint Here is a tip: Try the pink punk cosmo it has cotton candy in it LOL",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hackensack?start=60,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48

The bar staff is good, and most do make a very nice strong LIT, cap and cokes, etc. However DO NOT get any of the domestics here, for some reason they are ALWAYS flat and look like apple juice.

Our waiter, Angel, was one of the best waiters I have ever had.

I have been to other TGIFridays and always came out satisfied, no complaints. But this particular location, I will never return to. The service was slow, not as friendly nor respectful than I think it should have been. The food was by far the worst I've tried in this chain. My entree took about 40 minutes to come out after ordering, and it was definitely not as good as it sounded. Silverware wasn't as clean. Overall bad experience here, below average.

I couldn't believe how bad our service was last night, I went with 2 of my friends to eat there around 11 o'clock at night.. We were welcomed at the door and were seated immediately, place wasn't busy. Our waitress came took our drinks order and brought  the drinks after 10 minutes. Then we ordered the spinach dip to share, and that took another 20 minutes to come, we actually had to ask if our appetizer was coming.. Then she brought it after 5 minutes which makes me think she might have forgotten to put the order in. Anyway, the spin dip we had was just horrible, it's basically someone put it In the microwave and turned it on for a good ten minutes, IT WAS SO HARD and DRY.. We couldn't eat it.. Then we just kept waiting and waiting and waiting for our food while our waitress started cleaning the other tables and then moved the tables and started sweeping the floor, and I'm saying the waitress Yes.. Not the busboy or someone else.. It's the same waitress that was handling our food.  are you kidding me? finally came the food and it was like I said decent. The waitress hasn't checked on us once to see if we needed anything, she was in the back room the whole time after cleaning the floor and after we finished we had to ask the other waitress to bring us the check because we just wanted to get the heck out of this place. Our food took 40 minutes to come to the table and our waitress was so unprofessional, experience as a whole was unpleasant.

The food is okay, typical Friday's stuff. Last time I went I got the ribs and they were tolerable. The service started off badly with a waitress showing up saying, ""I don't know where your server is, so I guess I'll be taking care of you."" She was fine for the rest of the meal, but it just seemed unorganized. There's nothing special at all about this place.

The J Daniels is always the way to go and this time I just got the appetizer sampler with a side. Cheaper and get to try all the JD products. It's a nice last resort and I prefer it over applebees.

We decided to sit at the bar and see what happens. You would figure being sandwiched right in between two office buildings there would be a few more people. Bartender was friendly, not overbearing which is a good thing. Checked in on us as necessary to see how we were doing. Ordered some apps which were fantastic.

62,M S.,"Jersey City, NJ",36,28,3.0,1.0,2014-04-24,I normally would not give such a low rating but went here tonight and had an experience like non other. Drinks came in a reasonable time and appetizers were good. We were even impressed that they were not rushing us through our food. The issues started when our main courses came. Steaks were ordered medium and came well done. When I asked the server to have it redone he actually attempted to take just the steak back to the kitchen on a napkin and leave the mashed potatoes to get ice cold. By the time I got my meal everyone else had finished their food. The manager came over and apologized but when the bill arrived they actually had the nerve to charge me.

The service however was really great! From the moment we walked in  service was just really great. The greeter was a nice, courteous young man and our waiter was awesome and attentive! I see the other reviews are less than stellar so maybe, hopefully, they're trying, we did appetizers only because my boys know what they like so for us that was the way to go . They enjoyed the Jack Daniels strips, fries and mozzarella sticks. Yes - maybe stick to what you know here. Nachos were also good and our waiter - so sorry I forgot his name- I have to stop doing that for yelp's sake- but he had somewhat long dark hair- and he was really personable and attentive! Drinks were refilled without us asking which was great! Not my first choice to be honest -but the kids love it here and if they're happy, well life is good.  I'll continue to bring them as long as the service remains the same as I experienced tonight because well for some darned reason my boys love it here!

I find it hard to review chain restaurants as they are normally all the same. I had an issue here were my credit card was not properly returned to me after a paid my bill. The manager took zero responsibility for this. Service was barely OK. I will only return to this location if I have no other choices. I have no praise to give to this location.

109,K M.,"Hackensack, NJ",1,5,,1.0,2015-02-12,"The worst. Yelp needs to get a zero stars option. I went to the bar for happy hour specials and it took me no less that 30 minutes to flag down a server to acknowledge me. The bartender was lazy and uninterested in serving me but I gave him a pass because I wouldn't want to work on a day with so many discounted (and endless refill) items either. As the dinner went on I realized that maybe I was too nice. I never got half the apps I ordered and when I told him that he rolled his eyes and walked away. Okay...? Eventually 1 hour + later, I got sick of waiting around. I asked him for the check and he comes back about 20 minutes later. When my card is returned to me, he actually has the nerve to STAND THERE next to me, less that 1 foot away, to see how much I'm going to tip him. He did not pre-bus my table, he cleared away ZERO cups and dishes my entire time there, he did not refill a single beverage, but he decides he has the time to wait there while I write his tip... Really. Now, I'm usually 20%+ tipper even on mediocre service because I've been a server before and it SUCKS but this time I had no mercy. On the $80 check I gave him $3 because he shamelessly and offensively stood there to make sure he was going to get tipped. Didn't make small talk or even pretend like he wasn't spying over the shoulder as I signed the slip. Well jokes on you, because you just bit yourself in the a@@. He doesn't bid me farewell, just walks away. Fast forward to 3 days later.... I get my credit card statement. This server, JUSTIN, took it upon himself to change the tip I left him to $15 dollars!!!! Are you f*cking kidding me?? He committed FRAUD and STOLE from me by giving himself more money and he thought I wouldn't notice??? I had to call the store and go through like 5 managers to finally reach the GM. One manager refunded me the stolen tip and didn't offer me any other resolution. The GM was nice enough after I put him in his place and they refunded me the full meal. But I had to fight for it. What kind of place is this? They acted like ""oh well, this happens sometimes. Do you want to get that money back...?"" What a horrible way to run the business.You will never catch me at this TGIF again and I hope to GOD they fired that POS Justin.

She called again at at 5:50 letting them know we were on our way.  Once we arrived they told us it'll be a 30 minute wait my frustration is growing at this point.  So it's 7:15pm we decided to call Applebee's that was right across.  Applebee's took our reservation over the phone told it'll be 30min they did better our table was ready in 15min.  It's 7:30pm when we decided to leave Friday's and explained our frustration to management who didn't seem very apologetic.  The manager Doug is close to shouting that he can't control how long people decide to pay their checks or how long they take to eat.  I would think after such a bad experience the only words out of your mouth should be ""I'm sorry I do apologize for the long wait"" but he seemed to get mad at me for complaining, guess your not allowed to complain.  All in all I won't be coming back to this Friday's location and I urge everyone else to do the same, unless you want your Saturday night ruined.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hackensack?start=80,2.4,2.4,2.4,2.02,2.4

They have the unlimited appetizers with a limited selection. They have 2 for $16 now instead of 2 for $10 or 2 for $12. Just seems like the food up'd in price a bit but it's cool. Friday's food doesn't disappoint me at all.  So I order the three taste and share for $16; bacon mac & cheese bites, thai pork tacos, and corned beef & swiss sliders. They were all so tasty. The mac and cheese in the fried balls was filled with gooey cheese it was delicious. The thai pork taco had good taste to it but the whole taco itself was cold which was disappointing. The sliders were amazing, they are on a nice soft pretzel bun, comes with pickle, and the onions on the slider were to die for, sweet and full of flavor. They were the best out of the three. My friend got the 2 for $16 , the bbq flatbread pizza with the steak and fries. Her steak was pretty good and the fries were perfectly salty. Our drinks were super good too.

First off, it's like somebody took pancake syrup and sprayed it randomly around the bar area. There were sticky spots on the floor, on the bar and on the menus. Gross.  We ordered two endless appetizers for $10 each. Boneless Buffalo wings and meatballs. We thought the catch was going to be not being able to get prompt refills. That was a non-issue; the food came out quickly, but just barely warm. We complained about the coldness of the food after round one which was the most generously sized.

Monday night, September 11, 2017- quick dinner before heading to the Paul McCartney concert. Four people for dinner - one with special needs. Menus- some were missing pages, ketchup inside one, and we were refused outdoor seating even though the tables were set for out door seating. Drinks- server didn't know what wines and beers were on happy hour. Ordering food - we were extremely specific: one Cobb salad and two sizzling chicken and shrimp. One person was sharing their sizzling chicken and shrimp with the special needs person. We even repeated this- and she repeated it back to us. Waited a total of 25 mins for food- strange because we were one of 7 tables in the entire restaurant.  Arrival of food- you guessed it - she screwed up the order - we received two Cobb salads and no sizzling chicken and shrimps. We tried to be understanding and said that we'd eat the extra Cobb salad and just bring one chicken and shrimp sizzler. Btw- our drinks were not refilled once at this point. Ten minuets later - the manager came over and asked which salad we wanted the chicken and shrimp on!  We told the lovely manager what we ordered and what we received and that we'd just take one chicken and shrimp. She said she would rush it. After waiting sixteen minutes- we begged to get the dinner to go, and for the check. Check came- no discount, nothing on the house, and the server actually put a heart around the part where it leaves the percentages of tips to leave. Sorry- until you learn the menu, take your job seriously, write it down, and get an order remotely correct, you won't get 20% from me. (Yes, we did tip her).
