126,Clarence P.,"Accokeek, MD",0,53,,3.0,2012-07-01,Had a quick meal on the way to the airport.   Typical chain food...middle of the road.... Had better than average service. Manager walked around checking on service.  Very friendly server and staff. Service should be a 4 star...but being a chain they are required to serve food as directed by the office.  You will never get good food when directed by a corporate lawyer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=140,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.5720000000000005

Drinks are pricey and light (as to be expected) BUT the food is pretty good. Some white cheese nacho dip appetizer was surprisingly good, and my Cajian shrimp/chicken was BOMB!  He had steak and mashed potatoes with corn - the corn had a lot going on (salt and I think Parmesan cheese)- he swore it was good; I wasn't putting that experiment in my mouth knowing the privacy of my own home was a 2 hour movie away - I'm GOOD THANKS!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=100,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604
79,Jonathan G.,"Fort Belvoir, VA",25,48,282.0,4.0,2012-08-16,"It's Fridays!! They are pretty good about having the same menu and service every where you go. I ordered the Cajun chicken pasta dinner and it was very good. Their happy hour is not that great but for this area a $6 Margarita is apparently a good deal.  I defiantly recommend the Cajun pasta. The flavors are not over powering and go great with a good beer or wine, not so much with a Margarita. The dish is like a Fettuccine Alfredo meal without the heaviness. Also don't be afraid about the Cajun because its not spicy, the Cajun is just seasoning that adds the flavor. Good luck with trying to order dessert after this meal, you won't feel fat but you will feel full. As a side note don't order the Oreo Madness because it's a huge rip-off. $6 for an Oreo ice cream sandwich on a plate with a half a slice of strawberry and some chocolate and caramel sauce on the plate. Nothing special or creative.     Last, the customer service at this location is good at the bar. I have yet to eat at the regular dinning area to comment on that area. So, enjoy the bar and make sure you sign up for the club membership because it's worth it if you eat there a lot.

We come here almost every Thursday for the $3 appetizers and $3 specialty drinks. The White Queso, Green Bean Fries and BBQ chicken flatbread are always what we get! I mean, seriously, for $12 you have 4 different dishes that you can share and be completely satisfied.  We've tried a lot of the other dishes here and haven't been disappointed. Their Cajun Pasta is awesome. Would also recommend the Jack Daniel's Sampler and the Jack Daniel's Burger.  Make sure to sign up to be a Stripes member! Every dollar you spend is a point, and once you accumulate enough points you get freebies. 50 points- free appetizer or dessert, 80 points- free sandwich or burger etc. The wait hasn't ever been too bad for us, but we also show up before 6 everytime we've gone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=80,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.772,2.96

My steak came out medium well and was under seasoned. Thank goodness for the sauce! The shrimp scampi didn't excite, but with no steak on my plate the shrimp sufficed.

121,Briene B.,"Lusby, MD",3,24,21.0,1.0,2014-01-31,"HORRIBLE! No good very bad lunch!!! my friend and I decided to go here for a little catch up lunch and our experience was AWFUL!!! first, we walk in and wait 5 minutes to just be seen at the door. there was NOBODY there! when what I assume was the hostess showed, she asked our seating preference and then walks away to check availability... had she turn around she would see clearly! but ok, shift change maybe, whatever. 5 minutes later, no exaggeration, she reappears and brings us to a table in a very busy section. well, my girl friend has an infant and thought she could slide the carrier onto the seat. nope, didn't fit. and we were right on a corner so if we put the sling thing on the side of the table, we'd block the isle. I point to the empty area on the other side of our section, almost totally open area with part booth part chairs. hostess disappears for another 5 minutes. I'm not kidding!!! she comes back and says there are 2 tables, one right by the door and one on the other side of the restaurant. I opt for the one actually in a dining area and the hostess just stands there blocking the way from where we were. we stood there for a good 3 minutes before I just charged past her since she obviously wasn't going to seat us. when we sat down, we ordered our drinks and an app... I got the steak tacos and a blackberry Long Island iced tea... the tacos were served with plain white rice, not sure what their purpose was? my first bite of the taco was gristley, fatty, unchewable meat that tasted like I bit into a flower bouquet... surely that's not what I'm paying $12 for!! so I took another bite of just the meat and again, FLOWERS!! no I'm not kidding! it was so inedible. my friend got the buffalo chicken bites and a strawberry daiquiri, she was kinda shoving them around too. our drinks... omg the drinks... and I swear, I SWEAR I'm not kidding!! my LI iced tea was like shoving a straw into a bottle of vodka. my friend's daiquiri was half melted when it came to the table and just as strong! our waitress, who we almost never saw, comes by and sees I'm not eating my tacos, and asks how they are. I NEVER return ANYTHING! I asked if I could have the same as my friend. I love buffalo chicken bites, you can't go wrong! ohhhh they did... and I understand why she was just playing with hers... they were so SALTY... it was like eating a saucey, spicey cube of tofu that was breaded with rock salt. the best thing we had was our plate of fries we ordered for my friend's toddler, and the ""nachos"" we had as our app which was only a crispy tortilla smeared with refried beans and melted cheese topped with a single jalapeño chip...  my friend asked for another sprite and she never got it.... we'll NEVER go back there. bad service.

Usually we get a table but I was so hungry I didn't feel like waiting. First time sitting at the bar. For it to be a FULL bar I didn't wait long at all to be noticed. Bartender Ashley is a rock star. She was busy and still made us feel like we were the only ones there. Makes a hell of a Long Island. The other bartenders checked up on us too from time to time. BBQ wings were SO GOOD.

The hostesses were unwelcoming and organized, which should have been a clue. We waited 25+ minutes for a table although there were ample empty tables available throughout the restaurant.  Once seated it took 15+ minutes for our waitress to bring our water (two of us went to the restroom separately during this period and came back to still no water).  Oh and not to mention, our waitress had a trainee following her around that she alleged would be helping her out. Fast forward, we received our waters and other ordered  beverages however one of our orders was completely wrong. Somehow one of entrees was confused with a appetizer. When we told the fella who brought out our food that the entree was wrong, he asked us who our waiter was. Ummm, you work here and we don't. Can you please figure out the name of your colleague and figure out the mishap behind the scenes? Or did you want is to take the entree back to the cook ourselves and have it corrected? Once that issue was resolved, the strange fella brought out the corrected meal but our waitress and her trainee never rolled back around to ask if it was resolved or refill any of our drinks. We ate, paid, and rolled out. Subpar experience overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=100,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.408,2.76

Me and my twin 12 year old boys each got a soda. Spinach flatbread as appt. ( turned out it happened to be a $5 appt special ) it was just ok, bland and soggy...nothing to rave about. Honestly it isn't worth more than $5, def not $8.99 which is the regular price. One son got a MR done steak and rib with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Steak came all brown and well done chewy and tough which we sent back and after waiting for a good while, finally replace with a MR steak, but it was still a bit chewy. Steak just wasn't the best quality.  My other son got shrimp and chicken Cajun pasta. It was just okay, not well seasoned. Pretty bland.  I got French onion soup and Cobb salad with balsamic dressing on the side. The French onion soup was the worst French onion soup I have ever tasted, the soup was incredibly salty, it was so dense and thick like a can of condensed soup as is. Hard to swallow. If you are going to serve canned soup, at least add some liquid to dilute it !!! Salad was fine, can't really mess up a Cobb salad. For 3 of us it was $70. I will gladly pay more for good food.

118,Courtney K.,"Annapolis, MD",357,1748,2174.0,2.0,2015-08-26,"Bottom Line: Bar food which would be tolerable if the service wasn't dismal. I'm generally not a big fan of chain restaurants (Cheesecake Factory and a few others being exceptions) but the Arundel Mills area is peppered with chain restaurants and there was a group decision to get a bite to eat here absent much better choices.  My experience at this Friday's is certainly a reminder of why I haven't eaten at this chain in a decade.  In the spirit of fairness, let's note a few positive items about this restaurant: - Ample parking - Hip interior - Large menu with lots of bar food options - A handful of items are always on happy hour special at great prices - Friendly and professional hostess - Thrifty options for big appetites especially with promotions like endless appetizers. The food here is about what one would expect from an American chain restaurant and bar - burgers, fires, pasta, glutinous appetizers, rich desserts, etc.  When I was 20 I loved all of these dishes and could metabolize them like a champ.  But fast forward many years, and I'm now seeking more unique dishes in less corny atmospheres. The biggest struggle at this Friday's was the service.  It was unanimous at my table of six that service was lacking. Specific issues with the service included the following: - Server's underwear hanging out of the waist of his pants.  Unsightly. - Wrong drinks delivered on two occasions for which we were fully charged. - Only five menus were provided for six people, a sixth menu was never brought out despite asking. - I ordered an appetizer for my entree and was told it would come out first since it was technically an appetizer which I thought was lame but I didn't protest.  In the end, my appetizer was delivered after all of the main courses. I think appetizers should be delivered before main courses unless otherwise requested by the diner.   - Getting condiments was tough.  In some cases they'd been requested when placing orders and we still couldn't get them without asking multiple times.  - Our waiter didn't write anything down which would have been fine if he could remember what we ordered without coming back to check the details.  Additionally, our check was wrong so we ended up writing what we had ordered down for him. Another area of concern is that there was a lot of water being tracked from behind the bar to the restaurant floor.  This made for a treacherous trip to some tables and the bathrooms.  When a restaurant is this messy (and dangerous) in plain sight it really makes me question how it's managed in general.  Diner be aware.  Two stars is probably a bit generous for this restaurant but I always like to give businesses the benefit of the doubt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=40,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.12,2.84

No excuses, just great service. He was extremely personable and made sure that we were all having a great time.  The cousin had brought in some cupcakes he ordered from a bakery, which they stored in the back for us to help make room at our table. He made sure that they brought out app plates and napkins, and evem wrote ""Don't Touch"" on the box so that other servers in the back wouldn't accidentally help themselves to them (good lookin out!). When we were done, he took the liberty of splitting our checks to avoid that post-dinner deficiency of basic math skills that people seem to experience every time they go to a group dinner and it is time to pay their portion of the bill. Everyone was able to settle up quickly and easily, and no one was forced to overpay to help cover the cost of something they did not order. That, in and of itself, was enough to make it a 5-star visit. The servers at this Friday's location all have these ipad-like devices where they can insert orders right at the table, as well as swipe a patron's credit card in front of them at the table (instead of disappearing with it and doing God-knows what with it). As a person that has had her identity stolen several times, that makes me very happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=20,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.484,2.72

This is where a slight disappointment came in. The steak was VERY bland (Perhaps it was because of no sauce?). Good thing the sides were good (Mash potators& Steamed broccoli). The burger was also disappointing because it was so small. I feel like we could have gotten better portion sizes at a fast food place.

We orderd the Bacon Jalapeños  which was stuffed with pulled  beef and cheese and Bacon with this sauce that made you want to shout out yesssss. It was   not to spicy but just right.  The next appetizer was the fried Green beans.  Omg wowee l fell in love instantly.   My overall experience was great and will definitely be returning.  Preferably on a weekday or early Saturday or Sunday  when it's less of a crowd.  I will definitely be ordering the fried Green Beans since they were very fresh and went very well with the sauce that was included.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=20,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.32,2.64

Our waitress was extremely nice; but after a long wait and realizing everyone around us had received their food; even those that came in after us, we were informed that our ribs had been burnt! The waitress informed us she requested they remake them rather than bring them out to us; which we greatly appreciated.  Well.....after another long wait the ribs finally arrived. But much to our dismay....they too were burnt! Luckily we, the waitress, and the manager had a sense of humor and were able to laugh at the burnt bone fiasco.

When we got there we decided to sit at the booths near the bar. Our waitress seemed to be pleasant and we ordered drinks and food. My beer came in a short period of time and was cold so I was happy about that! I ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp, my mom ordered an ahi tuna wrap but asked for it without kale and onions and my niece ordered Mac and cheese. We also ordered chicken potstickers as an appetizer and it came pretty quick. When the food arrived my moms wrap had the kale and onions she asked be removed being the kind person she is she just removed the onions and dealt with the kale. My food arrived and was absolutely horrible! The chicken was rubbery and had no flavor, and the shrimp looked like someone dumped salsa all over it not to mention it was chewy! The waitress wasn't mean but she wasn't very attentive. She walked over and asked how things were and kept walking past us as my mom was trying to respond. After that she was not seen again from till the check arrived! She did however stop to talk to a table of a group of guys for quite awhile. All in all my nieces Mac and cheese was the best item of food and for a check total of $50 this was not even remotely worth it! Given that there weren't many people there I would expect more attentive service! Not going back again! Which is sad because I've had so much better service before the remodel. *UPDATE* So against my better judgement I went again for a happy hour with some coworkers and not only was the tostado nachos horrible and disgusting after two bites but my friend had a fly in his amaretto sour....

I chose the chicken and shrimp cheese skillet with mashed potatoes and it was tiny, not deveined shrimp and two small pieces of bland grilled chicken on top of similarly bland cheese. The only good thing about it was the caramelized cheese on the skillet. The mashed potatoes, if you can call them that, were obviously instant potatoes. My husband had chicken pasta with the same small pieces of chicken and the pasta sauce tasted worse than Ragu from the store.

Fridays is located in Washington, D.C. If you go to Fridays you should get strawberry soda with chicken strips. You could also get a slushie with two hamburgers. In my opinion, Fridays is the best place to eat. First, they give you endless appetizers. Second, some of the meals are free because there isn't that much food on your plate. Lastly, if you want to invite your friends and family to a restaurant Fridays is the best place. I suggest you go to Fridays. Some may argue that DCity Smokehouse is better than Fridays but I disagree. Fridays is off the hook! If you want to get steak and ribs go to Fridays. Second if you want to get slushies go to Fridays.

Also, the first time I've ever been kicked out of a bar BEFORE closing! I attended a work happy hour with my boyfriend's co-workers (who were trying to spend a lot of money) on Monday night and the employees not only didn't seem to care, but made us feel like an inconvenience. We waited 20 minutes for our first round of beers and didn't see the server again for 30 minutes but when we did see her she would sit down while taking our order. She also never cleared plates from our table; we had ordered about 20 appetizers. Meanwhile, the bartender was screaming at and egging on drunk patrons at the bar. After an hour and a half my boyfriend and I got to order our second round which was Yuengling, and when we tried it it tasted like an orange Christmas tree. We couldnt figure out what it was, but it most definitely was NOT  what we ordered. Instead of trying to remedy the situation the server fought with us about it. Then at 1:45 the barender and server started to kick us out of the bar! We all had full beers and their hours say they were open til 2am. They got security involved and ran us out. We didn't even finish what we paid for. All in all I was a very unhappy customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=40,2.12,2.58,2.58,1.924,2.396

Despite 3 people being at the hostess stand. The hostess, a server and the manager. The manager must have been giving instructions or something but you have to lead by example. If you, as a manager, show no interest in the clients then how can your staff?  so I had a 35 minute wait at 11pm on a Friday. No biggie. I come in to get the table after time is up  and the hostess offers the seat yourself option to a group of ladies before us. Ok. Again, no big deal because I'm about to be seated anyway. Wrong. She leads us to a narrow dining area kind of away from everyone else. Dirty floor. Water on the chair. Gross. I told her there's water on the chair. She just looked at me. Ok so this is going nowhere. I asked her if the bar is self seating and yes at the bar itself and the hightops. Would have been nice to be offered that when you said there was a 35 minute wait. Our server, I forget his name, was great! The food situation though...we did the endless apps. There were only 2 of us. The first round took about 30 minutes to come out. I was annoyed but patient. When it did come, it looked like it had been sitting under a lamp for ages. Second round took 22 minutes. I timed it. One of the apps came out wrong. Not wrong because we customized it-we ordered the item as is....and they sent it out with ingredients missing. That's what did it for me.

Lol Walked in was really busy for a Sat nite wasn't to much past 10pm. There where alotta families and teenagers hanging out. Which is prob norm since it is right across street from Arundel Mills mall. Told greeter a table for two and they sat my fiance and I down at a Boothe.  This is where the three stars come in. Waitress comes gives us menus we already know were here for mainly desert. But still wanted time to choose and it's not like there desert options are that many four to be exact.  I go to the restroom and it's right by the kitchen entry/exit area and it's jus really slippery around that area. How nobody falls is beyond me. I had to skid my heels jus to get the slickness off. Waitress asks if we wanted to start out with drinks I tell her for now I would like a glass of water. She says some kinda smart remark like ""We waited around for that"". My finance looks at her and waitress did one of those I think I'm funny laugh to a oh it wasn't funny serious face. (Fiance told me she wanted her order while I was gone but she wanted wait for me hence the lame smart ass remark.) She says ok and verbally tells us about the happy hour which I had no intentions of getting since I been drinking all day and wanted slow down for an event the next day.  She comes back with my water and asks are we ready to order. I tell her I want the Vanilla bean cheese cake and my fiance asks for the brownie. I then ask about the iced tea drinks before she leaves and if it's sweetened. She just simply says no. There wasn't any recos of similar drinks if any just a plain flat no.  I'm thinking ok as she wasn't really interested in meeting my needs. The cheese cake arrived which was the best part of being there. It tasted just like vanilla bean with a hint of cheesecake. Very flavorful. It was plated nicely. My fiance didn't care for her brownie her exact words were ""Extra fudgy and way to rich"" which promted her to order a glass of water.  We waited a good 10 - 15 mins as our waitress walked past us and went to her other tables as she can see we were done and looking up actually at her to see when she would stop and service us again.
