53,Susan S.,"Hummelstown, PA",0,7,,1.0,2012-05-15,"Had a horrible TGIF experience last week. I normally love this chain for consistent food but will not go back to this one. We waited 15 minutes in an empty restaurant for a table, 15 more to give a drink order, 10 more to get the drink and on and on....l overall a two HOUR casual dinner! Each step was painful. At the end, they forgot to give me back my stripes card so I had to retun, just one final nail in the decision to not go back .

My husband actually used to work at a Friday's, so we love to eat at one from time to time. We ate at this particular Friday's on a Sunday evening. I would say the restaurant was moderately busy. We sat at the bar. The bartender was great. I haven't had a bartender with that great of a ""bartender"" attitude in awhile. Funny, social, sarcastic, playful with the customers, put what we wanted to watch on the tv, offered suggestions from the menu and pointed out the 2 for $16 deal that my husband ended up getting. Our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time. The spinach artichoke dip was even better than we remembered. For entrees, I had a 6 oz sirloin medium rare with mashed potatoes and broccoli. My husband had the shrimp & chicken Cajun pasta. My steak was more on the medium side but it had a good flavor so I didn't send it back. The mashed potatoes were amazing. The broccoli came in a big chunk and still had the hard stem attached, but was good. My husband really liked his pasta but it came swimming in oil which was unpleasant to look at. It totally made you think of how many calories you were consuming lol. I had a few of his shrimp and they were super yummy. The beer was super cold, just like I like it. I could see a place like this getting slammed with customers on most days since it's located right off a busy highway, but I definitely will come back again.

These other items include a couple types of bacon, onions, mushrooms etc..  I went with bacon and onion straws.

I usually come to Fridays for happy hour / dinner, and I'll continue to come in the evening. I would consider doing lunch on weekend, but  I don't think we'd come back for lunch during the week because the wait to table time was entirely too long.  We were seated around 12:15. It took some time for us to decide what we wanted.  We placed our orders around 12:25.  Our food came out at 12:55.  A half an hour is entirely too long of a wait for food when you only have an hour lunch.  I'd be more understanding if the restaurant were packed with people. Maybe a longer wait if we had a large group, It might take some time for them to get the meals together. There were only three of us, and they didn't appear to be super busy.

We both got overly charbroiled burgers that were way passed well done, and my was even burnt. The fries were cold. The burgers were barely luke warm. We had ordered a side of ranch for the fries, which we did not get.  I wanted mushrooms as an add on to my burger, and i received about 7 small pieces. Along with two of the smallest pickle slices I have ever seen, and about a 3 inch piece of onion. You are absolutely ridiculous with your topping portions, especially for what you charge.  We also ordered dessert, Oreo Madness, which was described on the menu as 'COOKIES AND CREAM ICE CREAM SANDWICHED BETWEEN LAYERS OF HAND-CRUMBLED OREO™ COOKIE CRUST, DRIZZLED WITH PREMIUM GHIRARDELLI® CHOCOLATE SAUCE.' What we got, was a layer of crumbled oreo cookies with cookies and cream ice cream on top, in a wax paper cup. All that was missing was the wooden 'spoon' you got when you were 8 years old.

The longer we thought about it, the more we realized that the lukewarm dishes were also a safety concern.  Went on line at Trip Advisor and Yelp to see too many one and two star reviews.  So this is not a one time issue, but a repetitive issue :(  So despite contacting corporate TGIF Friday's no positive solution or response.  Letting food cool can be a serious health issue, but apparently it is not one that corporate considers important enough to address.  There are way too many good options folks to put up with TGIF especially if main office knows and no positive change has taken place.  If you are in Harrisburg PA near Union Deposit, there are dozens of choices nearby.  Texas Roadhouse, Outback Steak House are right across the street!  and O'Reilly's Tap Room & Kitchen around the corner are much better options! So ditch TGIF Friday and go elsewhere!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-harrisburg-2?start=20,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
13,Tony C.,"Tavernier, FL",47,28,14.0,1.0,2017-07-26,"I wish I could give this place zero stars. The waitstaff made us wait about five minutes to get seated. Once we got seated, we waited 15 minutes for the waiter to tell us there was a wait because they're so short staffed. What a great waste of half an hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-harrisburg-2,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
14,Nicole M.,"New Cumberland, PA",19,3,,2.0,2017-08-06,When we arrived and were seated no one came up to greet us or take our drink order. I went back to the front to ask about this and no one was up front either! What looked like a kitchen staff walked by and asked if I needed to be seated. I told him that we didn't have a waiter and went to sit back down. Our waiter then came over and explained he had seen us sitting there but didn't know we were his table! We then ordered. Food took extremely long to come out. The food was ok but service continued to be very poor throughout our visit!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-harrisburg-2,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
17,Christian D.,"Staunton, VA",0,1,,1.0,2017-08-12,"Okay. First of all, we went around 10. When we pulled up, we thought it was closed down because it had NO lights. It is completely dark in the parking lot and surrounding area. Strike one. We go inside and waited to be sat a few minutes which wasn't that big of a deal, but they weren't busy. So we get greeted by a REALLY friendly host and we're like, ""oh okay, this isn't so bad at all."" Well then we get seated in our seats where the table was still wet with rings from the previous table, a salt shaker that's completely empty, and not enough silverware. Then the fun stuff happens. Our server: Amanda, Cynthia, Rachel, Sarah, Rebecca, or whatever her name is comes over to get our drink order. From the beginning she puts out a fake smile and an attitude that screams ""I don't want to be here."" Strike two. She tries to hurry our order but we aren't ready, so she becomes annoyed with us. When we do order, the food takes about 30 minutes and comes to us in stages. The kids meal comes first with a sad excuse for a portion of old fries. Then my steak (medium well) comes and I was asked to cut into it. I cut and blood comes out, so I ask to have it cooked more. Well I ate all of my broccoli and mashed potatoes while it was supposed to be cooking from medium to medium well. Why that took 15 minutes, I'm not sure. So Becky brings back my steak which is now dry and looks well done. So I cut again and I don't think it was even cooked, probably put in the microwave to try and quick cook it. Strike three. I'm done. She brings the check, puts it down, doesn't ask if it needs to be split. Doesn't ask me why I'm clearly not eating my steak. Doesn't send a manager to follow up. Doesn't even ask how it tasted considering it was messed up the first time. She literally does not care and clearly does not enjoy her job. I'm appalled. Catherine was the worst server we have ever had and it wasn't even worth complaining because we will NEVER be back. I didn't even want to tip her it was so bad, and I have a guilty conscience. That's SAD! I see why this location has two and a half stars. We did take the steak home because my boyfriend will eat it, but they need to get it together.  Also, we checked the name on the receipts of which we paid for the meals we shouldn't have and our servers name was Samantha. She was terrible. 2/10, do not recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-harrisburg-2,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

The cleanliness of the establishment was absolutely disgusting. (See photo).   The dirty dining area is the reason I'll never eat here again. Well, that and the thought of, if the dining area looks like this, I'm sure the kitchen looks ten times worse!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-harrisburg-2,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

1,Mandi H.,"Harrisburg, PA",3,5,8.0,1.0,2017-09-09,"TL;DR incredibly slow, food allergies not respected. We arrived at 9:45pm, with a party of 16. First, they didn't give us enough chairs. Half hour later, they move us to an area with elbow room. It takes 20 minutes for the waiter to take drink orders, and by that time we gave him food orders too. Took another half hour for drinks to start coming out, 3 at a time. Then food starts coming out, and there are people still without drinks!  One of our party is allergic to peppers. She tells the waiter this. Her nachos come out WITH PEPPERS MIXED IN. She almost eats one!!! A manager is called. So sorry, we'll make them again. The nachos come out again, and there are STILL PEPPERS IN THEM. Manager says, oh sorry, the pablano has peppers in it. We can't make this without them. Finally, people are ready to get their checks. The checks are all wrong, nothing is on the correct check. Drinks mixed up, food mixed up, a huge mess. The last two couples didn't pay and leave until 12:30. Will NEVER be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-harrisburg-2,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36

5,Nicholas E.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",0,19,18.0,1.0,2017-10-09,"Had lunch here which was not a good experience. The restaurant was about 80 percent empty during lunch time. We were led to a table that had a large puddle of water next to it (and I do mean a large puddle - like three feet across). We asked to be seated in another area. No worries up until this point.  After being seated we ordered our food. One hour later the food had still not arrived. The place was still almost empty and our server was nowhere to be found. Other staff were standing around texting. I interrupted the bartender and asked him if our server still worked there. The manager came over and explained that the computer system was down. The server, therefore, did not know our order was ready. He apologized.  Seriously? The place was empty and she couldn't figure out after an hour that our food was ready?  Anyway, about fifteen minutes later our food came. I wasn't sure if I had ordered sliders or two small bricks. It tasted about the same. To the manager's credit he didn't charge me for the meal but we paid for everything else. We tipped the server 15 percent, which considering the service was a gift. Not going back here and judging by the reviews neither should you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-harrisburg-2,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
8,Krista G.,"Harrisburg, PA",27,7,,1.0,2017-10-25,"I was coming here frequently, with my boyfriend, to get their endless apps. Twice now, we've had sticky stuff all over the table and have had to ask for them to be cleaned again. They often get backed up, between apps, causing you to wait 10-15 mins with no food. I've had apps brought out ice cold, after waiting this long. Now, they've raised their price to $15 a person and lowered the options available to just 4 but have kept the small portions the same. If it weren't for the happy hour (which a bit more than other establishments) and my boyfriend wanting garlic parm wings, I wouldn't even be here. I won't come again as I'm highly, highly dissatisfied.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-harrisburg-2,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
6,Kiani J.,"Philadelphia, PA",59,16,24.0,1.0,2017-11-06,Worst Friday's I've ever been to!!!! I was staying at the hotel right around the corner and decided to go grab a quick bite and drink. The entire staff seemed a little off (mentally challenged/drug usage). We were sat and nobody came over to us for about 5 minutes so we went and sat in a different section. That waitress who I'm 95% does drugs (I've worked in diners I know the signs) took about 10 minutes to bring us water. I also ordered a drink and it came out in the middle of my meal and was wrong. I sent it back and never got the new drink made... Overall it sucked and the food was lacking. Never again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-harrisburg-2,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002

We had to scream for our server to even come by and bring us another water because we were all out. Never actually offered a refill , and would look straight in your eye and walked the other way .
