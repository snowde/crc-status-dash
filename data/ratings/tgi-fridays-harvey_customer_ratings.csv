We shared the pretzel and beer cheese dip, it's a must have from now on it was so good. I had the Tennessee pulled pork sandwich and sweet potato fries, it was very good and I think the sauce has pineapples in it, very delicious.  My husband had the sizzling chicken and shrimp, it was VERY HOT, not a bad thing! Better than having a cold dish. We were both happy with our dishes. For dessert we had the whiskey cake, AMAZING!! It was a great dish and no whiskey flavor at all! I will be getting that one again.  Our service was surprisingly great, which is something we've not come to expect there as we eat here often.  I tried the pink punk Cosmo! It's very different and delicious! It's served in a martini class with cotton candy in it and the server pours the Cosmo from the shaker into the glass at the table! It was sweet but very good!  Our drinks were never even close to empty, our food was perfectly timed and our server kept our table clear of dirty dishes.  For an appetizer, two entrees, dessert, and a drink our bill +25% tip was under $50! More trips like this and I will be returning even more often. I wish I had caught the servers name so I could give her credit on here but I was a little preoccupied by the fact that I was enjoying a child-free lunch!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-harvey?start=20,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544

We ordered from that awesome menu where you order an appetizer (delicious queso) and we split an entree (burger) for like some ridiculously low price.  I can't find the price but it was so cheap it was kind of scandelous! hehe... Well, we parked ourselves there for like 3 hours so that we were still there for Happy Hour when certain appetizers are half off and the drinks are on special!  hehe... What I really enjoyed was that our waitress was very attentive.  We sat by the bar because there was a wait for a table for two and we were starving.  Our food came out quickly and we just enjoyed the ambience.  I heard one table of four tell our waitress that they really appreciated her service too because usually they have terrible service at TGIF.

Last time I had the ""3 appetizers for $12"" deal, and I had spinach and artichoke dip, pot stickers,and buffalo nuggets. Average bar food but nothing was nasty. On my most recent visit, I found something really good! They have a ""2 for $10"" deal where you get an appetizer and an entree for $10. I got a wedge salad with blue cheese and bacon as my appetizer. The lettuce wedge was fresh and crunchy, and they did not skimp on the blue cheese or bacon. Very good! My entree was the 8 oz petite sirloin, which was a pretty good piece of meat considering it was on the ""2 for $10"" menu. The mashed potatoes had flavor and the tomato and mozzarella salad was adequate. Nothing to complain about with this meal.

Nobody in the restaurant ever asked us our age, we hadn't tried to sit at the bar and order drinks. The waitress asked to see our ID's because apparently the restaurant has had problems with teenagers in the past. That's all fine and dandy, however instead of causing a huge scene and making the guests at your restaurant wonder why they were being treated as if they didn't belong they should make their bootleg policies known at the door.

Pan Seared Pot Stickers: tastes like pork, don't quote me on that. surprisingly good , came with a sweet soy sauce.

We ordered the appetiZer special where you can get three different appetizers (the choices were limited).   Garlic Parmesan wings were really good and flavorful. I really liked how they had shredded parm on top of the wings. Moz sticks were average but satisfied my craving. It became a little too cheesy after. Pot stickers weren't that great. Don't get them. Of course you don't wanna go to tgif for something like pot stickers . . .  We also ordered and shared the sizzling chicken and shrimp, which was not too bad. Chicken was a little bland, the shrimp had a tomato-ish seasoning, and the sauce/cheese on the sizzling plate complimented the mash potatoes very well. Pretty good for a simple dish. It satisfied our hunger. For two, the amount of food was enough.

It's gross. We were greeted and since there  weren't many people in the restaurant and we were seated right away. Our server came over after a few minutes to take our drink order. I can't remember his name (Angel maybe) but he wasn't stellar. He talked so quietly I could barely hear him over the music playing. And he wasn't personable at all. He looked like he didn't even want to be there.  After a few minutes he brought our drinks and said he'd be right back for our order. He was back within 5 minutes and took our order. (And that was he last we saw of him until it was time to bring the check). We ordered appetizers and our meals at the same time. The appetizers came out very quickly (with a different server) and were quite delicious. We had the pot stickers and the mozzarella sticks.  A few minutes later the hostess brought our meals over. I had the California chicken club which wasn't bad. The menu said it was on a toasted baguette and it wasn't. And it just lacked some salt and flavor in general. By this time my water was empty and our server never came around to refill it.  Once we were done eating, it was a good 10 minutes before our server came back over. I asked for boxes for our food and he promptly brought back 1 box. We clearly had 2 plates of food to box up and he brought just one box. He left and brought back 2 small boxes and our bill. And then he was speedy!  He was quick to pick up my bill and bring it back for me to sign.  I give this place 2 stars because the food wasn't terrible.

Every Wednesday my girl Trish (aka ""TrishFish"" lol inside joke) at the hostess stand knows exactly how I like to always set the mood with a hot plate of steaming jala-poppos and an ice cold Cocoa-Ruski (White Russian With Chocolate Milk: A Siggy Cocktail That'll Knock Your Wools Off) AND THATS JUST MY APP GAME!  Where else can you find authentic Mexican jalapeño poppers in Metairie? Or in NORTH AMERICA ALL TOGETHER! I swear the cream cheese filling is so fresh and so dank that you'll think they just put jalloed out jallas up to the cows teet right out back and filled'er up.  As soon as Trish notices that I'm nearing the end of a delectable dozen jalla poppos, she hits me with an ice cold mich light and a shot of bacardi blueberry to put my sweats at bay. She's the best, ask for her and tip BIG (I always leave her my extra change, she deserves it!!).  Ambiance: It's like the DJ is spinning the hottest in alt rock and classic rock just to get my attention because, I'm not lying, EVERY SONG IS THE BEST. Wanna hear good vocals/Lyrics? BOOM: father of mine by everclear. Wanna hear an awesome guitar solo? SHRED: no rain by blind melon. How bout something for the ladies? MEOW: Evanescence singing bring me to life.  Price: it's cheap as hell but don't bring a date cos there are TONS of single chicks (usually) drinking LITs and they LOVE when u share your apps and buy them burgers. I've eaten all over the world and this TGI Fridays is the best. Look for me, I sit by the kitchen so I can hear the symphony of sizzlers as they exit the stainless steel gates to heaven where the chefs are.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-harvey,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
53,Dorothy H.,"New Orleans, LA",99,6,,2.0,2017-04-13,Two of my friends and I came in for dinner tonight and we are all servers mind you. But we are also young and black. Our waitress was hella rude . We kno all about stereotypes . But that's not us. We were not difficult at all. We were very polite n still tipped her 15% although she didn't deserve it. She could have gotten the full 20% . She didn't bus our table at all when we were done we had 8 plates and 5 cups everything from our entire meal. She gotta do better . Probably won't be returning,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-harvey,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

42,Anthoneshia D.,"Marrero, LA",38,154,79.0,2.0,2017-06-08,"Prior to them changing the menu, I would have given them 5 stars but being that the menu is changed I have to give them two stars.   I would literally eat there every Friday hence the name  or every other Friday. I am willing to change my review if they bring back my favorite dish. Jack Daniel's Chicken and Ribs combo.  The service here is great from the bus boys to the hostess, everyone is so friendly. They all ask about your meal and experience at the time. I've never had to return any food back to the kitchen, the food is always hot, and you will always leave with a smile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-harvey,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
52,Edwin P.,"Springfield, VA",33,20,26.0,5.0,2017-06-17,"Great time with family! We had to wait a little bit before we could sit down, but the experience was nice! Our waitress, Tina, was phenomenal! Simply amazing!! Great attitude and really went out of her way to provide outstanding service! I can't say enough great things about Tina. We had 10 people at our table and we never had to wait for our appetizers, drinks, refills or actual entrees. Tina was all over everything and made sure we were taken care of from the time we sat down until we left. Tina made our experience memorable and we will definitely come back just because of her. When you come to this TGIF, you have to ask to sit in the area that Tina is working. You will not be disappointed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-harvey,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

The dish I had was Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta, love love.... I had the strawberry lemonade to drink, and it was tasty..

48,Timothy N.,"Winter Park, FL",0,1,,1.0,2017-08-01,"This is my first review ever, ever. That's just to let you all know that my experience here has devoted me to write this. I come in after working day (literally) with my brother and sister just to have a few drinks to cool off and have some fun. We come in, took 4 mins for a host to greet us, another 3 mins for us to get seated. When we get seated, we patiently waited and I kid you not 10 mins for someone to come and take care of us. No one did. There was another server around and he looked at us several times and wouldn't even acknowledged us. Being in the service business myself, I was extremely pissed off. We can in, wasted 20 mins of our time when we could of been somewhere else with better service. Save yourself the trouble and don't come here. McDonald's next door has better service than this crap establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-harvey,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
50,Regina L.,"Gretna, LA",0,6,,2.0,2017-09-02,"Possibly the worst hamburger I've ever had. I ordered a medium Jack Daniels burger. It was cooked well-done and was dry and basically flavorless. The fries were warm, but not fresh out of the fryer hot. Two stars because the toppings on the burger were nice and very fresh and the server was adequate. I'd give that hamburger negative stars if I could.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-harvey,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
45,Li M.,"Gretna, LA",0,16,24.0,1.0,2017-10-06,"The off-duty waitress seated us and took our order. She made sure our drinks were delivered and even checked on us before she left. The waitress that came on duty did not introduce herself not did she check on us. I got up to get my own drink from the bar. I asked for the manager and he did not come until I called in the phone from the table. When he came, he listened to my concerns, said he was going to get another waiter, and walked to a table to yell another waiter to take. Are of us. The manager NEVER returned to the table until we got the check. He asked if it got better- No.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-harvey,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
44,Shaquina W.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,9,8.0,1.0,2017-11-13,"Let me start of by saying this is by far the worst restaurant experience I have ever had! The waiter was horrible, were already in such a loud environment I had to put my ear to his mouth and repeat, ""what?"" a numerous amount of time and you can only imagine how many times considering I only ordered an appetizer and left. I also had a bug fall from the ceiling dead smack into the plate, I guess there is a first time for everything. I was on a family vacation and I feel bad for the citizens of that city to have to put up with the short end of the stick. If you knew better you would do better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-harvey,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
49,D R.,"Metairie, LA",0,11,,4.0,2017-11-18,The service was wonderful. Our waiter Tj was very sweet and made sure that we did not need for anything. This Fridays is 100% better than the Fridays in Metairie. I will most definitely be coming back to this one again. The only reason i gave it 4/5 stars was because of the temperature of my kids pasta. It was more on the cooler side but not too bad. PS. The brownie à la mode is delicious!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-harvey,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
