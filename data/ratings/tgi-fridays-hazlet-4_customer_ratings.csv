25,Hely M.,"Matawan, NJ",5,85,37.0,2.0,2012-08-24,"What's up with a hand full of menu's?  Waitress was prompt and attentive.  I wasn't  very hungry and ordered a 2 for $10 special.  I ordered New England Clam   Chowder, an Angus cheese burger and a non sweetened Iced tea..   They delivered salsa and chips to the table.  It wasn't ordered and it was free.  I think it was free because the salsa had no taste, nor did the chips.  The New England Clam Chowder was watery and lacked flavor. Needed the single pack of crackers and the salt and pepper, The Angus Cheeseburger was just okay, bacon on it gave it some flavor. The fries were nothing special.  The unsweetened iced tea was very good.   To sum it up, I am in no hurry to go back. With all the talk about nutrition and limiting the size of drinks I was a little curious about the calories I ate on the so-so dinner i ate.  If Fridays website is correct, it looks like i ate about 1980 calories for the one meal.  That meal was just about the 2000 calorie a day diet most nutrition labels are based on.  I think that if I ate here often, I would be real fat if I had any other meals that day.  I will have to remember that the next time I think about eating in a Fridays.  Maybe I should have just had a couple drinks and went home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hazlet-4,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152

Lemme tell ya, the appetizers aren't half-bad.  The pot stickers and cheesy bread are kinda yummy in that I-know-my-food-is-processed-the-goverment-is-killing-me-with-GMO's kinda way.

1,Morton F.,"New Castle, DE",83,922,3709.0,1.0,2012-10-11,"This TGI Friday's is at a typical Jersey strip mall, although it is a standalone building in the lot. Parking was adequate even though the restaurant was full at my time of arrival. The food at this TGI Friday's is okay and fairly standard for this chain. However, I didn't like the service. My server had a halfway-surly attitude that I do not like to see when I'm at a sit-down restaurant. Service was slow. Then he screwed up the check and that wasted more time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hazlet-4?start=20,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.0840000000000005
3,Kayci O.,"West Hollywood, CA",0,14,3.0,1.0,2012-12-30,"Wishing I could give less than one star.  My family and I had lunch here today and were incredibly dissatisfied with every aspect of our dining experience.  I will list the positives first, as there are so few. The sweet potato fries were very well seasoned and my husband thoroughly enjoyed his pulled pork sandwich. Okay, that's it.  Now for the bad, the worse and the ugly.  The hostesses were incredibly rude and dismissive. Our waitress, ******** (my father won't let me put her name), bless her heart, left us waiting for twenty minutes before taking our drink orders, repeatedly got our order wrong and did not once ask how our meal was. The cheeseburgers were cold, the sodas were flat, the fries were soggy and the Spinach dip was the worst I have ever had.  For some reason, after our horrible meal, we decided to give dessert a try...a decision we came to regret immediately. WARNING: NEVER EVER ORDER RED VELVET CAKE FROM FRIDAY'S. It was stale, flavorless, purple and nasty.  We will never return. Learn from our mistake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hazlet-4?start=20,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.0840000000000005

24,Food G.,"Morganville, NJ",0,18,22.0,5.0,2014-07-02,I'm only writing a review for here because I think in no way does it deserve such a poor review. Me and my boyfriend come here every Sunday for half apps. We get 5 full portion apps for 20$. As well as sliders or a basket of fries for $1.50. Aside from the good price. It's delicious. The service here is great. Everyone's friendly and very rarely are we stuck with a waiter who dosent frequently return to check in. The resturant is as clean as any family resturant. The bathrooms however are always gross and smelly. I would recommend going before you come here.  HOWEVER. At dinner time (5-7) the place is always crowded. Food lacks a little. As does service. But that's expected at any busy resturant. They seat you quickly but the wait for the food is about 45 minutes.  I've never gotten sick from the food and I eat here atleast once a week. There are some dishes that aren't as good but that's any resturant. I wouldn't recommend the shrimp dishes. Although I wouldn't recommend shrimp any place that dosent frequently serve seafood.  TIPS: you can never go wrong with any of there jack Daniels options. Especially the jack chicken strips. (Appetizer),https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hazlet-4,,,,,
27,Whitney L.,"Hazlet, NJ",2,26,,1.0,2015-04-28,"I just have to say it. This place is horrible. I used to come here all the time for the convenience and now I would just rather drive an extra 5 minutes to go to Holmdel and eat around there. The bartenders are extremely rude. They look at you like you're wasting their time if you ask what some good drinks are. Food is okay. Waiting service is okay. And the last time I went there, the bartender who ended up also being our waiter... Made an unnecessary comment about my choice of food. Oh. And not to mention, gave me stale beer which when I checked the date.. It was way past expired. Haven't gone back since then!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hazlet-4,,,,,

0,Vic O.,"Matawan, NJ",0,25,,3.0,2016-02-03,"The food here is good. The service was fine and the wait time is not too bad. I am a vegetarian who is also a bit of a calorie counting healthy nut, so there are not too many options for me. I do end up splitting appetizers and entrees because of this. Overall, it is fine. I just wish that there were more options and that the Friday's chain changed there menu options more often to accommodate vegetarians.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hazlet-4?start=20,,,,,
20,Peepaw H.,"Hazlet, NJ",4,162,,3.0,2016-05-12,"I'll start this out by saying, I'm not a fan of TGI Fridays, but for convenience we went there for drinks and wings prior to seeing Captain America. Nick was the bartender, and he is a darn good bartender with a great sense of humor. They get 3 stars, because we ordered the wings hot, but they came out un-coated, but Nick was quick to get sauce to remedy the situation. Beers were flowing with little or no wait, they added more TV's to the bar and Nick lost 84 pounds because he was working out hard behind the bar (inside joke). Thanks for the good service, please get the kitchen cracking....I'll go back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hazlet-4,,,,,

26,larry c.,"PRINCE, NY",3,9,,1.0,2016-06-27,"Went to Fridays yesterday afternoon. The food wasn't up to normal. We ordered the nachos Grande , the cheese sauce was this white stuff. Not like it used to be with the regular cheese. We had sangria and mango margarita and it tasted very watered down. The waiter was unkempt. He was wearing a black half shirt and his black jeans were ragged. He spilled our drinks all over the tray as he was bringing over to our table. We were going to contact the manager wasn't friendly and seemed disinterested. The most upsetting part was two members of our party are handicapped. When we went their previously, the manager put us in a table that could fit her scooter. This time, the manager sounded put off. She said where can we put HER. This is the second time that a handicapped person in my party was disrespected. I'm not sure if this is an abnormality or if this is the new norm at your establishments",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hazlet-4,,,,,

17,Stephanie B.,"South Amboy, NJ",9,23,1.0,4.0,2016-11-19,"I usually love fridays but the last time we went, service was mad slow. The poor girl waiting on us was in charge of the bar and the tables in the bar area, so I can't knock the situation too hard but the thing is, there were workers just standing around with nothing to do while this poor girl was going back and forth. I get zoning and all like everyone has a section, but help each other out if your coworker is stacked yknow! My mom ordered an iced tea and it tasted funky so they switched it out but it still tasted funky to her. Like very earthy, might want to check that out. Usually the food is good, I haven't had a dish that I absolutely hated. Sometimes the chicken is overdone and a bit tough, but not horrible. I just wish service was a little bit faster!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hazlet-4,,,,,

16,Syra E.,"Parlin, Parlin, NJ",0,7,2.0,1.0,2017-03-01,"WARNING: TERRIBLE SERVICE, RUDE WAITRESS, UNPROFESSIONAL PLACE Came here because my brother wanted their endless apps for his birthday. The one closer to me in old bridge sucked. This location is just as bad. First off coming in, it didn't seem full or busy. The hostess asked for how many, my mother said 4 and her partner began looking for a table and the hostess told us to follow her, so we did. She went to the waitresses and I guess asked where to sit us and she pointed to a booth. I'm sorry but I'm pretty sure in the every restaurant I go this is how it goes: the hostess looks at what tables are available, gives us a menu and brings us to our seats. But NOPE that's not what happened. The waitress never greeted us but the manager telling is that she will be with us. Mind you the place was not even packed, maybe almost half was full. The waitress, Cassie, didn't even greet us nicely or smiled, very robotic and not at all welcoming. She informed us it's happy hour and told us about what is included AFTER she asked us what we want to drink. Now most places would begin with that. I changed my drink and she was pissed about it. I asked her what is included in their draft beers because at a previous TGI what I ordered wasn't considered part of the promo so I wanted to be sure, she just flipped the menu in front of my face without saying excuse me. My parents had a few questions about the endless apps and the happy hour apps and her responses were rude with an attitude. If it wasn't for my brother's birthday we were going to leave. We did endless apps and my father asked when can we order our second round, rudely (no surprise there) she said until we finish our first round and it said so in the promo menu. Now other TGI actually asked us if we wanna put in our second round orders so it can keep coming and all she has to say was that's not how they do it in their restaurant. I even checked the promo menu she so claimed has the rules and guess what...IT SAID NOTHING ABOUT IT! The service was so slow, we didn't get our drink in 15 minutes later and she even forgot my water.  On a side note we experienced the manager yelling at a bunch of teenagers for not properly tipping their waitress. It was a bit unprofessional, he made a big scene scolding them instead of talking to them with reason and a tone that isn't degrading them just cause they are teens and he's in his 50s-60s. Now I work for tips too so i know how it is like but tipping isn't required, if the service sucks then don't expect anything. Honestly, we left a 13% tip, my friends were shocked I even tipped. But like I said I work for tips so i know tips is important to waitresses however here's a tip, your tip is based on your service not the bill.  No surprise the hostess didn't even greet us good night or thanks for coming. Definitely not coming back here. Save your money and just eat at the chili's a mile down the road. Or if you wanna go to TGI go to the one on Route 1 South or the North locations, they rock!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hazlet-4,,,,,
12,Doug D.,"Toms River, NJ",478,315,654.0,2.0,2017-05-16,"We were on our way through the area and just needed to eat something with substance quickly and did not want to keep looking.  It was a Saturday night, and we didn't plan well, so we knew that we would just take Fridays when we saw it.  It still seemed to serve its purpose for that. Our waitress was actually pretty efficient.  No complaints about her.  She seemed to know the items on the menu and brought everything out pretty quickly. The decor could use some updating.  The floor was also very dirty.  It was bad under the table across from us.  The hostess actually sat a party at that table.  I took a picture. Any bar these days should also have better beers on tap.  Monmouth County especially has so many breweries that are just excellent; however, none of them were on tap.  I ended up getting diet coke because I just will not order bad beer, which is all they had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hazlet-4,,,,,

11,Devon F.,"Cliffwood Beach, Keyport, NJ",359,6,,2.0,2017-07-31,"I don't know why this place doesn't read their bad reviews and try to change their ways. Aside from the wait time, just to put in our order for our drinks, which we only got waters for everyone on the table, the food took a bit long as well. Every one on the table ordered something simple. Burgers. I did as well with sweet potato fries, and with no pickles.  When my food came, there were two long pieces of hair IN my burger. AND my food came with pickles! After complaining, they told us they would bring us another burger freshly made.  Anyway, my hairless burger finally came back, but no sweet potato fries now. They've just given me normal fries.  I don't know why, time and time again, I give this restaurant a try.

10,Jody S.,"New York, NY",16,12,,1.0,2018-01-05,"Consensus appears to be unanimous - service here sucks. Service inside is slow. And takeout service is terrible. This is my second screwed up order ordering from here. Ordered a parmesan crusted chicken entree with two sides - tomato mozzarella salad and mac & cheese, only to get home and find broccoli and mashed potatoes. How disappointing! Called to complain, and was informed that because they are a franchise, their menu does not match the online one. They still wanted to up charge me to get the mac and cheese. Awful customer service. Another instance, I ordered a drink with my meal, only for the said beverage to never be packed with my order. In general, this place sucks and they don't prioritize customers AT ALL. They also mess up orders all the time. WON""T BE BACK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hazlet-4,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
