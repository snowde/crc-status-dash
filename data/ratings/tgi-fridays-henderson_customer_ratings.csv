129,Chris V.,"Henderson, NV",773,898,4988.0,4.0,2012-01-27,"Significantly better experience this time than on my last visit to this location. Sat at the bar area, had my choice of $6 appetizers for ""all day"" happy hour, and finally settled on nachos. It's not the tostada nachos, but I can't remember the name and I can't find it on the interwebs... anyway, there was cheese, chicken, mild salsa, sour cream, guacamole, and a little bit of lettuce. It was pretty good, and it got me full after I had skipped breakfast and gone straight to lunch. I also sampled my friend's Jack Daniels sampler (haha, sampled, get it?), and the shrimp and chicken were both good. Since we changed two variables, I can't figure out if the service was merely lame on the restaurant side on my first visit or if it was some sort of perfect storm of soup/salad/breadsticks overload by my previous table, but my opinion of this place has gone up significantly. Therefore, I'll give Christina-the-server partial credit for today and highly recommend that you sit on the bar side even if you don't personally order a fancy beverage.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-henderson?start=120,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.736

Step #1: Send out 2 for 1 coupon Step #2: Decide that Soup and Salad is not an entree. Step #3 Fail to empower store manager (Shawn @ Fridays on Sunset in Henderson Nevada) to take any action. Just in case a bit more explanation is needed: We received this coupon in the mail OR newspaper, I don't remember which. Also received a free appetizer or desert via email Decided to go to Fridays for hubby's birthday. Knew in advance we can use one coupon or the other but not both. Check to see if our location is excluded. It is not. Order chicken sandwich and ask waiter if there is a soup and salad. We are told yes. Give server coupon and are told that Endless Soup and Salad are not included. Pointed out that there was no endless, simply one salad and one cup of soup. Pay bill, leave tip. Ask to speak to manager on the way out. Shawn (the manager) said ""Well you had ENDLESS soup and salad. That is not included"". Pointed out there was no ""endless"". Showed coupon and asked where it specified no soup or salad. Was asked ""Well what would you like ME to do about it."" Realized Shawn was either clueless or powerless to satisfy the customer.

We asked if we could sit at a small table in the bar area (which was TOTALLY empty) and were told we would have to wait fifteen minutes to be seated. A little puzzled, we asked about getting food while sitting at the bar. Hostess told us that would be fine. We decided to leave. Before we left I asked the Hostess , ""Why the wait? The restaurant is half full?""  Her response was, ""Because my kitchen is backed up"". I said, ""Wait, we can get food without a wait if we sit at the bar, but the kitchen is backed up and you are half full."" This does not make sense?"" She just got mad so we left. Went to Sammy's Pizza in the same area, great food, great service, even a glass of champagne for Mother's Day. We called the manager of TGIF from the restaurant and asked her about the ""wait"". She told us there was no wait and no back up in the kitchen. ""You need to let the hostess know there is no wait"". Manager did not really care.

The children's menu did not include the chicken sandwich listed on the website--when I asked about it, I was told we were at a franchise location, so they don't do the kids' chicken sandwich.

It was pretty empty but I'm sure it's due to it being a Tuesday and in the afternoon. I'm not complaining about that. I love quick service! The bartender was pretty friendly and he reminded me of ""Mr. Clean"" lol. I ordered up a Ultimate Long Island to start me off with the spinach dip. At first I thought the drink was pretty weak as I could not taste too much alcohol. But boy did it creep up on me!!!! -_- The Spinach dip was pretty bland which sucked. I've had much better tasting spinach dip from other TGI Friday's. That didn't discourage me from ordering more though. I ordered the new bacon Mac n cheese bites as well as the all american double burger!!!!! Bam!!!! They're back on track! Did I mention happy hour is 11am-2am so ummm, half off!!!!! The bites are like heaven in a little ball and the burger was kick ass! They certainly redeemed themselves. I topped it off with an Ultimate Margarita and was out the door. Overall, my experience was good. This is Friday's so you get what you get. Nothing fancy but definitely gets the job done. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was due to the spinach dip not being up to standard. Don't hesitate to stop by for Happy Hour. It's a deal!

It was a Thursday night so the restaurant was not crowded.  We paid 10.99 for 2 of the saddest looking and sized crab cakes that was not even big enough to share. It was just lump crab meat mixed in egg whites and pan fried, that really was it. The Friday's shrimp was over priced and left the bf starving. My pan seared flounder had no seasoning, and for me to complain that there is no seasoning is rare since I don't require much to begin with. The steamed vegetables and rice seemed like they were boiled in the same water without any seasoning. In hindsight, I should have ordered a burger, much cheaper but I was trying to be supportive of the bf's new diet. I took a bite of our son's cheeseburger and it was perfect. The bf had to order a salad to take back to the room because he was still starving. We will not be returning and it will probably be a few years before I think of visiting this chain again.

First off service was super slow and everyone around us was served first, including larger parties. Our waitress was in attentive and seemed annoyed with any requests. We ordered 2 expensive dishes with lobster which was Not impressive, but the small steak was pretty good. I ordered a side house salad which was a waste of time and no where near worth the price. I sent it back and had to ask multiple times for it to be removed from the bill. The worst part of this trip and restaurant was with the bill. We asked if there was a military discount and they do offer one but only to the military id holder. EVERYWHERE else literally gives the discount to the entire bill, but nonetheless we were given a small discount to the cheapest entree but nothing else. The manager came over to the table and not only clarified the ""rule"" but made a point to mention that generally they don't give the discount to spouses. I am completely appauld by this behavior and disrespect to the military. Not only will I be sharing this story on multiple review sites I will be contacting corporate. I urge you not to give this place your business. It's not about the money it's a principle and respect. Oh I almost forgot, the manger and waitress acted like the discount came out of their personal check...

180,MC L.,"Henderson, NV",0,2,,2.0,2014-03-24,"My boyfriend and I went to Friday's around 8:30pm on a Friday night. Good time for them to be on their A-game, right? Not so much.  Let me start by saying that during our 15 minute wait to be seated we witnessed the same waitress come up to the host stand about 3 times complaining very loudly about her life, her customers (awkward for us - hope we don't get seated in her section as to not bother her...at WORK) and her job. .......... That's incredibly unprofessional no matter where or who you are. But you can literally tell everybody hates working at this place. It took the server (not the Debbie Downer yay!) about 10 minutes from the time we sat at our table to even greet us and ask if we wanted anything to drink. Time it out. The next time you go to a restaurant see how long 10 minutes really is for the initial greeting. I gave him the benefit of the doubt though...it was busy on a Friday night.  I asked the server if they had alcoholic lemonades. He thought for a second and then said ""no, we don't."" But suggested the ""Electric Lemonade"" some blue drink so I got that. ....I later opened up the drink menu to find a whole page titled ""LEMONADES""  lol yeah I should have looked cuz I definitely had the time but.....maybe he was new. Gave him the benefit of the doubt. We ordered the beef cheese dip for an appetizer and it was pretty tasteless. I only ate the cheese part, but there was barely any beef on it, and the cheese tasted really artificial.  We all know we don't come to Friday's to eat healthy, but if we're going to be fat kids, the food should be worth the calories. Just saying. I ordered the Salmon with langostino lobster on top. ..... I observe Lent so no meat on Fridays...the only reason I ordered salmon at Fridays - let's be real. The langostino was GROSSSS clearly had been defrosted and not prepared properly. it was just mushy and weird. The salmon was decent...clearly frozen salmon. The menu stated it came with a garlic alfredo sauce... yeah it definitely didn't come with that. It was some weird brown sauce with mushrooms that was not even enough to eat each bite of salmon with. Got the mashed potatoes...which tasted more like butter than anything else, and the garlic parmesan steak fries were gross. They were shiny with oil and it pooled at the bottom of the dish. That's not ok. They were clearly coated with some artificial garlic sauce or whatever that made it taste more tart than anything which was really awkward, and the 10 little pieces of shredded parmesan that actually made it on to the fries had no taste. I don't expect miraculous food at Friday's but on a Friday night during peak hours, I expected better than what we got. I would not come back here if it were my choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-henderson?start=180,2.72,2.72,2.72,1.9920000000000002,2.72

As if the experience couldn't get any worse we were looking around at props and the were beyond filthy; looks like the place hadn't been dusted in ages.

Drinks were quick, but she was gone before even asking if we were ready to order, or had any questions, that was the theme of the night. She had 3 tables including ours, it wasn't like she was slammed. Luckily the other servers were a bit more helpful. Appetizer came out, we had no place settings, no plates for the apps, and no server around to ask until it was half way gone. By the time our food made it to the table our son had almost finished his. By this time we had bonded with the table behind us over the terrible service. The food was not terrible, but not great.

It was way less than the picture made it seem to be so the waitress offered to bring the menu so he could order something else but at this point he was so hungry so he decided to just eat what he had. When he ate his burger he was not at all happy with the taste (or lack thereof ) and again expressed it to the waitress in a nice way and acknowledging that he knows it's not her fault. The waitress asked if we would like dessert and of course we declined and i told her we would be stopping somewhere else to grab something for my bf to eat. I expected, at some point, for the mgr. to come over to apologize but no one ever did. I then expected to have his food taken off the bill or, at the very least, to have our 2 non-alcoholic drinks taken off the bill but this was not the case. It was all incredibly disappointing.

We asked for the check and she set it on the table and walked away. I let her know we were ready but she continued to walk away, even after she watched me put the money in the folder.

I odered the bacon onion jam on my burger and didn't get it, I thought. Turns out its not really anything resembling a jam and I couldn't find the bacon. I had so many onions on my burger because I also had ordered caramelized onions. I couldn't tell the difference between them. Ronnie first brought a side of the ""jam"" and then a side of bacon after she saw me trying to pick bacon out of my side of ""jam"". TGIF's really needs to either fix the jam or re name it.  Also their au jus for the French Dip? The onion soup? Really? They can't be bothered to make an au jus?  But the turkey burger itself was well seasoned, if slightly dry, which I expected.

As soon as we sat down we could hear other patrons around us complaining, watched a manager making the rounds.      The table across from us, whom were seated almost 10 minutes after us, were served basically their entire items before i received a water.    We ordered an Angry Orchard cider, an appetizer and two entrees.   Over the course of the next 15 minutes we had completely plain wings brought to us, (which gross btw) not once, but twice, and the waiter insisted it was ours. Finally a table two down yelled, ""those are ours."" No apology for essentially accusing us of ordering some garbage.    Then the bartender walked up with a long island. Again we remarked, its not ours. Bartender sighed. The waitess came over, ""its for this table but they dont want it anymore, they waited to long"" 45 minutes in fact.....     So having still not received silverware, the cider, or childrens chocolate milk in almost 20 mins we decided to walk out. The waitress and manager basically watched us go, didn't even try to approach us.    The experiences here historically have been lackluster, and coupled with the hike in prices, (20 bucks for jack daniels chicken? Really?) I'm pretty sure we're just gonna skip this chain from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-henderson?start=20,3.16,2.65,2.65,1.604,2.854
119,Catalina W. R.,"Las Vegas, NV",605,28,24.0,1.0,2017-02-24,"The customer service here is very VERY poor.  24 February 2017  We were a party of 3  Our server name was Anna ; Table 16.  When we got sat the server Anna greeted it was 2 of 3 us. She handed the menus and disappeared for 15 minutes, came back took drink order, disappeared again.  If its not because we call for her attention only God knows how long more it would have taken to take our order.  We did a very simple order too.  Burger Nachos Beer  Nachos arrived 20min.  No burger.  Burger took 35min to arrive.  3rd person arrived and ordered Ribs. Since we were already upset by then -  I asked Anna how long it would take - she said 15min, I then told her that if it were longer to cancel it.   A bus boy came by and dropped the Ribs - they arrived in 10min. So that was good.  However, no silverware. I had to go to the Host and request silverware.  Anna (server) not once stopped by after taking the Ribs order and having bus boy drop it off.  We had to request our check from another server.  After 10min - still no Anna. We wanted to pay, requested to pay already, the other server was very nice & said she would go look for Anna, thats when we said ""we need to pay now or were walking out"" in that second the server saw Anna coming, she arrived and we paid.  I wrote in the Receipt how poor the service was but still tipped her.  We didnt speak with the manager bcus at that point we were just too over the shit service, we just wanted to gtfo.  I maybe thought Anna was running behind at first bcus it was a Friday night 8pm ish but noticed how the other servers were being attentive w their table. So I was like wtf?  At the end, Anna nicely greeted goodbye, like really? Your service was shit, just go get lost again like you did the whole time.  ...should've checked the Ratings here on Yelp before stopping here.

So why not? :) I had seen the commercials for the all you can eat apps... And I wanted to try it out.  We were greeted right away from the hostess and taken to a table.... Where we waited and waited and waited.... The server didn't come to the table until I stood up to go-to the bathroom... From the moment we sat down to the moment I stood up to go-to three bathroom was about around 8 minutes... Not that long... But not that short either.  And when I told the lady that I wanted the endless apps for my meal she gave me attitude. If that's what I want that's what I want. Geez lady give it a rest. I love apps more then I like entrees... So why not just get apps for dinner? Lol I can't be the first one and I most likely will not be the last.  I got the flat bread app and it was actually good... Just a little crunch around the edge... Chicken was tender and the BBQ sauce added a touch of sweetness that I liked alot. The fried pickles were delicious! I love fried pickles. The only weird thing was that it was like mini pickle spears instead of the food that I was expecting. Then the potstickers well... They were potstickers....Lol what can I say? It was decent nothing to write home about. :) My bf got the grilled chicken entree and he inhaled it. The chicken was very tender and seasoned well. The sides were decent. But he was still hungry as it was only 1 chicken breast. He ended up getting the brownie a la mode which he liked as well. It was a little too sweet for me... Overall the food was decent as I knew it would be. But nothing really stood out to me as something that I would be craving in the near future. The service on the other hand was a total miss. Besides having to wait to place our order, towards the end of my meal, a large table came in... Pretty much after that I did not see the server at all. We had to flag her down to get our final bill and to pay. They had the little machines on the table and for once I wished that it was working instead of having to wait another 10 more minutes just to pay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-henderson,2.76,2.58,2.58,1.9600000000000002,2.652

The food was basically crap. 2 friends and I ordered the 2 off the grill and 2 sides. One of my friends... his Mac n cheese didn't come out when the food did. My other friend, her ribs were COLD. Like they just thawed it out and didn't even microwave it. My sirloin steak (which I asked for medium rare) came out well done but was still cold. The broccoli was just soaking in butter for mine, my friend's was soaking in lemon. The jasmine rice was good. There was a mistake on my order, I had asked for salmon.. I got shrimp.. they didn't bother to put my food on a different plate when they took it back, which sucked because what if I had a shrimp allergy? Meh.. whatever. By the time my salmon came out, everyone was pretty much done with what they could manage to eat out of primal hunger. For that many mistakes, our food took incredibly long for the mistakes to come out.  If it wasn't for KC, I might have flipped as many tables as I could as I left.. but she was so kind and sweet, I couldn't do that to her. She did ask a manager to come out. Dani... come to find out, she's a manager in training. She is probably the most passively condescending individual we encountered tonight. She just had this attitude like she didn't give 2 flying shits about us. She took off one plate. A table sitting not too far from us also were pissed off because their food took 30 mins.. Dave (the actual shift manager) comped their whole meal. My friend was livid. She began to complain how fucked up it was that their entire meal got comped when we had similar issues and ours came with mistakes on EVERY order.

I would NEVER say some crock pot bullshit like that to a customer unless they threatened my family, which wasn't the case. EVERYTHING was wrong with ALL our food.. who wouldn't be pissed upon hearing someone else getting comped and we had to pay. This place is crap.

13,Meesa R.,"Henderson, NV",0,1,,1.0,2017-10-31,"Planned a dinner with all my kids, their significant others and my parents. It was the first time we were all together in a couple years. My youngest son's birthday was last week so I brought him some birthday balloons but had arranged with the hostess and server to surprise him with a cake at the end of the meal. I had come in early to give them the cake and candles. The server and I worked out a signal to let her know we were ready and they would bring in the cake, candle lit, with staff singing happy birthday to him. The manager walks up to our table for some reason just as everybody was getting seated and says in front of my son, ""I saw your cake! It's beautiful!"" Nice enough, but this was a family dinner that we were trying to make into a surprise birthday celebration. Thank you manager. Thank you for ruining the surprise. I was literally done after she did that, I didn't even eat my food. I was so upset. I cried on the way home because this was such a special occasion for ALL OF US, and we were trying to make it even more special surprising my son. I thought, well maybe they'll comp me a soda or something since the manager walked up to our table and ruined the surprise. Nope. Nothing. The service was ok, nothing special. The server did her job, nothing more. She did the bare minimum it seemed. But she was nice. Just not anything special. When the cake was brought out, the waitress literally just walked out with it like she was bringing us a glass of water, she sat it at the end of the table, no singing, I don't even think the candle was lit at that point. I'm so mad with myself for choosing this place to have a special dinner with my family. Between the manager opening her mouth and the failure to follow through with singing happy birthday as had been promised, this was a waste of $196. I don't want to say I'll never go here again, their food is pretty good, but I will never ever plan an event there again. I've been very upset since the manager decided to come over to my table and run her mouth, it took a lot of work to get everyone together. I just wish they would have done better and tried harder.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-henderson?start=20,2.04,2.55,2.55,,2.346

Have been here multiple times for happy hour, endless apps and many other promos and got our orders in a reasonable amount of time.  Not sure what everyone is complaining about with wait times, terrible good or rude servers.  We've come with just two of us to at least 5 and seemed to be no difference in quality of anything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-henderson,2.2,2.57,2.57,,2.422

We had to get a takeaway box, paid and left.  There was no apology for the long wait or for the inconvenience.

10,Sherry R.,"Upland, CA",0,4,,1.0,2017-11-04,"If I could give a minus five stars I would.  This was the absolute worst service I have ever had in any restaurant in my life.. I still can't believe what just happened!  First things first... we sat at our table.  No silverware. Ordered our drinks...first mess up.  Ordered artichoke dip and chips, half the order of chips showed up,  had to ask for more chips. Ordered a second dip... never showed up.  Finally placed our order.  I ordered my meal plus a dinner salad...never got my salad. An hour later the waitress brings us the wrong order.  10 more minutes before she informs us she lost our order... we order again.   She apologized profusely,  promised us a discounted bill and free desserts.  We finally get our dinner and all the vegetables are burnt!  Finish eating and she forgets that we are getting free desserts!  Gives us our bill because the kiosk isn't working...strange, right?  And charges us FULL PRICE!  I'm still in shock!  I can honestly say... I have never been treated so outrageously horrible before... we eat out almost every night... never have I had this bad of an experience.   New management is definitely needed at this restaurant.   If you go here... make sure you're not hungry yet!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-henderson?start=20,2.04,2.52,2.52,,2.3280000000000003

They served us burnt pretzels which we returned , they gave us a  new order which wasn't as bad . We should have left but we hoped it would get better . IT DIDNT . Bottom line our main meals were so bad , our stomachs were killing us while we still were in the restaurant. We literally had to go straight home and both use the restroom . Gross , disgusting .

The prices are thru the roof...the kitchen and staff are stale, salty, and beaten down by their manager. No laughing alliwed...she told me..i said, No laughing is my place from hell and I left. Not Dave or Brian or Ashley or other good staff. But manager hates hearing laughter. Dave laughs a lot. I bet he gets fired next week. Whatever. If you want not to laugh, get lousy service and pay for chemical and sugar and fake chocolate for $100 for family of 4..maybe after a funeral..be my guest.

We got seated and waited 20+ minutes for the waitress to ask us what we wanted to eat and we said we were ready to order everything and she took our drink orders and then walked away so we had to wait another 10 minutes to get our drinks and order our food. We got the food and my moms order was wrong and took 20+ minutes to get a SIDE OF FRIES. We wanted ketchup while we were waiting for the waitress to come back and another table had just gotten up to leave and they had ketchup. My mother asked another server if she could have the bottle of ketchup and the server stopped and looked at the ketchup and then walked away. What the fuck. I'm sitting here eating my food. I'm surprised it's even warm. Very disappointed, I used to love eating here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-henderson,1.8,2.44,2.44,,2.184

102,Robin S.,"Henderson, NV",12,14,,1.0,2017-12-20,"We have always enjoyed going there for the Wednesday rib special. It has been awhile since we were last there so I called first to make sure they still offered the special. I was told they did. There were 7 of us and we were seated in a corner which was so dark we couldn't even see the menu! We adked the young man who seated us to please turn on some lights to which he replied ""oh, the bulbs are burned out."" Instead of offering us different seating, we had to ask him to move us. Strike 1! When we got situated in a more lit area, the 2 children with us wanted to color the children's menus they were given (without crayons). When I adked for crayons we were told ""we're all out of them"". Strike 2! Then the waitress approached and took our drink orders. My husband ordered a coke and when she brought him his drink, she daid ""here's your diet coke"". He said he didn't order diet and she grabbed the drink and as she was walking away, muttered something under her breath. Strike 3! When she came to take our orders, 4 of us ordered the rib special. She told us that the Jack Daniels ribs were $18.99 and the BBQ ribs were $14.99. I replied that's not the special to which she rolled her eyes and said they didn't have the special anymore. I told her I called ahead and was told they did still have the special, which she replied ""well we don't"". Her attitude was beyond rude. Everytime one of us would ask a question, she got nastier and nastier! After taking a census of the table, we all decided to cancel our orders and go somewhere else!  You won't be seeing us again, TGIFridays!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-henderson,1.96,2.43,2.43,,2.2420000000000004

Next, our server Heather was out of this world. Like literally, I think she's an alien! Totally awkward and would always interrupt our conversations. And don't get me started on the feedback or non-feedback we received on questions we had about the drinks or food. And while we are on the food, we should've ate at Wendy's, because then at least we would've had something edible. This place sucks!

Jamie (Host) said that that's the wait it works and we have to wait, when asking why are you yelling in front of the customer she said ""I'm not yelling, I'M LOUD. When asking for the manager (Jeff) he said I will take care of that and THATS IT. We never received an apology and we did not feel appreciate.

To start out we were neglected by our waitress, we saw her 2 times, the last us having to ask someone else to please send our server over.  I ordered the 10oz Ribeye medium and when i got it, it was over cooked and tasted burnt. My husband got the steak and lobster deal and his was over cooked as well. We waited over 20 mins for our waitress to come by so we could send the food back but she was no where to be found. Finally after waiting 30 mins we flagged down another waitress to send ours over so we could pay and leave because i had to head into work. the funniest part was when we asked for boxes she didn't ask if anything was wrong with the food since we boxed up whole meals.  I would defiantly avoid this place. bad service and bad food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-henderson,2.08,2.42,2.42,,2.284
