33,Will J.,"Richmond, VA",12,155,9.0,1.0,2014-06-23,"How do I start with how horrible this visit to Friday's was.  First, being one of only three tables being served, you'd think we'd get fast service. That's not the case. It took FOREVER to get the salad and come to find out the salad comes with the entree. Ok where they do that at? Laburnum Fridays is where! Second, once the meal finally came we were eating cold salad with a hot meal.  The rest was complaining to the manager about EVERYTHING. She had more excuses then I had reasons to complain.  To make this short. The service got worst instead of better after talking to the manager. I watched as people that came in after I did get service from more than one person while we waited being ignored.  Again I asked for the same manager this time to make it very clear that I wasn't going to be ignored and watch everyone around me get waited on. She insulted me by going away and coming back with the check and reduced it by half. I advised her to go back and bring me the full check because I wasn't excepting her attempt to pacify me.  Thanks to YELP I can put them on blast. Used to be a great place to go with friends for drinks but one bad experience can prevent a return visit.  Maybe this will make a difference for someone else to think twice maybe three times before going. Bad experiences get retold a million times thanks to internet & social media.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-henrico-2?start=40,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001

Also oddly unsettling: a uniformed police officer standing guard and patrolling the place.  How rowdy does this crowd get?  Maybe his presence was deterring what would have elsewise been coarse behavior.      I would come here again, but I hope that next time my waitron knows what they are doing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-henrico-2?start=40,1.736,1.736,1.736,1.736,1.736

Parking was a bit hard to find in the busy lot, though my friend and I managed. We were greeted by the hostess who, judging by the speed of her ability to seat us at an empty table, was new to the location. In fact, many of the employees I interacted with that evening seemed new. That should be your first warning sign: poor-performing restaurants have high employee turnover, and thus new employees on a near-constant basis. We waited a while for our server to come over, and when she did she seemed to be in a great rush (a surprise, since from my observation she didn't appear to have more than two tables including us). We made our drink order and she returned with it shortly. We placed our orders (the make-your-own burgers) and I showed her my Friday's card, which is what I've always presented to get the complimentary chips and salsa. She didn't read our order back to us or acknowledge the card and, as expected, no chips came, nor did she make any callbacks before the entrees arrived to allow me to ask for some. Shame. When the food arrived, both of our orders were incorrect. The server didn't even notice this despite delivering the food herself, and she apologized when we pointed out the issues. It took about 10 more minutes to fix the orders, and she got us some refills after the fixed orders were brought to us. The sole positive part of this evening was that the food, once corrected, was excellent. It was clear the orders had been expedited in the kitchen (cheese wasn't fully melted), though it was still delicious and the ingredients tasted fresh and flavorful. A manager stopped by to ask how our experience had been, though decided to do so as our server was almost right next to him, ruining the chance for any constructive criticism to be conveyed. Another employee we hadn't seen before this point brought us a to-go container despite the fact that we were both done with our food. Thanks? Finally we received the check, and I offered her the coupon code from my phone and a manager had to run her through the process of how it worked. We were glad to be paid and out of there. Bottom line, the food at Friday's is actually good, and the coupons offered here make it very affordable, though the poor service makes you wonder if trips here are worth it. Overall: 2.0 stars ----------- Pros: - Great food and decent portions. - Coupons/rewards program makes it cheap to dine here. Cons: - Atrocious/rushed service. - Bar area seemed incredibly loud, glad we didn't eat in that section. - New staff slow down what should be a fairly expeditious experience. - Not much parking in their private lot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-henrico-2,1.92,1.92,1.92,1.544,1.92
42,Jennifer I.,"Henrico, VA",52,14,55.0,3.0,2016-06-06,TGI Fridays is one of my favorite restaurants but the one in Laburnum is starting to go down with their customer service and up keep. Lately they always have a bathroom out of order and not kept clean. The service is not consistent sometimes it's good and sometimes it's not. The dine and drink is good you pick from a certain menus where you get a meal and a drink for $12.00.

We should've realized something was off when we walked into the Very Cold, nearly-empty restaurant and were seated Right Next to a woman having a contentious discussion on speakerphone with her baby-daddy.  With said baby loudly begging for momma's attention-and calling momma 'ugly'. I tried to order a lunch combo (French onion soup and a lunch sized salad), and was told the soup (a printed menu item) was not available. Since I didn't want a house salad and a lunch sized salad for my combo (they have very limited combo offers), I ordered the chipotle chicken salad ($12). Big mistake. The salad tasted like a salt block. I think I found three shreds of cheese, and had two small sightings of what appeared to be avocado. The 'chipotle' chicken was ice-cold and so salty I couldn't even take the uneaten portion as a snack for my dogs. Not to mention the texture of the chicken was mushy. Even the 'tortilla' pieces were Beyond stale. I couldn't, wouldn't eat it. Husband's lunch combo looked like they had pulled it out of a vat of grease...the same stuff they must use to mop the floors, which were somewhat sticky-slick. We got the check and left, full portions remaining on the table. Something we've never done, we simply could not get out fast enough. Needless to say, we won't be back. No way, no how.

Sadly, this was not the case. 1) Apparently they have subtracted from their endless app options (which the server didn't know and had to hunt for a menu that listed them) They also increased the price to $15. Given that you receive a fraction of what you normally would have received AND it takes you forever to get a second round of ""endless"" options... this is a rip off.  2) I had a coupon for a free half rack of ribs and two sides. Nowhere on the coupon does it say I could not order ""upgraded"" sides. Had to pay the difference, which was minimal but it should still say that. The macaroni and cheese was noodles drenched in cheese sauce with a little bit of shredded cheese on top to make it look like they made an attempt. The ribs were burnt and barely there. The onion rings were the saving grace on this plate.  3) When you prebus a table you DO NOT TAKE YOUR GUESTS DRINK. I get the server was not the best but some things are just common sense. And it shouldn't take you 15 minutes to figure out how to process a check. Literally. 15 minutes from the point of drop off to point of payment.
