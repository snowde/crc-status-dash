124,Suzanne H.,"Reston, VA",0,75,,3.0,2012-07-09,"I rarely go to Friday's, service is hit and miss, so is the food.  This time, service was good.  Food was confusing.  We ordered the $10 special, my BF got the pulled pork bbq (which he says is ok), I got the korean tacos (more on that in a minute), he got the ""beef"" queso appetizer and I got the peanut butter pie (we split those two items).  I also got the strawberry lemonade slushy.  What I got was a lot of strawberry something, no lemonade that I could tell, poored over some crushed ice, it wasn't even cold.  Just weird.  The queso was pretty good but the ""beef"" was a small spoonful of what tasted like Hormel no bean chili.  It was good but not exactly what we were expecting.  Which brings me to the Korean tacos.  First, they say they are korean bbq beef.  There were 3 very small pieces of beef in each taco (you get more meat at Taco Bell, no lie).  The asian lime/cilantro/ginger slaw?  It was very soggy and cooked lettuce, with way too much of some flavorless dressing, which poured out of the tortillas, there was so much, you couldn't even pick up the tortilla to eat it, it had a couple of shreds of carrot and a chunk of cucumber.  If there was ginger, lime or cilantro in there, it was definitely hiding.  And this was in no way slaw.  It was salad.  And not even a good one.  I do not like cooked lettuce so I picked it off and just ate the 3 pieces of meat per taco.  Couldn't even eat the tortillas as they turned to mush.  Thankfully, I filled up on the queso and since it was about a gazillion degrees, I wasn't that hungry anyway.  I really would have liked a cold slushie, though.   Anyway, keep expectations low and you'll do ok.  And don't go during a busy time, the service will be non-existent.  If you go during a slow period, it's pretty good.   We'll probably go back, we go there about every six months or so, just for something different.  But I ask myself Why every time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3?start=120,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003

I always hear negative things about Fridays but its really one of my favorite places!!  It was love at first taste about 8 years ago when I got a job as a hostess at the Sterling location.  Although my job only last a year, my love for Fridays has lived on!! Since the Sterling location closed Herndon is the next best location. Food: They have a variety of appetizers such as pot stickers, wings, spinach artichoke dip, tostado nachos, spicy queso,  hummus etc..Their main courses such as cajun shrimp pasta, flat iron steak, caribbean chicken sandwich, sizzling chicken and cheese, and any of the Jack Daniels options(chicken, steak and burger) are DELICIOUS!! Happy Hour: M-F 4-9pm Offers $2 domestic drafts, $3 imported and $4 margaritas, mojitos and long islands. From 4-Close they offer select half price appetizers and after 9pm they have select $5burgers Fridays Rewards: its free to sign up and is awesome to have if you are a repeat customer like me. One point for every dollar you spend which you can later redeem for free food.  Also make your to ask for the free rewards chips..theyre unlimited and yummy! The service there is hit or miss.  One server who does stick out for great customer service and friendliness is a guy named Matt! Make sure to request him! Last but not least...Stop being stingy with the fries when you order burger or sandwiches especially the sweet potato fries(if you notice in my pic, i got about a handful)..

My wife and I went to this restaurant before and we weren't satisfied but that was a long time ago and long before I even heard of Yelp. I honestly feel like this Friday's menu needs to be consolidated or reorganized. They had a lot of stuff on the menu which only confused me. At least the menu should of had a specialty section, that showed me the items they were experts at making, but it didn't.  I also feel like they should denote on their menu which food items are spicy. I say that because my wife isn't a fan of spicy foods so the item she ordered she couldn't enjoy it because it was spicy. She explained to me that it didn't taste bad but she just couldn't enjoy it. It was the same for me, for the item I ordered  however, I'm not bothered by spicy foods so it wasn't as bad for me.  Our server was a little slow at times which was weird because we were here on a Sunday during lunch hours so the restaurant wasn't packed at all.  I don't know what it is about Friday's but no matter what, it seems that our experience is never really that pleasant.  I don't know maybe this place is better for happy hour. The food isn't bad it's just we would like better service and at least someone explain to us that we are ordering an entrée that is spicy since it isn't denoted in the huge menu.

I've been to this location a few times over the past few years and had decent service, but they've since changed their menu and have removed a lot of the lighter options (wraps). It's never been great, but it's definitely gotten worse. All of our food was drenched in grease and oils, to the point the hamburger buns were so thoroughly soaked they were dissolving. When you're eating and notice giant globular pools of grease forming in your food it's rather off-putting and turns you off from eating. Our waitress was a bit of a mix. One of my companions ordered their ""unlimited"" appetizers, but was told right off the board that if he shares one (or we take one) she has to stop serving him completely. Are potato skins THAT important that they need to come with a disclaimer you're going to stop serving us if somebody liberates an appetizer? If I'm paying for his unlimited appetizer and I take one why are we punished? She later came back and told us that her manager was encouraging them to be the food police, but that felt rather awkward. Order a meal, get a warning! At least the warning was complimentary. My wife wanted to try their chicken salad, but it came with cranberries (she's not a fan of 'em). We asked if it was possible to have the cranberries removed and were told it's pre-made, and then our waitress added she's not going to personally remove the cranberries from our order. Uh, okay? We didn't ask you to do that, but that's good to know. In short: bad service, overly greasy, oily food. I figure my pictures can speak for themselves.

My colleague saw a mouse scurry across the dining room floor and the manager did not act like he cared at all. Our waiter seemed concerned but had to go back and request the manager's presence TWICE.  Once he did come out, he was not worried or remorseful. He told us (in a hushed voice) that the mouse comes in from the outside, he was aware and is taking care of it. I would have been grossed out without this reaction, but I understand that it can happen because restaurants are mice magnets. His reaction was inexcusable, however. It did not make me feel confident that he would do anything about it ever. If I were a manager, I would act apologetic and offer a discount or comped a dessert (I have been offered that for less).

94,William T.,"Manassas, VA",0,15,,1.0,2015-02-19,"I went to T.G.I Friday's on Friday evening with my wife, and as soon as I went to the door, There was a guy standing by the door giving us dirty looks, That guy is actually the door man or the body guard that harasses people as soon as they walk to the door, I felt intimidated and was disgusted specially he was starring at my wife. I felt I was at a club not a restaurant. Why do you need a guy standing by the door to harasses people and give them the stair down. I waited 10 minutes by the door and they were not that busy before getting seated, my wife wanted to go, she did not feel comfortable, specially the bodyguard that was standing up with a T.G.I Friday's names badge was standing up giving us the stair down they he sat dawn and he was trying to look up my wife skirt, he figured he can get a better look sitting down than standing up. He was a black gentleman, I think he was wearing glasses. My wife noticed that quick and she said let's go honey, it is not worse it. Finally the hostess, she was in the back flirting with one of the guys in the back. I convinced my wife to sit down, my wife said that this is the last time that she will go there because of the guy standing by the door like a bodyguard or pretending to be security with a T.G.I Friday's name tag. Finally we sat down and the table was dirty, we had to wait ten to fifteen minutes before anyone noticed us, we did not even get silver wear. Finally after waiting 10 to 15 minutes, we told him that we need the table cleaned because it was dirty, he said let me go and to the back and get a rag to clean the table, so we ordered our drink's and waited about 10 minutes before he showed up with the drink and clean the table. The service does not get any slower than that. Finally I ordered the Jack Daniel's Sirloin and I wanted to get it well done, and my wife ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp, we waited about 40 minutes for our food. When I got the streak it was not well done and told the waiter and when I told him he seemed mad and he said that is the best I seen them to, but I will go ahead and try, also my wife's sizzling chicken was over cooked and little dried up, we did not complain knowing the service was bad and waiter might get mad and do something to our food. Finally I got the steak, and they have burned it and it tasted  awful, at this point I just ate the mashed potatoes and vegetable and I just wanted to leave. we asked for the check and the bill was about 49 dollars and some change. I put one hundred dollar bill and the waiter finally come back and first time he smiles because he knows that this is the time that he makes tips and had the guts to ask me if I wanted a change back, assuming I was going to give him a fifty dollars time, I said yes I do need change and his face turned red when he found out that the fifty dollar tip is not for him. finally I got the change back and I gave 5 dollars tip for this lousy, and when he saw that it was 5 dollars, he was very mad and he did not even said thank you form coming or stop back. I will never ever go to this place anymore, this is the worst service I have gotten in my life. If I can I wanted to give them a zero as a score. This guy standing or sitting by the door is very bad, I will never go there because of him. Do not bring your wife or girl friend they going to be harassed by the door man.

In reality, this $12 burger was less appealing than those served at your corner fast food restaurant. Here is the breakdown: The burger was supposed to come with 2 patties, bacon, onions, roasted peppers, sauce and cheese.  The 2 patties ended up being two paper thin slices of beef (both stacked together would barely equal a McDonald's burger that you can get for $1.00).  The peppers were almost non-existent and the cheese looked microwaved.  The bacon was not fresh, and I could tell it was cooked long before I received it.  There was no sauce on the buns and the lettuce and tomato didn't appear fresh. The fries were even subpar.  To make matters worse, they even screwed up my caesar salad ($3.60 extra).  I complained and showed the waiter how horrible the burger looked inside.  Instead of comping the whole meal and apologizing, he tried to defend the restaurant and charged me for the salad.  I highly recommend that you skip Fridays and go across the road to Houlighans instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3?start=100,2.6,2.6,2.6,1.6680000000000001,2.6

Items I asked to NOT be in my burger (like pickles) were in my burger and I had to pick them out. It even took a long time to get the check after it was asked for.  My previous visit here was bad as well. At that time my order took quite long to receive because the kitchen lost / misplaced the gluten free buns. By the time my food arrived, the rest of my party (my boyfriend) was 1/2 way through his meal when he discovered a long hair in his burger.

Two people at the table ordered the Jack Chicken and Shrimp meal for $17 each. The chicken was barely 4oz and the 6 sad looking shrimp appeared to have been microwaved. The Parmesan fries were soggy and the sauce was not pleasant. Additionally, the broccoli that was provided was a just one large piece, barely cooked, and not cut up. Just a chunk of broccoli.  I had the Bourbon chicken meal with 2 sides for $11.  Again a HUGE disappointment with the dry 4oz chicken and undercooked broccoli. The mac and cheese is the only good thing that we had and that was for my toddler.

I can remember my last Friday's meal being overpriced and unappealing. So I ordered a fresh strawberry daiquiri and it lived up to its name! It was light, very fresh and a thirst quencher.Good deal! We also ordered potstickers as a shared appetizer . They come 6 to an order and while they weren't amazing -they were pretty good. An easy appetizer before the grand finale!

This time was no different -I ordered the chicken tenders (yes I'm an adult of 25 years old-please don't judge me ) and subbed the fries for loaded mashed potatoes. Wow! They were better than I remember - the chicken was incredibly hot and fresh-the potatoes were warm with melted cheddar , real bacon, and chives-yum! And you can't visit a Fridays without a side of Jack Daniels sauce. I cleared my plate! My best friend ordered her usual-Jack Daniels Fried Shrimp entree and loaded mashed potatoes as well. I will be returning in the near future to test if this really is an exceptional location or if last night was just a really good night for them!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3?start=20,2.28,2.28,2.28,2.192,2.28

The restaurant itself is clean with totally acceptable decor. The food consists mostly of American bar food and it's mostly solid if uninspired. I will mention that the burgers tend to be pretty low quality given their cost, I would be hesitant to get any burgers or steaks here. The biggest issue is that the service at this location is just incredibly slow. Everything from taking our orders to getting our food out to bringing us our checks takes longer than it should, especially considering there were fewer than a dozen customers in the entire restaurant. It makes for a really frustrating experience when you're just trying to get a quick bite to eat during your lunch hour and it takes 10+ minutes after you sit down to even see your waitress. If you have a lot of time to kill and are craving some fried bar food, then maybe give Fridays a shot.

51,Roger B.,"Herndon, VA",9,141,7.0,2.0,2016-05-11,"TGIF might want to simplify their coupons and deals since it seems to confuse staff at this restaurant. Went here because we had printed out one of their many email coupons. Our waitress told us about the refillable appetizers and some other menu deal. We showed her the coupon we had and asked if the coupon would be valid if we ordered any of the things she mentioned. I know that some of the time Fridays does not combine coupons and menu deals which is why I asked. The waitress took the coupon and went to ask someone and when she came back she told us it was ok. We ordered our food and everything was good. Finished up and asked for the check and it seemed to take a long while. Then a blond haired manager comes over and starts giving us a hard time about how the coupon couldn't be combined with what were ordered, blah blah blah. And I told her that we had asked the waitress if it was ok before we ever ordered anything but go ahead and add whatever to the bill and I'll pay it. She said she went ahead and put the coupon on the check which made me wonder why she was even over there talking to us. If we are getting what we expected to on the bill then their is no problem for us and no reason for a manager to approach us and gave us a hard time. It was nice of her to give us the coupon even though the waitress had told us it was fine. But, we had just finished a nice meal and really didn't need to hear the stuff she was saying. If the waitress or the person the waitress talked to made a mistake, tell them. Not me. I don't work for you and really don't need to hear it. If the coupons are that complicated then come up with a better system. Was def a bad ending to a dinner And now we never go anymore.

After a long time, he wound up ordering a third appetizer, which came out before the second one...it was all very confusing. My other coworker had to ask multiple times for a simple box to package up her food. Everything was just really slow; it took us 90 minutes to have a very simple lunch. Then, the kicker, when we got our check, they didn't comp it after all. They took 50% off, but that wasn't what we'd been told would happen.

36,Kris R.,"Oakton, VA",12,16,1.0,3.0,2017-05-12,"I enjoy TGI Fridays for their massive selection of appetizers and long list of sides.  I only give three stars for this particular location because of problems with the facility.  The store is smaller than it looks so when it's full you're going to be knocking into people at the tables.  The rear section and the bar are several steps higher than the front end and you're rather uncomfortably close to the ceiling.  The ambient lighting is bad because the LED lamps in the restaurant and in the outside seating are randomly pulsing brighter and darker, making the dining experience somewhat psychedelic.  An electrician should pay them a courtesy visit and advise some corrective changes. In the front end of the store the fully upholstered chairs are a tight fit for adult males. For that reason I recommend sitting in the regular padded chairs, booths, and stools.  I have observed the service bar window staff have trouble with the POS equipment on more than one visit, but on a recent visit I see that the POS system has been upgraded to a fancy tablet which is running much more smoothly. I love their food.  It's not heavy and not salty which is a good combination.  The salads are a nice, low-fat, low-calorie alternative after you enjoy the appetizers.  The Million Dollar Cobb salad is only $11 and comes with grilled chicken, making it an excellent and healthy choice, with a very delicious take on the new Green Goddess dressing concept.  It's a true Cobb salad. I should note that I formerly recommended instead visiting the Fairfax location but after my recent visit in Herndon I can say this location has improved, but I still recommend avoiding the tiny upholstered chairs in the front (there are fewer now, replaced with regular wooden, padded chairs).  The Jack Daniels Sampler appetizer is spectacular and I also recommend the half-rack of ribs with Jack Daniels sauce and a spinach side.  The Sampler has a 1/3 rack from what we can tell.  If your party has a ribs lover get them a half rack and get the rest of your party the Sampler.  You will all be happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3,2.0,2.38,2.38,,2.2279999999999998

34,Jen R.,"Manassas, VA",0,10,,1.0,2017-09-14,Service was  horrible! !. Over priced  us. Chicken was dry. I ordered one thing received  another. Went 3 times took 30 minutes  to place an order she laughed and said opps i forgot about you guys. I hate the fact that this is the only one close by. I drive for good service to manassas or tyson mall.  My friends hated waiting 25 minutes  for a beer Each time.

65,Isaac U.,"Fairfax, VA",0,1,,1.0,2017-09-18,"The service fuckin sucks. Last i checked, it doesnt take 20 minutes to bring a glass of water. Also the steak was flavorless without the sauce. My dog eats better steak than what this place serves. Id take the steak home with me and feed it to my dog, but my dog doesnt deserve to be punished. While we waited for the food and drinks, we noticed the waitresses just standing around, talkin to each other while waiting for a simple glass of water. And not to mention it also took them another 20 minutes to bring 2 beers to our table then forget that we ordered another beer.  Mcdonalds gives better service at 3 in the morning than this place. I think its funny how they took forever to get us our food and drinks but the second we want the check, they come back in seconds. Id rank them a lower score but yelp wouldnt let me. In my scale, id rate them a 5 out of 100.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3?start=20,1.92,2.34,2.34,,2.1719999999999997

22,Vikki D.,"Herndon, VA",0,4,,2.0,2017-10-23,"We live near Worldgate & want to add some of the eateries to our Saturday night date night rotation. Since Charlie Changs  closed, not much there that appeals to my guy. He'd seen the ads for ribs at TGIF, tho, and wanted to give that a try. (Those ribs look darn good.) We got there about 5:30pm on Sat. Not too crowded & we asked if we would get served at the bar since we wanted to watch college football. The host showed us to a bar table & said, ""Your server will be right with you."" Fifteen minutes later I went down to the host desk & told him no one had been by. He was very apologetic - could not have been nicer - & assured us someone would be right with us. About 5 minutes later we saw him talking to a man in another area. Tables in that area were being served. The host actually pointed to us, saying something we couldn't hear - presumably, ""They want to place their order..."" - the man nodded, turned & went into the kitchen & we never saw him again, Another 5 minutes & husband said, ""Let's go. Houlihan's is just across the street & we know we'll get served there."" I couldn't argue. Clearly we weren't going to get served. So we walked by the host stand. He was talking to someone & didn't see us.  Guess we'll have to find a Ruby Tuesday's for ribs. PS - Houlilhan's makes a great Southwest Chicken wrap - had one Sat night...:)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3,2.12,2.35,2.35,,2.2580000000000005
28,Allan C.,"Manassas, VA",34,6,,1.0,2017-10-29,Possibly the worst experience at a TGI Fridays. I went there for my lunch break ( i only get 1 hour) ordered my food and drink. I waited 40 minutes after i ordered to ask them to put my food in a box  since it didnt look like it was coming anytime soon. i had no time to eat in there due to them taking so long. After that i still had to wait for them to bring my food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3,2.12,2.32,2.32,,2.24
64,Ana M.,"Reston, VA",172,1,,1.0,2017-11-04,"Worst experience at this location at about 11pm. I came in with my boyfriend to celebrate his 22nd birthday with a few drinks. We got a booth nearby the bar and our waitress was fine. We both ordered a 3$ beer right after our arrival and I just decided to get up and go to the restroom. Another customer came into the bathroom while I was already getting situated in the stall. She burst open my stall and told me to ""hurry the f***"" up"" when I was putting toilet paper down so I could sit down comfortably. This customer sexually harassed me and saw me with my pants down ready to use the bathroom. I left the bathroom and told her I was going to complain. I complained to the hostress. I talked to the manager, Jessica and she let these individuals stay at the bar and told me she did not see anything happen. I left the location extremely upset and called to get Jessicas last name. She did not want to give it to me in reference to place a complain and told me I was drunk on the phone when I was distraught about the situation and I didn't even drink what I ordered because I left as soon as the situation occurred. This manager Jessica is extremely unprofessional and does NOT know how to manage properly. She did not know how to handle the situation. I am extremely offended because I live right next to this location and I loved to go with family and friends during my free time. I will never return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3?start=20,2.12,2.29,2.29,,2.2220000000000004
25,Bobby C.,"Manassas, VA",477,20,78.0,5.0,2017-11-12,I came here with a few friends in October and we just had a few drinks/appetizers. Service was quick and friendly. Drink specials were pretty good and the food specials were not that bad either. This is definitely a good spot to go to before exploring the Worldgate plaza or before a movie night. The patio is nice on a warm night and the bar has plenty of TVs for any sports night. I'd definitely recommend for big gatherings looking for a chill atmosphere!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3,2.28,2.3,2.3,,2.292

However, I had substituted onion rings instead of the fries. For an up charge, I only got three below average sized onion rings?? It tasted like it was frozen and refried a few times. Just AWFUL. Also, the free chips and salsa needs improving. They're stale tasting and salsa is very bland.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3,2.24,2.31,2.31,,2.2820000000000005
