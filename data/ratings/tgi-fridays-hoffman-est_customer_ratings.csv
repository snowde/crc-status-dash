18,Peter K.,"Atlanta, GA",47,412,125.0,2.0,2012-02-25,"I came here for lunch ordering the bottomless soup that comes with salad and bread. What I Liked - The soup options on a Thursday were broccoli cheese and chicken noodle. Both soups were decent. My personal opinion is Progresso's Chicken Noodle Soup is the industry standard for good chicken noodle soup (I know several people that disagree but it's just my opinion). Their chicken noodle soup is right on par. It has some good pieces of chicken meat and the broth is solid. The broccoli cheese is on par with most broccoli cheese soup's I've had. What I Didn't Like - They didn't have thousand island dressing for the salad. - The service took forever to come out. The people that came with me got burgers and my salad came out at the same time as their burgers. I would have expected the salads to come out first. - The soup came out way after the salad and after wanting my second soup, it took 4-5 minutes to get my second soup. There was just too much wait time in between, especially in the time window that I wanted to get my second and third soup. I understand that the waitresses are super busy but still, I'd prefer to be able to get in touch with my waitress a bit quicker than 5 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hoffman-est,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000004
19,Bob P.,"Streamwood, IL",5,45,,2.0,2012-04-30,"Been there on a regular basis for the soup and salad for lunch for the past year.  Service is always interesting. Parts excel, and then staff gets distracted at key points. Often service is over attentive until it comes time for the check and getting the receipt/credit card slip.  Tried their new Reuben sandwich. Lots of good corned beef. Onions were not caramelized yet, and sandwich was not fully warmed up. Spoke to manager and appears that new product is still getting practiced in the kitchen.  Stripes game (loyalty card) has a terrible time getting actual card, or even seeing rewards beyond the free chips and salsa (fresh chips, salsa is very canned tasting).  The Iced tea is in small glasses and is weak by the time it is served over ice. Order refills early.  In summary, a typical 'fern' bar that has ok food with a lot of couponing (watch the expiration dates) with a wide range of food that is all ok. Better then normal in small town, not the best in larger metro areas, but works well for a wide range of tastes and those wanting 'safe' food and environment (read boring for many with any adventure in dining options). Sound system is small number of Bose speakers that leave it a little under powered. The mix is better then most spanning 50 years in an enjoyable fashion of many patrons as not being to 'lame' or to aggressive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hoffman-est,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000004

30,Nicole R.,"Schaumburg, IL",79,198,34.0,2.0,2012-07-13,"I haven't been to Fridays in years due to the fact the quality of it has gone way down. But my sister suggest the place and it was close to home. Our server was nice. We started off with drinks I ordered a watermelon mojito, sounds good and refreshing right? Uhhh no, terrible! Tasted like cough syrup. They took it back and I ordered the Cosmo Patron Shaker, Very tasty but its about $10. We order the pretzel sticks and they tasted like garlic bread sticks, they were pretty good. The plates they gave us for the apps had food stuck to them still... Yuck! I ordered the chicken fingers, which were pretty average. Nothing to complain about. My sister ordered a burger asked for it medium and it came out as well as could be. She couldn't even eat it. At that point she was like whatever lets finish our drinks and leave. Our bill came out to be about $55! For Fridays, really!? Seems a little pricey for 2 people. Now I remember why I don't go to Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hoffman-est?start=20,,,,,
17,LJ D.,"Schaumburg, IL",0,25,285.0,2.0,2012-08-11,"Let me preface this by stating, I am giving this place 2 stars only because of our great waiter Nick.   We were met by 4 young ladies that were literally standing there with their backs toward the door laughing and gossiping.  We were then completely ignored while the guests after us were greeted.  After one of the ladies finally acknowledge us after we walk up to her 5 minutes later we tell them we had called Wednesday (we ate here on Friday 8/10)  and we were to have a table at 7:30 ready for 14.  She turns around and tell us that she will have to speak to the manager.  I kid you not, 15 minutes pass by and all 4 ""hostess"" are still up front - 1 is busy flirting with a young co-worker while 1 is sitting on the bench laughing with the other 2.  We go up and another young lady to ask if our table was ready.  She says ""I'm not sure."" So we ask her if she can go check.  She does.  Finally at 8 p.m. we are shuffled over.   We had the pleasure of being served by Nick which was an excellent waiter.  He was patient and made sure he got our order right along with one of the other waiters.  Our food was delicious and Nick was great.  Additionally, the manager was kind enough to turn down the air vent directly on top of us and came by to check the temp was ok.  Unfortunately the customer service in the front of the house was not professional at all.  Also Management please make sure your female wait staff washes their hands when they leave the bathroom.  I saw 3 go in and walked right past me into the stalls and go straight out the door.  I have no idea if they used the restroom or not, but still - if you walk in there wash your hands!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hoffman-est,,,,,

The one is Schaumburg Woodfield is WAY better as far as preparation and quality. I recommend this place but rather drive extra 6 miles to the one by Woodfield.

16,G B.,"Winfield, IL",0,21,96.0,5.0,2013-01-30,The food is always good and the prices are fair.  You can't really beat TGIFridays (value). The only bad thing is that this place is not really visible from Barrington Rd.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hoffman-est,,,,,
6,Joy S.,"Naperville, IL",576,377,136.0,2.0,2013-06-05,"Friday's has really gone down in portion size and quality, and gone UP in prices. I typically don't have a problem with chain restaurants, but I hadn't been to a Friday's in a while. My husband and I had our first date at this location 4 years ago, so we went for our first wedding anniversary dinner there. Mistake. Customer service is really lacking here. The phone was ringing for several minutes. I watched 3 different employees walk past and let it keep ringing. I was tempted to go answer it myself!  I was surprised when we ordered the peanut butter pie for dessert (that the waiter didn't offer - he offered our check, we had to ask about dessert) at the tiny, itty bitty slice of pie. We wanted to split it, because for $6, we expected a wider slice than 1 1/2 inches. It was smaller than what Bakers Square calls a half-slice.  The only redeeming quality of this meal was the Bacon Mac & Cheese Bites - though I would've liked more than 4 bites for the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hoffman-est,,,,,
8,Roman L.,"Bartlett, IL",32,27,21.0,2.0,2013-08-04,I agree with everyone TGIF's has gone down. Even though the staff was very friendly the food portions are quite small good thing I ate my meal slow so I was not full but satisfied I ordered the dragonfire salmon. It came with broccoli and mango pico de gallo which I tasted the mango only in one bite. It also had like 4 mini mandarin wedges. And the sauce over the salmon was Kung pao sauce. I love salmon and its probably one of my favorite foods but this salmon seemed like it wasn't seasoned at all. It was more of the Kung pao sauce I could taste and there was only two pieces of broccoli.  At the end our waiter seemed like a nice person and I believe due to bad reviews they're trying to make up for it because at the end he encouraged us to go online and give him a rating of 9 or 10.  Maybe ill give TGIF's another try someday but not anytime soon,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hoffman-est,,,,,
7,John S.,"Aurora, IL",126,438,5.0,3.0,2013-11-13,Can honestly say if Fridays didn't have the entree and app for $10 deal there is no way I would eat here. The food at Fridays isn't fresh or even that good really. However the entree and app deal is pretty good for what you pay. If you order the sirloin don't expect steak house quality or you will be disappointed. The comfort food however is good and on par with other chain style restaurants. The service at this location was good. My friends steak was over cooked and they gave them a new one without any issues. The waitress knew right away the kitchen messed up and took care of it. Over all ok food and open fairly late.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hoffman-est,,,,,
29,Jill M.,"Schaumburg, IL",0,11,1.0,1.0,2013-12-03,"I went to the Hoffman Estates Friday's today for lunch.  There was no hostess and I had to ask a waitress to seat me.  The ice tea tasted horrible, not sure if it was old or out of a mix, but it was horrible.  Then the chicken fingers were not meaty like I have had there previously, they were as skinny as my index finger. Lastly the service there was terrible!  I work nearby and the last time I was there had a similar problem with their service but decided to give them another chance.  Bad Choice.  If you want good service and quality food do not go there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hoffman-est?start=20,,,,,

25,Val W.,"Chicago, IL",3,11,,1.0,2014-01-04,"I took my step-mom & sisters here because location close to home.  Three of us ordered a seasonal Blackberry Long Island, but when we received we were sure we received a Margarita. The waiter tasted one of them with a straw and took them away. A few minutes later the manager walked up. I was thinking it was to apologize. No, it was to tell us if we reordered the drink again it would taste the same and it tasted nothing like a Long Island because it contained their ""special"" sour mix.  Mind you the drink was called a Blackberry Long Island and not a 1/2 and 1/2. The response was very passive aggressive & when we said that it was fine to keep our original order, he actually BROUGHT OUR ORIGINAL DRINKS BACK that were taken away from the table.  I am sorry, isn't that unsanitary and probably against the rules? After the manager tasted one (he didn't seem phased when we told him that either). YUCK. We were a little in shock. I know this is Corporate but I have never had a manager worry more about the bottom line & not instantly replace the drinks or at the very least not charge for them. In addition the waiter was forgetful later bringing me the wrong beer.  There's are a few privately owned options nearby, I am sure the experience would be 100% better.

The hostess was very nice and so was our server, but he was so inattentive, it completely diminished the great burger I had. The portion sizes have definitely decreased. Our server, Nick, never asked if we wanted water or ever bothered to check on us after our food was brought to us. We had to flag him down every time we needed something. Never once did he check on our drinks. Although he was nice, we were still really disappointed with his lack of hospitality skills.

I mean, the appetizers were pretty ok, the green bean fries were ok and so were the potstickers, but I didn't like the loaded potato skins or their hot wings. Also, I had their bleu cheese burger which was literally two thin, dry patties of meat with tons of salty bleu cheese that tasted awful. I can't stand dry burgers and this one was dry and the flavor was bad. Some of the other people I was with had their pasta and that was actually decent, the ribeye which was pretty meh, maybe a little below, and then we had the Oreo dessert which to me was the only thing I actually liked, I don't know if its because I love Oreos or what, but it wasn't too sweet and it was nice and cold and crumbly. However, mixing some Oreos and ice cream and having it taste good doesn't garner it another star, but all in all, I wouldn't really come back to this place unless I was desperate for a late night meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hoffman-est?start=20,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6

I must say it was delicious, perfect noodles with a creamy spicy sauce, perfectly cooked natural (according to the menu) chicken and perfectly snappy shrimp.  I must say I was very impressed. I also sampled a pot sticker from my friend and I am impressed, very authentic, tastes like real chinese pot stickers, crispy outside with a perfectly textured inside.  I think the slowness and lack of unique foods is the reason I am not a super fan, but the food was very good.

1,Rob W.,"Oak Park, IL",194,819,11.0,3.0,2014-12-13,"I really should rank this place higher than three stars based solely on my visit, but I just can't. To me, TGIFriday's are the epitome of mediocrity if that's even possible. I went with co-leaders from the Care Center that I volunteer at. It was after 1PM on a Tuesday, so the restaurant wasn't busy. We were seated immediately. I was in the mood for a burger and after perusing the menu settled on a Jack Daniels burger - the draw with this is the Jack Daniels sauce. I liked how the waitress asked ""pink or not pink"" with reference to the cooking temperature. This actually generalizes it a little and makes it easier for the restaurant to cook it right and satisfy the guest. It actually came out REAL pink - at one point, I'd say nearly raw. Now, I don't mind that at all, but I would venture to say that a lot of customers would have had issues with that burger. Overall, the burger was OK, but there were two things I didn't care for. First, the bun was flat - nothing to it from the outset. Second, the sauce, while nicely flavored is quite thin and just runs right off the burger. Putting it on the bun or trying to dip the sandwich isn't an option due to my first issue - the flat, non-existent bun. Fries were OK, but not as plentiful as I would have liked. The waitress was pretty attentive - I thought she was about to ""strand us"" with our checks and payments waiting inside the books, but just when it was about to be a little too long to wait for her to pick them up, she did.  So that was pretty much it in a nutshell. A few of us did split a Brownie Obsession for dessert - that was pretty good. I might be back sometime in the coming decade, but it will likely be for a similar kind of lunch. I was just counting my blessings that we went there rather than Chili's across the street - that option is even lower in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hoffman-est,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36

I had the classic cheeseburger. But asked to swap the American cheese for the sharp cheddar. They got that part right, but had bacon on it. Blah...not too fond of pork. So I gave it to my sister. She loves their bacon. Their Strawberry Slush Lemonade was awesome! I had to order a second. Portion size is average, not too much, but I believe it's a good amount for everyone to have.
