One Sunday before going to see a movie, my friend and I decided we were going to grab a bite and chose Friday's as we both had said ""decent food, quick, and we have not been there in awhile.""  What a mistake!  Unlike most of my other experiences at a Friday's (which was pleasant), this one was NOT that way.    AWFUL service, awful food, and awful environment... we joked that we felt like we were being served lunch in a women's prison.  Terrible!  The area they sat us in was filthy and loud and they had just opened and they were not busy.  My friend's order was completely wrong and they comped her an iced tea (what kind of a manager does that?).   Needless to say, after this experience, I will not be back to this location, but I will definitely explore the others in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-homestead-3?start=20,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.0840000000000005
32,J D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",4,233,39.0,4.0,2013-04-23,Haven't been to TGIFridays for years and was never really a huge fan. I get tired of going to the same places all the time for lunch so we decided to try it out. I must say that I was very impressed with how extensive the menu was and all of the delicious options. I had the two for $10 lunch special with French onion soup and terriakyi glazed chicken strips. I was told that the broccoli soup is very thick so I opted for the French onion. It was okay but I think that I would get a salad instead of the soup next time. The chicken strips were wonderful and I am still craving them. The portion was huge and there were leftovers. My co-workers ordered the Jack Daniels Sampler and burgers and were jealous at the portion and choices from the pick two. The service was good and we had no issues. I will definitely be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-homestead-3?start=20,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48

My wife and I won a gift card in a raffle.  We went for lunch on a Saturday. It was not crowded We entered the restaurant and were promptly seated by a nice server.  The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated and did not feel run down or old in any way. Our server took our drink order and returned promptly.  We got the pretzels with beer cheese appetizer and we each got a hamburger. Our food arrived promptly and the appetizer was ""fine"".  10 years ago I would have called it good or better but time has marched on and expectations are higher then they once were. The same goes for the main course. The fries were unremarkable but decent as were both burgers.   The bill was also fair.  The meal with two drinks and an appetizer was reasonable for what we got. The server was pleasant and attentive. All in all this Fridays as a good but likely quickly forgotten experience.

I order the Jack Daniel's chicken and shrimp with just fries. The fries were undercooked and thrown haphazardly into the sauce holder. The shrimp was over cooked and just deepfried. The chicken was fatty and just tasted like it came from their freezer. Even the water tasted weird. Fortunately, we had a very nice and charismatic waiter and all of the staff was very friendly.

Took 30 minutes for our waiter to show up and we just order both drinks and food then. Took another 30 minutes to just get our drinks (2 beers on draft) and tables who were seated after us were served much faster then us. Finally our food came (soup, salad, boneless wings, and fries). A different server delivered the food and it looked like it had been sitting out for awhile. After being given our food we were completely ignored, along with others in our section. Us and two other tables waited over 45 minutes just to try and ask for our check (one table just got up and left!)  Being a server myself, I try to be very understanding to the wait staff.

19,Larissa G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",124,575,1132.0,3.0,2015-03-30,"A T.G.I. Friday's is a T.G.I. Friday's. You either like it or hate it. This location is pretty standard; it has the expected mash-up of decorations around the walls that try to give the place a laid-back lounge feel and there's nothing outstanding about the menu or what they offer food wise (and like other Friday's, it's not particularly easy to eat here if you're anything other than a meat lover). Honestly I wasn't expecting to eat here any time soon; I had called a few days before eating here while planning a day out with friends and asked about reservations for a large group (as it says on the T.G.I. Friday's website that it's ideal to call ahead when you have a large party). However, I was told on the phone that this location does not accept reservations. So my friends and I looked elsewhere, and finally walked across the street to Friday's after discovering just how darn long the waits at other restaurants were. At least Friday's only had a 15 minute wait. Once we were seated our meal went by pretty uneventfully. I remember that we had to repeat ourselves a lot to our waitress and I had wondered why she was having trouble hearing us, but at least she was willing to ask questions and clarify things as opposed to taking a potentially wrong order back to the kitchen. Kudos. The food, as I mentioned earlier, was standard T.G.I.Friday's. Nothing particularly wrong with it, just not that exciting either. I had actually found one of the only low-calorie items on the menu at the last minute - a steak and vegetable dish - and standard or not I was honestly pretty happy with it. My steak was surprisingly juicy, came out fairly pink and was not overcooked at all (I'd ordered a medium temperature steak), and the simple and tasty vegetables offered a nice alternative to some of the other excessive dishes I saw on the menu. Not that that mattered after I ordered a rum punch cocktail, which mixed so much rum, fruit juice, sprite and other sugary beverages together that my teeth probably rotted a little bit in my head. It was worth it, though - that drink was a sweet, tall cup of Heaven. This T.G.I.Friday's really fits my exact definition of an ""a-ok"" place - it's not terrible, nor is it not exceptional. It's just a decent place to grab a bite or to enjoy a drink. I'd consider coming back again, but admit that they wouldn't be my first choice so much as a solid back-up plan for when other Waterfront eateries are super busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-homestead-3,,,,,
31,Paul K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2,32,82.0,2.0,2015-04-10,"I understand its a chain, and pretty standardized everywhere you go, but I found this location to be especially bad. First, when you walk in the restaurant has a very stale grease smell that permeates throughout the restaurant, nothing visibly dirty, but smells like the entire joint needs de-greased. Second, the service, the host was a typical younger girl, efficient without too much professionalism, not a big deal. The waitress, a ""professional"" , but unfortunately not in the way of experienced great service, but moreso as experienced in efficiently moving things along.  Our food took a long time, and she 'saved' herself by telling us that she didn't know why our food wasn't ready yet, but would check again, and of course, hot plates with luke-warm food came out soon after. She reeked of cigarette smoke, so i'm going to make a dumb assumption and guess that's where she was.  The food, typical TGI-fridays food, good enough, for a chain restaurant.  Extremely unlikely that i'd return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-homestead-3?start=20,,,,,

We were seated quickly and our server came over quickly. There was only one other table that had people in the section we were in.  I ordered a Jack Daniels burger-cooked medium. Our food came quickly. My burger was well done and dry. Without the Jack Daniels sauce there was no flavor at all.  The fries were pretty good.

We got the all you can eat appetizers for $10 but now you can only get refills on the same appetizer you ordered. Whereas in the past, you could change the appetizers you ordered. So we got loaded potato skins which was delicious. The skin was crispy and the potato was soft and the cheese was so good! The bacon bits were crispy!  We trie jack Daniels and barbecue boneless wings. The jack Daniels were my favourite. They were sweet and crispy!

3,Brenda W.,"Monroeville, PA",211,577,835.0,5.0,2016-04-20,"Today we dined indoors after a bike ride on the rail trail.  I realized I'd never been inside before, only out on the deck facing the trail/river.  While I love the outdoors and would always choose that first, it wasn't available today so inside we go.  This particular Friday's is nice inside with space between tables.  The one in Monroeville seems quite a bit more cramped.   The purpose of this update is to brag about their burger.  OMG! This was the best burger I've enjoyed for quite some time.  I've been to specific burger joints that just simply try too hard and either I've had bread components that fell apart immediately upon being held or various edible entities on the burger that just didn't go well together or overpowered the burger itself.   Here, I opted for the ""your call burger"" in which you select a cheese, a spread, and 2 toppings for 11.95 and it comes with fries.  I opted for Smoked Gouda for my cheese, the Truffle Aioli for my spread and Onion-Bacon Jam and Crispy Cajun Onions for my toppings.  Note that the spread comes on the side which is nice as I didn't use very much.   Again, let me rave about it and tell you this is the best burger I've had in a long time.  The burger was moist and juicy and well-complemented by the cheese/toppings/spread/bun.  I ate every morsel plus the fries plus a small side salad and was a happy diner. That is all.  Thank you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-homestead-3,,,,,

2,Huyen D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",398,175,415.0,2.0,2016-08-13,"When I heard about the return of endless apps, I was hooked. When I heard they implemented endless options, I immediately grabbed my wallet and ran for the nearest TGI Fridays.  Unfortunately, a bachelor's degree did not prepare me well enough to figure out that a Friday night at Friday's would be a crazy, chaotic mess. We were seated immediately, but our waitress was so occupied with 10 other tables that service suffered; however, she was very friendly and checked in on us as much as she could.  In our first round, I tackled the BBQ Chicken Flatbread (minus the chicken) and the ""Crispy"" Green Bean Fries. The flatbread was satisfying only because I was chewing at my own foot by the time the food came, but it definitely tasted like a nuked frozen pizza. Nothing was worse than the soggy, oil-soaked green bean fries. I will finish any disgusting food before I see it go to waste, but even I had to draw the line. Throwing in the white flag on this one. My second (and final) round were the Loaded Potato Skins (minus the bacon). Super crispy outside layer, but the inside tasted like a raw uncooked potato. My boyfriend breezed through four plates of boneless wings and pot stickers. The only wing flavor he enjoyed was the sriracha buffalo, while the others ranged from okay to downright disgusting. The skin to the pot stickers were so dry and chewy you could barely bite into it.  To summarize - do NOT go for the endless apps. Yeah, I saved a couple bucks, but aside from feeling like a human grease ball afterwards, nothing tasted remotely good and I wasted hours of my evening sitting in a loud, filthy restaurant.

I selected no cheese for my lactose intolerant husband, but he had to scrape two slices of cheddar off his patties.

We waited about 15 minutes before our server Brittany introduced herself. My husband ordered a Long Island and endless apps which you choose 3 out of a list in addition to him ordering a burger and everyone else also ordering meals. My daughter received her salad but was not given silverware so after waiting about 10 minutes I went to the hostess stand and asked for some because at this point she is eating with her hands lol. The hostess comes back to tell me they are rolling it and they will bring it over. A couple minutes later out waitress tosses them on our table and walks away and a food runner drops off our mozzarella sticks. The mozzarella sticks were so cold the cheese was already congealed in the center but at this point we did not care since we have been there for 50 minutes and we were just ready for food. About 10 minutes later another food runner brings out meals. We still haven't seen our waitress and my husband was never asked for another drink so he's drinking my water. I explain to the food runner we still haven't received our other apps in addition. The runner must have told our server because our server comes back and states she has to wait until we finish our first app before she can place our second app in the computer and she is still waiting for them to come out. It at this point was a good bit of time ago. I asked for boxes because we were now there over a hr and just got our food, my children are now cranky and my husband and I were so frustrated. She comes over and throws the boxes on the table no apologies and said she's gonna bring our other two apps out and she'll be back. She came back and put them on our table and handed my husband the check. I wanted to speak to a manager but my husband was so aggravated he just wanted to go.

They just aren't any good. First problem... The membrane was still on them. Big no no. Second problem, they had to have them sitting in water to get them to where you could pull the bones apart. This takes flavor out of the meat and that was evident. And speaking of meat, there's the third problem. Where is it? I buy a rack of baby backs from the store, I can eat maybe 4 of them. Here?

This is the first time at the location, usually i go to the one in Washington, PA.  After being seated, our waitress came up to out table and we ordered an appetizer, dinner and drinks.  Well we waited and waited, our appetizer never came, but our dinner did.  I ordered the ribs, and my daughter the marinated chicken sandwich.  After taking a bite, she didn't like the texture of the chicken, (tasted like it wasn't cooked all the way though) So we asked for another one. After waiting sometime, they brought out another and was told that this is how it tastes, a rubbery feeling.  So she changed her order to fish and chips.  The waitress brought out shrimp and fries.  At this point we both were disgusted with our service and asked for a manager. Again after waiting sometime we spoke to Megan, who was understanding and somewhat helpful.  They took off the chicken and appitizer, but honestly i shouldn't have paid for any of it, including my ribs, which were average.  She then proceeded to type me a letter starting that i can get $25 worth of food, at that location.  Again i called and told her that i don't ever go to that one, and have no desire to return. why couldn't you had just given me a gift card?  She then said she would call the washington location and give them my name, but why?  I wasn't heading there at the moment!  Very unprofessional, and i even called my oldest daughter who worked for Outback and she was livid, agreed i shouldn't have had to pay and got a gift card.  She also give the the DM name which i plan on reaching out. I could have and should have went to burgatory.  Much better service.  Never had this problem in Washington, which i have gone to for 7 years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-homestead-3,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

My friends and I went to celebrate a birthday where we ordered endless appetizers. Each app took over 45 mins to come out. The waitress was inattentive and unconcerned with the quality of service we were receiving. When she went to refill drinks she reused the same cups and ended up giving the wrong cups back to each of us at the table. One of the boys was given cup with a straw that had my lip stick on it (just to show how oblivious she actual was). The manager was less than concerned with our complaints and offered nothing for our less than satisfactory experience. After waiting to be seated at a table for 45 mins that was already open, waiting over 2.5 hours for our meals and the things mentioned above I wouldn't recommend going to this TGI Friday's & if you do I hope your experience was better than mine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-homestead-3,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
1,Susan T.,"Monroeville, PA",79,419,861.0,2.0,2017-07-30,"We got there and the hostess was having a conversation with a co-worker. A long enough conversion that Friend and I thought maybe we were invisible.  While we waited, I used the restroom, which was badly in need of service.  Leaves were blowing around the waiting area.  Service was friendly and not good.  Our soup never arrived.  My steak salad was good. Friend's Ribeye was cold, sweet potato fries were colder, broccoli steaming hot. So apparently that's what the hold up was... Dessert?  No thanks. We had a BOGO coupon for dinner.  You should say no thanks, too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-homestead-3,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
0,Sammi A.,"Pittsburgh, PA",58,30,50.0,5.0,2017-12-09,I ordered the Jack Daniels chicken and shrimp. My meal was really good. We had a party of 10 and our server was friendly and efficient. Everything was correct and really good. The restaurant was really clean too! Our reservation could have been ready faster than it was but with a large party you can't expect miracles.  Overall I would recommend this establishment to others.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-homestead-3,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
