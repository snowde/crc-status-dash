We only get an hour lunch break, these people should automatically assume this by looking at our work attire and the fact that a group of 12 are out together at 11:45 on a Tuesday. It took them 5 minutes to set up the tables, 10 minutes to bring our drinks and take our orders, 45 minutes to bring the food...OH...lunch is over and we still haven't eaten. 10 minutes to figure out the check(s) situation. What a mess! Won't be going back to Friday's any time soon. The food isn't even that good.

I've been to this location several times but after this last visit im coo', never again! I'm tired of every time i go here sometimes the drinks are good then the next time the drinks are terrible. Im also tired of spending money on drinks that aren't consistent. After this last experience over the weekend, that was the final straw for us! I gotta tell you, this had to be one of the Worst Top Shelf Long Island Ice Tea's I've ever had in my life by far! Basically, it was like drinking Bad Cough syrup in a glass full of ice, so i just had to spread the word before you spend $10 on a watered down or strange tasting concoction you can find in your medicine cabinet!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston-4?start=60,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001
30,Tish P.,"Houston, TX",908,408,1021.0,4.0,2012-08-09,"It appears management has changed, thank the Lord! Totally different experience this time around.  Coincidinky? I thinks not. Waitress was great, I suggest you ask for Alexis if you go in the near future of this posting. She was attentive, sweet, and very on the job. She offered my dining partner, who's a 100% total veg and not planning on eating there, an extra salad that the kitchen made in error. That was nice to offer and she absolutely loved the salad, had a good balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  I had the Pick 3, fried mozzarella sticks (always yummy) and tried a new dish, the korean steak tacos. They were surprisingly really good. idk about how authentic, don't even care. Considering it's a chain restaurant, not expecting much authenticity so my tummy and taste buds are all that matter in this review and they were singing some (fusion) group's little sweet ethnic tunes. Picture 3 corn tortillas nestled in a wire rack and filled with tender flatiron steak, cucumbers chunks, and topped with ginger-lime slaw, lettuce mix which included some greens that were too strong/bitter for my taste, basil and sriracha. Overall the dish had a sweet and spicy component, but not overbearing on the spicy at all.  It also comes with a side of jasmine rice pilaf. Bottom line: delish My dessert was the salted caramel cake, also a newer offering that I had never tried before. Sinfully delicious. Orgasmically delightful. Just damn good. Sweet and salty, moist vanilla cake layered with vanilla bean pudding and caramel crunch. A flake of thin caramel stuck on top had that candylicious crunch. Comes with a scoop of ice cream and all drizzled with a salted caramel glaze. Good googly moogly, this was EASILY the best dessert I've ever had from there and I'm a total fan of the vanilla bean cheesecake and the brownie obsession when they make it right!  I'm glad I gave this location another try...it was many moons better this time around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston-4?start=20,2.064,2.064,2.064,2.064,2.064

This particular Fridays happened to be packed full of screaming babies! I kept this separate from my the two star rating.. but some people just might not want to eat somewhere while six babies are crying. A very generic menu: burgers, pasta, chicken, steak. Mediocre food for everyone! The drink selection is also generic, but who goes to Fridays for the drinks? When I ordered my Chipotle Yucatan Chicken Salad the waitress warned me it was a very big portion. I thought I could handle a large salad, but I did not think she meant three times the size of my friend's Skillet Garlic Shrimp dinner. Seriously, his was a child's sized amount of food. Rice is cheap and filling.. how was there not more?? Our waitress did keep a smile on her face and our water glasses filled. That alone earned the two star and, even with that, she disappeared for quite awhile after we had passed her our card. Sitting and waiting for your payment (with screaming babies) was a thumbs down. Overall~ Before we even hit the door to leave, the two of us agreed  too expensive for the food  and not a place we will return to eat dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston-4?start=20,1.832,1.832,1.832,1.832,1.8320000000000003

Appetizers: Tuscan spinach dip , everyone like it. and the Tostado nachos which also everyone liked.  entrees: Pick three for all which is an appetizer but I had it as my lunch,  sizzling chicken and shrimp; which mom really enjoyed. Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta, Hibachi skewers; dad like it. Chicken Florentine Piccata Pasta, crispy chicken tenders and mac and cheese which the kiddos like.

I have to say I wasn't too disappointed, except for the slightly poor service and VERY pricey beer. I paid $6 for a Sam Adams and our waiter placed the wrong order and was very slow on getting anything going.  Aside from that, I was happy with the food. We ordered a special that allowed us to choose 3 (of 7 items to split for $15. Fried Mac and cheese balls, roast beef sliders and steak skewers came out quickly, tasted great and filled us both without being TOO much food.

76,Alyssa R.,"Houston, TX",4,4,,1.0,2013-08-03,"I haven't been to Fridays in a very long time. Just recently, I went to this location and it was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had. The place was dead. We waited for about 5 min to be seated when the entire restaurant was empty on a Tuesday afternoon. I ordered an alcoholic beverage and I was a little confused when she brought it to me and I had to mix it myself. Before I mixed it, my grandma stole my drink and took a huge sip. I was waiting for her to say something about tasting straight liquor (vodka and rum), but she said all she tasted was mango. After I mixed it, I tried it and couldn't taste any alcohol at all. I don't ever drink so I should have been able to taste it right away. I thought maybe they just mixed it really good, but there just wasn't any alcohol in it. Once I told the waitress she said she didn't know what to do and asked if I wanted the bartender to come to the table and tell me how he/she mixed it. I said no and asked if I could just get a cherry limeade instead. After waiting about 10 min I finally got my drink and it was the most disgusting cherry limeade I have ever tasted. It was just straight like juice with red food coloring. When I told the waitress she said she was sorry and said the bartender must be having an off day. After two bad drinks I just decided to get a water.  I don't eat beef so when I ordered my nachos I asked if I could replace the beef and substitute it with chicken and I didn't want any beans either. She said she wasn't sure if they could do that but she would ask. It turns out, they can't substitute beef with chicken and so I had to order something else. So I ordered some chicken tenders. After waiting about 45 min, we finally got our food and it wasn't very hot. Nobody was pleased with their food so then the manager came out.  When my grandma told him that we didn't like the food and I had two bad drinks and had to order something else after I had ordered, the manager Ernesto said, ""well that's rude of you to say. Whats the problem? What do you want me to do about it?"" He was very rude when he said it and his body language was showing that he was mad and aggressive. He argued and never apologized for anything. When I asked for the district managers name and number, he refused to give it to me. It was a horrible horrible experience and I will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston-4?start=60,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000004
85,Matthew S.,"Houston, TX",31,80,154.0,2.0,2013-09-21,"It's a Fridays, you been to one you've been to them all. It's kinda like the McDonalds of bars. You know what you're gonna get going in. The food is the same, not the best, not the worst. The beer is typically over priced. So the only thing that separates one from the other is the service. I know it was 4pm on a Saturday but there was no hostess. The bartender didn't offer me a menu so I had to wait ten minutes just to see it because after she got my beer she disappeared, and when she got back I had to ask for it. I've had similar experiences at other Fridays where it's not busy but the staff seems like it is. So I guess it's hit or miss. I really only came in because I didn't feel like dealing with all the mall traffic at the moment. There's better places to go, I'd go there unless you really like Fridays for some reason. Maybe you believe their commercials where it's all happy people having a good time. Right now it's family's with kids. In the bar area.

This has never been an issue through all the years that we have been eating at Friday's, specifically this location. The hostess brought out the manager who explained that I could still order the drinks, I would just have to walk from the main dining area to the bar and pick them up myself. The problem with that is that it wasn't a good place for my husband to watch the game. I can understand not wanting screaming children running around the bar section, but, as I said, we've never experienced a problem with this before.

To my delight I uncovered a hideous contraption most refer to as a 'craft beer burger.' The fries were cold and tasted like they were old. The beef quality was that of an old Flanders or BAR-S beef patty. The buns, reminiscent of a cheap grocery store brand. The cheese was lukewarm, and to top it all off, they sprinkled 3 pitiful little things I couldn't quite make out. At first I was thinking shrimp, maybe raviolis? No. Battered peppers. I'd hate to compare what TGIF FRIDAYS gave me to, oh say, jack in the box. But for someone to charge 12 dollars for a 'craft beer burger', and provide something less flavorful and pleasant than somewhere as shitty as jack in the box, which I absolutely despise.

The manager came over and I explained and showed him the rotten lettuce and he said, ""that's not lettuce, that's spring mix, so I don't know."" Hahaha, I almost laughed at him, poor guy didn't know that spring mix IS lettuce. I politely told him it didn't matter what type of lettuce it was, the fact that it mushed and smeared between my fingers was disgusting. He comped the salad. The bf ordered the French dip and was disappointed, the jus was also the consistency of a thick gravy, not thin as it should be.

Food, drinks, and deals but they are all Bar and Grill restaurants. I thought TGI Fridays will be a little different and it was, the fact that their food portion was small nothing like the menu pictures. Pure false advertising. That kind of threw me off for a big price. The burger was rather smashed down to make it look smaller and it was a small amount of fries.  Though the burger itself was really good. The burger was the Philly stacked burgers and I believe it should be called Philly smashed not stacked.  The service was so so, needs a little working on.  I first waiter (a women; waitress) acted like she couldn't hear. She was unresponsive to all the orders. We literally had to keep repeating ourselves to her. She was getting kind of frustrated and eventually sent us to the bar area to dine. I guess cause she didn't want to deal with us.  Our next waiter (a man), was really nice, funny, and had bar knowledge. He was precise and honest. When we wanted to know something about a particular drink to match our taste. He was straightforward and seemed like he did a lot of research on the beverage.  All of us had a pretty good time. Just do not order Long Island iced tea. I'm not sure if the bartender was having a bad day or if he knew how to mix a drink.  The alcohol in the tea itself was too strong. There was no bearable way to taste the tea.  It wasn't sweet and it wasn't sour, it was just pure alcohol it's like they just dumped all of different alcohols in there.  I and another person ordered it but ended up being a waste of $7.

67,Chris B.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,2.0,2015-11-08,"I'd like to start off my review saying I love tgi Fridays recipes. Their Cajun Chicken and Shrimp Pasta, and the Sizzling Chicken and Shrimp are my two favorite dishes, and that is the reason for the 2 stars. My boyfriend got a $25 gift card for his birthday card so we decided to go there yesterday.  I ordered the Sizzling Chicken and Shrimp and my boyfriend the Mahi Mahi, and 2 sides, spinach and mashed potatoes.  We had to wait for a while even though they were not that busy. My chicken was not Sizzling (I've had this meal many times before at different locations and you actually hear the hissing sound, see the smoke and it's very hot!)....yeah, it wasn't like that, the chicken was dry and over cooked. But you'd think that's my reason for the bad review...not at all, I'd let that one pass by, I'm seriously not that picky. Now on to my bf's meal...So remember I said he ordered the Mahi Mahi (fish!)...so they bring him Chicken!! They made it look like it was the Mahi Mahi, on top of that wood plate. What kind of cook or chef doesn't know the difference between chicken and fish?? So the waitress blames the 2 other ladies that actually brought us the food, explaining they got someone else's plate (lie #1)...it had the sides he ordered and it looked exactly like the Mahi Mahi meal except for it wasn't fish. And if that was the case then where's his plate??..So ok.. She puts the new order in and comes back "" they're already making and it will take less than 3 minutes""(lie #2)...The manager stops by our table, apologizes and says he will not charge for my bf's meal.. We thought ""lets be positive about this, at least they are trying to fix the problem"". I started eating mine since it already wasn't that hot to start with... It took about 12-15 minutes for them to bring his food, by that time I was already finished eating mine (he helped me)...and the waitress reaffirms that his meal would be taken care of because ""no lady should have to eat alone"" as she took my plate back to the kitchen. So when she brings the check $21(my meal plus drink), we place the $25 gift card. She comes back, hands us back the gift card (no receipt) and tells us ""actually the manager took care of everything, no charge tonight"" (lie #3) .... We were like.. horrible experience but at least we didn't have to pay and we can give them another try since we still had the gift card. My son was craving their pasta so we take him there today, food was good, service was okay. We give the waitress the gift card and credit card. To our ""surprise"", we only had $4 in the gift card. On our way out I decided to ask for the manager,  he apologized and stated he never said he would take of the entire check yesterday, only his meal.  And that would have been fine if it wasn't for the waitress lying at the end that made us go back today. They lost a customer but they probably don't care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston-4?start=60,2.36,2.36,2.36,2.184,2.36

I feel generous giving two stars but what ever. We walked in about 7:15 Saturday night to a mostly empty restaurant. Which probably should have been our first clue. We were meeting some friends for dinner who had arrived and were already seated. We quickly found them and took our seats. Our waitress came over and took drink orders in a timely manner but that was the where the good stopped. She came back with drinks and took orders for appetizers but not entrees. Fine she would come Back... Eventually. After a while about 10 minutes maybe two of the three appetizers came out. The other one wasn't even what we ordered so they took it back and tried again. We ordered Nachos, potato skins and our friends had the shrimp roll. The potato skins were the missing item here. The nachos looked good but we're pretty well cold and on mostly stale chips weren't good at all. Finally they brought out our potato skin and they weren't much better. The cheese if you can even call it that was like cheese wiz in a can and the potato part looked quite odd as well. Finally we put in our entree orders after all this time. Waited again for quite sometime and again they got the order wrong. They brought grilled chicken and spinach when we ordered grilled chicken and shrimp. This after waiting for quite a while again for our food which when it came out was again lukewarm at best. They sent the chicken back and made a new one which shockingly took forever. Everyone at the table was finished when it came out. Although I must say when it did it was hot and looked very good. What really killed me was that the manager brought the entree out and apologized for the mix up yet the meal was still on the bill. Just sub par service and underwhelming food to say the least.

Also the waiter was very kind when my friend decided to change her order and delivered her food quickly too. It was a great experience here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston-4,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

39,Annie N.,"Spring, TX",0,10,8.0,2.0,2017-03-08,"Came here for endless apps, and they said that the appetizers for endless apps are taking 35-45 minutes and comes in increments of 4. This used to be my to come for late night dining, but on the day I opt for endless apps (being a very picky preggo) I was very upset when my server told me that. She told me to do the sampler combo which costed a bit more, but if I didn't have to wait that long it would've been fine, but I don't want the potato skins and mozzarella or whatever that it had on there. I just wanted the bbq flat bread, wings, and the potstickers! :( I should've just gone to fudruckers across the street. Service was slow also.... we weren't acknowledged when we sat down... it took a good 5 minutes... this place really has its ups and downs. The only reason I return is because I have had good service here. Food is good, but something is definitely wrong with management or staff training. Anyways... let's hope the next time we come back, they have their game fixed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston-4?start=20,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
15,Oscar F.,"Houston, TX",0,3,2.0,3.0,2017-03-26,The food was really good. I got the black bean and avocado burger and my girlfriend got the sizzling chicken and shrimp. The temperature inside was really cold and we could not stop shaking. The service could be better. My server seemed like he didnt want to be there showing almost no emotion and being boring throughout the whole stay. Service took long to bring our appetizer and food in.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston-4,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8

13,Chris C.,"Frisco, TX",5,16,9.0,1.0,2017-04-27,Service is poor - two hours and we still don't have dinner.  Only one server for a large party.  Manager needs to be engaged.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston-4,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
6,Susanne C.,"Cypress, TX",0,51,48.0,1.0,2017-06-03,Freaking horrible service today! Waste of time and money.  Their food has went to crap too.  I'm writing this place off for good.  Never again will I try this chain. So sick of the corner cutting.  Sesame chicken appetizer was old hard cold and very little for $9.00. Not like they use to serve them.  Yuck.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston-4,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
7,Nesi H.,"Baton Rouge, LA",59,28,57.0,1.0,2017-06-18,"Every time I come here for picking up to go it is like a circus. They are so unorganized. I walked in and was told to pickup at the bar. Then from there to go to the to go area. I get to the to go that has 2 people sitting waiting to a group of three employees carrying on their vulgar conversation. So I asked who's working to go and one of them proceeded to get someone so I'm guessing they were already off. If you're not working, don't stand in front of waiting people carrying on conversations with profanity. Unprofessional. Every time I order to go it is a terrible experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston-4,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
4,Michael D.,"Houston, TX",169,50,50.0,3.0,2017-07-07,"Let me start off by saying I am a Fridays regular just not at this location. I always go for the $3 drinks when they have them and the endless apps. There were a couple of times I've been to the Willowbrook location and I've never had any major problems just a bunch of minor annoyances. Last night me and a friend walked in and I could've sworn we were at a block party! They had a dj bumping all of the Houston hits and it was litty. If you wanted a quiet dinner with out people grinding on each other at the bar and little kids running around... sorry about last night. The environment was a little loud and rowdy, but nothing crazily out of control.  So there were quite a few annoyances last night. It takes a little minute for the bartender to come to serve us but that was totally understandable there were plenty of distractions. So I order my drink and it's made and not bad considering they were out of a specific alcohol and just doubled up on the triple sec. The bartender asks if I want another drink I say sure and then the bartender signals to me to finish my drink... I'm like what? I only have a little left so I do. He then informs me they're out of glassware so he has to reuse the same cup. Idk but that just seems unsanitary to me I would've been fine waiting for a fresh cup. Also it was very weird not being able to finish my drink on my own time. The food always comes out fine maybe takes a little longer than usual. The only thing that saved this place from 1 star was the girl working at service bar! She made my third Long Island and it was made properly! She also was adamant about checking in on us and seeing how we were doing. I would've loved if she was a bartender the whole time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston-4,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
9,Brandy L.,"Houston, TX",1,9,10.0,5.0,2017-08-19,I love their jack Daniels burgers! Customer service is great as well! Kept the drinks filled on a hot day and the food was great.  I Wil be back for sure!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston-4,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
0,Pristine C.,"Galleria/Uptown, Houston, TX",335,244,750.0,4.0,2017-09-10,"The hosts at the front were very friendly and welcoming. Our waiter was very helpful and attentive. When he didn't know about something we asked that he hadn't tasted, he asked a fellow employee if they had and what they thought. I dig it, I like honesty. I'm so glad they offer half/full size portions - I definitely did not want anything large for dinner.  My triple berry smoothie was delicious and refreshing. Once I finished it, I tried eating the strawberries: don't. It was very bitter, but no biggie. My pasta was delicious and the half rack ribs my mom got was very tender and flavorful. I was pretty surprised, and for the price you pay, it's a great deal.  I love that they have an everyday happy hour, I definitely will have to check that out sometime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston-4,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52

The bar area is in complete dismay. Bottles laying all over the bar and the glasses are not clean. Lip prints and hand prints on wine glasses. The staff is not personable and not attentive.

8,Patrick B.,"Houston, TX",0,4,,5.0,2017-12-18,"We walked in there 35 minutes before closing but one of the servers said it's too late after us waiting for 5 minutes to be seated. We asked for to-go food but was denied also. After, one of the servers goes talk to the manager Daniel. Daniel went above and beyond to make us happy as he said ""would never tell customers to leave"". He came out while he was doing end of the day work and seated us himself, very polite as he saw we didn't feel welcome at first. He gave us more portions in our food, did not charge for one drink and just made the whole night 10 times better. I usually don't review, but he did such a good job, I owe him this respect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston-4,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

3,Leneka K.,"Slidell, LA",91,2,,5.0,2017-12-29,My initial reaction to going there was that I didn't want to eat any processed microwaved food. But my experience was beyond my expectations!

1,Oshi K.,"Houston, TX",147,4,1.0,1.0,2018-01-06,"Always come to this location and order the Jack Daniels chicken well done, but tonight the chicken was under. I asked them to make me another order as well as my server, however the manager told them to recook my two under cook pieces that wasn't even sent to the kitchen on my plate but was taken to the back in a carry out box. The waiter assured me I would get two fresh pieces but returned with the same two pieces in a different to go container. I am infuriated by the lack of concern and quality, I will be contacted corporate. The server was pleasant but the manager is obviously not here for customer service, I still had to pay for the nasty Mac and cheese($4$!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston-4,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
