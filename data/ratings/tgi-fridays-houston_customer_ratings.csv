17,Maria W.,"Houston, TX",321,849,3943.0,3.0,2013-11-02,"Last night my dad and I came here to eat. We came here because of the 2 for $10 deal and plus my dad wanted to taste their famous steak.  Overall, my full experience with TGI Friday's isn't as good as it is at Applebees. Just another striving American restaurant. Food is overpriced, but you don't get as much for what you pay for. My dad's steak was small, but the fries were overloaded. My dad was disappointed.  Though,  my dragonfire chicken was so delightful. It had mandarin oranges, pineapple pico de gallo, grilled chicken, and under jasmine rice pilaf. On a side of with vegetable medley-- zucchini squash/yellow squash. SOOOOOOOO, GOOOD! A major paradise in my mouth!  Try not to sit near the end where the kitchen is if sitting in the booths... that area smells like old antique items. It smells so bad kinda like Luby's and Denny's combined together.  The floors are very sticky like at the movies. However, the waitress Jessica seems pretty cool. She introduced my dad into some Apple Cider beer AND he fell in love with it.  But I wouldn't go back, it's not worth it. I could make dragonfire chicken at home and I think, I will.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997
37,Jyreka N.,"Houston, TX",95,40,42.0,3.0,2013-12-14,"Once upon a time there was a great resturant by the name of TGI Friday's... Exactly what I said, ONCE upon a time. I don't usually write reviews unless an establishment has taken a dark turn in path. I went in for a carry out order that I called in 20 minutes prior. The owner said it would take 15, got there to pick it up I waited 15 extra minutes to be waited on & pay. Mind you not my order was just the Jack Daniel Chicken strips which were more like nuggets than strips. HIGHLY UNIMPRESSED. I've worked in fast food and the sit down resturant for also 5 years, if you want to tick people off under quote the time, do NOT under quote me about time.

40,Amanda V.,"Pearland, TX",1,34,1.0,3.0,2014-03-01,"Me and my mom came here tonight for dinner. It had been a while since we had come to a T.G.I Fridays, so we decided to go. At first glance at the parking lot, it looked pretty crowded; granted it was a Saturday. Most places are crowded then anyway, but once I went inside to check the wait time, the place looked to be about... moderately crowded. Like, there were people there, but there were still lots of tables and booths available. Because of that, my mom and I were seated immediately.  The first thing and probably the most important thing wrong about our visit was that, because the place wasn't completely crowded, you would think that the service would be fast, right? Well, for some reason, as soon as we sat down and looked at our menus it took a good while for a waiter to come by to take our drink orders. He did show up eventually, but this wait happened all throughout our whole visit.  My mom and I ordered some drinks: a Mango Lemonade for myself and my mom ordered a Kentucky Lemonade (I believe it was called). The drinks took a while to show up and didn't show up until after we got our appetizer. They were drinks you get at the bar, so I guess that was why, but now let's talk about the meal. Since it was just me and my mom that night, we noticed in the menu that they had a 2 for $15.99 deal or a 2 for $12 deal. Considering we go to Chili's a lot and have used that sort of deal before, we thought it was the same thing here. Unfortunately, that's not the case. As we ordered, I got really confused as to how that deal works out and it turns out that you order TWO appetizers and TWO entrees. Like, an appetizer for each person and then your entree. I don't know, it was confusing and definitely not something I'm used to. Well, we got the Pot-Stickers and the BBQ Chicken Flatbread. Both were okay. The pot stickers tasted a bit better than the flatbread, but that was just me. As far as drinks go, the Mango Lemonade was delicious. It definitely reminded me of a drink I would get if I was vacationing in Cancun. Like a real tropical drink. Anyway, speaking of the drinks.... another thing happened. When our waiter delivered the drinks, he also left behind this... shaker container thing that seemed to have what looked like ice water with a lemon slice in it. Thinking that it might have been just water, my mom and I left it alone until the waiter came back. Once he did, my mom asked what was in that container and he pointed out that it was the liquor for my Mango Lemonade. Ummm... he didn't tell us that when he first brought our drinks. And this was the first time I'd ever ordered it. How were we supposed to know it was the liquor? You didn't tell us. I would have thought that it should have been mixed with the drink to begin with. Whatever. I just did it myself. And it still wasn't bad. I would recommend it, just remember that if they give you that container, to mix the liquor in your glass. Finally, our entrees came out and they too were okay. My mom ordered some Chicken and Shrimp dish and I ordered the Korean Steak Tacos. The steak in mine was really, really good. A good flavor to them, but they had a lot of lettuce in them. I didn't really mind that too much, but I think that would bother someone. It also came with a rice pilaf on the side, but there really wasn't that much flavor to it. My mom had also commented that her shrimp tasted like they cooked the shrimp and just put salsa on top of it. Well, once our check came, here's where that 2 for $15.99 deal messed up really bad. It turns out that they charged us TWICE for that. $15.99 showed up twice on the check and the final total for the bill was about 50 bucks. For just me and my mom. I don't know if that was a huge typo or not, but whatever. We were ready to leave anyway since it took forever for our waiter to come back to us. So we just paid for the check anyway. Yeah, we just wanted to leave already. I guess the main thing is that we didn't think the food was that great to cost that much. It really was overpriced. Regardless if there was a typo on the check. I mean, at least 8 bucks per entree? Ehhhh... for T.G.I. Friday's food? Yeah, that is pretty overpriced. T.G.I. Fridays, I don't know what the deal is with your 2 for whatever deals, but you REALLY need to fix that. The pricing at least.  Well, overall to me, some of the food was alright and something I would go back for but I don't think I would try that 2 for whatever deal again. I would just wanna order something else on the menu and HOPE that the service is better next time. If not, I'm gonna have to cross T.G.I. Fridays off my list.  Well... this location, at least.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston?start=40,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005
43,Juanita U.,"Pearland, TX",0,5,,1.0,2014-04-06,"Went to TGI Fridays last night with my husband, my son and my brother.  They were not at all crowded or busy so we were seated right away, but the table was so tiny we had to move everything to a ""ledge"" that was near our table.  I was wondering how they were going to fit 4 meals on this tiny little table.  Our wait person came and took our drink orders after about a 15 minute wait, we ordered 2 waters a sweet tea and a Dr Pepper, easy right?  Then after about 15 more minutes the 2 waters show up and we were told the tea and soda would be right out. Another 15 minute wait for the other 2 drinks.  At that time we ordered the pick 3 appetizer, it took over 30 minutes for the appetizer to show up, the wait person almost threw the plate at us and took off and it was was not what we ordered.  About 15 more minutes our order was taken and we said our appetizer was not what we ordered.  We were told a new appetizer would be brought out.  Our meals finally came after about 45 minutes(still no appetizer) and the extra well done hamburger I ordered was rare, as was my sons.  I specifically said extra super well done and I don't care if it is burned.  My husbands chicken was under cooked and my brothers cajun pasta had shrimp like rubber.  Our wait person never did bring the other appetizer that was supposed to be fixed right.  After about 30 minutes the wait person came to check on us and at that time we reminded her about the appetizer, told her about the undercooked food and we all needed drink refills.  The wait person said she would make sure we got refills and would let the kitchen know about our orders.  30 minutes later we were brought a bill.  No refills, no fixed appetizer and almost raw food still sitting on our plates.  We asked for a manager but we were told the manager was not available at that time. I wanted to slap down money for the drinks and leave, but not wanting to go to jail, we paid the 75.00 bill and left.  We also left all the food on the table(except the appetizer we never got) along with a note, which I am sure went unread and into the trash. The really sad part is, the restaurant was not at all busy and it looked like there was plenty of staff, so I don't understand the poor service. I could not see into the kitchen to tell if it was understaffed, but sending out undercooked meat could have made us really sick and no one really seemed to care. And we paid 75.00 for this and no available manager? What a joke.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston?start=40,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003

I give one star because of the endless app promo, beware they will not let you mix the apps you are receiving for $10. Now what harm is it if you do this?  Friday's says you can order this this and this for one price so if I am ordering something that they have stipulated that costs the same on their menu then let me mix my apps. We are also stripes members and they would not let my wife use her free dessert coupon for her bday because her app meal which was her entree was not an entree in their eyes. Now the wings I ordered first were not fresh. They were warm and not hot the celery and ranch were not refrigerated and the celery was old and dried out.

48,B. L.,"Houston, TX",7,28,19.0,1.0,2014-10-17,"Went here recently with my boyfriend on a Thursday evening. Hostess sat us at a table that hadn't been wiped down. We waited over 5 minutes for a server who looked like he hated his life and his job. When he finally made it to the table we let him know the table was dirty and he stormed off (he probably could've taken our drink order at that moment). It seemed he didn't have any help aka bussers but that is no excuse for his poor attitude. Decided to move to the bar because we didn't want to be there waiting all night. Bartenders greeted us promptly but they were out of my boyfriend's beer selection and served me a 22oz draft without giving me the option of a pint. They claimed it was a better deal (I wasn't there drinking for quantity or I would have been ordering shots). Gouging your guests is not always the best route, people like options. Anyways, after the quick greet, service disappeared and we had to ask to order food from the bartender leaning on the bar doing absolutely nothing. She was not nice, nor mean, just a cold person. It's one thing to have to ask, but usually one would expect to be asked if they were interested in food, especially when it clearly was slow enough to lean. The food was the highlight of the night, it came correct with decent speed, at least the bartender taking our order was not a complete idiot when she didn't write it down. I wouldn't call it the best or freshest burgers in town but it was tasty, hence the one star. Lastly, my boyfriend finished his beer, they failed to ask him if they would like another, which is not only polite but pushes revenue from their standpoint. We waited and waited but we were never asked if we wanted dessert or the check or even another drink. One of the bartenders was at least friendly, her name was Timika, I think. Overall, the bartenders need to be aware of their guests needs and be more attentive and welcoming. They never made eye contact with us during our time spent to simply observe how we were doing or check if we were ok. A verbal check was not even necessary. We finally managed to get someone's attention for the bill and we had already placed a credit card on the bar for almost 5 minutes. Sad for this establishment because we will be moving into the neighborhood and will never come here again. I am a food and beverage manager and know world class hospitality and what to expect from a corporate restaurant or franchise. This place failed in every category. My boyfriend and I easily can tip 30% or more for those deserving, but we will have to look elsewhere to find our ""local spot"" to grab dinner. I've had better service at a Taco Bell or McDonald's. Management, get your restaurant in order and hire some competent, FRIENDLY staff--there are too many other choices around you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston?start=40,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956

The girl bartender was really good. The guy bartender is the one that needed a fix midshift. I went on a tuesday night. The bar patron that was selling coke obviously had been doing this for some time at that location because the bartender knew his exact drink when he walked up. The bar patron proceeded to pull out his phone and blare his preference of music on his cool phone speaker. No one dared told him to turn it down.

8,John V.,"Houston, TX",0,19,12.0,3.0,2016-03-30,It's been a long time since I have been to TGIF but nothing  much has changed. The food has not changed and the small fly's are still around the tables. The bad thing about today was one landed on my appetizer plate and didn't move. It also smell like stall old food under the table on the top level. I would have hope that they would have Improved them selfs after so many years in business.

10,Michelle T.,"Humble, TX",88,1,1.0,3.0,2016-03-31,"Atmosphere: chill (literally and figuratively) Music: bumpin Food: delicious (for the most part) Service: lacking When you walk into a restaurant, the first face you see should be a welcoming smile, with excitement that you chose their place of business to dine in. Instead we got a despondent, annoyed face. No smiles. No welcoming. And she had no idea what tables were open, even though there's a dry erase table chart and server rotation chart right in front of her that if she uses, she could instantly know where to seat us. Our waitress, Whitney, was pretty good. I could tell she was a little busy, with the upstairs all to herself (7 tables and a big top all at once) but she stayed on her game for the most part. My only complaint is disorganization. Make sure the tables have small plates if they're sharing an app. Make sure they have extra napkins if they order ribs or a burger. Bring a refill out when the glass is less than half empty. Bring what your customer wants before they know they want it. It's seriously the little things that can make or break a guest's experience. We'll be back to try it again. -a fellow industry girl.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36

14,Daniel L.,"Houston, TX",79,2,,5.0,2016-06-18,I ordered a certain dish and the server brought me the wrong order. I politely explained to him that it was the wrong order and it was perfectly fine. I was happy with it anyways. But he insisted he'd fixed it and he would take it off the ticket. After a bit he came out with the correct order and made both of the meals complimentary. The manager even came out to apologize for the small mix up and was extremely nice. The service was above and beyond what I expected!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

Drinks are over priced, and when husband asked if they carried a certain scotch at the bar, waitress sounded confused and just replied with a short ""no, we don't have that."" Husband later went to the bar and asked again, bartender answered yes, found our waitress and informed her on what to ask for. Wouldn't have been so bad if the waitress had said, ""I'm not sure about that, let me check for you."" The trip was definitely not worth the $85.00 we spent for just the two of us here.

The other bartender was touching her feet and pulling up her socks, never washed her hands either!!!!! Gross!!!! Probably won't go back! The place smelled musty and moldy.

6,April H.,"Seattle, WA",18,8,2.0,2.0,2016-09-28,"The only reason they get 2 stars is because they had a selection of alcohol..we sat in the bar thinking we would get faster service, mind you there were not many people in the restaurant. We arrived at 935pm stilll no food at 1040pm. I had to keep going to the bar for refills, sharing my space with gnats swarming all around the bar rail. Ugh...the manager came over when i started voicing my opinion on lack of service. That was a joke, ioke he seemed pre occupied with other guests and stories of his xmas dinner he cooked.

She has great potential for anything that faces her.  My meal was prepared perfectly, but my wife's meal was cooked improperly. The manager was there immediately and took care of the issue perfectly He made no excuses and was very courtious  and offered to comp my wife's meal. .  As I said, we are truly pleased at our dining experience.  5 star experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

I mainly come for the daily drink specials, which range from $3-$5 from 11:00am-2:00am ! However, i just encountered the worst experience at this location. I sat at the bar, as I do twice a week here, and a familiar sever named JESSICA that I've seen on maybe one or two weekend visits , approached me. I promptly ordered a Long Island , to which she replied ""you came here last week and didn't pay your ticket!"" Yes I did visit last week, but I paid my ticket and had proof . And she also, was NOT my server previously. I demanded the manager who said the waiter was wrong to assume that I was whomever she was looking for that didn't pay. The manager was very polite and understanding. But I won't be returning. Thank u JESSICA",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

But had a very good experience. after a long day of shopping and waiting at md Anderson I relaxed and ate some spinach and queso dip with salsa as an appetizer With steak,ribs,and shrimp as a main course. The steak was glazed with a great Parmesan butter and the ribs were glazed with a sweet jack daniels sauce. the shrimp was fried and had great flavor. The service was overall good and fast. Very family friendly place. There was people smoking in the bar area and you couldn't smell it where we were sitting at.
