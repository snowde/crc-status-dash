55,Michael P.,"Porter, TX",254,4,,1.0,2012-08-04,"Went to Fridays last night. We were seated quickly. We ordered a Strawberry Fields Salad which my wife and I were going to split, so they did it for us, we were brought large plates and 4 bites of salad each, the portion was so small it looked pitiful on that plate, then came our Entree, Shrimp & Chicken Cajun Pasta, another split, this time into two small bowls, my bowl had less pasta, chicken and shrimp and a lot of sauce, my wife's bowl had lots of pasta, shrimp and chicken, and much less sauce. My wife and i have both have eaten each of these meals before at and the single servings were both much larger than the split servings. The wait person was slow, we waited for a togo cup which never came so we left. On the way home both of us were thinking about the salad each of us had down the street at Cheddars where we both left full, for about the same exact price.  I left Fridays very hungry, came home ate a bowl of cereal and a carrot.

I highly recommend bringing a sweater with you.  The waitress we had was nice. She quickly took our order and the food was out in no time. I ordered the sizzling chicken and loaded mashed potatoes. When the food was brought out it had a big portion of chicken with sautéed onions, red pepper, green pepper, and smothered in cheese. It wasn't the best I've had. There was no real flavor what so ever. I was not impressed. The loaded mash potatoes were ok. Again, not the best. The cheese that was on top seemed burnt (gross!)

The burgers are no bueno.. kind of taste as though they were the pre packaged kind you buy from grocery store and throw on the grill. I asked for mine to be med-well and was advised they all come like that but when mine came it was clearly well done. They do have great appetizers or at least on this visit they were. The only thing that really stood out to me is the Parmesan Garlic Fries, they were REALLY GOOD..  Downside - Ribs were dry and meatless, burgers tastes like they came pre cooked Upside - Service was great, appetizers were great, the Black Bean burger was better than the actual beef burgers..  All in all, it was filling and not the worse I've ever had but I will not be running back to TGI Fridays. If its there and convenient I may stop in but idk .. i mean in the last 5 years this is my 2nd time stopping so that's saying something.  With that being said it's nothing I am running back to however, I don't avoid it like the plague.. they have some other choice foods that I know are pretty decent..

35,Leena C.,"Houston, TX",152,385,129.0,1.0,2014-06-30,"I'm starting to hate this place.  This has always been our Girls' Only lunch spot. We come to get together and for birthdays but I'm starting to rather go to McDonald's instead..... We came in with a party of 7 and ordered. The waittress was awesome and nice but when our entrees came out - my chicken wasn't cooked through - gross. I sent it back and all they did was heat it up and bring it back - WTH!  We had one experience similar to this when Mom ordered a dish without onions and they brought it out with extra onions. She is allergic and couldn't stand the taste/smell (she was on chemo meds and was already having issues with eating) so we reminded the waittress (Mom did order it without onions). The waittress apologized and said she had no idea why they did that and took it back. They scraped the onions off and brought it back. NO! Even the supervisor came over and tried to say that it was a new plate - not true, Mom was going to force herself to eat it and had started to cut it and the ""new"" plate had the same cuts (coincidentally).  We paid and left upset. I contacted their regional office and explained to them the situation and that I felt the supervisor was rude and inappropriate for LYING to our faces. The regional manager told us that anytime anything is sent back to the kitchen they are suppose to throw it out and make a new one and that they would talk to the staff there....well no one listened because all they did with my chicken was heat it up and bring it back. And it still wasn't cooked.  I sucked in my anger because we were there for my niece's birthday. Thankfully we ordered a lot of appetizers and that filled me out because I did not eat my food. I didn't want to chance it by sending it back again. How hard is it to cook chicken?? I really am opposed to going back...after the situation with my Mom, I boycotted that location for months and it looks like I'll be doing it again....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-humble?start=20,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212

I made my way to this particular TGI Fridays, and the staff was prompt and explained the rules of the all you can eat experience.  If you order the wings, you can get a new flavor every time you order a new batch.  Of course they don't want you sharing, nor do they want you to have a to-go plate...understood and accepted.   All in all, the taste that you are given with the wings are just about average.  The wings come out about 10 at a time, and the server makes sure that they get to you slowly in order to let your food settle.  I ordered the traditional flavor and knocked them out in no time.  I ate some of my friend's pot stickers while they took their time getting my Memphis BBQ wings.  Knocked those down and they made me wait to get my garlic parmesan wings.  The garlic parmesan wings are a trap.  They are delicious hot...but when they start to cool...and that butter starts to thicken...my word...they clog up everything and just steal space! Normally a chain restaurant would get 3 stars from me, but this place deserves 2 stars only.  What did they do to get only 2 stars?  They committed a food crime against a fat man...that's what they did.  The server neglected to mention that you could cycle through all the appetizers for only $2 more.  That's right...for $12, you can have your choice of all the appetizers as much as you want. How can this guy do such a heartless thing?  Not mentioning that is a sin.  That is downright dishonest!  For that, your 2 stars shall be your scarlet letter!  I will give you credit that the strawberry lemonade was tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-humble,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.6320000000000006,2.76

The food is always good and the service is friendly and helpful, BUT the place is such a bad need of updating it's pitiful. There is a smell and wallpaper falling, furniture scratched, booth seats torn and you feel the springs. Just so run downed. I asked the waitress if corporate was ever going to update the place and she said when she started a year ago she was told they were remodeling soon. She said she has heard this numerous times in her year of employment. Don't hold your breath in other words!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-humble,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

11,Cierra K.,"China, TX",10,2,,1.0,2017-03-21,"I have never felt the need to write a Yelp review until now. That is how bad this was. To start, my fiance and i walked in and requested a table for two. The ditzy hostess says ok it will be about 15 minutes and we will call you when your table is ready. I HAD TO REMIND HER TO WRITE US DOWN. Second thing: while we waited for a table to open up, we saw at least three open and clean tables available to sit at. Mind you, there were many people waiting to be seated, not just us.  Third thing: We went over to check if a table was ready after about 10 minutes, and the hostess says she had called our names but we didnt come. WE WERE SITTING 6 FEET AWAY AT THE BAR. SHE NEVER CALLED FOR US. WE WERE STARING AT HER.  (On a side note, while were sitting at the bar we noticed right in front of us on the bar a receipt someone had signed that had their personal info it and it sat there in front of us the entire time. The bartender passed it, cleaned around the area, and did nothing.) Fourth thing: They seated us by the restroom. Not near the restroom, but literally outside the door to the restroom. While walking to this table, we passed two perfectly good tables.  Fifth thing: The food was terrible. I can forgive everything if my food is decent, but to be completely honest IT WAS THE WORST STEAK I HAVE EVER HAD. It was 80% grizzle and stringy snappy ligaments(?) or something. I can only imagine that this is what cooked roadkill tastes like. By the way it was the $20 NEW YORK STRIP. We had the meatballs for an app and they were vomit inducing. They were clearly previously frozen and had been microwaved, and the texture was not meat-like, but rather fluffy and soft like they had already been chewed and then mushed into a ball.  Sixth thing: This is just something I find tacky and maybe its a personal preference but the waitress kept picking up our plates while saying ""you wanna grab your fork?"" I just think that its gross and tacky to not just bring your table another fork. Like, its not coming out of your paycheck, you know? Just bring another fork. Dont make me take my dirty fork off the plate your bussing and clean it with my napkin. Im not eating at your mammas house. Im paying good money here. I would rather have skipped dinner altogether than eaten here. NEVER AGAIN!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-humble,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
4,Art D.,"Houston, TX",108,259,118.0,4.0,2017-04-11,"It has been years since I have been to a TGI Fridays. Overall not bad. I visited about 8 on a Friday night and the parking was not too bad. I was meeting a group of people there so did not have to wait for a table because they arrived first. In total there were 5 of us. We had a sampler appetizer, ribs, shrimp, etc. I was not too bad. I had the salmon and spinach with a side of grilled shrimp. My meal was very good and not overly tasty but sufficient for Fridays. It appeared that the other meals were good as well given there were no left overs. We had about two cocktails each. The service was very good. Our waiter was friendly and responsive to the table. With tip the bill was right over $200, not too bad for 5 people, appetizer and beverages. Now for the eye candy. Well if you like large people (lbs) then this is the place for you! Not to insult anyone I will let my comment rest there. I recommend visiting and I recommend parking away from cars because when I came out I had a scratch on my car from what looked like another car trying to park.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-humble,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002

15,Katherine C.,"Kingwood, TX",2,10,10.0,2.0,2017-07-22,I will give this 2 stars because our server Ron is very good when he's at the table. We have been waiting 45min to get out check and get out of here. Our App didn't come out they way it should have so we had to wait about 20min for the rest of it which was fine we didn't mind. But then the girls food came out. Ugh the mac and cheese that they have to throw on the microwave was disgusting! How do you burn mac and cheese?!!!! So we had it returned and made fresh. It came out and we thought it was good but we where wrong. Still burnt on the bottom. Whatever moving on. My fiancé order another beer that took another 15min mind you we where sitting next to the bar. One of my daughters ordered another drink and I had to remind him after being gone and chatting in the bar with he's buddies. Not the best service we've had here. But to be honest they need to fix that kitchen. And just to say I have been in the industry for over 15 years and was very surprised when the manger didn't even stop by to check or talk to us. Horrible. Not a good day today.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-humble,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
8,Marvelous M.,"Houston, TX",19,6,,1.0,2017-08-12,"Horrible service, We ordered drinks (strawberry lemonade) and they were very watered down. Rachel was our waitress, she has no customer service skills. When she finally returned to the table she took our order, i ordered the ""The Famous Ribs"" which was the ribs & wings. We all received our food, my friend ordered ribs and onion rings. They only gave her the ribs and the person that gave us our food, stated the onion rings would be ready soon. The ribs and wings were over cooked especially the wings. Everyone at the table had completed their meal and my friend still hadn't received her onion rings. We told Rachel that our friend never received her onion rings,  so off she goes to get the onion rings, meanwhile, we noticed people around us eating onion rings and they were seated after us, so she clearly dropped the ball on this one. So, my friend was forced to wait for onion rings and to receive them after she had finished eating her ribs, is unacceptable. No apology or explanation for such sloppiness was given. Poor poor poor service. The waitress was slow and she lacked  personality. I would not recommend this location to anyone, they don't seem to have it together at this location in Humble.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-humble,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
1,Michael D.,"Houston, TX",169,50,50.0,3.0,2017-08-22,"After work I wanted to stop by and grab a couple martinis with a friend. Y'all know this is the usual spot especially when the martinis are $3! For that reason I had 4. They tasted great I had appletinis and I also had the $5 jack daniel sliders and they were great too. The only problem was when we first arrived we were greeted and our drink order was taken but after the drinks came out I finished it before our food order was taken. And there was not enough people in there to be weeded. I've been coming for a while and I get great service sometimes, but i guess every restaurant has their moments. I got to try the nachos and the quesadillas which are new on the endless appetizer menu and they are definitely a great addition.

The food is good as well. I recently found out you can only use one stripe account number for each table which is pointless. So in order to get your points you have to eat by yourself.... Why can't we use our own stripe # when we're paying for our own food. I really didn't like that but whatever.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-humble,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
