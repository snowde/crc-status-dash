20,Kiara E.,"Huntsville, AL",1,10,3.0,2.0,2012-10-11,"I keep going to this place hoping that it gets better. Im always a sucker for its commercials. Went there tonight and saw alot of improvement, but still ended up leaving with a bad taste in my mouth... literally. Our waitress was super nice for a change, and i was very excited to try out some new dishes on the menu. The queso dip and bbq flatbread appetizers were delicious though luke warm. I ordered the garlic shrimp. The first few bites were fantastic until i came upon my first WHOLE clove of garlic! The taste was sooo strong and it wasnt even fully cooked. Then when i looked closer at my plate i realized it was full of half cooked garlic cloves. I spent quite a while picking them all out of my plate. Even though i picked out the big pieces i obviously missed alot of small pieces. Im still sick from eating a half a plate full of raw garlic. I couldnt even finish. I will probably be back as soon as i see another promotional commercial and pray it gets better...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntsville?start=20,,,,,
16,J T.,"Huntsville, AL",1,102,201.0,4.0,2013-01-31,Came in and had some French onion soup a salad and the three for all.  Everything was prepared well. I noticed the manager in duty going as far as to take orders in her free time. That is rare to see. Good Job Guys. Yes it's a franchise but not beyond review. ;-),https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntsville,,,,,
8,Pamela M.,"Huntsville, AL",91,301,683.0,2.0,2013-04-10,"I would rate this as a 1 star experience, but, because our server was good, I give T.G.I. Friday's 2 stars. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ My Girls Night Out group converged here last month, and it was my first visit to this T.G.I. Friday's in over 7 years. This store opened back around 1982 and honestly, the ""look and feel"" of it has not changed since then - only thing noticeably absent on the servers were the plethora of buttons they used to have to wear; the hats; suspenders, and the men's neckties.  We were told that to get happy hour prices on apps and drinks, you must sit in the elevated bar area. So, we did. The highlight of our experience was the enthusiasm and conscientious nature of our server. She was really sweet and ""on the spot."" Our group had the following: House Pinot Grigio ($3/glass on Happy Hour and it wasn't bad); (again, the Apps were discounted at Happy Hour); Pan-Seared Pot Stickers App; Loaded Potato Skins App; Spinach Florentine Flatbread App. I noticed T.G.I. Friday's has upgraded their plating since 1982. The food came out on white, elongated dishes and looked good. That is where the goodness stopped.  The Pan-Seared Pot Stickers App was ""mine"" and as much as I love this dish, elsewhere, this was the absolute worst excuse for pot stickers ever. They were chewy dough-wads, cold to the touch, with maybe a 1/4 teaspoon of pork in each one. I managed to pry the dough away from the pork and eat the microscopic pork pieces.  My group didn't complain about their food, even though it arrived rather staggered with several of us sitting ""plateless,"" while others began eating. I think the $3 wine must have kicked in. So, if you want super cheap drinks, go to TGIF during happy hour (4-6? I'm not sure, call to get a definitive time). Eat beforehand at the Krystal around the corner, their food is better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntsville,,,,,
18,Erica E.,"Harvest, AL",0,5,3.0,5.0,2013-04-17,"If you want a real bartender not one of those little chicks who have no idea of kind of drinks are out there. Then you need to go to Fridays they always take care of me and all of my friends. I can walk up to the bartender, and I can tell him I had a bad day make the drink cheap but good and a little sweet. Then bam in a matter of minutes I have a drink in that exceeds my expectations! I love the food half priced appetizers and  great drink deals. I love love love the bbq chicken flat bread! Oh and don't forget about the pan fired pot stickers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntsville,,,,,
15,Dave B.,"Fayetteville, TN",0,2,,3.0,2014-07-08,"Not really impressed. Pecan Crusted Chicken Salad meat was fairly dry. Server was extremely friendly but apparently overworked. Long wait times after meal was delivered, for anything extra. This was on a Monday evening and the store was not extremely busy either.  Would I go back? Probably not",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntsville,,,,,
4,Brennan P.,"Madison, AL",19,76,40.0,2.0,2014-07-12,"This would've been a 1-star review but I did 2 because the food was great and the waitress was very nice. When we got there, it was insanely busy, but it was Friday night, I get it.  When we finally got a table, we were told we would be sitting at a high table, but then we were stopped in the middle of the busy aisle, and were told that someone beat us to the high table, so we got seated at a regular table. But there was a problem with our table: it was too close to the aisle. I sat closest to the aisle so every time someone walked by, I was worried they'd bump into me. Then we got drinks. The first drink I ordered was a Sprite. At first I thought it was the bottom of the tap (just my luck) but I was told that the Sprite was something else, but it was still dreadfully bland, it tasted like water with a hint of I-don't-wanna-know. I got another Sprite, still blech. But then I just asked for a coke, which was decent. Then...you guessed it. Food! I got pasta with marinara sauce on the side with fries. I ordered from the kids' menu. Don't judge me. But it didn't get to our table until like an hour after we got there, well, it was busy when we got there, but even when we did, it wasn't too too busy. We should have gotten our food within 35 minutes. Our table had no food on it for an hour, which pissed me off. We got there at 7:30, and left at 9. And we were gonna go to bridge street in Huntsville but since they kept us waiting, everything was closed when we got there. So TGI Friday's kept us starved for over an hour, and made us late to the mall. Thanks a lot, TGI Friday's! The worst thing is, we have a coupon for August and September also, but I don't have a reason to use anytime soon after the terrible service we've had. We'll give 'em to someone else because we obviously aren't gonna use them. In fact, the only reason we went to TGI Friday's is because I had a coupon, but that was money wasted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntsville,,,,,
13,Melissa D.,"Toney, AL",0,2,5.0,5.0,2014-09-13,Service was great & everyone was friendly.  I got the Bleu cheese burger and it was delicious! Def recommend it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntsville,,,,,
9,Michael L.,"Ardmore, AL",8,103,58.0,1.0,2014-11-29,"I have been here three times since living in Huntsville,  the first time was amazing; food was hot, drinks were spot on, service was perfect and the restaurant  was clean. The second time was just okay, service mainly sucked the server had a chip on his shoulder food was okay. This third and final time, I didn't even eat here. I walked in a smelled what seemed to be like a two day old baby diaper smell, floor were sticky and dirty,  the ledge beside the table had a dead fly and some other debris on it and the vent above my table was caked with dust. It was so bad, my wife asked if we could leave and go somewhere else, so that's exactly what we did.When I asked were the health inspection score was they said it's usually in the front and we don't know where it went. That was way too many red flags for me. So eat at your own risk here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntsville,,,,,
11,Alicia D.,"Owens Cross Roads, AL",0,1,1.0,1.0,2015-09-03,"DISGUSTING! The half a chicken breast on my salad looked like it was cooked for 5 hours, sat out for 3 days, and was slapped on my salad this afternoon.  Not even reheated! YUM! NOT!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntsville,,,,,
12,Penny M.,"Madison, AL",0,8,,1.0,2016-02-11,"Was once very good.  Today I went there for lunch.  The greeter was not the older gentleman is not there anymore.  The current guy was training someone.   Not a nice person at all.  I asked for a booth or a table on the tile floor rather than the wood floor.   Instead he sent me to a table on wood and right next to the mens room.  Then my food took so long that I asked the waiter to check on it and if it was ready i would take it to go, otherwise cancel.   He brought my food which was cold.  it must have been ready a while earlier.  Horrible experience.

14,Stacy N.,"Stafford, VA",0,17,,4.0,2016-04-24,"This was a second choice after choice one totally blew it. The staff was really respectable ad nice. When we walked in we were seated right away, on Friday night, at about 7pm. Our server, Brittany, was awesome. We ordered drinks, which were a little slow in coming out, and food. Dinner was prompt and delicious. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because there was a mix up about what was on happy hour and what wasn't and while Brittany was helpful, she didn't really seem to know all the answers or hear the questions clearly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntsville,,,,,
6,Rich J.,"Castle Rock, CO",0,11,,4.0,2016-05-14,For better or worse You know what to expect at TGI Fridays. The food was good and the service was very good. Will come back when in the area and I recommend it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntsville,,,,,
7,Kesli B.,"Huntsville, AL",0,30,11.0,2.0,2016-10-14,"Okay, so I hate writing unhappy reviews, especially because I am so easy to please. And this one was extremely disappointing, because when we first got there, the experience seemed so promising. Our waitress was friendly and polite, very tentative at first, but slowly declined. Our appetizers were amazing (the platter: wings, spinach and artichoke dip, and pot stickers). But the main course was not as appetizing.... The Bruschetta Chicken Pasta my mother and I both ordered was not angel haired noodles, like the menu described, our waitress rarely appeared after we received our meal, AND the very rude/obnoxious three young men the waitress sat directly behind us, were nauseating. My sister wanted a box for the remaining portions of her meal, my mother and I did NOT even though over 80 percent of our food was still there, because it was so distasteful. The waitress dropped off our check without asking if we wanted boxes, dessert, or refills. Very disappointed, especially when the young men made nasty/unwanted comments as we got up to leave the restaurant. There was not a single manager we saw throughout the entire meal. Definitely will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntsville,,,,,
3,Kayoko C.,"Huntsville, AL",3,2,,2.0,2016-10-16,"I ordered at the bar on 10/14/16. I had the parmesean crusted chicken.  It was overcooked as it has been the last few times I ordered it. I had two drinks (decent) and ordered a takeout meal for my son. This is where the biggest disappointment happened. I bring home the 1/2 slab of rib meal to my teen and when he opens it. This 1/2 slab contained maybe 3 ribs. The meat was  no bigger than my hand. A water bottle was larger than this 1/2 slab of ribs. Needless to say he was still hungry after eating it. I live too far to return the meal but wont order it again. Also, wont return to TGIFs for a while. This is probably the reason it was empty on a Friday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntsville,,,,,
1,Ginger W.,"Hazel Green, AL",0,18,,4.0,2017-01-30,"We ordered at the bar and had the jack daniels ribs.  They were amazing and oh so very tender with no fat at all!!  The salad and fries were very good too!

10,Lesh R.,"Madison, AL",0,11,,1.0,2017-02-06,"It's super bowl Sunday and I go to TGI FRIDAYS my favorite spit for their wings. I call ahead to place my order which was only 24 wings fried extra extra extra hard. I get there, proceeded to the bar to pick up my order and even i get up there the young lady takes my order to the back, and when she brought it back out I asked her off it was incorrect the first time she said no that it had been sitting there and she had them make some fresh ones. I check my order and they where so soft and baby could have eaten them so I told her that they were soft and I asked for extra extra extra hard. She takes the bag and asked if I wanted those dropped again, I said no because they will burn since they already have sauce on them. And she said ok and took the order and placed it to the side told the cooks that I wanted them fried extra extra extra hard. I then see her come back up to the front and gran my old order. I said to myself I bet they are going to drop these wings that already have sauce on it and they will clearly smell and look burnt. Within 1 minute she returns with the same bag, I checked and sure enough they were dropped in the hot grease with the sauce on them and they smelled and we're clearly burnt. She asked if they were ok and I said no ma'am they are burnt. She calls for the manager or someone and I said don't even worry about it because I have ordered my wings like this everytime that I come to dine in or carryout and it's always correct. I only had one problem before when the cook tried to pull this same trick with dropping the already sauced wings in the oil again and excised me to pay for and eat it. The last manager years ago corrected the situation when I called to the store because I didn't check my order before I left the last time. But I will clearly rethink about visiting again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntsville,,,,,
2,Donna B.,"Meridianville, AL",23,1,,1.0,2017-03-13,"This was mine and my daughters favorite place to meet and eat on Fridays, We loved the Jack Daniel flat iron steaks . We always had fun and it was  always so good. After my visit today I will no longer be going back. I had a coupon with buy one lunch dinner and get one free so our whole family decide to eat lunch there. I didn't know we had to order only the choose of two items that was on the menu. So that was frustrating. We when for lunch at 1215 to eat we didn't received our lunch till after 2 o'clock. Then I ordered a med cooked steak they cooked it exwill done, it was trouble the broccoli was still cold from half steaming I'm guessing! !They afford  cook it again but by then I was to hurgery to wait another 2 hours. The waitress explain to us she was sorry that she was the only waitress for the whole place and one cook.Which made me feel bad to ask her for anything at that point. Which is why I went out to start with!! Then when I got the bill I saw I was charged a fee for the person who sat us down and our waitress which made no since to me . So I  pay even more of a tip for our over worked waitress. This lunch date  was very expensive exhausting and nasty!!! Needless to say A great restaurants went down to not wanting to staff it correctly. Caused very poor service all the way around....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntsville,,,,,
