4,Scott H.,"Indianapolis, IN",65,389,2.0,3.0,2013-09-12,"Went there for lunch and I ate at the bar. I was eating a late lunch so the restaurant was pretty empty. The bar area was clean and there was a cool TV layout for sports fans. I ordered a cheeseburger and cheese fries, but they forgot the cheese fries order. The bartender was great. He went to the kitchen and quickly brought out fresh cheese fries. The food was pretty good. Not bad, but not fantastic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-2,,,,,
5,Yessie B.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,1,,1.0,2013-11-16,First time I came here I both I and my husband got sick. We decided to give it another chance last night and service was poor we got to order at 10:04 we didn't get our food till 10:59 I know well done steak takes a while to cook but not an hour!! And still ended up paying$61&some change never again!! Pissed us off to see all waiters host whatever there called sitting down on chairs by the restrooms. Not professional! If they have no tables help clean or something!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-2,,,,,
2,Kevin D.,"Indianapolis, IN",6,29,1.0,2.0,2013-12-13,For a restaurant in the mall this isn't bad. Meal was affordable and the food came fast. Good beer specials ever on a Friday night! Lajoya is a good waitress too! Update!  Later last night once we were home my wife started feeling nauseous. She ended up vomiting twice last night. She is almost back to 100% so it's pretty obvious this is most likely a case of food poisoning. Bummer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-2,,,,,
3,Jennifer S.,"Indianapolis, IN",470,359,3014.0,2.0,2014-02-12,"I generally avoid chain restaurants, but with a teenage daughter who insists on an occasional trip to the mall, I find myself here every so often for a beer while I wait.  Don't go hungry, the foods not good. Better to find a healthy option in the food court. The inside is small and kind of crowded (with a family), though the bar area is a little bit better.  Service is just okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-2,,,,,
1,Margaret V.,"Canton, MI",286,1088,186.0,3.0,2014-05-26,"It's a Fridays and it's a place to get a hearty meal and a drink after shopping!  My husband and I usually stop here and get a drink or snack while in town for the Indy 500.  It's a little smaller than a regular friedyas, but they have the same menu and promotions as others.  So far, the staff has been nice!  We will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-2,,,,,
