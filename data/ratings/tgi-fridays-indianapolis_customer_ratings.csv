17,Theresa K.,"Indianapolis, IN",264,207,44.0,3.0,2012-01-11,"Eh. This was okay. The food sounded much better on the menu than it really was. I had a chicken pasta dish, and while the chicken was pretty flavorful, the pasta was not at all. And it should have been because it had tomato, basil, etc in it.  The restrooms were pretty messy- paper towels all over the wet, somewhat muddy floor. When I stepped into a stall without paper towel in front of it (for you know, risk of walking out of it and being THAT girl), the lock on the door was broken, and there was a huge hole in the door. And it smelled like sour milk. Gross.  The rest was pretty mediocre. The prices were pretty decent for what it was.

3,Diana H.,"Whitestown, IN",2,31,120.0,2.0,2015-03-02,"TGI Fridays was offering its promotion of all-you-can-eat appetizers. Apps are limited to a select list, they are $12 per person, and you can select from any of the approved apps for your refills. Ex. Order the Pan-Fried Potstickers, and for Round 2, order Mozzarella Sticks, or Boneless Buffalo Wings, etc. You cannot take home any unconsumed food. Unless you are a linebacker and can eat unreal amounts of food, this promotion is NOT WORTH IT. My husband saw the commercial on TV, but they of course didn't mention the price. At least they were quick with bringing out dishes and would take our order for the next round when serving the current round. My recommendation is to STAY AWAY FROM THE POTATO SKINS!!! My husband and daughter both had them. My husband soldiered on, but we returned our daughter's order. They were SUPER OILY! The waitress was very nice about it, and gladly got our daughter another selection. When we told her the potato skins were very oily, we asked if they had been deep fried, which was the only possible explanation for the level of oil. They had been deep fried! Who on earth deep fried potato skins? DISGUSTING! We did enjoy both the boneless buffalo and honey BBQ wings, pan-fried potstickers, and mozzarella sticks. Though, the m.s. weren't hot enough, were too strongly flavored with garlic, and had too little marinara dipping sauce. Sauce issue was the same for all dishes. Had to ask for more each time. SERVICE WAS OUTSTANDING! Ambience was fine except for a few loud crews. There was a grown man at a table with his family, and instead of spending time with his family, he was playing a very loud video game. Really? Grow up and get some manners! But, that wasn't the restaurant's fault, just poor manners. Women's restroom sink area was a mess.

Remains a top contender of restaurants to always go to because the service and food are always great. 2.  Becomes plagued as a restaurant where you only have fond memories of how good they used to be.   TGI Fridays seems to be falling into #2.   The food is ok, not spectacular even through they try to keep innovation alive with new food/drink items, but execution for some reason seems to flop instead of having customers flip.   Even their signature Jack Daniels burger Is not that flavorful juicy slathered goodness that was its claim to fame.   I tried the Smoke Stacked Burger and based on the photo one can see it's an ok burger.  Taste rating = 5.  Fries were a bit limp as if they had been sitting as our server tried to get my party of 5 their food out at once.  My friend was not wowed by the sweet potato fries.   I pretty much have categorized TGI Fridays as a place for budget friendly drinks (not just the bottom is the barrel well drinks) and decent pub food to enjoy while drinking or checking out a sporting event; not a good restaurant with awesome entrees that also had great drinks and snack food.   I give them 1 star for late hours, 1 for decent drink specials and 1 for the sheer fact they keep trying to bring back the pizzazz that has a one wishing everyday they could say TGIF is the place to be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
1,Mike T.,"Novi, MI",0,24,2.0,1.0,2016-11-21,"Not sure what up is with this particular Fridays??? Apparently it's where you go in town if you want to be depressed. I went because I was in the mood for a burger and had free Fridays points to burn. I told myself I wouldn't go back to any Fridays after my last experience and this only reinforced what I already knew. For a slow Monday night it took the bartender what seemed like five minutes just to acknowledge me...isn't that part of the reason people sit at the bar?? for faster service??? or so I thought. Actually the food came out fairly quickly and I did get refills on my beverage without waiting too long once the bartender said hello. As for the burger, I ordered the Truffle Stacked Burger. Talk about bait-and-switch!!!! It had two of the thinnest burger patties I ever saw, nothing like the picture. Not that the food ever really looks like the pic but c'mon!!! TGI Fridays, what has become of you? If you are in the Fashion Mall at Keystone area and are in the mood for a burger try McDonald's instead, at the very least the service will be quicker!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis?start=20,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

I have dined here many times, but for some reason, this is my first review.  Nevertheless, I ordered the JD Sampler as I usually do, and it arrived in a decent amount of time, but that's pretty much where my service stopped. Like, I never saw my server again.  No one ever stopped to see if my food was ok, or if my drink needed to be refilled.... nothing.  No server came by until I wanted my check.   That was a little disappointing to me since I am a sucker for good customer service.  But on a lighter note, I did enjoy my food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

I was only slightly buzzed. I got my bill and it was only $11 so, it was probably a better buzz for the price than I would get at a regular bar on a Saturday. My non- drinking husband got some app sampler and the food looked like store brand frozen apps baked in the oven. Come to drink. Don't eat and you will have a three star night.

32,Molly A.,"Bloomington, IN",2,33,,4.0,2017-03-12,"i love friday's in general.  it has a great menu & i have definite favorites (cajun shrimp & chicken pasta, pot stickers, nachos, green bean fries, sizzling chicken & cheese, to name a few) & i also worked there in my early 20s. so my boyfriend & i went just yesterday & sat in the bar area.  we enjoyed a couple drinks & i wasn't very hungry so i thought i'd just do soup.  i hadn't tried the french onion (always used to have the broccoli cheddar) so i went for that.  he decided to start with the endless apps for $10 & got a burger/fries to go after. first off, the endless app thing is per person.  i told our waitress i had a stomach issue & was just going to try a bite of what he ordered & she let it slide so i was not charged to share with him (also, when she came by she could tell i was not lying, i had one meatball & one pot sticker). OH MY GOD.  the MEATBALLS.  where the HELL did those come from?!  i wanted to eat 40 of them but i couldn't.  they were incredible & not what i was expecting from a mid-level chain.  pot stickers were also as good as always!  & i actually really liked the french onion soup!  i had some elsewhere a couple months ago & there was SO much bread that i literally had no broth left.  i LOVE soup so i want my actual SOUP, not bread soaked with it.  this one was the perfect ratio. i don't know how more people don't enjoy friday's.  our server was cool, food was great, drinks were what i wanted, walls are always fun to look at...maybe i'm biased haha.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

35,Erica P.,"Indianapolis, IN",129,8,,1.0,2017-05-30,"If there was a way to give a 0 star rating I would. This has to be THE WORST fridays I have ever been to. The first time I went in I was ignored for 20 minutes as I sat in the bar with my girlfriend. The second time we came it was the same experience. Last night we decided we would give it one last try....however, after this we will NEVER return. First off the beers were coming out hot, which was fine. So we ordered a mojito and a frozen peach margarita, because they were on the $3 menu, along with endless apps. The drinks took 30 minutes?!?! And they made the margarita wrong, when it got fixed we kindly thanked our server Ellen. When we FINALLY got our check we noticed the margarita was $8.37!!! The waitress never informed us of the up charge margarita. She then said ""the syrup was extra"" a whole FIVE dollars more?! I work in the bartending industry so I knew this was a blatant lie!! She did not offer to fix it for us nor did she EVER inform us of this additional charge for some peach flavor! This was the last straw and we will never return to this establishment! I advise any new comer to steer away from this absolutely terrible ""restaurant""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
25,Brendan H.,"Indianapolis, IN",63,18,3.0,2.0,2017-06-30,"This is the kind of place you bring your wife during your disappointing marriage. The menu has enough drinks on it to get you both going to the point where you forget that you really should have divorced 15 years ago. The atmosphere is that of a knock off Applebee's with random trash they found at the local Goodwill thrown on the wall.  Their food quality is enough to make children cry. No, seriously. There were at least 6 crying kids in this dumpster of a restaurant. Even Tom Hanks in Castaway would have picked eating tree bark over this food. Their Cajun Pasta less Cajun than a steaming turd sprinkled with Cayenne pepper.  Now they did have some nice chicken tenders. However they had more breading on them than the inside of a Thanksgiving turkey. The service was quality. Our waiter did a superb job of replenishing our water.  So if you and your (should-be-ex) wife are looking for an average evening out, then this is the place for you.

21,Alaina W.,"Washington Township, Indianapolis, IN",11,1,1.0,1.0,2018-01-13,"I hadn't been to a TGI Friday's in awhile, so I was excited to visit. However, I was VERY disappointed with this specific location. The host asked if we preferred dinning or bar seating. I said we would prefer which ever is the fastest. He told us bar was self-seating so we looked around. There were 3 open tables but none of them had been cleared off yet. So we said dinning. We were told it would be a 25 minute wait. In those 25 minutes we kept an eye on the bar tables and they never did get cleaned off/cleared. Once we were seated our waiter brought us our waters and said he would be back with us in a few minutes....... he never returned! We waited another 15-20 minutes before a new female waitress came to our table and asked if we were doing okay. I told her how or waiter never returned to take our order. She laughed and said, ""oh yea, that's Chris, don't worry about him, I'll take care of it"". She took our drink and food orders and everything was fine. While we were waiting for our food to arrive we were absolutely freezing!!! I had on jeans, knee high boots and long sleeves and I was still shivering from the temperature. I'm always one to complain that I'm hot, so this was an odd change for me. The food was decent, not the best. The broccoli was soggy. We had to stop someone and ask for our bill, and even then it took them 15-20 minutes to bring it to us. I will NEVER eat at a TGI Friday's again. Horrible service! Horrible conditions!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
