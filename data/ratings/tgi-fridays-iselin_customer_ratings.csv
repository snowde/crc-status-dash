25,Jason S.,"Southington, CT",162,362,255.0,3.0,2012-03-19,Typical inexpensive chain restaurant. I was down in NJ by myself for business and my waitress was very good. The mango peach lemonade slush was very good and had free refills! I had a the Petite Sirloin topped with Langostino Lobster. It wasn't the greatest but it wasn't terrible neither.

We got seated and told a server would be right with us, and nobody ever came to help us. At one point we made eye contact with a waiter, who COMPLETELY ignored us and still didn't come over to ask if we wanted drinks! We were so upset that we got up and switched sections. After making the switch we had a ""temporary"" server who informed us our waitress was on break. she was nice enough but our food took FOREVER to come out, and on top of that it was cold by the time it reached us.

This looks like a straight up date spot, not to mention that all of the seating area surrounds the bar. I was really impressed by the ambiance they created out of the once family-style chain.  Other than this, the food hasn't changed too much. I've always loved their Jack Daniels menu, which they've expanded, and their drink selection is bigger too. I was obnoxiously picky about this one shrimp dish on their 2 for $20 menu and the waiter and kitchen were really accommodating.  Overall I was happy about my experience here.

Yummy pinot grigio, forgot to ask the bartender what brand it was. He was generally nice. I ordered the wedge salad because I didn't want to get spendy, and it was pretty tasty. Their bleu cheese is lip-smackable, and didn't taste like it was from a bottle. I think the bacon pieces could have been better, and the side of jalepenos I ordered were so bland, I thought I was eating plain sweet peppers. Definitely from a can.  Otherwise, I was satisfied.

The servers are awful: forgetting items ordered, not offering refills, and they give an attitude if you present a coupon. I tip nicely and know to tip on the full price, not the discounted. So I don't appreciate poor service because I showed you I wanted to use one.  The worst of all: undercooked food! I ordered the Korean Steak Tacos which I've ordered at other Friday's and the tortillas were still cold and rubbery. You could barely bite through. Ridiculous. The food in general is over salted in order to make you drink more, but again, they don't ask if you want a refill. Never going back again.

We had a 20% off coupon and figured what the heck.  You needed to show the coupon before ordering which we did,  upon receiving the bill low and behold the 20% ws NOT taken off.   We had french onion soup which came out lukewarm. The glasses and silverware were dirty. Each glass and piece of silverware had pieces of some sort of hard substance on them. I can only imagine what was on the inside of the glasses. The draft beer was skunky, which is ususally caused by not having the lines cleaned out on a schedule. The dinners did not come out at he same time. One was brought to the table 10 minutes after the others. The ribeye steak was tough.

On my most recent trip, I sat at the bar and whole area was inundated with fruit flies!. Talk about being uncomfortable swatting bugs away from your food and drinks. The bartender even scooped a bug out of someones drink with a straw and put a new straw in the drink and gave it to the customer. That was all I had to see at that point. I asked to speak with a manager and he said he was ""too busy"" to come out and speak to me. Way to go customer service!

19,Lenny K.,"Edison, NJ",252,682,369.0,2.0,2014-06-01,"I really enjoy their food, but this TGIF, like all the others I have been to over the years, seems to suffer from lack of quality service.  In fact, my wife will generally refuse to go here because of that.  This time I convinced her because a client gave me a gift card.  Plus I received a coupon in the mail with several offers including either 20% off or a free entrée.   So, we arrive and the hostess tells us it will be about 5 minutes.  I ask if she wants my name and she said not to worry as she can recognize us.  There may have been one other couple waiting.  I'll say yes to that and give them the benefit of the doubt.  We sit and after about 5 minutes, I look up and that hostess is no longer there but all of a sudden a few different groups are coming in and asking for tables.  The ""new"" host came over to us and asks if we were waiting and if so, needs our name.  I told him what happened with the prior hostess and he said nothing.  Now I am wondering if we will ever get seated.  We did get seated shortly thereafter but did I need this extra stress?  Really?   Communication skills people!!! We are seated and given the menus.  There are a lot of drink options and most of them don't have prices.  I don't like that.  I must have sounded like a real cheapskate asking the prices of various drinks.  More to come on this later. Our server was good and so was the food.  I had a Yucatan Chicken Salad and my wife had a Cobb Salad.  We also had the Pretzel and Cheese appetizer.  No complaints at all about the food or the drinks. Time to pay.  I ask for the check and give him the coupon card and also tell him I have a $25 gift card.  No problem with that and he takes free entrée off as it was a bigger discount than the 20%.  Brings the check and stands there waiting for me to pay.  I told him I am not ready to pay and he left.  What was with that?  Was he afraid I had never been to a restaurant before and would screw up the tip because of the discount?  I guess me asking for the drink prices must have scared him into thinking I was a penny pitcher.  I actually left  a generous tip, not so much that I was thrilled with everything, but that the meal didn't cost me much due to the discount and the gift card. The next day I realize he never gave me back my discount card that still had 2 more uses in it for the next 20 days or so.  At first I was annoyed then realized there is no way I am gong back, at least for anytime soon.     If anyone is planning on giving me a gift card, make it for Houlihans or Cheesecake Factory.  I can do without TGI Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-iselin?start=20,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.2800000000000002,2.92

But none of the options were very healthy, Mostly fried and/or cheesy.  The drinks were pretty good. They had some specials going on. I had a firey apple, which is Sumer shandy, fireball and something else maybe. But it was pretty good and only $5.   Some of the people in my group ordered long islands. Apparently they have two kinds, one for 6 and one for 12 which has better liquor. They were charged for the more expensive one because they didn't know there was a difference. They asked the waiter, he explained the situation. They then offered to pay for it, but the waiter changed the price for them without hesitation.

15,Tara D.,"Highland Park, NJ",0,10,2.0,1.0,2016-08-28,"Upon ordering my entree on Sunday, August 28, 2016 with waitress Chris at TGIF 401 Gill Ln, Iselin, NJ 08830, NJ I displayed my 150 strip reward showing the entree that I was ordering. I ordered additional sides and a club soda with lime.  Chris, a female waitress told me that I had to order a drink in order for her to accept my stripes reward. I questioned her statement and asked why? She informed me that her manager told her that strip rewards will not be honored unless customers ordered a drink. I asked Chris to show me that in writing. She responded that her manager told her not to accept them without a drink order. I showed Chris the fine print on my reward stating, ""no minimum purchase required."" Chris responded that she couldn't accept the stripes statement. I told Chris that I felt uncomfortable with her demand but that I planned to order other food.  I finished my dinner, ordered dessert, and coffee and Chris told me that I still needed to order a drink. I informed her that I did not want a drink and asked for a manager. I showed her the stripes reward again stating that a minimum order was not required. Jimmy came over. I asked if he was a manager as he never stated whether he was. He responded, yes. I showed him my stripes reward and explained my concern. He told me that he and Jamie were the managers on duty and that he was not accepting my stripes reward unless I ordered a drink. I asked for the names of the restaurant and General managers, along with the restaurant number.  Jimmy told me that he did not remember. I asked him to show me restaurant disclosure regarding the stripes program indicating the minimum purchase requirement but he could not find one. He insisted that Jammie informed him that I had to purchase a drink.  The Stripes program clearly indicates that members don't have a minimum purchase amount. In addition, I purchased a side of shrimp, dessert, and a coffee and was harassed three times while eating my rib eye meal and then dessert by Chris about purchasing a drink or refusal to accept my stripes reward. Jimmie, assistant manager continued the same.  This location does not honor the corporate rewards program. When I asked Jimmy, he stated that they are not required to do so. Jimmy only accepted my stripes reward after I told him that I was going to contact their corporate offices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-iselin?start=20,2.48,2.48,2.48,1.5080000000000002,2.48

(Is there a Safe Serve Licence in the house?)  The place seemed empty but there  were still several tables that had not been cleaned throughout the entire establishment.  So much that the hostess put an inordanite amount of her thought process trying to detemine where I could be seated.  Then she got a few serversf to buss the table so I could be seated.  Even after cleaning the table there was food debris left on the chair.  A QUESTION WHERE IS THE HEALTH INSPECTOR?  I called the manager at that point and she thanked me for bringing this to her attention.  She promised if I had any further issues to call her again.   Oh that was nice so I decided to stay and try the ""Endless Apps""  Meatballs... I had them before they were ""endless"" so I knew this would be a good choice why were they cold when they came to the table...   anything COULD happen right.  I asked the very nice server to take them back to the kitchen and heat them up....  they came back the SAME TEMPRATURE lol.  Somebody say twilight zone.   Hmmmmmmmmm ok let's try the Boneless Wings ok they were tasty but again lukewarm.  Ok TG one last chance let's try the IMROVED Potato Skins.  Yucco shut the front and call the Ghost of Fridays Past caz theywere not good.   I asked for the check but I'm still not understanding why I had to pay for anything.  I did not enjoy one thing oh wait a minute the cherry limeade thingy was refreshing.

I asked about my wife's, and the food runner snapped back with a prissy attitude, while rolling her eyes. ""Yeah, it's coming."" Don't know why the service here is always so bad and now that the food quality has also gone downhill, I don't know if I'll be back. Plenty of other restaurants in the area to choose from.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-iselin,1.56,1.56,1.56,,1.5600000000000003
62,Jade S.,"Rahway, NJ",0,21,13.0,1.0,2018-01-13,Such slow service. To go and dining in. I placed an order at 5:12pm they told me it'd be ready in 15 minutes. I got there at 5:30 and I'm now leaving at 6pm with my food which wasn't prepared the way I ordered it but I don't even care I refused to wait anymore than the 30 minutes I already waited in the restaurant. I've dined in several times and the service is just as slow but at least when sitting down you have drinks to help you pass the time. I love Fridays food but between this one and the one in linden it's becoming very hard to like the restaurant as a whole. 0 stars.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-iselin,1.52,1.52,1.52,,1.5200000000000002
