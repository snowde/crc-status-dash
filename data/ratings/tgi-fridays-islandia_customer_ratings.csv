This particular Fridays --the Islandia location-- was terrible on virtually all fronts. -The service was lousy: no table settings; approximately 10 minutes for drinks; 15 minutes to get a refill; waitress was nowhere to be found when we needed napkins. -The food was subpar: it took at least 30 minutes to get our food; some (more than half) of the food was just a few degrees above room temperature; the overall quality of the food was below average (by Friday's standards). -The bathroom's were disgusting: other than the fact that the bathroom's looked like they weren't cleaned since the previous night --the bathroom itself was very cold (I guess the heat was broken); there was no hot water to wash hands; there were no paper towels to dry hands. It was just a terrible overall experience. This was around 9pm on a Sunday night. Our waitress was ""nice,"" but other than that she wasn't on top of her game.

Unfortunately, on the Island there are not to many places that serves both past 11pm, especially during the week. Rather than heading into Manhattan after work (which I sometimes do), where there are late-night eateries abound, I'll head here.  The food here is what it is, which is small step above fast-food. The burgers here are better than decent, the sirloin not bad for Fridays. Everything else is pretty meh. Service is pretty spot on for the most part, although from visiting often, I know most of the severs and bartenders on a first name basis which results in some very personalized service and hooked up cocktails.

Overpriced at $16 for a small chicken breast, about 4 slices of zucchini, a little spinach, with a side of tomato salad with two mozzarella balls. The smallest plate of food with over cooked chicken that was way to salty and rubbery was not worth the price.  The only reason this place doesn't get 1 star is the drink specials aren't bad.

First experience involved a Sunday evening. I ordered the jack Daniels sampler and my boyfriend got the traditional sampler. There was hair in my shrimp, completely stuck to the sauce. The waitress asked if I wanted to replace the shrimp, but at this point I lost my appetite and just wanted them to reduce the bill. They didn't offer, no apologies, just asked if I wanted a replacement. Disgusting. Second time, My bf got a job promotion and we wanted to grab a quick app and drink to celebrate on a weeknight. It was a Wednesday evening around 7:30 and when we arrived the hostess disappeared into the kitchen. Another girl was left behind looking completely lost. We asked if we should just grab a seat ourselves and she told us the girl was probably cleaning a table off for us. The girl came back out of the kitchen and proceeded to take us to a large booth in the bar area. There were tons of unoccupied tables in the dining room so she definitely wasn't cleaning a spot for us to sit. I sat down in a booth that was fixed with fridays red and white tape (tacky) and wanted to have a conversation with my bf about the new position. No such luck with that because we were seated under a speaker that was blasting music. I asked our waiter if we could move our seats and he said a dj was coming soon and they would be turning the music off anyway. On a Wednesday? Never happened by the way and we were there for about an hour and 20 mins. I was pissed because we couldn't hear eachother at all and were forced to listen to crappy music. I could see if you're out with some friends laughing and loud and drinking up a storm at the bar, that isn't what we were trying to do...so why were we seated there?

Look forward to another fun evening there with good friends and an Ultimate Margarita!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-islandia,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
3,Marea P.,"Bay Shore, NY",3,11,22.0,5.0,2017-06-17,"5 stars for greeters, server (Michael C.) and management. We were greeted, door was held open for us. The girl reminded me of a friend and I told her so Bc I was staring at her. She indulged me in allowing me to show her a photo of my friend, which was very nice of her. Host and hostess were nice, male seated us and retrieved 1, then a second and finally a 3rd highchair as the other first two had broken straps. With the 3rd a manager came over, very pleasant female with long pretty braids, who was sincerely apologetic and chatted w us briefly, she was kind and helpful.  Server (Michael C.) came right away, brought drinks, my husband got a Mai Tai, which came w a collectible glass he said didn't seem very strong, I didn't try it, but it had the correct accompanying garnishes, which I am big on a drink being properly garnished. He offered appetizers and we put in our kids meal, mac and cheese and carrots. He was knowledgeable about the type of mac and cheese and the way the carrots came (sliced or whole, etc) and a milk w lid.  We ordered, I got a French onion soup and jack chicken w shrimp and extra jack sauce, I wanted to trade out my sides for different ones, to which our server was happy to do. My husband got the French onion soup and salmon w rice and lemon broccoli as sides. Soup came quickly and was hot and we enjoyed it. My meal was very good, and the extra sauce came out on my plate (didn't have to ask again or wait!). My husband's dish was good as well. As always, I ask for extra things, and our server delivered w a smile and pleasant attitude. I ordered the Oreo for dessert w extra choc and when it came no whipped cream! I always get this, and it has always had small amount of whipped, I did notice new items on the menu so maybe this dessert now does not come w whipped cream, I asked and the server indicated it didn't come w whipped, but sure enough he ran and brought me a cup of whipped cream! He was great! My husband got the half size whiskey cake (new portion since last we ate at TGI Friday's) w a shot of Baileys. He enjoyed his dessert and the server remembered the Baileys as well. This is TGI Fridays, I realize. It's a chain. But this location deserves 5 stars for its service and greeters and management and food temp and presentation as indicated on the menu. Edited to correct spelling error and indicate whiskey cake",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-islandia,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
13,Aileen C.,"West Sayville, NY",16,7,,1.0,2017-07-05,"I recently moved nearby and thought ""oh perfect! A place to get some laid back drinks and apps"" I was so wrong. The food is not that good, and every time I order it comes out cold. I ordered the tomato mozzarella salad, and the tomatoes were old. Then I ordered a lemonade and vodka on a separate occasion, and the waitress gave me a jack and coke. I will never be returning, and I'd rather drive past to the Applebee's down the road.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-islandia,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12

Terrible service, the waitress barely came to the table and never cleared out the plates. Would give this place a zero.

0,Jim D.,"Queens, NY",359,421,7545.0,4.0,2017-09-15,"9.15.17.   TGI Friday's, Islandia, Long Island. NY. Hi Yelp friends and football fans. Are you ready for some football?!  Well I sure am!  I am so happy to see football season back again. Grab the cigars, I'm off to the bar! It was great to get together with the guys again for football.  Tonight is Thursday Night Football. Friday's has a great Thursday special! You can get a full rack of their delicious fall of the bone ribs for just 10 bucks. I am Sooo in. It didn't take much convincing for my friends to join me at Friday's, are you kidding? Gimme football, friends and ribs anytime, that's a combination that can't be beat. Everyone got the rib special and bottled beers were just $4. I also got a Stein of Sam Adams Oktoberfest on tap for 5 bucks, they didn't have any more Stein glasses so they gave me the Giant glass, I'm not complaining. The meals came out quickly, the Jack Daniels ribs were tender and crispy and so good. I finished my plate before everybody.  Next Up, dessert of course. I got the whiskey cake (Easy Choice), unfortunately the Whiskey Cake suffered a meltdown on the way out to me and could have been better enjoyed in a shot glass. hahahaha. My friends and I very much enjoyed our visit to the Islandia Friday's. The bar setup and decor was bright and appealing, the service here was courteous and quick and the bar staff was very attentive to our needs.  I don't understand the low Reviews here, the food was great and we all had a blast!  It really was a 4-star Football Ribfest.  JIM D.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-islandia,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2

1,Lady Love T.,"Greenlawn, NY",0,15,,1.0,2017-12-17,"20-25 minute wait for a restaurant that was not crowded.  This is the second time here and the same situation as the first time.  When we were seated, we were brought into the extension where the thermostat read 62 degrees. You could feel the frigid air blowing on your neck before you sat down.  Asked to turn up the heat or move us.  The thermostat was broken so it could not be adjusted.  Why sit customers there? It was warmer outside. Appetizers were fine. They were brought out hot.  The fries on all the main dishes were cold.  They tasted as if they were cooked the night before, sat under a lukewarm lamp for hours and served.  My cole slaw was rancid.  You could smell it across the table.  One burger was burnt and had to be recooked.  They still managed to burn it the second go around.  We had to ask for my neice's food three times.  Mind you she was the birthday girl and did not receive her food until an hour later.   I must say that the Manager did intervene and personally brought up piping hot fries and comped a few things due to the number of mishaps on the kitchen's part.  Never again though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-islandia,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
2,S. S.,"West Islip, NY",18,89,96.0,1.0,2018-01-13,"Actually quite shocked. Came on a Friday Night at around 9pm and this place was a ghost town! Usually I have gone to the Fridays over in Farmingville and it's always packed (the service and food are comparable to this place). My party stayed till around 11pm and this place never filled up. Clientele: a bunch of high school girls and a few families. The place was filthy as well! We sat at a booth that had extremely sticky floors and smelt like old beer and urine. Our Waitress Melissa was nice, cheery and pleasant. But the service was slow and almost non existent. We had to wait 10 minutes after getting our apps to even obtain silverware. Plenty of parking, the location is quite odd...right off the service road and vets hwy...not a pretty site. The drink I ordered tasted watered down and weak (I ordered the Irish Mule). I won't delve into the food with detail because it's your standard chain restaurant (applebees, chilis, ruby tuesday) food. It was eh and nothing special. There were ridiculous ticket times (we waited like 15min for drinks and about a half hour for apps)...I would be more understanding if the place was packed but it wasn't even close to being crowded. So anyway...next time I go out with friends I will probably pick a different place. The food was disappointing, service was slow, location is odd, and cleanliness was not a top priority.  Just a note: chain restaurants on Long Island and all around the Country are extremely disappointing over the past few years! Its all the same bland and microwavable food, cheap liquor and weak drinks, bad service and they are all filthy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-islandia,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
