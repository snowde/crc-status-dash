I get here just before 10 and this place is a ghost town.  Takes a few minutes before we are seated, then server disappears after giving drink orders. I was ready to place full order but Speedy was not in the mood to stick around after I said, ""water with lemon.""  As we wait for our drinks we notice on the other side of the bar - our same server taking another tables order - but they were seated after us. This gets us piss until we take notice that since we've entered no other servers ever appeared. Almost every time we come we get pissed off looking servers and I'm thinking it's because of the lack of help. Food was nothing to rave about - but it's cheap eats when you want to sit back and watch a game. We were just happy it was warm when it finally arrived.  Worst thing server could have done was given us the check and never came back. Didn't ask if we wanted dessert or if we needed to go boxes.

I remember when we would go to our local TGI Fridays in New Jersey when we were kids on a weekly basis, everything about the place says come in and have a good time, from the sports bar, the t.v.'s at the booths that you and your kids can watch while dining, or just knowing that they will always have something that's good to eat! With all that said I love how they've added the new appetizers, like the spicy ahi tuna crisps...so good, and the bruschetta is amazing!! They also have an extensively long cocktail list, and my favorite go to item for years on there menu has been there potato skins, with extra sour cream.

32,Khristopher B.,"Jacksonville, FL",133,93,95.0,2.0,2014-07-23,"I visited my local TGI Friday's recently because a group of friends and I were interested in the restaurant's new unlimited appetitizers promotion. When we got there, well, let's just say there are some things that the commercial should have mentioned before leading people on. First and foremost, if you order the unlimited apps, the waiter is told not to bring you a second round unless you have completely finished your first set. Second, you cannot change apps: if you ordered the boneless with parmesan garlic, that's what you will get all night. You can't even change the sauce to buffalo; it has to be parmesan garlic all night. Finally, you are not allowed to take your apps home with you. Before I forget, I just want to mention that when reviewing the additional tips for TGI Friday's, Yelp asks what days are best to visit this restaurant and, ironically, the popular days people have selected are Saturday and Sunday - not Friday. But overall, the service at TGI Friday's throughout Jacksonville is spotty at best unless you're at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jacksonville-5?start=60,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003

7,Kristina K.,"Jacksonville, FL",232,640,701.0,2.0,2015-01-25,"Before heading to dinner at TGI Friday's for a friend's birthday the other night we all talked about how we hadn't been to a TGI Friday's in a long time. After this experience it'll be quite a while before I go back. We arrived right at 5pm on a Saturday and I was surprised how full the parking lot was. We walked up to the hostess station and there seemed to be some confusion or issue (maybe that should have tipped us off). One of the hostesses was taking people who had walked in just before us to a table while a second apologized probably 3 times and told us ""someone would be right be with us"" (we were only standing there for a few minutes total). When the first hostess came back, the second told her (as she walked us to towards the table) that the chart needed to be fixed (as I said, lots of confusion). We were seated near the bar and given menus. We started to look at our menus and all three of us had picked out our entire meals but a waiter had yet to even stop at our table. I got up and went up to the hostess station to make sure someone knew we were there. As I was walking that way, our waiter finally showed up. Apparently he asked my friends if i'd told them what i wanted before i walked away. Like, really? When I walked back to the table, his ""apology"" was ""Yeah, I know, there are only two of us here tonight."" So...okay, then. We all ordered and when I ordered a drink rather than saying ""hey, can I see your id?"" he said ""if you guys are going to order drinks, I need ids"" like we were a bunch of idiots who should have thrown our ids at him (we're all in our late 20s). He acted like we were bothering him every time he came over (which wasn't often). Maybe everyone there was having a bad day but it was just a constant attitude, which was frustrating. The food was fine, though the menu was a little confusing. We had looked up the menu online prior to arriving and I saw their current promotion that includes a handful of food and drink combinations for $10. The only place at the table this was listed was in the little drink book and the names of the included meals on the menu were different from the ones online for the same food (the promotion materials called what I ordered ""sizzling citrus herb chicken"" while the regular menu called the same meal ""sizzling chicken and spinach."") That might be nit-picking but it struck me as odd. The chicken itself was okay, it was basically a plain grilled chicken breast with a sauce laid on top (I scraped most of the sauce off). It was served over spinach with a couple of mushrooms, a few slices of squash, and a pretty good sized tomato and mozzarella salad. I also got the light cosmo cooler, which was really good. The tomato/mozzarella salad and the drink were easily the best parts of the meal. The food was certainly not worth the production it took to get it. With so many superior options within a few minutes of this restaurant, I don't understand how they can run the place like this.

73,Lilly S.,"Cape Coral, FL",4,28,,1.0,2015-03-26,The worst Friday's I have ever been to. They should just close this one down. As long time Friday's patrons this is the worst location I have ever been to. If I could give it less than 1 star I would as it does not even deserve the one.  The service was beyond slow. We ordered apps and we told the waitress that was was for my and my husband was having the never ending and she proceeding in lecturing us that we could not share and that we would get in trouble and blah blah blah. Im not a child... I do not need a lecture. Cocktails were two for one but being the responsible driving I chose a soft drink. It had no fizz at all. The glass was all wet like it had been sitting on the counter filled aged ago and I was not offered a straw. My husband ordered beer and both came at the same time so he had to chug one straight down to so the other would not be cold. I understand the two for one concept but what a way to give a person a fast buzz when they do not want one. We waited and waited for our apps and then the waitress said she was taking our menus. Gee we didnt have the option of ordering dinner. So we told her we wanted dinner. Everything took forever. When the apps came they were cold. They had been sitting too. As I said before we are frequent Friday's guests so I know what it should taste like and the way it should be presented. As soon as the apps arrived our cold burgers arrived as well. Jack Danial's burgers are always our favorite and these were GROSS !!!! that is the best thing i can say about all of the food. To finally get of out check was like pulling teeth and then paying was even longer. The waitress was mad that we had points to pay for our dinners. Gee.... we are good customers at OTHER locations and deserve our points. Sadly we wasted them at this location. It will NEVER happen again.

I came in last night before our movie at Tinseltown next door because I was craving a Jack Daniel's burger badly. Met our friend and were seated immediately. Our waitress came by got our drink order and so far we were off to a great start, but sadly that's where it ended. It took several minutes to get our drinks. Then it took another 20 minutes for our food. There were hardly any other occupied tables in the bar area where we sat too. When she came with our burgers she informed my friend that they had tomato on it even though he'd asked for it without. She then proceeded to say how the cook gave her grief over it in the back, but that she could bring it back if it was a big deal. It wasn't for him, so we moved on but man, it left a bad taste in our mouths (so to speak).  The food was good. Garlic Parmesan boneless wings appetizer was delicious, the burgers were good though a bit overcooked but fine too. Our second round of drinks came faster, but still took long enough for me to eat several fries and have a couple of bites of my burger.  My issue is that I want to love this place. I am just a really big fan of that Jack Daniel's sauce and the bottled stuff isn't nearly the same as what I get at the restaurant.

0,Don R.,"Jacksonville, FL",443,203,1014.0,1.0,2017-01-12,"Throughout my entire life, I have one memorable experience as the absolute worst restaurant experience.  That experience was about 15 years ago, at a Bennigan's in Sacramento, CA.  I'm sure Bennigan's would be elated to know that TGI Fridays has earned the most recent poor experience award and has a companion with TGI Fridays in this top spot of awfulness.  No longer does Bennigans sit at the top of the poo list as they had for over a decade and a half.   We visited this location on New Year's Eve to celebrate a birthday party with 8 people.  We were pleasantly surprised that the restaurant was less than 10% full, which in hindsight may have been the big red flag.   I tweeted about my experience and quickly received a reply, ""We're sorry to hear that, Donald. Please email the details of your visit, the location, and your phone number to  .""  So, I take a substantial amount of time to compose an e-mail highlighting the many issues during our visit. What did Fridays do to earn this top spot of awful?   1. The service was slow and inattentive.  Again, the restaurant was less than 10% full. 2. The food was poor quality.  Dishes were not served as described on the menu and some things were horribly overcooked.  The bacon cheeseburger one person in our party ordered had no bacon.  The potato skins?  Well, one order had bacon and the other did not.  A request for a manger fell on deaf ears.  3. The drink pricing is simply out of line for a quick serve restaurant.  We were shocked at a charge of $23 for a double shot of well tequila.  A request for a manager fell on deaf ears. 4. The birthday girl ordered one of the shaker drinks.  It was good enough.  Her mom ordered one based on what was served and received easily 50% less drink.  Since she is a bartender, she asked to speak with the manager and instead the server came and took the drink to have it ""remade"" only to come back with the same drink with more ice put it the shaker.  Yet another request for a manager that fell on deaf ears. 5. There were other things that happened throughout our stay.  Menu items ordered were simply never served.  Drink refills were not offered and water was not refilled. 6.  We are not the folks that complain at every step of the way.  In fact, we have realistic expectations when choosing a quick serve chain restaurant.  But this list is not complete of the things that went wrong just for us.   I have been in the industry for many years.  I know that it is standard practice for a manager to visit a table when there are problems.  Never have I been refused a manager when I specifically asked for one, and truly who can say a manager refused to visit a table after 6 separate requests, and by several guests at a table. So, today I receive a call back today from ""Arlene"" in customer service about ""my social media complaint.""  I was asked to call her back and to ask for her.  I bite and call the 800 #.  It is some call center somewhere offshore.  Quickly it is obvious that English is a second language for these folks.  There was no attempt to transfer me to Arlene, but instead, as is the case with all these so called foreign customer service centers, the person that answers offers to help.  He pulls up something under my phone number and asks me to go through everything that happened again.  There is a clear communication barrier and I get sick of repeating myself 3 or more times for almost everything that I say.  I ask why some offshore call center is handling my complaint in which I asked to speak with a regional or district manager.  He says they are at the corporate office and they are above the regional/district management.  Is TGI Fridays corporate office located in the Philippines?  I end up losing patience and asking why my time is being wasted and if they expect this of all their customers who are trying to share a poor experience.  Eventually, after I pretty much lose it, I am told a regional manager will call me back at the number they have on file for me ""in a few business days."" I guess this is what I deserve for visiting TGI Fridays.  According to the customer service person, their corporate headquarters is located in the Philippines.  And even though I'm pretty confident this is not the case, this is what the customer service representative, who is higher up that district and regional managers, specifically told me. Fridays clearly doesn't value our business, and in this area there are dozens of far better dining options.  I'm surprised this place stays open...but I suspect they won't be open for much longer and will go the way of their closest competitor, Bennigan's. Some time after writing this review I was contacted by the Regional Director.  He said he was shocked about my experience at both the store and with their ""corporate offices"" in the Phillippines.  He offered gift certificates to ivnvite me to return.  Almost a month passed and I contacted the regional director again...still no cards...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jacksonville-5?start=20,2.04,2.04,2.04,1.4120000000000001,2.04
54,Rj A.,"Jacksonville, FL",45,117,234.0,2.0,2017-01-20,"So, went here for lunch with my coworkers and chose an outdoor seating due to the beautiful weather. It started out like any TGI Fridays experience where we were seated, served our drink orders, and ordered our meal. That's when the service went downhill, for me, at least. Everyone was served their lunch orders except me. I thought maybe the waitress just didn't have enough hands to grab all the food and will be right out with my order. It was when my colleagues were half way done with their meal was when I decided that they forgot my order. So I got up went inside and asked our waitress. She apologized and said she'll check on the order. 5 minutes later, still no food. So I went back inside. After waiting another couple of minutes, I got back up for the third time to ask. They finally came out with my sliders but missing the fries. I said fine but asked for side of mayo for my sliders. Again, nothing for a few minutes and I got up for the 4th time and told the waitress I asked for the mayo to eat with my sliders so it would be good for her to get it right away so I can finally start eating. Btw, still no fries. When I got all my food, the sliders were cold and all my coworkers were either done or close to being done with their meals. The zinger was when she finally apologized, it was to my coworkers, not to me and she blamed the kitchen staff for the delay. She never asked me how she can make up for my troubles, but did give my coworkers free deserts and waived their drinks, even though they all got their food on time. Btw, I didn't have any of the desert and had tap water to drink. So, no benefit to me at all.  This could be the worst TGI Friday's I've been to. I will say this, at no point was the waitress mean or disrespectful, just not very good at her job. That's my opinion, but my coworkers all loved her for bringing their food on time, giving them free deserts and waiving their drink orders.

I've never had whiskey in a Sangria before and this was accurately described, fire, tropical, spicy, sweet, and refreshing. To eat I got the Sizzling Chicken and Spinach and a Tomato Mozzarella Salad. Healthy stuff to go with my drink hahaha. Everything was good and hit the spot. But while trying to wait out the storm that popped up all of a sudden I became snacky and ordered the Mozzarella Sticks. Diet extra ruined. These came out faster than anything else did tonight!

And you can only order one app at a time. Then you finish your first app in 5 minutes and you have to completely finish it then place another order with your waiter. The entire process makes endless app completely not worth it. My waitress even asked me if my girlfriend was having anything off my plate because she was going to have to charge me an extra $10. She didn't even eat anything off my plate.  I said,""so you're going to charge me $10 if she has one bite?"" she said I'm just doing my job. Then I look over at the bar and I see people getting the shortest wine pours I've ever seen in any establishment. They're trying to save money by pouring little wine but in the end their losing money because you're not going to get a return customer. I would not pay for a drink at this restaurant because you're really only getting half of it. Girlfriend also ordered pink lemonade and it was like water and pink food coloring that tasted awful. I think our waitress goes on vacation after she puts down one of our weak meals too because I don't see her for 35 minutes. This place is empty and I can see why. This place just hands-down sucks.

I ended up going to the bar to ask if we could get a server, the bartender I spoke to was the rudest person I have ever spoken to in my entire life. After my confrontation with this rude employee, I walked out and will never return here again. Get it together TGI Friday's!

Then there was the agonizing, long wait to get our drinks - a margarita and a beer. We went with the endless appetizers and it took about 20 minutes for those to come out. I had the bacon nachos, which had about half a slice of bacon on them. Folks, I couldn't make this up if I tried. The amazing thing was that this place was at less than 50% capacity. So the excuse that they were slammed doesn't apply. Save yourself the headache and try somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jacksonville-5,1.56,1.56,1.56,,1.5600000000000003

50,J S.,"Lakeland, FL",0,2,1.0,2.0,2017-08-12,Very disappointed.   Went in to get endless apps which are very limited now on which ones.  Have watched the commercial countless times $10 endless apps!!!! Our bill came and waitress said that it had gone up to $12.99.   But they were very aware the commercials says $10.   Sorry.   Won't be back to this establishment.   $10 or $13.   Wasn't that good anyway.    Ask prices before you order....drinks were different than menu also.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jacksonville-5,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003
2,Lani K.,"Arlington, Jacksonville, FL",261,4,,2.0,2017-09-02,"Came in today at 2pm, only 6 other tables with people in the restaurant. It took about 10 minutes for our waiter to finally get to us. (There were 3 waiters working) For the restaurant not being busy it took quite some time for our food to come. The chips in the loaded bacon nachos were stale. The meatballs usually come with bread slices but didn't today. The chicken quesadilla didn't come with salsa. Our server never got us refills for our drinks until we were finished with all of our meals. Only gave this visit a 2 star because the food that did come was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jacksonville-5?start=20,1.64,1.64,1.64,,1.6400000000000001
43,Gracie Lou F.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,9,,1.0,2017-09-30,This place is horrible. If you call ahead don't expect them to get your order right or take less then an hour to get you order. My husband called ahead they said it would take 15 mins. And hour later he's still waiting. Nobody would even acknowledge him. After waiting someone finally came over. They are out of the soup we ordered and also didn't even get it right. What a disaster. How do you stay in business like this? On top of it by the time we got our food. It was cold. What a wast of time and money. If you are looking for anything from this place you will be disappointed. You are better off going to a fast food place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jacksonville-5,1.64,1.64,1.64,,1.6400000000000001
45,Craig H.,"St. Augustine, FL",2,30,14.0,1.0,2017-10-21,I am sitting here waiting on these folks to bring me my take out order. I called it in and they told me twenty minutes so I arrived at just that amount of time... only to sit for 10 minutes before the nice fellow behind the bar asked to take my order. I let him know I had a takeout order and now it's been another 10 waiting on him to come back. Apparently he's the only server in the whole place. I do see a manager type walking around that doesn't appear to be doing anything. This is ridiculous!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jacksonville-5,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003
38,Christopher O.,"Jacksonville, FL",38,72,84.0,1.0,2017-11-18,"We walk in to TGIFridays tonight to have dinner with our friends and two other parties are waiting at the host station. We asked what was going on and they said that nobody was there and it had been about 5 minutes. Finally a young boy comes up and asks one of the parties how many they had and they said 5. He quickly ran off after telling them that he had to clean tables...ignoring us. The other party got mad and left. He came back and seated the party of 5. Now it's just us, he asks how many and we say 8 and a high chair. He ROLLs his eyes and walks away. Then, he came back and said it would be 20 minutes because they don't have any servers available (the restaurant was empty).

I had a horrible experience here, the service was SLOW, the food took FOREVER and wasn't worth the wait.

37,Nick T.,"Southside, Jacksonville, FL",6,3,1.0,1.0,2018-01-08,"I couldn't even be bothered to put two stars on here. To start off with, our party had made a reservation however when we got there our tables weren't even out together. Literally it was as if our reservation didn't matter and was completely ignored by all staff. Secondly half of our party haven't arrived yet, so we waited patiently until they got there. But when we all ordered, food came out separately. Literally the people who were late got their food late and all sorts of drinks were mixed up. Had to ask for refills on drinks because the waitress didn't keep up with that. I had to wait for about a good 2 hours until my fiancé and I even got our food. My burger was decent but my fiancé had a very dry chicken and raw broccoli. Then we were told because of our bad service we would get 50 percent off on all of our orders but when we got our bills there wasn't even a discount on it. So we had to get the staff to redo all of our orders for the discount and even that took forever. This place needs a new make over. This place needs new management to be able to control everyone and everything. This place needs a serious make over otherwise this store will shut down. Shame that no ones doing anything about it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jacksonville-5,1.52,1.52,1.52,,1.5200000000000002

39,Millie S.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,4,,1.0,2018-01-14,"Had the worst experience ever at TGIF!!!  Horrible service and the quality of food was also horrible.  Ordered the French onion soup which barely warm.  The cheese was NOT melted and the croutons were not toasted!  I also ordered the 2 for $10.  The onion rings came out with no sauce...menu states it comes out with several sauces.  By the time I got my sauce, the onion rings were cold.  Sliders came out about 10 minutes later.  Bartender did not give me silverware until I had to ask for it and for some reason she had to go to the back to get it!  I was never asked by the bartender or the manager if everything was ok.  The manager on duty talked to the people on my right on on my left as it appeared that they were regulars....I am not a regular, so I guess I am not worthy of their time.  Never received a refill on my drink because the bartender seemed to spend more time in the kitchen rather than the bar.  When I was leaving I was going to stop by the host stand to speak to someone about my experience and there was no one to be found!!!   TGIF....you need to get your act together.   Will not be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jacksonville-5,1.48,1.48,1.48,,1.48
