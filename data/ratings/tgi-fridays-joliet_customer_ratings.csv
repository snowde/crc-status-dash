44,Jessica W.,"Plainfield, IL",21,8,,1.0,2012-08-12,"I've been to a lot of TGI Friday's in the past, and always thought it was decent food in a fun atmosphere. Well, this was my first visit to the one located at Louis Joliet Mall - and it was my last.  The food was pretty generic, and considering they're charging at least $10 for an entree, it felt like we were getting ripped off.  Our server did manage to smile a couple of times when speaking to us, but we hardly ever saw the guy. The place was pretty slow & I can understand if a place is really busy that the wait staff might get a little behind, so I'm not sure why our server was never around.  They forgot a side item my husband ordered, and when he asked for it we were told, ""Well, sometimes not everything you order will go through on the computer..""  ---- Huh??? ----We waited another 10 minutes to get finally get it.  My husband had to get back to work, so I told him to go on ahead and that I would close out the tab. Yep....waited another 10 minutes to get the check. If you're thinking about eating here for a quick lunch, you'll have better luck going to Panera Bread across the hall instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-joliet?start=40,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004

My servers have always been really polite and even remembered that we had some food allergy issues to contend with. I was pleasantly surprised with the changes in the menu from a few years ago and the variety. There are also a number of healthy options for the kids menu and I find that the chicken on the skewer always goes over well with my children.

31,Angela P.,"Aurora, IL",440,1743,13.0,3.0,2013-05-24,"Friday's has been low on my list of family-oriented chain restaurants.  I'm much more of a Chili's kind of gal.  But when I got some coupons in the mail, I held onto them for one of those ""we need to get out of the house for dinner, but we need to do it cheap"" kinds of nights. And that was yesterday.  It was surprisingly busy for a Thursday evening, but then I saw the $3 drink and appetizer specials.  The Long Island was just okay, I'd probably pass next time, but what do you really expect for $3?  The white queso was delicious, and well worth the $3. Our burgers arrived, and they were really sad-looking.  I know meat doesn't have emotions, but the burger patties appeared dry, and they were skimpy on the toppings.  They tasted fine though.  Fries were also limp. The service was friendly, but our server left dirty plates on our table when we were finished with our appetizer.  When he delivered our burgers, he still left the dirty dishes and walked away.  He later came back with some additional condiments for us, and just plopped those on top of the dirty dish instead of taking them away.  Three opportunities to clean those babies up, but they remained until we were done with our meal. I know I don't have to say that Friday's isn't a fine dining establishment.  But I wouldn't recommend this even for a date night.  Maybe a quick happy hour after work with some appetizers, or to use that coupon like we did. $29 for 2 alcoholic beverages, 1 appetizer, 1 bowl of soup, and 2 burgers with fries.  I can't complain too much about that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-joliet?start=20,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668

Can't really ask for much more. we come here when were a little short on cash and get the 2 for $10 meals, I always start with a classic wedge salad and it is SO good! Iceberg wedge topped with tomato, lots of bacon, blue cheese and blue cheese dressing. It's perfect.

47,Dolores U.,"Channahon, IL",291,14,10.0,1.0,2014-03-24,"Probably the slowest and worst service I have ever had. Came for lunch today with my fiance, we were immediately led to a booth by a nice hostess. We were greeted five minutes later by a waitress who whispered what we'd like to drink. Very unfriendly. My fiance opted for a bacon cheeseburger which he devoured and said was very delicious. I on the other hand, opted for potato skins and the BBQ chicken flatbread. The food came pretty quickly, but unfortunately my flat bread was ice cold.  I basically flagged down my server to send it back and ask for a side of ranch. She took it and said it would be remade. Twenty minutes later it comes out with onions. Too many to pick off. 15 minutes later the server asked if everything was okay, i told her no, because of the onions and she took the plate without apologizing and we were now on our third try to get the flat bread right. I reminded her that I still didn't have ranch when it was going on twenty mminutes of me asking. What happened next blew my mind. She went to the table behind us and chit chatted with them for about five minutes. Came back and put the ranch on the table. Finally third flat bread came out, warmer than the first one and with no onion. Still not hot. I just ate quickly and waited for the check. Took another ten minutes because the manager was comping the flat bread. Got the check, the remade flatbread was comped but still charged me for the first one. We weren'toffered a single refull the entire hour and a half we spent at lunch. i myself am a server and regularly tip 30% for good service but this was not worth a tip.

Friday fans and we've been to several locations in Illinois and other states.  Service at this location was not as good as the service we received at other locations.  I had to ask twice for silverware.   One suggestion I have is that when the food runners deliver the food to the table, before leaving, ask ""Is there anything else I can get for you?""  I saw the food runners just dropping off the plates to the tables and then walking away.  Our food runner left so quickly I didn't get a chance to say ""May I have silverware, please?.""  FYI, normally if the table does not have enough silverware, I will grab one off of a empty nearby table but all of the nearby tables did not have silverware. Fries were room temperature.  If I was planning to eat all of the fries, I would have asked for them to be replaced with hot, or at least warm, fries.  The room temperature fries made it easy for me to do my own portion control and just eat a few of them.

42,Lexy V.,"Montclare, Chicago, IL",0,4,2.0,2.0,2014-07-02,"Me and two friends call in around 10:45 on a Wednesday evening. We were originally thinking of going to MoJoe's, but they weren't serving the whole menu at that time, so we ended up here.  Our hostess gave our group of 3(a few younger under-age college students) a seat at a small table by the..completely crowded bar? Right away I could tell that the section I  was in was understaffed and overwhelmed. Our waitress-half of the reason for this 2 star rating- was doing her best to be attentive to not only the aforementioned completely crowded bar as well as the several tables she had to wait.  The manager seemed completely useless. He would start small chat then abruptly walk away..rude..and he came up to us noticing my friends' empty drink, and abruptly left without taking then cup or bringing her any beverage.  Ok..the drunk adults. I really don't know what kind of sad breed of Jolietian spends their Wednesday evenings taking shots of shitty, overpriced shots, washing it down with shitty, tap beer while ""Higher Love"" plays at a volume too high for regular vocal human interaction. Whoever they are, they are really loud and annoying. I'm not exactly trying to chastise their behavior-but don't seat my group of younger people by the bar. The biggest disgrace of all was the food. The Tennessee Whiskey Cake-the second half of this 2 star rating- was some of the best shit I've seen this side of the Mississippi. I won't go too much into detail, as it was only a glimmer on the sad December that was my dining experience tonight.. Ok, the bruchetta should have been brought out fresh before everything else was done being cooked. But no- The oil made the bread too soggy after sitting out. For shame. The pot stickers, meh. THEN..the sizzling chicken and shrimp. The sauce for the shrimp was a chunky, flavorless nightmare. The overcooked chicken added to this flavor-hating dish, and the microwave powdered mashed potatoes were certainly the finishing touch. I felt meek when i wanted a refund..at least for the disgusting entree, but I didn't want to make a fuss and paid and left.  I pissed away damn near $40 on not only repulsive, nearly in edible meal, but on a crowded, obnoxious environment and a flustered manager who didn't know how to conduct a business.

While the menu is no different from any other location, I have to say this one always has the most consistency when it comes to both quality food and service.

We were sat in the bar (which I usually don't like), but it was pretty lively. Our server wasn't great-he was very inattentive and on the slower side.

He seemed confused so I showed him the coupon again and he was able to take care of it.

When I was through with my first and requested the next dish I was told you can't switch. Really disappointing and misleading because the giant advertisement for this special says ""It's back!  Endless apps"". They should probably change that to ""It's back, but totally different than last time"" or at least prompt the servers to warn customers upon ordering that it's not the same. Last time I was here and asked why I didn't receive the special I was told you have to either sit in the bar or mention it upon ordering. Seriously, what's the difference when every customer is there to spend money? Why make us jump through hoops? Tried the new blood orange spritzer, meh just ok. Sriracha wings were good.

Right when we got in we got seated and the hostess was extremely sweet. We sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly as well. First we ordered some drinks. And honestly the best house Long Island I had in months. And only 4 bucks! We ordered some appetizers, mozzarella sticks which were alright and pretzels with beer cheese, TO DIE FOR. My boyfriend ordered a French dip sandwich which was pretty good but the au jus wasn't spectacular. The mac and cheese he ordered with it was phenomenal perfectly crisp on the outside. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich sampler which was good. The spicy honey on it was good but not much else to the minis. Overall enjoyed the food and atmosphere, if I'm ever in that location again I would go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-joliet,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
7,Jazmin S.,"Joliet, IL",12,58,22.0,2.0,2017-01-21,"This place was ok. I hadn't gone in years so we decided to give it a shot. Our waitress was great. The sesame jack strips were awesome, as always. What I absolutely did not like was where we were seated, which was right next to the hostess stand.  They were so loud!!!  It seemed like friends hanging out, not hostesses working. There was one girl in particular that was using so much profanity!!  I'll describe her because she annoyed me so much! Tall, skinny, curly haired. Lots of makeup. So unprofessional.  I guess this place is being run by teenagers, I will not go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-joliet,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

15,Carlos C.,"Romeoville, IL",4,15,2.0,3.0,2017-02-12,"Unfortunately could only give 3 stars despite the food actually tasting good. However they're drinks (sweet teas, strawberry lemonade) are like diabetes in a glass. They are not poured or measured I assume by the bartenders.  Also, they're service is sub par and the entire location seems to be in need of a good cleaning and new light fixtures it's very dark.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-joliet,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

12,Graham S.,"Joliet, IL",90,42,,1.0,2017-03-26,Well unfortunately my wife and I are sick after eating here. It has been an ok place in the past. Its just a Friday's after all. But after eating there my wife and I spent all day feeling horrible. I had no appetite and had bowel issues and my wife puked multiple times. We think it was the fried shrimp from the Jack Daniels Chicken and Shrimp menu item. We are both still getting over this 3 days after eating there. I guess bad shrimp can affect you for up to 10 days.  We will not be coming back after this horrible experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-joliet,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005

14,Lisa L.,"Chicago, IL",0,63,,1.0,2017-04-26,"Visited this restaurant on a Wednesday for dinner. I was really disappointed. The green bean fries were pretty good at first but minutes after being served they started to crumble. I ordered the black bean burger and my daughter got the quesadilla app. The burger was really greasy. I've never had this happen with a vegetarian burger before. The fries were only Luke warm and had obviously been sitting around a while. My daughter said the quesadilla had ""green things"" inside. I think they were peppers but were both hard and papery. When the waitress asked how the food was she didn't wait for an answer before saying ""great!"" And walked away. I really like Chilis and figured this place was comparable but can't think of a reason to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-joliet,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
3,Kevin B.,"Berkeley, CA",42,84,62.0,1.0,2017-06-02,"Dang, what a shame that I need to leave a 1 star review on this place. I have been a pretty big TGI Friday's fan up until just recently. Why? Well, they're open until 1am, the prices are decent, and the beer selection is more than solid (Lagunitas FTW). But let me tell you why they suck. First off, the beer prices here are more than fair. I do not know how large the ""tall"" glasses of beer are, but they end up costing right around $7. Paired with the $10 bottomless appetizers, this can make for a pretty affordable evening. But, please, read on. Because you know what isn't affordable? Or desirable, even? Being cursed at by the bar staff as you leave the restaurant. Sadly, on my way out, I heard some pretty nasty talk regarding a friend of mine and myself as we left a bit after 1am. Now, I am a grown man, and can handle being called names to my face. But this felt petty, and done with the intent of garnering laughs from co-workers. This type of behavior, I have no respect for. I was pleased with my food, and only at the end of my night did I find myself compelled to leave a negative review. Too bad. I think it is incredibly small and sad for the bar staff to act this way, but it is what it is. Dine in at the bar at your own risk. Otherwise, go dine somewhere where people won't judge you. These people need to grow up. Sad!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-joliet,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

6,Lisa G.,"Port Chester, NY",37,18,,2.0,2017-07-16,I love Fridays and used to go quite a bit.  It's been a while and took my parents there yesterday afternoon.  Was not busy. Got there around 3 o'clock.  Several tables were dirty and were not bused the entire time we were there.   Waitress asked us for our drink order and asked my parents for a tall or short draft.  They asked size difference and she said she would have to go ask.  They just decided on the tall.  Then she came back for order. We asked what soup of the day was and she said she would have to ask.  She was a nice girl but my guess was relatively new and didn't get proper training.   We waited well over 50 minutes for our order.  We finally asked how much longer and she went and asked and they said 1 minute.  During the entire time staff kept walking by the tables and didn't bother to bus them.   Our food came out and it wasn't hot. Luke warm at best. Was afraid to comment because it would take even longer.  Didn't see a manager til the end of our meal when he went over to 2 of the staff and asked them to take a table of 13.  Neither wanted to do it and they argued over it. It was crazy that we could hear the entire conversation. Paid over $70 for this meal and can say I will never go back to this location again.  The staff needs to have someone motivating them and working with them.  They had no respect for each other.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-joliet,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

Lol Well as my family & I were eating dinner & new waitress dropped a bunch of dishes w/food on them! Glass went everywhere & food! We got up cuz my son thought some shards of glass were on his legs. So we got up & shook off our clothes, everything seemed fine u till he took a bit of the mashed potatoes & there was a chunk of glass in the bit he took!! Thank God he felt the piece in his mouth before he swallowed it! So the manager Terry came out & took care of us. He took some money off the bill which always helps & gave my son a new hot double order of the creamy mashed potatoes!!! Now that's how customer service is done!!! And of course the waitress apologized & he did a bunch of times!!!and we went back the other day again & ""she"" was our waitress!! Lol all ended well & we left with full bellies!!! Too full!!!

17,Jonathan S.,"Joliet, IL",0,4,,3.0,2017-08-04,"Food is ok pretty average plenty of parking at the mall. We frequent here not because of the food but the dessert, the brownie obsession and the jack whiskey cake are absolutely phenomenal!!! I can't think of a better desert I would rather have. Just thinking about it makes me want to go buy some now, the serving size is enough for 2 unless you are really hungry in which case I would recommend 1 per person because once you start u can't stop eating it.

11,F A.,"Little River, SC",0,4,,2.0,2017-10-21,It's been awhile since my last visit iv always loved Friday's but I must say the price increase for the same average food is not welcome. It's a place of sandwiches and comfort food and $15 for an everyday sandwich is a bit high and mighty. Service was good we had an attentive waitress however sitting behind the host stand allowed us to hear and b apart of the serving world. Instead of being apart of dinner convo I was all too aware of who was getting what table and side jokes amongst the staff. T.G.I. Friday's is too expensive for my wallet at least get creative with the menu add an avocado something to justify the mark up.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-joliet,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
