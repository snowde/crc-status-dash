13,Jason C.,"Lawton, MI",34,110,7.0,4.0,2012-12-27,"Had the potstickers and jack Daniels sirloin. Both were prepared well and were delicious. Service was quick and friendly. I know it's a chain, but is one of my favorites and seems to churn out actual good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kalamazoo-3,,,,,
14,Heather W.,"Allendale, MI",0,46,2.0,2.0,2013-07-29,"Service was not at all friendly (smile, people!)..I've definitely been to better TGI Fridays locations. Their parking was a bit of a turn off as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kalamazoo-3,,,,,
10,Lee R.,"Wayland, MI",0,6,,1.0,2014-02-18,"The service was not good. She offered no refills on coffee. She was nice just not a proficient server and this was during a slow time.  The burger was ok. The fries were soggy, seasoned poorly and cold. Pot Stickers were good, pretzel rolls ok but the cheese dip was awful.  Vanilla cheesecake was not at all what I expected. Does not fit description. Not a cheesecake trust me and I do not recommend. Carmel cake with ice cream was ok. Very dry but ok. Nothing like the description.  I have no intentions of going back to that particular one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kalamazoo-3,,,,,
0,Ryan M.,"Carrick, Pittsburgh, PA",1,24,3.0,5.0,2014-06-14,"I was visiting friends in Kalamazoo and stopped at Fridays for a bite to eat. It was a Saturday afternoon. Upon entering the restaurant I was greeted immediately and seated within a couple minutes. My waitress was Lindsey and she did a great job. Shortly after being seated she asked for a drink order or any appetizers. She also gave the specials for the day.  We placed our order and the food came out exactly as ordered. I am a picky eater so I usually get mad if my order is not correct. The food was great. The service was fast.  It was afternoon so it wasn't as busy. I definitely recommend this place. If you do stop make sure to ask if Lindsey is working. She did a great job.   Thank you Friday's and Lindsey for a great afternoon Meal.

12,Michael R.,"Kalamazoo, MI",3,3,1.0,5.0,2014-12-30,"I visit this place usually once a week. I always have excellent service. I read a lot of bad reviews about this place, but I have never experienced those issues here. I usually sit at the bar, where Ian is #1 in town!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kalamazoo-3,,,,,
9,Shawn B.,"Mattawan, MI",56,152,115.0,5.0,2015-01-22,"I used to be a regular at this Friday's when I was in college. This though, was probably my first visit in at least five years. We stopped by on a Saturday around six, seated right away, no wait. The menu was very different, tons of good choices though and some old favorites. Always love the Jack Daniels chicken or steak. Highlight was the new drink menu! So many new and interesting drinks. It was hard to decide what to get. I opted for the blackberry Long Island and it was delicious. Came in a shaker and was easily the size of three regular drinks. Both my hubby and I had the jack Daniels chicken sandwich, fantastic, no complaints. We'll be back :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kalamazoo-3,,,,,
11,Julene A.,"Columbia, KY",1,19,2.0,4.0,2015-04-13,"Went here for a late lunch and split an order of the baby back ribs.  Definitely the best ribs we've ever had.  It took all of our resolve and discipline not to pick the bones clean with our teeth right there.  Before that we decided to try the new appetizers - the Thai pork tacos, ahi tuna crisps and the meat skewers.  All were delish, especially the Thai pork tacos.  For dessert we tried the Whiskey cake and it was okay.   Would have liked it to be more flavorful and less rich but we still enjoyed it.  My only complaint is that a table across from us was covered in dirty dishes and stayed that way the entire time we were there.  There was no excuse for that mess to be left there for so long.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kalamazoo-3,,,,,
8,George S.,"Battle Creek, MI",3,7,,1.0,2016-02-20,Well I cam back for more punishment.  Never again.  Two hours and still setting here. Our food took forever and when it got here half of it was dried out from setting under the heat lamp for a long time. My shrimp showed up after we were done eating.  The table besides us complained as well.  We are done wit this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kalamazoo-3,,,,,
5,Carl J.,"Ypsilanti Township, MI",0,13,2.0,1.0,2016-02-22,Came here Saturday afternoon was not crowded and there was only seating on one side of the restaurant. We ordered our food and it took about forty minutes to get it.  I ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp. It might have sizzled 30 minutes ago when it was made but the food must have been sitting under the heating lamps because what used to be melted was now a semi solid blob with some dried out chicken. Since we had been waiting so long to get our food I ate what I could because somebody we were with had to leave by a certain time. We never got refills on our drinks as well. We had to track down our server because we never saw her so we could ask for our check.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kalamazoo-3,,,,,
7,Red P.,"Kalamazoo, MI",58,2,,1.0,2016-07-18,"Severely going downhill. Short staffed, beer issues... like no beer on tap... Manager kept giving excuses... It was once an ok place",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kalamazoo-3,,,,,
6,Angel Y.,"Kalamazoo Township, MI",85,13,7.0,5.0,2016-10-23,"I was a bit stressed coming in because we didn't have much time to eat before our show at Miller Auditorium! Within 30 minutes, we had been seated, ordered, served and were out the door! Amazing!!! We ordered burgers and the food was wonderful (Jack Daniels and NY cheddar burgers). I highly suggest the Sang-Rita!  Thank you for the best service and food in the short time there! On a side note, Myles was our server, he is adorable!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kalamazoo-3,,,,,
1,Hillary S.,"Battle Creek, MI",24,73,54.0,3.0,2016-11-18,"I had not been to Friday's in several years since I moved to an area without one.  It used to be one of my favorite chain restaurants, but it was a bit disappointing on this visit.  Food was flavorful, but portions were small- the two chicken breasts combined on my skillet were smaller than one normal chicken breast at most comparable restaurants. Prices here also seemed to have gone up over time, although I was happy to see some smaller portion/value menu type stuff.   Service was good overall,  server was friendly, but checks got messed up a little at the end.  Restaurant was clean, everything seemed well maintained.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kalamazoo-3,,,,,
3,Matthew P.,"Farmington, MI",44,10,,5.0,2017-01-28,"Came for the mozz sticks, left with a free dessert. Our waiter Will was the living epitome of a saint. 10/10 would recommend. Legendary",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kalamazoo-3,,,,,
2,Gina I.,"Grosse Pointe Woods, MI",286,186,51.0,5.0,2017-04-11,I love TGIF and I also love Kalamazoo so I definitely had to try here. I've been here quite a few times now! The food and the service are always amazing and so are the drinks! The location is very convenient because it's right off of the 131.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kalamazoo-3,,,,,
4,Sheila B.,"Wayland, MI",4,3,,2.0,2017-04-22,The food did not taste like it should have. The server was nice. The food was not. The cheese was burnt on my chicken. The fries were cold on the shrimp and fries. The bill was over $80 and I expected the meal to taste good at least.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kalamazoo-3,,,,,
