1,Jodie O.,"London, United Kingdom",48,163,43,3.0,2012-06-17,"Stuck in Bluewater due to some sorta traffic thing, me and a friend decided to park the car back up and go have a few drinks (I wasn't driving!) and some food. There were huge queues everywhere, but TGIs had a bar, so we decided to eat there. Good points: staff are very helpful, our server was lovely. Food is huge and was hot. We were not rushed to leave even though it was very busy. Bad points: it's a little bit expensive (nachos being £9, burger £11). Cocktails didn't taste too great.  Overall it was enjoyable, but that might be more so because of the company I was with. I will visit again in a few months. Because I do love a good burger!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kent,,,,,

Service is hit or miss - on this occasion it was pretty damn good! Our waitress was attentive and friendly, and kept bringing refills of the bottomless fountain drinks before glasses were anywhere near empty. The food today was good - I think the key with TGI is what you order. Avoid the dry, overcooked burgers (such a shame that a chain specialising in 'American' food can't cook a decent burger!). They've recently revamped their menu. The new pork belly appetizer with red cabbage slaw is lovely, and the new main course version of the Jack Daniels crispy chicken strips is huge. We also tried the cajun chicken tostados - decent but a little dry, it could have done with more sauce and/or some soured cream.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kent,,,,,
