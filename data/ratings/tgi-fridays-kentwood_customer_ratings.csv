11,Charles F.,"Grand Rapids, MI",17,121,90.0,2.0,2012-03-07,"I went to this location on a Tuesday. Most of the restaurant was empty. To be fair, apparently there was a fairly large party that came in right before we were seated, but still, the place was mostly empty. It took forever for them to get us our food. And although the waiter was gracious and attentive, the wait was just way too long for the amount of people in the restaurant. It was a Tuesday, for goodness sake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kentwood,,,,,
6,Eric K.,"Wyoming, MI",0,3,1.0,2.0,2014-08-28,"Staff was rude. It was not busy we asked to be sat at bar side, after being seated we were told the specials were only for the bar. We asked to then move sense that's were we wanted to sit anyway they told us the bar was half full so we could not sit there. I ordered a drink when pored into the glass it was half full. Food was wrong. I like the food at TGIF's if I want something from a chain place but I will not be back to this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kentwood,,,,,
3,Aja W.,"Grand Rapids, MI",20,44,16.0,1.0,2014-09-05,"I don't know why, but one time I went here. I was a minor and the guy I was hanging with was two years older and could legally consume alcohol. He ordered this stupid looking red pinkish drink and kept insisting I take a sip. I refused because I am a former server and was aware we would probably be removed if I was caught tasting his refreshment beverage. It's not like I didn't want to also enjoy a pinkish red boozy drink but I couldn't do it discreetly and being caught would be embarrassing for a 20 year old mature adult such as myself.  Anyway, he wouldn't stop bullying me to drink the stupid drink so I took a half sip. Some employee appeared out of nowhere like the second coming of Jesus and had me crucified by the manager like I WAS THE ONE who was supposed to die for HIS SINS.  I guess TGI Fridays is required to not serve people under the legal age of alcohol consumption and this is taken very seriously, which in theory seems to make sense, but my argument is that their restaurant slogan is stupid and misleading because of such rule enforcement. Instead of ""Here's It's Always Friday,"" which suggests anything goes, cut loose, and have a good time, TGI Friday's should be called ""I'm Your Dad, Go To Your Room, & You're Grounded.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kentwood,,,,,
2,Veronica D.,"Burton, MI",189,180,216.0,5.0,2014-11-07,"Came here last night and had a very nice meal.  Was greeted at the door, had lovely service, and the food was spot on. Appetizers came out at a good time, and they had Budweiser on draft. The meal was a littleee pricey but, it's what you expect at a TGIF. I'd def come back! Great job everyone!(:",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kentwood,,,,,
5,Laura H.,"Grand Rapids, MI",40,12,,1.0,2014-12-19,"I was really disappointed with my experience here.  With regard to service: pretty bad. It took quite awhile for my waitress to arrive and take my drink order, and I waited a long time to get my food. It was not very busy - it was a Saturday night, but it was about 10:30 PM at this point, so there were not a lot of other customers. I will say the waitress was polite, but I don't feel I should have had to wait that long.  With regard to the environment: I was very, very cold. I was not seated near a window, nor was I seated near a vent (that I could see). I tend to feel warm more often than other folks, so for me to feel cold in a restaurant is not common.  With regard to the food: Decent. About what I would expect from a casual dining chain. The drink I ordered was terrible - a cherry limeade. I took one sip and stopped drinking it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kentwood,,,,,
9,Jessica K.,"Chattanooga, TN",0,2,,1.0,2015-01-12,"Our servers name was DREW. AVOID him at all costs if you must go to this place! Our server forgot what we ordered and the food was not that good. I liked the flatbread and fried mozzarella for an appetizer, but my parmesan crusted came with MAYBE four tortellini noodles and the sauce was oddly reminiscent of Prego's Alfredo sauce. My fiancee ordered a pulled pork Tennessee BBQ sandwhich and it was terrible. Tasted like old Arby's lunch meat with some Gordon Foods sauce on top. And trust me, We've lived in Tennessee. We know. Our server forgot our dessert too so that took forreverrrr. Finally when the check came out we my fiancee gave him him card to pay and the receipt he got said we were charged for $7 over our actual bill price. We told the server and he said ""Thanks for keeping me honest."" Was he trying to scam a big tip because he knew he did such a terrible job? Wow. Anyway he took our card back and we thought it was all settled but no. Behold two days later he has 2 charges from Friday's on his account. We call Friday's and spoke to the general manager, you know what he said? ""I can't refund you that's too bad."" Are you serious right now? I will never go back to this place and I highly suggest you do the same, lest you be paying double and more what your meal actually pays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kentwood,,,,,
0,Chris M.,"Princeton, NJ",163,24,6.0,2.0,2015-02-07,"Mediocre food, dismissive staff, and the worst milkshake of my life help keep TGI Friday's in the realm of chain food that is consistent in its disappointment. PROS They are open later on weeknights than some of the other options in the area, and honestly that is the only reason we went here in the first place. The menu looks very nice.  The restaurant was clean. CONS While we arrived later in the evening, there was still over an hour before closing.  This, however, did not stem the utter rudeness with which we were treated by the staff.  Our server seemed more interested in chatting on her phone and the bartender was clearly more into flirting with the few guys at the bar than making our drink orders. As far as food, it was ok at best.  The fries were so crusted in salt I could hardly get them down.  One of the other folks in our group ordered cheesecake - billed as ""New York Style"" - which was so runny he didn't even finish it. However, the big, bad of the night was our milkshakes.  Simply put, they were half ice.  Not ice cream.  Ice cubes.  When they arrived, we all took a long sip (or tried at least) and were greeted with chunks of ice in return.  These were no so much milkshakes as milk-smoothies that needed a lot more time in the blender.  When our server came by, we asked about the large chunks of ice in our shakes.  We were told that it was company policy to make shakes with half ice cubes and half milk (NO ICE CREAM HERE!), to ""make them more sip-able.""  More ""sip-able?""  We couldn't sip them because our straws were clogged with ice chips.  Maybe I shouldn't expect much from a shake at TGI Friday's, but this was horrible. OVERALL Don't waste your time with this disappointing version of a lackluster chain.  The staff certainly don't care if you are there, and your tastebuds will thank you for going somewhere (really anywhere) else.  The only reason I will give them two stars is that I can imagine (if I try really hard) how it could get worse.  Stick to the hotel bar down the street if it's late; at least you will have company!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kentwood,,,,,
7,Jennifer K.,"Traverse City, MI",92,4,1.0,1.0,2015-08-16,Food was decent.  Service NOT!  We went in at 3pm for appetizers.   Took too long to take our order.   Way to long for the food to come. Never came back to refill drinks.  Then charged me for more sodas than i ordered.   He was not apologetic to fix the bill and THAT took too long too.  Is not my first experience at the franchise having the same type of problems.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kentwood,,,,,
8,Jc N.,"Muskegon, MI",3,81,50.0,2.0,2015-09-09,"One of those, should of checked the reviews first and listened. Food was ok, tried some of the jack danials chicken, ribs and the cajun shrimp. Id give it a 6/10 for flavour. Service, or lack of, was what a many others have stated, little attention given, didn't even come back to check on us, or offer refills. I watched a server walk pass his table, the customers call to him and he just kept walking, until another table who herd them call tell him they were asking for him. The ""best"" drink they had was this margarita with their house special casamigos tequila, needed more sweet and sour, tequila didn't taste very good either, not for a $11/ glass. Overall we got full, but with the service and how the food was I do not think we will return, applebees is a better choice for this type of food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kentwood,,,,,
4,Jose B.,"Grand Rapids, MI",38,2,,1.0,2016-03-16,Just went here with my girlfriend and I tell you the worst freaking service ever I swear you will be lucky if you get served our waiter idk if he was on his break or what but not one other waiter even bothered to help us like seriously and this is my review on this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kentwood,,,,,
1,Suresh M.,"Ann Arbor Charter Township, MI",0,14,,1.0,2016-07-08,"I hate to say this, but this place is truly awful. The service was so bad, we actually had to get our own drinks from the bar.   The management did not care and the irony is there were only 20 other people in the restaurant on a Friday night. I was warned not to go here by the locals.  We should have listened, but all the other restaurants were packed. Now I know why were able to get in on a Friday night.visit at your own risk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kentwood,,,,,
