14,Yulun W.,"Austin, TX",18,87,15.0,3.0,2012-04-13,"I had my first Key West lunch here. When I walked in, the restaurant is pretty quiet, and the waitresses are kind. Since I am so familiar with Friday's, I placed my order very quickly.  The food is good as expected, but the service is a little bit slow. Thinking there are only few people to serve, the waitress took me about 20 mins for checking out. I am so eager to explore the Key West, so I am not so happy with the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-key-west,1.804,1.804,1.804,1.804,1.804

9,Blake S.,"Downtown St. Petersburg, Tampa Bay, FL",1,2,1.0,1.0,2014-03-10,Shit hole. Manager has no respect for the customer. The waitress messed up or maybe the cool. But no apology was received on my end.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-key-west,,,,,
24,Don G.,"San Antonio, TX",4,2,3.0,4.0,2014-03-12,"Service and food were good, similar to any other Friday's. Greater was not at the front when we arrived and it took a while for them to show up. Otherwise everything else was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-key-west?start=20,,,,,
29,Rob S.,"Apex, NC",0,19,2.0,1.0,2014-03-24,"Absolutely pathetic... I stopped in with my 8 yr old daughter. She asked for Raspberry Blue Slushy drinks. The waiter, very nice and tried like hell but was obviously working for the wrong place. He brought out my daughters drink which looked like blue kool-aid  poured over ice. I told the waiter this is obviously not a slushy with big chunks of ice. He apologized and took it back. He came back with another one, it looked like they hammered the ice chunks down to 1/4'' size and tried to call it a slushy. I ordered a Ruben sandwich. When it came out, cold as ice. No steam coming off of it and was room temp. If it wasn't for my daughter being there I probably would have really went off. However, I told the waiter to send it back and take the charges off my bill. My daughter was starving and it was late, so I let her eat her meal and she seemed to like it. There was a reason I haven't been to a TGIF's in 3 years and this visit reinforced it. I WILL starve before EVER going to TGIF's again! Do not waste your time or money here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-key-west?start=20,,,,,
27,Jessica W.,"Key West, FL",3,3,,5.0,2014-05-10,"Stopped in for a late lunch today with my husband and our friends. Our waiter was Kenny. He was great the whole way through!  Kept the food and drinks coming and always with a smile. We were never really left waiting for anything! We started with the spinach dip which was just ordinary spinach dip. Nothing fancy. Chips were good, nice and crunchy! I had the Rotisserie Chicken Salad Sandwich. It's pulled rotisserie chicken with Italian herb mayo, celery, red onion, chopped sea salted almonds, dried cranberries, and pickles. The chicken salad is served on multi grain bread with chopped romaine and vine ripened tomato. I loved it! Chicken salad was nice and chunky and had great flavors. The almonds give a nice crunch in every bite. I'm usually a ""stick with what cha' know kinda girl"" but don't be afraid to try this it was great! I subbed out the french fries with sweet potato fries. They were good.. Again, nothing fancy. My husband had the Cajun Shrimp and Chicken Pasta. Chicken and Shrimp sautéed with red bell peppers then tossed with fettucinni in a spicy Cajun sauce and topped with shaved Parmesan. I am extremely sensitive to spicy foods and this was not spicy at all. Noodles were cooked perfectly and the sauce was really thick which I like. All in all it was a very nice lunch. Having a kick ass waiter was a plus too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-key-west?start=20,,,,,
20,J L.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",0,12,,2.0,2014-06-19,"If you are not too hungry and can wait for your food, this may be the place. This was the second time in 4 years and it was worse this time. First we didn't receive. the appetizer we ordered. Second, the food took almost 30 minutes to be served and the place was empty. Lastly, my order was wrong. I had to wait for it to be corrected. Waiter wasn't attentive and the manager that answered my complaint didn't seem to really care about us coming back. Apology was weak. Eat local!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-key-west?start=20,,,,,
22,Debra P.,"KEY WEST, FL",0,6,,1.0,2014-07-15,"I wish my bf didn't like this place, but he was in the mood a few nights ago so we went.  The waitress was way to young and inexperienced.  After she brought his appetizer he called her back and said he did not have silverware. Her response was ""That is the hostess's job"" to us before she brought us our silverware.  She left us without taking our dinner order. We finally had to flag her down again to take our order after our appetizers were done. The girl who brought us our food was so young and inexperienced as well and got all flustered trying to figure out who got the steak and who got the chicken.  My streak was great but his chicken was burnt. My meal was ruined when the floor manager started scratching is bum a few feet away from the hostess station. We never tip below 20% but this level of substandard service for a $58 meal that only had one cocktail is just not up to par. Next time the bf suggests this place I will just go get him the dim sum he likes as take-out and avoid all these terrible experiences.  Oh well, at least the music wasn't blaring this time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-key-west?start=20,,,,,
15,Mike S.,"Key West, FL",0,3,,1.0,2014-07-28,"What a crap hole! We're local have been here three times. Every time we went the service sucked, the food was cold, dirty aged seating area, and wait yessss a totally clueless manager. Do your family a favor and just eat someone else and save yourself the trouble. And their a franchise not corporate so they don't honor the stuff you see on tv commercials!!! Three strikes and your out tgi Fridays!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-key-west,,,,,
11,Chris M.,"Jensen Beach, FL",0,26,,2.0,2014-08-04,"Went to this restaurant twice while on our trip because it was across the street from our hotel.  The first time was around 7pm.  They told us there was a 15 minute wait even though there were, at least, 15 empty tables in the restaurant.  We ended up waiting about 40 minutes; I guess that is 15 minutes on island time...  The food was standard Fridays quality, but they do not participate in any of the advertised deals.  The unlimited appetizer for $10 was not on the menu.  When we asked, they said it would lower the quality of their food to offer it, so they opted out...  Gotta love it! The second time, we arrived about 9pm.  There were probably 20 people in the entire restaurant, but we were still told there would be a 15 minute wait.  It took about 15 minutes before they seated us.  I am not sure why they take this approach, but it is what it is.   It is about 20 - 25% higher than Fridays on the main land, but that is to be expected, I guess.  Overall, it was a decent experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-key-west,,,,,
18,S M.,"Key West, FL",41,19,,1.0,2014-08-25,"What were we thinking?  My husband suggested we go but we were both fed up afterwards and we will NEVER, EVER go here again.    The hostess made us wait 8 minutes when there was hardly anyone in there and most tables were empty.  She finally graced us with her presence and acted annoyed that she had to do her job.    Then we waited  10 minutes for a waitress.   She was ok, but not great.  We're actually gluten free and their gluten free menu is really pathetic.  How in the world can they have gluten in nachos?  Oh yes - I know - because they are doing some sort of low-end substitution for corn chips or maybe some pared-down cheese, cut with wheat.    My husband's burger was dry and tough.  My chicken and cheese?  Disgusting!  Dry chicken too tough to chew, burned cheese and seriously, those 'mashed potatoes' weren't the least bit flavorful.  I don't think they were actually potatoes.   The place is dark and dingy and just totally uninviting.  We were both sick at our stomach when we left and we'll not ever go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-key-west,,,,,

5,Colleen C.,"Champaign, IL",0,12,5.0,1.0,2015-01-12,Every single person at the bar had to ask for silverware when their food arrived. Weak drinks. Bad food. Should have gone to domino's... seriously.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-key-west,,,,,

19,Nikki S.,"Deltona, FL",63,5,,1.0,2015-07-17,"I only gave this review one star because the waitress at the table next to us actually cared to ask what was wrong. We made a reservation for 8:30, waited for 5 minutes for our table (no biggie, it's a Friday night right?) we got to our table and ordered everything at once because we were starving! Our apps didn't come out for 45 minutes. (Also mind that I am a server!) NO APPETIZER SHOULD TAKE 45 MINUTES! We then asked for the manager and she offered us a soup/salad or dessert. Cool. Then she also argued that it only took the apps 17 mins.... K either way apps shouldn't take that long?? When it came to the bill she didn't discount anything??? Worse experience ever at a restaurant. I guess being on vacation in key west we should have actually went to a ""key west"" style restaurant. Oh I forgot that for a Friday there was maybe 10 tables in the restaurant. THERE WAS NO EXCUSE FOR IT BEING BUSY.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-key-west,,,,,

21,George C.,"Summerland Key, FL",1,6,4.0,2.0,2015-08-01,"As a Local, I find it safe to say that this TGI Fridays should NOT be at the top of your list of places to eat at in Key West! With all of the options Key West has to offer, this place is just another chain restaurant. The reason I gave 2 stars is because the service was not bad at all, but then again, I was here at 11:20 am on a Saturday and we were literally the first people in the place. Maybe, that could be the reason for good service? Otherwise 1 star would have been perfectly acceptable to give this establishment! The only reason I came here was for the endless appetizers advertised all over TV. Only to find out that this is privately owned and they do not honor those specials, ""because of this being Key West and the cost of the food is higher"". Fool me once, shame on you!
