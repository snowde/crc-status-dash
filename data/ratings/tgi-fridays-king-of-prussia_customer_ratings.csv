23,Summer K.,"Collegeville, PA",0,54,,5.0,2012-01-07,"I usually like these kind of restaurant but I had a good coupon to use. That's why I went here first time. Now I am big fan of this place. Their foods are incredible! I love their pasta and oreo cake! I usually go here after 8 pm, so I've never waited for seats.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia?start=20,,,,,
11,James S.,"Harleysville, PA",159,491,497.0,3.0,2012-01-12,"I consider Friday's to be the nice version of Applebee's.  Similar food, but I think the quality is noticeably better.  This Friday's isn't half bad.  It's located in the King of Prussia Mall, so the area is a plus.  This side of the mall doesn't get as crowded for parking, which is another bonus.  They always have some kind f special in the menu like 3 courses for $16, 3 courses for $12, or 2 courses for $10.  Long list of appetizers, which I love.  The Jack Daniels menu is awesome.  Friday's won't blow anyone away, but I like it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia,,,,,
4,Jamie M.,"Conshohocken, PA",629,859,708.0,4.0,2012-02-23,Came here for an Valentine's Day dinner with a friend. There was no wait since we sat in the bar area. Our bartender/server Lauren was a lot of fun (plus she remembered me from a previous visit).  The drinks were good and strong and the food was good as well. 4-stars!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia,,,,,
2,Steve S.,"Glenolden, PA",334,945,282.0,2.0,2012-03-21,"You don't go to Friday's to get anything special.  You go there when they have a deal like 2 for $10 such as right now.  At least this cheapskate does.   The food is what it is.  Like every other chain restaurant, it isn't bad but it isn't great.  The Dragonfire Chicken is neither fiery, nor is it particularly dragony.  It was a very colorful name for a very bland dish.  The chicken tortilla soup was better.   Service at the bar was quick.  I do believe the bartenders pay a little more attention to the people with alcoholic drinks.  The people next to me were offered refills on their drinks while I was ignored (I didn't even want another one, I just decided to test them to see if they would notice).   Meh describes it perfectly.  But you couldn't beat the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia,,,,,
17,Miguel G.,"Norristown, PA",17,139,1.0,2.0,2012-05-16,"I don't come here for the food, I don't come here for the drinks, I don't come here for the service. Actually, I don't know why I come here anymore. I used to go because my friend dates one of the waitresses and we would always get the hook up with drinks. But now they changed managers and that don't fly anymore. The one bartender lady is weak, as in she can't make a drink if her mother's brother's sister's life was on the line. No positives to this place really, it just feels mean to give it a one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia,,,,,
19,Chris D.,"King of Prussia, PA",0,6,,1.0,2012-08-30,"Went to Fridays for a burger and fries for lunch. How in the world do you mess that up! I'm so tired of restaurants serving cold food. I ordered the Angus cheeseburger and my wife ordered the Jack Daniels burger which looked nothing like the tv commercial.  My burger was cold, my wife's burger was Luke warm with a stale bun. The beef patties looked like the patties you buy in the store and taste the same.  We were really shocked how bad the food went down hill since our last visit a year ago. Fridays was always our ""go to"" spot for a quick lunch or late night snack. Not anymore, such a shame...   On a positive note the waitress asked if everything was ok and I told her about the burgers. She was willing to have them make a new hot one for me and take it off the receipt but I declined since we were pressed for time.   Our waitress notified the manager who apologized and took the burgers off our receipt. So we ended up just paying for our spinach dip and 2 sodas which totaled $15.  The manager was nice but i had the feeling that she didn't blame us for not wanting to eat the food.  Sorry but i can't recommend Fridays as a ""Go to"" spot anymore...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia,,,,,
18,Michael L.,"Collegeville, PA",0,8,,1.0,2012-11-19,"I'm not a huge fan of Fridays. However as Fridays go, this one is a mess. Bartenders drinking behind the bar. Took 20 minutes to get our drink orders in. Took almost 30 to get our drinks after that. Food was par for Fridays. They had empty tables galore and they took 15 minutes and stuck 5 people at a table meant for 4.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia,,,,,
9,Wayne S.,"Bridgeport, PA",1,3,1.0,2.0,2012-11-24,"Just finished my meal would rather eat at the food court.   Appetizers, pot stickers, were burnt and I sent them back.  My chicken bruschetta  was luke warm what a waste of $100.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
8,Jane O.,"Sterling, VA",118,37,27.0,2.0,2012-11-25,I was a little disappointed after my visit to this Fridays. I went on the Monday of Veterans Day weekend.  I'm not sure if management was not aware that it would be so busy or if they just didn't have enough staff but for whatever reason service was SSSOOOOOO slow!  We had a 10 minute wait to be seated but that wasn't a problem.  But after we were seated and placed our drink order it took about another 10-15 minutes for our margaritas to come out.  Our appetizer and the kids food was the only thing that came out at a decent time.  But the rest of us had to wait.  It took over 40 minutes to get our food and since we were with kids they started getting fussy so we had to take our food to go. I will say the manager did give us a discount on our bill for the long wait The spicy queso dip was very yummy!!! I do recommend you try it.  Our petite sirloins were still good after having to reheat it at home.  I'm a big fan of Fridays food so I would go back to eat but I don't think Id go to this specific location again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
6,Liz F.,"Philadelphia, PA",220,248,2.0,2.0,2012-11-26,"Two stars mostly because I sat facing a picture on a wall that clearly had printed ""signiture here"" WHAT!  Learn to spell, people.  You're really adding to the problem of our spelling impaired, auto-correct, spell check dependent youth.  I wanted to take a picture but two women sat down and I didn't want them to think I was crazy.  It's on the same wall as the bathroom, up by the bar.  See for yourself.  Fridays is your typical family suburban fare.  There's nothing extraordinary, just a lot of fried calories.  We got some blackberry long islands that were pretty delicious. Service was good.  Everyone was very nice and food came out fast.  My friend left his credit card at the restaurant and got it back without any problems. Not a bad spot if you're in a pinch at the KOP mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
7,Deena S.,"King of Prussia, PA",21,41,,4.0,2013-01-26,"Thank you Friday's, for your awesome customer service and a nice cold beer when a girl needs one :) the reason I'm giving it four stars is because the fruit flies.. they're kind of swarming around the bar area.. they are harmless but such a turn off.. plus, not an issue you want to have while trying to watch a game",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
1,Steven B.,"Orlando, FL",4382,1179,825.0,3.0,2013-03-05,"I'm sure that near the end of every week millions of people can be heard to say ""TGI Friday!""  I'm certain that 99.99% of them are not talking about this chain. These folks would never ever be a destination restaurant for me.  It's just a place to grab something while the lovely wife trashes our charge cards at the mall.  So I was there on Sunday and sat at the bar.  The bartender was fine.  My drink was fine.  I ordered the Chipotle Yucatan Chicken Salad.  It cost me about $10.  It had too much dressing but otherwise it was spicy and fine. When I go here I don't have a good time but I don't have a bad time either.  I just have a time.  So I'll give them three stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
24,Lish G.,"Frankford, Philadelphia, PA",29,9,,5.0,2013-05-08,"Love the food and the service I always get the sizzling chicken and shrimp, strawberry lemonade and brownie obsession. the food is so good. this is the only place that has food drinks, entrees, and deserts.

0,Sheldon S.,"Manhattan, NY",553,189,85.0,3.0,2013-06-24,"Went to Friday's with a large group yesterday evening. We had an extremely large group that for the most part was accommodated well. The server was very attentive and with the exception of one person, got everyone's order correct. My food happen to be cooked (prepared and heated) very well. The meat was tender, sauces were cold (when needed to be), and rice was warmed at a decent temperature. Where as all these things may seem trivial and not needed to be mentioned, I've had many very different experiences at Fridays. Now that my last visit to the franchise has been positive, perhaps the universe will stop placing me in situations where I'm surrounded with people who seemingly continuous to have me eating at Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
3,Danan R.,"New York, NY",813,1699,31.0,3.0,2013-08-03,"It's your standard TGI Friday's with the typical food offerings.  My balsamic-grilled chicken caesar and spinach flatbread were decent, and the $10 price was great.  The chicken itself was tender and the balsamic glaze was a nice touch.  Dad was very happy with his Jack Daniels Burger and the accompanying fries were nice and crispy, although I did have to add a sprinkle of salt.  Our server was very sweet and it didn't take TOO long for us to get our food, but we definitely had to wait a good 10-15 min. for it to arrive.  Otherwise, it's a solid-enough option at the KOP Mall for a sit-down fast-food style meal when you want something other than the food court.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
14,Jen D.,"West Chester, PA",118,5,,2.0,2013-09-14,"Although the food is good, the service here is horrible. Want a beer? Better be ready to wait a half hour. We also got centimeter crisps that they call ""fries"" . I don't recommend this. However we did get an extra plate of fries in place of the stubs so I guess that was a win!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
