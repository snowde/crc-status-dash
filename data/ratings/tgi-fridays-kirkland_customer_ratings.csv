2,Chris L.,"Redmond, WA",18,10,,1.0,2014-01-30,"I remember coming here years ago with a buddy to celebrate something, we were seated and promptly ignored for the rest of our time there.  We let the manager know our experience and she tried to make up for it with some free appetizer coupons.  Passed on the coupons, just asked for better service next time.  Unfortunately, our very experienced waiter of 13 years walked by and uttered an obscenity under his breath quite loudly. We weren't even given a chance to try their crappy food. Good riddance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kirkland,,,,,
1,Steve W.,"Kirkland, WA",0,2,,1.0,2017-03-19,"There website sucks as much as there service and food, my brothers dog wouldn't even eat the greasy  pile out of the ""doggy bag"" and he eats cat shit out of the litter box. Save your cash and digestive system and go to any other restaurant. The Kirkland location closed years ago and I was stupid enough to try this garbage dump while in SoCal last week. Food sucked service was worse and it cost as much as someplace that actually cooks food instead of reheating slop in a microwave. Shitty food shitty people stay away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kirkland,,,,,
