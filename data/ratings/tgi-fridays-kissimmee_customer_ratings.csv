54,Keyfer M.,"Orlando, FL",0,1,,4.0,2012-01-02,"We recently ate Dinner at this Fridays after recieving enough Stripes points to qualify for a free full rack of ribs  (TIP: Stripes is TGIFridays loyalty card that anyone can get from the website).  (TIP: If you like eat out, then I highly suggest looking at any restaurants websites because many establishments will offer great deals to loyal customers.) We arrived on a busy friday night. It's located about five miles down from the the Old Towne amusement/tourist area, so some nights can get busy, especially the bar area.  (Tip: half off select appetizers during happy hours)  We wanted to take advantage of the ""half-off"" appetizers in the bar area during happy hours; but all booths were taken so grabbed a high top close to the bar. Service was prompt and friendly.  (TIP: when you sit in the bar you are most likely going to have a bartender wait on you. Many times this means faster and better service since a bartender doesn't have to wait for his drinks to be poured.) We shared a an order of the buffalo wings. they were good. Then we split a full rack of ribs, fries and slaw. Fries were not cooked to order (old and cold). Ribs were a little dry but Pour some of that Jack Daniels (mmm..good) sauce on it...and it's on!!!  Overall...enjoyed the food and service.  (TIP: theres a great waiting lounge with comfy couches and flat screen tv. Afterwards, walk off the big meal at free Old Towne after the meal. There is also a Krispy Kreme doughnut factory within a mile or two.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kissimmee?start=40,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003

My list of hated restaurants is made up almost entirely of chains. However when my husband and I visited Florida, we stopped at TGI Fridays because we had a coupon. Imagine my immense joy when I found Korean BBQ tacos on the menu! Let me just tell you a little bit about me. I love Korea. I love everything about Korea. Now, these tacos didn't taste like bulgogi or kalbi (Korean beef BBQ). However, they had a generic Asian taste that was actually fresh and delicious. I wouldn't run to a TGI Fridays and tell the world to try these Korean BBQ tacos. However in a pinch, I would recommend them. I hail TGI Fridays for offering even a pseudo Korean option. Fake Korean is better than no Korean! The service was awesome, and the beers were cheap. Thank you, TGI Fridays for adding Korean BBQ tacos to the menu!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kissimmee?start=40,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284

45,Thomas C.,"Apex, NC",0,3,1.0,1.0,2013-03-24,"I'd give it zero stars if I could; it was a terrible restaurant experience, the worst I've had in years. I can't even narrow it down to one area; all areas were equally bad. First, we decided to eat at this TGIF because the parking lot was nearly empty of cars and it was 12:15 pm, prime time lunch hour for a Sunday afternoon. Our party of three walked into the restaurant and the first thing we noticed were people waiting to be seated with half the restaurant, to include the bar area, empty of customers: UNDERSTAFFED. When the hostess finally arrived to the front, she informed us it would be a 15-20 wait.  I looked around in amazement at the half-empty restaurant and asked her why the wait.  She answered the restaurant was suddenly rushed with customers and the wait staff couldn't handle the load. I told her TGIF had a YOU problem that was quickly turning into a ME problem. UNDERSTAFFED As I was in the waiting area, I noticed the hostess was also pulling double duty as a waitress as well as the bar manager, franchise owner and his wife. UNDERSTAFFED After the aforementioned 15-20 minute wait, we were finally taken to our table.  As I walked there, I noticed a strange thing; NO ONE was eating, they were all waiting for their food. UNDERSTAFFED The waitress took our order consisting of two of their 2 for $10 specials.  It took FOREVER to receive our appetizers and, of course, they were stone cold when they arrived. Much later, our entrees arrived, and you guessed it, they were also stone cold and cooked improperly.  My cheeseburger was cooked to death, dry and didn't look anything like the picture in the menu.   My wife's pasta dish was also cold and unappealing.  The waitress asked us if we wanted it fixed, but we told her we didn't have another hour to spend there. I won't be back there and I encourage others not to go until they solve their staffing problem.  I did find it ironic that when I was waiting in the beginning; an off duty wait staff person called the hostess and asked if they were on the schedule for today.  She replied, ""No, you're off today"" in which I told her ""You might want them to come in, it looks like you need all the help you can get"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kissimmee?start=40,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.9240000000000002

Usually, I end up getting disappointed after going to eat at food chains but what a nice surprise to have everything we ordered be so delicious! From the Spinach flat bread to mozzarella sticks, they had that pop in your mouth flavor that is rare to find... Not too strong or over powering and just right. Hubby ordered a lime tequila drink and seriously it was made to perfection. Haven't had a great drink since I lived in NY. Even on SoBe they water their drinks down.... Not here though... Hubby ordered petit steak and i ordered some chipotle bbq half rack ribs.... Makes me sound like a piggy but i.share... Lol. I'm a picky eater and this plate was heavenly.... The sauce was not too spicy n with just the right kick! We ordered that new special each $12.99 but since it was still early 3pm we got the lunch special special which came oug to $10. Bucks each...

Others had the chicken salad sandwich, all were served rather quickly. Oh I forgot to say we had the fried string beans for an appetizer.

We waited for about an hour which could be expected due to the day.   The food was hot and delicious except for my sister who asked for a medium well steak and it came out well done.  However she's pretty flexible and didn't mind too much.  The reason for my 3 stars is that my younger sister got food poisoning from what we assumed was the mac and cheese.  We came to disney for her so when she was too sick to head out to the parks the next day she was pretty bummed. Roxanne was our server and she was fabulous.  So all in all I would suggest this to someone if there wasn't many other options but make sure they stay away from the mac and cheese!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kissimmee?start=20,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005

33,Stephanie R.,"Long Beach, CA",2,5,,3.0,2016-11-21,"The ONLY reason I am giving this place any stars is due to a server named CHAD L. He has ought to be the nicest server I've come across in a long time! He was not our server, he was serving the table near us but was so friendly to all the kids, talked to them and helped them. Even came by our table to say hi to my daughter. He is also the only staff member who seems to move with a sense of urgency.  Now besides Chad, terrible service! We waited at least 10 minutes to even be greeted by our server. We ordered our drinks and appetizers. ANOTHER 10 MINUTES just to get our drinks. Mind you, it was not even busy in there. And almost all of us ordered water. So twenty minutes of sitting there, we could finally enjoy our drinks... About 5 minutes after our drinks come out, one of the appetizers we ordered finally hits the table. We thank our server and she walks away. We figured the other appetizer was coming out shortly. NOPE. 15  minutes later she comes out with our meals. We mention to her that we never got our ordered appetizer. She tries to tell us we only ordered one. pfft. After she checks her little book she then 'remembers' that we ordered another one. At that point we don't even want it anymore. Food was ok. Server was the worst I've ever experienced (and I've experienced some pretty crappy ones).

The food was ready in about 15 minutes but was very disappointing. To start, the food was lukewarm at best and little effort was made to prepare it correctly. Those who ordered the Veggie burger had a quarter size amount of sauce on the burger which was not enough to mask the freezer burned taste of the burger itself. One member of our party didn't even get the top bun on her burger. We also received ranch instead of blue cheese, which may be a common mistake but the receipt clearly said blue cheese. I had to force myself to eat or else I would have gone to bed hungry.  The only somewhat good part of the experience was the person who greeted us was nice, but that is expected in any establishment.

We stayed at Star Island Resort, which is right behind Friday's. After a long day at Magic Kingdom, we stopped here for food a couple beers. Our server Waylon was great. The review is strictly on the food. My dad ordered a steak cooked medium. He's never had a bad steak here and this was extremely over cooked and chewy. Waylon was quick to bring out a new one. This was cooked better, but still chewy. My mom ordered the bourbon chicken and it was very dry. Almost inedible. I had the Mediterranean Shrimp Naan and after a couple bites, realized it wasn't shrimp. It was Mahi Mahi. It was delicious, and I would have eaten anything after a long day at the park, but not what I ordered. Waylon was great and tried to accommodate us as best as possible. We were surprised the manager didn't come out and speak with us. We had many, many issues and it would have been nice to talk to him or her about the kitchen issues. We stay at Star Island a lot, and Fridays offers room service to the resort, but even the closeness and convenience will not lead us to get food from here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kissimmee?start=20,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24

Decided to venture 5miles past my celebration Applebees (which is just okay)... I was craving TGIF and their apps; wanted something diff. As soon as we walked in door, we were hit with a distasteful odor. You know the smell... stale beer that got left behind while bartenders rush to get off duty... Dirty mop water floor... I looked at my friend as was like ""we made it this far"" and he nodded in agreement to sit at bar. So we did. Two gentlemen were behind bar. One white bald dude and one dreaded out black dude. Gotta give it to them, they were amicable but at the same time bothered. The white guy got elbow deep in cleaning his bar to close out while the black guy served everyone, including tables behind bar. We both ordered a draft beer which was great & COLD! Server had a great smile and was nice, accommodating the guy next to us, showing him a pic of his baby girl (a kitten). I knew Fridays had endless apps... when asked for specials, my server said, nope, and pointed to menu for options at hand. So I ordered spinach flat bread and skins. Food came fast, really fast, but it was not pipping hot. Later on, I noticed a pamphlet near register promoting endless apps... so I asked the White server, did they have endless apps (while his arms elbow deep in cleaning), he said yes, 24/7. Right then I thought, I NEW IT!  TGIF closes at 2am. At 12:15 the tvs were off. So, yea if your cool with hanging at stinky restaurant getting cold beer, no tv, slow service (beer took a while to refill and every refill he thought we were done and ready to go), so I felt pushed out and eventually we left.

We shared an appetizer; 2 of us had steak-based entrees.
