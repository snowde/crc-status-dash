2,Azraai A.,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",253,540,1043,5.0,2015-03-01,"I woke up from my afternoon nap last Sunday feeling terribly hungry so I called up a friend of mine and lo' and behold, he was also hungry (we're always very hungry.) So we decided to have an early dinner at the nearest Fridays. We reached there at around 6pm and proceeded to order our food. I settled for the sizzling chicken and shrimp, garlic and prawn pasta (to share) and my friend ordered the good ol' fish and chips (yes, we we're very hungry.) Since it was my first time ordering a pasta dish from Fridays, it turned out to be quite delicious actually, I would highly recommend it to anyone and the portion was enough to fill all four of my stomachs. The sizzling chicken and shrimp is perfect per usual and I always ask for more cheese on mine but my friend had a little bit of bad luck with is fish and chips as it came out to be a little on the dry side. Don't be afraid to order the pastas at TGI's, burgers and steaks there are excellent too but it's always good to try new things, who knows?

1,Anna A.,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",5,135,139,3.0,2015-04-19,"I remember when Friday's first opened in Malaysia and how exciting and different it was for us then (I was still a teenager.. how time flies!). From their quirky outfits to them serenading you on your birthday, Friday's was the first to introduce the whole American restaurant chain concept here. Pretty much everyone I know has eaten at least once in a Friday's and the outlet in MidValley has been frequented by me a few times a year at least. It's the place to go when you're hungry and need some decent food quickly. Plus they have a ton of food choices from salads, burgers and even steaks. Recently they launched a new Meal for 2 menu where for RM45.90++ two people can have a meal complete with starter and one entree each. Considering the prices of restaurant food these days, this is a pretty good price. The other day I went there with 3 friends and had this set meal. We shared the chicken fajita nachos and nacho cili rolls as a starter and I had a cheeseburger and and 2 of them Fish and Chips for our mains. My burger was quite good; not the best I have ever had but satisfying nonetheless. My friends said the fish and chips was also OK, I mean they both finished all the fish and most of the chips so I am guessing it was also pretty good! Service here is just average. The servers aren't as attentive as they could be and you may find yourself waving frantically to get someone's attention. It's not that they are rude or anything, just that they seem to be in their own world and not focused on their customers at times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kuala-lumpur,,,,,

Just a note, I had to ask for chilled water as they brought me warm water for some reason.  I also had to ask for ice in my soda.... Servers were very nice.  I ran into a credit card issue with the new chip vs swipe technology.  I ended up having to pay in cash and was 90 cents short.  The server said it was okay seeing how stressed I was about payment.  That made my day!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kuala-lumpur,,,,,
