116,Patrick L.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",71,199,52.0,5.0,2012-03-04,"Happy Hour All Day Sunday! How can you go wrong! Park the car, walk into the restaurant and walk straight past the hostess and into a nice seat at the bar. No waiting, just a few steps in the door and you are sitting at the bar ordering your $5 Ultimate Margarita or Long Island Ice Tea. Appetizers are all 1/2 off (except the platters) The bartenders are always awesome and clearly enjoy their jobs. I would suggest the Spinach and Artichoke Dip, Pot Stickers and an oreo madness to finish it off. Great service. Great food. I honestly wish they would bring back the flair. That is what made Fridays so unique compared to being just like everyone else know. The highest compliment is being made fun of in a movie, they took it as a negative and switched everything.

105,Katie F.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",78,8,,4.0,2012-03-09,"Had the $20 for two people deal (1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert). In my opinion, that's a great deal right there. Upon mid-order I realized the pasta I wanted wasn't on the entree list for the $20 deal. But the waitress totally accommodated me since the entrees were similar. She was super friendly and the food came out hot and delicious. Recommend the Blackened Chicken Alfredo Pasta.  However, I understand other reviewers complaining that the service is slow. Our waitress was great this time, but I have had this same experience, often times when the restaurant was close to empty. And one time, we ordered the hot wings. Don't do that. I'm pretty sure they're frozen to begin with. Other than that, I believe TGIFridays is trying to make a turnaround and you can't beat some of their deals and happy hour prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-laguna-niguel?start=80,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.8320000000000003,2.48

76,shishi s.,"Mission Viejo, CA",6,52,31.0,1.0,2012-07-06,"False Advertising Alert --  This place does NOT honor the 2 for $10 deal as advertised on TV and on their website.   I was at the gym and the TGIF commercial came on, saying that they had a 2 for $10 deal (appetizer, entree or dessert - pick 2 for $10).  Pretty good deal, right? Yea, unless they lure you in with this and then refuse to honor it! And I fell for it like a bunch of other suckers in the restaurant.   THAT SAME DAY, I packed up the whole family and headed down to TGIF that same day.  I ask about the deal, and the waitress says, we don't have that anymore.  I PULLED UP THE TGIF WEBSITE ON MY PHONE, WHERE IT SAYS 2 for $10 AND SHOWED HER.  She responded, we're ""independently owned"" not a ""franchise"" so we don't have the same deals as they advertise on TV and on the website.  I wanted to pound my fist on the table and shout, ""BULLSHIT LADY!!"" but instead I suppressed my rage and responded, ""hmm, interesting... ok then.""  The best part was when another huge group comes in and asks for the 2 for $10 deal, and the waitress tells them the same thing.  Then THEY all pulled out their smartphones and showed her the website!! And they were even more pissed than we were!  I almost felt bad for our server... This place has bad management, but she also should have spoken to the manager about it.  I was so pissed that I got suckered into this, but obviously I didn't want to make a scene or ruin my family's dinner over it.   On top of it all, the food sucked baalllzzz.  The chicken tasted like it had been fried in 2 day old oil, the salad was super tiny for $11.  The pictures in the menu are truly deceiving.   This place is not at all like the TGIF on Anton in Costa Mesa.  That TGIF is much better.  I ordered the exact same salad there, and it was 2x larger, and much more fresh, and the server was much nicer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-laguna-niguel?start=60,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.5960000000000005,2.32

31,Monica D.,"Orange County, CA",751,678,46.0,4.0,2012-08-08,"The thing about TGI Friday's and its constant cycle of reinvention is... it WORKS! Other businesses take note: Friday's taps into its customer base and turns out a quality product. I still remember my first time into a Friday's as a little kid, and I still remember my last Friday's happy hour most recently. Both come up in the annals of my mind as being great experiences. Having a consistent happy hour really speaks volumes. Half off appetizers that come out to be around $4-6... drink specials that reflect current trends... a good solid abundance of cheap beer... and now they even have high quality-low price sliders and fries. Genius! Our server at this location, Kiki, was VERY cool. Poor thing was stretched to her physical limits by the end of our visit, but she (and everyone else, from host/hostess to server to bartender to busboy and everyone else in between) was very warm and welcoming. The FK and I had only two items of note: one, the bar tables are VERY high in comparison to the barrier separating the bar area from the dining area. Thus, we were in constant fear of dropping a ketchup bottle or something on some kid playing with her balloon animal. And two, like I mentioned before, business picked up toward the end, which meant an impossibly long wait for our check.

I signed up for the Stripes card so I always seem to receive some sort of discount. I highly recommend signing up for it if you go often. There are also good deals at happy hour.  I often sit at the bar and most of bartenders/servers there are friendly and polite. Some of my favorite bartenders/servers quit, which is a bummer. When I sit at the bar they are also almost always quick with the refills. They rarely mess up on my orders. It's been a long time since I've had alcohol here, so I can't comment on the quality of the drinks or the prices. My only real complaint is that people sometimes stand near the entrance door and smoke. I wish they would stop that.

77,Rachan S.,"Lake Forest, CA",320,685,1308.0,5.0,2012-10-14,"Fridays Fridays Fridays.. ive been eating ur food since i was little. I like the fact how your food always satisfy me..  Upon deciding on what to eat on a cold friday night, me and my brother ended up coming here..its almost 10pm when we came so it wasnt that crowded or anything. we were seated pretty fast and our server was a really nice and friendly guy..  as usual, we ordered our favorite jack daniels menu.. my brother got the rib and shrimp w/ jack daniels (JD) sauce with fries and sweet potato fries for $21.99 ( ). and i ordered  JD sirloin steak and shrimp with tomato mozzarella salad and mashed potatoes for $22.99 ( ).  the thing about me and my bro when we go to eat steak is that we always switch our meal.. im a seafood person and my bro is a meat person.. so when our meal came, my bro gave me all of his shrimp and i gave him my steak right away. so i got double portions of shrimp and he got double portions of meat. but i did try a bit of both the rib and the steak. the rib was tender and after i mixed it with  JD sauce, nothing can beat the taste.. im not a big fan of rib, yet i really like the taste of this.. yes, it is that good! the shrimp was obviously my favorite, its crispy, tender, and fresh!! as for the steak, my bro wants it medium well, and so it is..  as for myself, i dont really like to eat meat that still have some blood inside.. just looking at the red color makes me scared of eating it.. so i only ate a piece, the piece with the least blood in it. it was was tender and juicy.. but its not my favorite meal of the day for sure.. their sweet potato fries were also pretty good with a hint of sweetness and saltiness mix together.. tomato salad was descent, and the mash potato was yummy and creamy as a dessert, we ordered salted caramel cake with vanilla ice cream for $5.99 ( ). i like the thin pudding layer on the top of the cake, but the cake itself wasnt that good.. i dont think ill get this again the next time i come here. Our total bills turn out to be $31.. its so cheap, why?! coz i have a buy one get one w/ the purchase of 2 beverages coupon.. but because our server is so nice and friendly, we gage him $9 tip (well above 25%) so our total bill for that night was $40. its still pretty cheap and we had a nice meal. definitely gonna come back, espceially when i have that coupon again! PS. They have happy hour after 10m when you get half price for all appetizer.. i might try that next time",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-laguna-niguel?start=60,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.9000000000000004,2.6

96,E T.,"Dana Point, CA",0,18,4.0,2.0,2013-02-03,"I was hungry while shopping at Loemann's and thought I would grab a quick bite at TGIFs .  I had a bad experience at this restaurant several years ago and had not been back until this visit...I gave it a shot because things can change over time.  Sadly, not much has changed. Cigarette smoke wafted from the area near the entrance  door.  Once inside, no one greeted me and I stood waiting for several minutes before someone noticed I was there.  I noticed the manager talking to people at a nearby table, but he didn't make any move to say someone would be with me shortly.  After finally being seated, I began to look at the sticky, tattered menu and waited for 15 minutes before the same person who seated me (not a waitress) came by to take my drink order.  I had to ask her to send my waitress over.  My food came out 15 minutes later.  However, the waitress did not even notice that I had no silverware because I was seated at a table that had not been reset.  The waitress did not come back to see how the food was or ask me if I needed anything.  However, the person that seated me came by and I was able to get silverware and  A-1 sauce.  I picked up the bottle of sauce and realized it was empty and covered with sauce stains...revolting. The food was fine once all the issues were resolved, but I did not enjoy my meal because of my experience.  I should have gone with my gut and driven past. The waitress finally  came by and apologized for the service I received and offered to take something off the bill.  I declined the offer.  She also indicated the manager wanted to speak with me but was on the phone for the moment.  I waited at the table after paying the bill expecting the manager would show up, but he never did.   I hope he reads Yelp reviews because he didn't see fit to come out and address the issues with me in person. Bottom line: Poor service, no enthusiasm by staff for customer service, lack of quality control (tables not reset, condiments empty and or dirty), decent food except vegetables were severely overcooked and mushy. Restaurant deserves 1 star, but gave a courtesy star because most of the food was edible.

My BF and I started with the pretzels.  OMG at first I wast like ""WTF Mate?""  pretzels really?  but they were sooo good.  soft and squishy on the inside with just enough crunch on the outside.  I personally always pick off the salt but thats just me.  the cheese sauce was eh.  but the dough was sooo good.  We then did the 20 for 2 deal.  (I must say im sad that it does not include dessert like at most places) but I had the petite filet with veggies and Parmesan fries.  The fries were NOT worth eating.  Overcooked and hard.  Looked nothing like the pictures :(  no parsley for garnish or anything.  The veggies were good though not over cooked and with just enough crunch left to be appetizing.  The steak was eh.  Slightly over cooked for my med rare and with wayyy too much seasoning.  Texture was more rubbery than anything but thats not the chefs fault just poor quality.   The BF had the bruschetta chicken pasta.  That was actually really good.

130,Luis P.,"Temecula, CA",8,252,20.0,2.0,2013-04-18,"There are two types of customers in this place. One is the drinking, appetizer type, social gathering, that welcomes a lot of noise and watches several screens with the sports of the day, while loud music keeps their energy levels up. Then there is the customer that wants to find a good place to eat, with good value and quality. For the first type T.G.I Friday's is possibly quite good, because you always see them laughing and shouting, happy as clams. For the eaters of this world, this place is in a Rapid Decline. Party of 4 went there yesterday, and I paid over $80 for what turned out to be a very mediocre outing. Food: Nachos $10.99, terribly presented, barely any chips, had to complain-got more, with dry chopped chicken, and barely anything else. On a positive note: jalapeños were fresh. 2 Stars. Flat Bread with Spinach and Tomatos, not too shabby, small for the moola, $7.99. 3.5 Stars. Beer Cheese Hamburger with fries $9.99. Nothing to write home about it, just a run of the mill burger, obviously not their forte! 2.5 Stars. Two Cajun Pasta with Chicken, 2 for $20 menu, a gobbly mess that one of the eater liked and the other started laughing uncontrollably once her plate arrived, did not finish it. 3 Stars. Sizzling Chicken & Shrimp $14.99. The chicken was not chicken, but a highly processed patty, I suppose very efficient for this type of place but lacking the delicious characteristics chicken is known for. The Shrimp smothered in a very cheap tasting marinara sauce, and two mounds of disgusting mashed potatoes, with melted cheese that had hardened to the point of no return on the side, sad spectacle, not recommended to anyone who values their digestion process. 1.5 Stars. Coffee was good, at the tune of $2.59 each. Service was sad but server was very pretty, and we tend to overlook weaknesses a little bit, and after all it was not her fault what was served. This is not a place for quality eating. On the other hand I am sure one can get seriously tipsy knowing the place offers all manners of libations. For Booze, okey. For Food, No! Last ever visit, and strongly point out that the state of food in this area is getting worst, takes a lot of misses to sometimes find a decent place. 2 Stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-laguna-niguel?start=120,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.152,2.92

70,OC Native L.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,50,,1.0,2014-03-31,"Tired, indifferently staffed, expensive, poor quality, overall they don't work for your business. When wait staff is this unaccommodating, it usually means a boss no one one wants to work for, and/or corporate micromanagement. I usually don't hang complaints on the ones who serve the public -- they usually just want to make their customers happy and get good tips. This place is consistently downbeat and unpleasant. They water down their soft drinks, they skimp on portions, their windows are unkempt, the restrooms are in very worn down condition. I think they stopped caring years ago, because it has been like this as long as I can remember.

13,Gene M.,"Vancouver, WA",27,47,53.0,3.0,2014-04-14,"Summary: Food: 3/5 Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: 5/5 The tone for this review was solidified when the food came out and the person asked ""are you ready for your sizzle?"" followed by pouring sizzling sauce on my skillet. The sad little sizzle fizzled after a mere few seconds, setting the ambiance for the uninspiring meal that followed.  I ordered the Sizzling Chicken and Spinach. The meal is fairly small portion with a default Caprese salad side. This dish should be renamed to ""Sad Sizzling Chicken and Uncooked Mushrooms"" because the mushrooms were not cooked. The amount of spinach you get makes me question how this ingredient made it into the name of the dish. I DO NOT recommend this dish.  Wife got the Skillet Shrimp on top of risotto-style rice. Again, the portions were small for the price you pay here, but compared to the chicken dish - this one actually tasted good. Not to mention she got a lot more sizzle and less fizzle. The overall ambiance of this location is pretty nice. Plenty of parking and decent views.  Note: Waitress specified that it's happy hour all day (this was a Sunday) which means 1/2 off appetizers except the Jack Daniels dishes.  Other thoughts: Restroom was filthy. Window sills very dirty. Management, I think you can really improve patron experience by keeping things clean.  Overall: Good location, relaxing and nothing too terrible to complain about.

For the half off deal during happy hour, anything with seafood in it is excluded. For 3 appetizer combo, you can't sub.  I came here for a good deal more than a quality of course other wise why would I ever dine in at TGIF...?! But the whole deal thing isn't worth at all. I got spinach dip flat bread which was undercooked, bread was like un-toasted pop tarts. Barely tasted spinach dip. Chicken strips was the best of what I had. It is Crispy kung pao chicken style pop corn chicken kinda dish. Buffalo wings were whatever. At least wings are not fatty, but thin and crispy, but there's no mini drumsticks at all.

That's a binding contract. At bill time, the prices were different. E) The manager was like ""by CA law I cannot change the price"".

Let me tell you, I love steak, so I was super disappointed when my food (finally) came out and the steak was the size of my fist--and I have small hands! It wasn't cooked the way I wanted it, and it didn't really taste that good overall. The mashed potatoes on the side weren't bad, but the mac n' cheese was awful. It was literally just penne pasta with some shredded cheese melted on top under an overpowering amount of breadcrumbs. There was no sauce. It was literally just cheese melted over pasta. Super disappointing. We got dessert also--I forget the exact name but it was some sort of salted caramel cake... and it was SMALL. I really don't know if the server we had just hated her job or if we were particularly annoying in some way, but I don't think she smiled once the entire meal. Overall, the place is dingy, customer service is practically nonexistent, and the food is tiny and doesn't taste good. Honestly, I feel like this place was such a ripoff because we paid a good amount of money for a tiny portion of food.

42,Mar R.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",2,13,,2.0,2015-07-27,"Went for HH! Drinks were good (Long Island iced tea)... Service terrible....slooooooooow...... Super disappointing nachos - virtually NO CHEESE so had it not been HH, and if they had been full price, I'd have really been bummed.  When we let the server know that we were disappointed, he said if we wanted to pay $.59 we could order them again and for $.59 have extra cheese, I don't know why we should have to pay for extra cheese when they should've just come with some cheese, but we went ahead and agreed to do it just to see, and then they came out and the cheese was there, but it was NOT  melted it was still in a grated fashion spread along the chips... It also turned out to be $.99  when we got the check, I mean not that that's a huge amount of money but it's the whole point that we should not even have to pay for something that we should've gotten originally, these are originally $10 nachos and it's a plate with very few chips and some tasty toppings but come on they should have at least put a little cheese on them!  Also they come with a little bit of sour cream and guacamole, and let me tell you those scoops of that were so minuscule it was like a teaspoon size, ridiculous So not smiling when I say ""cheese""!:( We ordered chicken strips with bourbon sauce, that was tasty, but it was mostly little chunks of breading with very little chicken inside-actually kind of a joke... They were not chicken strips, more like little tiny nuggets of breading with this tasty sauce.... And I would say pass on the potato skins, they're basically deep fried chunks of potato with a little cheese melted on top that have no flavor at all... The place was pretty much empty except for people sitting in the bar area which is where happy hour goes on. They won't let you sit in a more comfortable area just outside of the bar and have the same happy hour prices, even though the place is virtually empty, and I will never understand why corporate America does not understand that by skimping on portions and doing things like not giving any cheese on nachos that they're not going to increase their business, that's WHY the place is NEARLY empty... Places that aren't doing well that decide to give you less and less and less eventually  go under, and I hate to see it because it would be sad, but I think TGI Fridays days maybe numbered unless they turn this around:( Have you ever noticed it's the mom-and-pop places that really give you great portions that have lines out the door? Even some franchise and corporate places do a great job... Like Panini Cafe in Aliso- it's great- but it's not a HH kind of place.... There are many places that have HH though, so I guess I'll keep looking! I really hope this place can pull it together and improve, but I'm afraid that corporate decisions keep them from making really great good portioned dishes and it's killing their business.  It's really gone downhill for years, I used to go and get a very good pasta that came with this incredible garlic bread on the side, and then one day they just quit bringing the bread and said that it no longer came with bread!!!!! Things like that are going to put them under, if they don't go in the opposite direction!!!! I don't get it when people with biz degrees making corporate decisions don't get it and cannot see the problem and make reverse decisions!  My degrees are not in business, but I know people, I know how to sell, I know about selling units and pricing and have to say- the folks making decisions at TGI Fridays are blowing it big time!!!

115,Kent D.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,3,,1.0,2015-10-01,"Worst eating experience i have ever had. My wife and I went with a couple that we hadn't seen in years. . We asked to be seated away from the bar to eliminate as much of the crowd noise as possible, and were told ""NO"". After being seated right next to the bar, we were handed menus and given "" PLENTY OF TIME"" to decide on dinner choices. As we started to order the waitress informed us that only ""ONE"" couple could order the ""TWO FOR TWENTY"" dinner special. TGIF'S, according to her only allows one promotional dinner per table. WHAT A JOKE! So, what they are really saying,is, ""WE DON'T EVERYONE TO HAVE WHAT THEY WANT TO EAT, ONLY THE PERSON OR COUPLE THAT WINS THE ARGUMENT ON WHO GETS THE PROMOTION"". After being embarrassed and sorry we picked TGIF'S to bring our friends to eat, we conceded to let them have the special and my wife and I ordered choices we really didn't want. When the order of chips and salsa that came with the "" TWO FOR TWENTY"" dinner, was set on the table, we all looked at each other and began laughing! We counted the chips that were sent to be an appetizer for two people and there were exactly 32 chips on the platter! We flagged down the waitress and quizzed her on the chip dilemma and asked if they refill the chips? Again the answer was ""NO""! UNBELIEVABLE! When the meals were delivered to the table, my french fries were cold! I summoned the waitress over and complained about the cold fries. She actually had to ask if i wanted her to bring me some hot fries! i answered ""YES"", of which never arrived before we were all completed with dinner. I asked to speak to the manager and after a few minutes a ""VERY YOUNG GIRL"", arrived at the table, and without introducing herself, said ""YOU ASKED FOR ME?"", not may i help you or anything cordial. I proceeded to explain everything that had happened and why we were so disappointed in TGIF'S policies and this locations terrible service. With a very condescending attitude, she stood there as if i were making all of this up. ""SORRY"" she said and started to walk away. i called her back and asked her if she even cared about customer service, and her answer was, "" MY HANDS ARE TIED AND I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT POLICY"". I said what about the table preference denied? What about the cold fries that never came? What about 32 chips on the platter? Again, the word""SORRY"" is all i got. She as much as said to me "" IF YOU WEREN'T HAPPY WITH US OR OUR SERVICE, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE FROM NOW ON""! That is exactly what we will do. I will also let anybody and everybody i see and talk to about TGIF'S lack of concern for customer service. I know not everything goes perfect every time you go out to eat, but, it is how the restaurant or the manager handles the problem on what makes a restaurant a place you want to go back too. Her condescending attitude and smirk on her face told me ""I DON'T MATTER""!

The food and drinks are very good, otherwise it'd probably get 2 stars, so compliments to the cooks.  The service however, wasn't so great.  We walked in and the hostess was MIA, when we were starting to second guess ourselves and wonder if we should grab menus and seat ourselves another employee greeted us and found the hostess for us. It's Friday night and the hostess isn't prompt at the door? No good. Then we had a friendly young waiter begin our service and take our orders and bring us drinks. 15 minutes later we hadn't seen our server or our appetizer. A friendly waitress approached us and let us know our food would be right out and she'd be taking over our table. We let her know we had ordered an appetizer and she checked and it had never been put in. So eventually we get our appetizer, potato skins, which of course were delicious. Later on our waitress noticed my boyfriend was low on his iced tea and asked, ""More tea?"" He said yes. He takes a large drink of it and I look at his face. It was a sweetened, raspberry iced tea - he's diabetic.  As a restaurant manager I'm not sure why someone wouldn't clarify if they were confused on the drink before they served it. They comped our potato skins but that's it. Not sure there was a manager on site or not but I would've expected at least the iced tea also be taken off, if not just 20% taken off the whole bill.

38,Tamara C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1,40,,3.0,2015-10-29,"My friend and I wanted to hang out and when we hang out we usually get some grub.  I had a hard time deciding on a place, but with much deliberation and tummies grumbling we chose this place since we hadn't been here in years.   The first thing I remembered when stepping in was at how loud it is.   The next thing was when we looked at our menus how EXPENSIVE it became.  This to me was a SUPER SHOCKER because I just don't think of Friday's food being that much of a WOW factor.   That being said, my friend and I weren't terribly hungry so we split an Apple Harvest Chicken Salad with the dressing on the side. (FYI - NO CHARGE for splitting items)  Now, I'm not a big fan of dressing so I asked for Olive Oil and Balsamic because I like my salads with a tiny bit of flavor.  (They DID NOT have Extra Virgin Olive Oil) and only had a Canola Olive Oil Blend.   OK, maybe I'm ignorant, but I don't know of any other restaurant that doesn't have pure Olive Oil and was quite disappointed by it.  So, I opted for squeezing the rest of my lemon from my water on my salad.   The salad was only OK - NO WOW factor and it was just meh.  The portion size to the price of the salad was not equal and nothing to write home about.  (In my mind I was thinking - I've actually been to fast food restaurants where the salad is bigger, better tasting and a much better price).     At least our waitress was super nice and attentive throughout our whole dining experience. Hence, the three stars. We were debating on dessert, but the devils on our shoulders told us to go for it.  We orderd the Brownie Sensation and I have to say it was the STAR of the show.  Rich, decadent and down right satisfying.   Would I come back here?

18,Kris L.,"San Clemente, CA",6,39,41.0,1.0,2015-12-20,"Momma always said, ""If you can't say something nice, then don't say anything at all.""  If mom was right then Yelp would only have 4 and 5 star reviews.   I have discovered that there are generally only two types of restaurants which inspire an immediate review.  One of these is that wonderful experience you want to share because you really want the proprietor to succeed.  THIS IS NOT THAT REVIEW! This is the kind of review that is a lot like that 10 MPH sign ahead of a sharp curve.  Just don't do it without caution.  Is some of it personal preference?  Sure, all reviews are.  Is some of it meant to wake up the owner and management?  Well, yes...but let's be honest here, TGI Friday's is a big chain that has taken years to suck this hard and must have had to endure and neglect many other genuine attempts by well-meaning critics.  You can't sink to this level of brass-handled, 1980's motif where grandma's cabin's faux Tiffany lamps are stuffed into an aged split level dining cube staffed by well-meaning teenagers, without possessing a certain disdain for your clientele.  Add in the three loud drunks at the bar watching the ball game and you begin to get an accurate picture the place. Where shall I begin?  I arrived on a Sunday at what one could rationally consider ""brunch hour"" only to be admonished with ""we don't serve breakfast here"" coupled with a side of indifference.  Quickly adjusting to lunch back-up mode I politely ask if there is some way I could possibly rather get a 1/2 sandwich/soup combo.  ""NO!  We don't do that either"".  ""Well alrighty then.  how about a soup/salad combo since I see you have both soup and salads on the menu?"", I asked.  ""No, we don't do those combos except of Mondays and Fridays"", was the rapid reply.  Confused, I simply ordered a chicken caesar salad from the coffee table sized book titled ""Menu"". It should be noted that the menu resembles one of those fancy cards at the Hallmark store which has the pop-outs in it along with all the neat things to look at.  This is just the type of thing which should remind you of the dining maxim: ""Never trust a restaurant that tries to do everything.  You will find that they do nothing well."" Why did I come here?  Why, oh why when I had resolved almost two decades ago after  a few crappy experiences that this place and I should never be alone together in a dark alley?  Perhaps it is because I recently moved into the neighborhood and in a moment of Sunday morning hunger-weakness I succumbed.  Yes, against my better judgment I decided to give Fridays another chance.  Has that type of thinking EVER worked out? The food?  Generic crap on every level!  A soupy thrown-together chicken Caesar drowning in mock Caesar dressing.  When I asked for fresh cracked pepper my waitress left for a few minutes and then returned to the table with a standard pepper shaker from another nearby table.  I let it go realizing that this was just not meant to be.  I left my $15 on the table for my paltry salad and water and tucked my tail silently between my legs and headed out the door from the 1980's time travel back experience and returned to the world of late 2015.  There was sunshine and cool air and I could breathe once again.  As I walked out I noticed a sign on the wall asking if everything was ok and if not to take a survey that was attached to the bottom of the bill.  I returned to the table to get that survey only to find the receipt had no such place available.  Defeat and disappointment were once again the strongest flavors served up at this aged eatery. If you think about it for more than a second, It does beg a question, doesn't it?  If you post a sign asking for disappointed clients to speak to the management or leave their concerns, isn't this a tacit admission that you know you're disappointing your customers and that you actually ACCEPT it?   Move over Denny's, there's an old kid in town and you're gonna have to fight pretty hard to keep the suck-fest crown. Friday's, are you listening?  Do you even care?  Let's say it together...""NOPE!""  Here's to wishing you a quick and speedy bankruptcy.  Please go away and make room for a real dining establishment, one which actually cares, PLEASE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-laguna-niguel,2.4,2.67,2.67,,2.5620000000000003
34,Frank M.,"San Clemente, CA",1,12,,1.0,2015-12-21,"My wife and I have been customers since the early 70's at TGI Fridays.  In my business and personal life surely I have spent more than $20K in their stores.  But that has come to an end.  The store in Laguna Niguel has been going down the tubes for many years, as evindenced by hardly any customers on two Saturday Nights.   The final insult to us has been visiting this location two out of the last three weekends. Upon entering the restaurant in Laguna Niguel on Saturday evenings both times we encountered the same hostess.  The first time it was extremely cold outside and walking into the store it was also cold.  She immediately takes us over to the area just to the left of the front door by the windows.  I said ""we would rather not sit here, it's too cold, could you put us up past the bar, where it is warmer"".  She proceeds to tell me that because of staffing we would have to be sitted in this area.   We were mortified.  She parks us next to a large and loud party group that was out of control.  Who would park a 60 year old couple next to a loud obnoxious group, when they specifically asked to sit somewhere else.   This past Saturday we entered the restaurant to be greeted by the same hostess.  She tried to seat us in the same place again and I complained and insisted on another spot.  She now takes us to the right in basically the same area but the opposite side as before.  The only person in that area was a guy with a bucket cleaning the floors next to where we were seated.  We were horrified and left.  I came back in to talk to the Manager, she finally came out from the back after waiting at least ten minutes and me asking two different people to get her.  She barely said anything, did say ""sorry"" but was completely disinterested in what I had to say.  She basically just blew me off.  Shame on TGI.. what a pitiful disgrace to your former self... I can't wait until this location changes hands. Hope it is TGINF.  Thank Goodness it's Not Fridays!!! Good-bye!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-laguna-niguel?start=20,2.4,2.66,2.66,,2.556

35,Elizabeth K.,"Macon, GA",0,4,2.0,1.0,2016-01-10,"The experience was sub par to begin with, but did not improve over the course of the meal. We don't usually go to chains, but we had never been to this restaurant and thought we would give it a chance. The host was polite and welcoming. However, while we were waiting for someone to greet us and take drink orders at our table he, two other employees were talking loudly with each other about the table that had just left and were commenting on the lady being fat and stated she had a ""FUPA"" which I found to be very offensive. I ignored the comment and proceeded to choose a salad and appetizer from a menu they had on the back page with special pricing. The server was in training and we were very understanding of his timing and nerves. However, his trainer, Lacy, was not really training him very well. My husband and I are both in hospitality management and felt bad for the guy in training. The food was not very good, but edible. We laughed that we would check that chain off the list now. No bid deal. Our check arrived and was incorrect. We were overcharged for the salads. No one could find the manager. The server came out and stated it was policy that he could not correct the charge, but couldn't explain it. We were confused as to why the GM sent a server in training out to explain something that he did not understand himself. Then, Lacey came running out after we explained how discourteous it was that the manager didn't feel it was important to explain our bill and the ""policy"" that no one could explain. Poor management. Let down experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-laguna-niguel?start=20,2.16,2.64,2.64,,2.4480000000000004

One day the restaurants like this along with many, will soon pay for it all. Very soon!!! The owner of this place should be ashamed to serve garbage meats and chickens to the person who is feeding them to keep the place open.one day and soon- all these restaurants serving cheap and terrible and not to mention compromised foods will not see an end to all of this!

It's the law! I've been working with this establishment for well over a year on this issue and am done being nice and accepting their complementary meals. That doesn't fix the issue at hand. Finally just filed a complaint with the US Department of Justice. Americans with Disabilities Act is the law and this TGIF is out of compliance therefore breaking the law. It's time for a remodel or close your doors. On a positive not the general manager Kurt is very nice and as accommodating as possible. This issue is out of his hands.

We told our server. Then we ordered Coors Light draft and there was black stuff floating around in our drinks. It might have been mold. Our server didn't seem to know. Bottled beer was our next choice.  We wanted to order the new beef tostadas on the all you can eat appetizer menu but they were out of it. Keep in mind that we were there at 3:00. What we did order was good but it was slow to be served.  We tried to watch a basketball game but they did not get that channel.  If we weren't hungry, we would have left. Not sure we will be back after this experience. I'm still not sure after asking if there was mold in our beer why a manager didn't come by to explain what it was.

There were no restaurants that were open in the area, so to find this place was a Godsend! They were able to seat our large party of 15 right away, which was great and impressive because they were busy. Seeing as though they were the only restaurant in the area open, I can see why they would be so busy.  Although they were busy, that did not stop them from giving us excellent service, and to a group of 15 that isn't always easy.  I am always a fan of TGI Fridays. I have been eating here for 20 years. Hence the four instead of five stars. The menu could really use an update. Of course I enjoy their Jack Daniels menu, so please don't get rid of that, however, adding some new and unique items wouldn't hurt. Dine or Dash? If I am in the area, I will Dine.
