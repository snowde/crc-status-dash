25,Irene V.,"Holtsville, NY",944,352,2742.0,3.0,2012-08-06,"I've been here three times. Well, two, as the last time we left the bar area after being ignored by the bartender for over 10 minutes (even though there were only 8 other people there - fodder for a different review). Unfortunately, there is a theme about eating at a chain restaurant in a mall setting: mediocre service. Although promptly greeted by the hostess at 5pm and seated (and informed of the soup of the day) it took roughly 10 minutes for our server (Greg, I think) to stop by our table. A very, very nice guy who unfortunately appeared to have too many tables. We were there f-o-r-e-v-e-r (6:15)...to the point where I finally got up and asked for the check and a manager. (Who, as a side note, is incredibly, deliciously cute!) Anyway, it's a shame as the food and drink was not what I expected from a chain restaurant. I had a cherry wheat draft beer (yum!) and a 2-for-$10 deal (1 appetizer and 1 entree) of a black bean cheese dip (so good) and korean tacos (I uploaded a picture). The tacos were a good sized portion, had a kick to them and really were prepared quite well. I was bummed as I would have liked a glass of water, another beer and the opportunity to order a dessert to go. When I raised the service issue it was promptly (I mean immediately) addressed. I spoke to the hostess and the manager was at our table within two minutes. The person who dropped off my meal was great in getting a to go container for my appetizer. (Super quick). Perhaps try going at a non-peak hour for better service? Great food for great prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lake-grove?start=20,1.7720000000000002,1.7720000000000002,1.7720000000000002,1.7720000000000002,1.7720000000000002

Decided to just order a few drinks and appetizers since the tables around me seemed to be waiting on there meals. After 15 minutes the waitress came by, we placed our orders. The appetizer came out ""Loaded Chips/nachos"" looked more like the bare minimum. 25 mins later the beer came out, all of the wrong beer? This place needs an experienced manager and maybe a visit from the department of health.

30,Michael P.,"Port Jefferson, NY",64,333,25.0,1.0,2013-03-31,"Those of you that read my reviews will know that I generally do not review chain restaurants or like casual sit down places.  However, I have a secret.  When it is after 10 PM and I am looking for somewhere to eat I will occasionally hit up Fridays as most other places are closed.  I have friends that work at Fridays, and also used to know the bartenders at Lake Grove pretty well. Out of the terrible casual sit down restaurants I found that Fridays was the lesser of evils.  They had some interesting menu choices, their drinks were really strong, and they had good deals on the pick two combos.   Now that has all changed.  I ordered a Long Island Iced Tea ($10) and it was so weak the alcohol was barely detectable.  The manager after she apologized for bringing out the soup 30 mins after we ordered it actually asked me how the drink was.  I am generally not one to complain but since she asked I obliged!  She told me that they are skilled at making drinks so the alcohol cannot be tasted as well. Bwhahahahaha look I know a good Long Island iced tea does hide the fact that it is probably 80% spirits but it does not taste like water!  One thing I know about is drinking! and they water down their $10 drinks. And now the 2 for deal sucks.  every time the limit it down more.  Now it is really not much more of a better deal than buying the ""entree"" (which now is limited to things that can barely be called that) and the appetizer a la carte. Then the food finally came out pretty cold since nobody bothers to expedite the food when it is done.  Our waiter had a corny zinger for every single thing he said.  He could have been Bob Sagat on America's funniest home videos circa 1992.  I was not sure if he was actually trying to be funny or if he was doing an office space impersonation.  If he was doing the later, well played and sorry! Overall no reason really to go there anymore.  If it is  after 10PM do yourself a favor and hit up White Castle!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lake-grove?start=20,1.604,1.604,1.604,1.604,1.604

Dinner is a bit crowded for me at Fridays, but that's to be expected. The burger is usually nice and juicy. The french fries are wonderful. Service was good: the hosts/hostesses are quite kind, and the service was relatively fast. If you want to access WiFi (to do important things, like catch up on work or check Facebook), you're out of luck. 3G Service at Fridays is also pretty limited (at least, if you have Sprint).

Ordered a bacon cheeseburger was given something totally different.  Staff was not familiar with the menu and ran around like a chicken without a head dropping the silverware on the table and hurrying off. When I asked for a decaffeinated beverage I was told they did not have any.  I told them that sprite had no caffeine in it but they were not aware of that fact.  The food was marginal at best.  Asked for  salad with french dressing was told they don't have french dressing.  The salad was not crisp and the thousand island dressing was insufficient. McDonald's has better food and service.  I do not recommend going to this restaurant. There is nothing less that one star to rate this restaurant. Needless to say I will not be returning.

We ordered our food, and it was brought to our table in a timely manner. I ordered a well done steak, as I always like my steak cooked that way, but it really was TOO well done, burned to a crisp.  I did not bother to send it back.  The waitress was pleasant, but everything else was definitely less than average.

Over the past year or so, everytime I go to this place I'm disappointed. So disappointed, in fact, I'm just gonna stop going indefinitely. It's not just one thing, either; it's everything about the place.  The food is substandard, which is mostly just the way it's prepared (sitting on the table for a while, sloppy presentation).  The service hasn't been terrible, but nothing great.  The bathrooms... Let me tell you about this places bathrooms. They're disgusting. You can just tell that no one cleans them until closing time. Plus, they're always freezing and the faucet water doesn't get hot either. I'm sure most of it has to do with the management, but at this point it's really just a reflection on TGI Friday's as a company. This is at least the third TGI Fridays I've gone to on Long Island that I've been disappointed with. I strongly recommend you don't waste your money at this place.

We waited an hour to be seated when we were told it would only be a half hour, the employee they sent to fetch us from the bar never did, as per the hostess. Our server treated us more poorly than everyone else in her section; she never asked us once if there was anything we needed just to check up on us, and never brought me the water I asked for with dessert. The savior of the evening and only good thing about my experience was the food-it was to die for. We ordered Jack Daniels sesame chicken strips for the appetizer, and for my entree I had a sirloin over a bed of steamed vegetables, mainly spinach, balsamic glazed onions, and mushrooms, and on the side a mozzarella and tomato salad.

As we are heading to leave the young lady who sat us asked "" Are you leaving""? she wasn't concerned that they lost a sale, she just wanted to clean the table asap.   I would have liked to have tried the Pretzels with Beer cheese sauce and a few other things.  However, I feel like that place has trained the employee's that they don't have to make the customer happy or even talk to them.  20 minutes of watching them walk around, not busy and the manager did the same.  Glad he is NERDY enough to fix the computer but not the service of the establishment.  Hope you guys have better luck!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lake-grove?start=20,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002

Awesome service by both our server and hostess. Our server was very attentive, checking in on us often and was friendly and amiable. Several in our party got one of the appetizer deals and our server was upfront and told us before ordering that it's not combinable with any other offer or coupon. He also told us about how splitting checks for a party of our size is difficult and often overwhelms the register and frequently can't be done.  I think we all really appreciated the server's honesty; it can be annoying when a server tells you after the fact.  Someone in our party requested a ""girly fruity"" drink and he made the recommendation of this pretty drink that came with cotton candy. I didn't try it but my friend said that she really enjoyed it.  Food was ok, I think it's what is to be expected of a chain restaurant. I had the veggie burger with avocado. It wasn't the most amazing I've ever had but I'm glad there was a veggie option. Others really seemed to enjoy their food.

So...we left. We all got together at Cheesecake Factory, now a party of 28. Middle finger up to THIS TGI Friday's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lake-grove,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88
3,Jason C.,"Long Beach, NY",788,263,2534.0,4.0,2017-01-28,"Really not sure why the low ratings from some fellow Yelpers?!  I have to be honest. I'm not a big TGIFridays fan.  Haven't been to one of these establishment in ages...Years! So since we were in the mall , I said - why not?!  Service was great. Our waitress was very friendly. She frequently stopped by the table to make sure we were happy.  Every time I turned around she was working her station , I'm sure you all have been out to eat enough to witness that the server is never around. No complaints at all with our waitress.   The food? I really can not believe how much the food has improved. Pretzel sticks- amazing! Burgers- juicy as a MoFo & Oreo Madness- Bangin' !! The food all seems fresh , true to flavor and just down right- GOOD! Bar & atmosphere- you typical fun, loud, festive TGIFridays environment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lake-grove,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92

Friday's is not a place I normally frequent, I prefer their competitors but I do feel they have pretty good food. Today I tried the endless apps deal. I couldn't believe this was real. I'm late..I know!! Our waitress was patient and super helpful. She let me know that as soon as the plate hits the table you can order your next meal. It was wonderful. You can't beat this deal for $10. I was very happy. This location in the mall is usually not busy so they have attentive wait staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lake-grove,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96
19,Lucey M.,"Deer Park, NY",0,43,,2.0,2017-03-16,"Don't judge Fridays by this one because for some reason beyond my comprehension they can not find a manager that has the ability to run the restaurant correctly. Customers do not want to hear that the chef is not there on Sunday evenings, get a chef to cover for the primadonna. Over cooked Salmon is not acceptable, overcooked burgers when you request Rare in unacceptable. I'm surprised this location stays open. If you like Fridays I recommend Fridays on Ocean Avenue in Farmingville, they do Fridays right!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lake-grove,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
6,Tianna S.,"Lake Grove, NY",161,89,2104.0,3.0,2017-03-17,I enjoy coming to this location but whenever I get the waiter Alison I regret coming. I don't know if it's the waiter or if they are just understaffed but I never seem to see my waiter when I come to this location and the service just isn't good making me not wanna come back. The main reason I come here is because of the mobile app I have that gives me a lot of cool deals like 20% off my meal and I also love the endless appetizer deals. Without the app I would give this establishment two stars. They need to come out with new menu options and they also should get more staff or just better staff overall.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lake-grove,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
10,Nishat H.,"New York, NY",187,21,334.0,1.0,2017-04-06,Typical American fast-casual chain restaurant situated in a mall with an unkempt appearance + slow service. The whole restaurant had a mildew smell to it. Diners were mostly large families and loud teenage groups. I really don't understand the endless appetizers hype (how many greasy chicken wings soaked in buffalo sauce can you possibly eat?). Highlight of my experience was the aesthetic chicken sandwich picture I took :-).,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lake-grove,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0

Told we can't use a coupon unless we buy a drink which is written no where on the coupon, then told we could get a free app. The bill comes, it wasn't free. It was 8 dollars off an app. Fine if that's the deal but at least tell us? Ordered a jack Daniels chicken sandwich - no jack daniels sauce . Asked for it on the side after the waiter came back , ""sure"" - he never brought it over. It's always something here.

1,Matt S.,"Centereach, NY",2,13,,1.0,2017-09-20,"I decided to look past the uncomfortable, flattened seats, mildew smell, and curious fact that there were barely a few people in the restaurant while Applebee's and Miller's both had 45+ minute waits. The server neglected to co,d back for long stretches of time, brought an incorrect drink. Brought a salad without chicken when chicken was ordered, didn't bring the chicken until after everyone finished their meals, and then charged for it. After my card was swiped the server and manager tried to explain that their credit card machine is down and they could not receive payment, but my card was charged... that they needed to charge me again and I'd ged a rerun within a week.  All very insane and confusing. Submitted a complaint to the company online, received an email two days later stating corporate received notice from store management that the issue has been handled and resolved, case closed. Not a single person spoke to me, at all, about anything, and corporate tells me management said they did and fixed everything.  Ridiculous. This store should be closed down.  It's the only place in the mall that never has more than three people and for good reason. Food tastes bland, beer list is behind the times, environment is garbage.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lake-grove,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96

Very good server bravo. Otherwise, we sat around 6:10 and didn't get our food till 6:55. There was barely any food coming out of the kitchen so something is wrong with that. If the food came quicker the whole experience would've been much better. Otherwise, my burger was supposed to have onion rings on it, there was two tiny pieces. But, I ordered my burger medium well and it came out well which was fine. Fries were seasoned well. I like fridays but wouldn't recommend this location to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lake-grove,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
