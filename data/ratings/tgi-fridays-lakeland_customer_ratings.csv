2,Gary H.,"Lakeland, FL",19,121,170.0,1.0,2012-11-04,I went to tgi  on sun to watch the game. Omg. Yes the game wS on. But. Me and  two friends ordered food I got a salad.  When it came out it had a live roach in it. No joke. When I talked to the manger about this. She comped our food. But by the time we left. I got a bill for 60 dollars.  I was flord   Yes we paid it and have the Waitress $30 tip she then proceeded to bitch and complain about it. I will never go to this place again. Also I had went ther two weeks prior to this and got food to go it was Horrible I ordered chicken Caesar salad and Jack Daniels sampler my salad was put in with the hot food and the chicken was burnt to a Crisp.  Never again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lakeland,,,,,

However the appetizers were off the charts and filling so I wasn't that hungry. Not sure why the bar runs different drinks prices (cheaper) than when you sit down? They often run promotions and coupons that you can get on your phone - so well worth searching for them on your smart phone while you wait for a table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lakeland,,,,,
