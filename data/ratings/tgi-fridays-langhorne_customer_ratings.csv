25,eleck T.,"Winterville, NC",0,93,,2.0,2012-10-22,"truthfully, I don't get corporate chains like Fridays. They aren't a good restaurant and they aren't a good sports bar. They have right-sized portions, which means you should appreciate getting less food. It is the same bar food that you can get at many of the chains. You get better burgers at some burger places. You get better pasta at pizza/pasta places. You get more sports and drinks at a sports bar. Yet the place is crowded mostly with young folks who will wait an hour for a table. I guess being mediocre make you unobjectionable. So when you try to decide where to go, everyone finds something they can eat or drink, even if it is low level satisfaction.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-langhorne?start=40,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006
39,Megan L.,"Menlo Park, CA",132,240,202.0,2.0,2013-03-30,"Scraping the bottom of the barrel here.  I was on a business trip and was tired, unfamiliar with the area, and it was dark. I have a hard time finding my way around the odd suburban sprawl of the east coast (nothing is close enough to actually walk but things are too dense to leave any open space for enjoyment). I finally pulled into TGI Fridays for some dinner so I could get back to my hotel. The hostess was prompt at greeting me and showing me to a table. The restaurant is what you'd expect, I guess, of a chain like this. A mix of tables and booths, a bar to one side, teenage wait staff. The music was playing loudly enough to give you a headache and the menus featured lots of big photos of unhealthy food and mixed fruity drinks. I got a salad and a side of fries. The food was fine - fairly ordinary but nothing to complain about. Overall the menu is uninspired but then if you go to TGI Fridays, you're not going for the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-langhorne?start=20,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006

She had an unenthusiastic attitude! We go there around 8:30, and felt rushed to eat. We sat down  and were handed our menus. About 2 seconds later the waitress asked if we were ready to order. I didn't even have time to pick up the menu. She came back 2 times within a five minute span, and asked us if we were ready to order! After we ordered, our food arrived hot in a timely manner. A definite plus!! As far as the food quality goes, it was poor. I felt that my dish, the brushetta chicken pasta( which is my go-to dish at Fridays) was terrible. There wasn't nearly enough cheese, or balsamic on the dish. Also, they must use a new kind of tomato sauce because the dish seemed spicier and had a bigger tomato taste. I did not enjoy this.  Healthy Choice makes a better version of this dish. Then came dessert, We ordered and the check came before we ate. We thought this was an unusual time to bring the check.

34,Matt N.,"Fairless Hills, PA",1,25,14.0,2.0,2014-08-06,"What can one say about an outdated model of a chain restaurant?  There was a time that TGI Fridays was a hip place to visit, but that time has long since passed. The joint just seems to be stale amongst an ocean of other mediocre corporate Americana restaurants.   I believe that public tastes have changed since the 90's and ""we"" regular folk expect a more intimate approach when it comes to food. However, TGI Fridays seem to still embrace the philosophy of frozen flash fried food as being what we deserve. Shame on them. I recently read in the business section of the newspaper that TGIF is now offering endless appetizers as a special and it dumbfounded me. For a struggling chain to now offer basically free food, while struggling financially makes no business sense to me. From my limited business sensibilities, it appears that the CEO has non-existent business acumen.. While I don't dismiss chain restaurants whole hardheartedly, this is one chain that I would not be sad to see go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-langhorne?start=20,2.536,2.536,2.536,2.536,2.536

I was expecting mediocre or ok at best. But this Friday's sets them self apart, even from thief playing, I was pleasantly shocked! I feel like every other Friday's in a 50mile radius should come here to see how it's done, from the bartenders to the waitstaff and especially the cooks.  I ordered off of the gluten free menu.. Opted for the ribeye, so happy with that selection, while eating u couldn't tell me I wasn't at a steakhouse, the seasoning was perfect, freaking perfect. I normally order a vanilla bean cheesecake because I never finish my food and is the only highlight of the meal (when they do it correctly).

Of course they would put it anyway because they always do.  When it arrive I opened the container to find my dessert without the chocolate sauce, what??? Omg my eyes watered...

Not very busy and we are seated right away. Here's where I get confused.  My friend ordered the Cobb Salad with chicken and I order the Cobb salad with the ""blackened Ahi Tuna"".  Here is the conversation that follows: Me:  ""Can you please cook the tuna all the way through?"" Waiter: ""oh we can't do that, I've already asked in the past and the chef won't do it"" Me: ""you can't just keep the tuna on the grill for a couple extra minutes? Waiter: ""no because we have a specific recipe we follow and we can't change the recipe to order"" Me: ""but...I don't understand...nothing is changing..."" Waiter: ""yeah sorry. The chef Sears the tuna for only a couple seconds on each side. He won't keep it on longer."" Ok then.  Fast forward to the meal... I ended up getting the salmon, which was actually pretty good, but was the only enjoyable part of the salad.  The avocado slices it came with were barely enough to make a tablespoon and the Avocado vinegarette  was very...bitter?   There just wasn't enough to the salad.  No flavor, no pizzazz.  But I guess it was typical TGIF fare.  I wouldn't go back. I just don't understand why the waiter wouldn't even ask the chef to cook the fish longer.  I've gotten tuna ""cooked through"" at every other restaurant I've ever ordered it at, as long as I've asked...to state that the recipe couldn't be ""changed"" just doesn't make sense.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-langhorne?start=20,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005

Luckily there's ""copycat"" recipes on Pinterest so I can re-create the original recipe on my own. I see they changed one of the other things I liked on their menu, the Chicken Fingers. I'll be back to try them. As for the Chicken I had tonight... never again. Even the chicken had a weird consistency of rubber and tough, bark-like skin. My stomach was gurgling before the check came.

My usuals are most of their salads - love the Cobb with salmon. My daughter loves their ribs. Mostly everyone loves their jack Daniels flavored stuff.  One extreme bonus is their drink specials.

Many of the area chains lure the locals in with discount coupons in the newspapers and shopping fliers. Friday's coupons are somewhat of a rarity, but one (a BOGO that required the purchase of two beverages) crossed our path weeks ago and we stuck it in the bucket for consideration on one of those nights when work and errands run late. We ordered adult drinks:  the IPA choice on draft was very nice and husband's rum and coke didn't stint on the rum. Husband's entree was a sirloin steak with Jack Daniels sauce; mine was short ribs in the same sauce. Both came with a lemon-flavored broccoli side and an order of mashed potatoes, plus deep fried skinny onions (most of which I turned over to my fried food-loving husband who burns up those extra calories better than I do). Husband substituted French fries for his mashed potatoes. Overall, the meal was better than expected, if heavy on the fat content. The short ribs were so tender they could be cut with a fork and the sides were good. The sauce on both entrees was sweet. Regarding the sauce: Husband says ""yum!"" Me: ""gaaah."" I suppose it could have been worse (i.e. sweeter). To me, sweet sauces overpower the palate and lack dimension. The ribs were cooked to perfection, though. Had they worn a good savory sauce, they really would have won me over.  I liked the decor of this Fridays with its earth tones,  warm subdued lighting, and Mission straight lines. It is a nice place to relax over a drink. Glad we stopped in to test the waters. I wouldn't repeat a dish with the Jack Daniels sauce on a future visit - though my husband certainly would.

2,Jarrett F.,"Ithaca, NY",96,90,92.0,4.0,2016-12-11,"Been to this Friday's a few times. The food and service have always been consistently good. Nothing terribly remarkable that makes it stand out from any other Friday's location. But I will say that if you're not familiar, Friday's is probably one of my favorite of chains in this sort of caliber range. The boneless wings are amazing and addicting, and I could easily sit and eat four plates of them. Big fan of some of the drinks too, there's a berry mojito that I can't quite remember the name of that's fantastic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-langhorne,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
1,Gerald S.,"Newtown, PA",1012,2191,6425.0,3.0,2016-12-14,"This is the TGI Fridays that is within the campus of Oxford Valley Mall, Langhorne (Middletown), Pa. It has the conventional layout of the older version of this national franchise, with a large bar and booths/tables all around.  The atmosphere is casual and bustling, and has the feel of the roadhouse it was meant to be.  We chose this spot as representative of contemporary popular American cuisine for our friends who had just arrived from Asia. They wanted something traditionally American.  What is better than nachos, burgers, salad, fried chicken and chicken/shrimp combos on top of pasta?   Don't answer that!  We had about a 10 minute wait for seating on a busy Saturday night.  Service was friendly and acceptably prompt given the crowd.  Our server was patient as we perused, translated and sought direction from our guests.  The youngest had no problem finding the fried chicken sandwich.  The mother and grandmother were slower in understanding meals without rice, but ultimately selected a traditional cheeseburger, and a grilled chicken pasta dish.  Of course, there was also the issue about western utensils vs. chopsticks, but we worked through that with the help of the large wooden spikes used to hold things together.  We natives moved more quickly to the salads, sliders and shrimp/chicken plates.  Everything was served together, and I watched as our friends took their first close up look at American food.  It was a cross between confusion and incredulousness. Big pieces. Nothing cut into small bite size morsels. Okay. They would just have to figure it out and dig in.  The rest of us went quickly to work on our Jack Sliders (very good), BBQ chicken salad (plentiful and tasty), chicken/shrimp combo (loved the shrimp, but left most of the chicken to take home). The fried chicken sandwich was devoured with relish.  So far. So good. Our second oldest guest just ate the fries around the burger.  She didn't seem to know where to begin.  I think she did not want to use her hands to pick up her food.  I asked if she would like to exchange a small slider for her half pounder, and she gratefully accepted.  She ate it with the spike holding the entire thing like a burger on a stick.  She liked it.  Her burger was pretty good, but a step below what I have sampled in places like Chilis or Applebees. It was not the medium finish requested, but far closer to well done. Granny was able to eat her pasta with the spike, but seemed tentative the whole way.  It wasn't the noodles she was accustomed to, but she was game.  All in all, it was a fairly good introduction to fast casual, something almost totally lacking in their part of Asia. They were impressed by the size of the crowd, and its diversity.   Welcome to America, sisters!  You aren't in homogenous Asia any more.  You'll love it once you figure it all out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-langhorne,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

And every single time we get amazing food with even better service. Since going to Fridays in Langhorne we haven't had a single bad waiter. I remember one time I was being super picky with my food, haha, and the waitress never gave me a hard time about it and fixed everything I needed fixed. Let's just say she got an amazing tip!

It took over a half hour for a server to come to our table, it was the same in the entire section we sat in. People were getting up and leaving without ordering. After we ordered it took another 45 minutes for food to come, cold. The people at the table asked for their check when we ordered, they still didn't get it when our food came. Oh, by the way, the place wasn't crowded at all, less than half full. We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-langhorne,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
27,Frank A.,"Levittown, PA",1,17,,4.0,2017-03-02,"Glad to see they brought back the endless apps at a reasonable price point ($10/pp).unfortunately they limited the menu. No more fried green beans. They did add some new items, fried pickles and meatballs. Meatballs were good. A suggestion, they need to accommodate single parties who would rather a half order instead of a full order. Who can eat a full order of fried potato skins and anything more? I'd rather a half order so I could order a half order of something else.

We ordered drinks that took 10 minutes to arrive ( nothing from the bar) Our server left without asking us if we were ready to order. 15 minutes later the server returned. At this time we placed our order for apps and our meals. 30 minutes later we still did not have our apps and we all had empty glasses. When we received our app we were not asked if we wanted refills on our empty drinks. When the meal finally did come out it was cold and not all at the same time.

15,Rebecca S.,"Darby, PA",2,66,1.0,1.0,2017-10-29,"I went to this TGIFridays with my husband and a friend. We were in a great mood and were joking around a lot. I ordered a pinot grigio and some apps. After my pinot grigio, I ordered a glass of champagne. We were munching on our apps for a while, and had been there about an hour and a half when the main courses came out. I said ""I think I'll have one more glass of wine with my main entree."" The waitress looked askance and then said ""I don't think I can serve you another drink."" I said ""Excuse me? why not?"" She mumbled something about only being allowed to serve ""two drinks per hour."" I said I had never heard of such a thing. I said ""and I'm not even driving!"" She looked around the table and said ""well who IS driving?"" I said ""my husband!"" He, by the way, had been nursing one beer the entire time we were there, which was a total of over two hours, and he didn't even finish it. She said she would go and check whether or not I was allowed to have another wine. Awhile later she returned with a third champagne (which I didn't want: I was going to switch to a red wine, but since she was arguing with me about the two drinks an hour"" rule and nosing into who would be driving, that she didn't even listen to what kind of drink I actually wanted.) Now mind you, we had been there well over an hour anyway by the time I asked for an additional wine. I am now wondering if she thought we were intoxicated (we absolutely were not) because we were joking around and having a good time. May I also mention that I am 47 years old and my husband and friend are also in their 40s. It's not as if we were a bunch of college kids. We had zero drinks before entering the restaurant and had just come from a movie. I have NEVER heard of any ""two drinks per hour"" rule at any restaurant in my life before. I have never had a problem of any kind ordering wine at a restaurant and I have been eating out at least five times a week for the last 20 years. I would like to know if this is an actual rule or if the waitress was just being exceptionally judgmental. She ruined our afternoon and our good mood. I won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-langhorne,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
14,Julie L.,"Levittown, PA",0,3,,1.0,2017-11-20,"We hadn't been to this Friday's in years, and after this experience, I can't see that we'll ever be back. We walked in on a slow Sunday afternoon, and no one was at the hostess stand. The women who would end up being our server walked past us twice before acknowledging us. When she finally did, she asked us to follow her to our table. Her pants were falling down, and we could plainly see her thong and the top of her butt! This someone who is serving food! That was unappetizing. After bringing us our drinks, she took our orders, then disappeared. We waited nearly 40 minutes for a sandwich and some pasta. Meanwhile, tables around us were filthy with dirty dishes and wadded up napkins of guests that were long gone. Not the server's fault - either a lack of guidance from management or poor staffing, but again, it's pretty unappetizing. When our food finally came, my husband's pasta was cold. We had to wait for our server to appear again, and when he said that his was cold, she seemed surprised. She took it to the manager who came to our table. Ultimately we decided not to get his meal after waiting so long and having to get on our way. The manager was quite apologetic, but there was just some many things wrong with this experience to justify going back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-langhorne,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
