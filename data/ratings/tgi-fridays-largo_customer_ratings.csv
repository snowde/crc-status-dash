130,Shirelle K.,"Washington, DC",12,47,6.0,2.0,2012-01-08,Friendly greeting at the front door....too friendly actually. The hostess said she remembered me from the prior week. Yeah well it was the same me but a different date. It took 20 minutes for our first drink to get to the table. The food got to the table before the drinks and food was ordered 10 minutes later. The waitress kept rolling her eyes and making excuses for why the drinks took so long. The first time was because there was a situation at the bar and police had to put someone in a choke hold. My date said he could see the bar from where we were seated and saw nothing. The excuse for the second round taking so long was the bar had no clean available glasses . When talking to us the waitress would lean with her elbows on the table. The manager stopped at the table to ask if everything was ok. Obviously she did this out of habit and did not really give a ish since we told her NO and complained about the slow unprofessional service and she did nada. As we were eating we were constantly asked if we were done and wanted any of our plates taken. ( I suppose she was not fibbing about the lack of clean available dinnerware cause they kept trying to get ours....lol). Unorganized .....unprofessional ....slow....you get the idea...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-largo?start=120,1.736,1.736,1.736,1.736,1.736
132,Putt P.,"Washington, DC",0,2,,1.0,2012-01-22,"So yesterday 1/22/12 I (along with two others) went to the Boulevard for dinner, we were indecisive about where we wanted to dine but one of us definitely did not want to go to TGI Friday's.  I asked why not, she responded it was ghetto.  But she had never been.  I wanted to go!  We went.  We got the place and stood in line, there was one person before me and while standing in line a couple came in and stood at the podium.  When the hostess came back to the podium, she made herself comfortable (by leaning on the podium) and ask the people that came in behind me their name.  I said that I was here first.  She continued to service them...WHAT!  I gathered my party and let them know we are out.  When Ms. Ghetto is the greeter, it's time to go.  We went to Carolina Kitchen, where the service is always good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-largo?start=120,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000004
134,S B.,"District Heights, MD",92,3,,1.0,2012-06-14,"This was the worst Friday's I've ever gone to.  First off, the server apparently lost something before we sat down and was more concerned with that than greeting us in a timely fashion and without an attitude.  We ordered Mojito's and they were disgusting.  We told the server that the drinks weren't made properly and he told us that they were made with rail rum.  We then showed him the menu which states that they are made with Bacardi.  Later we had appetizers, only 1 came out.  We weren't given any napkins or silverware.  The other appetizer never came out.  We had to ask the bartender for silverware which was dirty.  When the entree's came, we still weren't given clean silverware and had to sit and just look at our food for 5 minutes until someone tracked down our server to get us some silverware.  At the end of the meal, the missing appetizer came.  The waiter told us that the appetizer couldn't be removed from the check.  The manager was uninterested and helping us.  She never even introduced herself as the manager.  We asked the server what her name was and he said ""Tee-Tee""; no one knew what her name was!

48,Kandra G.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",17,54,76.0,1.0,2012-06-20,"PLEASE BE A MAN OR TAKE A MAN WITH YOU WITH YOU IF YOU WANT ANY KIND OF DECENT SERVICE AT THE BAR....BETTER YET, USE THE GAS AND DRIVE TO ANOTHER RESTAURANT!!!  Today a friend and I went there around 1:15pm. There were only 6 people at the bar when we got there (more showed up after us and received service before us). The bartender named Kionna took our drink orders and we only asked for water for the moment. Well that moment ended up lasted us another hour and a half because she NEVER came back to us. I had to yell across the bar to her to order the spinach dip. About 10 minutes later two men came into the bar and not only did she immediately start serving them, but they must have ordered the same thing and she took them their spinach dip BEFORE she brought ours and I had to point out to her that she gave them our food. Well that must have pissed her off because she blantenly ignored us for the rest of our meal. When another server came out with a second dip plate, she just pointed for the server to give it to us, but never looked at us nor said another word to us the rest of our stay. Another bartender who was very busy checking in orders and doing inventory eventually asked if we needed some help because obviously rude azz Kionna never addressed us.  So we ordered from the other bartender in which it was not her job to be serving us and watched as Kionna not only flirted with and served all the men, but served many of them before they even ordered. For example, one man walked in and was looking for an empty seat. By the time he asked me if he could sit next to me, she had already poured his beer and had it sitting there. Then the man NEVER even ordered and she knew what he wanted and put it in the system. Again she never looked our way again, but took ordered from all the men around us. I don't care if you have regulars there or not...respect all of your customers. Because the other bartender was so busy working and not flirting, we didn't get out of there until 2:53. It took us 30 just to get the check!!!! I am thoroughly disgusted with the type of service that Sabrine (the manager) allows for the staff to provide and its sad too because I'm sure she thought that she didn't get a tip because women don't give good tips. Well news flash...women don't give good tips when you don't service us like you service the men. I also want to point out that they have a different menu from the other Fridays in the area and do not have lunch portion sizes. I wish I could comment on this one drink that I saw on the menu called a Pink Punk but for the last time, KIONNA couldn't be bothered to serve us women.

Bar was packed and so was restaurant for 3 pm-ish on a Sunday. Restaurant was out of several items--drinks and food--we inquired about. Service was crazy slow (and unprofessional). Did not receive several items ordered. Food that finally came out of the kitchen was... a huge disappointment.  Best thing on the table was my kid's mandarin oranges. I don't have high expectations from Friday's, but the platter I received of mystery meats with barbecue sauce thrown on top was just nasty.

46,Mattie C.,"Arlington, VA",95,895,91.0,2.0,2012-10-18,"2.5 maybe, but I think rounding down is more accurate than rounding up. Redskins game at FedEx was at 4:15, but we also wanted to watch the 1:00 games, so we metroed out to Largo so we could watch the 1:00 games then walk to FedEx.  This place seemed the most likely place in the BLVD area where we could catch all the games. TVs:  The bar area had enough TVs but had the same two games on most of the TVs - Ravens game and Eagles game.  Those games of course were interesting to watch but there were many others going on and I wish we had been able to see some of those.  Most places with many TVs are trying to show all the games.  Additionally, the TV quality was crappy.  Two out of the six in our line of vision had major issues with the screen resolution.  I also didn't like how they had the volume on one of the TVs super low and blaring music that clashed with it.  They should have turned the music off and turned loud volume for one game, or turned the volume off on the TVs and left the music on. Service:  Service was very slow as our waitress was pretty inattentive.  She never came back to refill drinks, take the menus or clear the dishes and I feel like half of our time was spent looking for her.  I actually interacted with one of the managers and the busboy more than with her.  It took a while to get the managers attention as well and the food took FOREVER. Food:  I very much enjoyed the fried mozzerrella squares, though wish the portion size was bigger.  We also split a pasta dish that I thought was AWFUL.  It had some kind of balsamic vinagrette mixed with marinara type thing that didnt work at ALL.  It was also barely lukewarm when we got it. Bathrooms:  disgusting.  I actually prefer the bathrooms at the stadium to these.  There was a smell, 2/3 toilets were not flushed and there was only one tiny sink area.  When I walked in the sink faucet was on full blast but no one was in there.  What kind of person blasts the sink water and doesn't turn it off?  I wonder how long the sink had been going when I walked in. Price: the only redeeming quality of the place.  They have a lot of reasonably priced items and a great 2 for 1 deal that we took advantage of.  Its a shame that these deals are wasted on ""meh"" food and in a place where the service is so bad that the good prices are not worth the ordeal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-largo?start=100,1.6400000000000001,1.6400000000000001,1.6400000000000001,1.6400000000000001,1.6400000000000003

We were sat quickly which was a plus. Our server had no idea what beers were on special and she stood there trying to guess for a few minutes as she paged through the drink menu. After going to the bar to check she came back with a response. Our appetizer and soup came out almost 20min after ordering it. It was only boneless wings and french onion soup. The food itself was good so no real complaints on that end. The server was not very attentive to the drinks and much of the staff seemed to walk back and forth talking loudly, using profanity and it just seemed very unprofessional. The manager came by our table to ask us how we were doing. Not sure what triggered this, if anything, but it was before the unprofessionalism occurred. We ordered dessert which was good so again, no complaints on the food part.

The service I got was so so. I was totally disappointed when I ordered my Cajun chicken & shrimp pasta and there was a piece of hair in it. The manager of course doesn't give me my food for free but he only takes 50% off & brings me out a fresh pasta. Not to mention that I couldn't use one of my coupons only because two of my co workers got some special they had and I was sitting at the same table with them which the manager says that I can not use it. That was very disappointing. Never the less I didn't enjoy myself and this was my first time going to this Fridays which I told myself I would probably never go because I always hear how bad the service is there.

So my husband and I come in for the 2 for 10 deal. We ask about it and the server shows it to us on the menu. I decide on the bruschetta and the petite sirloin. We order our apps, get them, eat them and wait five minutes for our server who is at another large table who apparently ordered apps, mains and desserts all at once. (Who the hell does that?) When she finally comes back, I tell her my order, and she says ""We are out of it"". I asked for a substitution. She asks her manager and I'm told no. So now I'm stuck with an app that's part of a combo that I'm going to have to pay extra for. I ask for the manager. She offers me something off the 2 for 15.99 combo (which is really the same, there's like 2 things different on it). I decide to do the sizzling chicken and shrimp. I ask her why she will substitute that, but not another steak that was priced 50 cents less on the menu. She didn't have a response to that. A few minutes later she comes back out and asks ""Did you want the sizzling chicken or the sizzling chicken and shrimp?"" ""Do you want the ribs?"" No, if I wanted the ribs, I WOULD HAVE ORDERED THE RIBS., At this point, we've been there for 45 minutes, and I'm done. End up paying 15 bucks for apps that were supposed to be part or a combo and one diet Coke that I got to take all of three sips of. How to fix this? First, when we ask for a special, and it's out of stock, TELL ME. Don't let me sit for all this time after I decided on what I want. I would not have ordered the 2 for 10 if I had known the steak was not available. Second, there was another steak on the menu that had a dollar list price more than the petite sirloin.

51,J W.,"Washington, DC",1,1,,1.0,2014-03-23,"This is my first Yelp review. So here we go: I would have to say that unfortunately every time I attempt to give this place a shot, the service gets incrementally worse. The staff has absolutely no concept of ""service"" or customer respect for that matter. I went to visit on Sunday, March 23, 2014 to get a to-go order.. When I arrived it was difficult to find the to-go station. Finally, the hostess pointed me in the right direction and that's when I went to order my food. When I arrived to the station, the server was clowning around with another customer (appeared to be an employee) attempted to collect his money for his order. After watching this transaction for almost 5 minutes, I then asked if I was in the right place to order take out. That's when the server looked at me and told yes, but she had a line, when there was only me and another woman waiting to order, and proceeded to continue here conversation with the young man she was speaking to. All the long there was another employee standing playing around and in the same conversation completely ignoring me and the woman that was waiting.  Finally, I asked for a menu and that's when she got an attitude, rolled her eyes, and attempted to give me the menu. At that point I said never mind and turned to walk out the door. In my peripheral I saw here throw the menu down and continue her conversation. Needless to say, even though that wasn't the worst service I've had there, that was my last attempt to support that location. Management: PLEASE HIRE STAFF THAT ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT YOUR BOTTOM LINE! STOP HIRING KIDS THAT COULD CARE LESS ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS AND/OR MY PATRONAGE.

Well, my first impression of this Friday's is that they are slow, crowed, and understaffed. Had to wait about an hour (was told 15 to 20) because there weren't enough servers to cover the floor. -1 The shorter of the two hostesses was a ghetto girl with her face turned up as if SHE was the one waiting too long for a table -1; The other was sweeet. When we finally sat down, it took a bit for our server to get to us but in her defense,it was pretty busy. She was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu items- +1 for her. Our food took a while but it was hot and tasty.

I was seated right away but all they had was a table by the bar. This place was so busy and there were clearly a lot of people there for happy hour. My food took way too long to come to my table. My server was slow and he kept forgetting what I asked for.  I was so annoyed because while I'm starving and waiting Im also freezing because the air was blazing ..it felt like Alaska in there.. It was so bad I ended up deciding to leave before my food even came.. I asked him to just put the food in a box and I can take it home. Took him 3 trips in the back to remember the darn box :(.  I ordered spinach artichoke dip & chips as an appetizer. It was warm and delicous.. But the food I ordered was horrible. It was chicken and Cajun shrimp.. I wanted a baked potato.. But he said they don't sell them.. So. I was super disapointed .. And my food was just plain tasteless and bad... When I got to the hotel to sit down and eat I discovered the food was poorly packed in the box.. My fries were soggy and the chicken was bland and cooked too long..

Apparently it must've been ready for awhile because everything was ice cold!! We then asked to speak to a manager and she rolled her eyes and walked away.

33,Miranda W.,"Bowie, MD",33,29,7.0,1.0,2014-12-01,Two words to describe this TGI Friday's: PURE STRUGGLE Look I use to bartend at TGI Fridays and I understand it's not one of the best companies to work for but it all depends on the management at the particular location. But this location is obviously run by Stevie J and Jos-E-Lin Hernandez because of the nonsense I witnessed at this location with the workers (I don't include customer behavior in this because it's TGI Fridays not Ruth's Steakhouse. I expect nothing from them). It took over 10 minutes to get acknowledged at the bar (Hey Slow Sally! There is a different human sitting at the bar [which isn't even busy to being with]). Then she had one hell of an attitude giving me my menu. Then I tried to get her attention three times then gave up and yelled for the gentlemen behind the bar (Maybe having a lady garden will help me this time). He was nice and took my order quickly. Then I saw some random server humping a wall (Someone should tell her Stadiums' hiring) and then another chase a customer that was her friend out while on the clock. Stevie J needs to getting better control of his bus! Anyway when the food came the wings and the Pretzel Sticks were good which almost bumped them up to 2 stars but then I got my Mozzarella sticks and they were dead fucking cold. I could tell it was a mis-order and threw it on my plate and had been sitting there for a while. Since I know all this shit is frozen (Sorry for exposing your secret TGI!) I'm just gonna go home and re-warm them the way they should.  Still love TGI Friday's but not this one. I won't be coming back to this one.

86,Danielle M.,"Temple Hills, MD",49,138,75.0,2.0,2015-03-29,"I went to this Friday's 2 nights ago and had quite possibly the worst restaurant experience I've ever had in my life. It was horrible! And I've been to this location several times before without incident (hence the 2 stars) but this night took the cake for me.  Off the bat the music was so loud that my friend and I couldn't have a normal conversation, we had to scream back and forth at each other and there was a lot of ""huh? What'd you say?"" happening. Were seated after about a 10 minute wait and given menus to look over. The waitress came over within about 5 minutes of us sitting down so that wasn't too bad but after that it went downhill... FAST. I ordered a mango lemonade and my friend a strawberry lemonade. We also put out orders in and I tried to order the pick 2 with spinach dip and cajun shrimp and chicken pasta but the waitress said that pasta had never been an option on the pick 2 menu at that location... LIES! I had been there about a month earlier and ordered that exact combo after going to see 50 shades of grey at the Magic Johnson Theater. I told her that and she continued to dispute with me so I let it go and got the pasta only... A little perturbed. I knew at this point that things wouldn't get any better. My friend still had hope, but I was right.  Since our drinks come from the bar I expected to wait for them for a little while but not for 20 minutes! Yes, it took that long to get our NON-alcoholic drinks. The waitress did not come back that whole time to check on us or offer an explanation. When she finally came with our drinks I asked that she just put our refills in right away so that we wouldn't be without drinks for a period of time again. She refused and said she would keep an eye on us and come back when we were almost finished to give us refills. I was baffled but didn't feel like arguing with her again. I knew, once again that was a LIE. We sipped slowly but still finished our drinks before she made it back and were once again without anything to drink for who knows how long... Maybe about 5 minutes. She finally came back, took our cups to the bar and they were REUSED... They didn't even change out the straw. Idk about you, but to me it's off putting to get a straw with lip prints on it because it could be mine but it could also not be mine. And it's not sanitary to have something that was in my mouth behind the bar where you're mixing drinks. What if the ice scoop touched my straw? That just didn't sit right with me because apparently that's a common practice here since she knew to do that. Anyway, so after being delivered 2 or 3 plates of food that we didn't order and having to constantly explain that it wasn't ours we finally got our food... My friend's burger and my pasta. Her burger looked great and she enjoyed it, my pasta however was clearly burned. It had black and brown bits all through it and big chunks of burnt bits that had been scraped up from the bottom of the pan. The shrimp was overcooked and the whole dish tasted burnt. I couldn't believe they had actually served that to me! The cook clearly didn't care enough to restart the dish after he realized he burned it and the wait staff apparently didn't notice that it didn't look right. Is there no measure of quality control? I sent it back and the waitress said she'd get me a new one. Apparently there was no urgency even tho the kitchen was due to close in 25 minutes. After 15 minutes had passed I cancelled my order and left hungry. Ended up going to Wawa. I won't be returning to this Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-largo?start=80,1.72,1.72,1.72,1.3519999999999999,1.7200000000000002
115,Melissa D.,"Jacksonville, FL",59,48,13.0,3.0,2015-04-03,"Upon entering the restaurant, I was greeted with ""hot and fresh out the kitchen.""  No, this was not a cheesy coordinated staff greeting. Instead, the restaurant had a famous singer blaring through the speakers. I was admittedly a little taken aback by the volume and type of music played, but as a fan of R&B I wasn't too bothered.  My dining companion and I were seated shortly after entering the restaurant. That is, unfortunately, where the convenience ended. The seats at which we were sitting were literally falling apart and after our initial conversation with the waitress, it was hard to get her attention despite the fact that the restaurant was almost entirely empty. When it was time to order we decided to try something different as this Friday didn't offer the specials we were accustomed to. I opted for the medium well sirloin with broccoli, mashed potatoes, and ribs. My companion got almost the exact same thing but opted for Jack Daniel-flavored ribs. (Don't judge. I got the ribs for the sole purpose of having leftovers to enjoy later.)  Now, normally restaurants seem to have a policy of delivering food and drinks to everyone at the table simultaneously. This was not the case here. For both our food and our drinks, one of us would get what was ordered a significant amount of time before the other. This was particularly strange given the fact that we ordered similar things. Anyways, onto the actual food. I took a picture of my meal in case anyone is wondering. When I got my food, I was initially disappointed. My broccoli looked like it had been around for a while and had been heated in a microwave. Nevertheless, I pushed past my disappoint to bite into my food. After battling it out with my sirloin, whose exterior was much tougher than I expected, I was rewarded with a succulent steak. It seemed well seasoned and, oddly enough, paired well with the BBQ sauce meant for the ribs. There was something about those two tastes that complimented each other and more than made up for the disappointing broccoli and mediocre mashed potatoes.  Now, of course, I just had to try the ribs out. For Yelp, course. ;) The ribs were practically falling off the bone, but paired awkwardly with the BBQ sauce. I tried some of my companion's Jack Daniel ribs and felt that it seemed like a more palatable combination.  I thought it was a decent deal for the price I paid. I just wish we didn't have to do so much waiting on our waitress and for one another to get what was ordered. Generally, I enjoy this chain restaurant, but this particular location left much to be desired in terms of customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-largo?start=40,1.76,1.76,1.76,1.452,1.7600000000000002

However it takes forever for a waiter to actually acknowledge me at the table.  After waiting too long we motioned for the waitress next to us, asking her to take our order. She stated that we weren't her table, but she would go ahead and service us. The manager (who had just taken 50% off of the tab of the table behind us because they complained about their horrible experience) asked us how our service was going. We explained our long wait time and she confirmed that the waitress that ""would go ahead and service us"" was actually assigned to our table all along. We were seated in her section. She didn't notice us there and tried to blame it on someone else. Perhaps she didn't notice us because she was too busy sitting on her boyfriends lap in the booth next to us... I visit a second time. It's a Thursday night so the music is so loud I have to yell to speak to people right next to me. Again, I was seated quickly but waited long for someone to take my order. Once we finally received our meals, it seemed like another 5 mins before we got forks, knives, and napkins. Just enough time for my food to start getting cold. Good customer service involves refilling cups when you see them getting low, before there is nothing but ice left. Of course this didn't happen. I finish my drink and put the cup at the edge of the table so it was in clear sight. The waiter walked past our table and didn't notice we needed refills. I get his attention, he says he'll get us refills. 5 minutes later he walks by our table again, empty handed. He completely forgot about our refills. He makes a U turn and gets us drinks.

I found a booth in bar area, hostess walks by and says I can't sit here, which baffles me because I was JUST TOLD that I could sit in the bar area.

What she should have said ""seating at the bar is open, just as an FYI booths in the bar area are NOT available""  Hostess goes to check with waiter who says he can't serve us. This was ridiculous..

Very unwelcoming and not the environment I'm sure a corporately owned Fridays should present.

PLEASE turn off this blasting music that you play all time... It's way too much.  2. If seating hasn't ended for the night... Seat the guests.  3.

The water tastes like tap water taken out of the Potomac river. When we got our apps, we got no app plates. The chicken wing bites were ice cold in the middle. Plus we asked for blue cheese and got ranch.   The tostado nachos were missing the beef and retried beans---so it was essentially a cracker with cheese.   The mistake came when we asked the waitress to add chicken. They substituted the beef and beans with chicken.  My cheeseburger was MIA for a half hour. When I got it, the fries were cold.  The edges of my cheeseburger were burned and bitter from the charring.  The manager visited us and said they would take off the chicken nacho app. When we got our app plates, mine was wet with what appeared to be a very small blade of grass that was black.  Stay away.

The food is always good and when it's busy, I do see a manager helping out which is great, but I think the professionalism is lacking, the friendliness, and the communication between staff members. For instance, our food went to the wrong table, and another occasion, we waited so long for the tab that I was tempted to walk out.

We were welcomed by our waitress who seemed a little off but took our order well, my husband and i both got the endless apps swap for $12 and i also ordered a side salad. She brought out the appetizers first forgetting my side salad which pissed me off (I am a volatile pregnant mama right now and I really did not appreciate having to wait 20 mins for something so simple I was desperately craving) not to mention that the cidar glazed wings I got literally looked as if the pinche maricón cook just splashed a little bit of sauce on them, I had to keep asking the waitress where my salad was and all I got is it's coming. It DOES NOT TAKE THAT LONG TO MAKE A SALAD AND BRING IT OUT, I didn't get my salad until the SECOND APPETIZER CAME OUT WHICH TOOK FOREVER! After our first appetizer ... my husband wanted to get the new braised beef tostada next only to find out that they were out of them, that right there literally made me want to cancel our order and leave but as we had just ate obviously we could not do that and I still wanted my salad. So putting that aside my husband then decided to order the fried green beans which by our surprise the manager told us they were also out of? Only later on to have the waitress tell us they were not out of them and would get him a order right away... What kind of establishment are you trying to run? I've worked in the food business to know if you're out of stock you make plans right away to get that item, especially T.G.I. fridays because most of the pre-packaged food you get can be easily ordered and restocked within a hour. Then you give us the run around as to you may or may not have this item? Oh and waitress if you're wondering why I only tipped you $2 is because of your oblivious and careless demeanor, not bringing my salad until the next app which was a little more than 20 mins and I know that the salad was made way before, you just left it until you felt ready to bring it out. Then having my husband wait 30 mins for a refill of water, you were only serving another group of people in the next booth in front of us that you were just so chatty cathy with.  You've got to be kidding me! The place is ghetto, the staff is ghetto, and the music they play is just horrible.  Not to mention my husband had to ask our waitress numerous times to get him a water ; overall I did not enjoy the experience at this trashy restaurant and am not please with where my money went, because honestly it went down the drain.

78,J F.,"Laurel, MD",4,42,6.0,1.0,2016-04-11,"Yesterday I had the extreme misfortune of going to TGI Friday's at The Boulevard (Store 2151). I was given your contact information by an uncouth woman who presented herself to be the manager on duty.  I picked up food for a friend who is ill, and what should have been a perhaps 15-minute ordeal turned into an hour and a half.  First, when I called to order, I was placed on hold. I have worked retail for quite a bit, so I understand that it can get busy. However, I was only hold for thirty minutes.  At that point, it did not make sense to hang up and call back. So I waited, and I was finally able to place my order. At that point, I waited another 20 minutes before heading over to pick the food up. I entered Friday's at 6:00 and I left at 6:41PM.  This was my first time at this location. The music was so loud I could not hear the host's directions, then when he did give me directions it was to the wrong place to pick my food up. I ended up asking a customer if she knew where I could pick up and she graciously told me.   I waited roughly 20 minutes in the To Go Area before I was helped or acknowledged by any of the four servers in that area. They were laughing, playing, dancing and singing along to the loud music while I, the customer, sat there helplessly. When a woman finally did approach me about ordering, I tried screaming to her the name of my order (again the music was louder than a club on Memorial Day) and she still did not hear me. When I finally got close enough to scream it in her ear, she gave me my total and I paid. She swiped the card, give me my receipt to sign, and a pen. She never came back. For 20 minutes. I sat there awkwardly with the growing number of people waiting to order to go.  Finally, I caught a server that passed me if there was a manager on duty. She said yes. I asked if I could speak to the manager and she said sure. Finally, about 10 minutes later I saw a Hispanic woman in gray pants, a black shirt and a headset. I deducted she was the manger based upon her  her appearance and how it differed from the servers.  I asked her if she was the manager. She said yes, never introducing herself or giving me a name. Instead she seemed hurried and tried to get away from me as if I was stopping her from going some place or bothering her. I told her I ordered well over and hour ago and I have been waiting a long time. She looked at me as if either I was an idiot, or she had no idea what I was talking about. At that point, I asked if she had a manager. Again, she looked at me if she didn't understand. Then very nastily, she told me, ""well your food's here any way, you can go"". No apology, no nothing. Again, I asked her if she had a manager and she basically ran to the front of the store and slapped a card in my hand. I had to scream out to her that I still had the signed receipt. She grabbed it from my hand and stormed off.  In the time that I waited, I could have been seated and ordered food to dine and probably had an appetizer or to. I waited well over an hour for a turkey burger with sweet potato fries. Never will I ever recommend this location to a friend, family member, enemy or even a homeless man on the street.  Please do something about the service and try to hire managers and servers that actually care about the customer, the product and the overall experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-largo?start=20,1.64,1.64,1.64,1.284,1.6400000000000001

Once seated no one came over for about 10min. Our server Keith was actually in a different section. He came and took care of us. Very helpful and efficient. When our drinks came out the girl was ok. We had to ask for straws. The table across from us had like 10 kids. Little kids running around and bumping into ppl even the servers. Then when our appetizers came out we had no plates, we had no napkins and suddenly or server disappeared.  Not happy now. My drink was decent though.  Food finally comes out, rather quickly I should say.  But it's warm not hot. My JD chix and shrimp had not been what I expected. I hadn't ordered it in a while.

Upon entering this establishment we were not greeted by a friendly host face. We instead waited 10 minutes awkwardly standing at the front until we sought out a waitress to find the hostess to seat us. After finding the hostess, we waited an additional 5 minutes for her to clean a table for us to sit. We arrived at 5pm on a Monday and the place was completely empty exclusive of the bar which was packed and running like a well oiled machine. All of the tables were dirty which was confusing considering only two other tables were sat. I would love to blame this on lazy workers, however an issue of this size is more than likely a management problem. The waitress brought one drink, and it took an additional 10 minutes to receive the second, which was a warm beer.  It took another 10 minutes to even order. That makes 30-40 minutes with 1 drink, 1 warm beer and no food on a Monday at 5 in an empty restaurant. Like seriously, please get it together!  If you need more staff, hire. If you need new employees, fire the old. If you need new management, mutiny. Something! It is ridiculous that customers should have to deal with such horrid service. I'm a huge advocate for leaving and not patronizing an establishment if the service is poor. But once you've already ordered, you are kind of stuck in purgatory until the end.

10,Steven A.,"Silver Spring, MD",2,42,8.0,1.0,2017-03-16,"How do you give .0006 of a star? That possible on Yelp? Seriously fellow Yelpers, please let me know if you can half star or half half a star a place.   Where do I begin? I came by to this Friday's at the start of happy hour (around 4pm or so) to watch a football match (soccer) while my lady got her hair done down the street.  Little did I know, I'd be spending the next 90 mins watching the match on my phone.   The waitress took my drink order, a cherry coke, and I asked her to turn on the TV directly in front of me to the channel the game was on.. Nothing. As I stated previously, I had my phone with me, so I wasn't really bothered at this time.  Even though the bar area wasn't busy, I gave them the benefit of the doubt.  Another 10 mins goes by.... Nothing.  As two gentlemen seat themselves next to me in visible frustration at the wait length at the door, my waitress walks by again.  I ask her again, ""can I get the game on this tv please?"" She acknowledges and proceeds to tell the barkeep to change the channel.   15 mins goes by... Halftime.  Still nothing.  Now I have a rather zen like patience, so I figure ""ok, halftime is 15 mins... I'll be able to watch the second half on the big tv.."" 15 mins later and the start of the second half... Nothing.   I jump on Google to find the channel listing for Directv (what's showing at the bar) to help expedite this process.  Again my waitress walks by, and this time I give her the channel number for which she relays to the barkeep... I'm within earshot, and he explains to her that he can't just change the channel because people are watching the game that's already on... Pause..  There are 20 other people at the bar, who are completely oblivious to the 12 or so tv screens on the bar area.  Most are getting ripped on $3 Long Island teas and snapchatting the afternoon away.  Did I mention there are 12 tv's in the area..? Even if people were watching them, which they weren't, you could accommodate one for the sole person that's asking for it, but I digress.  At this point, the two gentlemen seated next to me have ordered their drinks 4... Yes FOUR times now and received nothing.  They get up and leave.  One empathizes, but I'm no quitter.. Now it's become a waiting game. I'm no longer here to watch my team play, but moreso I'm here to watch how long it actually takes for them to respond to my 5 requests. (I'm still keeping up with the game on my phone btw.. ) In the 84th min or so, my waitress walks by and asks, ""did he put the game on for you?"" I show her my phone and reply, ""not yet.. Maybe tomorrow.."" I proceed to ask for the check given the pace this place operates at, I'll expect a bill in the mail tomorrow. She shakes her head and asks him for a 6th time to change the channel.  He tells her ok, ""gimme a second..."" and barrels off to the back freezer for some limes and ice.  Limes need to be as fresh as possible, so I get it ...   And of course, another couple clearly frustrated at the door, sit down and order their food.  The lady of the couple goes off and says ""there's no reason why we have to wait 25 mins when there are open tables at happy hour! I have no appetite anymore..."" followed by a slur of expletives that could burn a church down.  Again, one empathizes.  I turn to the couple and share my current tv fortunes with them but ask them kindly not to bring attention to it.  I'm in it to win it now.  94th min (injury time for you football fans out there) ... Nothing. Game over. My waitress comes over one last time and apologizes for the mishap and calls her manager over. 15 mins later the manager apologizes for the delay (yea had to wait for her too.. Kinda the theme here...) but I wasn't interested in the apology. I was moreso interested in how the length of a professional sporting contest can go by, and not a single flick of a remote control is worthy enough for paying customers. She rounds the barkeep up and he proceeds to claim ""I was busy.. and I didn't even notice anyone asking...""  Lol.. I didn't know what else to say.  I was about to shine the light on him and tell him that ""what.. the 6 times my waitress asked him to change the channel didn't suffice..?"" but we had won the game and made it the distances. So I was in somewhat of a good mood.  90 mins, 6 cherry cokes and 1/3 of my phones battery life later, I was speechless.   I tipped my waitress for her efforts (she did try) and left.  Now excuse me while I pull a Forrest Gump and pee all this out.. And oh yea, run.  Just run away from this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-largo,1.4,1.4,1.4,1.4120000000000001,1.4

I was always more familar with TGI Friday's im other states where it was a fairly decent restaurant for a night out for a lesser price than your outback or so.... boy does this TGI Fridays quickly taint any positive feelings one ever had. Where do i begin??? 1st time i went to this location 3 yrs ago it was exactly what i knew of TGI Fridays.  Fast forward to 2017 ..... lord have mercy!! Firstly i made the error of thinking this place was remotely appropriate for children. Yes. The wait time was 45mins. We finally get a table.  The bar looks and sounds like a Pub that may turn into a nightclub a few hours later. We sat. And sat. And sat. And may I say again AND SAT. Waiting for a server. Server comes finally takes our drink orders first. We sat again. Same cycle. He comes back. Informs me they don't have patron for the patron margarita??! Sir. So he asks if i want a substitute.  Well it wont be a patron rita will it. Anyway  im still giving chances. Well we sat again. Mind u my child's drink hasnt come nor my bfs drink either. So he comes back and states theres no glasses?!?! Okkk. So my drink comes in a plastic cup. Well go figure,  judging by the raising volume of voices as we sat in the entire restaurant. Nees2i mention the endless cursing by the parties at the adjacent table!! Well food eventually came an hr later. We were all over it and only Jesus knows why we sat there and subjected ourselves to this cruel and unusual punishment. Nvm that tbe server found all his ""explanations "" funny. I concluded he was "" on something"" because his demeanor was entirely too relaxed considering the torment we'd gone thru for almost 2 hrs.  I was pretty sure this was my utter last time at this joke of a restaurant. I hoped they were having an off day. Fast forward, i went back another day hoping it wld be better. No. Same wait time for table. Just looking at the clientele as we waited, i was concerned that it ""may go down"".  We sat for 5 mins and i had to converse with self.  This is plain a trashy restaurant, with unprofessional service and nobody in the restaurant staff cares and evidently now attracts the same type of clientele. Do not bring young kids here if u really must dine here and honestly ur better off at Applebees up the street. You will be pleasantly impressed. TGI franchise- I hope you realize the negative reputation this and from what I hear several Maryland locations particularly in PG county has created.

The bar wasn't crowded at all! They were out of Jameson (somebody messed up the liquor order that week smh), how do you run out of Jameson when it's a happy hour special?!  It took 25min for our Buffalo wings to come out and nobody asked if we were okay.  And to top things off, the bartender left the bar to go outside to stop a fight and collect check money. Bartenders tend bars, they are not referees.  More and more Fridays are disappointing me. The one in Waldorf is trash and now this one.

No biggie, especially when considering the fact that I came with a party of ten. Twenty-five minutes turned into forty-five minutes. At this point, my party was annoyed to no avail. The host FINALLY informed us that our table was ready for us. We all followed the host to our table, only to find out there was only a booth that only had seating capacity of five. The host looked really shocked as if he didn't know we had as many guests as we did.  There was a table next to the one we were brought to. The table had not been cleaned. Plates and food were scattered about. The hosts asked if we wanted to sit there. I gave our host the ""you've got to be kidding me"" face. But, I could tell by his reaction that he was very serious. The host proceed to clean the dirty table and called on the help of others to help him clean. The host never offered an apology, he said that he miscalculated how many guests our party had. Frustating!  The dining experience was the absolute worst. It took nearly twenty minutes before my party received their drinks. Drink orders were wrong and my friend ended up with an ant in her drink. Food orders arrived late as all get out. And get this, the orders were wrong as well.

The bulk of my party was there around 7:45 and we found that the location did not show the reservation that was submitted for 8:00. She also had a screenshot of this reservation that was made Friday prior to this catastrophic event. She was asked by Felicia (The Supervisor) if She had an e-mail as proof of the reservation. My aunt provided the email confirmation. Felicia  then stated, give her 5 minutes to get a table ready to accommodate my party. Keep in mind that it's about 8:00 now. We were seated at about 9:00pm. The waitress (Kierra) introduced herself and let us know that she would be back to take the drink order. She came back about 30 minutes later. My aunt asked to speak with the manager and asked him for corporate's contact information. He never provided it or his name. Kierra then, took another 30 minutes to come back with drinks and didn't bring everyone's order. Renee (the Hostess) Came back to take our appetizer orders. She was actually very rude the entire time. She had the audacity to walk to my table briskly and asked ""What  you say"" in her own words. I said, excuse me? I am having a conversation with my cousin at my table. I asked to speak with a supervisor as my aunts birthday celebration was getting her to the brink of tears as she was so angry at this entire situation. How dare that waitress come to me that way, she needs to be terminated. I actually felt threatened. One of my guests asked about getting some water that she never received. Renee stated that ""I only have two hands. That was the breaking point. Once we received the food order, they were incorrect or missing. Still no drinks as well. We finally asked for the cake to come out so that we could remove ourselves from this terrible experience. Keep in mind that we did not leave the restaurant until 12:00am. No one else could accommodate such a large party that last minute but, I feel awful for this experience on my aunt's birthday. This location is horrid and needs a restructuring completely!

We sat at the bar and were greeted by the bartender, I believe his name was Rudy. He was excellent. He was so tentative to my husband and I and made sure our drinks and waters were filled at all times. My husband ordered the endless apps and he made sure my husband got them as soon as they came out. Rudy was also going back and forth to the chicken as well to check on the food, not just for us, but others at the bar who ordered food. Personally, I think there should be a food runner that brings food out, especially to the bartenders, because they can't always leave to go back to the kitchen. I think that is an issue management needs to fix. I used to work in the restaurant business and that is what we always did, especially on the weekends when the bar is the busiest. My husband and I will def be back and be sitting with Rudy again. He also mentioned to us about Friday's rewards as well which we never knew about! We used to go to the Fridays in Silver Spring all the time and not once did they mention the reward program, so I am kind of salty about that because my husband and I could have racked up some points.

Yet, I was standing in front of them with my child and her friend. Another party was told their name wasn't on the list...later discovered on skipped page. A third party had to point out their name as well. The hosts were dismissive,  uninterested,  and unapologetic. I then went to a bartender to request a manager. He was polite and suggested I sit at bar. Since I had minors that was not an option. The bartender was nice enough and quickly called manager when asked. The manager arrived after a few minutes. HUNGRY and frustrated, I explained the young woman lacked training and was not in control of the area. There was a young man that was just as confused and whose body language indicated he could careless. I shared there were several parties that had not been seated. Manager said no one else could be seated because of a water issue. The manager conveyed it was not the restaurant but the area flushing water through.
