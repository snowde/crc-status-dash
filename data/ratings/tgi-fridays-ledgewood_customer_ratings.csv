39,Joe S.,"Landing, NJ",0,6,,1.0,2013-05-10,"So I ordered a Ribeye, which normally is a very good steak.  The first go around was not only below standard it was in the gutter.  The meat was not only raw and not medium rare as I ordered but there was so much grizzle a steak knife could not even cut through it.  The waiter was very nice and offered another steak which I accepted. In the mean time I ate the broccoli that was so hard I needed the steak knife to cut and the other side of tomato and mozzarella salad. Who has ever seen yellowish grape tomatoes before - only at Friday's apparently.  So the next cut of ribeye was at least cooked medium rare but it was so full of grizzle and fat only half of it was edible. The broccoli was still hard as a rock and the tomato and mozz salad was still with non ripe grape tomatoes.  The hotess did comp my steak as she should have and gave us two deserts for my son and me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ledgewood?start=20,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052

31,Noelle S.,"Morristown, NJ",7,41,31.0,5.0,2013-10-23,I go to this Friday's at least once a week.  I always go for lunch and recommend sitting at one of the high top tables at the bar.  The bartenders and super friendly and are on top of all requests.  They have a 2 for $12 option which frequently gets promoted on TV and during that time they lower the price to 2 for $10.  You can get a great appetizer and good entrée for $10!! I have been a TGIF card member for years.  I used to just collect the points and show it to get free chips and salsa.  Once I got over 2000 points I figured I should start using it.  Well I ate free for over a month. For just 100 points you can get a free entrée.  I currently have 900 points so that's 9 free meals for me:) They also have $3 appetizers of Thursdays.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ledgewood?start=20,2.452,2.452,2.452,2.452,2.452

27,Metin A.,"Newark, DE",22,97,22.0,4.0,2014-04-28,"Everyone likes to rip on chain restaurants.  Maybe we all expect too much after visiting cozy, mom & pop establishments?  Regardless, I have to say this TGI Fridays is one of the better ones in the franchise I've visited. The service is always prompt and friendly and the food has never been incorrect.  Steaks are actually cooked to order, and they don't just drown everything in sauce.  You definitely get what you pay for (and a little bit more) here--lunch specials are very good, and sharing dinner specials can get you a lot of food with little hurt to your wallet. Good atmosphere on Friday/Saturday nights as well.  Downside?  They don't really take reservations--even with large groups.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ledgewood?start=20,2.256,2.256,2.256,2.256,2.256

28,Dan K.,"Dunedin, FL",0,94,,3.0,2014-05-24,"TGI Fridays has a new menu. I know I went there the other day and it was so new it smelt fresh. And the hostess was promoting the fresh not frozen steak and chicken. Does that mean the seafood is not fresh? Back to the menu, it didn't seem that there were new dishes though. They do a lot to promote their Jack Daniel's sauce meals. I must admit that I haven't been to TGI Fridays in a long while, but used to frequent it so much that I became a Stripes member. I had points and receive their online coupons all the time. So with coupon in hand, my wife and decided to stop by after an afternoon attending a wake. Guess what? There are so many rules and restrictions, that our coupon would not apply to the dinners we wanted. No problem, I had points in my account and when I logged on and chose one (free chicken or seafood dinner). I found out it too had limitations; I couldn't have the chicken AND seafood dinner that was recommended by our waiter, only a choice of the inexpensive chicken or seafood meals (there is only one seafood meal on the menu that I could see). The Stripes program has changed over the years that I have been a member, but not for the good. Although, service was good, we used to be acknowledged by the manager on duty (not this time), and without a variation in menu choices, I think I will only go when other dinner options aren't available.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ledgewood?start=20,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005

I was so impressed with our server (Edgar). He accommodated all our requests (there was quite a few) and was very attentive. We ordered the endless apps ($10 for an endless appetizer [one bummer, you can only order the same app]) and while he passed by the table noticed the empty plate and without even asking, he said he'd get another order in (love it!).  He brought napkins when we need it the most (bibs wouldn't have even stopped the Jack Daniels mess I was making) and kept our waters filled at all times.  The foods ok, it's a bit sad you need the super fatty sauces to get some real flavors in the dishes. We waited quite a long time for the food to arrive too, no fault on the server, (he did make it a note to apologize for it)...but it was a really long wait for a few entrees.

Over the last year, we have seen a single nice fat burger shrink to 2 smaller patties, then to just a standard fast food size burger.  Profit is good, but this has become a rip-off at $12.50.  The fries were so salty we could not eat them - and the garlic or onion flavor was also way overdone.  I used to enjoy TGIF's fries, where you could taste the potatoes and not have a heart attack from the sodium!  The other food was OK (it used to be better also).  Our server was nice and competent, but the wait time was too long.  We may try another Friday's, but won't be coming back here.  Too many other great burger options in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ledgewood?start=20,1.704,1.704,1.704,1.704,1.704

12,Jen W.,"Highland Park, NJ",5,1,,1.0,2016-06-04,"Miserable service. Our party of 4 (including a child) were seated at a table that only had 3 chairs. There were other tables that had 4. I gave the child the seat and had to wait a few minutes for them to find an ""extra"" chair.  Our appetizers came and we didn't have small plates, and one was missing its dipping sauce. We had to wait some time before the waitress came to check on us, and 10 mins later she came with the missing sauce, but not the plates & napkins we had requested. I mentioned we came with a child. She needed her food cut for her (on a plate), and she refuses to eat mozzarella sticks without sauce. Having to wait 10 mins and use her napkin to cut her food on caused much more turmoil than if it were just us adults. I had ordered a regular cheese burger with bacon. The waitress never asked me how I wanted it cooked. The runners brought our food to the wrong table (across from ours), then gave us each the wrong plates - we swapped them around ourselves. And they left the empty appetizer plates on the table. Then I realize, this is not the burger I ordered. After waiting a while, our waitress reappeared & I explain what happened. She apologized and offered to replace the burger. I accepted her offer, despite everyone else having what they ordered. She left the wrong burger on the table. As if I would suddenly want to eat it. I nibbled on the fries while I waited & everyone else ate their meal (including our finicky kiddo). Twenty five minutes later she decided to check in on us & I asked about my burger. I'm fairly certain she had forgotten about it. After all, I still had a plate of uneaten food in front of me! I told her if it happened to be ready, please put it in a container because everyone else had finished & I didn't want to hold them up. She vanished. Ten minutes after THAT, some poor runner offered me my burger. Well, my make up burger. This one had no bacon. All I ordered was a bacon cheddar burger. No bells. No whistles. I told him to put it in a box because I was not able to eat it there. He disappeared.  Another 10 mins & I have my make up burger in a styrofoam box. The waitress returned & did not offer dessert, she said she would just get the check. Why did we have to wait 20 minutes for the offer of a check? The bill came & she charged us for the makeup burger and offered a vague apology.  I'm ashamed to say we left no tip. None. Not a cent. And I used to serve; I know how hard it is & how much of your income relies on tips. But for a tip, you should make some type of effort to please the customer. The entire experience was miserable. I've eaten there many times before and never had a problem. And the burger? It was overcooked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ledgewood,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

So second time we did the endless apps... food was cold service was eh from past experiences the reasoning for it on a Friday night at dinner time was because everyone came in at once and the kitchen wasn't able to keep up. Sorry but that's not really a reason for a chain restaurant to have slow service and cold food. Especially one that's seen busier nights. Finally today we got a gift card and said screw it let's try it again. Well took about 10 mins for our waitress to get over to us. We ordered a cherry limeade slushie and got a strawberry lemonade slushie. The strawberry seeds in it gave that away real quick. And went to order a beer on tap was told the taps weren't working okay fine whatever.  then we order... we got an app, one meal, and endless apps meal. So our app came with the first endless app that was order. We got the new spinach queso wasn't even fully cooked and it was queso on a bed of spinach with bread crumbs on top... not worth it. Btw they got rid of the fried pickles for all you pickle lovers out there. So the next order for the endless apps comes out and the meal is no where. We asked for it and it came out no problem. The second endless app were boneless wings they didn't bring any blue cheese or ranch. The meal was the bourbon barrel chicken. Which was not bad and it was great to know the broccoli was fresh thanks to a prep sticker being left on and found on the plate. So the last endless app we ordered came out it was the chicken flat bread. That was just sad. There were 4 little pieces of shredded chicken on 2 pieces. Throughout all of this our waitress was no where to be found but would randomly appear to ask if we wanted to order anything else. This Fridays will not be seeing us ever again and we won't be recommending it as a place to go out. We frequently go out and know some nights are just bad but 3 times and only getting worse... nah.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ledgewood,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2

2,Yuki S.,"Hopatcong, NJ",5,13,8.0,2.0,2017-10-16,"*Update* I go to TGIS often with my boyfriend and I usually get the same thing, the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. It used to be so good, but that choice has gotten SO much worse over the years. They barely give you any chicken at all with this order my best way of describing it would be ""kid's size."" On top of that, the tomato mozzarella salad is awful almost all the time, this is mostly because the tomatoes taste rotten. Now the pasta, they used to give you some really good Ravioli with the dish, heck, I even enjoyed the Penne pasta...but Mac and Cheese? Come on! The way they prepare this dish now, it's not worth the amount they're asking for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ledgewood,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12

Stood at the front door for 5 minutes and had the bartenders stare at us and just not care. Do you want business or not????,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ledgewood,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08

Not only did he not speak, but didn't clear a plate so I didn't have any elbow room which I'm pretty tight about. Beer was pretty good though. Table was also very sticky which was kinda killing my vibe",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ledgewood,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08

3,John M.,"Roxbury Township, NJ",0,5,,1.0,2017-12-22,"We live local so have been here enough to say even for a chain that's a step up from fast food- this place is awful. Tonight was exactly the same- crappy food with worse service. I got Jack Daniels chicken strip app as dinner- the majority of the meal was just bread crumbs, possibly 6 small pieces of chicken. Asked my server to bring it out as my meal so it would be there the same time as my wife's - 15 minutes after I got the app, my wife's meal came out. Common sense- couple there for dinner would like their meal at the same time. I did get a refill on my drink, but to my chagrin my empty glass and dirty plates from our chips were left on the table during our meal. I don't expect much at a chain but this location is terrible and no reason to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ledgewood,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88
0,Melinda G.,"Audubon, NJ",65,1,,3.0,2017-12-27,"Don't bother with the endless apps menu, they say u can pick 3 yet you're only allowed to order 2 at a time and it takes forever to come out, they only bring you a little bit of the app so you finish it rather quickly and you're not allowed to order the next 2 until you're done but then that takes forever as well...it's def not worth it! They make it sound like a deal but the way it works it def ruins it! And then when u order more apps (endless) the waiter gives you an attitude! The service sucks! Not happy honestly! John was completely annoyed that I asked for my apps and then assumed I wanted something which I didn't and then when I corrected him he got nasty! Also sitting here with an empty glass for a long time now!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ledgewood,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
