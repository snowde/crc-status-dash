1,Siobhain W.,"Sandyford, Republic of Ireland",51,148,18.0,3.0,2012-05-09,"I had dinner here a couple of times while I was staying in the Premier Inn above TGI's. It is just so handy when you are staying there. The first time I was there, I got a burger, which I thought was a bit dry. The other two times I went I had a Chicken Finger BLT and Chicken Goujons, which were extremely tastey!  I did find the the chicken finger BLT which was so big, there was just way too much food for one person (which is not usually my normal complaint!) I usually like to eat all my dinner, but I couldn't eat half it! The Chicken Goujons were much more manageable!  I must say, my two favourite things about TGI Fridays: The AMAZING garlic bread and the brilliant cocktails.  Overall, you can't really complain! You get exactly what you want from an American style restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-leeds,,,,,

0,Jennifer N.,"Costa Mesa, CA",43,65,,2.0,2017-05-30,"We came here for a quick bite, and went away unsatisfied and puzzled. What was puzzling?  When we arrived the host greeted us and said we'd have to wait forty minutes due to ""inexperienced staff in the kitchen"" - huh?  Even though I asked him to explain, I just couldn't grasp the concept of how the kitchen staff had any effect on the number of people who came to the restaurant.  Even more puzzling, the restaurant was obviously less than half full... When we were finally seated, my puzzlement morphed into dissatisfaction - the ribs I ordered were just barely warm, and the fries that were served with them were stone cold. Apparently the TGI portion of this place's name stands for ""The Greatest Insult"" Tip: If you can't find anyplace better to eat (and from here there's nowhere to go but up) come prepared for a long wait",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-leeds,,,,,
