39,Lisa P.,"Auburn, MA",14,3,,1.0,2014-03-15,"My family as I had the worst dining out experience ever today at this location: Welp, first it took 45 min to get our food-ok fine it's a busy Saturday afternoon.  My fiancé does not like mayo and the waitress proceeded to argue with him that if he doesn't like mayo he needs to order something else because all the condiments are pre-portioned and they can't take it off. Really? Since when? Anyway- When we finally got the food it was all wrong-mine, my fiancé and my sons. The waitress was proud to report that my fiancé  was ""lucky"" to get his burger with no mayo, and then proceeded to argue with us again that the food was correct-we are not idiots, we know what we ordered.  So with an attitude and a snotty look that I almost slapped off her face, she got the manager (jannine. Sp) who did not care. We told her about the crap attitude and food and she did not care. She comped the meal, but never apologized. Not even a sorry.  We thought my sons  meal was edible so me and my fiancé  sat with no food and no offer of food so my son  could eat. Half way done his burger we realized the bottom was black, like burned and dried out. Idk how he ate it and didn't complain lol My fiancé then asked Jannine her name and told her he was calling corporate, she again did not care, she walked away with a stupid smirk on her face. What happened to good customer service? We had a bad experience in millbury but they atleast tried there best to make up for it. I can respect that cuz shit happens.  But today no one cared. Fridays used to have high standards for employees.

35,Kurtis H.,"Leominster, MA",2,34,74.0,2.0,2014-07-05,"I generally loathe big box chain restaurants, but a friend was in town for the July 4th holiday, and suggested Fridays for lunch. I had never been to one so I figure at least try something new. The building is located right next to Best Buy and Olive Garden. Parking was ample and I made my way inside. The first thing I noticed was it was very industrial and open. Exposed duct work, scored concrete floors, and open-floor layout. I do mean open. There's few booths versus a slew of open-area tables plus the bar. My friend said there was a wait for a table. Looking around, I wasn't sure why as I saw plenty of open tables and there aren't many other people in the waiting area with us. There was maybe six people total, two per party, so there was enough open seats as a typical table seats four. My friend told me the hostess said they were short staff and the kitchen was backed up. I'm already on-guard for a bad experience at this point. Granted it's a holiday, but still, most places beef up on holidays, especially one when it was known remnants of a hurricane were coming through days before. In about five minutes were seated in the area straight in the back from the entrance near the kitchen and restrooms. The seats were uncomfortable. Looking around it was moderately busy, but by no means ""slammed"". Our waiter, I forget his name, came over to take our order or start us off with drinks. He has zero personality. He's not engaging at all and everything felt forced from him. We put in for drinks and looked at our menus. I honed in on the NY Cheddar and Bacon Burger, which, per Friday's website is: ""Sharp New York Cheddar, applewood-smoked bacon, Cajun-spiced fried onion strings and a sweet chow-chow relish."" My friend ordered a Balsamic-Glazed Chicken Caesar Salad, which, again, per the website is, ""Grilled balsamic-marinated all-natural chicken breast served over freshly chopped romaine tossed in a Caesar Vinaigrette with shaved Parmesan and tomatoes."" I like my beef cooked medium-well; slightly pink. Normally you are asked how you'd like the meat cooked in most placed. I wasn't asked and before I could offer it up, our server scooted off. The wait time was average for our meal, approximately 15-20 minutes give or take. At first glance, my burger and fries looked decent. I would have taken pictures, but I believe in table etiquette when with company. I was perplexed by the fries' presentation which was a in a small, ripped pouch (think a small order of fries from McDonald's) that looked haphazardly dumped onto the plate, capped off with the pouch. The burger looked fine until I removed the bun. It looked like it was dipped in grease. The ""fried onion strings"" looked terribly small in quantity and size. The meat looked semi-decent with even grilled marks. but that's what I could see and the cheddar slice was slathered all over, there was some bacon, maybe a strip or two (I honest can not remember). All other condiments were just ""there"" in a heap. My friend's salad looked decent, if you could get by the four pieces that were a quarter inch thick, two and a half inch long strips of grilled chicken. Even he remarked at the lack of chicken. It's amazing what you'll eat when hungry. The fries were hot and relatively tasty. The burger was lukewarm at best and incredibly messy to eat. They give you one chintzy napkin and since our waiter was MIA, I reached over to the empty table behind me and took the spares sitting there. The taste of the burger was incredibly bland everything seemed like it was piled in random portions. The grease was obscene after each bite. I have to say, I've gone to fast food places and had better burgers. The meal at best was edible. My friend commented that aside from the stark lack of chicken, his salad was perfectly dressed, the lettuce was crisp, and tomatoes fresh.  During the meal, the traffic into the establishment picked up and the table where I helped myself to napkins was occupied now by a family of three who were being served by our waiter. The father, a large husky man, tried getting his attention by saying loudly, ""Excuse me"" and motioning with his hand as the waiter passed by maybe five feet away. The waiter never even acknowledged him. The noise level was below ""normal"" but I wasn't surprised given he has no personality. Now I'm not sure if my experience was due to the holiday and/or poor staffing. Looking at other reviews and seeing common themes, I'm leaning toward ""poor staffing/management"". I have the sense this is the norm rather than an anomaly.  Unfortunately Friday's nearly epitomizes why I try and stay away from chains. The service was mediocre, the food was barely tolerable, and the atmosphere felt more like a institutional cafeteria, if that makes sense.  I may go again at some point just to see if my initial experience was a one-off, but I have the feeling it's not. Your mileage may vary if you try Fridays in Leominster.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-leominster?start=20,1.608,1.608,1.608,1.608,1.6080000000000003

33,Anne S.,"Middlefield, CT",2,109,,1.0,2014-12-28,"We have enjoyed going to the TGI Friday's in New Jersey till our move to this area.  Our first visit was not bad.  We brought the family for the next visit and it was a disaster of epic proportion.  We were seated in the back and no waitress in sight.  Ten minutes go by and a family were seated a few seats away.  Fifteen minutes go by and they have their drinks.  I have to go ask the hostess for a waitress.  The waitress was not good.   She was young and acted like she was doing us a favor by just standing there, not listening to our order as she kept having us repeat it over and over.  Hubs got the chicken wings as a entree.  They were out in under ten minutes with no sauce.  She was like, sorry.  Burgers arrived.  What happened?? They got smaller and the buns were fresh out of the refrigerator, nice and cold.  The kids got a container full of fries, mine was not even half full.  We were all very hungry.  I asked for some more as she can see it was no where near a full order.  That came back a big fat NO from the kitchen.  Not off to a good start at all.  My burger got the end pieces of tomato with the stem in it.  Not edible unless I was a farm animal.  Same with the onion nub.  I really hate to be so dissatisfied especially since this was a special occasion.  All of our medium burgers were sent out extra well done with a crisp black coating on the outside.  That was it.  I told them to take it all off the bill, we are leaving.  They ended the 2 for 20.00 dinners.  No values here, quite the opposite.  Prices went way up, portions way down. If you think you were lucky to get a seat, I have noticed this location has been pretty empty lately.  Everyone went over to Chile's where the prices are still affordable and the portions are not bad.  Happy hour every night 4-6.  And they do everything to make your dinner out a good experience.  We work hard for every dollar and when we can go out, I want to have a good experience.  Plus, they have specials each night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-leominster?start=20,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003

OK fine... so why not tell me BEFORE I ordered it? Then she obviously had no intention of taking it off the bill till I reminded her there was only one skewer. This was met with a very accusational toned ""there was only one?"" ...yeah lady, I really hid the other to get a free $6 appetizer.

16,Liz R.,"Leominster, MA",0,22,1.0,1.0,2016-12-27,"I've never felt more disappointed about the food at a restaurant before. I recently went in with a few of my friends for dinner and I ordered the spinach florentine flatbread as a main. Worst mistake I could have made. Absolutely disgusting. The menu claims the flatbread has artichoke hearts, fresh basil, and garlic, none of which were present on the flatbread. It was like eating a piece of cardboard overloaded with red pepper flakes and oregano with old tomatoes, no taste at all. To top it all off the whole bottom of the flatbread was burnt, seriously? $9.00 down the toilet.  I thought I would give TGI's another chance after a few less than great visits this year, but this is the last straw. The quality of food is beyond repair and I will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-leominster,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003

I sit at the bar and the first time I ordered a vodka tonic. He asked what sort of vodka and I told him something yummy. Now each visit (about a week apart), it's been the same bartender on and each time he's remembered what I like and has me sampling the different vodkas. It's fun! I order food to go and it's been very good each time. I've asked the bartender's opinion on food and he's recommended what I've gotten. Tonight I had the parm chicken with cheddar mac-n-cheese and a salad.  Maybe they've improved the staff or maybe I'm just not as grumpy as some people but for what I've had, I can't complain. Normally I'm not a chain restaurant person but I've tried restaurants around here and I'll keep coming back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-leominster?start=20,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002

He said our server was on break and he gave us another waitress. She was good but she was in the weeds because she was taking on our table and her section.  Food: I got the endless apps, so what. Some in our group got the chicken club. See the picture of the bread. Burnt Black!! The hamburger bun was wet! Like soaked with water wet. Did not eat! All food either bad or unremarkable.  Drinks: ok the Bloody Mary is silly and fun. If I was drinking brunch and could pass on the food, it would get 4 stars. The drinks are priced right.  Atmosphere: new store. Clean and fashionable.  All and all, I will not go back. The atmosphere is nice and they have good drink prices, but this did not compensate for the bad service and really bad kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-leominster,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002
19,Laura G.,"Nashua, NH",0,3,,1.0,2017-04-07,"I took my 6 year old grandson out for a celebratory dinner for making Student of the Month last night.  He is a VERY picky eater, so when he wanted to forgo Chilis Chicken fingers, for TG I Friday's, I was pretty excited because he typically sticks to Chilis. I wish now we did Chilis night!  His chicken fingers were so over cooked that he had to gnaw on the skin to get to the chicken and the were EXTREMELY salty!  His chocolate milk had very little Chocolate in it where HE said it's plain milk. I ordered the California Chicken Club Sandwich.  After quite a long wait, it FINALLY came.  The visual alone when the waitress put it in front of me, made my mouth drop open.  It was much smaller than what the picture makes it look like.  It wasn't a chicken breast as the description says.  It was deli meat.   It was ice cold on the inside and the roll was burnt.  On top of that, I got LESS fries than my Grandson did in his kids meal!!   I sent it back and ordered a burger instead.  45 minutes later after my Grandson was finished and getting antsy to leave, my burger came.  At that point I had to eat fast! All in all ,  TGIF won't be my pick in the future.  Big changes would need to happen.    Back to Chilis!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-leominster,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002

We ordered endless apps and the first round took so long and came out cold, the next batch was a lit better but still had to wait a long time.  The only reason not a 1 star is the drinks price. The service during the day is great and personable. The night staff seemed very unhappy to be there. Part of this I do not blame them with all the other comments that I have read with management.  Lastly, we went for a final four game and asked 6 or 7 different people to change the channel to the game instead of a different college all star game that had already happened and was a rerun. They told us each time they would change it but nothing happened. Add that to slow food and it was not enjoyable at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-leominster,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002

No big deal. 15 mins later, our appetizers came out before we got our drinks. I could tell my drink was sitting down for a while at the bar. It taste water down.      When we finally got our food,  it's wasn't hot. It wasn't that hot. That was it. I tip according to the service I get. I didn't leave much.

21,Epeater K.,"Worcester, MA",1,29,1.0,2.0,2017-06-07,Went there on a Monday evening around 730. The place wasn't very busy but getting our food took forever. We didn't get out of there until 9. The kitchen was so slow. How long does it take to reheat a turkey patty? We all know that food is pre prepared and processed.. Not from scratch by any means but obviously you don't go to this place expecting that. I could see people standing around in back by the kitchen chatting. I under if it's the end of your shift and you want to or have to stay a while but you give customers the impression that you're just standing around when you should be working. Also there was only one bartender on who was also cleaning up tables. Sounds like a case of poor staff management,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-leominster?start=20,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88

We had gotten the meatballs and you can totally tell they were frozen. The Bloody Mary mix was straight from the supermarket shelf and not the good kind. The all you can eat appetizers is per person at the table, even if they don't eat any. On another occasion I had gone and waited nearly 15 to be acknowledged initially, we said at minute fifteen we would leave and the waitress made an appearance with fifteen second to spare.

The first thing I noticed was that the spinach dip was supposed to come with guacamole it didn't. My daughters chocolate milk was just milk with all the syrup on the bottom. Our meals came out about 20 mins later my wife's burger was raw so we went to check our daughters sliders and they were raw as well. My sizzling cheesy chicken was not sizzling as it had been under the heaters forever my mashed potatoes had a film over them . We spoke to the server and I reordered a Cobb salad and they took the burgers back. My daughters came back cook but my wife's came back raw a second time and my Cobb salad was missing the egg and the avocado . I was so disappointed and sick when I left there .
