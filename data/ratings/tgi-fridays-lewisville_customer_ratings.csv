58,Chad C.,"Denton, TX",35,255,50.0,1.0,2012-04-08,I rarely give one star.  Check if you don't believe me.  I have eaten at this place a half dozen times because it's close and my boy likes the potato skins. TGI Fridays constantly underwhelms me with their food.  I haven't found a dish I'd order again yet.  I consistently get less than attentive service.  Maybe they are understaffed or maybe they aren't wearing enough flair.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lewisville?start=40,2.7880000000000003,2.7880000000000003,2.7880000000000003,2.7880000000000003,2.7880000000000003
54,Jersey J.,"Wylie, TX",26,37,11.0,1.0,2012-08-28,"This review is for this location only. I have been to Quite a few TGIFs in the past and I don't remember being unhappy at any of them. Wow where to start? We went as a small group (9 People) for drinks and dinner with some friends from out of town. Staff was friendly our waitress did not know the brands of liquor that was stocked in the bar which made it thought to order. We ordered shots and a think 6 margaritas one daiquiri. We finally got that worked out we got our drinks. The shots were large. We ordered our food and appetizers. We got the appetizers and they were OK, no complaints. A few of us need refills on margaritas so we reordered them. The waitress came back to the table and asked for our old glasses she told us there were no more glasses.( are you kidding me What would happen if the place is busy would we have to share glasses?) We are done with appetizers Just when you would think the food should be coming out the waitress came to the table and told me that were out of the dish I ordered. Why did they wait this long to tell me. So now I look threw the menu find some thing different. Man I was upset but did not make a big deal and ruin the mood at the table. The food took 10 mines or so more to come out but guess what mine was still a few minuets behind that. We got the food not so good. My chicken was like rubber. There was a steak that was not eaten and a pasta dish that was not eaten. The guy with the stake voiced hid displeasure and it was removed from the check. I would not go back to this location even if they offered free food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lewisville?start=40,2.9160000000000004,2.9160000000000004,2.9160000000000004,2.9160000000000004,2.9160000000000004
48,Catherine P.,"Lewisville, TX",1,20,,5.0,2013-01-12,"Reading these reviews, I find it hard to believe I've been going to the same restaurant. My husband and I go here at least once a week, Brenda is consistently our server and she's FANTASTIC. Our food has never been messed up or forgotten, if they are out of something (which i think only happened once) she knew and informed us before we ordered. Our food comes out fast even on a busy Friday night, drinks are promptly refilled, a manager almost always stops by to ask how our meal is.  Maybe the place is under new management or has made positive changes after reading reviews left here, but I can't think of one reason to give anything less than a 5 star rating.   We usually get the ""pick 2 for 10"" you get an appetizer and entree for $10 - I've tried most of the items available with that deal, the pot stickers are great, the BBQ chicken flat bread is a favorite too.  Hubby loves the Korean beef tacos and the pulled pork sand which, the chicken parm is good, I wasn't a fan of the bruschetta chicken but that had nothing to do with the quality of the food - simply my taste preferences.  The last few times I've been, the women's bathroom smells a little like sewage. It's not a deal breaker though, I just make sure I dont have a reason to use it before I eat. the Hubby ensures me the mens room is clean and odor free though.   The food is better than most chain eateries, in my opinion, has tons of flavor and doesn't taste like pre-made standard dishes from Costco or something, theres definitely better mom and pop type food out there, but Friday's is a go-to for us if we dont feel like cooking, and want a good meal, great service, and pleasant atmosphere.   ALSO - they don't advertise it much but if you join the ""give me more stripes"" club - from their website, you get a free dessert or app, and everytime you come in you get free chips and salsa or potato chips - you earn points for every dollar spent and can redeem them for various rewards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lewisville?start=40,3.4440000000000004,3.4440000000000004,3.4440000000000004,3.4440000000000004,3.4440000000000004

I dare not forget to mention the odor most closely associated with that of an unkept dog house that continuously greeted us at the table.  After speaking to the manager, it was as though we were out of line for being offended to pay for dinner with the stinky ""service"" Chihuahua who visits more often than we do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lewisville?start=60,2.8840000000000003,2.8840000000000003,2.8840000000000003,2.8840000000000003,2.8840000000000003

We walked in during dinner time which was around 6pm thinking maybe the food would taste better. But damn! I was wrong. Our server was cracked out, I could barely hear what she was saying and when she spoke it was like 100 mph. When we asked her about specials she told us to look at the book. You as a server, should know the specials. Anyways, we ordered our food. It tasted horrible.

We had a really long day and wanted to celebrate over cocktails and light bites. We made our way to the bar and were greeted kindly by a young man. He recited the happy hour specials and went on his way to grab us our first round of drinks.  Taste & Share menu sounded appetizing we ordered: Ahi Tuna Strips - Good. Not the best piece of Ahi I've ever had but the flavors were nice together. Would have preferred the crispy part would be more stable. It was hard to eat bite by bite. Bacon Mac & Cheese Bites - It's breaded on the outside. If you like melty gooey cheese, this is for you. I didn't like this very much because it reminded me of nachos. I'm not a nacho cheese fan. Corned Beef & Swiss Sliders - Pretzel bun with corned beef. It's gooood. Probably my fav dish because everything tasted good together. I didn't have to pick anything out. Parmesan Meatballs - The meatballs were coated with bread crumbs. Kind of run of the mill and nothing really to it. Chicken Skewers - Standard. Nothing special. Thai Pork Tacos - The slaw was my favorite thing. I can't handle spicy stuff. There were too many flavors going on in this for me to thoroughly appreciate it :T The next time you're thinking, ""Hey, I want to go somewhere for a late night happy hour"" try Friday's. I feel like they've really stepped up their game. This location had top notch staff working on a Friday night too.

Thursday's are pretty bumpin' here at Friday's...that felt weird to say, but it's true! They have awesome deals on cocktails and appetizers on Thursday nights, as well as a really cool DJ who plays nothin' but oldies & goodies. You can text him requests too, so if you wanted to here Nelly AND Missy Elliot like I did, he's got you covered.  The lady and I sat at the bar and were taken care of very well by two lovely bartenders. Both ladies were polite, and kept an eye on my drink often, making sure I didn't go thirsty last night. Much appreciated.  The fried mozzarella sticks were fantastic. Better than anything I had back in Jr. High, and we all know, cafeteria food was hard to beat... I finished the night with a Pecan-Crusted Chicken Salad and a tall Angry Orchard to compliment it. It all went down lovely, and I left Friday's that night, full and satisfied.  You go, Glenn CoCo.

There nearly always is a deal on appetizers, drinks and food.  They have a wonderful rewards program and the food is very reasonably priced.  I find it hard to believe that you could not find something to your liking, and, even so, I am sure they would make it right if you were disappointed.

Thankfully we are honest people and corrected the bill back to Friday's favor.

My previous two visits have not been very good. We had issues with the waitress the first time. She got my order wrong and then almost yelled at me loudly for correcting her mistake. The hostess also heard it and apologized to us on our way out. I let it go, thinking it must have been an off day. We went back again for St. Patricks day. This time we ordered our favorite Long Island Ice tea and they had three bartenders and non of them knew how to make it. They tried three times and every time it tasted like a Margarita! Well it looks like they have revised the recipe and it no longer tastes the same. The service was also very slow and we had to wait almost 45 mins for a table since they were short staffed.

I figured Thursday would be no wait or very small crowd which it was very slow. When we arrived the door greater was not at the front door to great us. We had to wait almost 5 minutes till she showed up. When we were finally seated the waitress asked what we would like to drink. My wife ordered Diet Coke and I ordered Coke. When she returned she gave us the wrong drinks. No big deal. We noticed our waitress was walking around with another waiter. I assume he was in training or possibly she was in training. It appeared they were arguing between each other. Our waitress passed our table several times and not stopping to ask if we were ready to order. After waiting for 20 minutes the waitress and different male waiter came to our table. The male waiter asked if we were ready to order. I stated we were ready to order 20 minutes ago and we were not interested in ordering any food from them. At that point I decided if their waiters are not observent to their customers then the cook staff might be the same way. I did not want to risk getting sick on lack of concern. Seems like management or the owner of this location needs to have a good talk with the crew at this location. I've gone to this location several years ago and when it first opened. Something has gone wrong at this location. The caring and common decency has left this location and I'm afraid the only best thing to do is to turn off the stove and go home.

Once seated, we waited 10 minutes for as server to arrive, but no one showed up.

She quickly brought our drinks.  A few minutes later the people at the table next to us asked if we ordered potato skins.  I told her yes we did.  She handed an order of potato skins to me and said they must be ours as they didn't order potato skins.  Several minutes later they brought that table fried green beans which they also didn't order.  A little bit later a server brought us a larger order of potato skins. We refused the food as we had already eaten the smaller order.  Ten minutes more passed and they brought out our entree. One of my sides was missing and the guy said he would get it.  Shelby showed up a few minutes later and I told her I didn't get one my sides.  It took another 5 minutes to get it.

I was told no , which I thought was a bit strange for a Friday night. That should have been a big clue.  Got there to be told there was a 25min wait, which was fine as that gave us time to have a drink at the bar while we waited for the remainder of the group.  Turns out the wait was almost double the time.  Finally, we got to our table. Only half of our party had arrived  and some did not have any drinks.  Server greeted us and Said he would be right back. He didn't even ask if anyone wanted drinks. Anyway he reappeared 20mins later with water. We all wanted to try the unlimited $10 appetizers. So we put our order in and then he disappeared again.  He came back 15mins later with chips and salsa. In the meantime we decided it was faster to go to the actual bar and get out own drinks !  Our first round of appetizers arrived and we decided to instantly order the next round of appetizers. In the meantime the rest of the group arrived and were completely ignored by the server. They waited 20mins to even be acknowledged. That never happened. Needless to say we left immediately and went elsewhere to get food and drinks !  It appeared they only had 2 servers. We also saw Kicthen staff waiting on some tables.

I do have to say that our waiter did announce that he was newer. But why didn't his team help him. There was honestly only five or six tables with people in the whole place. Our drinks came 10 minutes after our food, I ordered unlimited appetizers as my meal, mistake we were there for two hours only got two refills. I would ask for a refill and I guess he would just forget, so I would ask again, then ask anyone passing by. I had to sit and watch everyone else eat their meals...with no food in front of me. Then my bbq chicken appetizer cane, the plate had sauce on it, but not much of the chicken. My mother in law said,I thought you got bbq chicken. I laughed and replied no I just got chicken tenders with sauce on the side. HA. The potatoes I got were wise than the box ones you get at home. I really was dissatisfied with my food, not to mention I left hungry cause I couldn't get any when I asked for it. On the flip side my wife's Cajun pasta was tasty, looked ugly, but it tasted good. My wife couldn't eat it though it was too spicy, so I got the left overs the next day. The kids meals were ok. Except that the fries were drenched in pepper, weird. My mother and father in law didn't say much about their food, but my father in laws salad looked good. Wish I had ordered that.
