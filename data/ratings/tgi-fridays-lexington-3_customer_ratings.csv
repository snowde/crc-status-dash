24,Elisha R.,"Berea, KY",0,21,,4.0,2014-10-04,We are regulars at this TGI Fridays and of course the food is not 5 star quality dining they usually do pretty good at our dishes. We may be bias to this location because we stop in fairly regularly so they know us fairly well but even from the first few visits we were treated great. There have been a few instances when the food wasn't quite on par or there was a new waiter or waitress who was new and not quite up on their game but that's easily overlooked since we are regulars.  I would recommend this place to anyone near by the mall looking for a nice hot dinner after a long day of shipping. Fridays is also great for their points reward system and after a few meals you can easily build up to get a free entree or desert of your choice. I have been to several other Fridays which disappointed even in Lexington but this is one to check out if you want a good quality.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lexington-3?start=20,2.032,2.032,2.032,2.032,2.032

The hostess recognized us from a ""career"" standpoint and said as much, which is considerably rude when we are trying to be ""regular"" customers.

14,Kristina P.,"Lexington, KY",34,99,22.0,3.0,2016-01-18,"This particular location of the popular chain used to be really hit-and-miss. It's location adjacent the mall no doubt means they have some really heavy traffic at times and the servers might get tired or things might run out, but often the food was overcooked and dry. My husband loves this place so a couple of times a year for some reason we don't go to the Hamburg location and instead are on this end of town. They seem to have improved at this location recently. The food has been hot and fresh. It's not mind-blowing food, but it is good TGIFriday's food. I've also noticed that the service has improved significantly. The waitstaff still seem like they have to cover too many tables, but they are more professional and attempt to be attentive. If I had to rate this place 2 years ago I would have given it 1 star, but in the last few months it has earned a solid 3.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lexington-3,,,,,

Last night I got the sizzling chicken, and the chicken had a odd texture and tasted odd. I hope I don't get sick. The meal was $14 and I had to spit out half of it because it was so fatty.

18,Cynthia L.,"Lexington, KY",1,2,,4.0,2016-01-30,"We really enjoy coming to this TGIF. The staff is always friend and the service is always exceptional. Today while waiting on our food, I believe, the manager, which had a blue shirt, screamed at a staff member, loud enough for everyone to hear ""Is this the way you train your staff!? To watch the tv!? Hu!? You just lost your job!"" How embarrassing this must be! As a local restaurant owner, this is definitely not something your customers would like to hear.

13,Stella P.,"Hazard, KY",15,79,4.0,1.0,2016-08-07,"So I originally had given this location four stars years ago. The last two times I have been to Friday's at this location, services has been awful. Yesterday my husband and I sat for 20 minutes at a table while a server floated about from tables all around us, we were ignored. Our drink orders were not taken, we were not acknowledged at all.

12,Kelly S.,"Georgetown, KY",28,15,19.0,1.0,2016-11-05,"As others have stated: Listen to the reviews! I normally enjoy Fridays, and visit the Hamburg location here in Lexington. The 474 menu affords me a cheaper option to enjoy the Jack Daniels chicken that I really enjoy. This is the entree that both people in my party ordered today and it was sadly lacking. The chicken was severely dry and the complete underside was burnt. To compensate the fish was drowned in JD sauce which did nothing but accentuate the charred dish.  In addition to the poor food quality we also had service issues making the entire visit a total flop. We waited far too long for our order to be taken and once we were being helped getting drinks was a hassle.  Spend your hard earned dollars at another Lexington spot and pass on this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lexington-3,,,,,

5,David G.,"Lexington, KY",65,151,177.0,3.0,2017-04-23,"They're trying. I'll give them that. But they don't totally have it together service-wise. The wait time. It's a long time. I started believing the reason it was called TGI Fridays is because I was ordering on a Sunday and might have to wait until Friday to get my meal. But it finally came. Just be ready for a stay and nurse your drink...it might be awhile before you get a refill. Once the food came I was pleasantly surprised. I went with a Buffalo Wingman's Burger. It's a very unique and original burger, bizarre on a certain level (they put buffalo wings on top of it), but it somehow pulls it together. I'd recommend. The wings are kinda like a mini-appetizer before you get to the burger. The burger itself was tasty and spicy, and I enjoyed the pimento cheese they put on it. The fries were pretty good as well. My wife ordered the ribs. They are pretty good. They were half price the day I was there. Definitely worth the $12 promotional price. Not sure about paying $24 for them, though. But again, service lagged in this area. She ordered a side of mashed potatoes and broccoli. The server came out and said, ""They gave you a side of fries...is that ok?"" Very strange. Just fix it, right?  I really like the mini burgers on the kid's menu. If you have kids who order burgers, it's always a pain having to cut it into quarters for them. The minis are a good solution to this problem. I ended up having a problem with the bill (another service issue), but we spoke to a manager who was very kind, helpful, and pragmatic who solved the problem for us. Again, they're trying, but they don't seem to be firing on all cylinders.  To sum it up, the food was pretty good. I'd go back. But I'm hoping they solve some of the service related issues that I had and many of the previous Yelpers apparently had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lexington-3,,,,,

2,Lacy S.,"Lexington, KY",2,17,,1.0,2017-08-01,"I typically enjoy Fridays but as the other reviews have stated the service was the poorest I've had in some time. We requested to be seated on the patio. This was a Monday night so there was only one other table on the patio. However, there were at least 3 tables that had not been cleared off and were not until they got busier towards the end of our meal. We didn't have our drink order taken for around 15 minutes. I had the Margarita which was very tasty but had to ask for a water 3 times and we never received refills. My boyfriend ordered an appetizer of wings and I ordered the french onion soup and then we both ordered salads for our entrees. The server came back to confirm our order twice. It took a while to get our food but we weren't in a hurry and it was a pleasant night. Everything came out together (not my favorite thing but a minor inconvenience) except my soup. I asked for some additional dressing as there was hardly any with the salad and my soup - my boyfriend asked for ranch for his wings like he originally ordered (the server confirmed this twice when taking the order too). The server returned several minutes later with just one dressing for my boyfriend. I asked again for some dressing and waited several more minutes to eat. The soup came out about 20 minutes after my meal - at which point I didn't want it any longer. We then waited about 20 minutes for our sever to pick up our check.  The sad thing is the food was really tasty. The cobb salad was great and fresh and the french onion soup was nice. The bbq chicken salad was also very good. I would give the food 3.5 stars. The service was just so bad that we won't be returning which is a shame given the good food for a decent value.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lexington-3,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08

I get the Cajun Chicken and Shrimp Pasta. More sauce than anything which gives the plate the illusion that it's a full plate when it's not. Also no spicy as you would assume for a Cajun dish. I suppose that's what you get for an American Restaurant. Anyways...it was ok for the price, clean and they have friendly servers...or at least ours was.  I'm retracting my first 4 stars!

0,James R.,"Northside District, Lexington, KY",19,7,11.0,4.0,2018-01-07,"Decided to brave the cold this evening and head out to TGIF near Fayette Mall. I must say, this is a slightly different set up and atmosphere from the TGIF in Hamburg. Either way, the menu still has lots of selection from which to choose. Pouring over the menu I settled on French onion soup, fries and pretzel sticks. Food came out relatively quickly. I started with the fries, which were pretty good honestly. They were seasoned, hot and very fresh. I then moved over to the pretzel sticks. They were great as well. Lots of salt though, which coupled with the salt in the beer cheese dipping sauce was a lot. I scraped some of the salt off and then enjoyed the rest of the pretzel sticks. I then had the French onion soup, again, really good just salty. It's like, I know all of this stuff comes frozen and is basically assembled in the back, but still there's a lot of salt. None the less.  Our waiter provided great service. I would definitely recommend this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lexington-3,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
