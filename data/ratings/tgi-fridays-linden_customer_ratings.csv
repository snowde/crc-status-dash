62,Diamond G.,"Elizabeth, NJ",2,16,35.0,5.0,2012-04-13,"Ok so this is my absolute favorite american food chain restaurant! Ever!  The ambiance is fun, alot of cool things to look at. You can sit in the bar area or in the dining area.. Every sunday its happy hr & half price appetizers, & every other day after 10pm.  $5 big ass margarita- $6 for a better tequila. The bar is good to watch some sports.  The food is always good. Its typical american- yet always consistent. The appetizers (especially the wings) are my all time favorite.  Service has always been great (unless its really busy- but that's like any place). Friendly staff. Ohh and sign up for their email rewards. So worth it. Buy one meal get one free & more..

31,Gina L.,"Elizabeth, NJ",145,105,125.0,4.0,2012-04-15,I personally just don't care for Fridays.  To me the food is over rated and it is just so chainy.  But my hub ad kids really like it here.  Fridays is picky eater heaven.  They do offer a variety of American cuisine classics.  When we go I always get the JD chicken strips or a burger.  I get way too nervous to chance the seafood options.  The shrimp look good but I've had my share of bad experiences with shrimp.  I'll pass.  I'll take a giant Mojito though.  I already know to mention making it extra strong.  You have to say this because the drinks are made watered down.  They really can suck if you do not ask for a really stiff drink in which you will get a regular drink. I give 4 stars on behalf of my family who is here telling me to give it 5.  It is close to my home and we can walk there.  It s right by a bowling alley which makes for a good family fun night.  And when I leave I look back at my happy and stuffed family and feel good about coming here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-linden?start=40,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416

Well, to me TGI Friday is like a higher level of fast food My friend and I went there for early dinner, it was around 5pm, so it wasn't that busy.  We sat down, and the waiter came by and said ""Hello my friend""  I personally don't like the greeting, because I am there as a customer, not his friend.  But like I said before, higher level of fast food. lol  So I didn't say anything, and I placed my orders.  I ordered the New England Clam Chowder, follow by the Half Rack Ribs and the Lobster.  Meh....it was really Meh. I've experienced better.  The Ribs is too dry, so is the lobster Oh...well, I should know better, not really going for the food anyway, my friend wanted to go there.

After a long ass day of errands (Ikea, Sams, Target) we figure we would keep in the spirit of chains and go to TGI Fridays.  Actually, it was the only thing near by and we were starving.  But we got there around 4 on Saturday and was glad to see it was happy hour - on a weekend. We got huge draft beers for only $3 each.  Yup $3 each. All of their apps were half off so we chowed down - and they were pretty damn good.  The gals who worked there were great, quick and really friendly. And the restaurant seemed pretty new and clean - so that was nice. So for a nice break between your errands on a Saturday afternoon, and  your starving and don't give a shit where you eat - this is a great spot.

We ordered them medium rare but when the waiter brought them out they were very dry and overdone, and the Jack Daniels burger was missing the sauce.  Luckily when we told the waiter, he immediately brought over the manager, who took the burgers back to the kitchen and even convinced me to have mine redone (even though I was willing to eat it).

65,Cindy B.,"Elizabeth, NJ",42,2,7.0,1.0,2014-08-08,"The worst TGI Fridays I have EVER been to!  I went with two other people on a  Wed night. This was closest one to my house and my friend had a gift card, he wanted to treat us. Just came from work, professional looking at least I thought so and since I wasn't paying I grabbed my ID, a credit card (just in case) and my keys.  We all got there, sat at the bar and ordered our drinks, the bartender asked us for ID.  I took mine out my pocket and I accidentally grabbed the expired driver license (oops_) It was a month old but that's besides the point.  The bartender said, ""this is expired!"" ( I didn't know these bartenders were part time cops)  I said , I know it was an honest mistake but my DOB is on there, stating I am 35 YEARS OLD. She  told me rudely that she will have to speak with her manager.  She then brought the drinks for everyone there with me and then spoke out loudly, I CANNOT SERVE YOU ALCOHOL would like a soda?  I thought to myself, do I look like a pepsi drinking kind of girl? I then had to have one of my friends leave her drink (side note_-the ice never melted in the alcoholic drink)  and drive me home 10 mins to get my valid ID to show the bartender/part time cop that all is well with me and the department of motor vehicles. (How bout them apples??) Still yet to see the manager who never came over to say.. well anything.  Geez I know it's a chain restaurant  but a little professionalism goes a long way.  By this time I was famished so I figured since she made the worse drinks ( I should of asked for her valid mixology license) .. I would just get an $11 (ish) salad cause ya can't really mess up a salad?  Or Can ya? The most salty Yucatan chipotle chicken salad ever and I think someone ate some of my chicken before I got it, I saw like a strip. With that said, I WILL NEVER EVER EAT THERE AGAIN! She is lucky I didn't pay the bill cause well here's a TIP for ya!! My people still 15% her.  At the end of the day.. it was all about ""class.""

Came in noticed it was happy hour, was only 3 of us so instead of getting a booth we opted for the bar area. As soon as we sat down it seemed the barmaid was annoyed that she had to wait on us. I got the happy hour Ultimate Margarita, a friend proceeded to get the Sangria & when she asked if it was included with happy hour the barmaid got an attitude ""No, do you still want it""? My friend didn't want to appear cheap so she said yeah. After ordering our drinks, the food took an additional 20-minutes for what IDK.... After sitting there for about a good 15 minutes into our meals/drinks she just left us and proceeded to pretend to clean the bar area and make drinks for someone else so another waitress had to attend to us.

Yes there appetizers are frozen, then deep fried and brought to your table, but they taste sooooo good.  The pros are: you come during happy hour and appetizers are 50% off, they have low calorie options and there cocktails give you the sting you need :) The cons: the waiters here need a little more training.

67,Phillip P.,"Linden, NJ",0,30,1.0,1.0,2015-06-11,"What happens to ""chain"" restaurants after they open in Linden ? All is well for a week or two and then all bets are off. Standards go downhill quickly. Food quality , service,and cleanliness all suffer. This is most definitely the case with Fridays in Linden. Their bar transgressions are well documented. The lax attitude of a management team that turns a blind eye to a rude clientelle and turns a place that should be family friendly into anything but is obvious. The turnover of personnel is constant with each new group being worse than the previous one. Orders are almost always incorrect and never really corrected. Food is presented in such a careless , unappealing manner. Service is notoriously bad. Servers here have mastered the art of being overly intrusive untill it's time for your check .By then you better start checking milk cartons because they're nowhere to be found. Last but not least-can common sense make an occasional appearance here? Does a 55 year old woman really need her ID to order a drink ? To be denied service for such a thing is an absolute and total joke. Just because you tried to scam customers with low quality booze in top shelf bottles and got caught doesn't mean you need to have contempt for the customer. It's only gonna get worse.

We were minding our own business and didn't deserve to be degraded in such a manor. Everyone else seemed to receive there food on time except us.

I can't say too much about the decor. It seems one step above the BWW ""hose-it-off-when-you're-done"" interior, but I guess it was fairly comfortable.

I came for lunch for my organization's meeting and it was not crowded. A few of us came and we decided to order with our waiter, Les (I believe was his name). I ordered the Mahi Mahi Naan'Which with a Caesar salad along with water and lemon. After twenty two minutes, I had to ask for my drink.  A table of 4 sitting behind us came after we were there for 20 minutes and ordered. Food from our table came after 30 minutes (sizzling chicken and shrimp, drinks). My friend received her Mahi Mahi Naan'Which order in and after eating it, realized it was my order except she wanted spinach (as opposed to a salad). I was fine with it because I assumed her order would be next. More of my friends came and received their orders immediately, along with the table behind us so I inquired about my order. Les (with a condescending tone) said my food was out so I have to wait. I honestly wanted to curse him out but because of my meeting I decided not to (but I did privately with my friends). I finally received my food (which was almost 50 minutes).  Luckily, my sister paid for me because if it was up to me, I would not have left a tip for that jackass.

To start, I won't give any chains 5 stars, so we begin with 4.  Things this place it has against it: the service is spotty at times, it took a good 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge me. Despite the fact that the menu says they have local craft beer, they did not. The menu is a little on the pricy side, everything about $2 more than the fair price. $6.50 is not the right price for a small Caesar salad- $4.50 would be a more reasonable price. The $14 chicken sandwich should be $12... you get the idea.  They also advertise through posters in the lobby to download the rewards app- which doesn't work at this location since they're not a corporate store. Very confusing. Minus 2 stars.  To their credit, they do have a slightly above average beer selection, the menu is a level above a typical chain restaurant, the restaurant is newly renovated, and once you can get the attention of a server, you do get pretty good service.

This is a chain restaurant, but that does not mean they should not have pride in how/what they serve and not have quality at the center of their operation. Came on a Wed night for a school fundraiser. They were not busy. Well, the table areas were not busy, the bar area was where all the action took place. Took 10 minutes for the hostess to come acknowledge myself and 2 other small parties like mine. After that, another 7-8 minutes for our server to come take out order. Asked what was on tap, waitress shrugged her shoulders and said she didn't know. I asked for an Oktoberfest, as I figured it was seasonal and every place had it. That took 15 minutes for the server to come back yo notify me that they were waiting for pint glasses to come out of the dishwasher to pour my beer (???).  Another 6-7 minutes later, the waitress came back to bring my bowl of soup which came out before my child's order which had been placed 20 minutes before. At that point I asked for my beer order to be cancelled. Granted, once my child's order came out, a pint of Oktoberfest came on the house. I appreciate the damage control, but at this point I was very frustrated and appalled at the lack of service. I have been here for close to 1 hour, and the large table next to us remains with all the dirty plates and utensils piled up.

Last time here. Two stars because my son liked his burger and so did my husband.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-linden,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88
48,Andre M.,"Linden, NJ",2,3,,2.0,2017-11-07,Do not waste your time or money here! Ordered one of the most expensive steaks on the menu and although I know this isn't a steak house the quality of meat that was served was TERRIBLE!!! I never complain but there was no meat in the steak it was mostly all fat. I told the waiter and he seemed too busy to be bothered. Also never got refills on my drink.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-linden,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002
52,Quanice M.,"Bloomfield, NJ",53,1,,1.0,2017-11-11,It was no one in the front to take are seating had to walk back to ask no one welcomed us just walked past. Two waitresses was arguing about the seating in front of customers. My steak was hard and taste burnt. Rest of my dish was good. Also the waitress need to write down what we order cause they messed up an order. If I can give negative stars I Would won't be coming back here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-linden,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002
