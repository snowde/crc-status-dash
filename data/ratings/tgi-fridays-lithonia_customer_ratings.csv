Friday's!  I fell in love with their Jack Daniel's sauce years ago and haven't been able to shake my craving since.   I met a friend at the Stonecrest location for dinner Friday night.  They were pretty packed, but we were seated within minutes.  The service was very good, too.  Our waitress was  friendly, attentive  and good about recommending items on the menu!  This is rare when you go to places like this and are packed from wall to wall.   The food was really good, as always.  If you decide to go, I would try the Tropical Mojito!  I'm not a big drinker, but I ended up having two of these!  It went down easy, had the right amount of liquor, and the right amount of sweetness to make this amateur drinker order another round!    If you're a sports fan, they have TVs almost everywhere and someone at the bar ""rings a bell"" anytime your favorite team scores.   Overall, the ambiance of this location was a lot of fun, their staff is friendly and focused on making sure you enjoy your dining experience, and the food and drinks are consistently good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lithonia?start=60,2.288,2.288,2.288,2.288,2.2880000000000003

46,Kelly v.,"Hanahan, SC",27,58,14.0,2.0,2013-05-26,"I visited this place twice. I went on a Saturday for lunch with a friend. The waitress seemed new and forgetful but extremely nice. I ordered their version of tuna a mahi tuna crisp (I believe is the name), macaroni and cheese bites, and meatballs. The mahi tuna crisp was horrible. I guess the word for that plate was bland. The macaroni/cheese bites, and meatballs were great but a bit over priced if you ask me. Regardless I enjoyed lunch so much I went back Sunday evening with my mate. We sat at the bar and I ordered meatballs, pork wontons, and macaroni and cheese bites. I loved the macaroni/cheese bites, my favorite item on the menu. The problem was the waitress, who only took our orders and brought the food. after eating the meal the plan was to relax and have some drinks, the waitress basically forgot we existed. I understood that it was a busy night so I waited about 15 minutes quietly. Many of the other passing waitresses looked at my party and I realizing we were waiting for service but looked away quickly not wanting to be bothered by helping paying customers I assumed. After becoming impatient I started waving at my waitress who was only 15 feet away from me, but apparently that wasn't enough because she still ignored me. I became so angry I told my mate I was not planning to spend another minute at the venue waiting for service, and I refused to spend any more of my money just to be ignored. I took out my debit card and raised my arm and in a blink my waitress came to my aid...REALLY!?!?!? I usually leave an above average tip but with no service I paid what I owed and left 000 accross the tip line. The macaroni/cheese bites are not worth the service from TGIF.

The hostess and servers are friendly, but you will WAIT on your food, or it will be COLD or it will be WRONG. My Husband and I went to TGI Fridays at Stonecrest and we found a great parking space and figured this was the 1st sign of a great experience. Well that was about the only indicator.  We were seated by a very friendly host and after that it went down hill. Our server came over and greeted us then took our drink orders.  The turnaround time for that was timely.  We put in an appetizer order and our main entrees order. Then we proceeded to wait about 1.5 hours and during that time, my husband commented that he observed a lot of folks waiting on food or sending it back because it was wrong or cold. Eventually our server kept checking in with us during the long wait and she finally said they were backed up in the kitchen.  Well by that time my husband and I were famished and couldn't wait. so we paid for our beverages and left.

Don't order the ""BFM"" margarita or whatever it's called because for the price of that little drink you can go with the ultimate margarita instead.

Again NOT CROWDED and no special order, no steak, no special dietary needs, no add this or take that, just basics. When the food was about to come, our waitress/bartender tells us on the way out somebody ran into somebody with the entrance door to the kitchen. If you didnt know, restaurants like this have an IN ONLY & EXIT ONLY door JUST for this reason. Most places wont have a door at all also to prevent this.  This caused another 40 minutes to be added to our wait time. Before you ask why I didnt leave at that point its because my date wanted to stay though I was highly opposed to it, I only gave in for medical issues she has. The last straw was bringing the wrong thing out, the waitress/bartender not being anywhere to be seen most of the visit for me to even tell her i wanted to leave sooner (still had to pay for drinks). Then for compensation I was offered chips & salsa (I hate salsa but was told they dont have queso). Then I was told finally my bill would be reduced. At this point money or not I did have other things to do. Oh and dont get me started on the fact the reason we came was for the unlimited apps but they're not corporate so blah blah.

We (husband, daughter, and myself) all ordered our entrées at the same time, my daughter and I ordered the same exact meal but the server helping out only brought out 2 of our entrées, not even the two that were the same. One of our meals was missing the shrimp, I had to wave someone down to ask about it and was told that the kitchen was backed up and they were working on getting the shrimp out to me....why wasn't that mentioned when the food was brought out? I shouldn't have to wave somone down to find out that info.! We didn't get the third entree until about another 20 mins. later, during that time I did not want my family to wait to eat so at this point my family is half way through their meal when we get the third entrée. The  missing shrimp didn't get to the table until after the third entrée was delivered, at least 20 mins. after the meal that the shrimp goes with was brought to the table, just ridiculous!

Extra napkins never got to our table until we asked the manager for them after she never bought them back like she said she would. As a place that we have come to and had GREAT SERVICE.

My Husband ordered the ""really good cheese burger"" with sweet potato fries, I ordered the shrimp naan/flat bread sandwich, and a chicken quesadilla for the app.  The appetizer came out after 15 min.  It tasted really good, very flavorful, and hot.  There was a watery glob of sour cream and LITERALLY a teaspoon of pico and looked like some day old dark brown guacamole. It tasted awesome though.   My husband's burger and my shrimp naan was brought out about 30 minutes after our appetizer.  They were out of sweet potato fries, so the server made the decision to give my husband regular fries without asking if he wanted a side salad, or anything else.   He ordered his burger medium, it was well done.  My shrimp naan was a weird mix of good and bad.  The thing that ruined it was that the naan bread was burnt.  They smeared the burnt crispy side with cucumber dressing.  The cucumber dressing was good, and it had loads of garlic, but again the burnt taste overpowered everything. It was hard to hold like a wrap because it was so crispy.  Shrimp were plentiful, I didn't see a lick of balsamic glaze.  Alot of people I know love TGI Fridays, but I honestly was not impressed.  Oh...my fries were good.  Our server never refilled our waters, another server did.   As we walked out we saw that THEY HAVE A 74C HEALTH SCORE.  ONE OF THE VIOLATIONS WAS FOOD NOT BEING HELD OR SERVED AT PROPER TEMPERATURES.   Bathrooms were clean.   As long as it took to get our food, I'd be afraid to eat here on a weekend night.   Wont be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lithonia?start=20,2.04,2.04,2.04,2.12,2.04

First of all we were told there was no seating so we went to the bar but since there was plenty of seating near the bar we sat at a table unassisted. My son ordered a burger and fries. I ordered a salad. My sons order was cold though the cold fry tasted like it could be good if hot and I was impressed with the quality and taste of his hamburger bun it was just cold. I thought to myself hmm I'm going to visit another TGIF they might have good food. Soooo I ordered a salad and the waitress sets it down with a nasty look. I kid you not by the time I finished with that salad a had a blister on my tongue and was swearing up and down they gave me herpes. I don't know what they gave me but it caused a blister so I don't go there.

My waitress was nice but I can't the way this place is ran.  My hubby and I had a 20 minute wait which was fine because it was Saturday and it was late.  I couldn't access my account so he decided to get a rewards account.  Immediately after signing up, he received an offer for a free appetizer or a desert. We told our server immediately and she said it was fine. Actually we ordered our appetizer and food at the exact same time so there would be no issues.  Our appetizer came out quickly which was great.  We had to eat with our hands because our waitress after asking 3x forgot our silverware, but that was fine since it was onion rings. Strike 1.  Our food, the ribs, took 45 minutes with no explanation as to why. Strike 2.  After the THIRD time asking which I started showing how annoyed I was, I finally got my silverware. But lo and behold, there was food on my fork and on my husbands knife. Not only that but I couldn't find my waitress and had to walk to the bar who only had 1. I had to go really close to the kitchen area to find my waitress and to get it.  But my annoyance and what really pissed me off was the fact that the ribs are considered a promo and cant be combined with the free appetizer. There was no way anyone could override it from what I was told. Strike 3.  This visit was utter and complete b.s. I am beyond disgusted that this restaurant still hasnt gotten together.

I am a veteran and today is Veterans Day.  TGIFriday's had a special menu just for the veterans today, so my boyfriend and I decided to meet with his friend here and we were going to have a good meal here among us 3 veterans.... or so I thought! When we got there it was extremely packed, so I put our names on the waiting list. I was told it would be a 30 to 35 minute wait. I was already really hungry, but we decided to eat there anyway because I told my boyfriend what a great restaurant this was. We waited in the car and I checked after 25 minutes just to see where we were on the list. There was a different hostess at the stand and she informed me it would be another 20 minutes. I told her that would put us at a 45 minute wait when we were originally told 30 minutes. She just kind of shrugged me off saying ""we're waiting for other tables to open up"". So I return to the car to wait.  Not even 10 minutes had gone by, and I'm extremely hungry at this point, so I'm thinking we could just go stand by the door to wait. When I looked at the waiting list, our names were scratched out!  I then asked her why she skipped us and she shrugs me off again, saying ""we called on y'all 2 times a long time ago."" I told her ""you said 20 minutes more than 10 minutes ago!"" She said to me ""well, now it's an hour's wait.""

Even if you only go for a drink or two, I highly recommend it: Food: I get my usual sizzling chicken and shrimp when I come here and it always comes out sizzling just like it says. This time I decided to try something different, and got the Jack Daniels chicken and shrimp. Magnifique! I'm a picky eater, and usually when I find something I like I stick with it. It's worth sampling the menu here. You might be pleasantly surprised.  Drinks: I get alcohol whenever I come here. This location has drink ""specials"" nightly, no happy hour but good prices. Though it's not on the menu anymore, the bar still made my favorite blackberry martini drank. The dark and stormy and the Strawberry Hennessy cocktail is also delicious.  Parking: it gets crowded here, even on Mondays and the like. People come here to eat and enjoy the atmosphere so go early, spaces can be limited.  Service/Atmosphere: again, can't speak highly enough about the great atmosphere here. I will bypass other eateries that I really like in favor of this place. There is a DJ in the evenings, games upstairs and sports on the tv. I saw a kids' birthday gathering as well. Literally something for everyone but if ""fun"" isn't your thing then choose another location. This isn't your typical, quiet-ish TGIs. While wait times varied on the day I was there, the servers were always apologetic when ever I did have to wait long.
