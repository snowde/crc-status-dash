28,Rachel K.,"Phoenix, AZ",166,29,8.0,1.0,2013-03-03,"If someone is asking you for your list of salad dressings, do NOT have a conversation that goes like this: -Customer: ""What kind of salad dressings do you have?""  -Waitress: ""Well what do you want?""  -Customer: ""Well what kind do you have?""  -Waitress: ""Well, we have a lot, and if I go through the whole list and you don't pick one, I'm going to very upset.""  Okay, WHO SAYS THAT? THE CUSTOMER DOES NOT WORK HERE; HE DOESN'T KNOW THE WHOLE COMPLETE ""LONG LIST OF DRESSINGS"" THE RESTAURANT PROVIDES. IF YOU'RE TIRED OF REPEATING YOURSELF, GET ANOTHER JOB. YOU DO NOT NEED TO BE RUDE TO THE CUSTOMER BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONE WHO IS SICK OF SAYING WHAT DRESSINGS YOU HAVE. Completely unprofessional, incredibly rude, and I am disgusted. If I ever have you as a waitress again I will request someone else. Your work ethic is the reason why I am so against to ""HAVING"" to tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-livonia,,,,,
26,Scott K.,"Ann Arbor, MI",120,86,82.0,1.0,2013-03-05,"You're probably thinking, what did you expect?  I used to go to Friday's all the time, but many years have passed.  I received a coupon in the mail - why not give it a go? We ordered a sirloin/shrimp combo and a flatiron steak with parmesan fries and a house salad.  Let's start with the good things: The shrimp were great, and the parmesan fries were strange but pretty good, with a tanginess I didn't expect. The waitress was kind but confused.  My salad came one minute before our steaks, so I pretended to be european and ate it last.  Hup hup, cheerio guv'nor.  My medium flatiron steak came browned through and through - a desert wasteland of shoe-leather 'flavor'. My wife's sirloin seemed like it was the wrong size... which it was, because it was a flatiron, as our receipt later indicated.  It came medium when she ordered medium-rare, because unlike myself she likes the taste of blood and luke-warm muscles.  What she got was slightly pink, hot beef muscle. The wait staff asked if we wanted to talk to the manager when we pointed out the problems and I demurred, because I'm friendly and foolish. We gave her our coupon and she went away for awhile, coming back with a brand spankin' new receipt with the same ol' price as before.  Wait a tic... She came back with the manager at that point, who explained how it'd take a little while before the original price would disappear from my charge card... and didn't mention anything else.  Pretty sure he didn't realize this was just the last straw. The card we received in the mail had two more coupons on it for the month - I decided it was best used by giving it to the table behind us, because we're unlikely to return in 2013.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-livonia,,,,,
7,Anne C.,"Livonia, MI",0,4,,1.0,2013-03-28,Don't be fooled by the picture of the Jack Daniel's burger on the menu. What I got was a flat hamburger patty that came straight out of a bag. I would never go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-livonia?start=20,,,,,
0,Heather B.,"Redford Charter Township, MI",8,2,,1.0,2013-06-06,"Good is delish. Service is garbage. This waitress didn't even greet us with a ""hello"" just straight up ""can I get you some drinks?""... Then I ask a question about the menu and it gets answered and the chick walks away. I wasn't done talking. Our appetizer just came, still no silverware. Oh our salad is here now. Still no silverware. Finally got up to get our own silverware. They may have sensed our dissatisfaction because they overcompensated our entrées. Double mashed potatoes turned I to like quadruple mashed potatoes. OVERALL the service sucks and each time we visit we have yet to be provided professional service.  But the food is delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-livonia?start=20,,,,,
27,Ernie M.,"Northville, MI",42,396,58.0,2.0,2014-01-14,"We were here with a group of six and we have had better meals. I had the Friday shrimp and it was mostly dry breading. My wife got the spinach flat bread and liked it. Two of our friends ordered a cheeseburger, medium and they were both way too dry. Our server, Lauren F was very good, but the kitchen sent out our orders in a very strange way. First came the soups for the two who had ordered them. We then waited, and then came the flatbread appetizers for those who ordered them, and then we waited. Finally came my shrimp entrée and then the burgers and we ate them while everyone else waited. Strange. it may be a while before we get back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-livonia,,,,,

4,Gerry C.,"Plymouth Charter Township, MI",12,56,87.0,1.0,2014-02-23,"DO NOT EAT HERE.  If I could give this review NO stars I would. Small portions, terrible wait staff, waited 10 mins to sit down when there were tables open.  Waitress was terrible.  Took at least 25+ mins for our food.    And the food came out cold.  I got the mixed grill which was supposed to come with steak, chicken and shrimp with sautéed spinach and mushrooms and the size of the steak and chicken was ridiculously small.  You could finish it in one bite.  Spinach was raw and I didn't get any mushrooms.  The cooks here do not know how to cook.  Nothing is sautéed everything comes out raw and dry.  I asked to speak to a manager and he came out just confused and not really apologetic.  Offered something they already had sitting.  I was starving so I just ate it.  My experience was horrendous.  I will never go back here.  If you want TGI Fridays, go to the one in Canton because they are a corporate run location.  This location is a franchise and it's run verrrry poorly.  Trust me, you will not enjoy your meal. Save your money or spend it somewhere that will treat you better with better food.  I'd rather eat at Taco Bell down the street.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-livonia?start=20,,,,,

24,Eileen A.,"Westland, MI",42,148,147.0,3.0,2014-03-03,"I just happen to be in the area and wanted to be waited on and have an adult beverage. Let me start by saying it was a Monday at 2 pm when I went.  I ordered the Cobb salad. It was good, but I don't see how you could mess that up. Hence the reason for ordering it! I elected to sit at the bar. The bartender/waitress was ok. She had very little personality. She was more like a robot just going thru the motions. Took order, brought food, ask if it's ok, left the check & never asked if I wanted a refill on beverages. Like I said robot.  I'm not a big fan of Fridays anyway so I guess I won't be back unless all other restaurants are closed forever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-livonia,,,,,
1,John A.,"Novi, MI",19,67,45.0,4.0,2014-06-14,"Visit here occasionally, mainly because bar always has room to sit at it for a quick beer and appetizer. Bartenders are pleasant enough. Food is really good. It's a TGI Fridays, so the atmosphere is what you'd expect. Not much going on is usually the feeling I get. I'd prefer to give 3.5 rather than a 4. It's just above average. Not great, not bad. I'd recommend it for a beer and appetizer, but not to make a night out of it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-livonia?start=20,,,,,

22,Paul H.,"Hudson, OH",0,7,,2.0,2014-11-11,"Not the greatest experience I've ever had. Giving this location a second chance as first wasn't worthy of me hitting the keys. Sat down at the bar, stuck my hand in some goo on the bar so I'm all sticky. Got my beer, the high light of the night and a menu. After at least 10 minutes with my menu closed and sipping away my order got taken. Had a chicken Caesar salad and the dressing was horrible and it had tomatoes in it. I don't think I've ever had that before and it didn't enhance the experience.  With one sip left in my beer I was asked if I'd like another and decided I wouldn't although it could make the experience better. Er will see now how long to get my check. Not too bad after tossing my CC on the bar it looks like I'm out of here in a flash. Won't return for a third chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-livonia,,,,,

16,Charles W.,"South Lyon, MI",19,123,22.0,4.0,2015-01-10,"You know what your getting into at Friday's... typical chain frozen food with stupid crap hung up on the walls.  My wife seems to think they toned it down; however without turning my head I was able to see a billiard set, Gumby, drums, star trek enterprise, and a clone wars mask on the wall and no matter how I turned my head I couldn't catch a glimpse of  the football game.  I guess this is a family restaurant so they place an emphasis on families spending time with each other.   That's great to see in this day and age.  So often we forget the beauty in looking at souveniers no one wants as our children bury their heads in an iPhone.  It's times like these we should cherish as so easy they slip away from us :-P In all seriousness though I do enjoy their fries and chicken fingers.  Gotta substitute that tasty bbq sauce.  Their burgers are surprisingly good as well. I could see service being an issue.  We were seated and the manager noticed us not being helped so he told the servers.  It's nice they were on top of that.  To be fair we were waiting on someone but it would've been nice to have drinks.  Our waitress was very nice and attentive when we did get her. When it comes to typical chains all they have to do is provided good service and they did.  The food was as expected and I do enjoy the chicken finger comfort food.  I'm giving them 4 stars (4 chain restaurant stars, though yelp doesn't differentiate)  because everyone knows Friday's and they didn't screw anything up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-livonia,,,,,
15,Cristina B.,"Chesterfield, MI",260,137,65.0,3.0,2015-01-18,"The only real reason of my endeavor today was my man friend and I have a list of restaurants we want to go to together and TGI Friday's happened to be on there. Plus, we got the gift card from Kroger and got ourselves 100 extra fuel points (score!) Let me start out by saying the parking at this location is a mess, as is the cramped dining quarters. We arrived sometime around 5pm and the place itself was packed. I took this as a good sign of good food and solid service .... wrong.  The hostess seated my friend and I in the bar area at a two person tiny table that they somehow try to make available for parties of three. The table itself was squashed between a large party of 6 and another couple who thought it was acceptable to leave my friend and I absolutely no room to move our chairs. After telling my friend how much I dislike being seated in the bar area of most restaurants (too loud, bad service) we tried relocating to a real table. Except, of course, we couldn't flag down an employee or hostess.  So ..... we settled back into our cramped quarters. It took our waiter (who was actually quite kind) about 10 minutes to take our drink order and another 10 minutes to receive those drinks and more time again to take our order. My man decided on a burger of sorts and I settled on a turkey burger myself.  A server delivered our food in a rush, by throwing our plates on the table and having them slide around first. So rude! Never again did I see our waiter. Never was asked for an additional refill on water. Never was asked how our food was (burgers were mediocre and fries were bland unless loaded with condiments) and we waited for our bill for sometime.  Like i mentioned before, I was paying with a gift card. Our bill itself for two burgers and two waters was $20.03 -- not a horrible price but as a chain restaurant with bad service and bland food, it was disappointing. I'm not even sure if you are allowed to pay for tip with your gift card, but the receipt did show ""gift card charge"" below the tip section of the receipt so I went with it. Not that the never really seen waiter deserved his $4.97 tip, but it probably would've taken him another hour to return to  the table to answer my question. Long story short -- 3 stars. All for the food. Service is lacking and the fact that I saw countless parties waiting in the lobby as a left and just as I passed several emptied and messy tables -- it shows. Try one of the other restaurants nearby instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-livonia,,,,,
17,Jill H.,"South Lyon, MI",96,222,75.0,4.0,2015-01-25,"I normally wouldn't have chosen TGI for a Saturday night meal but I was on my way to the airport and it was a convenient choice for comfort food.  Over the years I've become used to Friday's taking their time and the following descriotion really isn't out of the ordinary but it all ended up to be an overall good experience.  We were immediately seated but waited sometime before anyone came to our table to acknowledge our presence. The manager looked like he was on his way out but noticed us a made sure someone came to our table right away. The service was great from there on out. Now, although we had reliable service I wasn't sure how much time the food would take so we ordered our food as soon as we had someone to take our drink orders.  The chicken fingers and seasoned fries were exactly what I had a taste for and came out within a decent window of time. It's always a reliable dish and exactly what I was craving, otherwise I should get my head checked for spending $11 on chicken fingers ;) Now, the portion wasn't anything overwhelming in fact, on my way out, I noticed that the kid's basket portion seemed to be about the same size. It was just piled in a basket as opposed to a fancy rectangular plate...but it won't stop me from ordering it again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-livonia,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36

14,Blaise B.,"Ann Arbor, MI",51,379,7.0,4.0,2015-03-29,"I think Friday's is my favorite of all the mid-level American chain restaurants, and for pretty much only one reason: the nachos. Order the nachos. They use chips that are basically half a taco shell, and actually put all the nacho toppings on each individual chip.  What a simple and ingenious idea! Their food is pretty standard.  Just like Applebee's, Chili's, etc. you always know what to expect, so if that's what you're going for Friday's is a good call.  Just be sure to order the nachos.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-livonia,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

We were sat at the booth directly behind the waiters podium, meaning that about every five minutes I would have a waiters butt hanging into my ""personal space bubble"".

During this time there were no drink refills. I ordered a steak for my entree cooked medium rare, it came out grey, tough and cold. The manager was nice enough to take the steak off my bill as I did not feel like taking an extra twenty minutes to see if they could make a new steak and make it right.

The bartender said she is new but very professional and friendly. Her service was amazing and struck up a little conversation to pass the time. After submitting my order my appetizer came out at 12 minutes 19 seconds which was the boneless hickory BBQ wings. The entree came out 14 minutes and 20 seconds later. I had the smokehouse stacked burger. Food was great, burger cooked well, nice and juicy and the sauce on the boneless wings I wish I could buy. Time was not to bad since they had a friendly bartender. I had 3 summer shandy beers which were on special for $4 for a 16 oz draft. Atmosphere is nice, clean facility, plenty of parking. Easy to access. All in all a great place. I cannot complain. I am not even from here but this is one of my favorite places so I go to them to rate the quality.
