23,Lydia Z.,"Lisle, IL",1,408,120.0,3.0,2012-03-28,"I remember when Fridays used to be the cool place to eat. Often we would wait for a table for 20-30 minutes. Fast forward 17 years. Today's Fridays is nothing special but I give them credit for trying. They keep trying to update their menu, at least cosmetically even if its the same food redressed in an effort to get people to come in. The food is average as we tried the petite steak and key west shrimp. The portions were small but that was fine. The service can be hit or miss but this visit it was good. It was a Tuesday evening and the place was empty. I bet they long for the good ol days when every night the place was hopping.

32,Keith K.,"New Lenox, IL",1,7,,1.0,2012-04-03,"I was conned into eating at TGIF the other day due to a very opinionated co-worker's birthday and needless to say I was not looking forward to it.  Nothing has ever impressed me about these restaurants, not the food, service or clientele; needless to say my opinion was not changed after this latest venture there. Recently I was put on a budget thanks to my newborn son and money-conscious wife so I knew my choices were going to be limited and I wouldn't be able to enjoy the only meal that seemed appealing and somewhat healthy to me - the sizzling chicken and cheese.  Going with the cheapest meal on the menu might have been a blessing in disguise.  While others were opting for the aforementioned sizzling chicken and cheese (some with shrimp - yum!), dragon stomach shrimp and rice mush I decided on the Southwestern Wedge Salad.  The server shockingly mocked me with a ""That's it?"" probably due to my girth but I assured her that the salad along with my glass of off-yellow water would be sufficient. The salad came out and I was actually impressed.  All the flavors blended well together and for $4.96 I was content; which is more than I can say about my co-workers choice words for their meals.  Some claimed their chicken was rubbery, others thought the rice was over-done and the birthday girl wanted everyone to know that her dog's droppings tasted better than her shrimp - the older ladies at the table next to us absolutely loved that one.  I have yet to find her review on here for Rufus' Dog Dropping Emporium though. The service was slow for it not being all that busy in the place and I really don't want to judge people on personal hygiene or appearance but I am going to.  It really seemed like the whole wait staff was very unkempt, so much so that one person wondered aloud if they were on some kind of work release program.  Shirts were untucked or faded, crumbs were everywhere, my portion of the table was sticky and don't forget the off-yellow water I mentioned earlier.  If it had been busier I could have let this slide a little bit but these people are handling my food and this is the condition of the places I could see, I can only imagine what the kitchen looked like... actually, I don't think I want to imagine that at all. Once the bill came we realized just how overpriced this underwhelming experience was.  Two positive notes though - the server did split the check amongst the six of us so I didn't have to pay anything toward the over-priced rubber meat and boxed mashed most people got and she did bring the birthday girl a sundae unasked.  Of course the B-Day Girl was very appreciative and responded loudly with, 'I don't eat effing ice cream, anybody want this ****?'.  Stay classy you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lombard?start=40,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.2440000000000007

When I first got inside the host looked out me like I had escaped from prison ( I have plenty of tatoos) then she said they couldnt sit us until 10 minutes. 60% of the tables were unoccupied so I asked why?? She said oh we dont have enough waiters although you can see that there were 2 weiters not even doing anything hiding at the corner. she said they didnt want their waiters to be ""overwhelmed"" As she was saying this i was begining to turn away until another host came to offer us a seat. this made that first host upset. Anyway when our meal was served it looked like it was scooped by a shovel and dumped in our plate. IThe taste was terrible! and it had bubbles it was just nasty but wats surprising about this experience is that the waitress came back 6 times and asked how the food tasted. and even said c'mon just be ""honest"" as if she knew sumthing.

34,Caroline K.,"Chicago, IL",0,4,,3.0,2013-09-28,"I'm a bit unsure of how to rate this place. I've been here pretty much since I was born--I used to love it so much, I came here each year for my birthday!  But now since I've grown up and that TGI Friday's has changed, so has my opinion on this restaurant. Let me start by stating that back in its glory days, the waits were out the door, the place was hopping, the food was perfect, the environment was fun, etc.  We always had nice waiters serve us and the food was delicious.  To put it simply, it was a treat for my family to dine here. After coming here last night with my boyfriend, I've finally, truly seen the difference.  While the decor has changed in appearance (obviously), so has its underlying spirit.  The food isn't quite as great as it used to be--the flavoring is ""good"" at best, but not ""great"".  However, it IS always fresh, so there's no worry about it being under/over-cooked.  Portion-wise, there's always enough food to fill you up!  For a while, the soda machine was malfunctioning, and my Coca-Colas were either flat or salty, so beware (just in case!).  The waiters are usually very nice about replacing a sour glass though, so that's good.  They also have a fair variety of dessert options which is nice. For the most part, the service has been good.  The drinks, appetizers, entrees, desserts, and checks come out at decent times; with the exception of last night, as our waiters changed three times, and our check came 20 minutes after we finished dessert.  The employees working there are nice and helpful, but they kind of seem like they're just there to work and that's it--not to please and serve their customers. I don't know if calling Friday's a ""hit-or-miss"" place is the right way to put it, but I'd say take a chance and enjoy it the best you can.  Visit on a day where your patience is at its best and your standards aren't at its highest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lombard?start=40,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.316,2.8

I've had it before in a glass cup and it's much prettier. There were also some strange chunks in it. I probably wouldn't order it again from this TGI Fridays.

We are going out for a family dinner, which for us is 7 people and 1 friend came along.  I sent our oldest kids (who are in their 20's) to get the table and we were a few minutes behind. When we walked in the girls are the only ones in the front of the restaurant and the had a pager in hand,  but there where several open tables!!! The hostess was very rude to them and myself stating ""they don't have anything available""!     - Please note is was at 7:20pm - We are sat at the table and drink orders were taken, all drinks come but 1 we reminded the server that we are still missing 1 lemonade and she said it would be right out, 5 minutes later the drink arrives.   we order (1) app & (2) come with the 2 for 10 so we had a total of 3 coming.  Again the waiting game began...Once the server returned we needed refills and asked what the delay was, she said I'm sorry the Kitchen is REALLY, REALLY SLOW RIGHT NOW, WE JUST WERE SLAMMED. Ok but they were not slammed now... apps come out and they also bring out my dinner which was a salad.  Guess what no sooner did the apps get there....here comes the meals!!!! All but 1 again (just like the drinks) it was a major dish to NOT!!! ...a wedge salad. so again we wait and wait and then the server returns...  - Please note now it is 8:30pm -  Still waiting for wedge salad !! FINALLY IT ARRIVES - I ask to see the manager on duty.  Server states he will be right out.... and again we wait.... now mind you the restaurant is now pretty dead.  5 minutes go by and the manager who comes to the table is laughing and grinning at me like we are nuts....  Really doesn't seem to take anything serious.  I said PLEASE UNDERSTAND THIS WAS TERRIBLE... THE FOOD WAS DRY AND OVER COOKED...And we do NOT want any free desserts because I are not waiting for them!!!! - please note now 8:55 pm -  Manager says I'll give you 20% off your bill too the WHOLE 3.00 OFF for the wedge salad... an card for free app, which he had a stack of in his pocket!   So, after we got our check .... and paid the still 79.00 bill after discounted 20%  we are walking out at 9:15!!!!!

50,Timothy H.,"Chicago, IL",171,226,69.0,1.0,2014-07-22,"This particular TGI Friday's has probably the worst service I have ever received, and they don't care about your credit card information. I stopped in with a friend recently on a Sunday evening.  When we arrived, the hostess told us (a part of two) that it would be almost a half hour but we could sit at and order from the bar.  We did that, and looked around at SEVERAL empty tables.  Maybe it would not have been a ""half hour wait"" if the host stand paid attention to what tables were available instead of having personal conversations about everyone that walked in the door.  But I digress..... The food was pretty decent this time, which was probably the only redeeming factor about this visit.  The chicken tenders were filling, as was the cheese sticks that I had. My major major concern was when it was time to pay for the check.  As someone who's credit card information has been compromised in the past, I am extremely careful.  Too bad the staff there couldn't care less.  The bartender took my card, laid it on top of the register IN PLAIN VIEW OF ANYONE, and then proceeds to WALK OFF, not just to the other side of the bar, but to the other side of the RESTAURANT.  Meanwhile my card is sitting on top of the register, begging for someone to copy my information down. I immediately looked for a manager.  The manager, Angie, when I told her about that, initially couldn't have cared less...and her body language (and ACTUAL language) said that.  But when I told her about my card being compromised before, she changed...slightly.  She then proceeds to take my dessert off of my bill.  When someone takes something OFF your bill, the amount should DECREASE.  Instead, it INCREASED.  She overcharged me. I called the restaurant back on Tuesday and asked for the General Manager, who (surprise, surprise!) was on ""vacation"".  The fill-in manager, Abel, proceeds to write down my credit card information AGAIN (the WHOLE number this time) and promises to call me back in an hour.  He didn't. I call the restaurant again and speak with ""Reggie"", who couldn't have been a manager, because the way he spoke to me was beyond disrespectful.  Finally I told him I would go through my bank to get the funds back because it was obvious that they didn't care, and he said ""they're not going to do anything"".  Dude, you don't know me, or my bank. If you enjoy piss poor service, being spoken to as if you are a child, and enjoy being overcharged by an inept staff that could care less, go here.  As for me, they never have to worry about me again. By the way, my Bank did give me back my money.  See TGI Friday's, you know nothing, my dear.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lombard?start=20,2.4,2.4,2.4,2.084,2.4

If you can't find something on their menu chances are you don't eat food.  Seriously, they've got a pretty fat menu that's really diverse.  There is something, as they say, for everyone.   We came in for an early dinner so I'm not sure if we ate off the lunch of dinner menu.  Regardless, I had a turkey club that was very tasty, and not gummed up with a shitload of sauce and garbage.  All the ingredients were very fresh.   Chose broccoli as my side and that too was very fresh and tasty.  Had the cheesecake for desert but also had a chance to see 3-4 other deserts.  If you're going for girth on your desert you'll want to grab the cheesecake, which is vanilla bean.  It's damn good!  The other deserts were minuscule in comparison.

We are almost always seated in the atrium room to the left of the bar, right behind the host station.  (I'm assuming this is where the closing server works)  Well on the night of 7/2/2015, again after 9:00pm, it took more than 2 hours to eat a meal that should have taken 45 minutes.  Elise took 10 minutes to bring our drinks from the bar, to which she forgot to ID us first and then stated ""I need to check your IDs before I can give these to you"", and then she must have forgotten to put our order in after we gave it to her because it took 20 minutes for our appetizer to be brought to our table.  Not only that, but it was incomplete...missing the beer cheese sauce for the pretzels.  Five minutes later our entrees came out!! We had to make room on the table for the food runner to place our plates down. I had shown Elise at the beginning of our visit that we had a buy-one get one free entree coupon.  When we asked for our bill she didn't apply the coupon, and not once in the meal period did she ask us if we were Stripes members.  I had to give the check back to her with my information on it, when she returned she still didn't apply the coupon even after I tried handing it to her AGAIN. I had to then give it back to her and have her apply the coupon.  I paid with a gift card and my debit card, which it took her about 10 minutes to return and she told me ""It took so long because the gift card was giving me problems."" What?? No apology?  Needless to say we arrived at 8:45pm weren't sat til 9, my check shows that the time stamp for my table is 9:06 we didn't get home until after 11 pm and we only live 4 miles away from the restaurant.  Elise needs to maybe go through some remedial training, and have a fire lit under her backside.  We will drive the extra miles to go to another location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lombard?start=20,2.48,2.48,2.48,1.5400000000000003,2.48

Thanks for being a great server.  Its a hard job and under appreciated!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lombard,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
75,James R.,"Villa Park, IL",0,43,,3.0,2016-11-12,"My wife and I have both enjoyed eating here, but was disappointed to receive an email from Friday's with a coupon but stating ""Lombard closing 11/13, but the fun continues at Darien and Aurora"". The other locations are much too far with too many good restaurants nearby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lombard,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
47,John S.,"Chicago, IL",0,9,,3.0,2016-11-16,"As of 11/16/16, this Friday's appears to be closed for good. People were taking things out of the restaurant and all signs were removed from the storefront. I'm somewhat sad that they're gone, but management has been terrible here in recent years. Fortunately, the location on 75th street is still open, and they have decent service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lombard?start=20,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
72,Pete J.,"Wheaton, IL",0,6,,1.0,2016-11-28,"This location is now closed, being gutted, and looks like it is slated for a complete tear down. All signage is down, and it is fenced off. Kind of sad, I remember when it first opened  in 1979. Been there probably a hundred times and have a lot of fun memories.
