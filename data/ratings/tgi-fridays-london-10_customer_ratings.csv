12,Smarty P.,"London, United Kingdom",0,23,,3.0,2012-06-06,Good food. Burgers are good. It's a bit overpriced. It's in the middle of everything in Covent Garden.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10,,,,,
7,Andreas P.,"Clapham, London, United Kingdom",37,78,50.0,1.0,2013-09-12,"Just don't.  TGI Fridays's quality has been going downhill since well, ever. The cocktails were bad. Tasted like flavoured juice. The food was bad. Burgers bland and apple sauce on a burger is a big no no. The service wasn't friendly. The place smelt like feet. The cake from hummingbird was delicious but we brought that ourselves. Just don't.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10,,,,,
8,Nat K.,"Pensacola, FL",1,92,75.0,2.0,2014-11-21,"Typical London service, so don't be expecting much. Our server didn't get to us for at least 10 minutes.  And that was only because we flagged down another server for help. One chocolate milkshake was tainted with some strawberry and  the margarita was subpar for a TGIF. The food however was good, once it finally got to us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10,,,,,
6,Monique E.,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",2,7,8.0,4.0,2015-01-07,"Had a lovely meal, it is our first trip to London (without being part of a school trip), after being tired from out trip we were thankfully seated quickly and given space for our bags (we had two small suitcases). We picked out our meals quickly and our waitress arrived with our drinks and very soon arrived with our meals. I had the Friday's Double Jack Daniels Burger (legendary Jack Daniel's sweet 'n' smoky glaze, montery jack cheese, Jack Daniel's candied bacon and Friday's mayo) while my friend had Cheeseburger Deluxe (Simply grilled and topped with cheese and Friday's mayo). The food was delicious and was well cooked, and waitress kept checking our drinks (we had bottomless) and after taking away our finished meals we had their Toffee popcorn Sundae which we both shared and thoroughly enjoyed it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10,,,,,
4,Beth W.,"London, United Kingdom",45,19,,2.0,2015-03-30,"I have been to a few different TGI restaurants in the UK, this one in Covent Garden was very disappointing!!  We went at lunch time so it was pretty quiet compared to other TGIs we have visited, however we waited a long time to have our order taken and found it very difficult to get anyones attention when trying to ask for more BBQ sauce. The waiters were friendly, but overall the service wasn't good! The atmosphere was also disappointing, our table and menus were grubby and sticky!    I had the Chicken Finger BLT sandwich, which was nice but nothing special! Overall, it was disappointing and I wouldn't return to this particular TGI restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10,,,,,
1,Helena D.,"London, United Kingdom",111,196,1447.0,4.0,2016-04-10,"If you haven't checked out this place before, I think it's a place you have to experience. The American themed restaurant has everything you'd expect - an extensive menu, large portions, lots of cheese, burgers, ribs, loaded potato skins, awesome cocktails (and giant sized cocktails are available too) and cool memorabilia (like sports collectables, a giant motorbike and who doesn't want to see a giant Spiderman figurine while you eat!).  The staff are super friendly and if you're lucky enough to celebrate your birthday here, you're in for a treat (or embarrassment depending on you look at it) as they sing to you and make you a ballon hat. They have cool little booth style seats and the option to also eat in the bar area (which is also cool).  The food was good and I especially liked the JD sauce they served with the sesame chicken.  This place has a great atmosphere and with so much choice on the menu, you'll be spoilt for choice. Also, they are doing a special late night happy hour if you download the app (2-4-1 cocktails from 8pm, Sunday-Fri), so I think I'll have to go back to check that out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10,,,,,
5,Cheryl T.,"Williamsport, PA",0,1,,2.0,2016-07-08,We stopped in on our way through to theater from the markets. We just wanted some appetizers and drinks before theater. We waited so long after being seated we actually had just picked up our purses to leave because the place was dead and the waitress refused to even acknowledge we existed. Not nearly as friendly as other London servers. Overall the worst in our trip. After we finally got our drinks I waited 20 minutes for a second drink and I finally went up to the bar to order. Overall our waitress asked us one time if we needed anything. Horrible! I'd rather pay more and go to angus steakhouse to get better service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10,,,,,
2,Nickie C.,"London, United Kingdom",133,446,373.0,2.0,2016-11-08,"Poor all around, really. I went on a weekday at lunch and the restaurant wasn't empty but it wasn't at all busy. There was no one at the station where you wait to be seated so I stood around there for quite a while, before finally someone sat me.  Then they offered me the choice of two bad tables, which also? Not great. I had to wait 10 minutes to order (I was alone and ready pretty much immediately, but I couldn't see the waiter anywhere). The food, which was just a tostada stack, took over 20 minutes and came dried out and a bit cold. The waiter did apologise for the wait, but too little too late, really. I managed to eat enough to be full and got my bill. I asked for my bill and said I had a code and indicated to my phone where the code was. He ignored the code, did the bill, and then came back to see what the code was about. Why did he think I was telling him? Obviously it was a code to be entered in before doing the cheque... so he re-did it and brought my bill, which was now just for my drink since I had a free main course from doing a survey (which is why I didn't bother complaining about the tostada). The waiter saw the food wasn't really eaten and asked if it was okay (like after I had the bill). I said it was fine, but he could tell it wasn't. He gave me a bit of a half-assed sorry as he cleared the plate. And then when I had the bill, corrected, and handed him a £10 to pay for my drink, I had to wait again while he went off for change - and then he did that annoying thing that waiters do, and brought the change in a way that indicated I should be leaving a tip. I'm afraid the service just wasn't there!  2 stars because the portion size was huge, and I've had that meal before and it's normally good. But I'm being generous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10,,,,,
3,Erik G.,"Fredensborg, Denmark",0,5,,2.0,2017-02-14,"First we got the wrong drinks - half pints, even though it was stated 500 ml. in the menu.  Then we waited approx. 45 minuts for the food. The  kids meals were half cold and not good. Our food for the adults were with dry meat (chicken and duck).  Compared to our visit 3 years ago this was a huge disapointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10,,,,,
0,Molly B.,"Baltimore, MD",15,48,47.0,4.0,2017-05-11,"Visited this Fridays while I was in London, expecting to use some of my points. Joke was on me as England is a different franchise, so I couldn't earn or use.  Visited around 2pm, it wasn't terribly busy. However, by the time I left it got crowded.  The staff were friendly. I found the most AWESOME Milkshake on the menu, so of course I ordered it once I found out it's not served in the U.S.  Omg. That shake was DIVINE.  I ordered a small Caesar salad with cucumbers added. I was surprised at how it was sliced, but the flavors were good old familiar Fridays.  The bathrooms are downstairs. There is a cute mural on the wall with a Harley parked, where you can take pictures on/with it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10,,,,,
