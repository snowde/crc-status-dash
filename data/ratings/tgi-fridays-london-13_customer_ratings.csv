8,Jodie O.,"London, United Kingdom",48,163,43.0,1.0,2012-10-23,"This place gets one star due to the amazing service and cocktail I got at the bar while waiting to be seated - the rest of my time here was rubbish. I was at the 02 to see a gig, and thought why not have a burger and cocktail. Well, we got seated after a short wait and were left to look at the menus. At this TGI's the menu is really really short, I would say it offers less than half of what you get in a normal TGI's. When the guy came to take our order I asked for a cheeseburger (which was on the menu) and a slice of bacon (which I assumed they could do because it was on another burger that I didn't fancy the look of). He looked at me like I had asked for something crazy, then told me that because they were busy I couldn't have the bacon but if they wasn't busy I could. Ermm - I don't understand, but ok. Starters came asap and were ok, we were then left for ages for our main course. When it arrived it was hot but dry, like it had been sat under the hot plate for too long. Then the guy quickly ran away! We had no drinks, no knives or forks, no sauces etc. So I waved him over to ask for all of the above, but I could only ask for one thing before he ran away. It was just rubbish service and rubbish food. I would really not choose to eat here again, but I might visit the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-13,,,,,
7,Emmanuel A.,"London, United Kingdom",43,30,80.0,2.0,2013-04-30,"This is an update from Jodie O's review. I feel like me and my wife have been here enough times to warrant a valid review and my check-ins here prove it.  The best time to go to this branch is when there is no gigs or performances going on in the main O2 arena or you will find yourself in a cue that can last up to an hour or two.  I have experience going during a performance at the O2 and I must say its not the best experience as every shop and restaurant is full to capacity.  Despite this I do have issues with TGI's menu such as: Their being no double stack burgers on the menu like on the other branch.  Also, their is a lack of surf n turf option like the other branch, meaning there combo options are very limited.  Not to mention the branch deciding to cook all their burgers one way which is well-done. That's right, no medium or medium rare option meaning we won't be seeing the juices run out of the burgers and being soaked up by the base of the bun.  Since everything else is to be expected I feel a two star is a true reflection of this branch compared to the other branches I have been to which also reflects the lack of options being presented.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-13,,,,,
6,Mital P.,"London, United Kingdom",85,691,396.0,2.0,2013-08-13,"I love TGI Friday's usually but this place isn't one of the better ones. Service is slow during the day as they only have one person waiting. I ordered some chicken wings which arrived hot but uncooked. I complained about them and was told it was impossible as all the wings arrive pre-cooked, but you could clearly see (and taste) that they weren't cooked. The manager did agree to take the plate away and not charge for them but the defensive reaction to my complaint wasn't necessary at all. It's put me off going there again, which is a shame!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-13,,,,,
5,Rawan A.,"London, United Kingdom",0,5,,1.0,2015-12-15,"Worst TGIF ever!  The food is absolutely horrendous, we were unable to even finish our meals. Granted, our waitress was very nice and extremely helpful; her name was ""Blue"" I believe.  STAY AWAY FROM THE FOOD!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-13,,,,,
3,Eakan G.,"Belvedere, London, United Kingdom",41,136,262.0,3.0,2016-04-02,"The best thing about this place is the staff. They are very happy and funny.  But the food isn't amazing.  Typical American food. Every sauce is sweet.  I got a JD roast duck. Sticky roast duck.  I must say if you like to hang out with friends in a bar, this place has a wide variety of cocktails.  I would never go here to eat. I have heard good things about the chicken fingers.  But I'd totally recommend this place for drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-13,,,,,
1,Bianca W.,"London, United Kingdom",144,355,400.0,3.0,2016-05-12,"I had booked a table for 20, so we had no wait time before being seated. Usually there's a rather long wait at this place, especially on a busy evening. You'll definitely need plenty of time to eat here, they're not known for being speedy. Service was good, though on the slow side at times. Their food portions are HUGE, be aware of that when ordering!  The food is good but not great, pretty much what you expect from a TGIF. I had the Cajun cream pasta, which is like a spicy, less cheese mac&cheese, which I enjoyed very much but couldn't finish as the large portion is REALLY large. Overall I think it's a great option for larger groups if you book ahead!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-13,,,,,
4,Lynn C.,"London, United Kingdom",14,14,56.0,3.0,2016-05-13,"Visited this restaurant on Sunday 1st May 2016 (backlog posting).  The service was rather slow, although we were a group of 24 people so this could have had something to do with it.  In the main everyone's  food seemed good and my starter of Jack Daniels sesame mushroom sticks was very tasty with the Jack Daniels sauce being sticky but delicious. I also had a lovely  mocktail called a raspberry sublime. My main meal of the shrimp tostada stack was a little disappointing the garlic roast veg was mainly onions and all of the shrimps were very burnt on one side. I would go back and would definitely have the mushrooms and the mocktail again but I would look at something different for the main course and ensure I had plenty of time available to wait.  Luckily on this visit the person organising the event made sure we had more than enough time between lunch and the film.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-13,,,,,
2,Rob S.,"Kent, United Kingdom",0,4,2.0,1.0,2016-05-30,"Wow! I hope not all TGI Friday's have become like this one. Staff: Couldn't be less interested, no smiles or cheerfulness. Once you've read on you'll appreciate that their lack of apology or attempts to try and make things better for us were just insult to injury. Waiting time once ordered: 38mins! There were only four of us in our group and only two other tables to serve. Food: Not good. My wife's burger was very disappointing and somewhat dry. I received a chilli dog when I actually ordered the Jack Daniels hotdog. My daughter ordered breaded chicken, waffles and beans, she received breaded chicken and fries, no beans. My youngest daughter actually received what she ordered (hurrah!). We had a side of vegetables which were inedible because they were browning with age. Also, check out the photo of the congealed dipping sauce - says it all. ALL THIS AFTER WAITING FOR 38MINS...38MINS! I can't urge you enough to avoid this place. It'll be a waste of your time and money. A real downer on an otherwise very good birthday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-13,,,,,
0,Helena D.,"London, United Kingdom",111,196,1447.0,3.0,2016-07-04,"I know people think TGI Fridays is overrated, but I don't like it...I LOVE it! I mean come on, tasty American food (OK a greasy food fest, but who doesn't want that every once in a while) and YUMMY cocktails under one roof. Always love the fact that they do the giant sized cocktails too.  This time I opted for the Paradise punch and Sweetheart cocktails (the latter is mighty potent - be warned!) - both were very tasty. They also have an app which gives you 2-4-1 on certain cocktails - win!  This was the first time visiting this branch and considering it is the O2, it wasn't that busy. Ordering drinks at the bar however took quite a while - the bar tender just seemed to do everything at half the speed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-13,,,,,
