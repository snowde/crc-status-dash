36,Joanna H.,"Calgary, Canada",8,45,18.0,3.0,2012-03-01,"When we got to Friday's there wasn't too much of a line so we decided to queue up. They make you stand in this foray area and we waited for about 10 mins, which wasn't bad at all but I was a little confused when we walked into the restaurant and there were empty tables everywhere. We sat and picked out what we wanted to order. I told my bf what I wanted and went to the toilet. When I came back no one had been by yet, he then told me what he wanted and went to the toilet. We had been in the restaurant for about 20 mins by this point and no one had even come by to see if we wanted to drink. I flagged down the next waiter (who had the section next to us and who I had watched walk back and forth many times) and asked him to get our server. I turned around to see who the waiter was going to approach and to find out who my server was. He came over, took our drink and appy order and took off to the kitchen, but not before he stopped at the table across from us for about the 15th time since we had been there. Before our drinks even got to our table our server went to the table across from us (3 young guys) about 5 times before he came back to us; I figured they were his friends. When our drinks got there we placed our order and off he went back to the table of guys. He ran back and forth for them (and I'm not making this up) about 20 time before he even looked our way. We sat for over 45 mins after we placed our order watching him run from the kitchen to the table then back to the kitchen. We watched them get their food (after we had ordered), drinks all topped up and even free cake before we got a single chip. My patience was running low. When we didn't see our server for another 10 mins I flagged down the one who I had before and asked him about our food. No word of a lie, he walked to the kitchen, picked it up and brought it to us. I didn't understand what the problem had been. Before I even took my first bite ""our"" server was back at the table next to us with another round of drinks, I had enough. I walked to the kitchen and asked for the manager. I've worked as a server for many years so I understand what it can be like, but you cannot put your entire focus on one table when you have a whole section of people that need to be served as well. At the end of the day I'm giving my hard earned money to this restaurant and don't expect to be treated like I'm not there. The manager told me that they were concerned that the tables of guys were going to run out on their bill so that's why he had been over there so much. I told him I could understand that but the way to deal with it is not ignore everyone else and give them top service and free cake. He apologized and asked what he could do. I didn't say something hoping to get a free meal or anything like that; I told him I didn't want anything just for him to know. The food was alright, just like every other Fridays, but the service was CRAP. Don't expect too much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-7?start=40,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002
5,Selina W.,"London, United Kingdom",0,23,,2.0,2012-07-13,"Having worked at two other TGI restaurants in the past, I was excited to come to one of the bigger stores to show my boyfriend what Friday's was all about! It was also my birthday, and I wish we'd gone elsewhere!   The door host was disinterested and had a face like thunder!  We were shown to our table and whilst the service was ok, the food... oh goodness Friday's what have you done?! The Quesadilla tasted like it had been zapped in the microwave, and the consistency of the tortilla was very odd.  The fries were skinny fries, not the usual Friday's fries you get.  The burger cheese wasn't melted and it tasted like rubber.  The Philly Cheesesteak was dry and had hardly any meat in it.   Needless to say, if you're not getting 50% staff discount then it's just not worth it.  We won't be going back, it's overpriced for what it is... which is just badly prepared and tasteless food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-7?start=20,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.728000000000001
6,Tracey W.,"Geneva, Switzerland",93,635,237.0,4.0,2012-10-29,TGI fridays as a chain can be a bit hit and miss but this one is really good. Perfect for kids party celebrations or just for hanging out with mates in a lively party atmosphere. apparently the waiting staff have to audition for the job too so there are a lot of wannabe actors looking after you. food wise the ribs and steaks are good and the desserts to die for! but not the perfect setting for a romantic meal-its just too noisy!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-7?start=20,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.992000000000001

Nice spot with lot's of cool stuff on the walls. We both only got main-dishes but it was enough to fill us up, we didn't even finish it. My girl had some kind of chickend burger and i had the sizzling chicken. I never had anything like this in my whole life. Was really delicious.

9,CJ C.,"London, United Kingdom",0,2,3.0,4.0,2013-02-13,"Our 20 minute wait for a table for three on a Wednesday night actually took about two minutes.  We hadn't even had time to decide on what to order at the bar before the little thing started buzzing that our table was ready.  The sweet potato fries at TGIs are the best around, and the steak fajita salad was generous and true American-style. The new skinny drinks menu was also great, with their skinny Long Island iced teas still delicious without the calories.  Our waiter was friendly and happy to make amends to our order. TGIs will never be gourmet, but for some reasonable American style food in London it's worth a visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-7?start=20,,,,,
32,Walsh A.,"London, United Kingdom",0,6,,1.0,2013-03-26,"I am normally a big fan of Fridays and have eaten at them for a taste of home in some pretty far away places including Malta and Nicaragua. In London, instead of a taste of home, all I got was a bad taste of the worse service London has to offer.  The hostess, Emma, would not even seat us because I originally asked for a table for 3 and changed to a table for 2 when she said she could not seat us if everyone was not  there. No problem, the third person was just meeting us for a drink after dinner so not an issue, but she did not buy that. She was confident that we would want a different table, and she was having no part of that. She was clearly not British or American by her accent, but this is Friday's, and I expect to at least get friendly service. The food is never great, and the prices are usually higher than they should be, but Friday's strong point is always fun people that like or at least appear to like what they are doing and give good service.  On a positive note, we found a great Mexican place, Chiquito, across the square and still had a great meal before Book of Mormon. We had enough time to meet my friend for a drink afterwards and it all worked out, but I am NEVER eating at Friday's in the UK again. Sorry, if you cannot at least do good service what is the appeal?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-7,,,,,

26,Scott D.,"Manchester, United Kingdom",136,119,17.0,1.0,2014-09-02,"I used to love TGI Friday's to the point that I was a weekly diner.  However on Friday evening I decided to bring family with us who were over from Dublin, one was a little child (6 yrs).  When we arrived at the door, we was greeted by someone who wasn't exactly friendly. She told us that we would have to wait at the bar for 45 mins if we wanted to eat tonight. Usually this wouldn't be a problem, but with a young child I didn't really feel it was appropriate for her to be stuck at the bar for 45 mins.  We explained this to the person at the front desk and asked if we could reserve our slot and come back within the time frame, and that we would take our little niece to the nearby M&M store.  With a grump she told us this wasn't wasn't possible. No real explanation except for ""Company Rules.  We asked for the Manager who came along, quite wimpish... we explained to him that we were loyal fans, and that we just would appreciate the bit of flexibility. My thoughts was that being a manager he would have a bit of flexibility, but also came across as non helpful and said ""Sorry company policy hands are tied"", but wasn't really helpful any further than that. We decided to leave and TGI Friday, Leicester Square lost a table of 5's business and a loyal fan. Disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-7,,,,,
24,Wayne H.,"London, United Kingdom",396,671,473.0,2.0,2014-10-05,"The place is a zoo. I see prams, old guys in blazers, kids running-falling-crying, families, office guys with their Jack and Cokes, some of the pre-show crowd, and of course tourists sipping their oh-so-authentic American milkshakes as they study their London maps. Couples on dates are clearly overwhelmed by this, not least because they're struggling to carry on a conversation over this loud, hot mess. Food at UK TGI Friday's is definitely tastier than what's back in the States. But the tourist crowd is an outright turn off. If one's curious to try, a good alternative would be the branch at Stratford Westfield.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-7,,,,,

19,Sarah A.,"London, United Kingdom",23,50,19.0,3.0,2015-11-20,"It is what it is. I went here with friends on a Sunday night - you cannot book a table which isn't great but somewhat understandable with the location - we were a party of 8 and we ended up being seated in a really odd way there was a table for six, then a glass/plastic partition and the other 2 people sat in the covered outer area (kind of like a conservatory). When the server/greeter told us about the small 2 seater table we were lead to believe it would be possible to have a conversation with the people on the other table, we were wrong, so that meant 2 of our party were basically excluded. I was not the organiser of the evening, so when they didn't raise an issue I didn't (although I feel we should have). The music is too loud, when people go to dinner, they shouldn't have to practically shout at the person opposite them (no exaggeration), we were a table of 6 and I couldn't hear what half the table said, we're at dinner not a club. The reason I am giving it 3 stars is the food, they had lot's of options including more than one veggie option and the portions were huge, definitely enough for all, I had Crispy Tostada Stacks as my main and split the loaded potato skins for starters, all of it was delicious (if a little much for me), all the rest of our party were happy with the food, and the desserts that my friend had looked AMAZING. They do what they do well, but if you are looking for an intimate dinner with friends, not the place I would recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-7,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006

This review is actually for the TGI Fridays in Leicester square who don't seem to have a page yet. I had to comment as our experience was so terrible. The food was good and extremely well presented but the service was terrible. We waited over an hour for our appetiser, then our main courses and the bill, it was a joke.  We entered the restaurant at around 21.20 and were still waiting for the bill at 11.40, we were there for about 2.5 hours it was ridiculous. We were a Party of 11 celebrating two birthdays and in top of that they tried to swindle us with the use of the cocktail voucher and the birthday reward voucher. I definitely will not return there again as the staff were not even apologetic and thought waiting for almost 3 hours was acceptable. I'm glad nobody was in the mood for desserts afterwards!

Quite surprised to see two branches at either end of Leicester Square now, they must be doing something right ...   And somehow a night at a cheesy comedy club called for a nostalgic post-show indulgence and we headed straight to the massive branch on the corner of Leicester Square.  Obviously a bit of a tourist trap but still busy enough at 10.30pm to seem attractive. Now, what used to make TGI Friday's so special in the old days was the over-the-top American service with waiters introducing themselves by name and interrupting your meal with questions about your wellbeing.  Now they are not even trying to fake it.  The first member of staff ignored us, the second mumbled something incomprehensible, the third unsmilingly informed us that no tables were ready. They all looked tired and did not make us feel at all welcome, we remembered that there were indeed two outlets and headed over to the other branch.  Here the maitre d' was wielding a bottle of window cleaner that he didn't bother putting down when the people in front of us enquired about a table ... according to the website, TGIF is open until midnight but on this occasion we were told to wait outside while the guy went to enquire with his manager - at 10.40! To sum up, you may as well rename this as WTF Friday's - what a waste of time.  Posting the same review on both as they combine into one massive disappointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-7,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007
