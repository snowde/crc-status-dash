309,Minh L.,"Cypress, CA",2,38,,1.0,2012-01-03,"I am a college student; but I guess I looked much like a young teenager on this day because the waitress completely disrespected me. She would not even look me in the eye when I made my order, and neglected my table for the rest of my meal. She did not even bring out my food; it was a cleaning waiter who did. Regardless, the food was cold, which was disappointing since I also had to wait 25-30 minutes (not exaggerated) for my food. This is expected when there are many customers, few staff, and large parties. However, there were less than 20 customers in the house and my party only consisted of myself and a date. The waitress brought the check before my meal was over, and did not say a single word. I paid for my meal, left a small tip, and brought my complaints to the manager, who went through the procedural apology and said he would talk to the waitress. How disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-long-beach?start=320,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.924,3.0000000000000004

Happy hour prices are not much different from regular price assuming you are ordering beer ($3 vs $1.50). It's a bigger difference if ordering well-drinks (50% difference). We were immediately seated. The chairs are unstable because of the cracks in the tiles. The waitress came by to take our orders but we weren't ready. When we were it took her a while to come get our orders. It also took a long time to receive our orders of which was just beer on tap. It seemed like our waitress disappeared when we wanted to get our check. Overall, not much special about this place. The food did smell good but it just reminds me of Chili's. They did have a lot of TV screens but I wish they were a bit bigger. It seems like a good place to grab drinks but the horrible service deters me from coming back.

279,Dawnie D.,"Moreno Valley, CA",3,19,3.0,1.0,2012-03-19,"Blegh! I went to this location about 2 weeks ago, and that was the last time that you will ever see me step foot in this Long Beach location again!!! The whole experience was absolutely horrible! When I first walked in, I couldn't help but notice the napkins and random pieces of trash on the floor. Strike one!!!! After my party of 3 was seated and we ordered our drinks,which were non-alcoholic, we soon received 2 out of our 3 drinks, and the waitress politely said that they were still making the 3rd drink, which was just a strawberry lemonade...Ok fine, no worries. Well 20 minutes go by and still no drink. So we had to call the waitress over to see what the status was, and she herself seemed surprised that the drink hadn't come out yet. So she then went back and came out with the drink immediately, which just tells me she was slacking on her duties..Strike 2!!!!....well after the drink was finally dropped off we ordered our food and then proceeded to grub on some of their yummy complimentary Chips n Salsa thanks to my Give Me More Stripes rewards card. Well about 45 minutes goes by, and still no food as we see our waitress from afar assisting other patrons. We figured at one point she would have came over and at least given us an update, or apologize, but nada! So then about 5 minutes later, she walks past our table and says ""oh, you guys still haven't gotten your food?..let me check on that for you."" Still no apology for the delay...Strike 3!!!!....so about 10 minutes later the food is brought out, which tasted GREAT as always, but after it was delivered we never saw our waitress again except for when we were all done...Strike 4!!!!!  So she told us she would come back to drop off the check, and by then  I was just really annoyed by her lack of attentiveness, I was just ready to leave. So she drops the bill off, and still is just not showing any empathy for our crappy experience. Well, i give her my credit card, and what she did when she dropped it back off, completely shocked me. She walks by, dropped my card back off at our table,and she keeps walking as she mumbled something to the effect of her hoping we had a great day. Would it have killed her to wait an additional 5 seconds at our table to thank us, as opposed to doing that half butt sort of drive by!?  Prior to that, I already had it in my mind that the tip was not gonna be anywhere near 20%, but after the way she left my card back at the table, I unfortunately did something that I never thought I'd do...I left NO TIP AT ALL!!!  Some of you may give this waitress the benefit of the doubt,which I am typically known for. Because hey, stuff happens! But for the fact that she not once apologized for the mishaps, was poor customer service. And the main kicker is they weren't even busy...at all...not even a little bit.  So that was my Friday's experience. I think in the future I'll stick to the one in Cerritos, because they are ALWAYS on point!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-long-beach?start=300,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.924,3.0000000000000004

The second order came out with no sauce. Are you kidding me?? I requested to speak with the manager who said he would personally cook my order since I didn't trust anyone else too since this was now the 2nd time I was returning it and we've all heard the horror stories of what happens to your food when you send it back. The manager came out with my order (now 30min after the family recieved their food), with garlic. At this point I was furious!

DENNIS you are amazing! Quite possibly one of the best waiters I've ever come across in my years of dining out. And that's from the hole-in-the-wall places to the swankiest of the swanky! He was just so personable and friendly, but not in an over bearing, annoying kind of way. You could just tell that he is a genuinely kind person and he loves what he does.  I was going to order a cold sake and he asked if I had tried the Strawberry Sake-tini, which he said was really good. I took his recommendation and absolutely loved the drink!  He kept checking on us and making sure we were good on drinks or anything else we needed.  Next time we go here, I'm gonna ask if we can be seated in his section! Lol.

There were 3 hostess at the stand who just looked at my when I walked in with my parents behind me. I told them 3 people, didn't get a reply by any of the 3 girls standing there chatting. Some words were said between them and then we were seated - most awkward walk through restaurant ever.  Seated at a dirty table which was cleaned by ourselves since the hostess never came back to clean it as she said she would.  Our waitress Octavia, was a sweetheart. Greeted nicely and could see we were still looking at menus but took our drink order immediately, and an appetizer (Mozzarella Sticks)  order.  Menu - I didn't know there were so many choices for dinner. I ordered the Baby Back Ribs with Fried Shrimp. I saw the picture of it in the menu and looked delicious. My step-dad order a Full rack of Baby Back Ribs and mom order the Salmon and Langstino Lobster combo.  We were given smaller plates for our appetizer, which came promptly after we ordered the entrees. The app plates were dirty with small crusty food stuck on one and the other two were still wet from (hopefully being in the dishwasher). We wiped those down as well.  My mom and I ordered a small salad as a side option from our entrees and asked for the to arrive before the entree. They did and were delicious, I asked for extra cheese and it was loaded! Only issues was they arrive in a small plate that was difficult to ""toss"" our salads. Mom and I ended up using the appetizer plates, much more room for salads to be fully tossed.  Dinner arrives and I'm excited. I get my plate with Rack of Ribs and onion rings. I told the runner I ordered fried shrimp combo as well, and he looked at me confused. Thank goodness, our Server Octavia rolled by and saw the mistake and promptly got them for me. The other Rack of Ribs looked delicious with a loaded potato and cole slaw. My mothers Salmon and Lobster looked alright. I took a pic of it. Her ""Lobster"" bits were stone cold and so was part of the salmon. The sauce which they threw on top was Luke warm at best. Seemed like it was sitting for awhile. The plate had no similarity to the plate the presented in the picture on the menu.  We told Octavia about the problem at the end of meal cause we had to get home. She promptly apologized and expressed that she wished we said something earlier but it was fine. It's not the server's fault. Whoever was expediting the food should of noticed the problem before it was served.  The service by Octavia was awesome, the runners who brought the food were really talkative and little weird. Made me feel uncomfortable ( especially one who ran the appetizer out, started talking to us about what else he could bring out... We said we were good and he kept talking. He finally left and I commented ""take another hit off the joint"" he seemed a little off mentally a s if he was high as a kite.   Experience wasn't bad but was good either.

We sat at the bar for Happy Hour, ordered an Apple Martini and a Margarita. Both very good. So we asked for another round. As appetizers we ordered potato skins and mozzarella sticks because we couldn't remember the last time we had it. We found a piece of METAL in the Mariana sauce for the sticks. When we showed the bartender, he assumed it was a piece of tomato just like we did. Once we corrected him he got us a manager right away. Destiny the manager was very sweet and understanding, immediately went to the kitchen to find out what that was, and learned it was from the refrigerator. She says she threw out that container and used another one. But to be honest at that point we had lost our appetite. She understood and didn't charge us for the food or second round of drinks since we hadn't touched it. I had jokingly said if we could keep the mason jar they used to give us our bill on, and she actually gave it to us! One each! She was very sweet, like I said...but in all honesty I doubt I'll go back there. It makes me wonder what that kitchen looks like to have a piece of metal fall into a container, and go unnoticed by the employee pouring the sauce.

My friend and I decided to share the option of 5 taste-&-share appetizers for around $23. From the options we chose the Garlic and Basil Bruschetta, Ahi Tuna Crisps, Bacon Mac & Cheese Bites, Thai Pork Tacos, Hibachi Skewers(black angus sirloin).  Garlic and Basil Bruschetta - I did not try this since I do not like tomatoes, but my friend really enjoyed it.  Ahi Tuna Crisps - One may think Ahi Tuna would not combine well on a tortilla chip with guacamole... but actually it tasted pretty darn good and was fun to eat.  Bacon Mac & Cheese Bites - just what one would expect, cheesy and good. My coworker wasn't into it only because she wasn't into mac & cheese in general.  Thai Pork Tacos - Really excellent! Full of flavor! No complaint.  Hibachi Skewers - Yummy. I'm not a fan of steaks, so small bite-size pieces were perfect for me to get my meat fix without feeling overwhelmed. I also had the Electric Lemonade which was delicious and I got a good buzz going with two drinks that lasted a while. (I'm a little weak-sauce when it comes to alcohol) :D  Our other friends liked their choices too, but since I didn't try any of it and was too busy buzzing to take note of it, it wouldn't be fair to give an accurate review on their food.

Thankfully it was happy hour! Our server was awesome but the food was no better than a microwave meal. My daughter and I ordered the Jack Daniels Chicken meal and my chicken was hard to cut and rubbery. Honestly it felt like I was chewing a bunch of rubberbands. The mashed potatoes were definitely not homemade. The vegetables were barely steamed and pretty much tasted like wet almost raw veggies. No seasoning at all. So disappointing. I don't know why people eat there. It has to be the $5 margaritas. That was the best part of my meal. My friends meal looked nothing like the picture on the menu and in fact she barely are any of it because it wasn't as good as it sounded. Pretty sad. I don't think I'll ever eat there again.

Unfortunately being understaffed is not the waitresses fault its the fault of the Management team! They need to get it together!  The waitress did give us a free desert which is why I gave it 4 stars. If it hadn't been for Octavia it definitely deserved 3 stars.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-long-beach?start=140,2.88,2.67,2.67,2.288,2.7539999999999996

191,Betsy C.,"Lake Forest, CA",15,49,36.0,2.0,2015-03-01,"My girlfriends and I usually love coming here to meet up for dinner and a few cocktails.  In fact,  it's been a long standing tradition of ours for like 5 years!  I'm upset to have to write a  negative review because of all the great time we've had there in the past.  The fact of the matter is that this last experience was so disappointing,  I feel I need to share it.  It seems that most of the amazing staff that we're used to having may not be there anymore and whoever is training these new staff is doing a poor job of teaching customer service.  We sat outside in the patio area like we usually do and ordered food and drinks while we caught up.  Our servers basically neglected us most of the time.  We found ourselves having to raise our hands,  as if we were in grade school,  just to have someone stop for 10 seconds whenever we needed anything.  The worst part of it was that there was one table next to us who were getting checked on constantly and the server would talk with them,  joke,  and banter with them then walk right past us,  blatantly ignoring us.  Very,  very rude.  We were pissed!  Granted,  the girl may not have been our actual server but if we're sitting there trying to get some service,  I  mean,  stop and ask or get our server or something! The server who eventually took our orders barely only motioned to us through the window when we needed our check,  didn't bother to come out and seemed rushed when he finally approached the table.   2 stars because the food and cocktails were good,  but if we decide to return to this location, we  will definitely request a different server if given the same one.  Wish we had taken names...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-long-beach?start=200,3.2,2.73,2.73,2.152,2.918
167,Stevie W.,"Long Beach, CA",701,111,11.0,1.0,2015-03-01,"Made the mistake of hitting this place on  a Saturday night at about 5 ish. (Don't do it.! You will be sorry for the 25+ min wait). There was not enough indoor space. We were patient.  We were taken to the back  diningroom. Our server  most likely was new. He was very stiff and seemed unsure of what he was doing. Given that we waited 15 minutes for hot green tea and a beer, I was hoping it would get better.  Unfortunately it did not.  We placed an order of 2 house salads (I asked for my dressing to be on the side) . We split an entree (Jack Daniels full slab of ribs) . It took 30 + minutes for us to get one slab of ribs with cole slaw and   fries. While we waited (and waited and waited) for dinner, I ran to the rest room which had a line and was in desperate need of clean-up! There was paper all over the floor. The stalls were running out of supplies and one of the two paper towel dispensers didn't work at all.   It was a mess  in there!!   Unfortunately the house salads didn't arrive till AFTER our entree!  It was a bagged salad mix with one tiny  pearl tomato cut in half and a sprinkle of cheese. My salad dressing was not on the side... and I was not happy about it.  Why did it take nearly 40 mins to get a salad that would have taken someone less than 5 minutes to put them into bowls?     The kitchen had been kind enough to split the rack in half and give us each a plate.  the cole slaw was just  so-so.. right from the container it had been mixed up in. (again it's bagged with a light dressing ( plus on that) .) It's not rocket science or even  creative cuisine here.   The ribs were not warm. The side of bbq sauce (with Jack in it)  was not warm either.  Clearly the meal sat for a bit  before it was delivered. The fries weren't bad..crispy but they got cold fast.  The server apologized for the lateness of the salads (they had yet to be delivered at this point) He stressed that the  manager was going to comp us the salads since   they were so late.   I had already eaten one rib , some cole slaw and a couple for fries when a team server delivered the salads. The look on her face (priceless!)  when she saw our dinner was already on the table made it clear that the kitchen ( or someone) had dropped the ball on  this order.  We also ordered more refills on drinks (beer and tea) and it took 20 minutes + to get them.  The salad was meh.... no style, personality or seasoning. I did get the avocado  vinaigrette but I really didn't want it all over the salad. I don't like salads drowned in dressing.     We did order dessert which is ok... . The server did  check back  once with us but he wasn't on his game. He walked by us several times  to work with other tables.  Given that dinner was 1) late 2) a little less than warm  3) salads were really late..  I was tempted to ask to talk to the manager.  We did ask for the bill and  when I got the check there was only one salad comped for less than the price of the salad. The bill said the salad was $3.19.. and they credited us 2.75..... (are they charging us for the salad dressing? )  The server did tell us that we were being comped both salads + $5 for the problems with our meal . (wouldn't it have been cheaper to comp us a beer or dessert?)  and he gave us an amended  receipt with 2 salads comped at $2.75 each with us paying the difference  of the $3.19 each. It's not the $$ I am concerned about .. but if you are going to nickle and dime me to death on this meal that we had to wait  so long for .. it seems crazy.  We waited for someone (the server, other servers, staff members setting up the tables around us) to take the check and run it...... but no one acknowledged us. (5 people!!)  I hit the button on the  table computer to get some help because we wanted to leave. There were 4 different tables around us empty and  a new party about to be seated for 20...  A manager came in and looked at the table across from us (and we have the flashing red light at the top of the computer  going off). He's looking for a good minute or two before he notices the flashing light.  He did come over and take the payment but either he was ignorant of the issues at our table or he didn't want to address them. I did want to talk to him and he vanished as soon as he picked up the check to run the payment.    I must say I am very disappointed in this place..... and the lack of follow-through on the staff, the disconnect on customer service and explanation of why were were paying .45 cents each for salads that should have been out of the kitchen almost immediately  after we ordered them... but got zero attention.  I think this particular store needs re-training , a major clean-up of the bathrooms and someone to keep checking on them on a  busy weekend night.  I think the managers just blew us off since I saw 2 of them near our table but not near enough with the  noise factor for us to  get their attention.  I have a feeling it's  like this ALL the time there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-long-beach?start=180,3.04,2.73,2.73,1.956,2.854

My friend ordered the steak and ribs every time they attempted to cut the steak the whole table would move. They took so long to bring the food out that my plate was hot but my friends plate was cold like it was just sitting there. The waitress knew it was taking long because every time she passed our table she avoided eye contact.

Servers seriously do not care, they only care at the end when you're leaving, why because they want a tip, with the service you're giving me, no. I went about 2 weeks ago for the second thinking the service would have changed from the first one and it didn't, it was worse. I asked for the $12 for endless appetizers, so I can switch it around when I am done with one appetizer and the server was being rude. She was saying that it would be too much for me to eat, I know what I can eat and I do not want your opinion. I let her know 3 times that I wanted the $12 one and she finally gave in and let me get it. The appetizer's itself did not come out for 30 minutes! and the drinks took 20 minutes.

107,Heather C.,"Lakewood, CA",1112,200,4723.0,1.0,2015-08-19,"I must be on a 1 star roll this week.. Ugh. Craptastic!  We're in the middle of planning our end of summer river trip, and decided to hit Sport Chalet for some of the water gear left on our list. We spent a little longer than planned and ended up being super hungry! We debated on making it to go or dining in, and settled on the latter. Which is probably were our dinner went wrong. I've only ever dined in here one other time, always order to go because they're always packed! Tonight, the wait was quoted at 15 minutes, it ended up being closer to 25. On top of it, the hostess kept calling the wrong party sizes/names. She called the wrong groups at least 3 times. Since we had so much time to kill, we browsed the menu and ended up making up our minds while we waited. I figured it would make our dinner got not only quicker but smoother... Oh how wrong was I. When we were seated at the booth, the first thing I noticed was NO SILVERWARE. What the hell.. Again, twice in one week!! F@$k! Ugh anyways.. Our server, Brooke, took our orders, and then asked if we wanted any drinks. Well, yeah? I don't want to eat chicken and shrimp with a dry mouth. She ran by our table 3 times, and stopped on the fourth and asked what our drink order was again.  Seriously?! Keep in mind we were 4 booths away from the fountain machine.. I could see it from my seat!! Took our drink order again and whizzed off. 5 minutes later she reappeared with our drinks and 4 straws. For 2 drinks. Ok? We asked for silverware for the second time and she said she'd be right back. She buzzed by 3 times and then we didn't see her again for awhile. FIL's side salad was delivered.. We still had no silverware, so he asked the girl that brought the salad if she could bring some. She said sure, and took off. We saw this girl go by a few times and still no silverware. At this point we contemplated just talking to the manager before we left. Randomly, we get brought one fork in a napkin for FIL to eat his salad with. Wow. Our conversation was further interrupted by our dinner being brought to the table. Um, still no silverware. FIL gets his plate, missing the sauce for his steak that is supposed to COME WITH THE PLATE. BF gets his plate, potatoes are cheese-less, and my potatoes are not only cheese-less but the bacon is MIA too. So I tell the girl that brings the plates what's wrong, she takes them back and we ask HER for silverware too. She said she'd bring it back in a minute. Brooke walks by, we ask her about the missing utensils..she says oh, and runs off to the kitchen.  She comes back and says, AND I QUOTE ""we're a little short right now, give me a few minutes."" And runs off. ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?! YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CLEAN SILVERWARE!?!? WHAT THE f&@k!!!!!! I'm pissed at this point. I have food in front of me as my plate has been delivered and I now have cheese and bacon mashed potatoes. We wait all of 10 minutes, I timed it, for our silverware to be delivered so we can finally eat. Good lord! At this point we've been in the goddamn restaurant for an hour and we are barely eating! AAAAHHHHHH!!!!! She asked how everything was about 5 minutes later and failed to notice the clearly empty glass in front of me. In the middle of the table. When she walked away, I dinged her for that too. Any server should POINT BLANK notice an empty glass and offer a refill. She walked by twice more, and my BF decided to flag her down. He started to ask her if he could get a refill, and tell me WHY this girl had the NERVE to open her mouth and try to cut him off and ask the same damn question. Girl, you should have just let him finish the question, you only stopped because he flagged you down, don't act like you noticed the glass.  The only saving grace was the food, hence the one star(and also because yelp requires you to give one star!) the Jack Daniel's Chicken and Shrimp is my favorite, but this time the chicken was just as little dry. Nothing the extra JD sauce couldn't fix. I love dipping the crispy seasoned shrimp in the sauce too.  I haven't really tried much else from here, other than the Tennessee Whiskey Cake(also has JD hehe, I love my man Jack okay!), which is sweet with a little kick from the JD. It's really yummy (^_^). Overall I do like the plate, and since it's basically all I order and it's never been bad.. One star for consistently good food. Good job on that.  I wouldn't recommend for dining in. Service sucks and they're far tooooo busy and unable to accommodate the amount of customers they have. If they could fix that, it might not be a half bad place to sit down before a movie or something. Other than that.. Just get it to go. If you're really crazy, they have some rewards program too.  Overall, tonight was a waste of $77.

Today, we decided to go for dinner, and we were missing one set of utensils. The other two sets were so dirty as if they hadn't even been cleaned, so we asked our waitress to get us new utensils. We waited a long time, and even after we got our food, we sat there without utensils, and we had to get up and talk to one of the workers at the front desk because there were no waiters walking around for over ten minutes.  Another problem was that the entree I ordered, which was an expensive $14.99, was a measly six to seven spoonfuls. It was a ""sizzling shrimp"" entree that comes with risotto-style rice, and I asked the waitress about the portion size, and she gestured with her hands that it came with a lot of food. However, it was barely enough for one small girl to eat for dinner, and it was about 50% cheese. I ran my fork through the stone pot, and I mostly only had clumps of cheese instead of solid food. Also, our waitress tried to take away our dessert before we had even finished.  The fact that they're accepting $14.99 for a stone pot of cheese makes no sense to me, and overall, due to the poor service, food portions, and food taste, we're truly disappointed in TGIF Friday's and have decided not to go again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-long-beach?start=120,2.52,2.48,2.48,1.7960000000000003,2.496

The fresh plate of fries had a hair in it. We had to ask multiple times for new drinks. The manager never once came to talk to us and apologize for all the mistakes.

So we ask for waters and as she's bringing my glass she drops it on the table and glass shatters right in front of me and where my three year old nephew was sitting.  Luckily my sister grabbed my nephew out of the way because the glass shattered everywhere and it did get on me and all over the table and floor, plus water spilled all over me. She said sorry and just left and sent someone to clean it. Honestly, she's lucky my family was calm about it because if we were assholes we could of made a huge seen about it especially since she could of hurt my nephew. She didn't even seem very sorry AND you would think we would get some sort of discount but nothing.  She screwed up on small things too but breaking glass like that was dangerous and I feel like a manager should have checked on us. I work at an upscale restaurant and if something like that were to happen we would have had mangers speaking to the table and a discount for sure. Just felt like she was careless .

The chicken nachos, don't get it.  It was only $5 because of the happy hour price but finding any chicken is like searching for a needle in a haystack.  Its ridiculous that people actually pay $10 regular price for that sorry excuse of a dish.   The service use to be good here back in the day but it has gone through a serious decline.  There were zero redeeming qualities to this place.

12,Rodney S.,"Cerritos, CA",4925,799,5561.0,4.0,2016-08-14,"BETWEEN THE REVIEWS w/ Rodney S Q) What brought you to TGI Fridays at the Long Beach Town Centre, Rodney? A)  Well, Rodney, I had a family get together lunch.  TGI Fridays was my mom's choice, as I would have rather gone for Korean BBQ or ramen, myself.  Hey, gotta take one for the team every now & then. Q)  Did you receive any perks for being a Give Me More Stripes rewards member? A)  Yes, I did!  My table received complimentary chips & salsa! Q)  Rodney, what was your lunch entrée? A)  I went for the Endless Apps option.  $10 gives you AYCE of the same appetizer, whereas spending an extra $2 for the $12 option gives you AYCE of all the select appetizers, one at a time.  Here's how each round went- Loaded potato skins My favorite, the potato skins were piping hot on arrival.  The gooey cheese & salty bacon provided for a satisfying appetizer, in addition to the sour cream dip. Boneless garlic parmesan wings I'm a  bone-in wing guy, so I was a little perturbed as only boneless wings are offered for the Endless Apps.  Nevertheless, the garlic parmesan wings were good, albeit more breading than meat. Braised beef mini tostadas These were rather nice.  With a flavor profile reminding me of bulgogi, the braised beef was more sweet than salty.  The mini tostada shells were crispy & this dish is great to share, although you're technically not supposed to.  Shhhhhhh! Pan seared potstickers These were decent, being a tad bit dry for my liking.  I like dumplings to be on the moist & juicy side.  The dipping sauce helped alleviate the dryness, though. Tuscan spinach dip My second to my last app, the Tuscan spinach dip proved to be very heavy.  Of all the apps I had, this was my least favorite. Boneless miso wings Disappointed that TGI Fridays doesn't serve PB & J wings, since I was highly intrigued in trying it for myself, I went with the next curiosity - miso wings!  These did, indeed, taste like miso.  Salty, earthy & again, more breading than chicken. Q)  How was the service? A)  Rodney, the service was excellent!  Kevin was our attendant, and he was friendly, hospitable & at the ready to accommodate any of our needs.  He made our lunch a delightful experience. Q)  Is the parking hard to find? A)  Being in the Long Beach Town Centre and adjacent to the movie theater, parking at TGI Fridays can be hard to come by during peak hours.   With lunch hours, parking was easily accessible. Q)  Do your recommend visit this TGI Fridays, Rodney? A)  I do!  Utilizing the $12 Endless Apps, I went 6 rounds which equals to $2 an app.  Great value!  Plus, as a Give Me More Stripe member, I received chips & salsa, along with a complimentary dessert during my birthday month.  Not too shabby, Rodney.  For the food, I give 3 stars, but with the great service provided by Kevin, I have to add a star just for that.   Recommend!

166,Steve F.,"Long Beach, CA",0,43,,4.0,2017-01-07,"So I wanted something different for dinner after being out running errands and decided to stop in and give it a try.  First I was impressed by the neat and uniform appearance of the workers, still casual but nice to see uniformity.  I sat at the bar and had Frank as my bartender/server. His service was great. I ordered the pretzels as an appetizer. I was disappointed in these. They were more bread like than pretzel like. The cheese sauce that came with them however was fantastic. Now my burger arrived before I was even half done with my appetizer.  I ordered the smoke stacked burger. It was described as sausage and onion in between two burgers. Well, I could only find two small pieces of sausage and no onion. The flavor was good, with the right balance between the meat and the condiments. And the bites I had with the sausage were great. Would have liked a little more sausage and onion though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-long-beach?start=180,2.64,2.49,2.552,2.416,2.5500000000000003
51,Anthony B.,"Long Beach, CA",27,1,,2.0,2017-01-10,"Like many establishments, TGI Friday's will make promises they won't keep when the time comes to do so. I was offered discount coupons of $8 each, and the server had told me it would be discounted off my entire order.  With that being said, I wanted to use both last night when I went to eat with a friend - the server ""regretted""  to inform me that not only could only one of them be used at a time, but only half of the coupon would be used to discount my meal.  Of course, they WAITED UNTIL I'd finished my meal before approaching me with this problem - I was MAD that I came out of the restaurant paying more than I was led to expect UNTIL I WAS JUST FINISHED EATING. This is a textbook case of baiting me to come eat at their restaurant, and make me pay far, FAR more than they promise you.  Thanks, guys. Either I get compensated for this, or I'm telling everybody about your fraudulent practices. I may sound petty as it is, but given the server's attitude combined with poor customer service, I could not have been anymore angry about spending my money on food for a night. EDIT: I switched it from a 1 to a 2 star review, because I cannot deny that the service throughout the meal was good.

I came in around 2:00pm on a Saturday to eat and watch the NFL playoffs. The restaurant was really clean, nicely decorated, and the employees were friendly. If you like sports this a great place because it is decked out with flat screen TV's in all directions. Good LG and Samsung tv's. I was sitting at a tall table just to the side of the bar and the bartender, Manny, was always one step ahead of me. When I needed a coffee or when I was ready to pay my bill he already knew and was on it. The second bartender was great too but I didn't get his name. I ordered the Mediterranean Mahi Mahi fish sandwich and it was really good. About $13.50. I've had a couple subpar experiences at Friday's in the past (not this location though) and was pleasantly surprised at how cool this one is.

I ordered grilled salmon that came with mac and cheese and baked potato as the sides. My boyfriend order a stack of ribs with chef's veggies, shrimp, and fries.  So his order comes out and it's a full stack of ribs with the veggies and rice, NO fries and shrimp. He informed our waitress and told him about the mistake in his entree.  She comes back to double check with him on what he ordered and told him that the stack of ribs come in either half or full. I feel that she should've informed us of that in the first place.

114,Alex U.,"Long Beach, CA",3,41,22.0,1.0,2017-02-19,I am so disappointed in the service received at this location today. I arrived with a friend about 3:30. After waiting several minutes just to be acknowledged by the bartender we placed an order for endless apps. Quite some time went by no acknowledgment from staff what so ever. Then the people next to use who came AFTER us gets their order of food. I decided the bar area is just lacking attention let's just get a table. We explain the situation to the manager and she gets us a table right away. We then place another order for the same thing with our server. Who runs off to put it in then comes back moments later and says you already ordered at the bar and they'll bring that out and we will close out that bill then put this order in. I say no worries it's been so long that it has to be coming any moment. Another 20-25mins goes by and still not food. At this time the new server is avoiding our section like we were in quarantine. However pays great attention to the table two over. Finally my friend gets up and approaches the manager and asked what was the hold up it's been almost an hour and still nothing. The manager tells her that all she can do it look for the food there's nothing she can do did she want her to go look for it. I stepped in and asked was it sent to our old seats where is the food supposed to be. The manager who was dressed very unprofessional in street clothes as if she had just came from the mall with an attitude says all I can do it look. I don't see how that's even appropriate to tell someone who is telling you they've been there over an hour and haven't received anything should be treated. My friend says maybe we should just go because this is so frustrating and the manager says out of her own mouth. That's fine. no sense of pride in her job or humility or concern for the guest dining experience. She just walks away and doesn't even apologize or seem to care. She walked off so quick I had to yell for her attention to ask for a card. She then points at a man standing behind me a few feet and says that's my general manager which had he been standing there that whole time had to have seen the or at least noticed there was a situation and could have shown some interest. But this business is being run and operated by people who have no interest or pride in their work. I don't plan on letting this just go. Judging by the reviews on this location they have horrible service in general. In addition to this review I plan on filing a formal complaint with not only the franchise holders but BBB.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-long-beach?start=100,2.52,2.41,2.536,2.372,2.454

Once seated, the waitress came over took drink orders.  Brought our drinks and then we ordered.  Simple order: beef dip and chicken cobb salad hold the crumbled blue cheese; it took a good 20 minutes for our order to come out.  Blue cheese crumbles were on salad, we just picked off since it took so long to get food in the first place.  As I proceeded to eat my beef dip, I noticed the little ramekin with the hot au jus was broken and that the cracked piece was loose; flagged down a manager she said she would be right back with a new one.  She came back with what appeared to be au jus; the ramekin was cold, I tasted the sauce, it was teriyaki.  Flagged down the waitress and told her, she went to get me the au jus. She came back and said they would be taking the sandwich off the bill (which they did); BUT, the au jus was ice cold.   I've worked the restaurant business.  I'm very patient.

TGI Fridays in Long Beach is a 180 degree opposite and if I could give more than 5 stars, I would. Debbie was our server and she was, in a word, AWESOME!!! The food was great, the service, as I said, was awesome and I couldn't ask for a better experience for me and the three others with me. I told Debbie and the actual manager about our experience with the Westminster Mall restaurant only AFTER our meal was complete. They were visably shocked about how we were treated there and offered suggestions of who to call to voice our concerns. I will be doing that and singing the praises of this restaurant to the powers that be tomorrow.

When we got to our table our waitress dropped down our stuff and left without introducing herself. Overall she was very rude, asking as for our orders by pointing at each of us in the party and asking, ""You? You?"" Then at the end she added $1 for playing on apps when there wasn't even a tablet at our table.  I ordered the endless apps for $10. The meatballs came in at the same time everyone elses order came in, so I ordered my second appetizer. It did not come in until 10 minutes before we were about to leave. The meatballs tasted horrible, way too much water in them and the second appetizer, chicken wings, tasted dry and were cold.

Then they changed their wine list and it was bunch of crappy wines and wine is part of my enjoyment of food. But times have changed and so has Friday's!! Now they have a pretty good selection of wines - not upscale by any means but nice, friendly wines. We came here for Happy Hour to discover that they have 9-ounce glasses of wine (any wine on the list) for 6 bucks on happy hour.  The appetizers are the same as they always were. Consistently good but never great. The service is the same. We always get pretty good service here, but, again, never great.  The ambiance at Fridays is always energetic. It's a hopping place for people to hang out and grab a bite.  The menu is pretty basic, the food is pretty good, the service is pretty good.

We were greeted by a woman who was shadowing a new server. I don't know why this woman is a trainer because it took her 15 minutes to come back to take our order. We didn't see her or the trainee for about 35 minutes after we ordered our food. I had to go up to the Host to ask her to find our where our food was because we had been waiting over 40 minutes by then.  The food came out maybe five minutes after I told the host, and I had to return it almost immediately. I was already pissed off that I had to wait almost an hour, but my burger came out semi-cold and was cooked well done when I asked for it to be cooked medium. The slow trainer finally came to our table to apologize for the wait and asked if I wanted to order anything else, but by that time I was over it and just wanted to leave. She offered free dessert which was a joke because it was happy hour so all that crap was discounted already. I paid for the appetizer which should have been comped and my sister's meal and left without eating because I couldn't be there anymore. I couldn't believe a manager also never came to our table to tell us anything. If I could give this place -5 stars, I would. You'll never see me here again.

The hostesses were prompt about seating me and my boyfriend.  I saw the endless appetizer menu and was super stoked. I asked the waitress initially bout how the deal works and she said I could order 1 appetizer and only get a refill for that specific order. So I Ordered the flatbread, meatballs, and wings. My man ordered a drink. she rushed off to place order. My boyfriend was confused why the waitress Said I'd be charged $30 and informed me that the waitress had misinformed me about the deal. So I call back the waitress to re-do my order so I could only be charged the proper $10. She proceeded to try to charge me 2 orders assuming I was gonna share ( which I didn't Bc my man later ordered a salad ) I started feeling funny after eating the meatballs and I thought it was maybe I was eating alittle too fast. So I slowed down and spent about an hr just tryin to enjoy my date as my boyfriend had to wave down 2 SEPARATE WAITRESSES. To receive his orders. By this point I finished 2 more appetizers at snail speed and cautiously My nausea got worse and I ended up Throwing up all my food. So we informed the waitress of the issue and she brought the manager. He then informed me it was Probably a ""texture issue Bc it's ground beef"" speaking to me as  if I'm dumb enough to continue to finish an item if I simply didn't like the ""texture"" So he tried to rush us for the check and asked our check consisted of 2 appetizer orders and salad  and drink  And I corrected him by saying ""no, I was the only one that ordered the endless appetizer "" and he proceeded to as me  "" are you sure you didn't share ?"" The sheer audacity to asked me if I'm Sure about my check after I just told this man I threw up everything I consumed is insulting.

But today I dropped in and it was not busy at all. Despite this fact, the rude hostess made us wait for a table, in an entirely empty section, just because we declined to sit in the bar section. She then sat us at a table for like six or eight people, which made no sense at all. Since we got there just before the dinner rush, AND there were only two of us, I asked if we can switch to a smaller table. She said it was fine as she huffed and puffed and rolled her eyes. Well excuse ME for being logical. Any way, so we sat around for another five minutes or so before our server came to even take our drink order. I asked her for the endless app menu and had to wait another five minutes just for that. As we sat twiddling our thumbs, we overhead the hostess talking to our waitress and she blurted out, ""Who cares? They can wait"" and started laughing. I don't think they were referring to us but that's still very unprofessional! Then as we finally started ordering our food, I asked my wife which appetizer we should start with and the waitress snapped at us saying that we can't share. I told her if I'm paying for the food then I'll do with it whatever I please. She then said it was part of the rules that I can't share and that she would have to double charge us for the appetizers! I told her that I'm still going to share my food and she ran away to go get a manager. Needless to say we walked out, and with zero intentions of ever going back. Is this how they treat all of their Stripes Members?(Stripes = loyalty program) We ended up going to The Roadhouse Grill across the lot and it was a great decision.

Chili's has a great deal for $22 you get an appetizer or dessert for two and two entrees with real normal sized servings. We won't be visiting Friday's again anytime soon. Over priced and measly serving sizes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-long-beach?start=80,2.2,2.54,2.488,,2.404
23,Amber H.,"Lakewood, CA",626,2,,2.0,2017-10-24,"I live across the street from this location, and my hockey team likes to frequent it after games for late night apps as it is one of few places open late at night with the kitchen available. But last night put a sour taste in my mouth. I ordered a BBQ Chicken Salad and a *side* order of their Onion Rings and my friend ordered the Fridays Combo with Traditional Wings, Pot Stickers and Loaded Potato Skins. When I got my order, my salad was short of the avocado and bacon that was suppose to come with it. My friends order of wings were so dry it looked like they poured the wing sauce on the plate first, and dropped the wings on top, instead of tossing them. At the end, I noticed I was charged for an appetizer of onion rings when I clearly stated and showed our server on the menu, the side order (I was debating between that and the sweet potato fries on which was cheaper). So an extra $3.00 charge for something I did not order, and an order that was wrong when I received it. Our server didn't even offer to take the $3.00 difference from the appetizer to the side off our tab for her mistake. A few hours later, we were at home and both started feeling sick (we shared the onion rings). I am not sure if it was a coincidence or not, but both of us got sick after eating here, and I have had food poisoning all day today. I use to enjoy coming to TGI Fridays but to spend good money on food that wasn't even prepared as stated on the menu, and to be charged for something I didn't order won't have me coming back anytime soon unfortunately.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-long-beach?start=40,2.2,2.53,2.492,,2.398
16,Soli H.,"Long Beach, CA",72,22,23.0,4.0,2017-11-03,"Came here for dinner with my family after KBF. The dodgers were playing that night so it wasn't too crowded. Shocking since it was the last game. Our waitress was pretty much all over the place but she was a sweet gal. They had a deal where u buy 2 plates for $14. Not bad!! We got the ribs with Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes, so good! Although to me the Mac and cheese was too cheesy for me. Great meal to end our family night out. Happy yelping!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-long-beach,2.16,2.52,2.492,,2.3760000000000003
57,Alec M.,"Buena Park, CA",0,2,,5.0,2017-11-10,"At a place like Fridays you already expect and know the quality of food, you can't expect a $100 steak for $14.99, But the service is what needs to be on par and it is, Desiree and Erika went the extra mile to make sure our experience was great especially on the cold patio section of the bar, making sure we were not forgotten as we were the only ones out there. Constant re-fills on drinks, and quick and constant service for anything we needed. Thanks again Erika and Desiree, fantastic service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-long-beach?start=20,2.32,2.55,2.504,,2.458
55,Evelinn B.,"Lakewood, CA",171,1,,2.0,2017-11-12,"Every time I come here my service is bad. I come, the place is empty except for one party. Waited about 15 mins for the waitress to simply tell us ""I'll be with you guys in a second "" just to wait another 10 and not even ask if we even wanted drinks. When she finally came around we asked about the endless app she said it wouldn't be worth to get cus the kitchen closed in 15-30 mins. We would've had time if she had helped us in those twenty mins we stayed waiting unacknowledged. And in the 20 mins she was in the back laughing and making jokes about her behind. I get better service across the street at Denny's :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-long-beach?start=20,2.36,2.55,2.504,,2.474

1,Trish M.,"El Segundo, CA",0,17,14.0,1.0,2017-12-10,"I guess this is the Prehistoric era where we eat with our hands and maybe try with our toes because last time I checked we need utensils to eat food.  Why do you provide 2 forks for 4 people eating main dishes, even my 3rd grade children didn't need Common Core to figure out the answer should be 4 forks for 4 people.  If you're thirsty you better suck on those ice cubes in your empty glass to quench your thirst because soft drinks are worth more than Bitcoins at this place.  Seriously, where is my  waitress...maybe she's lost in ""The Upside Down"" because she's not here and DEFINITELY not at my table with empty glasses, no napkins and empty plates! I've always enjoyed Fridays and especially the Happy Hour prices but the lack of ANY service doesn't make me HAPPY nor thank gosh it's a Friday!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-long-beach,2.36,2.5,2.496,,2.444
4,Gene S.,"Signal Hill, CA",26,50,1.0,1.0,2018-01-05,"If you look at my reviews, they are almost all 5 stars so I rarely leave a bad one. However, TGIF took about 10 minutes just to get water. The waiter was nice enough but seemed too overwhelmed. The Brussel Sprouts were bland, my wife's Black Bean burger was really hard and old. My Beyond Meat burger was decent, but the fries were pretty bad. Out check took forever to get and we had to ask several times. Would not recommend this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-long-beach,2.32,2.5,2.488,,2.428
7,Jessica D.,"Long Beach, CA",0,11,,2.0,2018-01-08,"The food was 5 stars but service was -3 so I landed on 2. I came here for my brother in laws 21st birthday and upon arrival we stood at the door for 15 minutes before we saw anyone who worked there. They had us wait another few minutes to push tables together(accommodating a group of 6) before seating us. We didn't all get our drinks for another 20-30 minutes, and some of them were missing when they did finally come out. Our food(which was mostly appetizers) didn't come out until after guests who'd arrived after us received their food - which were steaks, etc. We sat and waited for our check for a very long time. We were all exhausted and just wanted to go home but we're amongst the last in the restaurant. I might not have noticed the less than stellar service had there not been a table of older women sitting next to us who arrived after us and left before, with priority in between. I can only assume the waitress placed higher priority on the table she thought would tip more. The hostess knew we were upset and made a rude face at us on our way out(she probably didn't know we were looking). Sad. Won't be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-long-beach,2.2,2.49,2.484,,2.3740000000000006
