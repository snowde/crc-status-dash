31,Benjamin F.,"Longmont, CO",0,17,,2.0,2012-03-31,"TGI Friday's changed their menu nationwide in 2010, and since then it's not worth going. Most of the best menu items have disappeared entirely. The ""grown up mac and cheese"" was particularly good nice (and a healthier preparation too), but it's long gone from the options. The fries are now shoestring style, making them less suitable for dipping, and inevitably making your hands greasier (use of a fork is now impractical). The fried green beans are still there, and are still delicious, but TGI Friday's has a line of frozen snacks you can buy at the grocery store, and those green beans are just as good as what's in the restaurant (and for a lot less money). Last time I was here the only item I even considered was the burger, and there are better places to get burgers in Longmont. Pumphouse Brewery on Main Street downtown is an excellent alternative. Before 2010 this was a great casual family restaurant. With the new menu, it's a little too specialized.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-longmont-2?start=20,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006

14,Nicole M.,"Appleton, WI",68,77,3.0,2.0,2013-03-19,"Trivia on Tuesday nights is great.  We love the DJ and the entertainment.  However, the waitstaff in the bar area is consistently lacking.  They take too long to get to our table, disappear to who knows where, and seem completely annoyed when others arrive even though we gave them a heads up.  They have delivered food without silverware, forgot drink orders and failed to grab any empty glasses or plates.  The girls act like we give bad tips or something, even though every week we tip more than our fair share.  It just... boggles our minds. Besides the staff, the food is always good.  Never bad, or fantastic, but consistently good.  So that's something at least. If you come here, sit in the restaurant section if you want better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-longmont-2,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006

The ahi tuna crisp with guacamole appetizer was amazing!  I never in a million years would have expected such quality from a chain?  We also had the warm pretzel/cheese appetizer on the waiter's recommendation.  YUM - I could eat those all day long! The food and service were both top notch.  The next time I am near a TGIF, I will probably stop in again.  Thanks for the great experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-longmont-2,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005

22,Brittany B.,"Longmont, CO",2,66,,1.0,2013-09-26,"sad to be writing this review, normally I love tgi fridays, yummy food, and (usually) great service, however, when I came in two Saturdays ago with my boyfriend and roomates, we asked to sit in the bar area. We just came in for drinks, no food. We asked the waiter (a bald guy with a beard) the happy hour specials. He told us that ALL draft beers are 2.50 during happy hour. cool right, so we all got a pumpkick (new belgium beer). keep in mind there were 4 of us at 2.50 cents...that would be around 10.00 total. well, when our bill came, somehow our total jumped to 17.00. We alerted our waiter and said he mis charged us. He then went on to tell us that only bud light and coors light were the 2.50 draft beers. Well, if we wouldve known that, we wouldnt have ordered what we did. poor poor service and very disappointed in tgi fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-longmont-2?start=20,,,,,

It was amazing. It was ciroc and sky vodka with grapefruit flavoring. The bar tender was very friendly and didn't bug us every two minutes. He was doing his flare bar-tending which was fun to watch. I had a great time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-longmont-2?start=20,,,,,

24,Shelly N.,"Longmont, CO",3,39,4.0,2.0,2014-06-23,"Good food as usual, but they really need to have more than one person waiting in the bar area. Service was slow. I won't stop coming here, but will sit in the other area from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-longmont-2?start=20,,,,,
15,Andrew S.,"Longmont, CO",21,58,49.0,1.0,2014-08-13,"When we walked in, there were about 10-15 open tables in the dining room.  The host came up and asked how many (host was a thin young guy with flat blond hair).  I said 2.  He said it would be about 10 minute wait.  What!?!?  I asked if we could just sit at any of the open tables, and he said no.  I asked why as that didn't make any sense.  He said they didn't have enough waiters.  This was 6:30pm on a weekday.  Less than 1/2 the dining room was full.  Still didn't make sense to me.  We stood in the entryway for 5 min and one of the waiters walked up and asked if we needed help.  I said we needed a table, and he said he could take us in his section no problem.  Guess the waiters who work on tips care more about serving customers than the management. Either the management didn't hire enough waiters (poor management) or this was intentional to make the restaurant seem busy (I would also call this poor management....making people wait around for no reason). I wanted to leave, but my wife insisted we stay. Later in the evening, there weren't any additional waiters, but they filled up all of the dining room, and no one complained about slow service or anything.  I think making us wait was an intentional attempt to make the restaurant seem popular. Once we had a table, service was good, and food was acceptable (not good). I wouldn't come back just because I don't like standing around for 10min while there are open tables and the waiters don't have a problem serving us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-longmont-2,,,,,

They were all delicious and I love that you can sample whichever one you want now. However the service was not the greatest, the waitress Amanda lacked to refill our drinks several times to wheer we had to stand up and get her attention because she was just talking at the server station, which is a pet peeve for me since I know she was not busy. I got the hibachi chicken skewers they're my favorite never a let down. Manager was a very friendly lady.

12,Anna K.,"Waterloo, IN",5,25,14.0,3.0,2015-04-14,"We were a table of 4. Two people ordered salad. The salad was fine. Not spectacular. The french fries were luke warm and overly seasoned. The broccoli had long stems. The baked mac n cheese was really yummy, as was the makes potatoes, steamed spinach, steak and ""lobster & salmon in cajun alfredo sauce"". The coffee was too bitter,  the whisky cake with vanilla ice cream was ok. They didn't eat it all between 3 people so... Lastly, they seemed short staffed. Our waitress didn't come to our table often enough and the coffee and water were not replenished quick enough. The greeter dude with dreads and a beard was wonderful, but for the price, the food and service at the table should have been better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-longmont-2,,,,,

11,Addison J.,"Denver, CO",0,3,,5.0,2016-08-13,"This is the best TGI Fridays I have been too, and that is not exaggeration. From the moment we walked in the host was on fire! This guy was friendly, focused, and upbeat - great host traits, and saw too it that we had a plethora of tables clean and able to be served. We opted for the bar, but not after the host with the most had made a table up - fantastic work ethic. The server we had was the most cheerful Fridays server I have ever witnessed. This dude was able to make an art out of serving up chain restaurant food - great job. The food was cooked well and not dry or sloppy. Brownie Obsession is the greatest kept dessert secret, it blows any desert out of the water any time any place.

9,William H.,"Longmont, CO",0,16,,1.0,2017-02-19,"We were a group of 12, so I understand that causes certain complications, but we did make our reservation 2 days in advance so they knew we were coming.  We arrived about 10 minutes early for our 6pm reservation and happily waited for our table.  We got our food at 7:10 and it came out meal by meal, which is somewhat understandable for a group our size.  They were out of about 1/3 of the stuff we asked for between smoothies and other menu items.  I didn't find out they were out of my food (Ghost Pepper Wings) until they arrived (with Classic Buffalo instead).  The hamburgers were unlabeled, so they had to try to guess which burger was which by what was on it, leading to at least one burger being partially eaten before they took it back, switched it out for the right one and having to re-make one burger.  We had a number of items (especially stuff after the original ordering) that we had to remind our server about.I finally signed my check and left at 7:50, two hours after we arrived. The server was earnest and seemed to be doing the best she could, but I don't know where the organization broke down.  I would not expect to go back if I can avoid it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-longmont-2,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76

2,Skip V.,"Frederick, CO",5,8,,1.0,2017-04-26,"A great night out with the family was ruined by an ""amateur"" bar manager (who calls herself ""Boo"") that made sure she followed corporate guidelines to have underage kids out of the bar by 9pm. She kicked us out!  As a former TGIF waiter I took great pride in treating people with respect and earning the right to be a ""call"" waiter who in-turn showed their appreciation with their tips. That experience helped me launch a great career in sales and I've always appreciated TGI Friday's until now, we will never place foot in this TGIF restaurant again!  A night of endless appetizers with the family (which includes three teenagers) at Friday's in Longmont, CO sounded like a great idea when suggested by my oldest. We plowed through our fair share of food, watched our favorite sports teams playing on the screens, had a check totaling more than $100. and were satisfied with the great service by our ""dub/dub"" Jamie, who was awesome. This was immediately ruined by a chunky little bar manager who calls herself ""Boo""! Without any preliminary warning she walks up to our table and demands that we must leave the bar right now! Lacking any social grace this woman displayed a rudeness and attitude that disrespected both the TGI Friday's brand and corporate parent Sentinel Capital Partners. We weren't allowed to wear our red & white striped shirts when we drove to work back when I used to wait tables for TGIF, the fact that they would allow such an inept troll to manage a restaurant and treat employees like a prison labor camp (they are all afraid of her) lets me know that it's not the same restaurant brand it used to be and I can have a great time with my family elsewhere!  I've been treated better by a McDonald's manager in a nearby Wal-Mart for buying less than $30. worth of greasy food than what my family received at the Longmont TGI Friday's! Advice to the Sentinel Capital Partners: You need to get rid of the lousy management you have there or risk closing your doors. You lost my family forever as a customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-longmont-2,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84

8,Christine G.,"Greeley, CO",37,19,6.0,2.0,2017-07-30,"Decided to give this place a try. Was less than impressed. Arrived on Sunday afternoon, about 2 in the afternoon. There were about 8 to 10 tables with guest seated. One waiter, and a hostess for the whole restaurant. My husband and I decided to give their endless apps a try. For not being that busy, it took 35 minutes from time of placing our order for our first round to be served. Frozen food, that has been heated. I got the ""New"" chicken casadillia.  It was mushy, and luke warm, although, my husband's was served hot, and fresh looking. Mine appeared like it hed been under a heat lamp for quite some time. Over the course of an hour we tried several different appetizers. Potatoe skins were hot but you can tell they were previously frozen. We have had much better. The only one worth ordering more than once was their pot stickers. They were good. Loaded bacon nachos were VERY salty, weird queso cheese, tasted off, and processed bacon bits...the waiter was friendly, but seemed over worked. Forgot that he was going to bring me ice for my warm iced tea and kept mixing up our app recorders.
