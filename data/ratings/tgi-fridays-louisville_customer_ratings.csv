62,Keri K.,"Indianapolis, IN",32,12,,1.0,2012-06-29,"I feel like giving this bar a 1 is being kind. My friends were in town for a girls weekend and were looking for a place to grab a nightcap after dinner. We thought there was no way Fridays could mess up a chocolate martini, because several bars on Fourth Street didn't have it on their menu. The waiting area was full of people, one pitiful disorganized hostess wouldn't seat us at an outside bar table, since it 'was first come, first served', but told us we couldn't have it because she needed to 'go thru the list of waiting people first' (funny-ad everyone waiting had kids, and clearly couldn't sit out there.) and there were tables for the waiting customers too. Everyone waiting, including the hostess appeared to have felt defeated in life, and really okay with waiting an indefinite amount of time. We walked out-I said later this particular Fridays needs to have their 'Forth Street rights taken away.' Step it up, Fridays-get your act together in Louisville.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-louisville?start=60,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052

Like $4 margaritas, a dollar off drinks and food, and $5 appetizers. Following a late rehearsal at the Cathedral of the Assumption, a few fellow choir members and I stopped in for a drink and some much needed food (ok....the drink was much needed too). Appetizers come in a decent size. We each got one and all shared and there was PLENTY of food. The margarita I got was perhaps more than I needed...and that is a personal thing, not a ""how they made it"" thing.

56,Courtney W.,"Louisville, KY",2,2,,1.0,2013-12-16,"I have eaten at this location a few times, mostly before events at nearby venues. After last night, I would dare not try to eat there again. With this location being on 4th Street Live, a major downtown entertainment district and within walking distance of the Yum! Center, you would think they would have their game going when someone like Justin Timberlake comes to town. Eight of us made reservations at 6:00.  The concert was at 8:00.  We sat down, ordered drinks, apps and entrees. And by the time 7:20 rolled around, we still did not have our appetizers. We saw people who came in after us eat dinners, get desserts and our waiter was nowhere to be found. We asked for a manager, but he would not come out.  The waiter said, ""I know you all have places to be, but we can't guarantee your appetizers will be out before 8:00.""   I demanded the manager to come out, but the waiter said, ""He is on the line."" I demanded again and he came out. We told him to cancel our order and we would eat somewhere else and maybe that will speed up service.  He comped our drinks, but it wasn't enough because of the hassle we went through to get to the venue on time, without dinner.

We sat at the bar and I ordered some blackberry long island type drink that was okay. My guy went with a beer and we ordered a meal to share and a side salad.  We got the wedge salad, which was pretty standard and good. It's one of my favorites, so I will often order it over others.  The steak dinner was oddly plated with different things including a bowl of cherry tomatoes. Although it didn't look appealing, it was just ok. Not expensive and not fantastic either.

The food is mostly of the frozen/heated/deep fried variety and the drinks seem to be made with overly sweet bottled mixes. However, I can say that I've attended several group happy hours at Fridays and they've all been fine. The service is always good and the food/drinks are really cheap.

44,Lauren H.,"Louisville, KY",166,290,384.0,2.0,2014-12-05,"TGI Friday's is a pretty accurate embodiment of mediocrity. It's what you'd typically expect from these types of chain restaurants. Despite the fact that I'm not overly excited about Friday's, I actually dine here quite often because my coworker's love it. I would probably never chose to come here if it wasn't for that fact. I've tried many things from the lunch menu. I usually get some sort of combination of sandwich or soup and the wedge salad. Nothing I've had has been horrible. The food is decent enough. The service is friendly enough and quick enough. The prices are reasonable enough. Friday's is fine for an occasional lunch, but it's nothing to get excited about. There are far more better options around town. As an aside, I do have one complaint. As mentioned before, I like to get the wedge salad, however, the wedge salad is not included in part of their lunch combo. The lunch combo includes a house or caesar salad (rant: the wedge and house salads are the same price on their regular menu, so I'm not sure why the wedge isn't part of the combo??). Anyway, despite the fact that it's not included on the lunch combo, I always ask if I can substitute the wedge salad. I've had three different responses to my request. 1. The most common: They upcharge for the wedge salad. 2. I was told that it's not possible to substitute the wedge salad, and that I must order it separately if that's what I want. 3. They substituted the wedge salad without any upcharge. Three totally different actions - totally inconsistent! I could just be bitter that it's no longer included on the lunch menu, but there you have my wedge salad rant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-louisville?start=40,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003

I was really, really hungry so I decided to try this place. The hostess was just taking her time seating us and when we asked for a booth, she told us that the 8 empty booths were closed but could sit in the bar area. We managed to find a booth luckily. The waiter came by, didn't bother to introduce himself or say hi, and just stood there. We guessed maybe we should just order? Okay then. The food came and it was disappointing just by the look of it. Also its kind of hard to eat without SILVERWARE. We asked a passing waitress for a set. And she said 'okay' and went off to where I can now assume to not get our silverware. One person in our party waited over ten minutes before getting up and finding a set. Other employees actually watched us trying to find silverware and didn't even offer to help. The same waitress came by five minutes later to give silverware to ANOTHER table and didn't even bother with us. Most of the order was wrong. The bread on the French dip was burnt, the salad orders were wrong and drenched with vinaigrette. We couldn't even send it back because the waiter never checked on us. The manager had to comp our whole meal after asking us what we wanted her to do about it. Whatever. This place has nothing redeeming about it.

I had to be careful with the cheese in the soup because it is so thick it is easy to choke on! I also tried a side order of mac & cheese covered with breadcrumbs that were good.  The service was a little slow and they forgot to put utensils on our table and I had to ask twice for them.

TWICE I had to ask for lemons again and at the end of the night when I got my bill I had been charged $8.29/ea for Grey Goose!  BARTENDER TIP! When someone orders Vodka & Soda or Rum & Diet or Bourbon & Coke you have 2 options: 1) Ask them if they have a brand preference 2) Pour and charge them for well liquor. It was HORRIBLY OFFENSIVE that the bartender saw us as easy marks for a bigger tab and recommended the server to ring in the MOST expensive Vodka in house.   If you are going to treat people like tourists AT LEAST make sure they have out of state IDs. TGIFridays on 4th St gets a 3 instead of a 1 for a couple reasons: 1) Pot Stickers and Potato Skins are still delicious 2) Drinks were not weak 3) The manager fixed my bill and apologized and my cost per drink was $4.50/ea as it should have been in the first place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-louisville?start=20,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.412,2.52

I had the pecan crusted chicken salad, my buddies had burgers.  The burgers were delivered but the salad was not.  Our server was preoccupied at the computer kiosk with her associates, making getting her attention difficult.  No tea refills and no silverware characterized the service: bored and indifferent.

I looked at her and said umm can we have a booth please, I got a nasty look and snide remark that I should of said that in 1st place, I said back maybe if I was asked in the 1st place I would of.

But here the thing the food was nasty the service was bad. I had to ask the host after she seated her guest to get me a Sprite. Our server only came around maybe twice the whole time.

16,Mike E.,"Portage, IN",0,16,,1.0,2016-04-02,"I don't expect much from the big chains and this establishment definetly didn't deliver much.  1.Upon arrival the hostess seemed confused as to what tables were available, despite the fact that at 930pm the place was only 30% full.  2. The waiter was somewhat between unfriendly and rude.  3. Waited 15 mins for drinks and 25 mins for the 2 appetizers we ordered.  4. My lady accidentally spilled her drink and after hunting down our unfriendly waiter, he flung a pile of napkins at us and walked away, no one else came to assist, we cleaned up the spill and put the pile of soaked napkins on a plate on our table. 5 mins after we cleaned up the mess the waiter offered to make her a new drink, which took another 15 mins to arrive, my soda was empty this whole time and never got refilled, despite my request.  5. The 2 tables on either side of us all had problems with their checks, some items not there, some extra items added, and needed 3 revisions before being close to accurate.  Hostess ignored us as we walked right past when leaving. I suspect my facial expression showed my opinion of this dining experience.  In short, this is a prime location for such a poor restaurant, walk a few feet either direction to somewhere else, downtown Louisville has a number of great options!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-louisville?start=20,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.084,2.52

We arrived around 10pm. We sat in the bar area at one of the high tops. The hostess came over to let us know our server would be over shortly.  Within a few moments he came over. We asked for three waters and three beers. The waters came immediately. 30 minutes later the beers came.  We soon realized that our waiter was taking care of the entire bar area and the bar tender was taking care of peope at the bar.  So we moved to the bar thinking the service would be better.  So we placed our order. Avis Criss Gordon ordered the Sizzlin Chicken, Tyrone ordered the Cheeseburger and I ordered the Chicken Tenders.  40 minutes later our food arrived. The French Fries were cold and the Tenders were under cooked and the Sizzling Chicken had sizzled out, burned, and cold. When I brought this to the bar tenders attention his response was i didn't cook it nor did i serve it, I just took your order.  WHAT??? We couldn't believe what we had just heard and witnessed. The MOD came over and apologize and attempt to make things right by taking care our meal.

It was 2 in the afternoon so it was really slow but for some reason it took 5 minutes for anyone to say hi and greet us. 3 different employees walked by and never said a word.  When we were finally seated our server was quick and had great suggestions for our meal. I had the chicken and shrimp with the jack Daniel's sauce and it was to die for. The potato skins were okay.

From reading the reviews, I didn't expect good service or good food here. However, I was surprised. I had a flat iron steak with fried shrimp, broccoli, and mac and cheese. Both sides weren't seasoned with salt, but the steak and shrimp were very good. My sister had sizzling chicken and cheese, and my mother had a rack of ribs with fries and coleslaw. Neither one of them complained about their food. Our server, Kaela, was very friendly and got us what we needed when we asked. I don't know if this is typical of the restaurant since I read many less than favorable reviews on Yelp.

This specific location on Fourth Street Live has been a convenient place for lunch ever since I was in high school. Lately, it's gone a little bit downhill.   I'm really big on friendliness of the personnel, and here is a hit or miss. I've had a few great servers and bartenders, but normally the staff I encounter don't have much energy and look like they would rather be elsewhere.    I came in for lunch with my dad. Once we were seated, there were 6 employees sprawled out at the tables and booths next to us hanging out. I can totally get if someone's on their break, but they were there the entire time we were...    Their appetizers are probably the best part. From spinach dip to pretzels with bier cheese, you get a pretty nice selection. The entree was alright, I ordered the baby back ribs with fries. The portion size was oddly small. I finished everything and was still a little hungry (usually I can't even get past a plate of ribs before giving up!)   It's a fine place to go for a regular traditional lunch, but not anywhere that will amaze you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-louisville,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

4,Whitney B.,"Decatur, GA",59,18,12.0,2.0,2017-04-22,"My friend and I came here before a show at The Palace. I'd seen the advertisements for the unlimited $10 apps and was curious about them. I got there around 6:15 on a Friday night and there was a 30 minute wait. We put our name in and ended up getting a table after only 15-20 minutes, which was nice. Our server introduced herself to us after 5 minutes of waiting for someone to come to our table. This was particularly frustrating since we were on a strict timeline to make it to the show. When she explained that you can't share the appetizers and EACH person must pay $10, I was a little turned off. I only ended up getting the apps and got potato skins and boneless BBQ wings as my refill. The first app is a full order and the second is only a half order. For this I was thankful, because otherwise the portions would have been much too large to eat alone. I ate the wings first and they were way too salty with minimal sauce. The potato skins were bland and seemed to have been sitting in the back for a few minutes before being brought out. I couldn't eat all the skins by myself, and wanted to try a different app,but our server didn't return for quite a bit. By the time she did, we needed our checks.  Not sure if I would want to try this place again, but if I did, it definitely wouldn't be on a Friday night when I'm on a time crunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-louisville?start=20,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

I can't understand why restaurant don't​put more emphasis on the side items. Also we thought the flatbread was over priced at $9.49, that was only .49 cents less than my sandwich. Not a good value.

There were 3 hostesses 5/12/17. Can you hire any less quality people? I doubt it! With a line in the little lobby, the 3 ladies giggle as a group of 3 guys walked by and the girls wanted the guys info while writing their own digets down. Then one of the ladies (neck tattoos galore) go running after the guys with another girl soon to follow. The third hostess disappeared. Soon a few of the wait team came looking for customers. After the hostesses finished their smokes and texts, they came back in (not washing their hands by the way). These ladies are as worm as a week old corpse. After the 45 minute wait (which was actually 1hr 15 min) we are seated. Ten minutes after being seated our uninterested server showed up. No sense of urgency. We are seated at a table with a City of Louisville orange street cone right by it (carpted floor). Ten more minutes for drinks, and a half hour for food. Food was ok, one saving grace. This place needs to look at their operations. I know it is in a busy spot, but you need staff to work with, not just in numbers but with quality and interested people.Staff to the needs of the business. I get that everyone has a bad night, but this is the third time in 6 months I have visited Louisville and come to this Fridays and got the same service, the ONLY reason i have gone back is because the wait at Fridays is shorter because people just don't consider going there.
