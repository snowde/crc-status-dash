4,Anna L.,"Maynila, Philippines",42,273,622.0,3.0,2015-04-29,"My friend decided that she needed a drink after her law class. The nearest and most complete bar we could think of was TGI Fridays. They have everything from cocktails to really hard drinks. My friend ordered whiskey and I watched her drink it in one go. The food here is okay. It tries to be fancy but nachos is still nachos no matter how hard you try to make it classy. The salads taste fresh enough and the burgers are really filling.  I've been to this restaurant/bar many times already. The service is also fast and you won't have to wait a long time for your drinks or food. The longest wait I've experienced here was fifteen minutes. Not bad at all. What really surprised me today was that they had a kiddie crew serving the customers. Yes, it is summer and kids get bored at home. But is it the right place to have kids serving customers who drink and smoke? That made my visit today rather uncomfortable.  If you do decide to drink or eat here, be sure to have money with you. You might be surprised with you bill when you finally have to pay for what you ordered. Go for the drinks though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-makati-3,,,,,
3,Janella Marie I.,"Manila, Philippines",37,138,324.0,4.0,2015-06-04,"Thank God It's Friday's. That seems to be the case whenever I'm in TGIF. I am a HUGE fan of their salads and appetizers. In fact, just ordering those plus a bowl of rice and I'm solved. I seriously wouldn't make it to the main course, which is what happened (again) when my family celebrated my sister's birthday here.  She was also surprised with a wonderful birthday song by the staff and an ice cream dessert. Having a natural sweet tooth, I got envious, so I also ordered something sugary, which was the Oreo Ice cream thing. All in all, I can summarize that dessert to one word: Heaven.  I guess the only thing that sets me off at TGIF is how inconsistent their Jack Daniel's sauces are. Every branch, it's a different taste, different levels of spicyness. Sometimes, the sauce is even sugary. It's like a total downer. Then again, maybe I'm just spoiled by the quality of my brother's version. it was like a secret family recipe that I can see being passed on from generations to generations that sadly, TGIF will never be able to achieve (for my own taste buds). The price isn't really much of a problem to me because I get huge discounts through a bistro card, but yeah, this is a pretty expensive place. But if you need to splurge for a huge celebration, it's worth every thousand.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-makati-3,,,,,
2,Dennis Carlson L.,"Manila, Philippines",62,281,1520.0,3.0,2016-05-10,"I wondered if there's a different vibe when you visit Friday's on a Friday, so I went to check it out. I felt that during Fridays, the backround music is more lively and the staffs are livelier, giving the customers something to look forward to after a week's work.  I love nachos and I order it anytime I see one. Fridays's Nacho Grande is the bomb. I munched on it while waiting for my wife who is stuck in traffic. I love how the toppings were generous enough to top the fried corn tortillas until the last bite. The melted cheeses were a great addition because they bind the nachos together and made it more appetizing. Highly recommended!  When my wife arrived, we were both too tired to really eat anything so we just tried their Yucatan Chicken Chipotle Salad. The serving was enough for the both of us since it was the only thing we ordered. The chicken was tender and spiced well. The lettuce was crisp. The only problem we had was their was too much dressing and made the dish too salty. Otherwise, it was good.  Service was okay. It was a busy night and we were seated somewhere on the sides where there were less servers who made rounds.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-makati-3,,,,,
0,Martin L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,,3.0,2017-05-02,"It's not going to win any awards for its contributions to the culinary arts, that much is sure... but there is a definite need for places that are open late, serve passably good food, are clean(ish) and serve drinks. In that aspect, this place is what fits the bill -  Perfect for a break with your team after working an all-nighter on that proposal or presentation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-makati-3,,,,,
1,Sam W.,"Historic Ybor, Tampa, FL",0,2,,1.0,2017-11-27,"Fridays is a chain restaurant from the states.  The food is comparable to what you would receive anywhere in the 50.  Unfortunately, the service in the Glorietta 3 mall is probably the worst I've ever witnessed.   While always polite and courteous, it seems as if bar staff aren't expecting a customer to have more than one drink.   They will hand you a menu, then completely forget you afterwards.  If the bar was full and extremely busy, this isn't an issue.  But when there are 4 bar personnel, an empty restaurant and you have to wait 20 mins to be served again, it's a bit frustrating.   There's a place across the hall where bar staff are much more attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-makati-3,,,,,
