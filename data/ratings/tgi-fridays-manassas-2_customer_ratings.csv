54,Johanna D.,"Manassas, VA",0,9,,1.0,2012-01-28,"Now keep in mind I have not been here in a couple years so the staff may be completely different (hopefully), but about 5 years ago when I frequented this place, the food was mediocre and the staff all seemed to be indifferent to their customers and were more concerned about their inner-circle social dramas than doing their job.   On one occasion I'm pretty sure our waiter was hung-over or high; he took our drink orders with his eyes half-shut while grunting monosyllabic responses. After he took our drink order, we waited for about 15 min only for him to come back and ask what I had ordered again because he forgot (I'd just asked for a water).  That was just our drinks.  For my dinner, I asked for the flat iron steak, rare without the Jack Daniels sauce.  I had to send it back THREE times:  1st time: well-done with sauce on it.   2nd time: well-done without sauce.  3rd time: rare with sauce on it.  4th: finally got it right. This is the first and last time ever I had to send food back because I generally hate to be that ultra picky customer, but this was ridiculous.  And I realize it's not my waiter's fault because he doesn't make the food, but each time I sent it back he was not apologetic or even nice about.  He acted annoyed with me even though each time the steak was clearly not what I ordered. Well-done and rare are pretty far apart on the done-ness spectrum of steak, and it's sort of obvious when something has sauce on it and when something does not.  My boyfriend at the time was finished eating his meal by the time I finally got my food brought to me correctly prepared, and I had to actually ask  my waiter if we could get a discount or something since it was screwed up so bad so many times.  He rolled his eyes and said he'd have to check with his manager.  Good news is I didn't have to pay for my dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manassas-2?start=60,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052

I made sure to tell the hostess we wanted to be seated at ""the bar section for happy hour specials"" and she replied it was a 15-20 minute wait for that area, which was completely fine. We waited and were seated in the dining room area, before getting comfortable, I asked the young man who sat us if it was okay to sit here for the happy hour specials because we asked to be seated at the bar and he replied ""yes, it's fine"". So our waiter comes, we ask about drink specials and I ask if the ""potstickers were apart of the happy hour special"". He says ""unfortunately, we don't serve happy hours special in the dining room"". I inform him of what the other worker said and he repeats the same thing. I ask if there was a manager he could ask or we could speak to. A manager just so happened to be wiping off a table near us and we tell him the situation. He says he will be back after speaking to the waiter and his demeanor is as if he is going to rectify the situation. The waiter returns to the table and says ""unfortunately we can not serve the happy hour special in the dining room, but we can allow you 2 drinks at the happy hour prices"" clearly not budging, he repeats the same thing. Needless to say, we left before ordering anything and will not be returning to this location.

8,Scott H.,"Manassas, VA",215,561,90.0,2.0,2014-03-03,"I typically would not go to TGI Friday's. I can't remember the last time I went to one. And I had no intention of going here last week. I was on the PRTC commuter on the way home from the WFC Metro when suddenly ... mother nature called. And she didn't just call ... she knocked. LOUDLY. I had to take the first stop off the bus when it got into Manassas and go to the nearest public establishment I could find. And that was Friday's. After answering the call, I was pretty much stuck there until my wife picked me up, so I figured I'd take a seat at the bar until I could reach her.  To my surprise, the bar provided a couple of passable selections for brew. Of course, it's heavy on the usual NASCAR suspects, and big imports and microbrews - Stella, Blue Moon, Sam Adams (Lager and Rebel IPA) - but they did have Flying Dog Raging Bitch and Devil's Backbone Eight Point IPA. It's a predictable selection, but better than some of the other chain restaurants, and was a nice surprise.  Friday's does have great happy hour specials on food. Unfortunately, that food is a bit hit or miss. They were offering a number of their appetizers for $3 - a Thursday special - and decided to order their White Cheddar Beef Queso dip. It was pretty good, and a nice portion for the price.  Shortly after, I reached my wife. She was hungry so I suggested we stay and try some of the other appetizers. I had just placed an order of fried green beans, a spinach flatbread, and sirloin hibachi skewers. The skewers were good, but a small portion ... I would be unhappy if I paid full price for this. The flatbread was good, but nothing special. The fried green beans were fine for the first couple of bites, but my wife noted they began to ""taste like the fryer"". And she was right. Overall, all of the food was passable, but nothing stood out as something I would come back for again.  I will say that the service behind the bar was outstanding - so much that I'd bump them for 2 stars to 2.5 stars. But while Friday's was acceptable for passing the time in an emergency situation, nothing here had me rethinking my opinion of Friday's or make me want to come back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manassas-2?start=40,1.6720000000000002,1.6720000000000002,1.6720000000000002,1.6720000000000002,1.6720000000000002

I have been when it is good and I have had fair. This Fridays is huge compared to others I have been to but they are usually well staffed. The menu changes pretty regularly. Unfortunately one thing that stays is the Jack Daniels bbq. It is too sweet and more of a glaze than a bbq sauce. I do really like their buffalo wing sauce though. It is almost as good as Glory Days.

Lobster tails tasted good and freshly grilled...but very small. It was more like a steak and mutant crawfish dinner. Our server/bartender (tall guy kinda quiet) was nice.

There was 4 in our party (2 adults, 1 teen and a child). We got an appetizer (the pick 3 trio): mozzarella sticks, pretzels with cheese dip and boneless wings. The pretzels and mozzarella sticks were amazingly delicious! The boneless wings were a bit overcooked. I ordered the Parmesan chicken entree which came with a tomato and mozzarella salad and macaroni and cheese. The macaroni and cheese was okay, the tomato and mozzarella salad was quite good but the chicken once again was overcooked and dried. My teenage son got the half rack of ribs and sirloin steak with fries and broccoli. His steak was a bit undercooked for his liking, but he ate it anyway. Our daughter's cheeseburger was so dry I could hardly cut it, but she liked the fries. My s/o ordered the Club sandwich and really enjoyed it. We got the brownie for dessert. It wasn't as big (and didn't look much like the picture), but that's typical. The staff was polite. Tara was our waitress and there was another waitress in training.

Walking in I notice the restaurant is a little messy.  I notice a decent amount of tables littered with dirty plates and empty glasses.  I also notice the floor is in need of a sweep as there was plenty of food and rubbish scattered about.  I don't let this sway me.  I reach the bar and settle in and notice they have a special on Monday nights  1/2 off Martinis.  Score.  So I finally get the attention of the bartender who explains they only do the special until 10 o'clock.  I said lucky for me buddy it's hardly even 8.  He goes on to say sorry I have had a really long day.   I have had long days myself and can't recall losing two hours.   I order the Espresso Martini, which is normally $6.00, but is $3.00 right now.  He explains to me they are out of martini glasses.  Hmm, I was not aware that the glass was included with the drink!  That after you consume your beverage, pack your glasses up with your leftovers!  No, you are not out of martini glasses, you just aren't washing them.  I said whatever just get me the drink.  The martini wasn't bad for $3.00, although I would have never paid $6.00.   My mind was telling me to pack it up but it was still early and I figured I would get one more since it was so cheap.  I should have listened to my mind.  Go figure.  I ask the bartender for one more, he grabs the receipt he has sitting in an empty glass in front of me, proceeds to add another drink to it, prints new receipt, tosses old receipt, and walks away to the other side of the bar.  Wait where is he going?  Why is he talking to another employee?  What?  Now he is getting a drink for someone else at the other end of the bar?  About 5 minutes pass and he makes him way back to where I was seated and I yell out hey buddy you going to make that drink for me or what?  He looks confused, but I guess quickly remembers and begins apologizing through the means of telling me all of his problems like ""it's been a long day"", ""this is my second job"", ""I am the only bartender, and I have to get drinks for everyone, including the customers at the tables.""  Yeah I know how the job of bartender works geeze. Lastly he tells me he is going to quit his other job so he can focus on this place.  I'm not sure he is making the right decision.

Our host was very friendly, and our server was more than happy to explain the menu to us.  We don't want to get our server in trouble but our server was more than hapy to help us with the $3 long island tea and $3 margarita, eventhough we weren't sitting in the bar.  Wife ordered the $10 endless appetizers.  My wife says the boneless chicken wings with garlic and parmesan cheese was good, and Sriacha buffao wings were too spice.  The flatbread pizza was also pretty good.  Fried dumplings were to dry.  Mozzarella sticks were okay.   Our server got a good sense of timing.  After my wife finished one app, our server had another app ready to serve.  I had the ribeye with Jack Daniel sauce, and the sauce was soooo good.  The mac and cheese with bread crumbles on top was pretty good.  The coleslaw was okay.  Our friends enjoyed the Mahi Mahi and the ribs. Overall, the service was awesome.  The drinks were good and the food was pretty good.  We definitely plan to come back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manassas-2?start=40,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002
21,Andreas L.,"Strasburg, VA",14,4,,1.0,2017-04-02,"The management needs to be replaced!!! We had to wait 30 minutes for a table despite there being available tables. Then after ordering. We had to wait for our first courses of appetizers for over 45 minutes. Some of our next round of appetizers came out cold! So we had to send them back. When we ordered refills on our drinks, our waiter being poorly trained had forgotten them couple times and then we were told they had to reuse the cups. First off that is unprofessional and disgusting for a sit down non-fast food restaurant. As we were leaving at 9:00 a couple walked in and were told to wait 45 minutes, even though the place was at most a third full.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manassas-2?start=20,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002

61,Haley B.,"Centreville, VA",10,70,100.0,4.0,2017-05-04,"Okay I know it's just a TGIF but I mean $10 for endless appetizers... you can't go wrong (although unless your a 200 lb man or any man really you're not going to eat all those potato skins no matter what you think). Okay- here's a tip: it's never actually on the menu but you can order a mudslide at TGI Fridays and they're delicious (I mean maybe all mudslides are pretty much delicious) but that's what I always get. ALSO TGIF has a new drink the ""Boba Long Island Ice Tea"" and basically it's a Long island ice tea with ""bubbles"" aka juicy bursts of mango in it. I'm not saying you should start getting your bubble tea at Fridays... but it's fun. Also shout out to our waitress Angelica who was awesome. Tip your waitresses well y'all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manassas-2,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0

23,Martha O.,"Virginia Square, Arlington, VA",12,4,,1.0,2017-06-12,Horrible experience. The hostess was very unprofessional claimed to two associates and a guest that I was rude and gave her attitude when all I asked why a different customer was service prior to me.. Because of her she made me feel extremely uncomfortable and sat us at the worst table possible.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manassas-2?start=20,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96
22,Manuela D.,"Manassas, VA",1,32,10.0,3.0,2017-06-15,"We hadn't been to a Fridays in several years. Mainly because of the food quality. In kind of a  last minute decision for dinner we decided on Fridays. The only reason I am giving them 3 stars is because of their service. The hostess greeted us and was very pleasant. Our server was very attentive asking if we needed refills, making sure we were satisfied with our meals. I even asked if the spinach was frozen and he was willing to go check. I didn't have him check. I just went with something different. The food....was a disappointing. I ordered the grilled salmon without the parmesan butter. I substituted the spinach for the tomato mozzarella salad. For the price, the portion size of the salmon seemed a bit high, but that wasn't the most disappointing. There was no flavor. I had to add salt. The same for the tomato mozzarella salad. My husband ordered the ribeye. It was cooked unevenly. He ordered it medium and it went from well done on one end to rare on the other. The mashed potatoes were thick enough to use as spackle. Luckily, our server was friendly and we were able to forgive some of it. We probably won't be going back any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manassas-2?start=20,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
69,Sam L.,"Centreville, VA",1,9,,1.0,2017-06-21,"I'll say the drink specials are decent. That's about it. I wouldn't recommend eating here.

66,Chris R.,"LaBelle, FL",0,8,,1.0,2017-08-07,"I think this location only survives because of its proximity to hotels.  We have been here more than once and the service has always been poor.  Tonight we sat at a high table near the bar.  It was not busy; but we waited to order drinks, waited to order food, waited a long time for food, waited for refills, and waited to pay.  Often we had to flag someone down because no one checked on us.  There were two servers/bartenders in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manassas-2,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96

64,Jessica J.,"Bristow, VA",0,3,,1.0,2017-10-09,"Worst place I've ever been too. Rude staff, even worse management. The only one who seemed to genuinely care was the bartender. Oh that's right, I had to get up to go to the bar to get my family non alcoholic beverages. Waited over and hour for soup, salad and a steak. 6 different people tending to our table. Manager and waitress were observed chit chatting with another table the entirety of our dinner, bouncing a baby around the bar and not washing hands after playing with said child. Worst possible experience as a pregnant woman who just wanted the endless apps, and a soup and a salad. FIRE THE NIGHT TIME MANAGER ASAP. I've never had a good experience at this location with the same manager on the floor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manassas-2,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2

We've come here a few times and we enjoy the drink specials and even some of the food but the service was never great. This time we sat down in a booth by the bar and we were there for 15 minutes and no one came to our table, the bartender even came from around in front of the bar and walk right past us and didn't even give us one look we promptly got up and left.

75,Jo M.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,18,,4.0,2017-11-02,"We took our grandchildren here to celebrate both of their birthdays.  First, I will say there were six in our party and our server Jamil didn't even write down our orders and they were complicated.  We really expected to have some mix ups but everything was perfect even down to my granddaughter's seltzer water!   So after we were finished and waiting for our bill my daughter took our grandson across the street to pick up Baskins birthday cake and our 12 year old granddaughter stayed with us.   Well, she had wrapped her ""braces"" in a napkin before eating and when Jamil came to take away some empty dishes the napkins went with them.  We realized it about 5 minutes later and were freaking out.  The manager, Jamil and other servers all pitched in to find the ""braces""...... This was just awesome for the manager (don't know his name) and his employees to all work together.   I applaud them all!   The food was all delicious... mozarella sticks, sliders, sizzling chicken, sirloin steak, broccoli cheese soup...Thank you again !!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manassas-2,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
60,C M.,"Bethesda, MD",582,80,290.0,4.0,2017-11-09,I had a great meal! The ambiance was awkward and different than any other Friday's but it worked. I almost couldn't find the boat  but it was up against the wall.  I went for a good old burger and that's exactly what I got.  I debated on going for the new Mac and cheese burger but I wanted pork so the bacon  burger  did the job.  My wife got ribs and I didn't get to try them but if I do I'll give them a review. The burger was cooked to perfection and the service was okay.  We ordered some soup after seeing the waitress bring some to another table but incidentally our food came out first so we canceled the order. Because who wants soup after your entree?!?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manassas-2,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
