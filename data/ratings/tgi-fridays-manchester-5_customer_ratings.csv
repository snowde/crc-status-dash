0,Scott D.,"Manchester, United Kingdom",136,119,17,4.0,2013-07-10,"Usually we go to TGI Fridays just off Market Street. Rachel served us today, who was really friendly and efficient, as a regular to TGI Customer elsewhere (weekly basis) I have to say that Rachel provided the best service we've experienced in a TGI restaurant so far.  Food was piping hot and was really nice.  I took advantage of a 2 course meal offer that runs Mon-Thurs costing Â£14.99",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-5,,,,,

Flame grilled burgers typically pulled pork added at every opportunity . It does shine with it's bar staff and quite frankly I use it as a bar when waiting for people to come off the motorway as a meeting place. I recommend a manhattan :-),https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-5,,,,,
