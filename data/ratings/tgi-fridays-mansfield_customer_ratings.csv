42,Beth R.,"Boston, MA",158,393,111.0,3.0,2012-02-17,"I have always liked TGI Friday's, but this location is sub-par to the others I've been to.  We had the appetizer sampler and that was just ok...some items on the plate weren't even warm.  The chicken entree that I ordered was ill-prepared and very fatty, I was pretty disappointed.  However, the #1 thing that put a damper on our dinner was the waitress.  We sat at a high table in the bar area and ordered drinks right away.  After perusing the menu for a bit, the waitress came over and we told her that we were sorry and needed more time.  She came back a couple more times, one of them being when we ordered the app and another with us explaining that we still needed some time to decide because we'd been talking quite a bit.  Every single visit she made to our table without us giving our meal choices, left us with a sour taste for she acted aggravated at our indecisivenss and seemed to even roll her eyes as she walked away.  The same went for after dinner; we sat and chatted awhile and sipped the last of our cocktails.  She had given us the check and when we hadn't settled it right away, she came over and asked if we could do so.  My friend and I are not ones to complain, so we gave her our credit cards in hopes that she'd relax a bit.  Fifteen minutes later, we had to wave her down again because we decided to have one more drink...she hadn't asked us before she'd jumped the gun and delivered the first check and she definately wasn't paying us any mind after we paid it either.  Really snippy and awful customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield?start=40,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508

31,Andrea D.,"Foxboro, MA",8,5,,1.0,2012-10-29,"This had to be the worst restaurant and experience. We were the second people in the restaurant and to start off we ordered orange juice for my son. It came and was completely sour.  Next, we ordered an appetitizer; spinach dip, well that got sent back because it was still half frozen and ice cold.  Lastly, when our meals came the French fries were cold. How could this be since we were the only ones in there. The kicker is when we asked to speak to the manager, Vicki I believe her name was, was rude; cutting us off when we spoke, not helpful in the slightest bit and actually made us feel by the end of this experience that this was our fault.

32,Alex O.,"Mansfield, MA",6,9,,1.0,2012-11-12,"One of the worst dining experiences I have had. My two companions and I got the ""Never Ending Lunch"" which was to have soup, salad, drink and breadsticks. I ordered a ceasar salad which turned out to be a house salad with ceasar vinaigrette. The order of 3 soups and 3 salads took over 45 minutes to come out. When it did finally come out, each person got theirs intermittently with 2 to 3 minute gaps. The soups were bland. We had to remind the waitress about the breadsticks which came out frozen in the middle. The waitress never asked about drink refills until about an hour and a half of being there. When we did get the bill, they charged us for the soft drinks which were supposed to be included with the meal. The long wait for service was suprising as the place was half empty. I would recommend staying far, far way from this place if you are looking for a decent lunch spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield?start=20,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212
40,Kate O.,"Mansfield, MA",73,14,8.0,1.0,2012-11-12,So I went out for lunch today with my siblings and niece to TGI Fridays and was reminded as to why we never go here. It was below par. Normally you go to a chain restaurant because it will at least be ok. This was not the case.Today I ordered a soup salad combo. I figured it would be quick and easy. It's not like they make the soups from scratch right? It was eh at best. And it only took them a quick 45 minutes to serve it. My siblings ordered a Caesar salad as a starter and the dressing was gross and they put tomatoes on the salad. They also got soup which took forever as well and their breadsticks that were supposed to come with it weren't served till 20 minutes after the soups and must not have been nuked long enough because they were still ice cold in the center.  We were never offered refills on our drinks and the waitress waited 20 minutes to check on us after the meal had been served to see if we were ok.  I was less then impressed with both the food and service here.  The only highlight of the meal was hanging out with my niece who was a nice distraction for the lack of service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield?start=40,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212

22,Edward B.,"Franklin, MA",5,4,1.0,5.0,2014-12-20,Went to TGIF in Mansfield and first we had to wait for a table for about 10 minutes. It was not crowded and they had 2 young people up front as host and hostess. The guy told us it would be a couple of minutes for him to clean off a table. 10 minutes later he came back and sat us at a table that should have taken 2 minutes to clean. The waiter Steven came over ask for drinks and left and came back shortly with our drinks. He took our order and we waited 20 minutes for a chicken salad for my wife and a jack Daniels chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. My fries and chicken Sandwich were ice cold. He took them back and within 5 or 6 minutes another person brought back a hot chicken sandwich and very hot fries  makes me wonder then why it took so long the first time and to get cold food,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield?start=20,,,,,

23,Mike D.,"Mansfield, MA",0,10,1.0,1.0,2015-05-15,"This Fridays has literally been a staple in my diet for the past five years. Now i don't think one bad outing deserves a death sentence for the entire establishment, but I do feel that the hiring and training managers need to be demoted to washing dishes and cleaning the pubic hairs off the urinals in the men's room because the waiter they rolled out for me and my siblings deserves to be tarred and feathered.....just the creepy way he took the food order created an awkwardness that compares to walking in on one of your parents naked. Yet I get that not everyone is cut out for what they do and are just trying to make a living, so I don't put a ton of emphasis on the ""weirdo"" vibe this bro gave off. His problem was that he was just a terrible waiter. There was no one else in the place (lunchtime) and for some reason he didn't ask if anyone wanted a drink refill when taking our food order even tho we all had empty glasses. So we sat there waiting for about a half hour expecting our food at any minute. Then he came up to our table and informed my brother that the prime rib sandwich he ordered was no longer available. Literally 30 minutes after we put our order in!!! Then he said in a nonchalant way ""so do you like want something else?"" Kind of pissed and caught off guard my brother just said ""ahhhhhhh I don't know, I don't even have a menu..."".....we discussed that the rest of our burgers were probably already sitting in the window and it really didn't make any sense to sit there and wait for them to start making something else...when the kid came back with a menu I said ""we're just gonna 86 the whole order,"" and made a cut throat gesture to my neck.  The kid seemed just overwhelmed with confusion as I don't think he was understanding what I meant. I thought he might just go and get us a basket of rolls or something...as he walked away probably going out back to ask someone what I meant we got up and exited.....chipotle is right across the street and I must say everything in that burrito created a medley of flavor in my mouth!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield?start=20,,,,,

8,George S.,"Holbrook, MA",81,5,,1.0,2016-08-19,"Okay, I just want to start off by saying my aunt and I used to be servers, at Bertuccis to be exact which I'm sure is fairly similar to this place. We have had our bad days and we have had our good days but there just was no excuse for the service we received today.  Oh sweet Jesus where to begin. First off, we walked in and saw a male host with a bow tie who just literally looked like he wanted to kill himself. No smile, no how are you, nothing. I'm the person who can just pick up a conversation with anyone and this guy was just not having it. He looked very confused for a minute or two and then sat us at a table which was fine. Now here's where it starts hitting the fan. We waited about 10 minutes before we even knew who our server was. Finally she came over and said her name was Jen and she seemed fine. We thought we were in good hands. My aunt was giving the drink order for herself and her two children and almost before she finished the order she tried to take off without even asking me... I know I'm pasty white but come on don't make me feel like Casper the ghost.. So I ordered my beer and we also ordered our food since we were chilling there for 10 minutes prior to the greetings. We waited about 20 minutes for the food which was completely fine, it was slightly busy so we had no issues with this. Then the food came... I ordered the jack Daniels burger which is my favorite but for some reason it tasted no better than mediocre. I got regular fries instead of the sweet potato fries I ordered but it was a quick fix. The kids food was perfect. My aunt ordered the Jack Daniels Chicken, but she received what looked to be a sandwich of some kind with jack Daniels sauce. We waited for the waitress to come back which was a little disappointing because it took awhile. When she finally came back my aunt told her what she ordered and Jen immediately took it back. The kids and I finished our meals while my aunt sat there looking like her stomach was about to cave in, finally her food came and she said it was ""Salty"". So Jen came back we didn't discuss the food much we were more focused on getting the kids dessert, we gave her the order for the ""Dirt Sundae"" (which looked very lazily put together. If I was a child I would have been pissed) and Vanilla Ice cream with gummy worms which was fine. I asked her if there was anything with peanut butter on the menu and she said no but let me get you a menu!  About 20 minutes later the ice creams come and still no menu. And no sign of Jen. The kids were about half way done when my aunt got her attention to ask for that menu which I finally got. Then she disappeared into thin air. Gone like the wind. We waited 10 minutes, no sign of Jen still. Finally after asking a different waiter where Jen was she finally appeared and  we ordered the vanilla bean cake which I debated seeing how this night was going to even get that. So we got it to go. I almost fell on the floor it must have taken a minute and a half for this cake to pop out and on to my table. So then the bill came. Jen just put it on the table and walked away. My aunt was looking at it and said ""The sandwich that I didn't order is still on the bill"" at this point I did an exasperated sigh of distraught. We waited for another 10 minutes for Jen to come back to our table. And 5 of those 10 minutes were spent talking to her co workers in the kitchen with her back to us. We literally watched this all transpire. Well she finally comes back and my aunt tells her about what felt like the 100th mistake of the night, but then returns with ""oh everyone always gets confused it says it if you look closely we took it off the bill but it still shows like its on the bill"" okay I think I heard you sigh at this point just reading that. If you knew that in advance why wouldn't you tell us that bit of information. We eventually pay the bill and looked at each other for what to put for a tip. Now we both are avid tippers and I personally feel guilty for not leaving a 20% tip but I just couldn't do it tonight. We still mustered up to give her 15% which I know, my aunt knows and you know by this point she did not deserve. At the end of this we received no good byes, no have a good night, no apologies, nothing. It's as if she just wanted us to pay the bill, get a tip, and leave.  Okay to close what feels to be a novel at this point we had a very very bad experience here with Jen and the Kitchen at TGI Fridays.

12,Jen C.,"Dighton, MA",25,25,,1.0,2016-08-19,"Normally, I think Fridays has consistent, good service & food. Not this time. It was my first visit to this particular location.  The host was great. We were seated quickly & he was pleasant. The waitress, Jen, was another story. She started out fine, but once the drinks were delivered, it quickly went downhill.  My husband ordered 2 appetizers as his meal. With all the allergy awareness, you would think it wouldn't be tough to order potato skins without cheese. They were sent back when they arrived with cheese. We had all finished eating our meals before another server brought back the potato skins without cheese. At that point, he no longer wanted them & wanted to leave.  Never once did our waitress check on our table. We needed drink refills, condiments, silverware, napkins but no one ever came.  We finally got the check & the potato skins were still on the bill. My husband brought one of our young children outside while I waited to question the server. She pointed out that the skins were removed on the other side of the folded receipt. She took our money & eventually came back with our change.  While waiting, we realized the total didn't add up. The waitress did not return the receipt with our change. When we were able to get her to bring our receipt, we saw she charged us twice for the skins, but only removed one. Then, she had the nerve to question the tip! This girl should not be in the service industry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

I'm honestly disgraced at how terrible the service is from all of the staff (except for Cheryl, who was very helpful.... see previous review).  When dealing with chain restaurants, you'd expect for the same service in all of them. I have had very, very few bad experiences with TGI Fridays in general. I've found most of them to have outstanding food, desserts, appetizers, rewards and staff members, not to mention that more and more of their restaurants have gotten complete makeovers throughout the past few years. This specific location doesn't nearly raise the bar to what is already a standard at the TGI Fridays locations in Dedham and Milford, and which is why I will not be returning here.... instead be making the drive to either the Dedham or Milford location.  1 star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
7,Rahul S.,"Lowell, MA",40,11,8.0,1.0,2017-01-27,Very bad service.. We live quite close so been there a couple of times. Have to always wait 4-5 minutes to get seated even when the place is empty. Piña colada was horrible and tasted like sugared water. I love TGIFs but just not this one.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

0,Edward L S.,"Norfolk, VA",0,22,4.0,5.0,2017-08-14,"First time at any of these restaurants but I have to say I was very impressed with this one. My friend and I decided to stop by for lunch and I wasn't disappointed. Also first time in this area (out of town on work business for a week), so you only get one chance for a 1st impression. Restaurant was very clean but I didn't care for the ""house music"" which seemed to blare all thru the establishment. Food didn't take long to arrive, I ordered a side Caesar salad (very delish). The Bourbon Barrel Chicken on a plank with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. The meal was very tasty and very seasoned. Our waitress was very polite and so was the other staff members. I would definitely recommend this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
4,Ella S.,"Needham, MA",0,3,,2.0,2017-10-21,"I went last night with my family for the ribs special they are currently offering. We were told the wait would be 15 minutes, even though only the bar was busy. That instantly told me they were understaffed. Regardless we were seated in about 5 minutes. It took over 10 minutes for our server to come over to us, and then it took over half an hour for our food to come out. The fries that came with the ribs were old and tasted terrible. When we asked for more (because we weren't given very many) we were told they were making a fresh batch...which means we got the old ones before. My own meal was a chicken dish and the sides were bigger than the actual piece of chicken. We did agree that the food was delicious once it got to us. Then the decor was gross and old. Everything looked broken, stained or worn. This place hasn't even been here that long, so I really don't understand how that could be. The color scheme was also unappetizing and dark. The servers had to buss their own tables, which made service slower. It also took them a while to get around to busing their tables, and it's gross to see people's left overs sitting around. Then we noticed about six employees all at the cash registers, punching in numbers the whole night. Having worked in food service before, I know bussers are needed...but number crunchers definitely aren't...right?? Anyway we won't be coming back to this particular Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
3,Amy L.,"Bridgewater, MA",116,1,,1.0,2017-11-24,"After a long day of Black Friday shopping my friend and I decided to stop at one of our favorite restraints, T.G.I. Friday's. We have never visited this location but decided to give it a try. We sat with empty drinks at our table for over a half hour and then waited over an hour for our food . Not to mention our food consisted of a chicken sandwich and boneless wings . Very disappointed in this restaurant",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
1,Melissa W.,"Blackstone, MA",0,6,2.0,1.0,2017-11-24,"I truly used to love this place but service has gone downhill! Here for after Black Friday shopping, it's not that busy here and dirty dishes just sit! We had to move our own glasses to the bar. I count 8 places that no one has cleaned up. There's no reason for it!!!  It just makes me not want not to come back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
