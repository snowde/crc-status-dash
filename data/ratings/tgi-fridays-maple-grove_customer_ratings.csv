11,Lauren S.,"Minneapolis, MN",16,204,,3.0,2012-09-11,I have been eating at Fridays for a long time. It is my son's favorite meal in the Twin Cities so I took him for dinner as a treat. I never know what to order because the menu is so big. I ordered one of their new mediteranean beef skewers. It was the best meal i have had there in a long time. It is my new fav and will definately order again.  Our waiter could not have been sweeter- they really train the waitstaff at Fridays well.  On the down side- my son got plain angel hair pasta and they charged me 12.00 for it. They rang it in as a chicken brushcetta without the chicken. What gives? Next time I am in they have got to figure out a cheaper way to go about that.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-maple-grove?start=20,2.54,2.54,2.54,2.54,2.54
2,Sarah G.,"Osseo, MN",0,3,,4.0,2013-01-31,"As a 'hangout' spot for us a few times a month, Maple Grove Friday's fits the bill of close to home, good food, and great service.  We sit in the bar area and the staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and the food is enjoyable.  The flair shows and other fun activities are great, but some are scheduled a little too late for me on a work night. Be prepared for a wait during the dinner rush, especially on Friday.  We've found going a little later in the evening helps. LOVE the cheesecake!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-maple-grove?start=40,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576
22,Tiffanie S.,"Minneapolis, MN",5,37,2.0,4.0,2013-03-22,"Food is premade chain restaurant food.  It's satisfying and consistent if a little overly processed. They have some fun takes on traditional bar food, like seared tuna nachos and and Korean steak tacos.   The desserts, though are fantastic!  The vanilla bean cheesecake visits me in my dreams.  And they can know how to really jazz up a boxed brownie! Some of the bartenders can flip and toss the bottles which is entertaining.  And drinks are pretty generous and reasonably priced for the suburbs.   They must have a high turn over on servers because I never see the same ones twice but that's OK they are almost always friendly and attentive.   And my favorite thing is that they are open late!!  A rarity in this area. So overall this place is a really good choice for after work happy hour, dessert, or late night munchies.  May not be a foodies dream cuisine but it serves its purpose nicely.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-maple-grove?start=20,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997

The server was very disappointing.  She seemed to not care about her tables, and forgot about us at times.  I asked if the bar could make a certain drink, she said she would check, we expected her to finish the drink order. She didn't return for like 10 minutes.   Friend ordered the French dip, and her aju was a small portion less than another persons at the table w/ same order.  When she asked for another side, she was charged.  For a cup of soup with 2.50 taken off that,  so 2.20 for a small portion of aju. We asked the server about she didn't know how to respond so she got the manager.  He then gave us some deal about inventory, which my friend and I both worked in restaurants and I currently still do, in a manager position. What he was saying was pure BS.  He then said he will talk to the server.

43,Josh K.,"Minneapolis, MN",284,261,210.0,1.0,2015-03-09,"While I generally avoid these places, it was crazy late and this was literally the only place left with a grill still on (that or Taco Bell, which, always sounds great until you hear the sounds in your toilet later).  We swing in and get seated in the bar area at a high top next to the back alley way to the server station (keep this in mind for later). After a few minutes, I'm kind of wondering if this has become self serve at the bar? At the 7 minute mark I ask Ashley if she can see me - which gets a yes. At the 10 minute mark I look back at the bartender who catches my gaze and realizes ""holy shit, someone is here!"" And the server is finally sent over. We're starting off great!  Waters are brought out, and of course, we could have read Moby Dick in the time it took to get them, so we've gone through the menu a dozen times already. I roll with surf and turf, steak-lobster tail combo with sweet tater fries. Ashley decides to try the ""new"" chicken strips. I ask for any better to be on the side, because I know these chain places believe slathering butter on everything for some reason makes them think we won't taste the quality of their food.  About 10 minutes later as we're chatting, my steak-fries show up, and Ashley's food comes out. However, my lobster tail is MIA. I could have sworn these things are the tail, and don't have legs to run away from the kitchen area, but apparently mine did. I ask the server, who completely forgot about the ""surf"" portion of my meal, and she says she'll go back and check. I wait. And wait. I insist my better half starts eating, who knows if they went to Maine to get this thing or not. So she starts in. I then start in because my stomach started reaching for my steak knife. 10 minutes go by, and the server finally comes out and says it's just about ready then heads down the alley before I can clear my mouth and say anything. 5 minutes later, she shows up with what looks like a crawfish tail and says ""here we are, enjoy and sorry."" Then vanishes down the alley again... this time leaving our waters empty.  The steak was cooked pretty well but lacked any flavor, at all. I know, without the butter topping to it, go figure. The sweet tater fries were ok and probably the best part of my meal. The crawfish tail, sorry, ""lobster"" tail, was gone in two small bites, and was overcooked to hell, tough, and luckily I had some lemon to give it any flavor.  Chicken strips were good. The new buttermilk batter is a solid thing, but, it's hard to screw up anything deep fried.  Get the check, and I laugh hysterically at it. I did see we got 20% off without asking, which was the least they could have done out of self guilt.  God damn this place for being the only place open that late without being fast food. Next time we'll just head home and cry instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-maple-grove,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000005

We ordered the Memphis BBQ Wings, Mozzarella Sticks, Loaded Potato Skins, and the Bacon Mac & Cheese Bites. The wings were in the perfect amount of sauce and had a good chicken to breaking ratio. Potato skins had the perfect amount of toppings. (My husband LOVES cheese and they satisfied his pallet) the Mac & Cheese bites were in a delectable cheese sauce.  Everything came out cooked to perfection and hot.

14,Joshua W.,"Minneapolis, MN",4,5,,1.0,2015-07-14,"Maybe an unfair review insomuch as all of the negative that I have to point out pertained to a manager.  The food was great,  as was our waitress.  The manager, however, the most unprofessional I have ever encountered...and that is saying a lot as I was literally in Chinatown San Francisco 3 days prior.  I literally listened to a drunk customer three tables away loudly say ""what,  am I f$@#ing asian? "" in response to a conversation with a manager (Matt Walsh) regarding  a hundred dollar bill. The response of the manager was to laugh out loud with the guy and a few of the others at the table.  Having my 14 year old daughter, who is asian,  stare at me wondering if I would do anything kinda made for an uncomfortable end to the evening. Myself, my asian wife,  son,  and daughter were literally celebrating our safe return from a two week road trip out west.  I then asked to speak to the manager before we left, as i felt it was warranted, and his response was to tell me that we were all hearing things wrong.  My attempt to confront him privately was responded to by him getting loud and walking into the dining area. I simply stated to him that I thought his actions in response to the man's statement was very inappropriate  and not appreciated.  He seemed to think that instead of apologizing, that a better response would be to speak over me, denying what all of us heard as well as those at the next table who were nodding their disapproval of what he was doing.  I in turn then felt obligated to apologize, as we left,  to diners whose meals were interrupted by him being overtly loud in responding to my confronting him.  An apology would have been sufficient.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-maple-grove?start=20,,,,,

44,Alyssa R.,"Monticello, MN",0,4,,1.0,2016-03-27,"Around 2:00pm yesterday afternoon, my young children and I stopped into this restaurant. It was approximately half full with the last of the lunch rush on their way out. Upon entering, I was surprised to find 4 or 5 employees standing together at the host stand. With all of those employees, you would think at least one of them would greet us but, sadly, no.... I greeted them with a smile and asked for a table. Even with all of the open tables, they seated us 3 ft from the front door and right next to an older couple. We thanked them but asked for a table or booth inside the restaurant, near many other families with kids. The tall attendant standing in front rolled her eyes at me and said we would need to wait a few minutes for a table to be wiped. She asked one of the other employees to clear the table that was on the other side of the older couple, the only dirty table in sight, even with the many other options open.  I have worked in restaurants and understand the importance of sections and seating strategically but this was ridiculous. It only takes one friendly employee with a smile.....quality, not quantity. We walked over to Freddy's and enjoyed fantastic, friendly service at a much lower price point.

Update: our friends were there a week after we were there and pretty much the same experience. They will also never be going back. Too bad the manager didn't take my suggestion to use our bad experience as a training issue. The only reason this place is getting 3 stars on Yelp is because employees must be going out there and giving 5 stars. You know how I can tell?

I've grown up near the area so this was the spot that my friends and I use to get together at.  I swung through here today, even though I wasn't hungry to meet a friend that was from out of town that just wanted to grab a quick bite to eat! We decided to choose the bar seating area (high tops) which is my personal favorite area to dine at a TGIF restaurant. The atmosphere is always great! Everyone is having fun, cheering on the gophers on tv and as well as the hockey games that were taken place. Very cheerful sports bar atmosphere but also family oriented as well!  I definitely ordered the French Dip as well as their new ""Sriracha Shrimp"" appetizer. The Sriracha Shrimp was very unique. It came out with the shrimp on top of these little ""rolls"" similar to sushi, so about 6 pieces. Under the Shrimp was house made guacamole and then the bottom of that was rice wrapped in nori (seaweed) fried. The Sriracha was cooked with the shrimp and the soy sauce style (sweeter tasting) was drizzled throughout the dish. It was not as filling for myself but different in taste and threw my taste buds for a spin! Loved it though and hope they keep it on their menu! For the French dip, your standard roast beef in a nice and actually crispy bread that perfectly was accompanied by the Au Jus which wasn't to powerful in anyway but just completed the meal! Came with a side of your standard fries so nothing too out of the ordinary.

One with potatoes and spinach; one with mac 'n cheese and spinach. We also added crispy shrimp to each entree.

It came out barely cooked. Then we got new shrimp, which we had to wait on. After cutting into our steaks, we asked for the manager. He came out, said someone was being trained in the kitchen and that's why there were issues. We asked for our food to be remade. Again, more waiting and we still didn't get the shrimp with it.

32,Nick W.,"Osseo, MN",58,1,,1.0,2017-04-08,100% will not be coming back. 3 people at our table got the endless apps for 10 bucks each and each appetizer that came out was very sub par and bland. The one person at the table that ordered an entree ordered chicken and about 3 bites it he had to send it back because it was rubbery and incredibly dry not to mention it was tiny.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-maple-grove,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
37,Nalee L.,"Minneapolis, MN",26,6,4.0,1.0,2017-04-21,"Worst hostess ever! We had a big party;9. They told us it will be a 30 to 40 min wait. That's ok, it's to be expected. But after an hour and 15 mins, we are still waiting and they have a table that can fit 14 right in front of us. The hostess said that's not for us, it's for a party of 14 who does not even exist! She told us we have to wait. Talked to the manager and she was going to give us that table but with all the kids tired, us angry we just left!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-maple-grove,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88
29,Thida L.,"Minneapolis, MN",17,6,,1.0,2017-04-21,"Food is alright and all day happy hour is great. But every single time we go here we have the longest wait time to be seated. Today was the worst! Got there at 7 with party of 9 they told us wait time was 30 minutes and they really were not that busy. Lots of smaller open tables. An hour and a half later we thought we were finally going to be seated when a big party left. 15 minutes later we still weren't seated while the table was all cleared and set up already. We asked the hostess and she said the table is for party of 14 and we don't have enough people. WTF?? Are you kidding. She wouldn't split the table up for us but seated a group of 6 that came in after us since that lady complained right away. Worse service ever. Of course we didn't stay after speaking to a manager who sit with us right away because they'd probably spit in our food!  Please teach your staff how to better seat your customers, don't just let anyone host.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-maple-grove,1.8,1.8,1.8,,1.8000000000000003
34,Vicki P.,"Minneapolis, MN",10,3,1.0,3.0,2017-04-25,I come here every week for lunch.

31,Cathy S.,"Rogers, MN",0,5,,4.0,2017-07-19,"We've always had decent service and food, here at Maple Grove TGI Fridays.  Last Thursday, July 13, 2017, we stopped in for the $10.00 apps, which we had about one month before. I asked our waitress about the $10.00 apps.  She told us they were now $12.00.  Seriously, you just started this promotion a while ago and already upped the price $2.00.  What makes this worse, is today, twice, I seen an advertisement on TV, stating their $10.00 apps.  So, what is wrong with this picture.  Either check your menu's or change your advertising on TV.  Actually, it sounds like 'false advertising'.  Waitress/waiters, menu's, advertising, should all be on the same page.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-maple-grove,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
26,Gabrielle B.,"Chicago, IL",178,76,127.0,5.0,2017-08-20,"So here's the sitch: my friend and I are road tripping. The whole paying-for-every-meal-every-day thing is getting old. Checked my reserves and found that I had a good ol gift card for Friday's. We found a location along our route and I can say this is easily the best Friday's experience that I've ever had.  The facility was very modern, updated, and clean. I was especially impressed by the lengths that the location had went to make the atmosphere feel intimate- I posted a picture of their cozy tables and arm chairs above. The bar had a granite-esque counter and was decorated with NYC inspired art.  The clientele was quiet. Nobody was loud or drunk in the bar area. Our waitress Alexis was awesome and attentive. She was quick with our order and provided updates as to when the food would arrive.  For an appetizer, we ordered cheese dip + pretzels. It was a cheddar dip, topped with bacon and scallions. The pretzels were large, warm, fluffy inside, and crispy on the outside. Delectable! Honestly, the cheese dip at Applebee's is better (if we're comparing chains), but the pretzels are way better at Friday's!    My friend had the steak smothered with jack daniels sauce- sweet and tangy, cooked to her satisfaction. Alexis made sure we cut the steak in front of her to ensure proper cooking. It felt like a proper steakhouse!  My entree was a Mediterranean naan shrimp sandwich. I'm vegetarian and the menu was very much veg-friendly. The shrimp was cooked well. Didn't love the combo of flavors in the wrap (a sweet balsamic vinaigrette and Mediterranean yogurt dip), but I didn't get too caught up on that.  Overall, this chain deserves some credence. I'd definitely recommend people giving Friday's a chance. I'm not the biggest chain fan, but Friday's is really doing a lot to shed the tacky, corporate chain feel.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-maple-grove,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
28,Kate S.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,4,,1.0,2017-10-28,The worst food I ever had. Ordered the French dip and could only eat a couple bites. Good server.  Never go to Friday's again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-maple-grove,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
