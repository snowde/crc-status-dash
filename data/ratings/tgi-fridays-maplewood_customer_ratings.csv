7,Rhonda G.,"Saint Paul, MN",1290,1296,4.0,2.0,2012-01-16,"I came here just after Christmas. They had a new turkey sandwich with weird stuff on it, whatever it was it  didn't go together well and just seemed like another experiment on their helpless customers. You are constantly captive to the constant menu changes. Drowning a steak in sauce doesn't constitute a draw for me. Now in the winter I'm constantly reminded of the omission of the delicious mac and cheese and beef stroganoff. Now I'm reduced to burgers and buffalo wings. I'm not just gonna bitch about the food. I don't like having to stroll through the bar to get to the bathroom. The worst is, remember all the construction I mentioned, it was easier to get into when it was all going on!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-maplewood?start=20,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504
12,Nikki B.,"Saint Paul, MN",2,175,7.0,2.0,2012-05-31,"First  I want to mention that the wait staff was excellent. Everyone was very friendly and followed up throughout our meal to make sure we had everything we needed.  That said I don't think the food/drink is worth the money.   $9.69 for a Margarita - premium liquor or not  - was a little high. I wasn't impressed with it, almost had more ice than drink in it.  Now that I think about it saving the almost $10 and running to the local liquor store would have been better deal.   I ordered a blue cheese burger and my hubby ordered a cheddar burger. The burger came with shoe string fries, which although I love fries was not impressed.  I guess we are used to seasoned fries, which is what we get at most of the places we normally patronize.  When I asked my husband what he though of his burger he said it reminded him of a McDonald's hamburger.  So, I guess if you like McDonalds but want a little bit better atmosphere this is the place for you.  I agree that the burger was like eating a fast food burger.    Also, we wanted to try the whole TGI Friday experience so we ordered the Whiskey Cake with sauce for desert.  We were thinking it would be similiar to Applebee's white blondie desert and it wasn't:(  The taste of the cake with the flavor of the sauce just didn't taste right together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-maplewood?start=20,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005

They taste horrible RS Me and my boyfriend came here for the endless app deal and we picked the spinach dip and the potato skins, how you can screw up on spinach dip is beyond me but it was horrible, both were sooo horrible, so we decided to make them not endless and the server asked why, and I said we didn't like them enough to have more of them, super simple, but we were starving so we did eat some of them, and we weren't asking for them to be taken off of our bill or anything crazy like that, but then the server took the half eaten apps from us and we still had to pay for them, I'm pretty disappointed :/ we left after that, fast food is cheaper and better tasting than the food at this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-maplewood,,,,,
3,Kassi J.,"River Falls, WI",11,19,,1.0,2014-08-30,"The advertisements for this place make it seem fun and inviting, but this particular location was HORRIBLE! Waited 30-40 minutes for a booth. Placed orders in for apps and main course and literally right after we got our apps, main course came! We didn't even have time to touch our apps and felt rushed to get in, eat, and get out! Appetizers were the best thing, which is sad considering we ordered onion rings. All meals were messed up. I will not go back to this location not only because of this, but because the staff was standing next to my children talking about doing drugs and getting F*ed up! Please, this is a family restaurant, staff should always be aware of their surroundings!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-maplewood?start=20,,,,,

2,Kris I.,"Saint Paul, MN",1,9,2.0,5.0,2014-12-11,This is a great place to go after work and get some appetizers or dinner. The ribs are delicious. The bar staff are terrific and friendly. We like to come in once a week and have dinner in the bar because the staff is amazing and great food choices. My favorite is their soup of the day on Fridays -it is clam chowder. We use our stripes app and get points that equal about $10 off every four or five times.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-maplewood?start=20,,,,,

20,Garrett Z.,"Apple Valley, MN",106,335,536.0,3.0,2016-01-19,"I usually only go to chain restaurants when I am looking for a safe option. You know, there is something for everyone on one of those menus and if I cannot decide on what I want, I will probably be 99% able to find something I might like. Well, we were meeting family with a lot of kids in tow, so we decided to grab a quick bite to eat at Fridays.  I had an awful experience at the one in St. Louis Park (still waiting on the manager to refund the meal, 7 months ago!) so was a bit nervous coming in here. Looks like they run this place to a different tune than the one on the West side of the metro. Employees were nice and welcoming and we were seated quickly. We were right next to the kitchen exit and server's station, which was a little annoying since we overheard EVERY bit of gossip while we were dining. Management might want to change that up or not have the servers drop every bit of drama going on in the store in front of customers. Not very appealing to guests. Anyways the food was actually pretty good for being an Applebees/Chilis/Fridays chain. It was authentic to what the menu pictured (rare indeed sometimes) and quite tasty. I had the Bourbon Plank Chicken and my wife tried the Chicken and Shrimp Skillet. We enjoyed both dishes. The one thing that was a bit shocking was the price, not our meals so much, but they tried charging $12 bucks for a burger. It better be as delicious as a Blue Door Pub burger, because other than that no chain burger is worth that much money EVER.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-maplewood,,,,,
28,Linn Y.,"Minneapolis, MN",29,9,11.0,2.0,2016-01-23,"My very first time at this place was about 5-6 years ago, and I loved it. It was great, the service, the food, portions.. I even made my family eat here for my graduation dinner.  I'm sad to say that I don't feel the same way I feel about this place or TIG Fridays anymore. The service is terrible, my fiancé and I always wait for more than what is necessary, and whenever the waiter comes he's very snobby or rude to us. The food wait is alright, but the food itself is bland, and even sometimes cold! I would say the portions are very small compared to what it used to be.  I don't think I will ever go back to eat at a TIG Fridays, because I think I can find better at better prices and tasting food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-maplewood,,,,,

Ordered steak (was good), ribs were dry sort of bitter, burger was ordered medium to well but came out over cooked so it was crumbling. Hand battered fried shrimp was superb! Drinks were great!

21,Richelle H.,"Maplewood, MN",13,6,,2.0,2017-03-02,"Expensive, small portions, slow service. We had a very slow waitress. With 2 kids this is not easy getting them to sit still. It took a long time just to get our order in. Once the order was placed we waited close to 45 mintues for our dinner. The people next to us sat down and got their food in less than 20 minutes, When our food did arrive my chicken was cold and extremly small. My Husband's chicken sandwhich was smooshed. He was not very happy about it. Our Daughter ordered a salad. The lettuce was brown and wilted. She had a very small portion of steak. Our Son had the buffalo wings. Again portion size. For what you pay you don't get very much food. We actually had dessert because the kids were still hungry. The picture maded it look like a very large brownie. There was not much in the bowl.

18,Tom G.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,15,,3.0,2017-10-28,"We were in during Saturday dinner time.  But still seated quickly.   Stopped in for the full rib rack special going on. Almost half price for full rack.  Pleased with the apps, fried green beans and the mini sliders.   Instead of fries with the ribs, up'd to onion rings and roasted brussel sprouts.  Onions rings were great, coating stayed on rings, and were larger than usual rings. Possibly double rings.  Sprouts were ok, but very salty with combination of soy sauce and feta crumbles.   The cole slaw was mostly flavorless. A mayo style with little seasoning.   Lastly and most disappointing were the racks of Jack Daniels ribs.  We realize they have a special going on and serving a pile of ribs each night.  But on both of our racks, half the rack bottom was incinerated.  Of course we both started eating from the better ends.  The tops were cooked very well.  But the cooks weren't paying attention to cooking the bone sides.   Showed our waiter and he apologized and removed a side.  No excuses were made.  So he did ok to handle it.  Hadn't been to TGI Friday for years.  The Roseville store near us closed long ago.  We went there for all sorts of occasions. Seeing the rib special we were hoping for a much better meal.  We'll see if we return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-maplewood,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

I try to be objective as possible in my own perspective. I had the blackberry margarita and the vegan Beyond Meat burger without the cheese or special sauce and with ketchup and mustard.  The atmosphere: Not bad-it is how I would expect a TGI Friday's to appear! There are canoe paddles on the walls... The service: Very good. Our server was kind, knowledgeable, and quick! I was very happy with this!  The food: I gotta tell you...there is no substitution for having a burger cooked on a grill. It gives it the perfect flavor! The burger was very good and cooked perfectly. It's quite a large burger, but I'm not complaining! The fries were seasoned very well and the margarita had a good amount of tequila that I could taste in it plus delightful chunks of blackberry. The meal was delicious!  I will come back here for the this burger, again and again.
