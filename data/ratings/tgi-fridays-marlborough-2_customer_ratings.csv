Great bartenders though, always very helpful. Always a nice location to go when you want to see a movie and grab a bite to each. Place is always good to get a beer on a Friday or Saturday night and some food before you go out. Also, not a bad spot to watch a game.

The waiter was attentive without being cloying and the manager who delivered the entrees commented on my special request so I knew it had not been lost in translation.

36,C J.,"Marlborough, MA",0,42,1.0,2.0,2013-03-15,"What is the worst day to go to this Marlboro TGIFridays?....FRIDAY! Any day that is busy this location can not handle it. Time after time when I have gone to this location on a busy night like Friday or Saturday there is a long wait but if you walk to the bathroom they have tons of EMPTY tables! Oddly they make you wait with crowds for a seat but leave tons of tables empty in the back! One time came in when no one was waiting anymore and they told me in 5 minutes I would get a table. I stood a few feet away and the host never bothered to get my name and gave my table away to 2 other couples who walked in later, cause they didn't bother to take 2 steps forward to see that me and my friend were waiting for the next available table, as we were instructed to do! Only after I complained did the host finally decide to let us have the next table, and did not bother to apologize for his screw up by not taking our name or even making an attempt to find us, 2 feet from the front door! On friday nights the service is also very slow. Don't order an appetizer because it will come out AFTER you receive your meal. On a week night this place is good, with fast service and no wait.

The service was good, met with an excellent and a polite staff. The staff worked like a well oiled machine, immediately after the guests left the booth was sprayed and cleaned and set for the next guests.

17,Mat R.,"Marlborough, MA",10,27,19.0,4.0,2015-01-06,"I always enjoy a good Friday's visit.  The atmosphere and vibe at this Marlborough location is always neat, friendly and fun. I don't drink much, and have only spent a night at the bar maybe once or twice, but I've never been disappointed.  The beverage variety combined w/ the swift and friendly bartenders make for a good experience should you decide to come here for a ball game or after dinner drinks. Lunch and dinner here are always good.  The portions are just right, and I never feel as though I overpay for what I get.  This is one of the few places that I sometimes leave with a ""leftover"" box (Normally unheard of for me). Their ""Give me More Stripes"" Rewards program is rewarding and fun.  With a companion app to go along, you can always track your points and get rewards immediately.  You also get FREE chips & salsa every visit (As long as you ask). I'm a big chicken guy - so the Sizzling Chicken & Cheese, Jack Daniels Chicken and Bruschetta Chicken Pasta are huge hits for me.  Their ribs are also amazing, surprisingly some of the best I've had given this is a chain restaurant. Definitely a good spot worth checking out!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-marlborough-2,,,,,
18,Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",161,1505,24565.0,4.0,2015-08-14,"I really liked this TGI Fridays. It was like I owned the restaurant, very few people there on a Saturday at Noon (wouldn't that be a prime time for customers?).... hope it's not a sign of them closing soon. There were only a few tables filled, and it was absolutely spotless!  Bernard was helpful, friendly, and quick (to date, this is the quickest I've EVER had to wait for a burger at TGI Fridays, and I've been to SO many), and checked in on my table periodically, which was super helpful.  In general, even though it wasn't one of the newer Friday's location and hasn't been updated for years, they do a great job with upkeep and keep the food cooking fast and exactly to order. In general it's the perfect option for a quick, inexpensive lunch at the Solomon Pond Mall where you are also able to do other shopping. How convenient. Only mall around that actually has a TGI inside, and parking is always available right outside. -1 star because of a terrible mistake that I hope is fixed. At the top of my receipt it reads ""**TGI Friday's #0730** Berlin-Marlbough, MA"". THAT IS INCORRECT. It's MARLBOROUGH. NOT Marlbough!!!! UGH! Just fix it before I come back and everything's good..... and I can update my review to 5 stars!  Update: they did a complete remodel on this location within the past few months and it looks great. New ""Friday"" style.  4 stars. Still need to make sure they fixed the receipt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-marlborough-2,,,,,
26,Mark T.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,8,,1.0,2015-08-26,"I walked into the restaurant and passed a table full of waiter and waitresses enjoying their dinner like regular customers, loud and all.  Quietness ensued as I passed by the table. A waiter from the group came to serve me, he seemed miserable that he had to leave the click.  Anyways, I normally know exactly what I am ordering.  This day, I was told that the sizzling steak is no longer on their menu; no problem/not a big deal.  I then ordered the BBQ chicken flatbread and a salad.  My bill was already printed out and placed in a shot glass (no problem/not a big deal/normal procedure). It was after 10pm and there was barely other customers ordering food (mainly drinks).  I waited for 15 minutes to be told that they there is no more flatbread by the waiter.  I settled for the salad, this particular waiter never bothered fixing the bill before clocking out.  He knows that I saw him touch the printed bill from the shot glass as though he was willing to adjust it but mnaah! He decided to be lazy about it. Ok.  When the salad was dropped off I saw a waitress hand at my peripheral dropping off the plate without a word! The waiter switched shifts with another waiter who also never said a word.  I had to crack open and break the ice and expressed my discontent at the service.  Incompetence spew.  His first excuse was, ""you were on your phone, I didn't want to bother you"" then ""(___ the other waiter rang you up, I just took over as he left...""... He was nearly throwing his coworker under the bus.  Anyway, I expressed how I did not feel welcomed and tipped big and only the waiters and waitresses working that evening would understand why I have done such a thing.  And to them I would say: I guess you can't judge a book by its cover, huh?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-marlborough-2?start=20,,,,,

I got the siratcha shrimp cob salad and it was okay.  The ship was fine but it was hardly ""siratcha"".  Also they put bleu cheese and bacon on my salad which didn't make much sense.  The bacon was obviously made much earlier in the day because it was crumbly. On top of all of this, it was about 10 dollars for a SMALL portion. What a joke.

I counted more than 10 open tables of 4, yet we were told to wait 10 minutes. After 15 minutes, we were taken to a table that was open the entire time. I get that sometimes sections aren't properly staffed, but it was just laughable to stand in a crowded waiting area while we all stared at empty tables we would eventually be seated at.

4,Sammy L.,"Hudson, MA",2,58,8.0,1.0,2017-03-05,"This chain is going downhill, fast. This restaurant in particular is always SLOW (you're looking at 1+ hours for a burger) and *dirty*. I visited this restaurant with a friend recently and BOTH of our glasses of water had green flakes (spinach? lettuce? mint?) floating in them. That was the start of our visit. We both ordered burgers. I ordered the veggie burger which I'm pretty sure is just a frozen patty bought from either MorningStar or similar. So it was fine but only because I had it without the mayonnaise and without any of the cheese they offer. My friend ordered a bacon cheeseburger with the usual toppings. The burger itself was so incredibly greasy. Before he could even bite into it, the bun was sopping wet and falling apart. The minute he picked it up, grease and cheese-slop came pouring out. It was a soggy, disgusting mess. Not the kind of sloppy mess you want your burger to be, but a form that is inedible and completely unappetizing. I am a picky eater, admittedly. But he is not. And he could not go beyond one bite of that burger. We ended up having to wait 30 minutes(!!!) for our server to come back to give us the check. Our server herself was very nice but took forever to check in on us. We never even had a chance to ask her for clean waters.

13,Danielle D.,"Sudbury, MA",181,2,,2.0,2017-05-18,"Host inept, food was good, except the fact that there was a hair in it, Leah, our waitress, was the best part of the meal, in essence, the major reason we would come back.  I went in last Saturday night to meet my parents. It wasn't busy at all, but there was a short wait. As I was the first one there, I put my name on the waiting list for a high top in the bar. I could see there was one cleaned and set and two dirty that just needed to be bussed. I've worked in restaurants for a long time, so I just figured she'd just sat that server and we were just pacing the meal.  When my parents came in we told the hostess we were going to the bar to get a drink. While we were at the bar, a couple came in and sat themselves at the clean table. My mum went up just to double check if that was an option and was informed that ""no, those tables are part of the wait"". Another person came up to the host stand and pretty much told the hostess that there was no reason to be on a wait and we would be seated. My mum asked if we would be sat at that clean and set table and was told yes, so she went and sat there, the hostess who was standing around taking names for a 3/4 empty restaurant came and yelled at her that that table was reserved and that she couldn't sit there. We asked if the table was reserved for me and she said yes, and walked away.  The meal was pretty good, except for the fact that my mum found a long dark hair in her Buffalo chicken tenders (she has short blonde hair and the waitress has long blonde hair...) and then I gave her one of mine, which also had a hair in it. The manager came over and spoke with us, letting us know they would ""get to the bottom of it"" but then that was the last we heard from him...I couldn't tell you his name.  The waitress, I'm almost positive her name was Leah, was the best part of the meal bar none. She was friendly, welcoming and a great face for this company. She was so open and honest and apologetic when things went wrong, she didn't try to pass the buck if it was her fault, she was refreshing and wonderful. I would come back if I could be guaranteed to have her as a server.  So then I did the survey on the check, I did it while we were still sitting there, just to make sure I could notate everything, especially how wonderful the service was, and there was one comment section in the whole thing ""what could we have done differently?"" To which I answered ""train your host staff"" but no comment section for anything good, not even a ""you had an issue? Please tell us about it"". And at the end it asked for my email address, I put it in the box, and do you think I heard anything at all? Nope! Not even a ""could you elaborate?"" I used to like coming here (despite the CONSTANT fruit flies), but I don't know if I will anymore, considering how little they seem to care about their surveys and guest experiences.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-marlborough-2,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

The first time I thought her overwhelming neglect was a result of being a new hire, but four months later nothing had changed. In two dine-ins at this restaurant, our waitress didn't take a single plate off our table. We went out of our way to make it easy for her by stacking everything neatly and pushing it near the edge of the table, but she never got the hint. It becomes crowded with just a single appetizer at a two person table when your main dishes arrive. During our most recent, and ultimately final, visit to the Solomon Pond Mall TGIF, people at every other table in this waitress' section, including us, began moving their finished plates to an empty table that hadn't been cleared and cleaned yet from previous customers (who had left before we arrived). With our waitress' slow service, we couldn't get a refill or correct our messed up orders. We ordered second appetizers and it took so long to get them, that we thought she forgot to put the orders in to the kitchen. We finally got our second appetizers after we had paid and put our coats on.
