64,Jason I.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",0,2,,1.0,2012-03-05,"Absolute worst part of the experience at this place are the drinks. No matter what you order, whether a martini or specialty drink, they water it down to the point that there's maybe 1/10th the normal amount of alcohol. Even when you ask the waiter or bartender for the stongest drink on the menu, its a sham. Unbelievably frustrating since every other restaurant I've been to since drinking age will serve a real drink, and this place charges just as much for drinks as any bar but without the alcohol. So if you want to take your kids to get ribs or fried shrimp, you'll be satisfied. But if you want a quality steak or something resembling a drink, don't waste your time here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-marlton?start=60,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.9240000000000002

The combo of this and avocado with onion and veggies was delicious. Paired with fries, it's not a light meal, but what can you do at a place like this? The service was quick and my server was friendly and mentioned my vegetarianism (without me mentioning it). I would come back here again if I was in the mood for this meal or checking out the spinach flat-bread dish.

Thinking nothing of it, I sat down and then a huge drop of water dropped on my head. Turns out, they sat us under a leak. So needless to say, we requested to move tables. Once we did, we were sitting at the new table and literally saw a mouse run across the floor. When we brought this to the attention of out waiter, he said (and I quote), ""Oh, well it's getting cold outside - it's the time of year they come in. Would you like me to move your table and give you a free dessert?"" For the rest of our visit, I was so afraid a mouse would run across my feet and my friend was more concerned about the mouse having been in our food, etc. etc. We shared one appetizer, one drink and one meal.

53,Lena J H.,"Mantua, NJ",91,82,645.0,1.0,2013-02-25,"I was here on Saturday night - no wait and kind of busy, it was after eight PM. I ordered a salad (the chipotle one with avocado) and specifically said no chicken. Someone other than our waitress brought the food out and there was chicken on my salad. The waitress came back, I said I was a vegetarian, and she took the salad to exchange it for another. The salad comes back...and clearly they just tried to remove the chicken from the top of it. It still had pieces of shredded chicken upon inspection, in plain sight!  Then it took forever to get our waitress again, who just took the plate away, without apologizing or offering me something else. Fifteen minutes later, the manager comes over and offers dessert for free. The waitress later comes back and apologizes, blaming the cook. I skipped the entree completely at that point and just got dessert.  It may sound petty to a nonveg, but I found it extremely disrespectful. It is against my morals to eat meat, and they tried to repackage a salad that costs little to make without consideration of me, the customer. Bottom line, would not come here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-marlton?start=40,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.9240000000000002

It was crowded for a weeknight, but before we knew it, there were several tables available. There were other small parties besides my husband and I, and we ended up to be the last to be seated, which I think they did that purposely. That was a thirty minute wait.  My husband has a bad leg, and not putting that into consideration, we were seated in the bar section which had steps. Our waitress was quite rude to us when we needed an extra set of silverware. Our food we ordered didn't reach our table until a half hour later (which by this time the restaurant wasn't crowded)  and our food was below par. TGI Friday's has gone downhill just like so many of the restaurant chains, and this wasn't the only TGI's that has given my husband and I poor service.  Unless TGI Friday's gets their act together in all their restaurants, my husband and I are not coming back!!!!

We received our appetizer and it was luke lukewarm at best. Our waitress suggested a drink and for an 11 dollar drink I expected it to be a tad bit bigger but it was a regular glass size that I could use that 11 dollars to make many drinks at home. My birthday let our waitress know it was my birthday because they used to send over a dessert and sing to a person on their birthday, the waitress informed him they no longer do that, if he wanted them to sing he would have to purchase a dessert and he could pick any he likes.  This is something Fridays used to do and it was a nice gesture on their part and good customer relations, it was a little disappointing they do not do it anymore. For a multi billion dollar company  to be skimping on things like this and raise prices in other categories, they have most certainly changed.

The urine smell that lingered in the ladies room was not the smell I would've chosen to start my meal off. The stickiness of our table was enough to gross out Elmer's glue. Food was just meh.

The beer is always cold and the bartenders,  especially Evan, are very chill. I went a year without coming in but Evan remembered who I was and remembered my name. Doesn't seem like much but if someone can pay attention to detail on something small like a name, you can tell they are going to be solid at what they do. In this case, making a solid drink.

I went last with a small group before a movie at AMC and the appetizer deal was confused and the waitress charged us more - she didn't offer to take her mistake off the bill. Also there was a piece of plastic in my girlfriend's salad which we notified the waitress of but it wasn't a huge deal and she finished it... I thought we'd get some sort of comp. Disappointing.

However, recent times have seen the entire establishment (Corporate, locations, management, and employees) take a nosedive into places that are horrific. The amount of food served has been reduced, in some cases to less then half of what you would have gotten in recent months. All the while, price have been marked up more then 30% on some of the items that have been reduced. The management is lacking in even the most basic of control over their kitchen output, quality of food, and actions/professionalism of their staff. The locations have become dated, dirty and very unkempt. Walking in is almost as if you were walking into a very worn and abused 1980's restaurant that has seen many better days. I wish I could have posted a better review, but recent events in the Cherry Hill, Marlton, and 2 other locations have forced my hand. I would like to return and spend 2 or 3 nights a week enjoying food and friends at these locations, but that is not almost impossible.

Right?  Wrong!  After out experience here, I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS LOCATION.  I visited the ladies restroom which was absolutely atrocious.  Looked, smelled, WAS dirty.  After using the restroom, my appetite was altered somewhat.  Kinda brought me back to my wild college days when you would use the restroom in the club that had the door half torn off with disgusting wet floors.  It reminded me of that! Ordered the food.  First up was french onion soup.  It had these two stale baguette slices with one paper thin slice of cheese on it.  I mean really?  French onion soup crocks are supposed to have a slab of gooey melty cheese over the bowl, not a drizzle of cheese on stale bread.  The broth itself was decent, albeit a bit salty.   My husband's beer was sour.  He never complains about food, but in this instance he felt it necessary to tell the bar tender to TURN OFF THE TAP.  He said that if people drank that beer it would make them sick. My meal was the sizzling chicken and shrimp with cheese or whatever its called.  Usually, this is my FAVORITE MEAL EVER at Fridays.  This concoction they served was a disaster.  The shrimp is supposed to be served over a marinara bruschetta.  They basically took the marinara sauce they use for mozzarella sticks and poured it over the shrimp. NO.  THIS IS NOT HOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE.  I know this from years of patronizing other TGI Fridays and enjoying their delicious chicken and shrimp with cheese dish.  Plus, my chicken tasted like it was microwaved.  It was rubbery and tough and disgusting.  My husband ordered the Jack Daniel's chicken and had the same complaint.  My mashed potatoes tasted like they were made with dehydrated potatoes and not mixed properly.  We brought it to our servers attention how the food was not the best and immediately her whole demeanor changed like we were going to ask for money off the bill or not tip her or something.  But we are not that way (although we could have been) and it is sad to see that response from our server. Considering how terrible the food was, you would expect it to be an off day midweek no?  Well, guess what?  This actually occurred on a Friday when Friday's is supposed to be jumping and busy and they did not bring their A game.  Shame on you Fridays.  If I wasn't so lazy I would report their terrible food to corporate. In sum, I do not recommend this location as their food (and bathrooms) are subpar and make the whole TGI Fridays look bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-marlton,1.4,1.4,1.4,,1.4
