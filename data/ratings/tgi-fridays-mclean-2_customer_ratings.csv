6,Colleen N.,"Des Moines, IA",203,85,1090.0,4.0,2014-01-25,"Located in the corner of Tyson's food court, it's not hard to miss. The menu is the same as any other TGI Friday. I personally always order anything with the jack daniel sauce. SO FINGER LICKING TASTY. There's also lots of seating and a full bar. Definitely stop by if you're tired of shopping.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mclean-2,,,,,

10,Cristine P.,"Sterling, VA",49,125,43.0,5.0,2015-01-08,"Celebrated my brothers 21st birthday here last night. It's a great place to mix both eating and drinking for celebrations such as this. It still has a bat atmosphere to celebrate the whole turning 21 thing, while still allowing everyone to pig out and talk amongst each other. As a regular at the Fairfax location in the past, I was pleased to see that my favorite waitress is now working at this location and waited on us! She kept the drinks coming for my brothers special day and even had some recommendations. We decided on the endless apps for $10 which i personally think is a rip off since I prefer variety and I'm not able to eat enough food for it to be worth $10. Our whole table for the endless apps but none of us ordered a second plate... Now we'll know for next time. The shots were very pricey but the beers were on happy hour so they didn't break my bank. Long story short, I love the atmosphere and the happy hour prices are ones you can't beat! Great place to go for some drinks and greasy bar food with friends for any occasion!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mclean-2,,,,,
7,Trevor W.,"Saline, MI",0,1,1.0,1.0,2015-04-16,Have gone here several times. Usually decent experience. Then a guy named Robert served me. Cold food. Warm drinks. His service was sub par at best.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mclean-2,,,,,
5,Sujata M.,"Arlington, VA",1,12,6.0,1.0,2015-05-06,"It was an empty Wednesday night, all the seats at the bar were full but the tables near the bar were half empty. Like normal human beings we wanted to grab a drink at the bar, the host stopped us and told us there was a wait. With half the restaurant empty... There was a wait at the door to get to the bar. Last time I checked the bar was where you waited and standing room was ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mclean-2,,,,,
8,Rupesh K.,"Fairfax, VA",1,2,,1.0,2015-08-26,"Absolutely horrible service!! Went here for dinner a while back and wanted to write about it. It was Â a very quiet Sunday night and the service was just absurd. The waiter came over to take the order very late, never came back until very late after the dinner was almost done to ask if we needed anything. I let him know my displeasure about not coming to ask us for anything until late and he lied about saying he was attended our table, one thing i will tell you is never argue back, he got defensive rather than apologizing to the point of almost arguing with us, while this was going on one of my family member requested for water and he rudely interrupted and said he heard her and that he was talking to me first.  Talked to the manager and he tells us he has never heard of anyone complaining about this particular waiter Rudy, guess what this waiter was very defensive, argumentative and had an ego...sorry pal I've been to other TGI's and I love TGIs but i have never been treated that way. I understand people might have had bad days but seriously that incident just puts a damp on your ratings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mclean-2,,,,,

1,Jin K.,"Richmond, VA",181,70,225.0,5.0,2016-05-19,"Had a girl's night here and our service, food, and drinks were all on point. Our server recommended me a drink from the bar and it was SO GOOD. Our food came out fairly quick but it was delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mclean-2,,,,,
0,Ron V.,"Fairfax, VA",47,14,,4.0,2016-08-22,"After having a terrible experience at Fridays in Alexandria about a year ago I haven't been to one since. After coming to the mall my girlfriend and I decided to give it another try. The hostess are very quick to greet and make eye contact so that you know it's you they're talking too. Our server was awesome making us feel relaxed and comfortable to enjoy our meal. The jack Daniels burger hit the spot. Just a little pink as I had a requested, many places don't get it right but they did. If I ever crave another jack Daniels burger this is the Fridays I will be choosing without a doubt. The only complaint I have was not having silverware, but our server fixed that quickly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mclean-2,,,,,
2,Paulina L.,"Herndon, VA",65,20,2.0,3.0,2017-07-15,"Only got 3 milkshakes but the staff was super friendly. Only gave 3 stars because I watched one of, what I assume to be a server in a red shirt, stick his fingers in the strawberries container behind the bar and stick them in his mouth. Which grossed me out. This locations is open.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mclean-2,,,,,
