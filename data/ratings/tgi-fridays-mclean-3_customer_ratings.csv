To be fair, this location is quite nice - much nicer than any other Friday's I've ever been to.  There's about 50 or so seats up at the bar and plenty of tables.  It wasn't people in their work clothes who were visiting here; it was people who were only here to watch a soccer game.

We sat at the bar on a Sunday night (tonight) and the place was packed. The energy in TGI is upbeat and there are a lot of TV's going on at once.  The bar maid told us about the food and my wife ordered a French Onion soup which was really delicious. Very well done and cheesy. I ordered the tomato soup, which was also very tasty, hot and filling. We ordered the mediterranean with steak and they took a while (too long) to bring us the appetizer size, we ordered the meal. So they re-ordered it and that took a while too, maybe 20 minutes.  When we got the first wrong dish we had a few bites before we realized it was not what we wanted. After we told the bar maid we asked another if we should eat this or if she was going to take it away. Seamed a waste to dump it, but she did, just chucked it in the trash or we could pay for both.  Another bar maid said that the manger insisted on taking both food items off of our check, very nice of them. We enjoyed the med (beef) in the theater very much.

I have been there before and it was ok, though Friday's in other countries is better. This time being in America we thought the service would be even better but were very shocked. Our waitress took our orders and brought the wings pretty fast but then disappeared. I had to call someone else to get two empty plates because we were sharing the platter, the guy brings them and they are disgustingly dirty, with old food stuck on them. I had to get up and look for someone to bring other plates, they were not even apologetic about it. Then came the main course after 30 minutes of waiting, the waitress had clearly forgotten about us, and it was wrong. When I brought it up she was rude and arrogant and looked like she was going to slap me. She then got the drinks wrong and took another 20 minutes. They didn't even bother to bring forks and knives for which I had to get up myself. It's such a horrible feeling when they just dump the food and things on the table with no care in the world. Last I heard this was a restaurant not a cafeteria in prison. The worst part was when we asked for the check, of course she took for ever but then brought back wrong change twice, trying to cheat us on $3 as if we were not going to notice or we couldn't count. Very bad waitress and trying to steal on top of it? We were very disappointed and will never go back. This was at Tyson's Corner mall in Virginia.

Carlos, finally arrived on the scene but he also does not know the prices except for one, ""the most expensive cocktail is $10"", helpful? Not.  -The house salad is described as having red cabbage and arriving with a hot garlic breadstick. Neither made an appearance. We politely noted this to Carlos so he would not get dinged for the kitchen's mistakes but he seemed somewhat gormless at this stage. The half rack of ribs were delicious, fell off the bone and nice touch to have the sauce on the side to cater for different tastes. We did wait 45 mins for the food to arrive though, FYI.

Our theory is that all the 4-5 stars reviews on here is based on their busy days Friday, Saturday, possibly Sunday? And the people with bad experience are the ones coming in early weekdays. When my boyfriend went with his friends on a Friday his steak was great, service was good and overall was pleased when he got home. We went together with a friend a month later on a Monday and didn't feel the same way.  Our waitress was a little off, when she ID me she said Happy Birthday after seeing my birth date but my birthday was a couple months ago. I even double checked my ID because I thought maybe I somehow took someone else. Afterwards she disappeared and didn't show up until after we got a food, which took about 35 minutes to get there. When our food did get there the steak wan't medium rare but well done. It was also extremely thin, not at all like the one my boyfriend ordered a month back, and the sides were warm/ near cool. My friends dish and mine were similar, lukewarm and lacking of something. Our friend didn't have any utensil because the waitress only gave us 2. We did try to flag her down but she was no where to be found so we just stole one from an empty table near us. The table behind us seemed frustrated with our waitress too and left in a hurry.

However, we did decide to give it a try one last time to grab drinks and appetizers and boy was the third time a charm! Instead of sitting in the dining area like we had previously, we sat at a table in the bar area and were immediately greeted. Our server was Patrick and he was phenomenal.  He helped suggest drinks and what appetizers would match which drinks. He also made sure we had enough sauces and all of our special modifications were brought out perfectly. Even though the restaurant was very slow, instead of just standing around, Patrick was very engaging with us. And once we had a couple other tables, he still treated us exactly the same as he had when we were his only table. Absolutely some of the best service we have received in awhile. We definitely plan on being back (at least to the bar area). We wish there were more servers like Patrick everywhere! It's amazing how much of a difference an engaging server makes in a dining experience. ""Our server did not speak English, I was brought a pasta with no sauce and the manager even stated that it came without sauce, although the menu explicitly described the sauce. Then the manager was very unprofessional and blamed it on other employees instead of simply resolving the issue. He also took my plate before giving me a chance to voice my issue.  Took 10 minutes for us to be greeted after we were seated, 20 minutes for our food (pasta and chicken tenders), and another 10 minutes for someone to return to our table while my naked pasta sat there. Another 20 minutes to recook a pasta.  Worst dining experience I've ever had. It was not all the server's fault; I place more of the blame on the Manager, KC Wang, for not being professional. It was very clear to us (fellow servers and managers) that this restaurant has terrible service and dining experience because it is led by an unprofessional manager.  Furthermore, this was not the first time we had tried eating here. The first time we sat for 15 minutes before being greeted by our server and when she finally arrived we got up and left because we waited so long and she rolled her eyes to us, saying ""fine whatever snots"".

But the reason I'm giving a 2 stars review is because of those salads... They were awful to say the least... Honestly how can you get a salad wrong when even Wendy's' taste better? First the chicken in the pecan chicken salad will haunt my dreams forever. It was one of the worst things I have EVER tasted, it had a horrible taste, like expired horrible... The crust had a foul smell like rancid oil, and it was almost raw... You can tell it was from a bag and they just heated it up for a few minutes... I don't understand how this is possible when the food took forever to arrive?! The chicken inside, if you can call that chicken... Was mushy and it just makes me sick thinking about it, I just pray to God that I'm soon able to forget about it.  I thought I would just ask for another chicken but my mom also asked for the same and her chicken was exactly like this as well, BAD! to the point where chicken nuggets are a gourmet delicacy compared to that... The lettuce was old with more black spots than a Dalmatian, and even though the waitress would asked us of the food was alright, she wouldn't even stick around long enough for us to tell her and didn't even get the hint even after we took all the breading off from the chicken and left it on the side of the plate. This was honestly a really unsatisfying and bad experience. I remember when a was a kid, they had to give me this orange flavored medicine and the flavor was so bad, I hated oranges until I was an adult. I just hope the same doesn't happen now with pecans because of this sad excuse of ""pecan chicken"" salad.

Each time you order, the bartender gives you a receipt of what you received. I checked my tab before ordering another drink with a a blonde girl. When I finished I got my check. I guess this is where I was at fault? Since I had seen my check before and only ordered one more drink, I didn't feel the need to look at my receipt again. Unbeknownst to my knowledge someone at Friday's decided to combine my check with the guy next to me??? She came back saying she could only charge a certain amount on my card and I owed her 11.00.

The reason I am writing this review is for you to be aware of an occurrence that took place with me on Saturday, January 30, 2015 in the evening.   My wife, son, and daughter went out to Tyson's to get a bite to eat ending up at Fridays.  Our WAITRESS (I forgot her name) took our order and served us...her service wasn't that bad.    After we finished, we grabbed the check and I provided her with my debit bank card with the visa logo.  She went to the back to charge the food and returned with the receipt.  As usual, I gave a 20% tip and went home.   On a normal Monday, I checked my financial accounts because that is what I always do.  This Monday was different; I had to find a total of $2,224 was spent at the local Best Buy and H.H. Greg.  This is very concerning because I only used my card at Fridays and at no other location that entire weekend!  Plus, I haven't been to Fairfax's Best Buy in years and never been to H.H. Greg. When working with the bank and the local authority, I looked at my Fridays receipt and noticed that the name of the waitress was not on it however a man's name (will not disclose to the public) handled the transaction in the back out of my sight.  Although the banks and police are handling the situation, I wanted you to be aware of this possibility.  I did speak with the manager at Fridays to make her aware of the possibility however there wasn't much concern from them. I am not saying that Fridays was the culprit but I do know that 1. The card was never used at any other location that weekend, 2. This was the only time I was in the Tyson's area that weekend, 3. I am not sure if it is standard practice however a female waitress served me and a male finalized my receipt, and 4. That was the only time the card was out of my possession.

After trekking all the way out to Tysons for dinner and movie night, gift card in hand for a particular eatery only found at Tysons, we arrived sans reservations around 6:30 and were told they ""were fully committed to reservations and could not accommodate walk in guests"" that evening. The place was empty at this time but whatever. We called 3-4 other restaurants in the mall and were more or less told the same thing.

First +1 was the actual wait was only 10 minutes. Second +1 was all day Saturday happy hour. Yes, you won't find anything beyond a mediocre beer on special but $4 for a Stella was fine by me especially after braving the absolutely ridiculous gobs of people who came from who knows where flooding the mall that day (but that's for another review...) I ordered the sizzling chicken and spinach (chicken on a bed of spinach with mushrooms, onions, and yellow squash) paired with a tomato and mozzarella salad. When the dish was brought out our server poured a miso glaze over the chicken for the ""sizzling"" effect. This dish was, and I'm still in shock myself, pretty tasty coming from a place more well known for its fried foods and wings. It was flavorful, due to the miso glaze, portion size was quite filling, and the tomato mozzarella salad was equal tomato to mozzarella ratio. My partner ordered a build your own burger with pepper jack, chipotle mayo, bacon, and fries. He was a happy camper. The real star of this experience, and why I'm awarding the extra star to what would have been a 3 star review, was our server, Ebenezer. I can truly say he provided one of the best service experiences I have had in quite some time.

I remember when T.G.I.F.'s were a weekly event for my group of friends.. so tonight we hit the town with nostalgia and ended up with stomachs half empty/half regretful.   Our waiter started off nice.. but slowly we started to realize something was amiss...  Start:  -he didn't place a partial order of ours, eventually placing our whole order..  -disappearing.. -appetizer arrived before our drinks  - utensils arrived after asking for them... upon getting drinks after appetizers  -waiter didn't take away the menus after we ordered  -plates and menus remained on table and after asking for removal.. only the menu's were removed.. -plates were removed upon arrival of main course. Food: -Spinach dip = very good -peach sangria = strong, but delicious..  way too much ice. 4-5 large sips and no more drink.. -had to ask for water during main course..  waiter never brought any over nor offered upon seeing empty glasses for 20min.. -Jack Daniel's ribeye - medium rare = cooked properly in color.. horrible cut of steak. Extremely tough,  way too salty.  Seasoned fries were the best part of the meal.. mozzarella and tomatoes side.. contained about 4-5 small pieces of mozzarella, more tomatoes and lots of onions.. not a good side Maybe I've just been spoiled with having higher quality steaks lately.. but for a $20 steak.. I was disheartened to spit out about 3 pieces then stop half way.. realizing it wasn't edible for me..  Ah, and call me old fashioned..  but I didn't really appreciate the lack of a paper check.. our waiter was using a tablet.. but after asking for the check.. he just announced the price to the two of us.. and stood there awkwardly asking for payment. I get the convince factor.. but if I bring someone out on a date (thankfully this wasn't one) I'm surely going to stay far away from the new T.G.I.F..  Kicker - a table of teen girls next to us were sitting alone and a table of two lonely guys in their twenties were at the table next to them.. we got the pleasure of watching him fail miserably with a series of pickup lines.. then regress after learning they were underaged.. talk about an awkward moment.. then having to sit back down... adjacent to them..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mclean-3?start=20,2.32,2.7,2.7,1.9600000000000002,2.548

72,Aaron C.,"McLean, VA",1,36,55.0,2.0,2016-03-12,"Decent food but the service is very hit or miss. Let me just tackle both of these items separately: Food is decent, some of it is pretty solid 4 star quality but other choices are pretty meh. For example their key West shrimp and Jack Daniels burger are pretty top notch and flavorful, but their mozzarella sticks can be a little bland sometimes and the fried green beans can taste a little odd (like a watery, greasy green bean flavor, bleh...). Most of the food is still pretty good and if you come here during endless apps with friends its easy to get a cheap meal of 12 bucks a person for all the pit stickers and boneless BBQ wings you can eat! (Or just do the 10 dollars for an endless ap, its very easy to save money during endless aps if you calculate your math right!) The service is...honestly I've had more bad experiences than good. I've gone to the front to be brought to a table and the lady was texting in her phone for 5 minutes until I cleared my throat and she finally realized my party was right in front of her. I've had servers disappear on me to the point where I had to literally get up and look for them. I've had a waitress bring me the wrong check TWICE and even then wrongfully charge me for things I didn't order. I've had a virgin strawberry daiquiri brought to me and it was mixed in the strangest way (the daiquiri mix was on the bottom half of the drink and the ice was in the top half, how do you even do that...?)! Whether the place is busy or packed, there's only about a 1/3 to 50/50 chance your service won't have some form of trouble or another. Every time I have been there I noticed that the staff tend to flock where the food is served, and when I sat right next to that area I discovered that all they really do is gossip around random stuff. Just my two cents, but if you can sit at the bar or get a good server, the food is worth a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mclean-3?start=60,2.28,2.71,2.71,1.9280000000000002,2.5380000000000003

I walked up to the hostess table and I know she saw me but she blatantly ignored me for a couple minutes until I first spoke up and asked ""excuse me can I get a table?""  If this didn't already put us in an annoyed mood, it was our waitress who made our experience even worse. She was in her early 20s and since we were the same age group as her, I guess she thought she could treat us as if we're close friends. One of the friends I've ate with is an experienced server and we couldn't help but notice her every mistake. When taking our orders she leaned on our table with her elbows and hands touching our table with her butt sticking out. ??? We aren't your friends visiting you while you're working so please don't do that it's just so unprofessional and comes off as being rude. Also we were getting the 12$ deal (main entree and cocktail) and when we were showing her our ID, one of us had a NY license (the bendable kind) and she goes on to say rude things like 'oh is this even real? I mean I don't really care if it's fake or real I just check it because I have to' okay first of all, it's real and it's real rude to be saying those things to your customer. If you suspect that it's fake, ask for another ID or just go and scan it. After all that, I had to keep asking her if she got the right order because at this point I wouldn't be surprised if she messed something up. And after our entrees came out, she only came by once.. Honestly for such a big chain like TGI Fridays we shouldn't be in that situation with an inexperienced, unprofessional waitress. Our food was mediocre like my truffle burger was way too salty. For the price i paid yesterday I might give it another try... but honestly the service has got to change.

My boyfriend and I went on a Monday night, it wasn't that busy, my bf got the endless apps. The part that sucked was that they forgot to put an order in. He waited about 30+ mins for loaded potatoe skins, he was so unhappy that he didn't even finish it. Then when the check came I asked the bartender if I could use a coupon I had bc I'm a Fridays  reward thing. She said no bc it would counteract the endless apps and we would have to pay for the apps we got??? So that ticked me off.

44,Alexander M.,"Las Vegas, NV",405,1023,2308.0,2.0,2016-12-07,"TGI Fridays just doesn't do it for me anymore. I really feel like the chain itself has just gotten worse every time I decide to try them again. This past experience will most likely be the last. This location is inside the Tysons Corner Center Mall. Food Court/Right next to the AMC Theatre's. The reason I felt like being so descriptive for the readers is because the staff mislead me the day I called to ask where they were located specifically. It was like being on a wild-goose hunt for this place. I was upset prior to arriving because a woman with a thick accent answered the phone and told me the wrong information about where they were located.. Seriously how can you not properly guide somebody to the place that you work at for hours a day? I'll digress... We arrived around 11:45 PM and they closed at 1:00 AM. The staff standing upfront were obviously not interested in seating any more guest. We watched as the young African American boy and the lady with the thick accent debated about who wanted to seat us. Weird. I think she knew I was the one who she gave incorrect directions to and was too embarrassed to host us. Whatever. We sat and waited for another probably 10-15 minutes for a server to come by. Annoyed and ready to go my friends calmed the situation and ordered us a round of drinks. Don't let TGI Friday's fool you with this all day everyday Happy Hour BS, Yes they offer it however the drinks are a joke! Kool-Aid much? Wasn't worth it at all. My drink I basically gulped down in seconds because it was juice. I get it that it's Happy Hour but if you want to be that stingy with the alcohol because the special you're better off not offering it at all. My entrée was below par and it was apparent that it wasn't fresh. The sampler in the picture looked way more appetizing. My dish looked like my little nephew threw a bunch of things on a plate and heated it up in the microwave. My potato skins had two specks of cheese on them and they were dried out. To add insult to injury one of my friends also ordered this and hers came out just like the picture? Why? How? Did they not come from the same kitchen? I was over it.

Party festival overall. Anything deep fried is fine (traditional American fast-food'ish fare; pub fare).  We arrived when the restaurant was quite empty, and there are booths available (crescent shaped, comfy sofa around it on 3 sides of the table). One waiter let us sit there. But another came and said since we are a party of 2, their policy is to give that booth seat to a larger group (even though there are no larger groups waiting). We were moved to a high table (with high stools). But were moved to the booth again by another (well-intending) waiter. But we got moved back to the high table again later! Mystery!

We were about to leave when we were greeted and got our beer orders. She put the order in as we ordered so we did not expect it to take 15 min for delivery. We again were about to leave and got out drinks. Sure enough the beer tasted like it was poured right when we ordered and sat out. The food was the only thing that somewhat redeemed itself but we never got silverware until the food came and we never got plates for our apps. Our server never actually came by to check on us when we got the food.

There was a stack of dirty plates still on the table so the host got someone to clear them then told us to sit down. We asked him if they were going to clean the table, but he stated that the table was already cleaned, there just happened to be some dirty dishes on top. How does that even make sense? We said there were still some food scraps both on the table and seats, but he just said something in Spanish to his manager and walked away.

I know I can always fall back on the BEST appetizer they're known for, potato skins! This time though they came out not looking like the usual scooped out halves of potatoes smothered with mounds of cheese, bacon, scallions and a side of sour cream. WHY!? Why would anyone change this must have and LOVED item from their menu? Instead it looked like slices of cheese semi-melted on fried quartered potato wedges with uneven dusting of over cooked bacon and tub of sour cream topped with few scallions. Neither sounds appetizing nor tasted appetizing and same goes for my friend's burger and fries.  Atmosphere was nice being able to watch playoffs comfortably in middle of crowded mall. Only reason for giving a star for this visit. Can't comment on drinks but some all day deals looked appealing. Service was ""mehhh.""

24,Richard C.,"Springfield, VA",2650,533,6415.0,5.0,2017-02-06,"Another one where I am surprised with the rating. But I get it low ratings on Yelp work to make businesses improve and I think that's what has happened here. Because our dinning experience here was fantastic, top notch. Mostly due to the great waiter we had Ebenezer. He did a great job. He truly knows the importance of customer service and the next time we come to the TGI Friday's at Tyson's Corner Center we will surely request Ebenezer.  Great location directly across from the movie theatre and right next to a parking garage entrance. Access is very easy. So you can shop all day, have lunch or dinner here, then go see a movie. How great is that? So we meet a couple friends here, my wife and I arrive first and the place was pretty crowded. Our waiter greeted us right away and we ordered wings and drinks, me a beer of course and my wife a Frozen Lava Flow. The beer nice and cold the wings juicy and packed with flavor. Before our friends arrive our waiter checked in us a few times which we like. So our friends come order drinks and we order meals. My wife told the waiter the Lave Flow wasn't sweet as other TGI Friday's and the next drink came back perfect. They want to make sure you get exactly what you want. Our food came out quickly, I ordered a ribeye with shrimp that was cooked just as requested. Nice and juicy, not fat just good old delicious BEEF. The batter on the shrimp was tasty and crisp and the shrimp big and and tasty as well. My wife and friend ordered burgers and fries and both of them also enjoyed their meals or other friend had a shrimp dish which was also very good.  On this night customer service has really great. We were constantly check on, table cleared as soon as we finish a plate and beer never ran dry. We also had a couple other wait staff check on us. These people really wanted to make sure we fully enjoy our time here and we all absolutely did.  How good is it to be fortunate enough to enjoy time with the love of your life, friends, great conversation, tv's everywhere so during nice conversations you can peek at a Capitals game, a near perfect waiter and great tasting food. That's a combination that's just doesn't occur that often.  Also, make sure you join the TGI Friday's rewards program, I believe it's one of the best. Always sending us buy one entree get one free, free deserts and free appetizers. Nice. We have found a new favorite TGI Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mclean-3,2.84,2.55,2.55,2.516,2.6659999999999995

Server was great and everything was going well, ordered my food and all. Anyway, had 2 other friends join us, and one of them had to go to the bathroom as soon as he got in, so I had to order for him while he was gone. When the food runner or whoever it was who brought my food came to us (mid height Hispanic chick, little thick with weight) brought my food, I said ""hey so my friend just got here and...""...I put those dots because as soon as I said that she cut me off and barked at me with ""I just brought your food you have to put orders with your server."" I stood there shocked for a second.  Not just that, but it was in the most disrespectful and attitude-filled voice, topped with a head tilt and facial expression of ""f*** off"". Jesus Christ, the disrespect she threw at me is one that you have to actually try hard to do. 10 mins later, she almost ran a 10 year old kid over and didn't even look back to check, the kid looked at her shocked. I will never return to this place because of this possible racist but most definitely disrespectful person, and believe me I'm telling my friends not to either. This person needs to get fired.

We got the endless appetizers which would be better named the endless wait. 25-30 min wait for our first round of appetizers. We immediately ordered the 2nd round when the first round arrived and still had to wait 22 min (we decided to keep track that time) for the second round. Because we complained about the extremely long wait they let us order a third round about 15 min after we ordered the second round (note this was before the second round had even arrived), so it wasn't quite as long of a wait. By the third round we were so sick of waiting around that we didn't order more. The food arrived cold or over cooked. The rounds after the first round get smaller so we literally waited the 22 min to get a plate that had 4 small cold meatballs on it. Thanks for nothing. The potato skins that came with our third round were so over cooked it was almost comical how bad they were. I wish I had taken a photo because they were so bad. They were burnt with only remnants of over cooked solidified cheese. We didn't even bother asking them to redo them because by that time we just wanted to leave.  When the manager was walking around to tables and asked how it was, we let her know we were disappointed with the waits. She indicated that was normal for this special. I wish the had warned us because we would have ordered off the regular menu because we had a toddler with us. She gave us an unsigned coupon for a free appetizer on another visit, but since it isn't signed I doubt it would be accepted.

I've also never had a problem with the service at all, even when I'm super grumpy after dealing with the insane crowds at the mall. It seems like Fridays has been shifting their menu to a much more snack-themed, burger-centric, and drink-heavy menu instead of a dinner menu. I'm totally fine with that because the appetizers and drinks are pretty extensive, but that might be a dealbreaker for some. I highly recommend the pretzel with beer/bacon cheese appetizer here.

5,Jordan P.,"Grand Rapids, MI",0,10,,1.0,2017-06-26,"My friend and I went there for endless appetizers on a Sunday Night. It was not too busy and we were seated promptly, so that was nice. Sadly, that was where the positives started coming to an end.  Our waiter's name was Abenzir, and right from the outset he seemed very eager to get rid of us. I was trying to order a drink off the happy hour menu, and spent roughly 2 seconds looking before he said ""I will just get you water and come back later."" He came back with the waters and took our orders for the drinks and endless apps at the same time. This was the last time we saw him for quite some time.  He brought out my drink almost 10 minutes after ordering, even though he clearly was not doing much else. Another server ended up bringing out our food and he did not come back to check on us when it was brought out. He did manage to walk by, grab my friend's partially full water glass off the table and walk away without making eye contact or saying a word. He returned, dropping off the water glass also without saying a word.  When he did come by, he would rarely stop at the table for any period of time. He shouted while walking by ""want another Long Island"" and yelled ""got it"" over his shoulder as I said yes. This second order for a Long Island was """"placed"""" before we ordered our second round of appetizers and did not come out until after we received our third order.  Throughout the experience, other staff brought out our food and he never bothered checking on us, nor did he take our empty appetizer plate. When he eventually took our orders for more food, he did so by showing up and going ""quick, order 2 more"" as if we were on some kind of time crunch. One time he did bring the food out himself, but he put it on our table without looking at us, while talking to the table next to us.  Abenzir was quite rude and gave off a vibe that we were severely inconveniencing him by being in the restaurant. I understand that endless appetizer customers probably aren't the most lucrative, but we were also ordering drinks, and he was rude and abrupt from the moment we sat down. The few times he did actually speak to us, he called each us ""bud"" or ""buddy"" about 2 times per interaction. I always find that to be an incredibly condescending term, that a Dad might use with their 8 year old son, not one a crappy server should use on paying customers that are about the same age as him.  This whole review was mostly about Abenzir, and it is possible that I would have given a better review if he was not such a bad waiter. Unfortunately, he really soiled the experience, and there was not many other positives. The drinks were kind of watered down, and the endless appetizers did not taste good at all. I think the prices were decent and the atmosphere was okay, but even if I got a really good waiter and ordered something off the main menu, I don't think this place would ever exceed 3 stars.  PS: They do a BS tip calculation thing if you order endless apps. On the bill, they list the prices of all the food you order, then subtract all the food you order and list ""discount."" Then when they put the recommended tip, they tally up all the regular priced food, and the $12 cost for endless appetizers, and calculate the recommended tip on that combined price (post tax as well).  So as an example, if you technically got $20 worth of food for the $12 endless app price, they suggest you leave a tip on $32 (total of food plus the $12 endless app price) and then also factor in the tax, so you are suggested to leave $6.60 as a tip for the $12 endless apps. Even with a good waiter, I would not have done this, because the logic makes no sense, but with a crappy waiter like Abenzir, I absolutely did not do this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mclean-3?start=20,2.56,2.51,2.51,,2.5300000000000002
28,Katherine S.,"Richmond, VA",280,117,331.0,2.0,2017-06-28,"TL;DR: food was good; service was absolutely terrible The only thing that redeems Fridays ever is their endless appetizer special. Also, this Fridays gets a lot of business soley based off the fact that they're in the busiest part of the mall.  Food: 4/5 if you know what to expect here, then you know it won't be anything special. But everything came out rather quickly, hot, and as expected.  Service: 1/5 Our waitress was pretty terrible. We got seated immediately (it wasn't that busy) and after a few minutes she came and greeted us. It took her another 4 minutes to drop off our waters. We decided to get our orders in quickly before she took off again. After we placed our orders, we did not see our waitress for a while. All our waters/drinks/cocktails were EMPTY. A runner came about 10 minutes later with our food.  A couple minutes after that she came to ask us how everything was. We said it was good, and before we could ask her anything else she started to walk away. I had to wave her down again to ask for drink refills and to put in another order of food. Each time we put in a new order (about 4 times) she was no where to be found in between. Occasionally, she would come in from the main entrance, so I assume she went on some type of break? Once we were finally finished eating, we looked around for our waitress. 10 minutes later we saw her walk in, and then she just wandered around to other tables. FINALLY we were able to wave her down (again) and ask for our checks.  I get that people who get the endless apps can be annoying to serve. It's cheap so most people probably don't tip much. But some people (like me) tip more than 20% for things like this because I feel bad. That doesn't mean your service should go down that terribly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mclean-3,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

175,Christina V.,"King George, VA",0,4,5.0,1.0,2017-08-06,"This has to be the most interesting visit to TGI Fridays ever. So the first thing that happen was we got a tall beer and on that glass was a lip stick print. That was literally disgusting. I thought they are suppose to check the dishes before they use instead of being lazy and skimming them as they come out. The second thing was we got 3 endless appetizers and I got the Jack Daniel's chicken sandwich. So the first course came out and everything was warm. We thought.. Ok that person waited till all of them were done to serve them EVEN after I said go ahead and bring them out whenever they are done. But we said whatever. The second round came and yet again it was still warm. I'm saying to myself how long does it take to deliver food when its done and its not like they are busy or anything because its definitely not busy. I ended up going to the manager and all he did was take 50% off my meal instead of the whole ticket. It wasnt just my meal that was warm. But guess what happend after I talked to the manager... The 3rd round came out hot. Just because I complained to the manager about how poor the service was the correct way happend. Thats not how it works. It tasted like the food was sitting for a while. The correct way should be a consistent way. Oh did I mention we had 4 waiters. The waiters didn't come up and check up on us or anything they just brought us our food, picked up plates and left. Now I have been to the TGI Friday's in Fredericksburg Va and they are fantastic. The food and service is outstanding. Never a disappointment there. But here, I will never come here again. It was very disappointing. If you decide to go I hope you have a way better experience then what we had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mclean-3?start=80,2.28,2.49,2.49,,2.406

Friday's location with a party of 3 tonight while the restaurant was quite busy at 7pm, and have received phenomenal service. Our waitress was Lina.  Normally, I go to the World Gate T.G.I. Friday's location and hands down, every single time I go, there is an average of 4-7 tables total, and I receive horrible service. To see Tyson's so packed, and our server serving like 5, 6 or more tables was flat out  impressive with the service she gave us. May I mention, the quality of food at this Tyson's location is greatly distinct from the World Gate location. Examples being the potato skins and chicken quesadillas tasting much better.  All in all, Lina was the best server at T.G.I. Friday's I and my friends have EVER had. Thank you Lina for giving my friends and I a great experience, we look forward to coming back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mclean-3,2.44,2.47,2.47,,2.458
36,Drew H.,"Burke, VA",8,74,27.0,2.0,2017-09-02,"Fun fact: This is a corporate location. Not so fun fact: This means prices are more expensive for nearly the exact same menu. For example in SPringfield Fridays, the endless appetizers are $10 but at TC its $12. $2 more because its corporate. And yes, one more not so fun fact: each serving of flatbread contained less and less toppings. i had 6 plates of flatbread appetizers, meaning i had 3 orders of 2 plates each time. Now i didnt take photos so you will just have to take my word for it. But, i pinky swear it. it went from 2/3 full of tomatoes/onions to less than 2/3 closer to 1/2 then final pairing barely enough to fill ONE pita square from 3 pita squares. Obviously they assumed that i would throw away my food. and obviously the cooks didn't see my empty plates each time. i mean they were squeaky clean of food!  You know what assumed means???? it means it makes an a@@ out of U and Me. Now in this case i wasnt being an a@@ and technically they were not either. but still its fun to insert this wisdom. Anyways, another comment is that the consistency of how dried out the flatbread was varied with each plate. I mean i had 6 different levels from nicely warmed (my fav) to pita chips with salsa on top. Talk about variance! In comparision, the Springfield Fridays had better consistency and every time i got FULL flatbreads with same topppings for a HUGE savings of $2. Mo' food for Less Dough??? Sign me up Scotty!! Now to conclude with yes, another no so fun fact: the patrosn of this establishment nationwide took advantage of their endless appetizers and promptly wasted lots of food. At least that is their reasoning for making each platter of endless appetizer about 1/3 smaller. The same flatbread from 2 weeks ago now is easily 1 pita square smaller. but its still endless!  But, c'mon Murica! Eat All Your Endless Appetizers Like A Woman or Man!!!! I did even though i was stuffed after the 2nd round.

Every time we've been here, the service and food has been great and never disappoint. This particular location had been revamped not so long ago, where they upgraded their interior and POS systems, making the ordering process a lot quicker, which is neat! I like the dim lighting, it allows guests to feel like they're more relaxed and not rushed. The feel of the restaurant is like a sports bar with large T.V.'s all around the bar area and the high table seating.   I love love loveee that they change up their drink specials from time to time, and especially in the Summer when they have those Tiki glasses! I really enjoy their Double Berry Mojito, and my boyfriend enjoys their Ultimate Long Island. I also really like their sangrias too! They have everything, so whenever you're feeling a beer, or doing some shots, they got you. Their corona buckets are a great deal, I would definitely recommend if you're with a group. As for food, think their endless apps are a pretty good deal, especially if you like boneless wings! They also potato skins, mozzarella sticks, bbq chicken flatbread, and etc. The variety is great. My least favorite though was the potstickers. Their Jack Daniels anything is the freaking bomb! Their burgers are fantastic, my favorite is the Buffalo Wingman's Burger.  Fridays is the perfect place to stop by after a late-ending shift, because their last call is up to 1AM.  It's also a great place to chill at the bar, meet some friends, or grab a bite and watch the game.  The customer service is always wonderful. The managers, hosts, bar staff, and servers make a great team. They are attentive and accommodating, always making sure that the guest comes first. If you have any questions about the menu, just ask, most of the  servers have a great knowledge of the menu. They are open to substitutions and will make sure to take care of any allergies you have. If you decide to stop by, ask for Heidi, Bree, or Abenezer, they are excellent servers, who will take great care of you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mclean-3,2.48,2.41,2.41,,2.438

We finally placed an order for drinks and when those came out we placed an order of the brussel spouts app and sliders. Closing in on the time we needed to be getting to the theater, the food finally came out.  What a hairy situation to be in. The brussel sprouts arrived with a long piece of HAIR on them. Dammit! They quickly exchanged them for a fresh order... and sort of apologized. The sliders tasted good. The drinks and service were marginal, followed by a miscommunication in billing. Rough!

My ribs were dry and the meat on top was dry and over cooked. There was more fat then meat and the small bit of meat that you did get was actually pretty tender.
