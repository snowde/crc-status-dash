There wasn't much to go wrong since I chose an appetizer for lunch and a soda.

1,Megan W.,"New Cumberland, PA",0,1,,3.0,2014-06-11,Food = excellent Drink prices = INSANE I've never paid more than $8.50 for sangria ever in my life. They charge $11.50 here. There may be 3 kinds of alcohol but there are also 5-6 nonalcoholic ingredients.  And the size of the drink is not measurable to any drink you'd pay $11.50 for.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2?start=20,3.1480000000000006,3.1480000000000006,3.1480000000000006,3.1480000000000006,3.1480000000000006

2,Lauren K.,"Carlisle, PA",2,20,8.0,5.0,2014-10-05,"We ate there today at 2pm (restaurant downtime) and had a party of 20 with 12 adults and 8 children. All of the adults had the unlimited appetizers, and Laura was a phenomenal waitress! Every single drink was filled multiple times, we all ate tons of appetizers, and overall had an awesome experience. The general manager Russel introduced himself before the entire party arrived and was genuinely warm and personable. He even helped deliver some of our food! Great job to the kitchen keeping up with all of us...we made an incredible memory today! Brava!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2?start=20,,,,,
32,John G.,"Camp Hill, PA",80,246,109.0,3.0,2014-10-09,Are here with a group of about 20 people. We were set up as a party we had a couple of servers.  Had The chicken on Spinach great tasting dish enjoyed it. Seen a few of the other dish come out and everyone said their meals were good got to sample some Ahi tuna that was an appetizer got to say that it was enjoyable. Had a glass of Pinot Grigio seemed a bit expensive for the quality and quantity of the serving. Servers were slow and not as attentive for a group that was under reservations. Overall I enjoyed the evening but TGIFridays definitely has to improve on their servers even though their meals are really good! If the service was better probably would have rated a 4 star!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2,,,,,
3,Kay F.,"Harrisburg, PA",4,33,,5.0,2014-12-16,"WE love this TGI FRIDAYS  (we live in North Harrisburg & the Union Deposit one is disgusting! & Never honored our Stripes!)  We sit at the bar & they have the same  ""GREAT""  bartenders with fantastic service!

30,Anjali A.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",44,209,498.0,3.0,2015-03-02,"Excellent drink options. We ordered spicy margarita. It really was spicy, not only in name. We went little late on Saturday. The place was nor crowded, neither empty. Fast, no nonsense service. Entrée  was delicious - shrimp and chicken Alfredo pasta. Appetizer was just ok - Nachos. Ordered 3 desserts. Peanut butter pie - my niece loved it. Brownie - ok. Whiskey cake - good.  I would have given 4 stars, but took away 1 star because: 1) they gave us spoons with pasta. Where in the world do people eat pasta with spoons? 2) napkins and appetizer plates were brought to the table when we were nearly finished eating nachos.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2,,,,,

4,Kimberly S.,"Dover, PA",65,12,,1.0,2015-08-02,"After sitting down our server came over fairly quickly to get our drink order, but that was about the only thing she got right. We sat without drinks for almost 15 minutes. Meanwhile our margarita's were finished and sitting at the bar. The manager stopped to make sure we'd been taken care of, I replied that we had but had been waiting a long time for our drinks. He said he thought they were ready, but he would go check. Instead of bringing them to us, he had our server do it which took even more time. After she came over with the drinks I tried to order an appetizer and she walked away from the table mid order!!! I had to flag her down to place the order. While ordering our food it became apparent she had little to no menu knowledge even though she said she'd worked there for a year. My friend requested a sauce used in another menu item and the girl said they didn't have it, but they really do. When the food arrived my friends salad was missing avocado. When asked for it the server replied that salad doesn't come with avocado but I can get it for you at an extra charge. The menu clearly stated the salad had avocado. At this point our table was not cleared of empty plates and glasses causing us to feel cramped, so we stacked them and put them to the edge of the table. They still sat there every time she walked past. Her attitude was horrible and it was obvious she didn't care we weren't happy. Not a good experience at all! Only positive of this visit was  the bartenders participating in bar champs. Ricky (sp?) noticed my drink wasn't properly made and even though I told her it was fine, fixed it because that's what you're supposed to do! The guest should be the top priority, and within reason do whatever it takes to make them happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2?start=20,,,,,
34,Allison H.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",135,329,670.0,4.0,2015-10-09,"I would have rated 3 stars for the food, but the strong booze at a reasonable price, paired with good service  made the meal a lot better! I am not a fan of chains and only go to them when there is nothing else open (which happens frequently in Mechanicsburg)  In my opinion, the good was edible but meh. Everything is what one would expect from a chain. Generic. Still, I had a good experience and have had food of the same quality but for much higher prices anywhere else. Come here for a late night meal and drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2,,,,,

37,Rich K.,"Central, PA",1,45,,2.0,2016-04-25,"We had a $25 gift card that we have had for several years and a buy one entree get one free coupon that we always clipped just in case we decided to use the gift card. It has been 12-13 years since we had last eaten at a tgif. Now i know why we don't eat there any longer. We were seated within a reasonable amount of time and had both chosen the jack daniels chicken and shrimp meals along with a beer. The entree was just over $19 and well overpriced. But with a coupon, well, it was still overpriced. The sides we had chosen were fries, mac and cheese and something else that was forgettable. The fries were cheap shoestring that weren't even cooked that well and the mac and cheese looked ok, but had no flavor. But, to be fair, most mac and cheese you get anywhere isn't really good. You get 5-6 shrimp and a small piece of chicken. It tasted like frozen packaged stuff and really had no substance. The staff was nice, but man, $19 for a chicken and shrimp? you couldn't ever get me to eat there again if i was paying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2,,,,,

33,Kevin K.,"Harrisburg, PA",0,18,,2.0,2017-01-21,"I thought the meal was over priced. My wife had the salmon. She is a lite eater, Even she thought it was a small serving of salmon for the price. I always love the ribs at tgi fridays. However I got the jdaniels steak and ribs combo this time. Ribs were great as always. The steak was very poor quality. I ordered medium.... Of course it came out well done.  Tough & grizzly. In my opinion it was overpriced also. Service was good. Beware of the steak.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2,3.56,3.56,3.56,,3.5600000000000005
25,Carolyn R.,"Harrisburg, PA",73,75,313.0,4.0,2017-02-11,"The place that we went is the one in Carlisle pike. Pretty nice place and the people works there are nice too! We got a couple of kids meals and ahi tuna wrap that comes with salad with honey mustard dressing ( so good ). Also specialty burgers too, that comes with fries. They're all pretty good and taste fresh. Should try  the milk shake. They're really good. Price wise not bad at all compare to some chain restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2,3.56,3.56,3.56,,3.5600000000000005
22,Randall G.,"Harrisburg, PA",33,207,445.0,4.0,2017-03-07,"I like TGIF's as a chain restaurant even through its changes over the years ... This location is spacious and although small, the parking lot wraps around the building and I have yet to have trouble finding a space which is always a plus.   Seating again has never been a problem and we have never sat in the lobby waiting for a table.  TGIF is a chain so the menu is generally changing and available online. Burgers & fries, pasta, seafood, chicken and steak ... a little of this and that. They also have a nice appetizer menu and run specials on it.  A good place to stop when traveling with guests who prefer a generalized menu they are more familiar with.  Service here has always been slightly above average. Staff are polite and  have never had a problem having small alterations made to our entrees.  Drinks are overpriced but menu is fair. Coupons and promotions always have been received politely and why we tip on the full bill as you should ;-)  Warning: I love salt but I've noticed this location actually cooks with salt so taste your food prior to salting it or you might not enjoy.   Thanks for waiting on us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2,3.52,3.52,3.52,,3.5200000000000005

29,Steven Z.,"Boiling Springs, PA",40,88,10.0,4.0,2017-04-20,For a chain restraint this place isn't bad the staff is usually extremely nice and helpful and the food is always enjoyable. I really enjoy that they re-tailored their endless apps program to make it a bit more flexible to try more then one type of appetizer.

23,Erica H.,"Marysville, PA",0,19,1.0,2.0,2017-11-25,"Went in last night around 10 PM. I ordered the bruschetta chicken pasta, half size, my boyfriend ordered a burger with endless sides and a long island iced tea. The drink was overly sour.  My pasta was cold and tasted like plastic. It was gross. I ate three bites and couldn't eat any more after that. In addition the endless appetizers we initially went there for that were originally $10 to begin with are now $15 and they took away numerous items from the choices. Yeah, no.

Our waitress had all the answers to our questions, when we ordered drinks she told us some of them would be cheaper in different sizes due to happy hour, and was very accommodating to special requests.  After taking our order she came back and refilled waters and sodas before they were empty and was quick with getting plates out of the way.  The waitress was very attentive, friendly, and really made for a great night out.
