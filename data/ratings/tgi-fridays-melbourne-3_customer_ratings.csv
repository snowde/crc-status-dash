31,Brandon S.,"Fort Pierce, FL",107,302,51.0,2.0,2013-10-26,"This place needs to invest some money into sound absorbing pads on the ceiling/walls. It sounds like you're in an elementary school gym.

38,Sarah B.,"Melbourne, FL",592,77,67.0,3.0,2013-12-17,"Eh.. I just have to say do not order the sizzling chicken and shrimp. The pot stickers are amazing. Maybe it was just a bad night or something, I really don't know. My husband ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasta and the sauce was like water. He said it was missing the Cajun spice.. the sauce didn't have the kick that it usually has. If he weren't starving, it would have gone back to the kitchen. I ordered the Sizzling Chicken & Shrimp. What a let down :( The chicken was dry, cold,  and extremely tasteless. They put cheese on the sizzling platter...... your poor dishwasher! That is so cruel! It sticks to the bottom of the hot plate and literally turns into a hard mess that makes me wonder if the platters ever truly get cleaned. Not even a knife could remove it. The shrimp was decent but the salsa type tomato sauce they use was bland. I asked the server for a sauce.. anything to make the chicken worth eating. She brought me beer cheese sauce? It didnt help at all.  I LOVE Fridays. I love the bartender and the drinks and the atmosphere. MOST of the food we order is on POINT! But this sizzling platter mess needs to be off the menu. It simply just isnt good. The server offered to bring me something else to eat but by this time I was turned off and ready to go. I'm assuming it was just an off night in the kitchen and we'll be back in the future for drinks and appetizers, and I'll gladly review those.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-melbourne-3?start=20,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636

Unfortunately, that was not the case once we entered the establishment. The server was so-so, she was very defensive when we had mentioned the advertisement on yelp for the endless appetizers. Aside from the service, the food was overall drowning in salt. The broccoli and cheese soup as well as the blue cheese wedge was underwhelming. Coming from the west coast I had expected better from a Fridays franchise. A positive note, the mojitos were delicious and 2 for the price of 1!

35,Ginger P.,"Palm Bay, FL",0,28,,4.0,2015-06-16,"I have had consistently good food here. The Jack Daniels Chicken sandwich is one of the best concoctions I have ever had, loaded with crispy little onion rings and melted cheese. One time, though, some of the ingredients were missing and I had to ask for them. The Rib Eye steak is good but overpriced. $20 for a rather thin and not very large steak overall, with two sides but no salad or dinner rolls, is very pricey, but it was tasty and perfectly cooked. The wings are good in a standard sort of way. The Jalapeno appetizers a friend of mine had were, oddly, not stuffed with anything (which I think was a mistake from the kitchen but my friend didn't want to bother returning them) but were indeed real fresh jalapenos, not pickled or frozen, and came  wrapped in bacon. The service is uneven. I've had two different young ladies that were very professional and efficient and one that was overwhelmed with two or three tables at 3 in the afternoon, and brought items separately so not everyone was served at once.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-melbourne-3?start=20,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004

Of course there are some things you will try you will not like or feel you did not get your moneys worth. I find myself always getting the Bruschetta Chicken Pasta. I think you get your moneys worth and it is really good. I love that they use Angel hair pasta. Has a great taste. I do think however the last time I was here the portion did go smaller than it use to be.  The appetizers are good as well as some of the other dishes we have tried. Service always depends on who you get, Some waiters/Waitresses are better than   you know so don't blame the food quality.

28,Vitaly M.,"Melbourne, FL",0,1,,2.0,2016-04-01,"Having been an avid fan if TGIF in the past, and having eaten and enjoyed sesam jack chicken strips in other TGI Fridays establishments, I decided to order one here as an appitzer along with my main course.  It didn't arrive with the other appetizers people ordered. In fact it didn't arrive at all. Instead, a large main course platter of plain chicken tenders arrived, along with the main course that I already ordered. After pointing out to the waiter and manager that this isn't what the chicken strips that are described in the menu or what other TGI Fridays serve, they kept on insisting this was the case. Not wanting to throw a hissyfit, I ate whatever I could of the ludacris sized appitizer, and got the rest to go. Then came the receipt. In which they charged me the amount for the chicken tenders main course, despite the staff repeatedly telling me that what they served me was chicken strips. They can't have it both ways, claiming my meal is an appitizer, and charge me for the full meal. Instead, for whatever reason, they messed up my order, insisted that somehow I was in the wrong, but then charged me extra for their mistake.  As far as the food quality goes, it's somewhat below the standards than other TGIF establishments in more popular cities. Other people in the group seemed to be satisfied with their food though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-melbourne-3?start=20,,,,,

We ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp..after waiting for quite some time..the waiter came over and told us the cook dropped our chicken on the floor so he was cooking another piece. Waiting a little longer our food finally came out..not ""sizzling"" and minus the shrimp. We ask for our shrimp..few long minutes later he brings it out..and says there's no charge..well dummy it came with our meal so how is there no charge.

13,George B.,"Palm Bay, FL",34,31,30.0,2.0,2016-07-20,"This restaurant hasn't let me down until recently. Before I write this review, I want to say that TGIF has been one of my favorite places to eat, with great service, and good food, but my last 3 visits there over the last couple of months has had me seeking out a new old faithful. I also eat there more than I should because I'm a rewards member, accumulating points with each visit which will eventually lead to free food, and perks such as no waiting (jumping to the front of the line).  Keeping up with my theme of the summer of BBQ,  I got an email saying that a rib dinner was $10, so of course I was having ribs. For the first time I tried their jack Daniels ribs, which looked great in the pictures. When I got the plate the ribs looked like a dry pale slab of ribs, and what looked like someone opened a packet of chunky grape jelly, and smeared it across the top down the middle, reminding me of a skunk stripe. I looked around to see if I was being pranked, expecting the someone to point out the cameras, and cackle at the look on my face. Unfortunately there were no cameras no host and some of the nastiest barbecue ribs that I've ever had. I didn't complain, I watched the movie Waiting, so I know better. The once mighty TGIF has fallen from my list of go to places to eat. The time before I decided to try the hot southern chicken, which in my mind would be like the Nashville spicy chicken KFC was serving, but it was nothing like it. It was nothing like the photos, basically it was some chicken tenders lightly drizzled with buffalo wing sauce. The time before that I had the pick 3 sides, those delicious green been fries, yummy pot stickers, and the chicken wings, but the wings were undercooked. Nothing like raw wings to make your day. I did have a really good meal when I ordered the bourbon barrel Mahi Mahi, and the only thing I didn't like about that was the small portion size.  In conclusion, I will return but not for ribs. And it's still much better than chills, who can't seen to get their act together, or fix their taste problems.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-melbourne-3,,,,,

I really do like to go to tgi Fridays, went in any locations but this one is very bad. Went twice and got very bad experience. The waitresses don't really care of you. With my husband we ordered our drinks, mine arrived right away and had to ask again for my husband one after 10 min. After that we haven't see our waitress again until the check. Our food arrived cold, it may happen so we asked to warm it up to an other waitress who gave us our plates. The manager came back and changed our plate right away. But where is our waitress ? My husband asked 3 times to get a refill for his drink. Still waiting on it. The service is very poor in that restaurant. I'm a waitress too and I'm really not an annoying customer and always calm down my husband when he get upset since I know his it work.
