7,John W.,"Melbourne, Australia",72,200,63.0,5.0,2013-10-12,Normally I wouldn't write a review about restaurant chains however this one has won my heart and soul. TGI Fridays Melbourne Central is very conveniently located in the heart if Melbourne very close to RMIT. It offers a great all round American menu from Burgers to Tex Mex.  I also love this place because it does express lunches for the suits that can be preordered online. There is also a fabulous outdoor deck which would be awesome for a boozy lunch! Try it.  You won't be disappointed!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-melbourne-5,,,,,
6,Danny B.,"Melbourne, Australia",197,270,262.0,5.0,2014-03-24,"I absolutely had an awesome experience here! What a great venue. Great size and great layout! Love it! We went as a group and sat on the balcony with great view of the state library! Happy hour was on and drinks were cheap so a few Long Island ice teas for me, and they were yummy! Then onto the food, I had the jack Daniels burger, delicious meaty and great flavours! Such a nice joy! Another friend enjoyed Mexican wrap and she raved about it. Everyone the the group was joyed with the food and drinks. Had a real great time here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-melbourne-5,,,,,
0,Aaron W.,"North Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia",1,2,,5.0,2014-04-27,"Awesome place! The food is amazing. The staff are friendly and enthusiastic. It's got a great vibe inside suitable for just about anyone. To too if off, the location is also perfect with the outside area overlooking Swanston St. and the State Library.  This is definitely one of my favourite places in Melbourne and one of the common places I take friends new to Melbourne too. Judging by how crowded the place can be at times, I'm sure a lot of others also agree with me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-melbourne-5,,,,,
11,Emily C.,"Melbourne, Australia",12,63,10.0,2.0,2014-05-16,"Went there on a Tuesday night, ordered 2 burgers, and had to wait about 45 minutes for them even though the restaurant was mostly empty. Were nearly late to a concert, was at the point of 'in 5 more minutes we're walking out and cancelling the order' before they actually came out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-melbourne-5,,,,,
9,Stephen D.,"Adelaide, Australia",32,33,16.0,5.0,2014-11-29,"Superb chain resturan. Great food. So much to chooae from.

4,Alex F.,"Sydney, Australia",51,72,114.0,3.0,2015-04-12,Great Service and atmosphere! Food ok but not amazing!  Would definitely recommend to friends for a social cocktail and some desert! Order the Turtle Mmmmmmmmm,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-melbourne-5,,,,,
8,Siobhan B.,"Melbourne, Australia",25,46,11.0,1.0,2015-07-26,"I can't eat their food as it's not suitable for Coeliacs, but I can comment on service and drinks.   When I walked in and said I wanted to get a drink I was told I could sit at the bar.  I sit down only to be told by the manager I needed to move around the other side of the bar.  Eh whatever. The place looks like it's American counterpart and obviously they are going for the American sports bar feel but they miss the mark.   When I sat down a second time I noticed my favourite beer I used to drink in the States - Blue Moon.  Years ago I looked for this and just couldn't find it in Australia.  I can now no longer drink regular beer as it is not gluten free and was prepared to be very disappointed but luckily for me (not the other customers) the plastic on the taps told me they don't actually have it.. whew! I asked for a cider (which was on the happy hour list) only to find they didn't have it on tap even though they had a tap for it. Asked about happy hour wines and they only had one option for white which was too sweet.  Nevermind, plenty of other places have chardonnay I'll just go elsewhere for that. Finally settled on a bourbon and diet coke.  The post mix was soooo watery and flavourless. .truly the worst mixed drink I've had.  Horrible. The bar tender was not unfriendly but not very interested.  Shame considering they are going for the American bar feel as the service is certainly something you do get in the States. Judging by other comments, I'm guessing you get better service when you do order food (and perhaps don't care that the drinks you want aren't on tap or taste watery).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-melbourne-5,,,,,
10,James L.,"Markham, Canada",272,14,3.0,1.0,2015-08-05,"garbage food would not come back , just as bad as the ones in the states. food quality doesn't justify even the cheap pricing , better off going to McDonald's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-melbourne-5,,,,,
5,Lola T.,"Sarasota, FL",22,581,175.0,2.0,2016-02-29,"Been in Melbourne for a couple of weeks and really wanted a bit of American food.  One can only eat so much teriyaki chicken, ramen and rice bowls. The menu is not like the Friday's in the US.  I ordered the appetizer with three plates to share, Mac and cheese balls not very good, tastes like Kraft mac & cheese on the inside, very dry. I thought it would be more like the fried mac & cheese at The Cheesecake Factory, another US staple. The fajita nachos were terrible, all onion, very little meat, one of the four nachos didn't even have any chicken at all. I ordered a mudslide from the bar and it was excellent.  Service was good too.   Unfortunately I will not go back if I am looking for real American food as this menu is not that...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-melbourne-5,,,,,
3,Anm P.,"Sydney, Australia",0,14,7.0,5.0,2016-05-09,I went to the one in New York last year and it was absolutely disgusting !!

2,Kaitlin W.,"Sydney, Australia",1,6,1.0,5.0,2016-09-17,"Now that is some fine ass New York cheesecake I got dished up to me. YES! Brilliant. If you want the real deal, you have a hankering for Cheesecake. Go to TGIF. I really love the tower too. Really good to know where this little ripper is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-melbourne-5,,,,,
1,Li K.,"Brisbane, Australia",13,7,3.0,3.0,2017-08-21,"The portion size was not as big when comparing to the price that you paid for it but it was delicious! I had the jack daniels ribs and the sauce was yummy! Loved the cocktails and the price was good but i loved the selections. If your seating outside on a Friday or Saturday then I hope you dont mind it being abit loud as next door as a pub/club. Also, definitely recommend booking as the place is very popular.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-melbourne-5,,,,,
