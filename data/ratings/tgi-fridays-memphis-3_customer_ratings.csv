On another occasion, I had the Jack Daniels Chicken Sandwich.  This is quite a sandwich.  I tend to go for lighter fare, so this was a lot of food.  It had onion rings in the sandwich, and a pretty rich sauce, which was good, but definitely not light.   I was actually hesitant to go to any Friday's, because I travel a lot, and like to experience the local food, not the same heavy stuff at a different Friday's.   But I was pleasantly surprised by the service, and the food.   I did go on off times, so there was literally no wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-3?start=40,2.032,2.032,2.032,2.032,2.032

The management should have known every hotel was sold out for 12/30.  The parade for the Liberty bowl finished up and Fridays filled up.  My favorite part was when 2 employees ( who according to management were in training)  Sat near the front window with drinks, dessert, and a menu to take a break.  I even asked the manager why he did not get the employees back to work. He said they had only been trained for 3 days.  I think it is poor form to have employees taking breaks in the dining room.  Clearly the staff could not get food or drinks out with the staff they had.  The 2 managers never stepped in. There were many angry customers.

First, it smells worse than Bourbon Street on a 100 degree Sunday morning.  I don't know how it is possible to have that smell inside of a Fridays.  It smells like swill.  Perhaps they should think about adding a little bleach to their mop water. Second, the few people we interacted with simply do not like their job and they let you know it and this included one of the managers.  It is not just the normal coldness you might get from someone who has a bad day.  No, it was more like a general crummy non-helpful attitude.  Although, I will say the hostess was friendly.  The bartender and manager were not.   We got some drinks and moved on.  The smell was just too bad to actually eat food there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-3?start=40,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000004

Very bland, just basically lettuce with tomatoes & ""marinated"" chicken. Try, cold chicken bread with some sauce smeared on it...

13,Angela B.,"Nashville, TN",51,156,110.0,1.0,2016-02-28,"Ew.  I don't even know where to start.  We tried this place twice thinking maybe Day 1 was a fluke.  Nope. We stayed at the Doubletree Hilton that is attached to the Fridays.  As a Hilton Diamond Rewards member, I was told that breakfast at the Fridays was complimentary.  Ok--we can check it out.   When we walked in the door, there was a server sitting down at a table who told us we could sit wherever we wanted.  We looked around.  All of the open tables were dirty.  So somebody said they would clean off the table and get us coffee and water.  They said the buffet included omelets made to order.  I asked the server for an omelet.  She said she would put in the order.  We went through the buffet line and then sat down.  A different server was serving us at our table.  After waiting about 20 minutes, we asked server number 2 about my omelet.  She had no idea there was an omelet ordered for me.  She disappeared.  A third person came out and said my omelet would be coming up.  Apparently nobody put in the order.  When the omelet came out, it was undercooked.  Runny eggwhites.  Not good. The food on the buffet was okay.  Fresh fruit, cereal, juice, oatmeal, scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy.  It was okay for a buffet. The real issue was the service.  While the servers were very nice, they were very slow.   Day 2.  Let's try this again.  Walked in.  Knew we could sit wherever.  Dirty tables again.  Was offered a table and somebody would come by to clean it up.  The table across from us had an overflowing bus tub on the table.  Just sitting there.  Full.  Dishes scattered around on the table.  Trash on the floor.  Nobody came to pick it up.  It was there when we got there and 45 minutes into our breakfast, it was still there.  No excuse for it.  The restaurant was not even busy.  I finally picked up the trash on the floor and put it in the bus tub because I did not want somebody to step or trip on it.   My omelet was ordered and came to me in a timely fashion.  Eggwhites cooked.  Good.  Now where's that coffee?  It took a while for our server to come back.  We asked for a refill on coffee and she said it was brewing.  We waited and waited...and waited.  In the meantime, ALL of the tables around us were empty and dirty.   Nobody was wiping anything up.  Somebody came from the back and picked up the bus tub.  But left the other dishes on the table.  Then another bus tub appeared on the table next to it with dishes in it.  That one stayed on the table until we left.   I saw the manager in the bar area taking stools off tables as he prepared to open for the restaurant.  I never saw him walking around the open ""breakfast"" area of the restaurant to see how things were.  Then a woman came in by herself.  He walked her over to our area and there were no clean tables.  He called out ""Any clean tables back here?""  And then sat her in the back.  WTF?  Doesn't he see the gross, dirty state of his dining room? I just don't know where restaurant standards went at this place.  Heck, where did ANY standards go?? Don't go to Fridays.  Not even for a free breakfast.  If the dining area that customers can actually see is this dirty, I can only imagine with the kitchen looks like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-3,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
33,Amy S.,"Batesville, MS",1,23,11.0,1.0,2016-03-05,My husband and I would have loved to have eaten here. I work around Southaven and finally had an opportunity to stop. We had to stop a waitress to even get seated because there was no hostess manning the door. She ended up getting a guy (possibly a Manager because he had on a polo shirt) to seat us. We noticed several empty tables which were all dirty walking back to our table. The floor was also filthy. We were given menus which were dirty and sticky. After sitting there for 10 mins (we waited 5 mins at the door waiting to be noticed) we got up and left. We had 3 servers pass our table along with the same guy that seated us and no one ever spoke to us or offered to wait on us.

The bar at this Fridays is 5 stars.  The margarita I am drinking right now rivals Los Angeles' best.  It is a flawless Sauza Anejo cocktail with a Grand Marnier base.  I LOVE the bar at this Fridays. The food is better than the folks whom write bad reviews.  Yesterday I had a chicken cobb salad to go which was 5 stars.  Right now I am eating loaded potato skins.  They are delicious.

So we thought they were going to clear a table for us.  In the mean time, customers were walking into the restaurant and were getting seated immediately and we had waited for over an hour while by the time we decided to walk out and go somewhere else there were 8 tables empty but full of dirty dishes.  As a restaurant owner myself, this would absolutely never happen at our place.  Customer service should be your #1 priority.  Without customers you have nothing.  Now I see why this location only has 2 1/2 stars.  EPIC FAIL TGI FRIDAYS!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-3,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
