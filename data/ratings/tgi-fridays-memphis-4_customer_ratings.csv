15,Chris C.,"Brentwood, TN",11,122,8.0,1.0,2012-05-16,"Disgusting and the service was poor. I ate at the bar. Literally if you closed your eyes and you has the sensation you are in a strip club - or how your imagine one to be like.  The thumping base of the music was bone rattling. The smell was moldy and warmed over ""Cosmo Mix"".  The place was packed and it was under staffed so I'll give the servers a bit of a pass. Yet, my order (after 20 min) was lost and the guy shrugged and said its simply lost...... So I ordered again - a hamburger this time (less chance to screw it up) and it was greasy and very salty. By this time I would eat a Sysco hamburger and I'm pretty sure that is what it was.  While Fridays is not an epicurean utopia but I do expect decent service and edible food.

At TGI Fridays, that is exactly what I do. I always order the cajun chicken and shrimp pasta and the vanilla bean cheesecake. I'm a believer of, if its broke don't fix it. These two dishes are very good and I absolutely love them and for that I will always come here and dine.  The restaurant is very good and the service is excellent if you come to dine during lunch hours.

This location closes at midnight, so that was pretty convenient, as we'd just gotten in town and thought they were closing much earlier than they did. Our server was a cool, laidback guy. My mom & I tried to be health-conscious and ordered the grilled chicken with sauteed veggies. A tomato/mozarella salad came along with it, but I don't like tomatoes, so our server traded the salad in for mashed potatoes (as if I needed the starch- ha). By the way, the ""mozarella"" did NOT taste like cheese at all, so I highly doubt that was actual cheese. It really tasted fake.  The chicken definitely tasted like it was less than 500 calories, but it was so rubbery-textured. The veggies were okay. The mashed potatoes were good, and the drink was great. This is a pretty decent location- spacious and clean. I'll give 'em a solid 3 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4?start=20,1.6760000000000002,1.6760000000000002,1.6760000000000002,1.6760000000000002,1.6760000000000002
29,Samantha B.,"Collierville, TN",217,763,2516.0,4.0,2015-01-25,"I came here this past week with my mother and husband after a trip to Costco. I had specifically requested this place as we had all come once before with my dad as well and had an enjoyable experience. But alas, that was before I discovered Yelp, so I have no idea what I got.  Our waiter was named Jonathan and it was his first day ever as a waiter. Unlucky for him, the menu doesn't say some things, like that Parmesan fries cost a little extra when substituted. So there were a few moments where he had to run and ask something, but we were fine with it. He did a great job and my husband only trolled him a little bit, such as asking if he could get his drink to go just to watch the guy's eyes widen with uncertainty. (Hubby rarely gets his drink to go and never a soda to go).  The food itself was great. I found a number of things that appealed to me, making me want to come back and try them all. I was in an odd mood for Asian and so went with one of their asian-themed dishes, the Hibachi Chicken Skewers. I would've gotten some dumplings too if I'd seen them sooner. Hubby and Mom got different rib meals.  I adored my Hibachi Chicken Skewers. They were glazed with miso and tasted so so so sweet. The soy sauce on them mixed perfectly with the jasmine rice pilaf. I totally don't associate broccoli with Asian food, even though I grew up eating beef and broccoli, but that was a good move on their part. It tasted great both eaten separately and mixed in with everything. The grilled pita was the most surprising part of the meal but it also went well with everything.  My husband and mother were not impressed by the ribs in any way. Mom said there wasn't enough meat and my husband agreed and added that his were very dry. The only thing we all agreed on was that this place seemed unusually slow. Personally, I loved what I got and I remember having a good experience before as well. I will definitely come back, but likely with friends instead.  To Try:  - Sizzling Chicken and Spinach - Cajun Shrimp and Chicken Pasta - dumplings (in the Jack Daniel's appetizer combo) Loved:  - Hibachi Chicken Skewers - broccoli - jasmine rice pilaf - grilled pita Ok: - Half Rack Baby Back Ribs - Jack Daniel's Mixed Grill  Nah:  - Parmesan Steak Fries - Mashed Potatoes",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4,1.8720000000000003,1.8720000000000003,1.8720000000000003,1.8720000000000003,1.8720000000000003

Our waiter was new but he was awesome: friendly, courteous, and patient. I wish him the best of luck.  After eating my dried out ribs with very very little meat on them, and a six ounce sirloin that had more chewy parts (fat? gristle?) than not, I felt disgusted. It was so bad I don't want to eat steak or ribs from anywhere for a while. At all. I definitely don't want to come back here. Not only that, but the food came out cold. Probably because it took forever to come out. I was having a good night before we came here and didn't want to complain about the food and force us to have to wait through another far-too-long wait. I just wanted to leave.

She was covering numerous tables within the bar section alone.  Which in turn made it take a long time for drinks and refills on both food and drink.  It's idiotic to not be running at full staff and coverage on the weekends day and night.  Customers don't want to be there for hours to eat and I'm sure neither does the staff.  The less customers they can turn in and out, the less tip opportunity they have a chance for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4?start=20,1.6760000000000002,1.6760000000000002,1.6760000000000002,1.6760000000000002,1.6760000000000002

6,Chanel T.,"La Mesa, CA",61,23,32.0,1.0,2016-06-18,"I am elated to provide this review. Management really needs to look into revamping this entire place. I will say, if they could get the review of 1/4 of a star, they would. Just known that the star is for the nice music. The service was SOOOOOOOOO SLOW!!!!! I sat and counted 3 servers walk by our table repeatedly. It took about 15 minutes before someone (the young lady who walked by the table multiple times without even saying ""hello"" or ""I'll be with you in a moment"") finally came and took our drink orders. They got the drink orders wrong lol. Not surprised. Oh, the hostess is 100% unsanitary; she sat us at a filthy table, I'm not tripping because I'm assuming she would return with a towel to wipe the table. She took one of the old used napkins and decided to wipe the table down with it. LMAO WTF. They took soooooooooo long to bring out our food. They forgot my appetizer and brought it out after we started eating our meal (she did apologize for that). The hostess had a party (1 party) waiting for 30 minutes for a table in the bar area... there were 2 large enough empty tables but there was nobody to clean them. I can say I saw one person trying to get on the lazy hostess. My advice to management... fire majority of the staff and hire new people that are eager to work but include thorough customer service training because it's what's killing the vibe. It's so bad.

Well, they did have Drake playing louder than normal over the speakers, however, that changed once other people arrived and they changed the volume/station promptly (lol).

22,Whitney H.,"Memphis, TN",2,121,49.0,3.0,2017-02-19,"Overall: Chain restaurant. Food expectations were low, but ""safe."" We had a gift card.  Initial: While it wasn't busy when we arrived, there was not a host or waitress at the front of the restaurant to greet or seat us. Along with our hungry party of two, there was a family waiting to be seated. In our awkward look around and wait, we had a couple of servers look at us and then scurry away. Eventually one of the servers came over and sat us at a table (not her own), only to have the hostess reappear and tell her she didn't do the rotation right. We were upfront in an empty restaurant for about 10 minutes,  for the sake of customer service the server did the right thing. The hostess was very unprofessional... but that seems to be a bit of the norm here. Product: TGIFridays is a safe food bet ( read: flash fried chicken tenders/sky-high nachos with cheese/ some warm cake with a glob of ice cream), but isn't a true testament to a Memphis culinary experience. The menu is robust enough to have an option for absolutely everyone from gluten free to vegan to Chain restaurant experimental (i.e Sriracha-anything) .  Expect a diverse crowd, and an opportunity to people watch and overhear everything. It's safe to say that TGIFridays is more of a sports bar with an attractive mozzarella/chicken tender/ fruit syrup cocktail happy hour.    Customer Service:  Shanekwa was our server and was very attentive and friendly. She answered questions and brought the food out at a timely manner. She apologized for the hostess drama from before. The Other Deets: She told us about the TGIF App that would give us a free appetizer. It's apparent that TGIFriday's Corporate is really working on getting people to use this app. Truly there is no real point unless the app let's you pre-order for pick-up, integrate with Seamless, and receive discounts. It does calculate points to get you free things, however unless you are a regular it will continue to be a download-use code-delete application. Wishlist: I had better expectations for the happy hour cocktails. I don't blame this on the bartender. Fresher ingredients and house made simple syrups will really elevate this portion of the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002

28,Carolyn D.,"Memphis, TN",0,21,,1.0,2017-09-15,"I give TGI Friday's a 1 rating because of how management of the restaurant have no respect for patron reservations. Today I called to make a reservation for lunch tomorrow 11 guests for 1 pm. I was told they only make reservations online. So I went to their website, clicked on reservations and followed directions. I gave the number in my party using a drop down menu of 1-12. I chose 11, the time 1:00 pm. Next, I put in my first and last name, telephone number and email address. Then clicked on book the table. The table was not booked. I got the caption ""Please put in your last name correctly"". I tried again and again, finally getting the caption 'Please put in your last name"", remove and try again. I did that, then realized something was not right. They don't know me from Adam. After about 2-3 minute I get ""We don't do reservations for more than 6 guests. Okay, so I say why do you have 12 in the drop down menu? The person answering the phone did not tell me that they only do reservations for 6 people. What a bunch of ""Crock"". I did not find this humorous, nor did I see this as a restaurant who cares about patrons. I will never try to go there again. I will tell everyone I know to never choose TGI Friday's for a lunch or dinner party. Furthermore, do not patronize the restaurant because it appears to be a poorly managed business. The food is not that great, but I am in a Birthday Club and decided to go somewhere different this year for my guests. Fridays has been around for a while and they don't have good ratings as noted today. I say Stay Away!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002
25,Brian F.,"Clarksville, TN",0,1,,1.0,2017-09-24,I can't give this place anything less than 1 star because there is nothing less than one star. Horrible service at the bar. Took way to long for the amount of people in the restaurant. Will never come here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4,1.64,1.64,1.64,,1.6400000000000001
24,Fred B.,"Edison, NJ",0,4,,1.0,2017-10-25,"Poor service. Arrived there on a Tuesday night around 9 PM. Approximately 25 customers in the place.Took the staff several long minutes before we were seated. Waiter took our drink order. When the drinks arrived, a waitress starting giving the waiter a hard time. Apparently she thought it was her table and he thought it was his. From here the service only got worse. My advice is to avoid this place at all costs. Fred Bee",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4,1.56,1.56,1.56,,1.5600000000000003
20,Randy M.,"Olive Branch, MS",0,11,4.0,2.0,2017-10-29,"Food was delicious. However, the service here was TERRIBLE! Seats were dirty due to the busser wiping the table off and pushing any food particles on the seats and not cleaning the seats.. We actually saw them do it to another empty table. Secondly, a waiter took our drink order and never came back. We witnessed another table talking to the manager complaining about their experience. Thirdly, as we patiently wait for our drinks and food order, we see 5 employees up front standing around talking and not busy working. This place used to have great service, but now it's a shame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4,1.56,1.56,1.56,,1.5600000000000003
