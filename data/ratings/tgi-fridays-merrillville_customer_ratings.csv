3,Kelly B.,"Shelby, IN",152,120,682.0,3.0,2013-12-27,Let me start by saying that TGI Friday's atmosphere & vibe are great BUT they need to have a deep-cleaning done! Tables were dirty & seats were sticky...  The staff here seems to be quite genial and they are pretty much on top of things. The menu isn't Vegan friendly at all. Luckily the manager was generous with his time in helping to accommodate my dietary needs.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merrillville?start=20,1.9320000000000002,1.9320000000000002,1.9320000000000002,1.9320000000000002,1.9320000000000004

29,Maddison B.,"Warsaw, IN",13,8,13.0,1.0,2015-02-10,"Lunch Prices??? Cold Soup??? Think again.  We stopped by on a Monday around noon. When ordering, I clearly pointed at a lunch priced combo of soup and salad. It should have been around $8. My husband ordered the same thing. Instead of bringing the lunch portions, our waitress brought us the regular portions and charged us for that. It end up being about $12 more than what we had originally ordered! On top of that, our soup was brought out to us COLD. Our waitress sat around and talked while we tried to get her to come to our table. (We were one of only 2 tables in the whole restaurant!!!)  When the soup was reheated, it was still thick and floury. The salad was pretty bland. We will absolutely never go to this TGI Friday's ever again, and probably never go to another one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merrillville,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002

8,V K.,"Chicago, IL",7,9,,1.0,2015-05-10,"I've had salads at other TGIs in Illinois and decided to try this one in Merrillville and I have no desire to return. Visited on Saturday May 2, on a beautiful sunny afternoon. The two Caucasian women assigned to greet customers were very unpleasant and stern. There were a few customers present but they were all seated in the same generalized area. My guest and I were taken to a booth in the same area and strongly told to wait until the mass of food under our table was sweep up. We independently went to sit at another booth and one of the very unfriendly greeters told us that the section was closed and quickly walked away and never directed us to another section. We returned to the front of the restaurant and ended up sitting in the bar area. The area  was surprisingly quieter than the compact area were they were continuing to set  the few customers that came into the restaurant. Derrick, the bar attendant served us and was he was very pleasant. The food was so-so.  Wanted dessert, but decided to go elsewhere. Went across the street to Red Robin's and was greeted well by smiling staff.  Stopped by Chili's the week before and it was filled with customers. Even on the day of my visit to TGI's, I glanced across the road at Chili's parking lot and it was pretty full. If customer's are being treated like we were then I see why there are so few customers patronizing the restaurant. Competition is stiff, learn how to treat your customers. Some people are not meant to be greeters and will likely reduce your profit margin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merrillville?start=20,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003
1,Adrienne W.,"Valparaiso, IN",44,96,,1.0,2015-06-28,"Let me preface this by saying that I have never been a huge fan of this chain. It's not a place I ever pick to go but I will go if others I am with choose to. Therefore, I had low expectations going in. My last experience here earlier this month, which is very likely to be my absolute last, was pretty terrible. Just blew those already low expectations away. I seriously wish I could give them a negative rating.  We had a group of 8 and Friday's was chosen because we were celebrating the birthday of a recently deceased friend who had loved this place. We planned on going here ahead of time so we attempted to make a reservation. We were told they did not take reservations. We showed up at 5:00 on a Thursday night - told it would be 40 minutes for a table since we had such a large group. Apparently, the only option for a large group is an oversized booth which was currently occupied. We asked if they would be willing to push some tables together and they said it was against their policy. I would understand an unwillingness to push tables together if it was busy but the restaurant was less than half full and likely to stay that way since it was a weekday. The only suggestion the snotty hostess made was that she could seat us at separate tables near each other. We were not willing to sit separately given the reason for our gathering that night and quite frankly did not see the point of going out as a group just to sit separately. So, they won't take a reservation but are unable (unwilling, really) to accommodate more than one large group at a time? What business does this? We asked to speak with the manager and he just reiterated this policy as if we didn't understand the first time. Blank stare when we explained the stupidity of this policy. I don't know if this is a corporate policy or a rule for this particular location, but either way, this place clearly did not want our business.  We finally were seated about 50 minutes later. It took forever to get drinks, food, checks, really anything requested. We all understand that things take a little longer with a large group but the length of time it took to get anything was ridiculous even for a group. The food was mediocre at best. The portions were so ridiculously small for the price. It's like they spend more time trying to plan what else they can add to their stupid Jack Daniel's menu that they forget how to just do the basics and give people a decent amount of food. I ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp and the size of the chicken breast was smaller than what would be recommended for someone on a very strict diet and 4 shrimp...for $13. Not worth it. With an appetizer, two drinks, my meal and a sandwich our bill was $50! Um, seriously? When I received my slip to sign for my credit card transaction I saw that the waitress ran my card for $175. When I showed her the mistake she seemed so confused and didn't know what she did. Eventually figured it out. She never apologized either. An honest mistake or an attempt to rip me off? You decide... The best part of this whole experience (and ""best"" is dripping with sarcasm): As we walked to our table we noticed two tables pushed together with 7 people near us. Interesting... And surprisingly enough, as we were sitting in our booth shoved in like a bunch of sardines and elbowing each other each time someone moved an inch, we watched a group of 10 come in and get seated in two tables close to each other. Once the hostess left they proceeded to push the tables together and not a single employee said anything to them. Not even the manager when he walked by. The hostess walked by to seat another table in the middle of them rearranging the furniture and said NOTHING. We still can't figure out why this was OK for that table and not for ours. Not one person in our group was loud or rude, even when speaking to the manager. I don't know what we did to receive such unfair treatment but I'm not about to go back and find out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merrillville?start=20,,,,,

2,Bruce W.,"St. Charles, IL",0,17,,1.0,2015-08-10,"During the summer the restaurant was extremely cold. When we asked them to adjust the temperature, it changed a very small amount. My wife's food was cold, and her chicken breast was fattier than normal. The plates were relatively small and I would have liked for some more in my portion. I have dined at Friday's before and this location is definitely below average. I would have stayed for dessert but It was too cold!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merrillville?start=20,,,,,
6,Carol T.,"Crown Point, IN",0,9,,2.0,2015-10-20,"It's time to close TGI Fridays remodel the restaurant, and gut the stinky washrooms. The restaurant decor hasn't changed in over 20 years they need to get rid of items from the 60's and 70's. Like the picture of Marilyn Monroe who died in 1962. Friday's food is ok but stick to the regular items( cheese burgers, chicken bruschetta pasta or chicken sandwiches). We understand the restaurants chain was recently sold so hopefully changes will be coming soon. Sad to say TGI Friday's is no longer our ""to go place""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merrillville?start=20,,,,,
28,Lizzie M.,"Near Southside, Chicago, IL",0,12,,2.0,2015-12-07,"Now I see why nobody goes to TGI Fridays anymore.  Met a friend for drinks this evening, we sat in the bar area, which was dead (as was the restaurant). My friend was waiting for me and had already ordered a drink; I had to wait 10-15 minutes for the server to come by and take my drink order. We were never asked if we wanted water or if we wanted to order apps or dinner. Our drinks sat empty for 15 minutes until I decided to stare the servers down (they were super busy chatting behind the bar , although facing us). One reluctantly came by and asked if we wanted another round. We said yes, and before we could say we wanted to order apps she turned her back and went to the bar. We finally were able to ask her if we could order as she set our drinks down. We received our apps and had to ask for plates. The servers never came by to ask how the food was, and after we finished eating had to flag one of the servers down for a final round of drinks.  TGI. Fridays corporate leadership would be devastated if they saw the industry's target market being treated like garbage while there are a hundred-us empty seats in their restaurant. Too bad for them as we're millennials/ young GenX, both with six-figure incomes, and our friends/acquaintances are of similar profiles. Too bad for us because we would love to make a place like this our regular spot, considering the $3 (and well-made) martinis and decent appetizers (although the spinach flatbread taste like unbaked pita bread smothered in cream cheese).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merrillville,,,,,

20,Tiffany N.,"Valparaiso, IN",18,60,283.0,1.0,2016-08-14,"I come to Friday's a lot (almost every week or two). I usually sit in the bar area for the five dollar apps but we sat in the restaurant area this visit to celebrate a birthday.  Food was ok. Service seemed slow for the small amount of people in the restaurant.  We received our Stripes chips and then our beer cheese pretzel app shortly after. We then all had our meals brought to us except for the chicken fingers dinner. The waitress finally came around and we mentioned we were missing a meal. She never mentioned the reason or even apologized. She just stated it will be out shortly. Everyone else pretty much were done with their meals by the time it finally came out. After seeing the *rush* on the receipt, that tells me the order didn't get entered initially. I understand mistakes happen, but I don't appreciate her not acknowledging the issue. She also tried taking the appetizer that still had food on it. I had to ask her to leave it as we were still all eating from it.  We had a Stripes reward coupon that took forever to register. Half of our party left before we were done paying since it took so long.  Lastly, on our way out the staff that seats people and opens the doors were inattentive. There were about 5 teenage girls just talking while grandma had to wait for one of us to hold the doors open for her since she walks with a cane. I am a regular Yelp reviewer since I travel a lot and don't just review when I have a negative experience. I hope the management at this location can learn from this to ensure others have a better experience than we had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merrillville,,,,,

Went in last night for dinner and a drink, sat at the bar with my boyfriend because we wanted to see the end of the Cubs game. But the bartender was kinda a jerk. Treated my boyfriend very disrespectful. I was kind astonished, I know it's Halloween weekend and maybe him having to wear a Svengoolie looking costume was a bit much but don't take it out on us. My boyfriend the sweet natured guy he is was like what the f*@k I'm not going to let this idiot ruin my night out. I was let's go I'm not patronizing a place that is disrespectful to its customers.

27,Armand A.,"Merrillville, IN",19,2,,1.0,2016-12-22,"On 12/21 me and a friend went to this horrible place.  We walked in and noticed several booths open in the bar area.  Decided to sit there. Upon walking up to the tables we noticed that none of them were clean.  We stood there for at least 5 min with 3 people behind the bar and not one person acknowledged us. Now I'm not one to play the race card, but we are black and every patron in the bar area was white. As we watched them continue to serve everyone else but us!  HMMM...So we decided to sit in the main dining room, and were told they had no booths.  So the kind hostess offered to bust one of the tables and the manager scolded her for doing this. At this point we were pissed. Thinking that this mgr was going to come and help us. Not the case. We just left and definitely will never return! Should have gone to Schereville like normal, but this is actually closer.  Never again will I ever step foot in that place again. PEOPLE LISTEN! DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION EVER!

He also tried to make it seem like someone on staff was posing as a manager.
