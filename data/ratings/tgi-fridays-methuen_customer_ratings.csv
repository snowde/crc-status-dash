39,Linda M.,"North Andover, MA",0,23,,2.0,2012-08-10,"Typical chain. By that I mean:  everything is pre-prepared (for consistency and cost management) and heated for you when you order it.    If you like that, feel free to go.   There are some meal deals that are reasonably priced but if you don't like any of the choices the rest of the menu is a rip-off.   Our food was not heated enough, had to be sent back ( I'll admit, doing that always scares me, but who wants to eat a cold meal? ) Upside: the fried green beans appetizer were a bit different and good                The salty caramel dessert was awesome. Just an OK choice if you're stuck on where to go and are in the area.  We had limited time before a movie and left full and not broke.  Hence,  one star for convenience and the other for the meal deal (13. For appetizer, entree, and dessert). Luckily we had one of the more experienced waitresses, she did very well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen?start=60,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152

First contact from the waitress took over 10 minutes, after the drink order (soda) another 10 minutes. From the sit down, to the drinks, 20 minutes. Place was DEAD as well.  Food was bland, no seasoning or flavor. My daughter wanted butter on her kids meal, never got it. Asked another waitress that we flagged down, she never came back.

76,Leo Z.,"Salem, NH",123,193,,2.0,2013-09-09,"I stopped going here a few years ago. One of the chicken strips I had ordered was not fully cooked and the manager had the audacity to say, ""Only one piece was under cooked"". Mr. Dumbass must have received his culinary education from Mickey Mouse University. It's been three or four years & he's probably on the unemployment line so I thought I'd try them again.   They have a huge bar, sat and had a bite. Service from the bartenders was very good (the bar was only 1/2 full). The place has been remodeled and they did a good job, the bar area is open and not cluttered. They could turn down the loud crazy music, it's tough to have a conversation or watch a game. Ordered the shrimp & chicken with mashed potatoes. I laughed when they brought my dish; the portion size is a joke..overly SMALL.  Two pieces of chicken, both combined are not the size of one normal size chicken breast. Four pieces of shrimpy shrimp and two small scoops of potatoes. It's pretty bad when they cheap out on the mashed potatoes, to make it worse they are made from a box (powdered?).  I'm not a big guy and I could have easily has two of these meals to at least feel satisfied. What a friggin joke, all for 13 bucks. The drinks/beer is priced about average...ho hum...  The chain Fridays has been around for a long time, maybe too long. It is the quintessential corporate chain restaurant. Overly salted & sugared food with tight portion control. If you're off to see a movie and looking for a snack afterwards, well this place will work.

Several wait staff walked by us with any acknowledgement at all. Finally after 15 minutes or more my husband yelled to one of the fast walking waitresses if he could speak to a manager. He no sooner got the words out when our waitress showed up and apologized for the wait. We ordered our drinks and placed our order and waited another 20 minutes. We ordered the the seseme CD chicken strips and the fried greenbeans appetizers. The chicken was great but the greenbeans looked like they were from the bottom of the barrell. The fried coating was off most of them and just didnt have a good presentation.

77,Adam Y.,"Lowell, MA",0,6,2.0,1.0,2015-12-23,"it is a chain restaurant so what you expect a TGI Fridays to be is what you should expect and from previous visits it was. This visit was far from the same. Our server was non-existent, only even gave a descent tip because it was the holidays. Took about ten minutes from being seated until finally coming over for drink order. My wife ordered a coke and an order of mozzarella sticks and myself a beer on tap as well as a coke. We waited to order main dish, because like all chains the appetizer will come and two minutes later the main dish. This was a huge mistake. My wife's coke comes 10 minutes later but not mine, so at this time I just ask for a water. Five minutes later my beer arrives but no water. Guess no water or coke for me, at least my wife is driving for safety. 30 minutes after that we finally see our server again who says she will check on mozzarella sticks and to refill wifes coke. At this point it is obvious she forgot to put appetizer order in. So finally after an hour we have our appetizer and make main dish order which arrives 50 minutes later. The only time the server was attentive was when we were about to leave after being there for almost 2.5 hours, make a good last impression for a good tip! As for the food, well yeah? Obviously this location has taken cost cutting measures. The mozzerella stcks were at least hot and edible but definitely looked prefab. I ordered the Jack Daniels ribs and well the line order cook just didn't try, it looked like they threw them in a microwave and served them. My wife ordered a chicken cheese skillet thing and I was in awe of how unappetizing it looked. The cheese should be on top and not burnt and caked on the skillet. We ate what we could of the food and left. Still hungry we stopped at the BK drive through across the street. My wife and I have been to this location several times before as well as other TGI Fridays and have not been dissatisfied. The quality of service this time wouldn't keep us from coming back as I think this was an isolated incident, there was another server working her tail off. The food though has definitely gone downhill and will keep us from coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen?start=40,2.52,2.52,2.52,1.5080000000000002,2.52

Since the manager didn't come for a while I asked the hostess ok I'll pay for our drinks but we're leaving. Then the manager came and just stared at us after I explained abd he's like ok do you want desert? He sounded clueless without even being apologetic. 10 min later the food came.

After a couple of minutes, I went to the hostess and asked her for some, and she brought them within a few minutes.   The food: My husband's NY Strip was more medium well than medium rare, and the Jack Daniels dipping sauce was missing for the shrimp. I was served bourbon chicken instead of the bourbon mahi mahi because the server confessed he hit the wrong button when he placed the order. I thought I just had overlooked fish, when in fact it was dry chicken. My biggest regret is leaving any tip, even if it was only $5.00.  We stopped going to TGI Fridays in Danvers a few years ago because if horrific service, and that we now live closest to the Methuen location.  I think it's time to check out Red Robin at the Mall at Rockingham, or back to the Texas Roadhouse, where we've always had a delicious meal and excellent service.

Almost everyone was finished with their meals before we got our first refills on our drinks. When she delivered the drinks she started to walk away without taking the empty glasses or dishes. We had to ask her to clear the table, her response ""oh yeah I guess""  We finished our drinks, would have had another one but AGAIN couldn't find her, had to look for another waitress to get our bill. When she showed up with it finally, her apology was ""sorry I was talking"" I don't need the waitress to be at my table every 5 mins but I shouldn't have to get a different server to find you because you're not even in the area for an extended amount of time. When I can't find you for 30 minutes because you're talking in the kitchen, obviously the service industry is not for you.

49,Jared P.,"Dracut, MA",0,4,,1.0,2017-05-07,"HORRIBLE! This experience ranks in my top 5 worst eating experiences ever. It was actually so bad that I had to walk out before even getting my food. First, the potato skins that we ordered was not made the way that the menu says. The menu CLEARLY says that the the potato skins are topped with green onions. Absolutely no green onions. Ok, that is not a deal breaker as no one in my family cares for the green onions, but if you are going to advertise something then actually make it the way it was advertised. What really got on my nerves was that the bacon on it was still RAW. The slice of cheese (yes, slice, not shredded) wasn't even melted. I literally peeled off the cheese to show the waitress. So then came out drinks. Two of my children had order blue raspberry slushies. The drinks that they got was a blue drink with just 2 inches of crushed ice on the top. I slushie is supposed to be a frozen drink... the whole thing. It wasn't even blended, just a blue drink topped with crushed ice. The waitress tried to tell us it was because that it started melting. It should have been served to my children still completely full of frozen bits. We had gotten a chocolate milk for our daughter. They didn't even bother to stir it before bringing it out. There was just the chocolate sitting at the bottom. How freaking lazy are these people? I complained to the waitress about these things and she started getting nasty with me saying that I should not complain to her. Like WTF? Lady, are you stupid? This is your job. You are the middleman. When things are not done correctly I am not going to go and hunt down the 12 different people that screwed up the food and were too stoned to put in any effort. This is YOUR job. YOU are the person that I am supposed to complain too. I got out to eat between 15 to 25 times a week. I rarely ever have to complain about the food. But this was beyond pathetic. I did not want to even bother waiting for my meal because god knows that I was likely going to have to cook the steak myself. Hell, the last that I felt the need to directly complain about the food that was served to me was over 2 years ago. I won't go and complain about a single little thing, but when the food is not as advertised, comes out not cooked, and they are even screwing up the darn drinks then we have a big problem. This is the first time that I have been seated in a place and decided to walk out before getting my food. That says quite a lot right there. My wife and I ate here once about 2 years ago and we never came back. As we were waiting for our starter and drinks, we were questioning why we never did come back in the past 2 years. Well, I certainly know why now. I remember I used to love eating at this chain (different location though) over a decade ago. The service and food quality has gone down hill horribly. I believe part of the reason for this is now how they advertise endless appetizers. They have to make up for all the cost of people ordering so many appetizers that they decided to just make it as cheap as possible.

And I'm somebody who loves great customer service. Today I went in with my friend and my two kids for lunch. The server had horrible customer service skills. She never refilled our drinks for the hour and forty minutes we were there. I don't know if she just didn't like kids or our ethnicity (which happened to be hers too) but she was so rude to us and very friendly and talkative to the other two tables around us with no kids and different ethnicity. Prepare to wait for a while for your food here. The server forgot part of my order so it was ready after I ate half of my meal. She never asked us how was our food until after we had a conversation with her boss about something else. Anyways, avoid this place if you like good customer service. I have only been there for lunch and with kids so I don't know if that's the problem. They are plenty of options with much better customer service around",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002

We just had a table cleared, it'll be 5 more minutes"". 10 minutes later, we check in, and our table was given away by another host who apparently ""didn't know"" about the size change.

While we waited, I had the pleasure of staring at a picked-clean rib bone that was sitting on the floor in full view of the front door/lobby area where the host stand was. The host was nowhere to be seen, as it would turn out because they were short-handed and incapable of handling incoming customers. When we did get seated in the bar, with two 4-year-olds, our server was great, but that rib bone went unnnoticed our entire meal. I had to speak to the manager and point it out over an hour later before it was addressed.  The food at Friday's is always pretty good - I've always been a fan of their Sesame Jack Chicken strips - and their (alcoholic) drinks are always spot-on as well.

People should be able to trust the server with their debit cards, credit cards, OR a gift card. not to be used on someone else's bill.
