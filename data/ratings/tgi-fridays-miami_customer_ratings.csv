63,Vane V.,"Miami, FL",141,60,54.0,3.0,2012-02-05,So I had the pick 3 for $16.99 and it was alright. I picked a broccoli and cheese soup to start my meal and it was really good. Super tasty. Then I had the 10 oz sirloin steak with parmesan steak fries and mashed potatoes. The steak wasn't good at all but the parmesan fries were really good.  The best part was desert. I had the vanilla bean cheesecake which was fantastic. I actually want another slice. So yeah. Everything was really good except the steak.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami?start=100,1.9000000000000001,1.9000000000000001,1.9000000000000001,1.9000000000000001,1.9000000000000004
81,Daniel R.,"Miami, FL",35,144,71.0,4.0,2012-02-23,"Alright boys & Girls, I came here about a couple of weeks ago and I gave this place two stars, the main reason was that the food me and my friends ordered were bad and didn't live up to its expectations, plus the service took forever to get our orders and get our food out to us. So to be fair & unbiased - I gave them the benefit of the doubt like my favorite old saying ""every dog has its day"" that day wasn't theirs... So i got there around 2200 (10:00pm) met up a couple of friends... the server got there quick, and she was very attentive. The appetizer spinach dip was excellent freshly made, the tortillas didn't taste stale at all. My friends ordered half rack ribs, sirloin steak & half rack rib with fries, and i ordered of course the healthy petite USDA 6oz steak with asparagus (gotta watch my figure) ... the food came out perfect! Everything was cooked properly, nothing was stale as it was before and it actually tasted good. The bad side was that we ordered the brownie sundae thing for desert it was good but to find out there was 2 pieces of long hair melted inside the brownie (YUCKKKK)... but the manager apologized and got us another literally 2 minutes later... very good A+ BIG IMPROVEMENT!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami?start=120,1.936,1.936,1.936,1.936,1.936
57,Mandy L.,"West Miami, FL",275,89,47.0,4.0,2012-05-29,This rating is solely based on the bar during Happy Hour.  I will admit that I don't really like the food here. It's not that it's terrible. It's just nothing to write home about.  The babes and I used to come here often for the late night Happy Hour specials. Their Happy Hour ends at 7pm but begins again at 9pm until closing at 2am.  Sweet! The bartenders are down to earth and know their stuff! The service at the bar is always quick and friendly. It's always entertaining to watch them practicing juggling bottles. Most of the bartenders here will remember your drink of choice if you frequent the location. They're good like that!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami?start=80,1.936,1.936,1.936,1.936,1.936

Fridays is my usual no-fail restaurant...I have been to numerous locations across the U.S. so I know what to expect. I have favorites on the menu that never disappoint. However, this particular location wasn't the greatest. I had several problems with my order (no fault of my server, rather the kitchen) and the bathroom was horrid.  I understand Dolphin Mall serves a lot of people but they need their cleaning people to be in the bathroom round the clock...if that is where the kitchen staff is washing their hands....(yuck)! Food/experience was so-so. Could have been better. TGI is a chain so I would never complain about the overall menu items but my personal experience at their various locations and this particular one was less than stellar.  2.5 stars, generous enough to round to 3.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami?start=60,2.72,2.72,2.72,1.6760000000000002,2.72

I think anyone who has been to a chain like Chilli's or Applebee's pretty much gets an idea of what this place is like in terms of the menu.  My review is solely about the happy hour. This place, by far, has one of the best happy hours of all restaurant/bars. Well drinks are $2.50 (how can you beat that?).. and many of the appetizers are half off as well (including wings).  Normally when I go out for drinks I try and check out a new spot but lets face it.. sometimes you just want to go to a place that is safe and easy and requires minimal effort. This place does just that. I've come in many times with the guys to kick back a few and chill.

74,Ed-man H.,"Miami, FL",61,162,97.0,1.0,2013-07-01,"We came on a Saturday night around 7, and the place was pretty empty. We've been here plenty if times and its never been great, but ok. We came after the movies with the kids and we were seated right away, but it took our waiter a while to come over and great us. We placed our drink orders, appetizer and food order at the same time since we already knew what we wanted.  Our drinks took about 10 minutes, and the place wasn't even full. Our Main dish arrived and it was a mess. 1) Our appetizer didn't make it out 2) My salad didn't make it out either. 3) I tried the new chicken with tortellini, and the plate only comes with FOUR! How do I know, I was splitting it with my wife since we weren't that hungry after the movies. Â So she had two and I had two, and split the Chicken. Â 4) My sons' ribs were dry, overcooked, and barely any meat on them. I called the waiter over when our meal arrived and let him know my disappointment and our missing foods, he checked with the manager and the kitchen and told us yes, they gave our appetizer to another table, and he didn't know what happened to the salad. Â He didn't seem to concerned about trying to make it right or try and make us happy. Â They finally brought the appetizer (Mac&Cheese bits) when we were finished with our meal and it looked nothing like the picture in the menu. Â They were half the size and way over cooked and burned. Â  I was totally expecting the manager to come over and see how we were doing since they had multiple errors and were very dissatisfied with the meals and experience. Â He never made it over to our table, but the table next to us that had a young couple and a very pretty woman got all the attention. Â The manager and about 4 other servers were constantly walking up to their table, chatting with them, etc. Â  After he brought us our check, he removed the appetizer but had an extra drink charge on my check. Â I had to grab him and point it out so he could remove it. Â This place has never been special, but bearable. Â NEVER AGAIN!. Â I will no longer dine at this TGIFridays.

97,Sweets M.,"Miami, FL",1,8,2.0,1.0,2014-01-27,"I can say I had been a Friday's customer for well over 20 years if not more. I am a frequent rewards member and every month would get something with the amount of visits I had. However, this all changed since November.  My last two visits to Fridays have been nothing short of a disaster. Back in November I went with my family of four and our bill was close to 100. Anyone who eats at Fridays will assume that must have been one hearty meal. Well quite the opposite; the waiter was HORRIBLE, SLOW, and not very familiar with the menu and the deals. Our food was cold, delayed they brought everyones meal at a different time, we ordered drinks from the bar and they could not have been more watered down. We had no water for the kids. No manager came to see us and the kicker was when I went to get the point on my card the waiter said he forgot so for me to go online and add them. I left there and called the next day to speak to a manager. She apologized and offered to have us back and I said no because this has been happening quite often the last couple of times ive been to Fridays. Well when the New Year came we were out shopping and my girlfriend decided to eat at Fridays. I forewarned her but let my guard down to what would soon be again a disaster. The bar smelled like absolute Clorox, the waitress was more busy talking to friends than serving our table. The burgers were cold, the orders were wrong, the chicken tasted like rubber...Again money down the drain, and a bad stomach ache for my kids. and, of course no manager in sight...how odd! The next morning when I had spent all night up with my daughters I called and asked to speak with a district manager. The manager came on the phone and after I told her I had a complaint told me to call 1800Fridays. I did, they asked me to not write a comment in Yelp until I would speak with the district manager. That was the icing on the cake. The district manager called me to say that he apologized for my experience but the problem was they were under new management and not everyone was trained. He asked again if I would come back and I said no..after speaking for a while he said he would send me something in the mail for us to go to another Fridays. 3 weeks later and nothing came. I am not saying I would have used it, but clear example that service at TGI Fridays at Dolphin Mall is not what it iused to be. With so many better options like Mojitos, Cheesecake, Buffalo Wild Wings (where the chicken tastes real), Texas de Brasil do not choose Fridays. YOu will have bad service, cold food, watered down drinks and absolutely horrible follow up by management...Wake up people and read the reviews on Yelp!!!! I myself am guilty of not doing so and this paid the price twice..... They will blah blah blah and never take action on your loss of money, time and aggravation",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami?start=120,2.24,2.24,2.24,1.8600000000000003,2.24

When the food gets there, here is what to expect: Cold Food- the overlying theme in all 5 dishes was that they were cold, then placed under heat lamps so now they were warm on top and then stale underneath. Poorly Seasoned Food- the steak and ribs and chicken and turkey burger and cheeseburger all tasted the same and the same isn't even a ""good same"". The redeeming quality is that when the waitress/waiters do have time, they are usually very friendly and the drinks are still very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami?start=60,1.8,1.8,1.8,2.152,1.8000000000000003

The cheese was good and the Jack Daniels sauce had a nice smoky kick. The French dip sandwich mom got wasn't bad either and my dad's parmesan chicken with Mac and Cheese was good as well. But again it wasn't anything out of the ordinary.  Service wasn't bad either, our waitress was friendly and very sweet. She was quick and prompt and answered all of our questions.

12,Phillip H.,"Miami, FL",430,38,51.0,2.0,2016-06-01,"Date Night Log 601-001 It's Wednesday It's Endless Apps. It a hell of a good time to go to TGI Fridays. Oh yeah. Place is empty and you get seated. New specials are shown and boom we ask the question of questions. Are shellfish cooked on the same pan as everything else, being my wife has a shellfish allergy.  Boom hostess checks. No everything is cooked separately. Out comes the waitress. Offers us alcohol, I decline, offers again. This is where I start to have an issue. If I say No, then don't offer it again. I might be a recovering alcoholic, I may not want any, i may be poor. Either way let's move on.  Waitress comes back hey you ready to order. Boom we are undecided, so why not offer us the new shrimp and steak. Hold up the hostess didn't relay my wife has a shellfish allergy. I then smirked and said she can't have that unless she wants to die she's allergic to shellfish. Waitress is oh wow ok got it. We then order the 3 for all appetizer. (Fyi the mozzarella sticks are fried in the same fryer as shrimp) oh course the waitress doesn't think of that as we didn't know it was, so when we ordered it 1 minute after stating the fact my wife has allergies. We thought it was all cooked in separate friers like the steaks are in pans. Out comes the food, the food tasted amazing, the Pretzel with cheese sauce, the mozzarella sticks, and the Sriracha chicken. Oh yeah she like it spicy. We then get our entrees. I get the amazing chicken that's cooked on a board and my wife gets chicken pasta. The waitress asks us how's everything. We said good. My wife finished her alcoholic drink and the waitress insists of another. She declined but said are you sure. Again, I felt at that point I was at tootsies and not fridays. The manager came by and asked how was everything. Explained how my chicken is cooked and was amazing. Good person to have there. Actually both managers are good. Keep them. Then we finished our food, and now Diamond (Fyi that's not her name but at this point like I said I felt I was at tootsies so that would be a stage name) asked if we were ready for some Tennessee Whiskey Cake. Again I look around made sure I was at Fridays and maybe not on a prank show. I don't want alcoholic stuff. Boom we get the bill. Waitress explains about a survey. Wait hold up. Aren't you not suppose to talk about surveys and ask to give a high score. I'm only saying this bc in my job we can't do that.  After I pay, and start to think I realized why I am seeing such bad scores on yelp for this Fridays. That they have had issues and needed to get there scores up from what they have so they over do things.  Here comes the kicker. We leave walk to Hot Topic (yes a yelp for there will be coming soon) and my wife fells her throat funny. After 5 minutes boom allergic reaction we go back to Fridays she getting a reaction to shellfish. Remember those amazing string breaded cheese called mozzarella we ate earlier. Yeah boom allergic reaction. Cooked on the same fryer as breaded shrimp. Ambulance comes takes her away. The two managers I do have to say thank you for taking care of my wife, speaking to your waitress, and to the cooks about if any food was cross contaminated. Now not letting us know that everything is cooked separate besides fried foods was wrong on the hostess and waitress part. So if you have a shellfish allergy you can eat here. Just beware the tasty fries, mozzarella sticks.. you know what anything that is fried in a fryer.  Again the two managers get 5 stars. The place gets 2 because they didn't think of the safety of my wife when she explained twice of her allergies. This should be brought up in meetings and corporate setting.

We were all interested in ordering drinks, but one member of our party is in possession of an old vertically-oriented (portrait format for you MS Word users) under 21 ID. According to the employees there, it is company policy (we did not see it in writing) to swipe the under 21 IDs to verify the license holder's age. But if the magnetic strip is damaged, it will not register your age on the device and you will not receive your alcoholic drink, even when the date of birth printed on the license displays a date that is at least 21 years ago. We protested their refusal to serve one of our members a drink despite the clearly over 21 date of birth printed to no avail with two different managers. Three of us had already had the drinks brought over to us, but we told them we were refusing service, yet they still charged us for our drinks when were getting up to leave.  TGIF has one of the silliest policies I have ever heard of. They will never again get my hard earned money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami,1.84,2.0,2.0,1.7320000000000002,1.936

Unfortunately as we were ordering drinks my sister was told her ID needed to be swipe on a little machine they have to verified her age. She is over 21 but she has a vertical ID and the magnetic strip is faded. The first manager came, intended to swipe ID and said it will not work, we asked her to see her date of birth to verified ID and she said it was fine. We assumed my sister will be getting her drink as this is the first time they mentioned such policy, which by the way is not in the entrance, neither drink menu. As I got my drink and my boyfriend, we asked what about her drink to our server and he mentioned he couldn't serve her the drink. We asked to see the manager and another manager came with the machine, intending to swipe the ID again. As we explained her the other manager had tried to do it and since ID is faded on the back she left not saying anything about my sister not able to get the drink. We would it have left right there, however after asking our server on her drink status he bought another manager and this manager said they base on policy need to be able to verified ID. We asked what is the machine supposed to said and she said the age. So we asked her to verified date of birth on ID which clearly states her age but she insisted the machine needed to verify it. So I asked her why is her policy no stated in the door for users to be aware before they even consider going in. She had nothing to say, we requested the bill and she mentioned we still needed to pay for the other drinks that were bought to the table, even though we didnt touch them. I think it is ridiculous they don't have this policy listed on their door, i would not have wasted 30 minutes of my Saturday otherwise.

Today I tried to use a coupon and my co-worker bought an endless app and the manager did not want to honor it because it could not be used with the endless offer and I said I could understand .. Then I asked her to separate the tickets and she refused. I was very annoyed by her lack of professionalism and her face when she told us that she could not. At the end she honor it because she could not say no to the separation of the tickets. Each customer buys what they like and if you can not give a good service as a manager then you should not damage a good business as it is TGFriday... Â  You should study to become a manager, it is obvious that you came to that position not for studies or knowledge because you lack professionalism.

At first the hostess said the wait would be 45 minutes for a table and we were about to leave when the manager (a young lady, blonde) stopped us and found a table. The waiter was very efficient. Water glasses filled quickly and he manged to bring the orders out as we requested (kids' meals first).  Despite being a peak time there was no delay in the service and the staff was very friendly and professional.

She took It and came back saying ""if you look at the middle of the steak it's slightly pink, you can look for yourself if you want"" lol what?! First off medium is not slightly pink, it's pink. Secondly It wasn't even pink It was brown in the middle which should be the least cooked part. Thirdly instead of coming back with the food that was clearly prepared wrong and pretty much being like too bad that's what you get think about proper service. Ive worked at restaurants before and I get it's a mistake but It was handled poorly. The chef ended up asking if I was willing to wait for another steak or if I wanted to order something else but by that time my family was almost done with their plates and we had somewhere to be so I went without eating.
