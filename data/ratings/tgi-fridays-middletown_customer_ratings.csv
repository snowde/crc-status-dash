She had our orders customized to our liking, gave good recommendations, was attentive during our whole visit, and very pleasant in general. The food was good, the place seemed clean. It wasn't crowded, as it wasn't quite diner time yet.  The cons:  Some of the other employees were having conversations and making comments that they probably should have kept to themselves. The bartender could be heard complaining that he was on his last bottle of a particular ingredient and would refuse to make any drinks that called for it once it ran out. My friend saw two other employees making out, and we saw them later being very flirtatious and touchy with each other. Not what I want to see when I go out to eat. Or to any place of business, for that matter. Perhaps the staff could use some training...

37,Don W.,"Fairport, NY",0,8,,2.0,2016-07-16,"We were not very impressed by our experience at this TGI Friday's restaurant.  We were staying at a hotel located close by and walked over for dinner on a Thursday evening, well after the dinner rush was over.  The restaurant was mostly empty, with only a couple other groups of customers.  Surprisingly, we were seated at a table right next to the kitchen, even though there were many tables and booths open in quieter areas of the room.   Our server then came to take our drink order, but was not familiar with their draft beer selection and had to refer us to the printed menu.  We ordered two draft beers from the menu.  After a couple minutes, our server returned to inform us that the beer that my wife had ordered was not available.  That's fine, she then ordered a different beer.  Then a couple more minutes later the server returned again and said that my beer choice also was not available.  In my experience, many customers at TGI Friday's order beer with dinner, so one would expect that the server would be familiar with the beer menu.  One would also expect that the bar staff would keep the servers informed about which products are not available.   The food itself was fine, typical for what one would expect from a TGI Friday's.  I am sure that this restaurant gets a lot of business from customers staying at the close by hotels, so maybe the management does not really care if they get any repeat business.  However, we do care about things like customer service, and we won't return to this TGI Friday's location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-middletown?start=20,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2

I received an email promo code for 20% off an online to-go order, so I downloaded their mobile app for my iPhone to view the menu and place the order. The menu on the app glitched out and wouldn't show me the menu items within the categories. So then I just went to their regular website - but I noticed that they weren't offering those Jack Daniels Chicken Strips - what I remember to be an awesome signature item! But on the website, they had a local menu pdf available, and it was listed there. So I wondered why I couldn't order the JD Chicken Strips or JD Sampler online, and that I had to phone the order in. Because I had to phone the order in, I wasn't able to take advantage of the 20% off online to-go order promo code they emailed me. Oh well - it was only a couple bucks savings anyways. So I phoned-in my order for a JD Sampler, Sizzling Chicken & Shrimp, and a large coke. The girl on the phone said it would be 10-15 minutes. I arrived 15 minutes later at around 10pm, and it took another 25 minutes for my food to come out. I checked in the bag right there, and the food was very cold. It seemed as though my food just sat getting cold while I waited for it. No utensils or napkins in the bag. For $37.00 I would've hoped for at least my food to be hot when it came out. And I was charged $2.89 for a small 6oz to-go cup of soda? It was very disorganized, and the bartender wasn't helpful at all.

Bar was empty.  This was s Friday night after 6. No wonder it was empty. We are taking 7 months or so off from this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-middletown,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
34,Eli N.,"Middletown, NY",24,12,1.0,2.0,2017-04-12,My first visit to TGI Fridays here in Middletown and can I say boy it was just awful. Of course the company always makes for a good time but I can't say the same for the service. We walk into this establishment and it was no where near busy but somehow we still had to wait to be seated. So as my comrades and I wait for a waitress we notice the seat we got were unusually low. I'm sure it's not the restaurants fault that the waitress took extremely long to serve us. It becomes even more of a situation because my friend was in a rush to get home. What I honestly feel like in any restaurant is that the waiter/waitress should check on their clients as much as possible to see if they need any help. I'm sure a sloth could've served us faster. At the end she messes up our receipt charging us way more than what we needed to pay. If you're wondering about the taste of the food it was bleh point blank period. It honestly wasn't that great probably last time I go there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-middletown?start=20,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
10,Joseph C.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,45,9.0,1.0,2017-04-23,I went to this place before and was somewhat pleased. I went with family last night 4-22-17. Service was terrible. I am not sure what the problem was but a family of 4 getting their food at different times is not acceptable. I can see if it was a minor two apart but it was literally 15 mins apart. Mine didn't even come out until the rest of my family was finished eating!!!  I ended up cancelling my portion of the order...Please save yourself the trouble dont bother going if you want to eat together as a family...... I think the only decent kiss up reviews this place has is from staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-middletown,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04

4,Charity D.,"Weiden, Germany",80,52,230.0,5.0,2017-05-12,Came here with a girlfriend for lunch today and had a very lovely experience! Our waiter and waitress were extremely friendly and seemed to pay extra attention if we were okay or needed anything. I ordered the new coconut water boba drink with the mango!! Yummy!! You must seriously try this every mango boba was an added burst of yumminess!! For lunch we both ordered the same thing garlic chicken and shrimp but instead of the mashed potatoes we got the Jasmine rice pilaf! This dish was seriously so delicious. The aroma matched the taste to perfection. The manager came out and asked us if everything was to our liking and we told her indeed everything was! One thing I'd say I love about TGI FRIDAYS is they have certain dishes where you can have the option to make gluten free which was perfect because my friend does not eat gluten! So that was an added plus! From the staff to the decor to the food definitely 5 stars! I did not have 1 complaint. Also they do have a rewards program so if you are not a part of it sign up to earn points towards future visits!! I will 100% be back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-middletown,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
15,Kevin M.,"Florida, NY",1,3,,1.0,2017-05-14,"4 of us are sitting at the bar right now.  We have been here for half an hour and there were 9 open tables in the bar room.  We were told there was a half hour wait for a table.  There are currently still 6 open tables in the bar room. There doesn't appear to be anymore people waiting, I don't really understand why they couldn't seat us.  The food is mediocre anyway, so I will not be coming back to this place. This is just ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-middletown,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08

8,Tasha M.,"Middletown, NY",27,3,,1.0,2017-07-20,Attempted to eat at Fridays and waited 20 minutes without a server coming to the table to even speak to us. Several servers passed our table and huddled together for discussion but none addressed us.  As we got up to leave - the manager approached the table and asked us to stay but did not offer any incentive to do so.  We will not be going back to Fridays!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-middletown,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88
14,K D.,"Maybrook, NY",0,2,,2.0,2017-09-05,"The food at this location is good, but unfortunately the service is poor. I ordered salmon, with an add-on of shrimp to go. The shrimp was missing from my order although I was charged for it. The manager was unapologetic for the oversight and said it could take up to 7 days to refund my card.

2,Sasha D.,"Middletown, NY",42,64,6.0,1.0,2017-09-17,"Occasionally come here to watch a game. Food used to be average chain food, fried salty bad for you tastiness, but whoa, really going downhill. Preformed frozen burgers purchased in bulk from Sam's, cooked to a dull brownish grey, cheap tinny spaghetti sauce poured over shrimp and bland chicken with even blander cheese. Completely missing the mark. I'd get a fresher burger at Five Guys for a third of the price. Pleasant but very inexperienced wait staff. Forgot pretty much everything we needed to dine with, couldn't work tv to find games. At least the water was good...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-middletown,1.8,1.8,1.8,,1.8000000000000003
0,Lorie R.,"Ellenville, NY",29,14,,4.0,2017-09-28,"Had a previous bad experience at this location and decided to try again. Went there with my hubby during the week during the afternoon. Quiet with a few other customers. We sat in the bar area. Was seated right away and the waiter/bartender Jose came right over to serve us. He answered all of our questions about the menu and even explained the reward system to us. (had a coupon for a free meal due to our rewards). He was very polite, friendly and couteous and attentive. The food was warm not hot but was excellent. A very plensent afternoon. I recommend that you ask for Jose. Stand up guy, excellent at his job. Well done Jose.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-middletown,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
3,V S.,"Stony Point, NY",0,1,,1.0,2017-10-14,"TGI Friday is not what it used to be.  They have changed the ingredients to their dishes.  Doesn't make them taste better.  They should have kept their old menu.  Their salads are skimpy. Appetizers are not great either.  To top it all, the service is horrible.  Lost me as a customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-middletown,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
6,Jill J.,"Middletown, NY",0,6,,1.0,2017-11-07,"this place is the worst both on service and food and ive given this place a few chances.    last experience, we were told a 15 min wait which ended up being 45 min ( they are known for lying about the wait time)      when we finally sat, i asked the server a question who proceeded to yawn in my face and replied ""uh yea""   we ordered chips as an app that never came until a half hour later.  after  an hour of waiting for our food,  we were given comped chips.   just to give you an idea of how long we were waiting, we were given 4 more comed chips before our food came.     watched the cook come back from the bar with a beer and spit on the floor right by the table before waltzing back into the kitchen  the food was gross, obviously sitting under the heat lamps and our server disappeared,    the childrens meals were on fire and could have burned them if i didnt grab them first.     the manager came without being asked.  she obviously knew that the entire experience was awful and offered a discount of a whopping 10%         just stay away",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-middletown,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003
13,Alison F.,"Pine Bush, NY",0,2,,1.0,2017-11-11,"I had made a reservation at this restaurant for 9 people at 8:15 PM using the online service, OpenTable, and received an email confirming my reservation. Upon arrival, after being greeted by arguing waiters, we were rudely told by the staff that their iPad was broken and they had never received our reservation. I am very upset about this since we had planned this dinner to be a birthday celebration for a visiting family member and being a Saturday night, unable to get our large party into any of the surrounding restaurants with less than an hour wait. We had the sense to make this reservation knowing that our party was rather large but the staff at this restaurant didn't have the sense to apologize or disable reservations to be made on OpenTable. I am very disappointed in the unprofessional way that this was handled by the staff. From now on, I will think twice before returning to this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-middletown,1.8,1.8,1.8,,1.8000000000000003
