Well we didn't have to wait to be seated (nice) and it has been remodeled also (looked good). We all ordered our drinks and were trying to figure out what to eat so many choices. I got the salmon and shrimp my wife got the steak and ribs so many other things I wanted also,so that was the best we could. When the food arrived it looked scrumptious,I will have to say everything was outstanding. Our waitress was also outstanding our glasses never went empty and didn't even have to ask for a to go box. We couldn't resist the desert menu.had to order chocolate and peanutbutter pie oh out of this world. I will have to say I was suprised that we had such a wonderful time and lunch,will have to go back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-midlothian-2?start=20,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997

22,Lauren B.,"Richmond, VA",241,311,1087.0,2.0,2012-07-25,"For a chain restaurant, I expected a lot better. The food to me is nothing speical and the atmospher is a typical TGI Friday's. The ""adult"" drinks were rather watery and I felt I overpaid for them. My meal was okay, I was not a fan of the steak- as it was not cooked as I had requested. I have never come to this place where I have not had to wait - and the service was not with a smile.

19,Arthur F.,"Chesterfield, VA",48,228,350.0,3.0,2013-03-09,"We visited this location of TGI Friday's for the first time in over a year, largely on account of the fact we received coupons in the mail recently. Upon entering we saw a place that was bustling with customers. We were seated promptly and the gentleman that seated us, also made sure we had drinks. After waiting for a bit of time, I stopped a waiter and asked who was serving our table. He went to the front and after another few minutes our server appeared for one of the few times during our meal.  My son had the mac & cheese. We weren't asked about the side for him and I forgot to mention anything. My wife ordered the ribs with coleslaw and French fries, while I opted for the Chipotle Yucatan Chicken Salad.  With the exception of the French fries, which were served warm, limp and strangely dry, the meal was passable. The ribs were juicy but based on the color, taste combination weren't really smoked in spite of the taste. The Jack Daniels sauce served on and as a side to the ribs was serviceable, but not house rocking. As for the salad, it was served with chicken, avocados and tostados as the primary ingredients. It was satisfactory, but little more.  If we had paid face value on the meal, it may have been difficult to justify three stars. However, at 29 dollars for the three of us, which is comparable to an outing to a coffee/sandwich establishment, it is a 3 star meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-midlothian-2,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508
18,Jon B.,"Richmond, VA",185,220,192.0,4.0,2013-08-07,"Granted, Fridays is an upscale version of Applebees, this particular location makes the Midlothian Turnpike location look like a joke. I arrived there on a Saturday evening when the parking lot was pretty full outside. Upon entering the restaurant I was seated immediately. Without further delay, here is the review. The Good: Speedy Service- For a crowded restaurant, my order was brought out to me in less than 15 minutes. Food was hot on arrival.  The Bad: The Server- She did not do bad, but she disappeared for long periods of time when I needed a refill on my drink. Overall- This is a short review because the food was decent but far from gourmet. I would dine anywhere in this part of town versus Short Pump any day of the week.

28,Denise L.,"Pickerington, OH",11,146,19.0,3.0,2013-12-13,We have not been to a Fridays in years but needed something to eat after a long drive into town for a wedding.  First impression loud and crowded.  It felt very cramped compared to similar restaurants like Ruby Tuesdays or Max and Ermas in Ohio. Staff was nice and food was good.  The new pretzel sticks were excellent.  Husband liked his BBQ chicken flatbread and my chicken sandwich was good.   The only annoying thing was the manager had to approve a 15% off coupon we had from the hotel.  The hotel keys were printed with the Fridays address so you think as a local promotion that the waiter would just apply it.  The manager didn't have the time to address it so it took a few extra minutes to get it approved. We may or may not go there again if we were back in town.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-midlothian-2?start=20,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38

Waitress, Lakyn, was not overly attentive.  But whoever sat behind us was well known to wait staff as many went over to visit and sit with them. Our waitress refilled their water glasses as ours sat empty.  She visited their table numerous times.  Her tip will reflect her service.  We've been here before and this is first time service wasn't up to par. We've earned enough points for a free meal.  Meals were good though not overly hot.  Could be because server who attempted to serve it delivered to wrong table and took it back to kitchen before coming back out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-midlothian-2?start=20,,,,,

The host was nice and placed us in the back at a very shaky table.  The waitress was nice and attentive, but we were the only table.  The food arrived promptly, we ordered the French onion soup, very good. However my husband was given a dirty soup, which was replaced.   Halfway thru they sat 2 more tabled directly beside us, which seemed odd... Why not spread out the tables, but no 3 right on top of each other.   Also the music came on all of a sudden very loud, and by the 3rd song I need to ask to turn down. I got the Thai taco, these were okay, weird consistency on the taco shell, but the filling was tasty.  Hamburger was  ok.  Overall a 3.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-midlothian-2,,,,,

25,Kemyt T.,"Chesterfield, VA",1,10,1.0,1.0,2014-11-23,"Now I remember why I haven been to a Friday's in over 10 years. My husband & I decided to eat here a few weeks back to take advantage of the $10 endless appetizer special. I knew it was a bad idea to come to Friday's as soon as we were seated. Every other booth/table in the restaurant had an infant or child under the age of three seated at it. Had we known this was the local infant hangout we would have gone somewhere more ""adult"". Another couple with a newborn was seated at a booth right across with us at the same time. Fifteen minutes after being seated our waiter(& his trainee) finally showed up to get our drink order. Another fifteen minutes later he returned to ""verify"" our drink order. Ten minutes later he finally brought our drinks and to take our order. Right after taking our order, the family seated across from us was already getting their meals (why wouldn't they... we had both already been seated for over 30 minutes). I ordered the endless $10 potato skin apps and soup and my husband ordered a steak and shrimp dinner. After about 20 minutes I finally received my super greasy deep fried potato skins. Yuck! Had I known they were going to be deep fried I wouldn't have ordered them... who deep fries potato skins?!?! They were greasy and dry and inedible. After 20 minutes of forcing down the skins the waiter graciously brought us another order of deep fried skins. Ugh! Meantime the family across from us was finished eating and left! After waiting another 20 minutes after receiving our second round of deep fried skins( mostly uneaten) the waiter came back to check on us. We asked where our meals were and the waiter proceeded to tell us that they ""don't even start cooking our meals until we are finished with our appetizers"". Really?!?! Had I known that I would skipped the apps!! If you are keeping count we have been at Friday's now for over 90 minutes and still haven't received our meals. FINALLY (20 minutes later) we received our meals. My soup was room temperature and my husbands meal was slightly warmer with the exception of his Mac & cheese which was actually hot. After we choked down our meals we had to wait at least 20 minutes before our waiter came back to check on us. We finally got our check, paid & ran out of there vowing to never return to this infant filled, poor service and fried food filled restaurant. Again, now I remember why it's been 10 years since I stepped foot in a Friday's. Never again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-midlothian-2?start=20,,,,,

We sat at the bar tables and made it clear to the waitress we wanted finger foods. She had no suggestions and we ordered burghers.  My burger fell apart and lack of flavor. We then realized that by sitting at the bar they had appetizer specials .... The waitress missed to mention what we were looking for.

One star is for the upgrade menu options. Glad there are some things not fried available.  No stars for service. Negative stars for management.  Our waitress clearly didn't want to be there. After inconveniencing her to take our order she disappeared. My salad came with a dollop of dressing so I asked for some more. Getting it myself would have been easier that pleading with the waitress to bring more dressing. Maybe she was making the vinaigrette herself.

After sitting with our toddler on our lap trying to feed her and eat ourselves (cause it was a Saturday at 6pm and multiple families with young children were there), the manager had the audacity to offer us a free appetizer - that means we would have to return.  Me thinks not.   Seriously, spend the money you would have used on all these ""free appetizers"" and buy some more high chairs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-midlothian-2?start=20,,,,,

A little biased with this review because 1) I've been going to this location for as long as I can remember and I consider it ""home"" compared to the other Friday's, and 2) we had a friend as our waiter, so obviously there were no service issues. The food is average, but the remodeled decor is a definite improvement! Karaoke night was cringeworthy, not necessarily because of the singers, but because there weren't a lot of people there and it was mainly an older *hopefully drunk* crowd.
