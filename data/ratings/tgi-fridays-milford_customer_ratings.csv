21,Drew N.,"Worcester, MA",22,147,432.0,2.0,2012-02-23,During my last visit I ordered the 2 for $10 special and chose the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and the pot stickers. The pot stickers were fantastic but when my entree came out the plastic solo cup with the sauce had melted into the food and everything looked like it had been sitting under the heat lamp for 20 minutes. I will give them credit for taking care of the problem and making it right but I was disappointed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-milford?start=60,1.8,1.8,1.8,1.8,1.8000000000000003

If I had gotten my food order taken, I would have been forced to eat your terrible food. If I would have eaten your terrible food, I probably would not have had the awesome duck at the Thai restaurant down the street. You are awful and made the cute bartender and the nice, older bartender look bad. I hope they quit just to get away from your miserable face. Thank you for making me find the Thai restaurant.

73,Ana R.,"Clinton, MA",167,507,103.0,2.0,2014-03-14,"My boyfriend and I were in the middle of a huge move, and when we stopped at the Milford Target for the usual move-specific needs (i.e. new plunger), we realized we hadn't eaten all day. Although we wanted to get take-out and go home, we were too tired to lift Styrofoam boxes, so we decided to eat in at TGI Friday's, the only non-drive-thru ""restaurant"" we could find in the immediate area.  I had fond memories of eating at TGI Friday's (at the Solomon Pond Mall) while I was in high school. Hanging out, milking the free soda refills and splurging on fried mozzarella sticks. My boyfriend had never been to one, so I thought it was a good enough reason to stop at Friday's and get a burger.  I was very surprised to see that gone was the ""flare"" and the striped uniforms and the bright colors of the TGI Friday's of my memory. The Friday's of today have a more sophisticated neutral atmosphere, with modern styling. They are comfortable, though a little less charming, but that may be nostalgia speaking.  The place was dead. This was a Friday night, so you'd think for this area, it would be a busy go-to restaurant for teens or families. We were seated right away, and I ordered the special sangria and a glass of water. My boyfriend had a coke. We got our drinks, minus the water, which I asked for again when we put in our appetizer, and again when we ordered our entrees... Finally, after I got my meal, I got my glass of water.  My boyfriend had one of those stacked Philly burgers. It's not a cheese-steak burger, it's a burger with lots of stuff on it. He was very happy with it. I Had the 6oz steak, with mashed potatoes and the tomato mozzarella salad. My steak and mashed potatoes were delicious. The salad was not great - lots of tomatoes and only a few little bits of mozzarella - and was really cold, not fresh cold, frozen cold. My sangria was ok, very very sweet, and not worth the mind-blowing $11 price tag.  We had no room for dessert. The service was not great. Our waitress kept telling us they were really backed up and it was an unusually busy night, but the restaurant was not even half full.  I was surprised at the huge gap between the quality of the service and the quality of the food. Though my salad was meh, my steak was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were really yummy. Had I checked this location's Yelp rating before going in, I would never have gone. And though I likely won't go again, seeing as I just moved out of the area, the food was ok, and I wasn't looking for a great restaurant experience, I was looking for food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-milford?start=40,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001

There was just a piece of hard plastic in my soup for $7.... Chunks of broccoli with fake cheese. There's like no point in going to a restaurant to pay for fake food. Everything this restaurant cooks is frozen or pre-made beforehand. Bartender and manager took my soup off of my bill but I'm still not satisfied. TGIF used to be so good. I'm so disappointed. I'm not usually this picky and I don't like to complain, but I can't eat plastic... So, I ordered a salad... It was okay cuz I was hungry. Burnt microwaved bacon in my salad. Gross! TGIF is going to go down hill don't you think? And it made it awkward between me and the friendly bartender who likes me. When the bartender took soup off, wasn't the manager supposed to come out to apologise? Isn't that what restaurants are supposed to do?! They didn't. He just gave the 'A OK' to take it off my bill. Not impressed.  While I'm already on a roll, let me make another complaint. My wine glass was dirty; sticky! And where I was sitting, it wasn't cleaned up. Food all over the counter.  I never ever complain but that's so gross and this has been the worst experience I've ever had at a TGIF!!

80,Michael D.,"Ashland, MA",3,27,,5.0,2014-08-07,"I am pretty easy to please and I take a restaurant for what it is. TGI Fridays isn't The Capital Grill nor should you expect it to be.  I had not been to a Fridays in almost 10 years and my last experience wasn't a good one. When my wife suggested we go to one I wasn't thrilled. When we walked in it didn't look like the Fridays I remembered. It was a new, better decor. There wasn't that corny bric-a-brac on the walls they use to have. So tacky! The place looked spotless and it was crowded. However, we got a table in less than 5 minutes!  The waitress Shari came over quickly to take our drink order and tell us about the specials. Our drinks arrived in a minute or 2 and we ordered our meal with help from Shari. Shari was very helpful, polite with an outstanding  customer service attitude!  My wife's salad arrived but had some cheese on it and she hates that. She will eat pizza or grilled cheese sandwiches but not cheese on any salad. Crazy huh? But she is a great wife so I have that going for me.....which is nice.   Anyway, she brought it to Shari attention. Shari apologized profusely and offered to bring a new salad.  My wife told her to forget it and it was fine. A few moments later the Manager, Gene, came over and asked about the problem. My wife told him there wasn't a problem and thanked him for his concern.  We could tell he was interested in our satisfaction. In this day and age a business cares about its customers?? Amazing. On to the food; the appetizer was DELICIOUS! Boneless wings perfectly seasoned, crunchy and delicious! Our meals, both chicken (but prepared differently) salads, were AMAZING! I was shocked I was in a Fridays. The drinks are reasonably priced and generous. Not like some restaurants that put their drinks in a thimble and charge $15 a drink!   This is the Fridays I remember from the 90's!

I was shocked she was even approaching me and replied saying ""no.""

They have higher standards and in general, just better customer service.  They allow more than one coupon, the restaurant is renovated, and Julia, one of the waitresses is SO friendly, kind, funny, and just the BEST. I always look forward to coming here over other locations (Mansfield especially). The food is great, and everything is always consistent and accurate. The rewards program is just outstanding and effects in coupons and offers for free things on a weekly basis. And above all, this TGI Fridays has been recently undergone a complete makeover into ""Friday's"". Super clean, well kept and they run a tight and organized ship! Management is friendly and whenever I call them it's always for a compliment; whenever calling the Mansfield location it's always a complaint.  Highly suggested. 5 stars.  I also HIGHLY SUGGEST joining the stripes program. For every $1 spent you get one stripe point. You can earn free burgers, desserts, coupons, and other stuff. Also, DO NOT throw out your receipt, and MAKE SURE to remember to take it. There is a survey for a free dessert / appetizer (up to $8), and if you buy a burger there is a JumpBurger code, go online to  , type in your code and send the free burger to your friends or someone else.

But im only updating this because of the main courses. I had a steak, asked for medium rare got it medium well. the rice and mash taht came with it were good though). My wife had a parmesan crusted chicken with tomato salad. The salad was nasty, old tomatoes and 5 little pieces of mozzarela dont make a salad, and her chicken is the very reason why im updating this: it was the nastiest piece of chicken ive ever had in my entire life. It wasn`t undercooked or anything like that but the taste tho.. It wasnt parmesan and the chiken tasted like they took it out of the freezer, left it out for 24 hours, put it back in, and then deforsted it to make that nasty crap.

74,Robert O.,"Uxbridge, MA",0,4,3.0,2.0,2016-04-09,"I have to say, TGI Fridays has not always been my ""go-to"" restaurant, but I always keep my hopes up. This time my hopes were too high. When I first walked in, I got that great aroma of delicious food! They had great music, and the Celtics on every TV! The decor was great, (like always), with the outstanding paintings and beautiful wall design! The waiters were very nice, and not so short staffed (great for me!). But, our waiter took about 20-25 minutes just to take our drink orders. I had Dr. Pepper, which was very warm for some reason. When the server came over to take our food order, I told him the Baby Back Ribs. Since I'm allergic to eggs, milk, and nuts, I asked the waiter to check for any of those in the sauce. He brought back an allergen menu (menu explaining types of allergies in the food) and told me they were out of ribs. So, I ordered a house salad with oil and vinegar dressing. He told me that he would make sure that there were no crossovers with any of my allergies. Again, it took WAY too long for a salad. 30 minutes?! Are you kidding me?! I eventually got my meal only to find it containing not just croutons (which had milk), but BOTH mozzarella and cheddar cheese, right in the middle!! I flagged the waiter down and told him they put cheese on it. He took it back and had a new salad made for me. I got the second salad, and it still had croutons, which I gave to my brother. The overall meal was ""ehh"". The grilled chicken on top was good, but it had a little too much fat, giving it a rubbery texture. The iceberg lettuce was very crisp and cold (the way I like it!). When I got the check, I was expecting my salad to be free, because of the mix-up with the cheese. Nope. FULL COST. Also, the waiter never had the manager or the cook come to my table and give a polite, sincere apology! To get back at them, I left no tip. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves being screwed over. One things for certain, I will NEVER go to TGI Fridays ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-milford?start=40,2.32,2.32,2.32,1.736,2.32

9,Michael S.,"Los Angeles, CA",91,8,1.0,3.0,2016-09-25,"So here's the deal. I'm not here to review the food. We don't go to places like TGIF because of the ""amazing cuisine"" or atmosphere. We go because the food is safe and consistently good. It's not going to set the world ablaze - you know what you're in for. Sometimes you want 5-star high end dining. Other times you want a quick gut-bomb. Then there's days where you just need a bit of fuel without destroying your stomach or your palette.  I'm happy to say, this TGIF delivered. I can also so the waiting staff delivered. They were very sweet and Johnny-on-the-Spot with drink refills. You're probably thinking, ""so what's with the 1-star ya jerk?!"" The 1-star is for the chefs/cooks/etc.  My co-worker and I have to be at a meeting a few minutes away by 12:00pm. We're looking for a place to eat and she's never been to a TGIF. I tell her, ya gotta go - that it's consistently good food. (If you can stomach places like Olive Garden, Applebees, Outback or Chili's, then this place is right on point.) She agrees so we pull in. It's 11am, we walk up and the doors are locked. No biggie, the hostess was apologetic and let us in. I mention that to illustrate we are the *only* customers. By 11:04am, we have our drinks served and order in - I have a grilled chicken breadth and my co-worker has some sorta quesadilla situation. We sit back, converse, discuss our meeting and make awkward glances at the bartender is belting out songs like she's Adele (read: she's not). We chuckle and go back to business. Waitress comes back and refills our drinks. All is right with the world.  As we're serenaded by Adele-lite, I notice the kitchen staff playing a bit of grab-ass I. The kitchen. It's 11:20 so I figure food should be close. 11:25 we get another refill and the waitress tells us the kitchen staff is almost done. I'm thinking, duh, it's been 21 minutes for a tortilla and chicken. 11:30 hits and Adele is still kickin' ass at the bar tossing bottles in the air Tom Cruise style ala Cocktail. There's still nobody else in restaurant ordering food or drinks but I can't hate on Adele for keeping her game tight.  11:35 and our waitress comes back out to tell us, ""My kitchen staff is still catching up."" I'm thinking, ""On what - sleep?!"" Like I mentioned, our waitress was on point. I felt bad. She was doing her best and getting completely effed by the kitchen staff. I can't imagine having to walk over to your customers in an empty restaurant and having to lie just to cover for your inept kitchen staff. I really felt for her.  11:45 and I see kitchen-grab-ass continuing. I also see the second customers of the day arrive. I want to warn them off, but I don't want the waiting staff to get gipped (or is it jipped?!) out of tips. 11:49 and our food finally arrives a full 45 minutes after order it. Now, we have a meeting at 12:00pm. We're from out of town and our next hotel is 4 hours away. I'm. It carrying chicken breast and quesadillas in our car for 4 hours *after* our meeting. We absorb what we can and Hoover it down - cramps be damned.  We pay, run out the door, and race to the meeting. I vow to write a crummy review as I was completely disappointed. My co-worker forgot the dang receipt so here I am on Yelp rather than doing the ""performance review"" from the receipt code.  You might be thinking, ""Dude, you arrived at opening. Of course it took longer. They need to warm stuff up, thaw food out, etc."" I get that - but if it takes 30 minutes to prep the kitchen, then either open at 11:30 or get to work at 10:30. To the manager of this TGIF, you need to get back there and crack some heads. If you have extra scratch, maybe some singing lessons for Adele-lite. Her heart is in it, her voice isn't. Anyway, I hope every else's visit is better than mine. I'm not that guy who wets out to write bad reviews. ""But dude, you just did!"" Well, I'm hoping it might do some good. That's all from me. I'm heading to Cracker Barrel. Enjoy your meal! EDIT - The food was on par as well as the service.  The kitchen staff were asleep at the wheel.  The manager has acknowledged so I've bumped it up to three stars.  If the kitchen staff were on the ball, it'd be 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-milford,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.9640000000000002,2.0
46,Lee F.,"Easthampton, MA",0,3,,2.0,2016-10-07,"Really disappointed. I'm easy to please, not high maintenance at all, but this experience was so poor I am actually taking the time to write a review. We got here early on a Friday night. No wait, place was only about half full and got seated right away. So far so good.  My expectations for a Friday's are low. We just wanted a relatively quick, decent meal before getting back on the road. We waited nearly 20 minutes before anyone even made eye contact with us after being seated. Usually at least someone will come over and offer water or something. Jeez. So far, service stinks and I'm so hungry I'm about to get up and head to Wendy's instead. We get our menus (still no water ever offered after we've been sitting here ignored for nearly 30 minutes) and then have to wait another 15 min before she comes back to take our order. I can understand if it's slamming here but it's not. There are empty tables still and tables that have been vacated with old food sitting on them still for 10 minutes.  You can see when the rest of this review is going so no need to perseverate on the obvious. It took forever, wasn't worth it, and I'm terribly disappointed that our quick and easy meal turned into us basically chasing our waitstaff around to do her job. The food came out cold and one plate at a time. Food quality (aside from the temperature) was decent but not great. My burger was underdone and my fries were so salty I'm still thirsty 3 hrs and about a gallon of water later.  Also, the bathroom was gross and there was a big chunk of hair in the sink. Obviously, I will not be back. This was the first time I've been to a Fridays in about 5 years and I can safely say it will be at least another 5 before I go back.

My sister manages a restaurant and I've even worked for This establishment when they first opened in milford. Everything about our lunch was unacceptable. It took forever for someone to even come to our table, once they did they didn't even introduce themselves when she came to our table. We ordered our drinks and apps. Again the drinks probably took a good 15 minutes to come and only 4 out of the six came. Our apps took forever as well, by time they we needed new drinks which the manager ended up getting because the waitress was ""in the weeds"" according to him. If I wasn't in the industry I probably wouldn't have known what that even meant, and I find it hard to believe when there was 6 tables at max there with like 5 servers. The two tables near us were also complaining about  the time everything was taking and the service they were getting. When our apps finally came we didn't even get share plates with them, our server never came over to ask how anything was, and when our food finally came 45 minutes later not all of the food came. One of our kids food wasn't ready yet. We waited and waited for the food, we could see in the kitchen and see it sitting there while our server just stood near the computers. She finally noticed is looking, went to get it and it was absolutely disgusting. The potatoes had blood in them, Donny nephew refused to eat them, and the steak was inedible. Again no one came over to ask if we needed anything else. By time the server did come my sister explained how horrible her food was and she came over with the check saying she took it off. When she came over we explained that my nephews food was also horrible, which she also took off. Finally she brought the bill, without asking anyone if they wanted dessert (which we probably wouldn't have ordered anyway because everything took forever), we gave her the cards and asked her to split them. When she returned we noticed she split the cards for more than what the bill was originally for. That was the last straw and completely unacceptable.

The manager needs to be more concerned with customer service being provided (or lack of) then being the employees best friend. Will never come back here again! I keep trying over and over again thinking it will get better and it never will!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-milford,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88

3,Jesse M.,"Taneytown, MD",0,14,6.0,2.0,2017-05-10,"The place was empty but the bar was full. That should always put up a red flag. No one wants to eat there but plenty want to drink.  When I asked what beer they had on tap, the lady told me there was 10 different kinds, what kind do I like cause she didn't want to name off all ten.  Ordered the half rack of ribs and they were pathetic. Small with very little meat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-milford,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
13,Aldo D.,"Franklin, MA",0,1,,3.0,2017-05-18,"This was close to 4 stars. The waitress checked in regularly, although the kitchen disregarded the note about not putting onions in the quesadilla. The service from the kitchen wasn't bad but, it could have been a minute or two faster considering there were only 3 other tables or so and I came in by myself. Overall, the food was good, the drinks are good. I will definitely be back, maybe not soon but, I will dine here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-milford,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0

Our appetizer came out after our soup and we had to wait for refills on our drinks. Our waitress was stressed and getting yelled at because of the poor service from other tables.

16,Nancy D.,"Franklin, MA",15,12,,1.0,2017-06-20,"Sorry to do this really I am. This was always a staple when the kids were young and yes, it's a chain so expectations are kept in check. However, last Thursday went to lunch with my daughter. Arrived at 12:30 and it was dead! No problem, most likely a slow day. Waitress was so nice took our order and yes to my daughters chagrin I changed the cheese on my chicken sandwich ( that's worthy of an eye roll and a look that says, you are overcomplicating lunch... really)! Love it. Any way ordered their new southern fried chicken sandwich and my daughter ordered wings. Food took a while, perhaps longer that expected on a slow day with plenty of staff. Food arrives and I open my sandwich and turn it over to put some condiment on and it was charred beyond words! Not just a bit over fried, black!! It was served with fries and I had torn the bag just to see if they gave me the old fries when they redid my sandwich. 35 minutes later, my daughters lunch well over, back came sandwich 2... yup, same fries, ice cold. New sandwich, still burned which I attribute it to bad/old oil. They politely took it off the bill but guess what? Two managers circled my table yet not one said a word to me... not nice! I give our waitress so much credit but no we wont be back, and as a rewards member, I did not even take my card out.... I would have been saying thank you for an awful lunch. Sorry guys...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-milford,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
2,John M.,"Hopkinton, MA",0,1,,1.0,2017-06-21,"Just stopped by with my wife yesterday (June 20th, 2017) for a quick dinner. Once upon a time, TGIFs was a dependable, cutting edge chain of restaurants. That was a long time ago.  We waited 10 minutes to be seated (although the place was literally 90% empty). Our server was a nice 19 year old girl, but clearly was not at all well-trained by management. Despite her age, she served us wine (illegal?), and the food took f o r e v e r to come out.  Bottom line: Just a terrible experience top to bottom. I wouldn't be a bit surprised to find out that TGIFs is in bankruptcy -- that is how it felt. And all the while not a manager in sight.  Avoid at all costs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-milford,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
8,Raven K.,"Westborough, MA",0,51,,5.0,2017-06-27,Absolutely excellent service and top-notch food! Waitress was very attentive and polite and brought us things when we didn't even get the chance to ask for them because she had beat us to it LOL.

17,John C.,"Milford, MA",0,10,,2.0,2017-08-11,"I have been going to TGIF's all over the country since the 80's.   I always liked the consistency, trained personnel, friendly staff, and cleanliness.   Well the store at Milford is an anomaly. It smells like it is not clean,  the staff is poorly trained, I always have to ask for knife , fork, salt etc.  The food quality is  not good. If i did not have a huge number of points i would not go here.  The Applebees in town is far superior. Their staff is friendly and trained, and it does not smell like it needs a serious cleaning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-milford,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
14,Jordan J.,"Washington, DC",215,6,,2.0,2017-09-22,"The service was pretty bad. The gentleman at the bar took my order (to-go) and said it would be 15-20 minutes. 10 minutes later a well dressed businessman walked in and placed a to go order, the bar tender made sure to ask him if he wanted a drink while he was waiting (only asked me after because he saw me glaring at him). 35 minutes later, my food came out and it was so disappointing. I ordered the BBQ chicken salad. It didn't come with half the ingredients listed and they were so stingy about giving me anything other than romaine and a slab of chicken. Tastes so bad",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-milford,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04

1,Johanna G.,"Boston, MA",3,47,,1.0,2017-12-27,"The experience I had at this TGI Fridays is one I will never forget. But not for good reasons. The food took an hour after the order was placed. When we received our food ,   (finally),  half of it was cold. Dig in right?  One problem we had no silverware. To  our surprise not a single piece of silverware was placed on our table from the time we were seated. Which at this point was  going on an hour and a half.  The waitress was very lethargic, unfriendly, and unapologetic. She eavesdropped on our conservation, was a stickler regarding refills, and served watered down undrinkable strawberry lemonade. After a half and hour she told us , "" Good news, you are third in line.""  Is this the Olympics?  Broccoli cheddar soup had ZERO cheddar and  was cold with a film on the top,(clearly microwaved) how appetizing. Also I literally vomited up a TGI app sampler in an Eastern Bank parking lot off route 3.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-milford,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
