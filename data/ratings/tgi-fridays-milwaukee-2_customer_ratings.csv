35,Clarence S.,"Milwaukee, WI",28,10,26.0,5.0,2012-06-28,To me this Friday's is one of the best ones that I have been to. Especially that it is a baseball park at Miller Park. I enjoy there Margaritas here. Their food is very good here and the workers are very friendly. They are open all year round and if you are going there on game days make sure you have a ticket to get into the stadium. I will be back more often in the future.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-milwaukee-2?start=40,3.508,3.508,3.508,3.508,3.508
22,Stacie M.,"Burlington, WI",3,70,,4.0,2012-07-01,"Solid 4 stars for Friday's Front Row!!  We had a great time here celebrating my husband's birthday.  We decided to purchase a table in advance which was $350, which includes a $150 food/beverage credit.  Our table was on the Homerun Porch which overlooked left field.   The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star review is that they don't have the full Friday's menu here.  I really had my heart set on a Carribean Chicken Sandwich, but they didn't have it on the menu.  Bummer. The great part of this particular Fridays is obviously sitting overlooking left field for the Brewers Game.  However, if you really want to watch the game, it's probably better to get some great seats on StubHub.  It was really hard to pay attention to the game.  It's more like eating dinner, and casually watching the game.  But it was a great time!!  It would be really fun place for a girls night out (and a new drinking game...every time Ryan Braun bends over, you have to drink!!  Seriously, he puts on quite a show, bending and stretching...he's gotta be doing it on purpose!)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-milwaukee-2?start=40,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003
27,Sarah R.,"Westmont, IL",6,184,,4.0,2012-08-27,"We were just here this past weekend because a good friend's sister was running the Color Run at Miller Park.   I have been here before, but only during games when the Cubbies turn Miller Park into Wrigleyville North.  I didn't know that Fridays was open even if there are no games.  It was very cool to sit at a table in the stadium with no game.   Miller Park is a fun stadium any time and it is very pretty.  It was a unique experience to see it empty.  And my friend and her family have never been there before so it was all new to them.   We had a couple of appetizers and drinks.  Everything was good.  Typical Fridays food so you know what to expect.   After we ate we went to the outside patio (outside the park) for another drink.  There is not much of a selection, but I would stick to beer.  I got the Long Island which was just okay.  My friend got the margarita which was awful!  Stay away from the that!   The patio area is nothing special and although it stays open even though there are no games I don't know why anyone would bother.  However, eating at Fridays inside the park was a lot of fun with great views.  Worth the trip!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-milwaukee-2?start=40,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000007

It was all 13.1 miles of a half marathon!  It was wet and rainy and cold and miserable, but Miller Park made it great and the food and beers at Friday's helped out too!   First, Friday, we stopped to pick up our race day packets and decided we deserved a pre-race beer...which turned into a couple...then a few....it's Miller Park folks, enough said.   Second, Saturday, after the race they had a nice little tailgating party set up, but no one stayed very long, and well we were ready to CELEBRATE completing this run!  So, we hopped on over to Friday's once again and treated ourselves to a GIANT burger and a delicious Spotted Cow.   The service was about average both time we were there, but the beers were cold, they had sports on the TV's and we got to look out on Miller Park, so it made the whole experience 5 stars in my book!!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-milwaukee-2?start=40,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000007
16,Kyle H.,"Milwaukee, WI",903,1458,2728.0,3.0,2012-11-28,"Open year round, Friday's Front Row in Miller Park is a cool place to grab a meal before or during a game, and also in the off season as my son and I did recently! Upon entry we were greeted by a friendly helpful greeter, but service here is not super experienced.  It took our assigned server forever to come to the table to say hi and offer us drinks, and he did so setting dirty soda glasses from another table on ours. He really was nice and attentive after that, but I was a bit put off by that at first. If you're not seated on their patio overlooking the field, or inside by the windows, don't worry; that just means you'll be seated with a view of a bunch of flat screens that you'll be able to catch up on all the games!  We ordered: Carolina Pulled Pork sandwich w/fries (you can sub out sweet potato fries for a little extra), and the Hibachi Chicken Skewers with rice, zucchini, and teriyaki dipping glaze. Both were really good! The pulled pork sandwich came with a thin BBQ ""glaze"" on the side, and it was really tasty.  If you come on Brewers' Game Day your max dining time will be limited to 1 hour, but that seems fair. I'm so glad we popped in during the off-season, so now I know what the deal is for Game Day, and I won't hesitate to pop in either when the Brewers are on the road!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-milwaukee-2,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004

The waiter offered Reisling and then quickly returned to say they didn't have that either.  Being stripes members we were quickly served our complimentary warm chips and salsa which was very good.  Overall, our dinners were ok.  We all had burgers and appetizers including Queso, pot stickers, mozzarella sticks and spinach flatbread.  The spinach flatbread was a little ""flat"", everything else was ok.  Our waiter could have been considered either very attentive or very pushy as he kept coming back relentlessly to see if we needed anything, had made decisions, etc.  I took it as we were probably his only table; however, my mother who eats very slow, did not appreciate it - she felt very rushed.  In all - food ok, service ok, drinks ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-milwaukee-2?start=40,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.728000000000001
65,Sam H.,"Xinyi District, Taiwan",12,75,3.0,5.0,2013-04-09,"I am giving this 5 stars, because it is the best bargain in the house. I can't think of many places where you can actually sit outside with an actual table, and get proper food while watching mlb baseball. The food is regular TGI Friday's but really on a nice summer day, nothing beats it. I rather have proper food then crap nachos for almost the same price In fact, you could buy the cheap seats all the way up in 400 and just come down for a significant portion of the game. People in Milwaukee are quite spoiled when it comes to the abundance of cheap sports options. Appreciate this one! Some limitations:  Limited to 1 hour. So come during the middle of ball game before the 7th inning to maximize your time spent. By that time most of the tables will be emptied out from the first round of people eating before the game, or came during the 1st innings. Mininum $30 spend, which is really nothing considering how much alcohol.

49,Joanna T.,"Wauwatosa, WI",415,2214,1025.0,3.0,2013-07-09,"My witty husband refers to this location as ""Front Bro Fridays"" because of all the plaid shorted Chachi McChachsters flooding TGIF on game days. They're here for several reasons: 1. When a bro comes to a game, he wants to get a chill buzz on - enter the TGIF ""Ultimate Long Island"" which represents the greatest cheap booze = dollar ratio at Miller Park. They are so popular that they even have a separate line for them with a helpful sign ""Please have ID ready"".  2. Wings. Beloved by Those Who Pop Collars, hot wings can only be sourced here 3. Trixies hate beer. Tall Alabama Slammers can be obtained here for (relatively) cheap, meaning a bro might get lucky, amirite? There are a few compelling reasons for non-citizens of the Bronited States of America to visit, though. They are: A. Air-con. Especially on sweaty nights when they close the roof for NO reason B. Reasonable drinks - a very large beer + giant soda = $8. Way cheaper than the concession stands. C. Reasonable table minimums during game time. You can go unreserved with a 1 hr limit + $30 minimum spend or get whole game packages which include tickets and a very generous F&B credit.

45,Patrick M.,"Stevens Point, WI",31,119,452.0,3.0,2013-09-15,"Best priced food one can find when there is a game.  If you want to eat and watch the game up close, the outdoor seating has an AMAZING view of the Brewers baseball field but a wait can be expected for these seats. Tip: inside the restaurant, the tables lining the windows have just as good of a view and the wait will be much less AND a person feels like they have box seats inside with heat or A/C so ask for one of these to save time and have a great eating experience with professional baseball for entertainment. The menu during games is limited but the prices everywhere else in Miller park really make this place a deal. Be warned that the price of alcoholic drinks increases to $8 a cup for domestic beer during game time. I believe they have a one hour time limit per table during games. The nachos are $10 but a meal in themselves. The burger and fries are very filling.

If you can get in during a game (long wait) it's a very fun experience if you can get a good view of the field. The food is better than most, if not all, the other food in the stadium; it is also priced fairly, unlike the rest of the food at Miller Park.

Usually, I get terrible service at them, I was pleasantly surprised by our waiter last night. I don't think, even at the couple fancy steakhouses I've been at, have I ever been asked to cut into my steak to make sure it was the right temperature. Nice work with that.  But as for the food itself.....yuck. My steak was absolute crap. A ten oz steak, that was probably about 4 oz fat. Plus the glaze they put on it, just tasted disgusting. I didn't think I had ordered anything fancy, but maybe they put the Jack Daniels glaze on it? I can't figure out for the life of me where the disconnect was. The mashed potatos were edible but the mac and cheese simply wasn't.

33,Ricca V.,"New Berlin, WI",4,8,3.0,2.0,2015-03-26,"Stopped after a great show (Jesus Christ Superstar at the Milw School for the Arts). It was about 9:45 on a Sat night and quite slow considering we are knee-deep in MARCH MADNESS !  Probably a good thing. Even with many empty tables they cleaned off a dirty one while we waited. Once seated, we waited again  about 5 minutes later an apologetic waiter showed up to take a simple drink order 2 sodas a gin and tonic with olives, a whiskey sweet with cherries and a specialty vodka drink. Another long wait later and the g & t arrived with not one, not two but THREE cherries! The olives did not appear in the whiskey sweet  that should have been our first (or second )clue. I had just ordered plain water-no ice with lemons. That was apparently too complex and was not served until the food was on the table. Speaking of food; with very few exceptions; it is difficult to find anything that is not deep fried or grossly commercial. I ordered a side of the Ginger Lime Coleslaw in an attempt to add some fresh crunch to the slew of sub standard deep fried appetizers (pick 3 for $15) the coleslaw was so old it had a brownish rust cast and not a crunch to be found . Sent it back ,had it taken off the bill (not about the $. It's about the principle). Without a Brewer Game and in the dead of winter in a relatively empty bar/eatery on a Saturday night , don't you think they would have brought their ""A"" game?  I for one will never go back. It's just a shame to think that visitors from out of town coming here for the first time would have to go back home to tell friends about the AMAZING stadium that houses one disappointing food chain at this time of year!

12,Stephanie R.,"Beerline B, Milwaukee, WI",136,667,652.0,2.0,2016-01-24,"Both times we've been here there has not been a Brewers game, so the place has not been overly busy.  On our first visit, we just stopped in for drinks. One of the employees found out it was our first time in and took us on a bit of a tour and showed us some of the neat features, being that this restaurant overlooks Miller Park. It was a fun experience, and we talked about booking a spot during a Brewers game with friends, even though we're not big baseball fans. During our second visit, we ordered and paid for two drinks, then ordered some food which was placed on a tab. Another employee then entered the two drinks we had already paid for on the new tab. Luckily I heard him discussing this, otherwise we might not have noticed when we cashed out later. We were given some chips and salsa and ordered a pick three apps with boneless wings, potstickers and potato skins, plus I wanted to try the ahi tuna bites, so we added an order of those. The chips and salsa were so so, the chips being a bit greasy and the salsa a bit tart, but they were free, so that's cool. The rest of the food was pretty darn good. The cheese on the potato skins was sharp and of nice quality (yay Wisconsin), the potstickers were nicely browned on the outside and the wings were fine. The ahi tuna bites were good as well, although the guacamole dose was quite liberal. This whole time the bartender's dad was sitting at the bar and she took some food off his plate and ate it from across the bar. Awkward, as we were sitting right next to him. We sat for 30 minutes or so with dirty plates once we finished eating either due to the bartender being busy talking to her dad or just not realizing it would be nice to have them cleared. Around this time, a customer came in wanting to pick up a carry out order which the restaurant didn't seem to have any record of. Granted, the customer could have been a scammer, but the bartender never apologized or offered any condolences during the discovery process, and really mostly ignored her while talking about her to other employees as if she wasn't there.  The food was good on this visit, but the experience overall was fairly uncomfortable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-milwaukee-2,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84

The food is good - honestly I think the quality here is a bit better than the other locations. But it's the ambience that makes it great. Get to the park early and you can dine here in the comfort of air conditioning if it's a hot summer day. Then find your real seat in the stadium.  If you have to wait in line they just redid the bar area which is quite large and now has long high too tables with seats (it was standing room only before). Bathrooms are in the restaurant which is convenient.  Be aware that on game days you can only stay for an hour after being seated to give other folks the same great views. But If you go other times you can view the park for as long as you desire.  Finally sign up for their loyalty club and get offers for BOGO or special discounts while you are earning points.

If you like food, this place is pretty meh overall.  My dining partner had the Pecan Chicken salad which was tasty, but was it worth $12?  I'm not so sure.  I ordered the California Chicken Club.  The description said the baguette would be toasted but the chicken would be cold.  Everything was cold.  It wasn't bad, but Gouda isn't the best cheese to eat a chilled slice of.  I like Gouda, I just expected it to be somewhat melty because the warmed bread.  Because the baguette wasn't toasted, the bread was chewy.  Still, it was overall a good sandwich, but for $11 I kind of expect it to come as described.  Then we had two Sam Adams and they must have been $7 a pop and they came in a plastic cup. Honestly, people eat here for the ambiance and to watch pre-game activities.  The servers clearly are working for game times when they can make better tips.  (For the record, the service was fine, you could just tell everyone was watching the clock since the day we visited was a game day and the game had a 7:10pm start time).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-milwaukee-2,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

However, if you don't like that or can't handle that, maybe working at a place where the general and often drunk people congregate is not for you, people. To those I'd say go and find your happy someplace else. The staff was pretty rude when we came in at the 8th inning of a baseball game. Where customers pay for over priced, crappy drinks and attempt to have a few more minutes of a good time for what's left of a Brewers baseball game, you'd think they'd see it as a business and a few extra bucks.  There's nothing worse than black and white strict rules that don't allow for any flexibility of the situation at hand.  Upon entry, we weren't welcomed there. Upon walking outside for the last couple pitches we were severely not welcomed there. In the minutes that transpired and we were reprimanded and lectured about the rules and how we weren't welcomed, the game ended and then there were no more grounds for the staff to displace us. This place sucks basically. It's like walking into judgement and negativity and rules. I'm going to try avoid going forward, although there may be times where friends insist. The drinks are overpriced, Long Islands  taste like weak kool-aid, it's a chain restaurant so food not great, and add shitty staff attitude to it all - just forget it.
