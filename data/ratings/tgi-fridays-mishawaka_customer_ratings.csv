22,Tracy B.,"Osceola, IN",40,18,19.0,1.0,2012-06-26,This is the most filthy restaurant I've ever seen...ewww.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mishawaka?start=20,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.564000000000001
23,Nathan B.,"Raleigh, NC",15,91,51.0,3.0,2012-09-10,I've been here a few times with family. The servers are pretty good. The food is your typical chain restaurant type food. Whenever I'm there the place is empty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mishawaka?start=20,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003
25,K M.,"South Bend, IN",0,2,,4.0,2012-12-18,"I had a great meal! The servers are really friendly. The food was great, especially Potato Skins...huge fan! I'm so addicted to Jack Daniels glaze...that stuff tastes good on everything. I even had a little issue where something came out not exactly as I ordered....the manager took care of it...totally made up for it and then some. We always have fun here, so if you like a good variety of ""American"" classic food you will like it. I love going to a place where they remember me...I prefer it over similar places like Applebees and Chili's. My suggestion for dessert is Vanilla Bean cheesecake...though that new Whiskey Cake thing is seriously tied for my favorite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mishawaka?start=20,,,,,
0,David P.,"Mishawaka, IN",41,157,203.0,4.0,2013-02-17,"On our last visit, our server, Casey, was excellent!! The food was the usual overpriced frozen stuff.  Burger was tasty, messy & oversized.  Enjoyable, yet not WOW food. Our server was fun, friendly, chatty & helpful!  We'll ask for him next time.  Brought the rating up to that fourth star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mishawaka,,,,,
20,Robert A.,"Mishawaka, IN",1,25,25.0,4.0,2013-11-15,"Only went for drinks and appetizers and I was totally impressed . My wife saw a martini at the Ireland road location and asked for it here, the bar manager came to my table in person and found out what the drink was and made it exactly. That is customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mishawaka?start=20,,,,,
18,Jill H.,"South Bend, IN",0,3,9.0,5.0,2013-11-23,"Great service. Vanessa is my favorite. Great food. Surprisingly great prices. Enjoyed endless soup, salad, breadsticks, and a drink for only $6.99. Yes, endless! Saw they have 1/2 priced appetizers in the bar after 4 pm , so I'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mishawaka,,,,,
24,Marc F.,"South Bend, IN",0,5,,1.0,2013-11-24,"Food was just so - so. Definitely not worth the price they charge. Went there for dinner with my daughter, and when she ordered a drink, they asked for her id, and then server asked for mine. I thought server was joking, but apparently their corporate policy is to card everyone. I am 60 yr old. wtf!   Will not go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mishawaka?start=20,,,,,
19,Jean K.,"Edwardsburg, MI",0,18,,1.0,2014-06-13,Took my kids out for end of year report card (their choice) and all three of us ended up getting diarrhea within two hours. Called to let manager know and he took my name and number and said he would keep information on file.  When ai told him it was probably staphylococcus  he said they would look into it.  At no time did he offer any apology.  Will not be going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mishawaka,,,,,
21,alan p.,"Chicago, IL",0,10,6.0,5.0,2015-01-19,"the staff is wonderful, the kids loved the disco ball :) the manager came out & made sure our dietary restrictions were met. the beer cheese burger was excellent!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mishawaka?start=20,,,,,
10,T H.,"Mishawaka, IN",11,36,2.0,1.0,2015-03-07,Got the Jack Daniels chicken and shrimp for 18.90. Received 6 small shrimp and a very small piece of chicken with an even smaller scoop of mashed. Also took the brownie obsession to go and was an even smaller portion if you can believe that. I think I'm finally done with this restaurant. We have gone here so much over the years enduring crap service and/or crap food with outrageous prices. Hubby agreed that we won't be back. It's just not worth it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mishawaka,,,,,
16,robby W.,"Charter Township of Clinton, MI",103,13,,1.0,2015-07-16,I'm pissed they don't have endless apps like really though? Who opts out of their biggest current promotion?!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mishawaka,,,,,
12,Kristi B.,"Niles, MI",58,9,1.0,1.0,2016-01-04,"This was absolute worst experience ever. Everything was messed up. Ordered Sprite got Coke. Ordered jack Daniels chicken. Got chicken sandwich. Asked to order desert and server walked away. Hands bill, we ask about ordering desert, he says I put the Oreo in. I hate Oreos.... We want whiskey cake. The guy never really cared. We heard him yelling at his manager about not ""&@$$@!"" Caring about being written up either... Just terrible. My finances bday was ruined...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mishawaka,,,,,
15,Racine C.,"South Bend, IN",2,21,4.0,5.0,2016-01-04,I was having a supper bad day and had a flat tire. So I dropped my van off at belle tire and ran across the street to grab a soda. I have to say the customer service was amazing. I was worried of not getting good service cause I just wanted a soda but that was not the case. The waitress could tell I was having a bad day and went above and beyond to make my day somewhat better. The manager even did the same. This really impressed me and because of this I now enjoy going back. They really care about their customers and it shows. Good Job!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mishawaka,,,,,
14,Chris K.,"South Bend, IN",0,16,,3.0,2016-02-28,"Great food, menu options, and price.. service can be hit or miss as with all waiters/waitresses. For the most part above average. But when using points, gift cards, or coupons. It can be confusing Bc you can't use deals together. Like a $10 coupon for $50 purchase can't be used if you used the pick three deal or other menu options. Can sometimes be hard to follow.. love their food.. especially their crispy green beans.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mishawaka,,,,,
9,Philip A.,"Genoa, OH",29,32,16.0,3.0,2016-04-16,"Last minute place we stopped to eat. We have been to a TGI Fridays in a long time. The food was pretty good but I have had better. The chicken sandwich did not have enough of their jack Daniels sauce on it, so I had to order a side of the sauce.  I ordered the sweet potato fries and they came out cold! I had to order another side of those which took awhile and then they were too hot. Go figure! The French onion soup was good... But again I have a lot better French onion soup before... The kids food was good.. Just a small portion for them. Drinks were good and the service started out good and for worse as they got busy... My wife order the cheese cake and it was ok... I have had a lot better... It was a little pricey for my liking but it seems all restaurants are raising prices slowly... I gave them three stars just because they started off strong but slowly faded. Is this a must stop um not at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mishawaka,,,,,
17,Cody L.,"Mishawaka, IN",0,13,,5.0,2016-04-17,Always have a great time here. Usually eat inside the bar and bartenders are always awesome. Food always taste great and drinks made fast and fresh.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mishawaka,,,,,
13,Pat A.,"South Bend, IN",0,5,,5.0,2016-09-02,"Love the bar at this location. Me and my wife and most of our friends come to this location because of the great bar staff. Ian, Gabe, Stacey, and  Sea Bass, always treat us great. I love walking into a place where they remember your name and what you normally drink.  Drinks are cheap and food is always good. Keep up the good work!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mishawaka,,,,,
8,Troy H.,"Elkhart, IN",0,11,2.0,2.0,2016-09-17,"First table they tried to seat us at had nasty spill on floor, and table was sticky to touch. They saw displeasure and asked if we wanted next table over.Waited quite awhile before order was offered to be taken. Chose appetizer, and was not told full meals are also appetizers. Ribs had no meat to them on appetizer. My son got the Mahi Mahi way smaller then on menu flavor was lacking any, I ordered steak ribs combo... steak was lacking flavor ribs look as skimpy as the ones on appetizer dish. Would not come back here again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mishawaka,,,,,
5,Tim R.,"South Bend, IN",0,27,,1.0,2016-10-02,"This was one of the worst places I have ever been in! First Skyler our server was put out to wait on us, he took our order, brought our drinks, he came back only after we we were done eating to bring our check. Someone else brought our appetizer, someone else brought our dinner ( which mine was wrong and under cooked) salad was brought with our dinner, not before ( like most places) that was good, the only thing with the dinner that was good!! When skyler came back with the tab I asked why I was out of drink? And was never asked how it was, I let him know!! He said he had other tables, I asked what were we. Anyhow left him a 3.00$ tip and wrote on receipt under protest as for bad service  We will not be back!  As for tip, went to outback next day dinner was great bill about same left $15.00 tip.... oh yeah server was outstanding!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mishawaka,,,,,
11,Mary D.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,24,8.0,5.0,2016-11-19,Top notch service!!!!! Guy comes up to clear our area and thanks us for coming in. His name is Eric. His demeanor toward us is such that he might have been the owner!!!! I mean that by his concern for experience. Awesome!!!!! He is a bar server that night (bar tender other nights). Stacey is our bar tender tonight. She is extraordinarily friendly. Omg service at this place is great! Thank you for the awesome service!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mishawaka,,,,,

6,D J.,"Chicago, IL",1,89,24.0,3.0,2017-03-28,The steamed spinach is good however I warn about ordering pickup as it will take the hostess an ADDITIONAL 10 mins to return with your change after she has given you your food.. POOR SERVICE,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mishawaka,,,,,
2,Ann P.,"Mishawaka, IN",93,6,1.0,3.0,2017-04-03,"Unfortunately, I cannot give this Fridays more than 3 stars. I do not know who trains the staff at this restaurant, but it is completely different than the TGIF on the southside of town.    The seating and taking of drink orders was​ spot on. After that, we were ready to have our order taken, but the waitress said I will be back. We had said we were ready.    The food was good; what we expect from TGIF.    Waiting for the check took an inordinate amount of time.    Suggestions for the trainer: When customers order a salad or soup, ASK if they want it served before or with their meal. Watch the table to see drinks that are halfway to a quarter gone to ask if the customer wants a refill, bring the check over when the plates are 3/4 empty and/or the conversation has appeared to die down (after asking if they would like dessert and boxes).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mishawaka,,,,,
4,Barry S.,"Mishawaka, IN",19,16,,4.0,2017-06-18,"We go pretty regularly and have found the best servers are Skyler and Tyler.  Always friendly, attentive and great service. Love the bourbon barrel chicken.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mishawaka,,,,,
3,Linda M.,"Elkhart, IN",17,66,40.0,3.0,2017-07-07,"We have eaten here a few times. The food is good, nothing spectacular, but definitely worth the money. The staff isn't the friendliest, nor the tables the cleanest, but if you need to feed your family or grab a quick bite with some friends, this place will do just fine. The WiFi here is horrible, though, so if that's important to you, finding another restaurant might be best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mishawaka,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
1,Atlantis A.,"Mishawaka, IN",46,60,11.0,3.0,2017-12-06,"I've been going to this location for several years. Recently the place took a downhill slide. Dirty had a foul smell food sucked to mediocre at best the only reason that I would return was in hopes that things would improve. I know this staff in the bar and they are exceptional. On my last visit, just a couple weeks ago, my friend and I found that this location has redecorated in new paint. While the bar has been removed a couple TVs it smells a lot better. The new items on the menu look appetizing and I highly suggest Bayside of the new brussel sprouts. The sandwich I had was large in quantity very messy to eat and tasted okay. The drinks are very costly. for the size and amt of liquor you get.   At least my last visit gave me hope for my favorite TGI Fridays. Keep improving!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mishawaka,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
