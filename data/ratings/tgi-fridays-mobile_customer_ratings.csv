25,Rob N.,"Pacifica, CA",0,63,25.0,4.0,2012-01-16,"I'll tell you what, when you move to a place that doesn't have a certain chain restaurant, you miss it!  I was jet-lagged, hungry, and this place was steps from my hotel.  When you haven't had it in so long, not much can beat a Jack Daniels burger, fries and two Yuenglings!  I sat at the bar, and the bartender (Kimberly, I think) was very sweet and showed a lot of southern hospitality. The bar seats a lot of people, but I was there was one gentleman there besides myself.  I can't see leaving without getting another TGI Friday's fix.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mobile?start=20,2.096,2.096,2.096,2.096,2.096
24,Linda R.,"Washington, DC",8,18,65.0,3.0,2012-04-08,Late lunch 2 ish had the place to ourselves. Draft beer was out of order but bottle was cold. Food was prompt. Wedge iceberg was fresh and crisp. JD chicken was moist and yummy. Cheeseburger was also very good.  Fried green beans were not as fresh and crisp like last time/ place but still good. Service was good,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mobile?start=20,1.9000000000000001,1.9000000000000001,1.9000000000000001,1.9000000000000001,1.9000000000000004
21,Victoria G.,"Pensacola, FL",6,50,8.0,4.0,2013-11-09,"The wait was a little long but the food was good. Well, my bf's steak/ribs were good. My burger was greasyyyy. I ended up taking it apart and forgoing the bun about half way thru. Completely soaked in grease. It was like a sponge.  Service was good. Our waiter was very nice but the three girls gossiping and leaning on the podium at the front entrance were not the best thing to see/hear while waiting for an available table.  Overall, I'd probably be back here, probably not on a Friday, and I'd probably order a different burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mobile?start=20,,,,,
19,Patrick W.,"Dallas, TX",4,45,2.0,1.0,2014-03-15,"We had very poor service: had to order twice, remind her were still waiting iron our food, and found our own silverware. To cap it off, the bathroom was very dirty with an over flowing garbage can.  Rate to write a bad review but this was terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mobile,,,,,
10,Chad C.,"Fort Myers, FL",124,185,84.0,2.0,2014-06-07,So there were three hostesses and one guy in makeup who took forever to decide where to place us.  Then we did the 2 for 10 choose two.  My pot stickers were hard and over cooked and my french dip had a funny taste to it.  I think it was sweet onions on there not sure.   The drink was the best part.   A passion fruit ice tea but no free refills.  So I had to buy two.  I guess pretty standard for a chain restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mobile,,,,,
23,Brenda C.,"St. Petersburg, FL",1,40,,1.0,2014-07-24,"I gave one star out of consideration for the rude manager, turning 12 away because 1.5 hours later they had reservations for 3 tables, the consideration is because we ended up at Sabor Mexico and had an amazing meal with wonderful staff!  Realize, we didn't expected Fridays to even move tables, we simply asked to be sat at either 2 6 tops or 3 4 tops, somewhat close together.   The restaurant was not slammed nor did they have other patrons waiting.  If they don't have enough staff to run the restaurant at even near capacity,  maybe their corporate office should step in and retrain their management in appropriate ways to run a restaurant,  because the one here turned away a great deal of business tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mobile?start=20,,,,,
22,Evan M.,"Mobile, AL",1,1,,3.0,2014-12-01,The food itself was good but not very good for kids the bartender was nice and the waiters and employees were very polite you can dress casual for it or if you want to dress sharp but in conclusion it is a mediocre  resturant,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mobile?start=20,,,,,
13,Pam F.,"Mobile, AL",0,1,,2.0,2015-04-30,"Have you'll changed in better quality food. The server was GREAT, but the food was horrible!! We was celebrating my girl friend's b-day and the  Sampler Plate we had taste like it was cooked the day before. I celebrated my b-day here along with my Girls Night OUT Sisters in 2013, the food was GREAT and the service was GREAT also. Last night was horrible, food wise. The tip system is something to FOCUS on also, but the server deserved it, but the the cooks in the back, they deserve to be looking for another JOB! Step it up TGIF for Mobile, AL. We need everybody to shine on Airport Blvd. NOT close!!!! In Mobile they come and gooooo!!! Gone down hill in 2 years, Pink",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mobile,,,,,
7,Charli P.,"Mobile, AL",88,154,125.0,2.0,2015-05-06,"The best part of this restaurant was Dee the hostess.  We waited and waited for our waiter to take our order.  Seriously we sat for more than 10 minutes.  I had the Strawberry mule and it was great and hubby had a strawberry lemonade and loved it. He ordered Salmon with broccoli and parma fries, he loved his food.  I had the Cajun pasta and honestly it reeked of black pepper.  There was no dimension to the seasonings.   Because of the very poor service and the lack of flavor of the food, I doubt I will go back any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mobile,,,,,
14,Troy Z.,"Goleta, CA",1,43,13.0,3.0,2015-07-02,"Eaten here several times this past week. Good appetizers. The pot stickers are my favorite. Always decent service. Never been super busy when I have gone for dinner. Always been decent quality food for a medium price tag.  1 star for cleanliness, 1 star for competent host, wait, and bartended staff, and 1 star because none of the food made me sick. Missing the wow factor and the great deals to get to the 5 star mark.  Very convenient walking from hotel, much better than gas station food. Would eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mobile,,,,,
15,Lakeisha P.,"Grove Hill, AL",0,9,10.0,1.0,2015-07-28,"We dined here Monday (yesterday). We were disappointed. The hostess didn't know how to seat people. There were approximately twelve people dining in the whole restaurant, she seated all of them on one side of the place. We seated ourselves on the other side. The frozen Pina Colada was the worst Colada ever tasted. It was chalky, lumpy & unusually bitter even the pineapple on the glass was bitter so I ordered a sprite instead. After waiting ten minutes for the appetizer she brought it out & it was good,. The sizzling chicken, shrimp & potatoes were sizzling but wasn't hot at all, warm but not hot. I don't know how they made it sizzle. The entree tasted bland, everything on the plate tasted the same. My son's ribs were very sweet & burnt. His fries were old. My fiance's steak was burnt not medium rare & tough as well. We had to ask someone else's waitress to refill our drinks. I made sure she got a tip. Stopping there was definitely a waste of time & money. We won't be going back. .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mobile,,,,,
20,Eric C.,"Mandeville, LA",0,3,,3.0,2015-08-26,Kitchen wasn't on their game 100% with some members of our party waiting 15 minutes after everyone got their food to receive theirs. Staff OK but not A+. 2nd time visiting this location and it just seems a bit mediocre overall.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mobile?start=20,,,,,
9,Shane H.,"Mobile, AL",17,88,81.0,1.0,2016-01-17,"I'll keep this one somewhat short and to the point. This truly has to be one of the worst establishments in Mobile. All the way across the board, from the poor service, to the poor food. I'm amazed that they're actually still in business. I understand that this isn't the Four Seasons, but come on. Anyway, long story short, we won't be back. As you know, 0 stars aren't an option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mobile,,,,,
17,Lori M.,"Pell City, AL",38,9,7.0,1.0,2016-02-26,"I would give a zero if possible.  I was staying at the hotel next door and wanted dessert.  We were directed to the end of the bar to place out order.  After 15 minutes and all 3 bartenders looking at us, I had to go back to the hostess, complain, and she put our order in.  The bartender never apologized.  They were able to serve multiple people that came in after us.  Horrible and unprofessional customer service!!!! Skip this place!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mobile,,,,,
16,Kristie S.,"Phenix City, AL",25,6,35.0,2.0,2016-03-12,Multiple empty tables but a 30 minute wait.  What is up with that?  Talked to the manager and she just gave some BS reasons.   Manage the list better and schedule appropriate workers especially for a weekend evening you know will be busy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mobile,,,,,
18,Joseph N.,"Norman, OK",10,8,,1.0,2016-05-28,"Awful food. No real flavor, overly salted, and just plain disgusting. I might consider going vegan after my experience here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mobile,,,,,
11,Abdulrahman A.,"University City, San Diego, CA",1,1,1.0,1.0,2016-08-06,"Doesn't even worth a star but it's for the manager b cause, he almost cancelled our entire order.

12,Arnold L.,"Mobile, AL",13,141,,1.0,2016-09-24,Tonight we ate here with a party of seven. At 6 or people they have a mandatory service charge which is in lieu of a tip. But be careful as they then add a line stating that the recommended tip is an additional 18%. When the credit card slip arrives the service charge has already been added to the total and what you see is only recommended tip line which would bring the total tip to 36-40%. This is a cheap shot at deception and if you are not careful it is easy to add the recommended tip and provide a 40% tip which is rather high. Why Fridays has decided to try to cheat its customers or better worded deceive its customers is beyond me and I for one was rather taken aback by this practice. Shame on you guys!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mobile,,,,,
8,Ashley W.,"Tacoma, WA",31,2,,1.0,2016-10-29,"There were so many people on staff, yet the bathroom was disgusting. Anytime the bathroom is nasty, makes me worry about the kitchen. The food was okay, not worth going out to eat to be honest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mobile,,,,,
2,Ashley H.,"Mobile, AL",1909,594,3776.0,3.0,2017-01-08,"Normally I wouldn't drive across the Bay just to eat at a chain restaurant, but we had a gift card and I had things to do in Mobile anyway.   I have fond memories of going to TGI Friday's at Overton Square when I was young, and I really wanted to like this location.  I will say the service was very good, and it's the reason for that third star.   The food was a disappointment. The potato skins were loaded with bacon, but not as good as they used to be.  I decided on the sizzling chicken and shrimp. It came with two tiny pieces of flavorless chicken with a very slight amount of cheese, a few shrimp submerged in a thick, and overly sweet tomato sauce, and mashed potatoes. The potatoes were the highlight of the dish.  The hubs ordered a burger and it looked good.  He enjoyed it.   Our bill was a little over $40. If a gift card hadn't covered over half of it, I would have been extremely irritated.  There are many other places to eat for the same amount of money and better quality food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mobile,,,,,
5,Reka B.,"Mobile, AL",38,4,1.0,4.0,2017-04-02,"Service was great, food was good. Just the wait was long when it wasn't busy and it took awhile to get our food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mobile,,,,,
4,Lashelby C.,"Mobile, AL",0,2,,2.0,2017-05-22,So this time the Fridays super sucked. I feel as though this Friday's isn't on the same page as other ones cause the food comes out hot and drinks great. This time and the last couple times they just don't have anything on time and I have to wait 50 mins to get a simple order.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mobile,,,,,
3,James G.,"Knoxville, TN",0,4,3.0,1.0,2017-07-09,There is a reason this location only has two stars. Someone was being generous. Hostess didn't want to be bothered to busy face timing on her phone and service is slow slow slow. Table next to us couldn't get their drinks right. Payed for our drinks and left. Wasn't gonna pay for bad service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mobile,,,,,
6,Shelby T.,"Mobile, AL",0,3,,1.0,2017-10-25,"My father has been frequenting this particular location for years on Wednesday's with his golf buddies. They have 2 particular employees there who they've gotten to know and they are the reasons they go back. Well those 2 girls always leave by 5pm and all hell breaks loose after they do. We had the worst service and the worst experience with the manager that was on duty... some brown haired lady with glasses. The worst customer service from them ever. The waitress came back every time we questioned something that had not happened for our order and she was very ugly about it. Then when the bill came and the ribs my mother ordered were $19.99 on the check and not the $12.99 the waitress informed her about when we ordered. When my father told the waitress she was apparently wrong, she snatched a menu from the hostess stating ""they are accusing me of being a liar"" came back to the table and practically shoved the menu in my 75 year old fathers face! Let's just say it went down hill from there. That place has always had issues with servers and the kitchen! Even having an all day happy hour doesn't make people want to go there. Sadly this isn't the first time we've had a bad experience. We went years without going back. I can see again I just won't go anymore period. Years can't fix this place. I would close it down like they did cheddars and count your blessings. If the employees handled customers the way they do at your corporate headquarters then you might have a chance. Perhaps you should start having the call center train your servers and managers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mobile,,,,,
0,Ashleigh C.,"Satsuma, AL",60,106,113.0,5.0,2017-11-01,As I sit here having just finished a very good meal with some of the best service in have had in a long time I puzzled by the poor reviews. It's a Wednesday night at 8pm. I was promptly seated in the area of my choosing. Someone was by within 2 min to get my drink. I ordered an app hot wings from the $5 bar happy hr the were crispy and hot. Then my all time favorite Friday's entree is the sizzling chicken and cheese. It came out hot and sizzling just as it should. My amazing server Monica never once let my glass go below 1/3 of a glass and made sure when she sat down the bubbling cheese made sure it was turned away from me to keep me from getting splattered with grease. Monica was also very attentive to ensure my meal progressed to my liking. I'll defiantly be back and would love for Monica to take care of me!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mobile,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
