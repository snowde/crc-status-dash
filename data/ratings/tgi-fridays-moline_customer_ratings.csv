21,David N.,"Chicago, IL",14,28,,3.0,2012-05-22,"Good Food, Good Drinks, Moderate Pricing.  Had nachos and Hummus Plate.  Hummus was extra spicy.  Beer list was good mainstream beers.  View of the river was great.  this restaurant has dockage for small and large yachts to 40 feet.  as usual as tgi fridays, the food leaves you with some greasy heartburn, but that's par for the course when dining at fridays in general.  the menu is confusing and basically every choice results in a tab of $40 to $60 for bar food that would have traditional cost $30.  this is a well run franchise that offers good food, drinks and a view of the river.  Waitstaff is average.  As a sidenote on the Moline River Parkway.   Patrons should be careful NOT to walk down the Moline riverwalk toward the new KONE tower.  this is a dangerous deserted walkway that is an ideal place for felons of all kind.  In our traversal to the Stoney Creek Inn, no less than two rustlings took place in the bushes just feet from this walkway.  we felt lucky to have walked back to our hotel safely.  downtown moline is safe in general but only when lots of people are around.  quiet dimly lit corridors should be avoided at night.  This is not the parkways that I am used to walking in chicago that are brightly lit and have ample crowd flow in to the night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-moline?start=20,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997
26,Rue J.,"Moline, IL",1,32,,2.0,2012-11-26,"I've experienced WAY better. The staff was pick and choose on friendliness. They were clean, but not prompt. The food was mediocre, and for the price should have (I thought) been much better. They have a great locale, but terrible (horrible!) parking. (My cheese was burnt to the bottom of my plate and my Honey's dish was covered in soy sauce to the point of gagging.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-moline?start=20,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000004
23,Brodie H.,"Davenport, IA",1,12,,2.0,2013-04-27,"Great location, cool atmosphere and a friendly staff. Loved everything about the place... but the food. Terrible sides and appetizers.. and mediocre at best main dishes. Too bad because the place could be a pretty cool spot. Have been there twice and my only recommendation would be, if you're going to get sides or apps, make sure what you get is fried. Anything that doesn't touch a frier is absolutely disgusting. Best part of meal is that the overpriced main dishes were edible. Probably won't give it another chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-moline?start=20,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000004

24,Catherine B.,"Galena, IL",0,1,,4.0,2013-11-02,Great waitress...Erin S. Had 6 oz. Sirloin. It was delicious! Husband had grilled chicken cobb. He raved about how tasty the grilled chicken tasted. The cup of clam chowder was one of the best I have ever tasted.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-moline?start=20,,,,,
22,Timothy S.,"Moline, IL",8,22,,2.0,2014-03-02,Disappointed.  Don't have specials that TGI posts all over Internet for Sundays.  Said because they are a franchise they don't honor corporate TGI specials and do their own thing. Really?   Not impressed.  Only reason we decided to stop here was the advertised specials.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-moline?start=20,,,,,
14,Alisha M.,"Palos Heights, IL",157,257,149.0,2.0,2014-06-27,Service was friendly and swift food was under cooked and under seasoned. I know it's a Fridays but I still was hoping it would be better,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-moline,,,,,
18,Justin M.,"Orlando, FL",51,100,15.0,2.0,2014-07-18,"A party of 7 (myself included) were seated quickly. The server took our drink orders and came back with them promptly.  We ordered a few apps for the table since they were on special. We the. Placed the entree order. A bit later the apps came out and the food expediter was chewing gun with her mouth open!! Nasty!  Apps were mediocre at best. Green bean fries, cheese sticks and spinach and artichoke dip. The dip had like 10 chips so we needed more. The other stuff was ho hum.   The meal wasn't special and my brothers steak was well when he asked for medium rare. He finally got a new one but it was way after we all finished.  I tried the whole meal to use the app to pay and it seemed that no one knew how to do it. The other reviews are correct. Avoid this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-moline,,,,,
17,Christine H.,"Omaha, NE",68,398,142.0,3.0,2014-08-06,"I can't say I went into this dining experience with high expectations, but I would say that our meal was good. Btw, why do chain restaurants like this always smell like mop water? Applebee's, tgi Fridays , ruby Tuesday, they all smell the same!! Anyhoo, I got the black bean burger, actually pretty good! Nice spice, could have used another slice of avocado though. My husband also enjoyed his burger. Our kids like their cheeseburger and Mac and cheese and the fruit they got was actually fresh. Good place for a bite in downtown moline if you have little ones with you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-moline,,,,,
13,Tim R.,"Collierville, TN",0,23,,2.0,2015-07-21,"Food is fine.  My review is based on a weekday lunch trip, around 1:30 PM.    Basically,  when we were here we were wondering if this place had a manager,  because it just seemed like things were out of sync.  Plenty of tables,  but since the hostess wasn't around when we arrived,  it took awhile to get seated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-moline,,,,,
15,Bonnie T.,"Chicago, IL",1,10,,1.0,2015-08-12,Dinner for 1.  Going on a 20 minute wait.  And the restaurant is half empty.  It's probably 30% filled.  Why? Update.  My dinner was satisfying.  Steak.  Yummy.  But these guys do not look busy and all the tables around have not been bused since I got here.  And I'm on the patio which is beautiful.  But the dirty plates are attracting the bugs.  Thumbs down guys.  Thumbs down.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-moline,,,,,
19,Steve H.,"Orlando, FL",6,195,42.0,3.0,2015-09-07,"Could have been 4 stars, however I sat at the bar, someone asked me if I had been served, saying no, could I have a beer, she brought it, unfortunately it was piss warm, took two sips, Second she handed me menu then took 15 min to come back to ask what I wanted, food was great , minus the fact that the Jack Daniels ribeye was thin very thin, still taste great, but jeeze gimme a freaking steak not a tease. I got a bottle beer it was ice cold to the finish, problem is the draft system doesn't keep keg beer cold enough, fix it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-moline,,,,,
16,Jill V.,"Cedar Rapids, IA",83,5,,5.0,2016-01-15,"This is our go-to spot after every concert at the iWireless center. Everytime we go, we are many beers deep and starving. No matter how obnoxious we are, the staff puts up with us, with a smile on their face.  They aren't annoyed that they have to serve post-concert customers and provide great service. It's the waiters and waitresses that really make this place. The foods good too! Love the pretzel sticks appetizer!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-moline,,,,,
5,Tom H.,"El Paso, TX",520,299,966.0,4.0,2016-02-29,Came to the restaurant after my flight and ordered the Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta.  The meal was good and the server Kim did an excellent job.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-moline,,,,,
20,Joseph P.,"Weehawken, NJ",12,16,5.0,1.0,2016-03-25,"Okay.  Look at your receipt... This review is for Corporate TGI Fridays America which just tried to pull a quick one dollar trick on me. I'm not a nickel and dimer when it comes to food... but I do like to see principle.  The half rack Jack Daniels ribs with fries and cole slaw was listed at $11.59.  On the bill it came to $12.60.  I ask myself...  how many people do they do this to?  I mentioned nothing to the bartender, and waited for the manager.    Of course he was nervous and said he knew that that problem exists and that they have to manually take the 1 dollar off.  I discussed further that he should probably revise the menu... and he said corporate IT takes forever to change the prices on the menus.  Why not do this manual change instead of letting it get to the customer everytime? One star.  Nice staff, decent ribs, but sneaky on the charge.  Don't charge that price until the menu comes out revised... or put the new price ovwr the old one with a neat sticker...  dispicable.  I feel this is untrustworthy.  They probably rip so many people off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-moline?start=20,,,,,

Husband got jack Daniels slider lunch, I got Cajun chicken pasta lunch. Sliders had meat and cheese no sauce very bland. Pasta was  way over done with parsley garnish.

0,John H.,"West Des Moines, IA",35,231,147.0,3.0,2016-10-18,"Great outside patio with tables on two sides of the building to accommodate the ever changing Midwestern weather. We sat outside on a surprisingly warm and pleasant October evening and enjoyed drinks and dinner on the patio. The inside space is pretty large with a good-sized bar as well, Food was pretty good - normal Friday's stuff. I had a chicken sandwich which was plump and juicy, with good toppings and my dining companion had a grilled chicken dinner with rice and sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were appropriately cooked which seems to be a challenge at a lot of restaurants these days. Drinks were good and our waitress was attentive and efficient. Food came out amazingly fast even though we were lingering in our time on the patio to enjoy the unseasonable weather. Overall just fine - decent option for downtown and you can be pretty sure you know what to expect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-moline,,,,,
9,Pajamas F.,"Pineville, NC",62,13,4.0,4.0,2016-11-11,First night in Moline we decide to go here for drinks and wings. It was a great choice. Tony who help serve us was awesome and super friendly.

8,George C.,"Moline, IL",0,16,,3.0,2017-06-27,"It's under new management, after years of having the same manager.   Wait staff is attentive, food is Good.   Menu changes frequently, and not being a meat eater, there were a few times where I've resolved myself to either a side salad or broccoli.  Those times are few and far between.  I've gone to this restaurant since they've opened, and unlike many restaurants, where wait staff turns over every year or two, there have been some people working there for 15 plus years.  Great dock to pull up your boat at, and eating inside or out on the patio.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-moline,,,,,

3,Christine I.,"Davenport, IA",49,4,,1.0,2017-09-03,"Terrible service and equally disappointing food.  Waited about 15 minutes after being seated to flag down a server to be told she would see who was our server.  This was after being seated by a host who neither said hello, not smiled - not at us or at anyone else.  Finally a server came to wait on us and didn't say anything about our wait.  When the food came, which was quick, it was lukewarm at best.  We ordered their signature Jack Daniels ribs.  They feel of the bone, but only because I think they had been sitting around somewhere.  Anyway, all in all, it was a very disappointing evening.  We're making this one off our list of places to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-moline,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
1,Greg A.,"New Market, MD",2,5,,1.0,2017-10-24,"Walked in asked about any local beers. IPA's in particular. They had one and my friend and I both ordered one. Bartender asked if we wanted a tall or a short. We ordered tall.  After we had our beer, we looked at the specials menu (shame on us) and saw that their Tuesday special was draft beer $3. Less than half tyhe price of a tall. No big deal really. However, we asked the bartender  (Devon) why he didn't tell us about the special and his response floored me... ""We're not obligated to tell you here""!  Not something I would expect from anyone that lives in the Midwest!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-moline,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
2,Stephen J.,"Moline, IL",0,19,,2.0,2017-12-16,Typical corporate restaurant.  High prices for mediocre food.  Stay away from the French dip.  It's mostly grilled onions with a small amount of meat.  The dipping sauce is nothing more than bullion juice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-moline,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
