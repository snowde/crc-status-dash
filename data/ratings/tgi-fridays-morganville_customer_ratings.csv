39,Alexandra S.,"Old Bridge, NJ",16,19,17.0,1.0,2012-01-25,"This Friday's was terrible!!!!!!! I love Friday's, so for me to say that, you know it was bad.  My boyfriend and I walked in at around 9:45PM and stood at the hostess station for about 5 minutes.  There was a table full of employees who saw us standing there and did not let anyone know that we needed help.  Finally we decided to go to the bar and see if we could order food there or at least find a way to get a table.  The bartender made us wait for another couple minutes (on a slow weekday night, there were maybe 5 other people at the entire bar) before my boyfriend finally had to yell out to him, asking if the kitchen was still open.  He said it was.  We were finally able to get a table but then our waitress was rude and slammed our menus and utensils down on the table as if serving us was a bother.  We thought that maybe the kitchen closed at 10PM and that is why we were getting attitude, so we just left.  Then I called this Friday's to see when the kitchen closed -- not until 11PM that day.  So, we still have no idea why the service was so terrible.  I would highly recommend going down the road to the Friday's on Route 9 in Old Bridge.  They are very nice there and accommodating.  This one has AWFUL service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-morganville?start=20,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000004

We had a very attentive waitress.  We went in with a party of six and hit the kitchen with seven appetizer orders they scored on all but one of them, which somehow they forgot or never prepared.  I am willing to overlook that though because everything else was that good and fresh.  Always been a fan of Friday's after 10 PM for half price apps.  Happy I found out about half price Sunday afternoon apps.  Will def return!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-morganville?start=20,2.032,2.032,2.032,2.032,2.032
37,Maria S.,"Englishtown, NJ",0,21,2.0,3.0,2013-01-03,"I've never had a problem with this Friday's. It's a chain of course, so the food was as unremarkable as any other Friday's or Applebee's. I do prefer Friday's over the local Applebee's though, simply because my food always comes out piping hot. I think this is because this Friday's isn't as busy as the local Applebee's, so the service is faster and better. I've never had a bad experience with the service here; they seat you quickly and are attentive to your needs. Plenty of parking here too. The restaurant is clean and good for families. I particularly enjoy TGI Friday's drinks. They're large, delicious, and have a large amount of alcohol, which works for me! They're also very sweet. Sure, maybe they're girly and not sophisticated, but I have to admit, I'd take an enormous, yummy Lava Flow any day over a tiny cocktail at a snobby lounge in the city. As for the food, well... I'm not a fan of most huge chain restaurants' food, and TGI Friday's is no different. I'd steer away from steak or chicken here... Shrimp is okay, but not fresh. I'd stick with something simple that's hard to mess up, like a sandwich, burger, or even chicken fingers. The Jack Daniel's and New York Cheddar & Bacon are alright. California Club sandwich is good. Salads are large and full of unhealthy ingredients to make it taste good, which I don't like but I'm sure other people do. All the desserts are amazing and terrible for you, but I love the Brownie Obsession, Oreo Madness, and Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie... Mmm. Appetizers are fun, I like the Chip n Dip trio, Green Bean fries, and Classic Mediterranean Hummus. Nachos are better here than Applebee's too, mainly because they don't come out soggy with hard, cold cheese on top. All in all, I like to come here for a simple lunch or dinner and split appetizers with friends while sipping on a few drinks. Come here for happy hour! They have $1 basket fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-morganville?start=20,1.9000000000000001,1.9000000000000001,1.9000000000000001,1.9000000000000001,1.9000000000000004

25,Travis T.,"Mission Viejo, CA",188,197,26.0,1.0,2013-05-25,"I've only felt more justified giving a one star review one time before this. Here's a little story about THIS Friday's, which is listed as ""Morganville"" but it's in Marlboro.  1. I moved from NJ to San Diego 4 years ago, since then I've became a Padre's fan because rooting for the Yankees isn't fun. Called and asked if they would have the Padres vs. Diamondback game available to watch that night. After 5 minute hold period, they told me they would have it. Only damn reason I went there, and they couldn't get the game on. 2. My fiancé and her sister went with me and were complaining of a vomit smell at the bar. I have a head cold so I couldn't smell anything, and thought nothing of it, until the girls next to us looked over and starting confirming the smell with each other as well. If it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck.... 3. Drank Yuengling lager on tap the whole time I was there. They had a 3 dollar domestic 20 oz. beer special. Here's the cherry on top, Yuengling counts as a craft beer at Friday's. OH COOL BRO, THANKS FOR TELLING ME WHEN MY RECEIPT CAME. Paid 6 dollars per beer, doesn't wreck the wallet or anything, but it sure is double 3 dollars. Mark my words I'll never be back to another Friday's... ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-morganville?start=20,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001
31,Joe B.,"Freehold, NJ",361,564,28.0,1.0,2013-10-13,"Ok, they aren't closed so let's get that out of the way. Oh how I wish they were!  First of all. I usually don't like to give my money to businesses that have been convicted of ripping off the customers! By this I mean that not long ago, the ownership of Fridays restaurants all over this area were caught by the liquor authority swapping low end booze for top shelf! So when you thought you were getting Grey Goose, you were really drinking Gordon's! But that aside, my wife had a gift card for this place so off we went. Our waiter was a nice kid, but completely lost in space!. He takes our orders, but we have to tell him that we have a choice of sides. Never asked us. Our appetizer took a half hour to be brought out ! Not a big deal except that it was potato chips with melted cheese sauce on them! I could make that in 28 seconds! Not only that, the chips were so soggy, I thought they were stored under water!  Of course, not a minute after the appetizer makes its appearance, they bring out the entrees! My ribs were incinerated!  No taste! Just so you know, I like burnt ribs, but this was,ridiculous! My sweet potato fries were wilted. My wife's chicken tasted like it was in a fire!  Let me not forget my beer. I asked for a Sam Adams Octoberfest. This is a mainstay at this,time of year in almost any establishment. Apparently not in Fridays. They were out do,it at 4:30 in the afternoon ! So I went with a Shocktop. Guess what......no glass!   I am the last person that would ever be called a food snob, so for me to rip a place is newsworthy. Food sucked and service was pathetic.

Food was good but the service not so good.  The hostess sat us down at our booth and we waited over 20 minutes for a waitress to even approach us just to say hello. Drinks took forever to be refilled. We were barely checked up on... Took forever for our waitress to even come give us the check and then she kept asking if we were ready to pay as she saw us trying to split the bill. It just overall was bad service. To top it all off, my friend and I got charged twice and different amounts. I was suppose to be charged $40, which I was but then a random $32 charge appeared on my card- 3 days later. And somehow, the same thing happened to my other friend.. Which btw... she is still waiting for a refund over a week later.. And my mystery of a charge has yet to be solved.  Aside from having bad service, we now have to deal with the drama of getting our charges in order.

However, our last visit to this TGIF was horrible enough to never come back. We sat at a table for 15 minutes before our server came to greet us (after ten minutes, we asked our hostess who our server was). Furthermore, after we ordered and received our appetizers, we weren't given silverware or plates for ten minutes (by this time, our food was cold). Our server was completely inattentive so when our entrees finally came, half of it was overcooked and the rest oversalted. By this time, we were too exasperated to send them back and wanted to finish the meal as quickly as possible. As we waited the 15 minutes given the credit card and check back to our server, we heard the table next to us send their steak back because it was raw (the same dish that was cooked to a crisp at our table).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-morganville?start=20,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000005

Yesterday reminded me why when I ordered the Fish and Chips and with three customers in the place, the cook couldn't pay attention enough to not just overcook the fish in the fryer but burn it black. And then not care enough to actually look at this carbon rock and rather thought it was a good idea to give it to a Yelper. Waiter apologized but he looked at it and served it to me. Nothing like crunchy rocks.  Even the frys had no taste and you think chips, you don't expect frys.  Also had the potato skins. Came with runny sour cream. Normally you'll get something a little thicker. Waiter needs to find a better place to work. They don't deserve the guy.  I did send the meal back, which, rather than just take my plate, they made me shovel the fish on to another plate. About 15 minutes later, the reorder came out but the person I was with had finished his meal already and had to wait for me. Just not a good experience.

Two major turn offs however... on the receipt they give a minimum suggested gratuity of 18% of the bill, and suggest two higher percentages as well. The standard for American tipping is 15% for a job well done. I'm not responsible for paying your employees wages, TGI. I tip as I see fit, and trying to guilt clientele into over-tipping is just bad manners to say the least. Second dislike are the computer screens placed on the already small 2 seater booths. Everything on these screens is geared toward children so that their parents don't have to 'parent' them, which is distasteful to begin with, but worse, every time you touch the screen it's chargable. Literally every application on these sort of monitors costs money to use. Having seen this kind of nonsense before, I promptly asked the waiter to remove the screen from our table, as it took up a lot of space, and we had no intention of using such a ridiculous machine. The waiter, although polite, was obviously not accustomed to being asked to have the screen taken away, and you could tell he was probably instructed by his superiors to encourage use of the screens. Not his fault, however, but that of the establishment.  I would rate higher if the screens were not placed on every table in a mandatory fashion, and also if the receipts removed that preposterous ""suggested gratuity"" text. I'm sure people know how to do math on their own, so please don't insult my intellect by insinuating that is it's intended purpose.

10,Helen Anne J.,"Manalapan, NJ",0,30,,5.0,2017-09-02,TGI Fridays has under gone a lot of staffing changes. The new staff is very upbeat and positive. They are telling everyone that it is Happy Hour and talking about the 1/2 price apps and drink specials.The appetizers all came out hot and were prepared and plated nicely. Elyssa was our server and she is very pleasant and does a great job. Anastasia was the manager on duty and she was right on top of everything. Keep up the good work!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-morganville,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
1,David I.,"Englishtown, NJ",21,19,2.0,1.0,2017-11-15,12/31/17 7:30 UPDATE After several terrible trips here I am forced yo lower the rating to a 1! I'd give 0 if I could! The last ten times we gave come the good gas either been stale(see pictures below) or the service is non existent. We have kept coming back though because we have reward points. TODAY is new years eve and my dad and I just had the worst experience ever. The entire restaurant was complaining! There was only one Cook today and all the tables were waiting an hour of more for food and drinks even chips took 45 minutes. On top if that our server brought NO napkins  Finally I showed him a spot on my arm where jack Daniels sauce had fallen onto it and he said he would be right back with napkins and he still took 15 more minutes while I sat there with sauce all over me. To make matters worse when the food finally came out it was STALE. We got the full rack of ribs which we get every week. Today they were so tough I almost broke s tooth. Since the kitchen was backed up no waiters or waitresses were on the floor and we sat there for 45 minutes waiting to talk to someone about getting a replacement for the good we couldn't eat! Finally I got out of my booth and asked the assistant manager Frank why the manager Vinny still hasn't come over to our table 45 mins later. Frank was extremely rude to me. He didn't once apologize. He told me he didn't care if we walked out and he said Vinny is busy I n the kitchen just leave. He said in a mocking tone ''Have a nice day'' Keep in mind my dad and I are regulars here. We come here at least 3 times per week. Frank was so nasty it was terrible! So we did what he told us. We walked out! It was such a waste if two hours. Especially because we only took a few bites of our food. I did get a peak in the kitchen. It was chaos! Vinny had to work it because the only Cook there kept screwing up. You know a place has problems when the manager is doing kitchen duty. I'm attaching pics of rotten tomatoes from two different visits as well. My friends/family and I frequent this Friday's quite often Service is hood depending on who you get(our favorite is Tyler). Food can be inconsistent however it's usually very good which keeps us coming back. Only gripe is they reduced the choices on the endless apps and raised it fr 10 dollars to 13.  I also really like the rewards program. Overall a solid place..4/5 rating,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-morganville,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
3,Alexis M.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",0,2,,1.0,2017-12-03,Food tasted weird. The only thing I wanted to take home they refused to give me a to go container because it was endless apps. Called to speak to the manager at the table and he was a complete ass.  I wonder what they really do with the food after. It's such a waste of food if that's the case. I don't care to go and buy other food but the fact that they throw it away rather than giving it to the customers to take home is ridiculous like so many people out there are starving for them to be just throwing shit out.  Not even from NJ so we didn't know and every other Fridays we've been to never denied giving us a to go container Stupid asf if you ask me.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-morganville,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
5,Jorge R.,"Oradell, NJ",0,10,,2.0,2017-12-15,I don't know what has happened to TGIF in Hackensack. Service was mediocre and food was less than adequate. I ordered french onion soup and is was like warm. The three for all came out with the wring order. This was my go to place for a quick bite- but no more. It took forever for the server to take our order and the place was empty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-morganville,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
4,John C.,"Morganville, NJ",0,13,,1.0,2018-01-01,"Terrible service. The place had a few customers and was almost empty. I stood by the entrance for 15 minutes waiting to be seated. Two staff members just walked by without saying anything.  Another lady that was also waiting to be seated, walked around looking for the hostess. I gave up and just left and went to another restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-morganville,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
2,Ashley V.,"Parlin, NJ",29,43,17.0,1.0,2018-01-01,"I wish I could give 0 stars! The place smelled like sewage, right next to the kitchen. The host told us he didn't know where the smell was coming from-are you serious? We should have left right then and there. That's our mistake. We were the first people there and waited almost 2 hours for our food and kept being told it was coming out any second. The last meal to come out, when we were almost done was a salad someone ordered-a salad!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-morganville,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
