45,Maria M.,"Morrow, GA",6,12,,5.0,2012-02-12,"My boyfriend and I celebrated V-Day weekend here on Saturday night and it wasn't even our first pick. We planned to go to Joe's Crab Shack, just up the street, but after being told the wait would be at least an hour, we were out of there. We had talked in the past about going to Friday's, but hadn't been there together before. We went in and it was crowded to be sure, but we had assurance from the host that he would have us seated in 20 to 25 minutes and he delivered. This was very impressive, considering they were packed and had several group parties waiting. My next concern was the quality of the food, as I know that when restaurants get crowded, food and service tend to suffer. We were starving, so we started with an appetizer of potstickers, which I'd eaten at other places before, but my boyfriend had never tried. They were absolutely delicious and the price was right for six of them. They and the drinks arrived in a very timely manner, and no more than ten minutes after we finished the appetizer, did the entrees arrive. I ordered ribs and my boyfriend ordered a steak. Everything was cooked to order, at the temperature it was meant to be and my ribs had the meat falling off the bone. No utensils needed and zero toughness. Same went for Jarvis' steak, who ordered his well done. The service was spectacular and our waiter was just being himself and genuinely kind at that! I even saw the manager working the floor: seating, busing tables, serving food and drinks, he was on top of it all. Jarvis and I were very pleased with our experience from when we walked in to when we walked out and that is why I'm giving TGI Friday's on Mt. Zion Blvd. a 5 star rating!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-morrow?start=60,2.42,2.42,2.42,2.42,2.42

The service was slow our server have a terrible attitude and made it seem like we were out of line for asking him for a refill on our drinks after waiting for a while for him to notice.

I'm not surprised that the manager passed by without asking how was the food because he knows it was nasty.  My mother ordered the Parmesan crusted flounder, which was just fish with raw bread crumbs tossed on it. No flavor at all bland just like the white rice.  This is just horrible food at cheap price, regretted going at all.  I fell out of love when they stopped serving my favorite dish--cedar seared salmon over pasta with zucchini, yum BRING THAT BACK",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-morrow?start=40,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.9240000000000002

When we seated we sat there for a good 5 min before being approached by our waitress. We received no apologizes or even a name from here just a quick what can I get you to to drink. When she finally came to take order she did so without writing it down. We ordered an appetizer and two entrees. The appetizer never came and the meal came out slightly off. The steak was missing the Jack Daniels sauce that it was supposed to be marinated in. My burger was fine. Even after giving awful service the entire time when she greeted us with the check she finally gave us a wide smile and said thank you guy have a great evening in hopes of getting a better tip than deserved.

38,Tia H.,"Stockbridge, GA",64,40,41.0,3.0,2013-06-06,"My kids and I were in need of a little ""us"" time, so we ventured to Mt. Zion Rd.. My daughter wanted to use one of her ""Reading Is It's Own Reward"" coupons from school, so that pretty much sealed the deal on selecting T.G.I. Fridays. We were told it would be a 20 minute wait to find seating(even with the restaurant being only 60% full), and 20 minutes it was. We were seated and waited on by Pierre. Pierre did an awesome job, though you could tell that he was a little flustered. We ordered drinks, which took a little while to get to us. The Mango Peach slush...yum. We then ordered an app and our entrees, with the kids getting chicken strips, cheeseburger, fries, and a fruit salad. I ordered the Korean Steak Tacos cooked medium. (I keep setting myself up for failure regarding steak temperatures...) The food took about 30 minutes to get to us, with the kids' food coming first, then the app immediately after, and then my tacos. The appetizer, we ordered the Pick Three-For-All pretzels, Fried Mozzarella, and boneless wings. The mozzarella was COLD. It was so cold that the cheese solidified throughout the whole stick. I asked him to take it back, but by then the kids were eating it up, so I left it alone. The Korean Tacos were DELICIOUS! I didn't really care for the lettuce on top, they should substitute that for more cilantro, but oh man they were good! The jasmine rice had a garlicky flavor that I loved, and the Sriracha was perfect on the tacos. When I asked for the check, it took a while to do because Pierre kind of disappeared, but he still gave excellent service.  I don't know if there's a disconnect with the kitchen and the servers, or if they need more employees, but there's something amiss with T.G.I. Fridays.

29,Dionne A.,"Atlanta, GA",3,43,17.0,3.0,2014-01-08,"They often get larger orders wrong when you call it in even when you have the person on the phone READ it BACK to you and it is CORRECT. This is because the person who reads it back to you is the hostess and not the person who keys it.  So they try to show you the receipt that was keyed (incorrectly) to show that you did not order something. And the only way of ""proving"" that something was really ordered is if the hostess admits that the mistake was theirs and that the person who keyed it, keyed it incorrectly.  They really need a better system for calling in orders. Seems like they are always messing up something. Three stars instead of two because if they are wrong, they will usually give you the meal on the house for the inconvenience.

I ordered the Jack Daniel's chicken and shrimp and he got the kids macaroni and fruit cup. My waitress was very young and slow to bring out the chips and salsa which actually ended up coming with our meals. The food was fine but everything quickly went downhill the moment I asked for a refill. Keep in mind that my glass was literally filled  75% with ice! This is no exaggeration! ""Oh I'm sorry but that's gonna be an additional charge!""...I asked her could we make concession for this one occasion and she said no and that they would charge me. I asked for the manager who then came to my table and agreed to take care of me this one time and that next time it wouldn't be that way and I agreed. My waitress comes back to my table 15 mins later and asks do I still want the juice and I said yes! Then she said that her manager said she didn't agree to give me the refill. I then became flustered and requested that she come back to my table. This time a higher up manager comes wearing a collared shirt (typical rank status attire for restaurants). She then finally agrees to refill me and now I've been waiting 30 mins for a freaking refill of cranberry juice!!! This was a horrible experience considering the fact that it was only cranberry juice, not Patron or Belair champagne! When we arrived, I had to circle the parking lot and found the last parking spot wayyy in the back of the restaurant! This place is not hurting financially! However, they tried to make me feel as if their bottom line was going to be greatly effected by refilling my cup! What a sham! I'm a Network Engineer and paying for a refill is certainly within my budget but that doesn't mean that I will allow a place to mistreat me as customer! I will never patronize this location again!

We are greeted without a smile, without recommendations by Blanche about 5 minutes after being seated. I ask what the drink specials are and she basically throws the drink menu at me for me to look myself. We order House Long Island from the drink specials and water. She leaves and comes back about 5 minutes later w/o our drinks and ask are we ready to order. We order a burger and fries and the chicken skillet. Our drinks arrive and another server brings it to us w/o a straw. We attempt to stop another server to request for a straw who looked us in the eyes and said I will be right back but walks around to avoid where we were sitting. Our server comes back about 5 minutes later brings us straws and drops it off on the table w/o a word. We are finally brought our food about 10-12 minutes later after 2 tables were served before us after we were seated first. Food was hot and good. The server has yet to come back and fill up our waters or ask if we would like another drink, and we have yet to stop another server and request extra napkins and to fill our water. She comes back to the table and we just request for the  bill, she doesn't ask if everything is okay, how was the food or any dessert. When we receive the bill 2 minutes later we notice we were charged for the Ultimate Long Island. We tell her she rang this up wrong, she goes and speaks to Paula who said she will not take off the bill because we drank it. We requested to speak to Paula, she came and said well we should know that it was the Ultimate and not the House (although it was on the drink specials and I don't drink all the time), then said her server didn't ring it in wrong because they are trained not to but that we were lien. That her server wouldn't make an error. I was appalled that she felt her server walked on water especially with the crappy service along w/being called a liar. This is unacceptable.

The chicken was spoiled. when we asked to speak to the manager after waiting 20 minutes the manager did not show up and the waitress said he took the price of the meal off of the bill.

54,Keysha P.,"Jonesboro, GA",7,70,207.0,3.0,2017-05-28,"I mean hey this is a chain restaurant and I tend not to measure them the same way that I measure unique eateries.  TGI FRIDAYS is one of those places that is close to my apartment and I eat here once every couple of months and usually do not stop to do a review​ however due to them offering a new appetizer lineup I feel compelled to review them. Lately during my visits I have been enjoying the unlimited appetizers for $10..... just can't go wrong for all you can eat apps at this price.  I usually order the Jack Daniels boneless wings, mozzarella sticks, potstickers and as of recently​ the new meatballs that they have added to the lineup.  My last visit on Thursday, May 18th was uneventful for the most part. **Side note** stop forcing customers to order one appetizer at a time and stop refusing to give customers a to go box to take their food home.  If I'm paying for the food and get too full to finish it there I should not be hassled about getting a to go box to take the food that I paid for home.....all the staff is gonna do is throw the food in the garbage if I don't take it home anyway. I arrived alone as I had just reached the area after a long drive from work.  Upon entering I was greeted by a smiling hostess (always a good thing) and asked her if I could be seated at one of the small booths by the window.  She said yes but that the table needed to be cleaned and that I would need to wait about 15 minutes (3:30 in the afternoon, restaurant mostly empty so not sure why the wait to get the table cleaned, but ok).....fast forward 20 minutes later and I'm still standing at the door waiting to be seated. Finally she grabs a menu and walks me over to the booth but stops before I can​ sit down, now I'm being asked if I would like to sit at a table in the back by the restroom.  **Side note** I don't sit near restrooms when I eat at restaurants for obvious reasons! Told her that I want to be seated at the table that I had to wait 20 minutes for them to clean and asked her if there is some kind of problem.....that's when she told me that the server that normally takes care of this area had a family emergency and had to leave. **Side note** While stuff does happen to people and they have to leave work early the transition of staff (shift changes, emergencies etc.) should all be handled by staff so smoothly that the customer never notices the difference.  As a customer I'm coming to your establishment to enjoy the atmosphere, food and drink but don't want to be hassled about where I would like to sit especially when there are already people sitting in the same area..... somebody is taking care of their table so why not use common sense and ask them to cover the booth right behind the other customers?? Now as staff goes back n forth over this I'm beginning to get annoyed.... finally one server offers to cover the area and I can sit down oh but wait!  Nobody thought to clean the seat off so I had to ask for that to be done! Server was attentive, food was good and my glass was kept full with passionfruit tea.....Apps + tea total $13.49.   As I mentioned at the beginning of this review this is the level​ of service that I expect from a chain restaurant.   Left with a happy stomach and will continue to come.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-morrow,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
51,Keisha E.,"Atlanta, GA",154,76,320.0,3.0,2017-06-11,"I use to love Fridays, and desperately wanted to give them a 5 star but simply couldn't. Unfortunately this location seems to consistently be a two or three star restaurant. My boyfriend and his family decided to spend Valentine's Day at this location. The wait was no longer than 30 minutes which was nice especially since this was a holiday. Location: Located in Morrow, GA and the only Fridays accessible for both Henry and Clayton County residents. Nestled on Mount Zion near Publix, Carrabba's, and Taco Bell, this located is one of the top options for those who want a few drinks and a bite that isn't necessarily as upscale as Carrabba's may seem. Service: Tonight's service was actually one of the better times I've had at Fridays. Unfortunately there was a typical error with a few of our meals which did put a damper on the overall experience. Rewards Card: I do appreciate Friday's consistency with rewarding their frequent customers with a reward program called ""Give Me Strips."" For every dollar spent you receive 1 point.  The point system works in the following ways: 1. 50 points= Free Dessert 2. 80 points= Free Sandwich or Signature Burger 3. 100 points= $8 Off Food Purchase 4. 100 points= Free Chicken, Seafood, Salad, or Select Entree 5. 110 points= Free Stacked Burger 6. 150 points= Free Ribs or Steak Entree I did receive a free meal by using 100 of my points for the sizzling chicken and cheese meal. Which made this trip worth wild. One of the selling points for Friday's is this incentive. Pros: Location, Pricing, Desserts (Always Yummy), Drinks, Stripes Rewards Cons: Service is rarely consistently good, Food quality is a hit or miss.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-morrow,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28

I'll chalk this up to maybe then being short staffed in the kitchen and not wanting to be overwhelmed. The reason for the one star is the terrible attitude of the woman at the bar. We had to ask to be served after about 10-15 minutes of waiting (this was the case for mostly everyone who sat after us as well). We had to repeatedly ask her for things and she would rudely comment that she ""didn't forget"" and proceeded to forget lol I eventually asked another lady. They ran out of silverware at the bar and had to go to the back to get more, when she returned she said they didn't have any knives just forks.. wait what? How do you run out of knives?

My boyfriend and I came here excited for a date night last night and I would love to be able to give a nice honest review of their food, but unfortunately we weren't even able to eat any. We checked their hours on yelp before driving the half hour there, and saw that they were open until 11pm. We entered the restaurant at 9:15pm and stood in front of the hostess for nearly two minutes, with her eyeing me up and down before RUDELY telling my boyfriend and I that they are not seating anyone any longer and the kitchen was closed... SHE SAW US STANDING THERE FOR TWO MINUTES AND WASN'T DOING ANYTHING THAT ENTIRE TIME AND STILL DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING TO US FOR TWO MINUTES! We walked out the door livid, and went to the car to call and ask their hours directly. The person who answered the phone said the kitchen closes at 10... so tell me WHY we weren't seated if the kitchen closes at 10, the restaurant closes at 11, and we got there at 9:15? Not to mention that we could have just been going there for drinks and she didn't even bother to ask, she just turned us away. After calling while still waiting in the parking lot, we noticed lots of cars were still entering the parking lot and parking... Odd we thought, since they're not seating anyone any more. So we got out of the car and watched MULTIPLE groups of people (at least 5 different groups) enter the restaurant.... and guess what? Not one of them were turned away! So I went online to the actual TGI Fridays website to look at the hours for this particular location. Go figure it said they were open until midnight! At this point we were infuriated and stood outside the corner of the restaurant watching people enter for about 10 minutes in complete shock. The rude hostess must have seen this and came out the door and without saying a word, motioned for us to come inside. I said ""excuse me?"" And she said ""you guys can come in now"". I said ""I thought you weren't seating anyone anymore and that you were closing"", and she responded with some sort of mumble and ""you can come in"". We declined and left, hungry, disappointed and hurt. This isn't the first time we have been to this particular location and haven't felt welcome, but this has definitely been the most directed experience of hate.

Another party arrived shortly after me. They were asked how many immediately upon walking in. I was asked as an after thought. We were seated pretty quickly after being told there's a 20 min wait; so that was good. The waitress comes over introduces herself and ask for our drink order. Still going good at this point but that's where It stops. The drinks take a while to come out but I can see the bar from our seats. I can also see into the kitchen. The waitress takes our app and entree orders. More waiting. Apps come out and they seem ok. The food takes so long that we're pretty full from the apps that are almost completely gone. The food comes and my naan bread is burned. Toasted and burned are too different things. It was supposed to be toasted. My daughter asks how's she supposed to eat her salad. I tell her I don't know since we were never given utensils. The waitress hasn't stopped by our table since we put in the food order. I can't get anyone's attention get utensils and napkins. At this point I'm ready to go. I see two sets of utensils at the register behind me so I help myself so we can eat. I'm disappointed in the way my food looks but I decided to eat the filling of my sandwich; that was good. The waitress finally comes over so I ask for napkins. More waiting...for napkins???
