Every time I come in the manager Berry is working very hard and is very friendly making sure that everyone is satisfied. That makes his staff do the same. Wonderful bar tenders Jessica, Amanda, and Mason all very friendly and are the reason that I will continue to come here. This is the place to be for happy hour they have a great selection and great prices. Even a great place to take the whole family.

24,Jeff L.,"Lahaina, HI",66,36,160.0,1.0,2014-10-07,"Wow what a horrible experience!! Didn't even wanna give one star. Ordered ahi tuna on some fried chips. Chips were chewy as heck! Told the bar tender and all she did was bring me two more chips. Had to transfer the toppings myself?? WOW! Who does this?? Entree was brought out and yes of course it got worse. Broccoli was soggy and chicken under cooked. Once again I was polite and told the bar tender and all she said was she was sorry. Asked to have a baseball game put on the big screen, she acknowledged my request and went on with what she was doing. Must have forgotten given she had 2 people to wait on. Offered me a free desert for my horrible experience. Ya right! No way I'm coming back here. Most places wouldn't even charge you for bad food and service. Surprise!! Not here, I had to ask for my check and patiently watched the baseball game on my phone. It amazes me how places like this are managed and even stay in business. Good luck!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-nampa?start=20,,,,,
22,Joey B.,"Caldwell, ID",9,41,17.0,4.0,2015-02-27,"I've been here several times now and I now feel like I can give it a pretty accurate review. T.G.I. Friday's is a really good place to eat. I've had their burgers, chicken sandwiches, and several of their various appetizers. From all these different samplings and various visits, I can honestly say that I have only been disappointed by their offerings once. This disappointment came about because I found a hair in my entrée on one occasion. This was immediately addressed however, to the restaurants credit, and the item was removed from my bill and I was offered a replacement. I was told that it was an unfortunate common occurrence, which kind of made me wonder why they don't work on reducing this problem altogether. For this reason, I cannot justifiably give this place a perfect score rating. That being said, I know this place constantly strives to improve these kinds of issues. I know this because after eating here the past couple days, I've been able to listen to the meetings that the manager holds with his staff out in the dining area. Seems like there could be better places to address the ""violations"" the establishment has received with the staff, but it's nice to know they care enough to be working on it. For all these reasons, I feel a 4 out of five stars is representative of this place currently. I could reevaluate my review later after seeing how things continue to be on future visits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-nampa?start=20,,,,,

Every single day of the week they offer something for all taste, from delicious Coronaritas to the most delicious fruit tea shakers.

12,Mitch G.,"Polson, MT",2,147,2.0,1.0,2015-08-28,"Service itself is awesome. One star for the joke they call food. I was told by the staff that pretty much everything made here is from a can or a bag. Years ago when most Friday's were company owned every single thing was made from scratch, and I mean everything. Back then the food was amazing. Now it seems that nothing is made from scratch. They should be embarrassed to serve what they now call food. I honestly don't understand why people put up with the slop that places serve today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-nampa,,,,,

13,Jarrel W.,"Caldwell, ID",0,12,,1.0,2016-01-12,"You know, for some reason I was expecting so much more from T.G.I. Friday's, thinking it would be more like a Red Robin, Chili's, or Applebees, something along that line of food and quality. Here's the deal... Customer Service: 10/10, the waitress was friendly, attentive, and the other employees seemed to be cool as well. Atmosphere: 10/10, the decorations were interesting, the music they were playing was enjoyable. Food: Well... let's just say... the food was pure garbage. Issue #1: T.G.I. Fridays, why the hell is your food so gosh darn greasy?! All the food that came to my table (and I hate to go here) was covered in more grease than your bus boys acne ridden face! His face looked more appetizing than what came to our table. I mean, there was so much grease on this food, that was reminiscent of an oiled up body. This had more grease than even the greasiest fast food chain I know, and it was NOT appetizing. It was disgusting. Issue #2: Do you guys not put salt on or in your food? Literally everything that came to the table seemed to be bland. The burger had no meaty taste, the Mozzarella sticks had nothing going on, the Buffalo wings were uninspiring, the dipping sauces were meh. It was lifeless, and lacked seasoning. Issue #3: Do you guys cook with chef Mic or something (the microwave), or do you just let your food die in the window while you finish up the other items? The mozzarella sticks when they got to the table were warm, not even hot, the Buffalo Wings were once again, WARM, as if they went from freezer, to microwave, to table, and even my burger didn't seem to have any heat to it. Everything was just warm, nothing seemed to me to be fresh in any sense of the word. Issue #4: Portion Sizes, wow guys, you sure know how to talk up your food, and show it in the best light on the menu. Here I am thinking I'm going to get a big plate of fries, and a filling juicy burger, but Nooooo. My plate was a little bitty pouch of fries, and these teeny tiny little burger which was dripping in grease, and quickly became a lopsided mess when I bit into it. I don't think I'll come back here anytime soon for anything. I don't know if that's how most Saturday Afternoons are when it comes to food, but whatever Chef's were working that day should definitely be fired, and if not fired, a good ol' fashioned ass chewing from the boss is in order. Me and my family left, STILL HUNGRY. Your food is way over priced, and at  $76.00 or more, I could've went to any restaurant, got a huge plate of food, better quality, and left full, and satisfied. If this restaurant went out of business or closed down in the next year, I totally would know why.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-nampa,,,,,
21,Aundrea F.,"Nampa, ID",357,7,,5.0,2016-01-25,"Since we eat here every couple weeks, I thought I should post a review of this restaurant.  We go as a family of five and have been seated all over the place, there really is not a bad seat.  The hub prefers the bar to watch the games, but it's kid friendly there too.  Speaking of kids, they have a good selection for kids, and ALSO, one of my kids gets the $5 -$7 appetizers -usually the BBQ wings as his entree and loves them.  I almost always get the Chicken and sizzling shrimp, you have to try one of the sizzling chicken AND _____ dishes!  YUM.  The burgers and big and delish and the hub usually gets the ribeye which is pretty fantastic and tasty as well.  Occasionally, we order the WEDGE salad, which could be a meal in itself and is so yummy!  Drinks are good, all the sodas, teas, slushes, are very good and kept refilled.  Overall a great experience, and they usually mail out coupons for every quarter so you have incentive to go!  Don't forget to sign up for that- 20% off! or FREE appetizers.  Their warm pretzels, potstickers, and ALL their appetizers are delish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-nampa?start=20,,,,,

3,Jeanne C.,"Henrico, VA",29,10,1.0,3.0,2017-03-25,"For a few months, we went in every Wednesday night and sat in the bar. I had a couple cocktails with my meal and we loved the happy hour specials on appetizers. The last two times were unpleasant enough to make us ignore the 1,000+ points we've accumulated.  The first time we had a problem, my steak was a mangled mess. You could just look at it and see it wasn't right. The manager comped us and we shrugged it off as a bad night.  The next time we went in, we had to remind our server about the chips and salsa and we each ordered endless apps as well as our two entrees (the new burgers). The quality of the potato skins for our endless apps was ridiculous. I tweeted a picture to the official TGIFridays account and they actually wrote ""Yikes! That's not cool.""  The burgers were amazing compared to their old ones. The problem here was that, when I placed my order, I asked for mayo and mustard. When our server brought the burgers, I had to ask again for the mayo and mustard. Instead of going to get them immediately, she disappeared. Seven minutes later, I asked someone else to bring it to me. I got it right away. Too bad my delicious burger was cold by then :/ Maybe the server didn't like us since she was the same one when I got the bad steak. Our other meals were fantastic. The manager (Mason) is super nice, the greeters are great, and the waitstaff (especially Jolene) and the bald bartender are pretty cool.  It's too bad we had poor service and food quality the last two times we were there :/",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-nampa,,,,,

9,Matthew G.,"Nampa, ID",11,9,,1.0,2017-03-31,I was very disappointed with their endless apps deal I had a coupon 20% off our entrée the manager said I couldn't use the coupon. He said you can either order endless apps or use the coupon appetizers not both. If I'm paying for the 2 extra dollars for Endless appetizers I should be able to get the endless appetizers.

11,Jill A.,"Meridian, ID",7,1,,5.0,2017-04-15,"Let me say, despite a small issue, the service was fantastic, and as always, their burgers were great! After getting part way through my burger, I discovered that one of the paper separaters for the cheese hadn't been removed and was still in my burger. No big deal, easy mistake to make, I pointed it out and they made me a fresh burger. The manager even took the time to make it himself. I figured that was the end of it, but the manager then proceeded to offer me a free dessert for the trouble. I feel it wasn't necessary but I still appreciate it and enjoyed the free dessert. Our waiter was also enjoyable and pretty funny. Overall a great experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-nampa,,,,,

16,No N.,"Nampa, ID",34,1,,1.0,2017-06-17,"So we went to TGIF and I got The unlimited apps for 10$ and my husband got the usual entree. No where on the menu or their site or anywhere else that I found shows I needed to order and entree and the 6+ other times we went there and got the exact same thing we've never had an issue or been told differently....until today. We were in the middle of the 1st app and the waitress comes by and tells my husband ""oh you can't eat that I'll have to charge you an extra 10$"" as he was in the middle of a bite. Basically if I get the unlimited apps with HIS entree he cannot have a bite of mine. They brought out the 2nd app the guy asked anything else and I said yes your manager and I told him it was uncalled for for his waitress to tell him that in the rude policing tone she had and if he wants to continue that endless app promo he needs to make sure the 7 other people that helped us in the past are aware of the rules since none of them had told us differently. Then she brings the check out and she charged us 6$ for the 2nd app and I was like nope.  Manager came back out and blamed it on the computer.

0,John H.,"Caldwell, ID",14,120,2.0,4.0,2017-09-30,"According to Wikipedia, TGI Friday's was founded in NYC in 1965. That's 52 years ago. Wow! They must be doing something right. I had not been in a TGI Friday's for probably 30 years or so. The last one was in Santa Monica, CA. So, I was in Nampa, and hungry for a burger, went in. I ordered the ""Really Good Cheeseburger"" and, guess what? It was really good. The extra-crispy fries I ordered were just that, extra crispy. (I just don't like soggy fries.) The really good cheeseburger was washed-down with a strawberry lemonade, very good too. The order was taken by one waitress and another waitress delivered the plate to my table. Both of these women were quite pleasant, friendly, but not obsequious. You know, not ""trolling for tips.""  The atmosphere is corporate burger joint, if you've seen one, you've seen 'em all. By the time I got out of there, leaving a $3.00 tip, the bill was over $17.00, which is why I don't frequent these places. Yes, the cheeseburger was good. Yes, the fries were good. Yes, the lemonade was good.
