7,Ariel R.,"Pakenham, Australia",7,63,4.0,4.0,2012-10-27,"It hasn't been open for long but already this place has won a place in my heart (or perhaps stomach might be more apt). I adore the meals at this American eatery. The serving sizes are generous and the food is absolutely divine. In true American spirit they are classically lavish, fatty and huge. However everything I've tried has been undeniably delicious, particularly the Jack Daniels appetizer tasting plate (which I would recommend to anyone).  It should be noted however the prices are moderate to high. That said the lunch special (ranging from $10 - $16, including a refillable drink in some cases and only available weekdays) is particularly good value. Again the portions are large and food is sublime. It needs to be noted, furthermore, that, in my experience, the service had been superb. The waitresses are kind, attentive and, despite the fact the refills are free, quick to offer you a new drink when your current one is getting low. There is also a loyalty card, with decent savings, available for repeat offenders. This is certainly somewhere to try, particularly at lunch time after a long morning of shopping at the many outlets the new Fountain Gate has on offer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-narre-warren,,,,,
0,Scott T.,"Melbourne, Australia",73,121,51.0,3.0,2012-11-02,"We couldn't book a table for dinner before arriving and were told we would have a 30 minute wait. We hit the bar and had a table less than 20 minutes later. The walls are covered in pop culture junk, so it's not the classiest of places, but we got seated beneath a large toy Millennium Falcon so I was a happy boy. Happy hour was rapidly finishing once we got a table and for some stupid reason you couldn't get Happy Hour prices if you ordered your drinks from a waiter. This resulted in a ten minute wait at an almost empty bar for a couple of beers. When the manager (he wasn't dressed in the usual uniform so I'm calling him the manager) saw we were waiting he jumped behind the bar for our drinks, only they had no clean pot glasses so we scored pints for the price of a Happy Hour pot. If the beer was better than the Carlton Draught on offer that would score you an extra star on this review Mr Manager. The restaurant was very busy so service and food wasn't so fast, but I've just got back from America, so everything seems slow back here at home compared to there. When the food did arrive it was quite good, so I didn't mind the wait. I had the NY Strip with cheesy mashed potato and onion rings as a side. Onion rings can be pretty dodgy at times in Australia (comparing things to America again here) but these were damn good, as was the steak and mash. Oh, bring your ear plugs along too. Since this is a part of a chain of family friendly restaurants the staff will gather around a table to sing/shout a rather annoying song whenever it is someone's birthday. I just wanna eat my food guys, not listen to you embarrass the people at the table next to us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-narre-warren,,,,,
8,Adrian D.,"Melbourne, Australia",2,5,1.0,3.0,2014-08-23,This place has great food and so far I've only had good service and feels very American. The only reason I've given three stars is because the prices are super sized.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-narre-warren,,,,,
6,Susan G.,Australia,11,30,8.0,4.0,2015-01-18,"Love this place! Very American, friendly staff and big burgers !! Great for birthdays. The staff sing and clap at your table when they bring your birthday cake over ( take your own) and it's fun. The food is good and will definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-narre-warren,,,,,
4,Michael W.,"Melbourne, Australia",28,192,138.0,1.0,2015-06-25,"How things can change in 8 months. I remember coming here for Thanksgiving Day, being an American chain. The place was so busy, service was great, food was great.  We knew from past experience that this place got busy so decided to book ahead. We tried for a 6:30pm reservation, however they were booked out then, so booked for a 6:45pm sitting.  When arriving, it was surprisingly fairly empty with free seats everywhere. We were promptly seated and looking forward to a big meal. 15-20 minutes later, we are still waiting for someone to even come over & take a drinks order. We made the executive decision to high tail it out of there. We asked for the store manager to take our complaint. He just stood there like a little kid trying to avoid contact, while at the same time appeared to look for his wait staff. After not even trying to persuade us to stay with a free drink, I told him to shove his reservation and should be ashamed to be associated with the franchise.  I have been to many TGI Fridays around the United States and have never had to wait more than two minutes to place a drinks order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-narre-warren,,,,,
5,Frank D.,"Melbourne, Australia",1,32,6.0,3.0,2016-07-20,This place was ok but a lesser version of hogs breath.  Desserts were good but nothing amazing.  My order get slightly messed up but I did not complain since I am a wussy lovely man.  May need to try this one another time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-narre-warren,,,,,
3,Taryn S.,"Narre Warren, Australia",11,16,5.0,2.0,2016-09-27,I keep giving this place the benefit of the doubt but same problem each time I go in. Food takes too long and wait staff aren't very helpful.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-narre-warren,,,,,
2,Christine R.,"Carlton North, Australia",15,3,,1.0,2017-05-23,"Went out with two friends for dinner and came here. The waitress that was serving us seemed more bothered and annoyed to serve us, as if our table was an inconvenience. I ordered a glass of wine, which tasted fine but the stem and base were filthy, I could FEEL the grime when holding the glass. Now onto the food, we ordered the BBQ beef quesadillas, which were soggy, a large burger, which was extremely bland and flavorless, and a pasta that tasted like nothing. The most flavorful thing on our table was the chips. Waitstaff we're hard to get a hold of and we weren't the only customers visibly unhappy. Will not be back any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-narre-warren,,,,,
1,Craig R.,"Lynbrook, Australia",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-29,Terrible service and food - could not even eat main meal and service staff couldn't care less. Go elsewhere at fountain gate for better value and service or local restaurants with much better value and service. Staff said they would report the quality of food - we then witnessed her throw it in bin and couldn't care less paying customers weren't happy. Managers and staff saw the main was barely touched and could not care at all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-narre-warren,,,,,
