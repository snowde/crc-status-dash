51,Junior V.,"Maybrook, NY",3,84,156.0,2.0,2012-02-20,First of all this has got to be one of the worst TGIF i've been to. The portions are smaller than in other TGIF's and the staff is inexperienced. No curbside ordering or dedicated area to order outgoing meals. You must go to the bar where the bar staff appears to be bothered cause your ordering out. The waiting staff is good but the dishes are small for the price. I recommend fridays or applebee's instead.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newburgh?start=40,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248
57,Scott R.,"New Windsor, NY",9,47,3.0,3.0,2012-04-26,"Food is always decent for a chain restaurant.  Don't go if you are expecting a delicious meal, go when you want to get a beer and a burger.  I think that the service is always quick and the waitstaff is typically very nice.  Going the other night, we sat at the bar area which was loud due to the patrons at the bar.  I wanted to get the half-priced apps for happy hour so that is where we had to sit.  Waitress helped out because the beer I wanted they were out until the next day(however magically 20 minutes later someone came and they had it again???) , however she gave me a sample of another one.  I thought that was helpful because it made it easier to choose.  Only reason I rated 3 stars is because I am a little confused about their happy hour specials: $3 domestic drafts that does not include Sam Adams???  Last I checked they were brewed in Boston, however Coors Light, Bud Light, Bud and Miller light all were included in the domestic drafts.  I understand that Sam Adams could be called a higher end beer, however it is still a domestic draft.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newburgh?start=40,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38
55,athena z.,"Arlington, VA",0,30,,1.0,2012-05-20,This was the worst restaurant I ever been to. Our waiter took 20 minutes to get our order only after I had to get a hostess to get her the waitress was so rude and had a horrible attitude her name was Aimee. Then they served my mom a raw streak and told her to cut it and see if it was ok. Its called a meat thermometer I then asked to speak to the manager who never came just the food runner who knew nothing about food at all.

56,Holly D.,"Wallkill, NY",12,88,,2.0,2012-06-05,"I'm not really a huge fan of Friday's to begin with, but the loud music & sub par service makes this location even more unpleasant.  To begin on a positive note, I'll start with the good: -Black bean burgers are now offered.  So yay for having a veg friendly meal other than salads and some of the greasy appetizers on the menu.  -Drinks are pretty good -Hostess was friendly & rather apologetic about the wait, she got us seated as soon as she could Sadly, here's the bad: -The music is always loud to the point where you have to ask ""what?"" a zillion times to the person sitting right next to you or directly across from you while trying to have a conversation.  Forget about trying to talk to someone two or three people away from you.  -The last time I was there with a group of people, our waiter was more interested in being best buds with us then offering good service.  He took our drink orders, and it was something like 15 minutes before our drinks came with no checking up on us.  After our drinks came, it was at least 10 more minutes before meal orders were taken.  A few people at our table complained that they were starving (there were 7 of us), so he brought complimentary chips and salsa, but only enough for one side of the table.  My fiance & I ordered an appetizer, which did not come until AFTER our dinners came, and only because I reminded him of it.  Our waiter tried to make up for the poor service by being over the top friendly & giving our table three baskets of chips & salsa at the end of our meal, which did not make sense.   -During a previous trip to Friday's about a year ago, I ordered the Bruschetta Chicken Pasta minus the chicken due to not wanting a greasy appetizer or lame wedge salad and no other veg options on the menu.  I was served a dish of cheapo pasta with what tasted like doctored up canned tomatoes on it, and still charged the full price, which was a ridiculous $15 or something like that.  I complained, & someone was ""able to"" knock maybe $2.00 off the price.  For $15, I could buy some fresh pasta, veggies, & other ingredients and make a much better meal that would serve at least 4.   -Although the drinks were decent and we saw the prices on the menu, it still seemed silly to pay $4.00 for each virgin strawberry smoothie we ordered that just pretty much contained some type of sugary ""juice"" concoction & ice (my fiance & I each had one).  Sheez.  The only reason why I ever go to Friday's is the people I'm with wanting to go there & me being outvoted.  With so many local restaurants offering up creative fare with fresh local ingredients, and some decent chain restaurants in the area with better menus & service (such as Cosimos), I'll never understand why a place like Friday's would be someone's first choice for going out to eat and/or getting drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newburgh?start=40,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216

Road signs on 87 don't identify food options other than McDonald's, so we picked an exit at random and took our chances. My brother and I stopped at Friday's for lunch on a trip to NJ last weekend.  We bellied up to the bar and said no to all drink specials.  It was before noon afterall.    We did note other patrons enjoying some 22oz Bud Drafts though. I went for the Asian steak tacos (fancy!) while my brother had a cheeseburger w/ sweet potato fries.  I subbed a side salad for the rice that originally came with the tacos. The soft steak tacos were actually pretty good - each came with two grilled corn tortillas to sop up all of the juice/sauce.  Side salad was inedible (the straight from a bag type), but the tacos were sufficient.  I don't go to chains often, but when I do...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newburgh?start=20,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252

They did ask when the meal came if it was cooked correctly and we said yes because we had already waited so long we just wanted to eat and go.

Waited about 10 minutes before my drink order was taken down, and then it was about 5 minutes to actually get it. Server only had about 3 tables. If she can't handle that then she should stick to two or one. Got my drink, food order was taken down. Finished my drink and would have cared for a refill before my food arrived, but the server was no where to be found.  So a different waiter brought my food. I didn't bother to ask him for drinks since he must have his own tables and he was just helping our server out.  Then I realized I had no utensils. So I waited about 2 minutes before I went to the hostess to ask. She heard my request but told me to hold on while she sat guest. So I have food sitting on the table getting cold. 2 minutes later, I got my utensils. Finally sat down and started to eat. I'm eating my food with nasty watered down soda. While I'm almost done with my meal, the server comes by and asks if I would like a refill. Of course, I said yes and to bring napkins and sauce. I didn't get my napkins. She also seemed to want to rush me out the door towards the end. Food was excellent. Props to the cooks.

40,Stacy D.,"Marlboro, NY",0,2,,1.0,2015-07-15,"Had the worst experience ever at TGI Fridays in Newburgh last night.  It wasn't remotely busy, less than half of the tables and booths were full and quite obviously for good reason.  We waited to be seated for about 10 minutes because the guy at the door said he was going to clean a booth for us.  After 2 other parties were seated, one of the girls came and said she was never told where to put us so we were waiting unnecessarily since we were put somewhere that was already clean and available.  After being seated, it took almost 20 minutes for our waitress to come over to introduce herself and take a drink order.  We waited over 30 minutes for our appetizer to come out and another 10 for an order of fries.  The appetizer plates were soaking wet and smelled like bleach.  We had to ask for napkins to dry them off ourselves.  The entrees came out shortly after the appetizers were on the table and there were multiple problems there as well.  The reuben sandwich was so hard that the bread couldn't be cut through with a steak knife.  It must have sat under a heat lamp for at least 20 minutes after being toasted.  The pecan crusted chicken salad was ordered with no blue cheese and came out looking like extra was added and one of the cheeseburger came out burnt.  Our waitress didn't even come to check on our food until it was cold and not worth sending back since we were picking at whatever was edible.  We didn't see her again until we received our check (which we had to request from one of the other employees since our server was MIA most of our visit there, which was about 2 hours) When she saw it handed the to us she came over annoyed asking if we needed more time with the check knowing it was given to us less than a minute prior.  This was by far the worst dining experience any of us had ever experienced and we now have no intention of returning there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newburgh?start=40,2.6,2.6,2.6,1.924,2.6

I've been fucked over at this place more times than I've actually been fucked! It all started last year when I went with a friend dinner. We both got the jack Daniels burger and it was one of the worst decisions my life. As soon as you take the first bite, you instantly feel pain and agony. I would have rather gotten E. coli from chipotle than go through those severe stomach pains. I stopped going to Friday's until they brought back endless apps which we all know is the only thing worth actually going to this satan like chain restaurant.  The endless apps were exactly what you paid for. Their wings were a failed attempt to mimic the frozen wings you buy at the store like Purdue or Tyson. What I basically trying to say is that they were pure ass. McDonald's had better quality chicken than they did.  My most recent visit was by far the worst one. I went with my friends after a heavy night of drinking just looking to spend 10 bucks on endless apps. To our mere surprise they took them away. I don't know who the fuck makes those type of decision but I would really like to sit down and talk with them. I reread the menu about 4 times not being pleased by any of their pathetic meal choices. I figured I'd settle for some appetizers with their new pick 3 deals and man was it a rip off! 13 dollars for 10 minuscule   pieces of shitty appetizers.

I ordered a lunch combo special for $6.99 - a pretzel grinder with chicken, pepperoni and provolone. It came with an appetizer and I chose mozzarella sticks, and fries. When it came, it was minus the fries. I asked the server about it and she said she'd get them. I tasted a mozzarella stick and it was barely warm, the sauce was thick and gummy and not at all like the sauce they usually serve. When I got to the sandwich, which is served open-face, there was barely anything on one side of the bread except for congealed cheese...one slice of pepperoni and one morsel of chicken. When I questioned the server, she said that's how it's supposed to be, but if I wanted she could bring me another little piece of chicken. I declined the offer, tried to eat my sandwich which was cold, and ended up asking for a hamburger instead. The manager tried to help by offering to take twenty percent off the bill, which was nice, but I just don't think this location had its act together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newburgh,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

We were greeted promptly and seated.  The waitress came and we ordered.  Everything came in a timely fashion.  The food was good and the service was outstanding. The manager ""Cory"" made himself present and I asked him if he would be able to train the staff in Poughkeepsie to be as good as this location.  It's worth the bridge toll for me to come to this place rather them Poughkeepsie.  The place was clean, the food was great and the staff was outstanding.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newburgh?start=20,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

The food is the same as other TGIFridays, which is pretty good, but the service at this location is SLOW SLOW SLOW. The Newburgh TGIF seems to be a special case  We travel a lot and often seek out TGI Fridays because the food is good, they welcome kids, and the prices are ok. We've never been disappointed, except in Newburgh, NY - TWICE. We wont be back to give this location a third try and suggest that you don't either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newburgh,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
7,Chandra J.,"Dallas, TX",153,225,163.0,1.0,2016-08-23,"Was so disappointed in this TGI Friday's as the service was extremely slow and the food was disappointing. My friend and I came in and were quickly given menus, but the quickness ended after that. Our waitress did not return for over 10 minutes to take our drink orders. Then once she dropped off our drinks she did not return for another 10 minutes to take our food order. During this entire time we can see that our waitress is standing behind the bar chatting with her coworkers. She did not bother to check on us or get our orders at that time.  Finally she did return and get our orders and the foid that was brought out was so disappointing. I ordered a chicken with broccoli and spinach and my friend a burger with fries. The chicken was nice and tender and the spinach was cooked completely and seasoned with mozarella cheese, but that is where the flavor ends. My friends fries were overcooked and limp looking and the burger was very dry--he had to ask for mayo and ketchup to make it actually have some taste. After our waitress drops the condiments off she disappers only to return with our check.  I can remember when TGI Fridays was sooo amazing a few years ago. But, the past couple of years it has really gone down hill.  I would not recommend TGI Fridays for your dining needs. You are better off trying one of the new local restaurants in the area...do not go here!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newburgh,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
25,Sarah T.,"Highland Falls, NY",0,30,1.0,2.0,2016-10-15,I'm very disappointed in Fridays being I have grown up growing up here. I have seen a huge difference in the service and portions here. They changed their point system and they rarely give out free stuff anymore. Also their prices very high for what you get. I went a couple days ago and the appetizers have become half the size and the fries are now served in a paper cone that was not even filled. I know they cut back on portion size but I go to the one in Monroe and never does my cone look that empty. The manager told me it was portioned out but I no fries are free packed ... clearly they were being stingy. The food looked processed and I just feel for what we paid we my as well stay going to the competition where we get what we pay for and her a free app or desert everyone we visit. Chili's is a wayyyyyy better choice and I see why they are always packed vs Friday's which is empty. Don't waste your time with this chain they have gone down with customer service and serving / portion size... not worth the money... $45 for two burgers and a appetizer ... go get a 2/$20 across the street where you get what you paid for at half the price! Sad to see the change in Fridays but I gave it one last try...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newburgh?start=20,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
4,Josh M.,"Manhattan, NY",541,532,2449.0,3.0,2016-10-26,Ok. This location is hit or miss. There have only been 2 places I have been kicked out of in my life! Surprisingly! This TGI is one of them. I know a TGI Fridays. The other place was j los club in LA lol. I will explain what happened below.  So this TGI Fridays is at the corner of 17k and union Ave. across from palmerone farms. My grandfather grew up across the street. Kinda funny.  Anyways. The location is just like any other TGI Fridays. It gets super busy on the weekends with lines out the door. It's close to the airport. When I fly in. I sometimes get there pick up service. Service inside here is really hit or miss. Sometimes they have good deals like endless apps. Or $10 burgers or 2 for $10 deals. After a flight. Sometimes I just want to get something quick the to go helps out a lot.  I have had friends work here. As waiters I also had a friend I went to school with who bartended. They liked it no complaints.  The issue I had with this location is as follows. I was 21 years old. I was meeting a group of friends here @ 7pm for dinner and drinks on a Friday night.(first mistake) I had called a head of time to make reservations. The host said no problem reservations at 7 for 6 people. I came with one of my friends. When we pulled up. The line was out the door. My friend wanted to park close to the Fridays where We could see the car from our table because it was a sports car. People were taking photos of the car. When we circled around. So my friend pulled up front.  I went inside told them I had reservations at 7pm for 6. I also asked to speak to the manager about where I could park the car so we can keep a eye on it!  The girl tells me they don't take reservations. I laughed because I told her I spoke with her. She said she dident remember the conversation. I said how long will the wait be. She said about 1hr.... and 20 mins for 6 people. So I asked if I could speak to a manager. The manager came over. The first thing he tells me is we can't talk by the doors because we're blocking customers. Then over my shoulder. Sees the car out front. Asked me to hold on. Goes outside. And I see him telling my friend to move the car out of the front. My friend pulled away. But apparently just circled around. The manager came back in and told me they do take reservations but sometimes when there busy they can't hold them because of the amount of customers. I said ok I understand. Is there anyway you can maybe get us in before the 1hr 20 min wait. He replied. I doubt it. I'm going to see what I can do tho. He leaves. Then I see him outside talking to my buddy again about the car out front. So my friend pulled away again. I saw the manager come back in and about 25 mins goes by and he never comes back over to me. At this point the rest of my friends are here. Just hanging out in front of the Fridays with all the other people. I ask one of the waiters if he can get the manager. The manager never shows. Finally. I saw him in the back behind the bar. I go up to him and say any luck with out table. He said hold on one min. This time he comes back to me and said he has a table for 2 available. I told him I would take it. I was DD for the night. So they order a round of beers. My buddy parked the car outfront next to the sidewalk. Technically it's not a spot! Next thing I see is the manager walks up to our table and tells my friend he has to move the car or he's calling the cops to move it. I told the manager there are no spots up close and the car is very expensive. We need to keep eves on the vehicle. The vehicle was not blocking anything. Was not in a fire lane. Or blocking handicapped parking. It was on white striped lines. He said he was going to have to call the cops then. He leaves. Comes back and said the cops are on there way. I said ok let me know when they arrive. I also asked if we could order some apps. He said he doesn't have a waitress available at the moment. My friends were starting to get annoyed. I knew the game he was playing. I eat all over the country. Now that he wants to play a game. It became more personal for me. I saw him up front by the hostess. I go up to the hostess. The place is packed. I ask her if she could have someone over the our table for apps. She said no prob. Then I see this guy go over to her. I have no idea what he said. About 15 - 20 mins go by. Still no cops. So I go up to the manager and say. Ok man. I know you dident call the cops. We have don't nothing wrong. We aren't rowdy. I understand you guys are busy tonight. I'm trying to work with you here man. All these kids are locals. If you can't get us a table just say so. We will go eat at abblebees or something just let me know. He said he's working on it still. So I said you wont us anything but drinks because we have a car parked out front. I started laughing. I said if I pulled a Camry up and you asked me to move I would move it. This is a high end sports car worth a lot of money. I'm not trying to be a jerk.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newburgh,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28

23,Dennis B.,"Clintondale, NY",2,4,,1.0,2016-10-30,"I ate here on Christmas day in 2012. I ordered the grilled chicken breast with a baked potato. The potato was fine but when the inept manager came with the cook to bring out the food she insisted on thinking that the chicken was way overcooked even though it was perfectly seared like actual grilled chicken, she said she would bring another piece of chicken out and she apologized for ""burning"" it. She comes back out about 15 minutes later and brought me clearly undercooked chicken breast because it was white with hardly any grill marks on it. I just thought it would be a little more juicy than the first. Went home after what I thought was a nice Christmas dinner with my dad, next day I woke up with the most horrible pain in my stomach and very nauseous. I vomited and had diarrhea for 3 days.

11,Carl L.,"New Windsor, NY",10,6,12.0,1.0,2017-02-06,"Garbage tastes better.  Your menu is not a true reflection of the pathetic food that you serve and your crappy food is amazingly overpriced.  I used to LOVE TGI Fridays, but apparently, there are new people in charge of the menu pricing and items because your items have gone south.  In a very bad way. My 'stacked burger' which I thought from the picture would be too big to bite, was the size of a McDonalds double that I can buy for less than $1.50  yet yours is $13 FUCKING dollars. This chain needs a wake up call.   When your crappy servers serve up your crappy food it tends to make for a crappy experience which is why all your stores have a less than 3 star rating.

Took an hour to get food (granted there was 12 of us), and all apps came out with entrees even after we asked for them before, ya know, when apps are supposed to come out. The server  was ok, but obviously rushed and flustered as he had 2 large parties and several other tables. We saw maybe 3 servers and about 5 bussers. It was mid lunch rush, so some service could be excused, but half of us had places to be afterwards, and had to scarf down our food. We had to flag down our server for the check, and some of the appetizers did not come to the table until AFTER we got the check. Also, they put a recommended tip percentages and amounts at the bottom of the check, with 20%, 15%, and 10%, which were all calculated wrong with several dollars added to the actual recommended amount. Lastly, the bathroom was extremely unsanitary, with toilets that wouldn't flush.

FIRST VISIT  I am with my kids and it took 18 minutes before the waitress took our order. We were one of 3 or 4 tables, it was a slow weekday and it was between breakfast and lunch. It took 48 minutes before I got my drink. I forgot exactly, like an hour and 5 minutes before my kids got their drinks, yet it took less than 30 seconds to get my refill. My kids said leave the order lets just get out of here but by 1:20 in we got our APPS!!!! That's all we ordered and it took that long!  It took 20 more minutes to get the next refill and 18 I believe for the next refill, not sure about the last time. It was so long between servings that I thought it was a new meal! She apologized several times to me. Ok, stop apologizing and start showing us service. It was like she just didn't like us. She spent a lot of time talking to an older couple and walking past us continually. Hello? So I gave her a huge tip Sounds crazy, but I hope she realized that she stunk. Her attitude was discourteous and unprofessional and it's like these people really just DO NOT CARE! What happened to caring and professionalism? It went out with the horse and carriage... SECOND VISIT (You'll like this one) The guys brings us to our seats and says your server will be right with you. He walks to the end of the bar, grabs some menus and walks back to us and says hi, I will be your server tonight. Cute. But when our orders came out they didn't have what we ordered. My friend asked for sauce that didn't come. So we waited and waited and waited, finally he said, I have to eat, I can't wait. So we both ate completely and then the guy brought the sauce over. It took TWO FULL HOURS before we were done. People just don't care. I am getting tired of going out. We go to Franks Pizzeria in Middletown by Home Depot because they are the only ones who consistently get it right. Everywhere else I go I have been seemingly disappointed by the service, not necessarily the food but definitely by the apathy and disgruntled nature of the servers. They just don't care, and Fridays in Newburgh has been no exception the pathetic laziness which has crept into the serving industry. So, you may get your food, you may not, you may have to wait a very very very long time. It's up to you I will probably be back But I do NOT expect good service; I EXPECT LOUSY SERVICE and that's a shame...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newburgh,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

The bartender didn't even tell me her name was rude as can be. She Totally just wanted to go home. Had a Latin boy with short curly hair washing dishes but yet she let me sit for a While then I asked for two drinks in order to close out and make things easier. She then said she isn't allowed to serve me two drinks. So I ordered one at time. Made me wait for a soda in order for her to enter he tips in computer. She began serving employees Sambuca after she told me It was last call. I tipped her 10 on 25 and she still had nothing nice or even a smile nothing. Heard her telling the dishwasher she should  have done last call at 830 and sat and talked with the employees. I asked for another thru the Latin boy  since she was pouring sambuca and was told NO WE ARE CLOSED! WORST SERVICE HORRIBLE WILL NEVER RETURN.
