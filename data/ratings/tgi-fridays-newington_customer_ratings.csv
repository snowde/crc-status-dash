16,Andy M.,"Concord, NH",0,4,,4.0,2012-08-02,"I eat here quite often!  Anyone of the Jack Daniels items from the grill are fantastic choices.  Sometimes a bit pricy based on the style of restaurant.  On my most recent excursion I tried the Jack Daniels Salmon and Jumbo Butterfly Shrimp!  It came in at $17 but was very good.  It comes with two sides and a Cajun cornbread.  I asked for mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.  Absolutely fantastic.  The salmon is grilled with slightly charred edges while the jumbo shrimp is a bit messy.  It too was grilled but still in the tough outer shell which had to be removed.  The cornbread was my only disappointment.   I went again the following night for Jack Daniels Chicken which consisted of two grilled chicken breasts glazed with JD's glaze. I once again paired it with mashed Potatoes and steamed broccoli.  They never seem to disappoint.   Both of these visits were To-Go pick up orders, so I cannot comment on shutdown service.  Otherwise however the food is always fantastic!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newington,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.736

28,Stefanie G.,"Amesbury, MA",0,27,2.0,1.0,2013-01-28,"Another 1 star.  sigh..... So maybe we were between shifts and it WAS a Sunday, but really?  We were the only people at the bar with 2 bartenders and it took 5 minutes to be acknowledged.  Our drinks were served promptly and we chose the pretzles as a quick snack but we recieved plates and that's it.  We had to use cocktail napkins!!!!  No one ever even checked on us! I could go on and on and on but I'll keep it to the highlights.  First was the cocktail napkin thing.  Then the bathroom was BOGUS!!!!  Smelled like sewer, dirty...I didn't even wash my hands, I broke out the hand sanitizer because I had to get out! As we were leaving hubby had to use the restroom (urinal was hanging off the wall he said?) so I hung out out front just to see if anyone would notice me.  As hubby was walking out, finally a girl sauntered over to me to ""seat me"".  Couldn't get out of there fast enough....will never go back there and probably won't go to another Friday's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newington?start=20,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002
24,Gregory P.,"Danvers, MA",70,325,55.0,2.0,2013-01-28,"I hate chains. Friday's prices are becoming absurd and their portions just keep getting smaller and smaller.

26,Sandi Z.,"Exeter, NH",0,21,,1.0,2013-03-11,First time there.  Should have known it was awful.  No cars in the lot.  Waitress messed up the order.  Sodas with no ice.  Brings me a plate with 3 chicken fingers on it.  Forgot the fries????  Bill even wrong.  People at the next table were served uncooked entrees.  Took so long to get everything straightened out I was tired.  Once a week my husband and I got to lunch.  Never here ever again!  When I wrote to the home office about the mess they seemed to think I was lying.  Oh and light lunch took over TWO HOURS cause of the staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newington?start=20,,,,,

17,Pat M.,"Portsmouth, NH",22,9,5.0,2.0,2014-08-01,"Ok.  It's a Friday night (not a pun) at 7:30 mid summer and the restaurant is less than half full, yet a party of 2 has to wait 15 minutes. 2nd time in two weeks this has happened and the parking lot is mostly empty. The staff is not up to the standards that tgi has been known for.  They tend to be chatting with each other or spending a enormous amount of time with guests that are not their tables.  As for the food, it has gone downhill while the price has gone up. What use to be a fresh jack Daniels burger is now a frozen flavorless piece of ??  The bread was toasted but not the freshly baked bun it was just a few months ago. Very disappointing for a place we use to go to at least twice a month.  No wonder the chain is struggling.  Hope they figure it out soon and get back to basics.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newington,,,,,
23,Stephanie V.,"York, ME",41,326,132.0,1.0,2014-08-18,"I used to work and live local where I frequented this location.  I convinced my husband to go for lunch seeing that we planned on being in vicinity.  I was excited to have a meal I used to love and knew how good the restaurant was.  What a let down.  Epic fail.  While the staff are very nice, they have 2 speeds....slow and more slow.  The restaurant had 2-4 tables with people when we arrived and only 2 more tables filled after we arrived.  So, the reason behind the lack of attentiveness and why it took 40 minutes for the food to arrive is beyond me.  We didn't receive the sweet potato fries we requested, either.  I won't get into the details of what an employee was saying about the fries we did receive, but let's put it this way, he went out of his way to make us feel like we were scamming for extra fries instead of legitimately bringing to their attention that we asked and paid more for the sweet potato fries.  You either take the fries or you leave them regardless of what would happen to the wrong fries, because you have to throw them away, anyway.  The approach lacked class and professional behavior.  What's worse is that my usual favorite meal was a huge disappointment.  The quality was substandard.  The burger was good, though.  I took my sandwich home and gave it to my dogs.  The regular French fries changed, too.  Pretty good, but not what they used to be.  Oh, well. No more special visits for us.  A party of two in an almost empty restaurant at lunch time on a Sunday should not take an hour and a half.  I also shouldn't have to ask for more soda when a glass is empty when the food is just brought over.  Again, nice people, but not nice enough to waste my time and money.  Too many cons rather than pros.  Now I know why they have the endless appetizer promotion going on and mailed out coupons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newington?start=20,,,,,
1,Deirdre C.,"Danville, NH",70,185,1042.0,5.0,2014-11-16,"It's been quite a long time since we've been to a T.G.I.Friday's, and never this one. It was early on a Friday evening, and the place was busy (good sign) but no wait. The hostess led us to our table, through every part of the place shy of the kitchens. It was a bigger restaurant than seemed from the outside.  Our server, Devon, came over pretty quickly, and was very attentive throughout our meal, refilling DH's drink more than once without being asked.  We opted to start with the pick three appetizer sample tray. I didn't try the Tennessee BBQ boneless wings, but the pot stickers and fried green beans were really worth the calories! ;) For mains, DH had a standard fare bacon cheeseburger. He definitely enjoyed it. I went for the turkey burger. It was a far bigger patty than I imagined and very juicy. The seasoned fries were simply some salt and pepper, not the icky coated seasoning. While the dessert options were tempting, neither of us had room. All in all, we were pleasantly surprised at such a good meal, for a reasonable price.  My only complaint was that it seemed the air conditioning was on in the washroom, or the heat wasn't working! When it's barely above freezing temps, the outhouse experience indoors is less than desirable. I'd almost deduct a star for that, but it was clean, so I'll let it slide. This time. ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newington,,,,,

4,Beck C.,"Portsmouth, NH",114,79,10.0,5.0,2015-04-10,"Another chain restaurant, sigh.  I wanted to hit a local spot today but I was overruled by my husband who wanted Friday's French Dip.  But I didn't mind too much, because Friday's is fun. I haven't been here in ages.  They had baby back ribs on the menu - a little heavy for lunch, but that's just another thing I haven't tried in a long time.  I don't think I've had baby back ribs since I lived in Houston where you can get the BEST ribs at a restaurant boringly named ... Houston's. How did they taste at a chain?  Delicious.  Not as good as Houston's but they were as described - fall-off-the-bone tender.  At a chain restaurant.  Go figure.  They were great!  My pants are still unbuttoned.  I don't even know why I'm reviewing Friday's.  Everyone has been here, you know what it's like - and they're all the same.  My gripe?  The silly stuff all over the walls.  Guys - it's old.  Change it up. This restaurant motif has run its course - it's not the 90s anymore, and all I can think about is the annoying waiter with his flashy 'Bling' (or, what did he call it?) in the movie Office Space.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newington,,,,,

Our waitress was very nice however she spilled more than one drink on our friends, not to mention the drink spilled on top of their phone. We ended up changing tables because it was soaking wet. 15 minutes after that happened a boy proceeded to throw up right behind us and the whole area smelled putrid. Would not go back.

19,Brittany B.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,,1.0,2015-06-21,"I'm typically not one to give bad reviews but this is in hopes that a change is made. My fiancé and I stopped for a quick lunch today. The waiter took forever to initially stop or even acknowledge us, followed by sub-par food with no follow up to see how it even was, I asked for no mayo on the sandwich and it was on there- didn't check to make sure it was correct, and when the check was given we waited at least 10 minutes for the guy to even come get it. On top of that, as we left a young woman co-worker did not even acknowledge we were leaving and completely ran into my fiancé and myself. It was extremely rude and put a cherry on top leading to this review. Typically TGIFridays is a great place we enjoy going to but your staff made me never want to return to this specific location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newington,,,,,
10,James G.,"Kingston, NH",265,49,4.0,1.0,2015-07-04,"Went here for lunch on the Fourth of July. Let me start by saying the host and waitress were really nice. The food on the other hand wasn't good at all. I got a burger because usually that's a safe bet anywhere. Well it wasn't cooked right, wasn't hot and tasted like a frozen burger. The fries where cold. My friend got the spinach flatbread and gagged because of the intense garlic flavor. Really disappointing in all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newington,,,,,
14,Andre B.,"Ottawa, Canada",0,2,,2.0,2015-07-22,"When we went there, the place was almost empty. All the tables in the dining room were vacant and there were 3 vacant booths and the guy in front to, d us there was a 10-15 minutes wait. There was no one waiting in front of us or after us.  Then a group of 10 people walked in, without any reservations, and they got seated within 5 minutes, while we were still waiting. The waiter told us they have to seat big groups first, no matter when they walk in.  Sounds fair. Not.  The,  since we went there to try the $10 apps, the waiter told us we could only choose one appetizer per person, which kninda sucked. And there's not a lot of choice. And one of the order  of wings, the ghost pepper wings, which is actually really hot, they messed up and brought me th regular buffalo instead. And it took a long time after we finished eating all the apps for the waiter to come back to see us.  All in all a pretty disappointing experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newington,,,,,
11,Keith P.,"Portsmouth, NH",54,7,,5.0,2015-08-26,"Like most yelpers, reviewing a chain restaurant seems pointless as everyone is usually familiar with them already. But I have to give Friday's props. I've been going here since I was a kid and have never had a bad experience. I'm a burger guy and although I'll usually choose wild willys or lexis to get my fix, Friday's is always a great place to get a great burger. The jack Daniels burger is my favorite but looking forward to trying the American stacked one next time.

First off, the bathrooms were disgusting and smelt horrible, the rest of the restaurant was dirty and the music was so loud that I couldn't even hear my husband who was sitting across from me. There wasn't a lot of people there even though it was about dinner time.

0,Jaden B.,"Rollinsford, NH",79,19,,3.0,2016-02-05,"Meh. We actually like the food they serve here; they have some unique options (the green beans are yummy) and are always running a special. Or ten.  The problem with that is that the waiters never seem to know how to apply the specials, and while they advertise them ALL all over the place, none of them combine, or you will often get told they are only available in the bar (after being served) even if they don't say so on the ads. The result being that even though I pretty much always have a coupon for them, often we end up paying full price anyway.  The atmosphere in here is a bit too dark. Service is usually mediocre (although one time in the bar we did have great service from one new guy) which is a shame because the location is great and we would probably come here more if they could figure out which promos they are running and how, and maybe brighten it up a bit. Even though we enjoy the food, we always leave here feeling like something is lacking...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newington,,,,,

We are here on a Saturday night and there Is hardly anyone here. The food is generally good however tonight I ordered the Parmesan Chicken and the chicken was horribly overcooked (it was rubbery).

2,Kristie A.,"San Jose, CA",34,44,11.0,2.0,2016-05-03,"I went with my grandmother for an early dinner (4:30pm). We waited for over 5 minutes at the hostess stand, and I finally went over to the bar to ask for assistance in getting a table. We were seated and our waitress seemed quite disinterested (even though there were only a handful of people in the entire restaurant).  She took our drink order, forgot the lemons for water, and took our food order. After the food came out, she didn't ""check in"" with us until we were about almost done (good thing we didn't need anything else...). I asked for a refill on my drink (lemonade) and took quite some time to bring it out. Water glass was also empty. The food was meh - on par with expectations.  When the bill came, I was double charged for the drink - even though the menu stated included refills, and when I asked for a ""refill"", not ""another"", she did not advise me of an additional charge. I was also charged an exorbitant amount for the drink. After checking online, looks like it should have been $0.99 for the ""slush lemonade"". That seems a little low - I expected ~$3+. From my recollection, I was charged ~$8.75 each ($17+ for 2). This was NOT an alcoholic drink, but a lemonade... (source:   and the restaurant's website) We waited for over 10 minutes for the waitress to come back and clarify the bill, which she didn't... so I left her the lowest I've ever tipped in my life and walked out.  At least PRETEND to care about your patrons... especially when your pay revolves around being tipped. I hope the young girl takes this as a life lesson. I normally tip generously (even if only average service) since I know how significant tipping is for most waitstaff's pay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newington,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84

The place was completely empty except for maybe 2 other couples. It took our waitress 10 minutes just to come over and get our drink orders, then another 10 minutes just to get a fountain drink. We finally ordered our food, which took 30 minutes to get to us. My grandmother's food was charred, mine looked like it was heated in a microwave. Later, my mother found an ant crawling on her glass. Let's just hope it didn't come from the salad she had. I looked to my left and the windowsill was COVERED in cobwebs, as if no one had dusted in weeks. Really gross place, and bad service to boot.
