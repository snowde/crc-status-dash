3,Kisha A.,"Virginia Beach, VA",64,61,256,4.0,2016-01-12,Located inside Robinsons Galleria which is connected to the Holiday Inn I'm staying at made this restaurant very convenient. Had dinner with a couple coworkers and wasn't disappointed. We arrived at 6pm and seated immediately. Service was quick and all the waitresses were very friendly. I had the pork adobo which was really good. I didn't expect such good adobo from a TGIFridays but was pleasantly surprised. Coworkers had ribs and the chicken quesadilla which they both said were really good as well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-no-title-4,,,,,
2,Dennis Carlson L.,"Manila, Philippines",62,281,1520,5.0,2016-03-25,"Two dishes I love at Fridays: Ball Park Nachos and Fish Tacos (evolved from Fish and Chips). I will order this any chance I get. Third on my list would be that tender, succulent, juicy pork chop. I love Fridays (the resto, I mean). Before, I had few opportunities to dine because of its price. But with the Bistro Card, I can dine more at any of the Bistro restaurants, well, 20% saves a lot of money. With more opportunities, I have more reasons to try their new dishes.  The other two non-food dishes I like: Fast, friendly, efficient service from the staffs, and big big servings that gives an opportunity for friends to meet and bond.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-no-title-4,,,,,

0,Kenton F.,"Newark, NJ",120,114,129,4.0,2017-09-13,They get 4 stars for the quality of the drinks and service. The bartender pour em riiiiight! The food was eh not bad but nothing to rave about. I had the ribs the first time then a club sandwich the second time. I still can't find ribs that I like outside of the south west other than my own.  What I didn't like was my Discover card wasn't accepted there like the rest of the mall they need to work on that.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-no-title-4,,,,,
