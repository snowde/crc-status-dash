But it's hard to have dinner there because once the food gets delivered, and the bartenders are busy making drinks for the other patrons,  they don't come around again and you can't get  ketchups, ranch, another settings, napkins, h2o, etc.  Drinks are pretty strong, thumbs up! Spinach dip is my usual.  I had the spareribs and shrimp - too dry.   I recommend drinks and appetizers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-northridge?start=220,2.24,2.24,2.24,2.508,2.24

280,Henry C.,"Torrance, CA",3328,403,8.0,3.0,2012-01-23,"Quick, short, and sweet review for all these chained establishments... Who have not heard of TGI Fridays?   I don't typically go to TGIF but since Souplantation was closed for some reason we've decided to eat here instead.... Deals:  GREAT!  (2 for $20) deal comes with one sharing appetizer, 2 entrees, and one sharing dessert.  It's quite a bit of food for the price nowadays! Food:  Meh...  It' just regular food so you don't go starving to death and it's nothing to hammer home about... Here is what we had... -- Fried Green Beans :  Not much flavor to the batter... just literally fried string beans -- porkchop... quite salty in my opinion... I'd probably do it next time without the sauce -- Petit filet... simple flavored... just a piece of meat.. -- Mash potatoes:  How come this is one dish that is usually the best in a mediocre restaurant?  Perhaps it's simply too difficult to screw it up? Service was friendly & attentive so I gotta give that to them!  Food... not so exciting... that totally reminds me why I ""rarely"" come to TGI Fridays... If you are in the area and looking for a great deal... give this place a shot... if you are looking for a culinary adverture for your tastebuds... I'd suggest you look it up on yelp...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-northridge?start=300,2.28,2.28,2.28,2.412,2.28

307,Joanna Y.,"Lawrence, KS",182,231,73.0,3.0,2012-02-04,"Fridays is a funny thing... It is pretty average in every way. Food is hit or miss, service is hit or miss, drinks are hit or miss. Here's why: Food: there are some things on the menu here that I really like- most of the appetizers, a couple of the salads are decent.  Fridays has a line of appetizers and such that are in the freezer section of the grocery store- I don't think there would be any difference (in taste) between eating  the food in a restaurant and eating it at home since it usually tastes reheated anyway. But it cures a potato skin craving rather quickly.  Service: waitstaff is usually quite friendly. They often get flustered when it's really busy and forget things, but they don't give customers attitude. I've experienced a few bartenders here though thinking they're the shit since they pour your drinks. Reality check:  this is TGI Fridays, not a high end bar or tavern.  Drinks: their mixed drinks are decent. I like the Down Home Punch. My only issue is their selection of Happy Hour beers. Nothing good. Bud and Miller and that is about it. Water is free, I'd rather get free water than spend the Happy Hour Price of $4 for something that tastes like brown water from Indiana.  All in all, I keep coming back here and I generally leave satisfied.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-northridge?start=340,2.24,2.24,2.24,2.348,2.24

Service at the bar and during late night happy hour, not even close to satisfactory. They lag it a lot and they try to redeem themselves by making jokes, but you kinda just laugh out of pity.  Anyway, food is good. It's not always hot, usually just warm enough, but I do enjoy the fried green beans.

The place was packed when I walked up to it and I was greeted instantly by the pretty girls upfront who tried to help me find my party. I also witnessed them try to help another confused member of my eventual group. So, customer service is pretty awesome here, not to mention that our group kept getting checked up on repeatedly through the night by waiters, asking for more drinks, more food..etc. I had a gin and tonic, it was not that strong and watered down pretty fast... but it was free. so. there's that.

301,Beatriz U.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,9,1.0,1.0,2012-05-29,This TGI Friday's in particular gave us very bad service. They sat us on our table in a pretty decent amount of time but after that it took for ever to have somebody come to offer drinks even. Until I had to stop a waitress passing by and ask her who would be taking care of our table. After all this she helped us out herself because our waitress had gone for her lunch break!!!

So here I go.... If you don't like what I have to say TOO DAMN BAD!! Don't bother sending me a private msg or a compliment on MY own opinion in regards to any given place. I WILL BLOCK YOU, I could care a less about ANYONE'S opinion about MY own opinion. ok now to the review.... So a few weeks ago I visited this place just because, I wanted to take my  mini me out for dinner and the only place I could think of was THIS one. Oh! it was the night of the game right before the FINAL game (the hockey game for the stanley cup) anyway this place was PACKED! I mean the whole bar area was full and I was lucky enough to get there and be seated without having to wait. The waitress was very pleasant and she smiled every time she came by our table. I had this one appetizer plate with cheese sticks, potato something with cheese, and wings. I asked for the wings to be SUPER SUPER HOT (whatever this place considers hot) anyway I didn't burn my lips and my tongue didn't get numb BUT I did enjoy my food :) of course I devoured the entire thing by myself NO PROBLEM and honestly speaking the wings had a really good kick to them! Now for the major PLUS points: my mini me fell in love with this place. I don't know exactly what or why, I mean she did finish her chicken fingers and her fries which doesn't always happen; but still she really really became a fan. This particular visit went well. SECOND visit: Service was EXCELLENT although the wings weren't half as good as the time before and the clam chowder soup taste like shiiiet, they did change it for us for the broccoli and cheese type soup which turned out to be really tasty. I have nothing bad to say about my experiences here, and even the bathrooms are clean which is always a good thing. I don't give it a 4 star because I'm not a fan, but who knows maybe they will WOW me next time and I will bump them up a star.

So I got one. Once the bill came I noticed it was more than $5 so I complained.

This time our waitress started out strong while we waited on my dad. Then when we finally placed the order the problems started...she could not tell us what kind of meat the ribs were on the sampler..we can't have Pork so it was really important.  After waiting almost 40 min to get our food and having to ask another waitress for something I wanted to add. The food showed up and it turned out the ribs were Pork ribs!!! Found out when they were served at our table. Then our waitress disappeared again. We had to track her down when we wanted something.  On top of that my meal and my fathers meal were supposed to have Rice Pilaf, but they served them with Jasmine rice and nobody told us. Apparently the manager was aware they didn't have any Pilaf also.  When we finally got the check we couldn't believe it , My wife returned her ice tea but was still being charged for it and my kids drink , which was supposed to be free was being charged as an adult size. When we brought it to their attention, it didn't get fixed and  the Mgr didn't even come out. He sent another waitress with some discount cards and an apology. We refused the cards and the Mgr still didn't come out. We even refused free desert still no Mgr. We had to ""ask"" for the Mgr to come to our table because all he did was take $10 off our check even though we were being overcharged by $7. This meant we got a $3 discount for the long wait (2 + hrs) the Pork at the table, wrong food on our plate and horrible service....after we spoke to the Mgr he offered to adjust the bill for the correct charges then give us 50% off. Instead he just takes 50% off the un-adjusted bill..the Mgr is clueless, no customer service...WE WILL NEVER RETURN THERE AGAIN.....even when when I told him we were not coming back he said ""OK"" like it no big deal to loose a family of 5 I think his name us Arturo or something like that. He was very poorly dressed for a Mgr not looking professional at all either. I am very surprised that TGIF would have a Mgr like this on a Saturday night.  To top it off he lied to us. he told us that he had the waitress in his office and was speaking to her about what happened but when we were pulling out she DROVE back in and got out of her car and walked back into the store...HMMMMM ??

He didn't want to give us our final receipt, so he had someone else bring it to us and then ignored us when we called for a manager. AND to top it all off, the manager didn't care.

256,Cody Q.,"Simi Valley, CA",40,17,8.0,1.0,2013-06-23,"Went there this last Friday and received some of the worst service I have ever had. First off our waiter was completely drunk and couldn't even remember our drink order. He kept stumbling all over himself and around the restaurant. I ordered a beer and after finishing my first drink our food still hadn't arrived. Our waiter took forever to come and offer refills or another drink so I had to go most of my meal without something to drink. In most restaurants a waiter will come when the food is served and ask how everything is - our waiter never did. If he had maybe I wouldn't of had to wait for another drink. During our whole stay he only came to our table three times. I understand if a place is busy it's hard to stay on top of all your tables, but if you are serving other tables in the same area and keep walking by a table and seeing empty drinks it doesn't take too much effort to ask if we want refills. When our waiter finally brought out ticket one of my friends was over charged for her meal. When we brought it to his attention he argued with her and then took the ticket and said he would look into it even though we knew it was the wrong amount. When he returned it his response was, ""It's only $2 off."" The amount wasn't the issue it was the ideal of being over charged and he never apologized about it. We asked him to split it three ways and told him which card went to what meal. When we received the final separate checks all three tickets were for the wrong amount and my card was charged twice! After the poor service and frustrated with the waiter we asked to speak to the manager. When he came I told her that my card was charged twice and when I tried to explain that all of the charges were incorrect he just interrupted us and didn't even apologize for the inconvenience. I even told him that overall the service was horrible and instead of apologizing he took the ticket and said he would take care of it. When he brought back the tickets after correcting it he asked if we wanted a free dessert or if we just wanted to ""hang out"" It didn't even seem like he cared that we had a horrible experience there and offered little to correct the issue. I don't see how the staff can wait on their tables there - there was another waiter in the same area and the whole time we were there (for about a good hour and half) he just stood by the booth next to ours and talked to his friends. I don't know how he served all his tables when he was at his friend's table most of the time. The bus boy came to clear the table while he stood near it and chatted with his friends. When the bus boy mentioned something to him he yelled, ""Just write me up then!""

294,Laura Z.,"Arleta, CA",504,284,728.0,2.0,2014-01-06,I have never been a fan of big chain restaurants. Coming to TGIF is yet another reason why. Yes they have great deals on food especially during happy hour but honestly the happy hour choices are not the best. I rather have something from the regular menu. But even then the quality of the food is horrible. I have been to this location twice now. The first time I had the orange chicken plate ( I forgot the real name of the plate) It was okay I got it because it was under 500 calories. The second time I had the flat bread BBQ pizza which was not that great. It was hard and flavorless. I tried the fried mozzarella and its good. BF had the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was horrible and hard to bite. The buffalo sauce was almost non existent. I have heard great things about the Jack Daniels selection so I might come back to try some of that stuff. One thing I wont complain about are the prices and service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-northridge?start=300,2.52,2.45,2.45,2.152,2.478

The service like other comments here is terrible. It is a chain Resturant so don't have high expectations. But for all the bad reviews it is packed at happy hour I imagine this is why the management does not care about improving their reputation.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-northridge?start=340,2.52,2.46,2.46,2.12,2.484

I finally dusted it off and called my dad and nephew and told them we were going to lunch. We arrived when they opened and were seated and our drink orders were taken. I was leaning towards the Jack Daniel's Burger which comes with Jack Daniel's Sauce, Applewood-Smoked Bacon, and Provolone Cheese. When the server returned with our drinks I told him what I wanted and he informed us about the Monday specials and luckily for me the Jack Daniel's Burger was one of the specials. We all decide to order off the Monday Special Menu, I of course ordered the aforementioned burger with my nephew ordering the Tennessee BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich which consists Pork in Tennessee BBQ sauce, basted with Jack Daniel's sauce atop a toasted bun with pickles and Cajun-spiced fried onion strings. My father opted for the California Club which includes Mesquite-smoked turkey breast, applewood-smoked bacon, ham and Monterey Jack cheese on a toasted baguette with romaine lettuce, tomatoes, avocado and mayo. Our orders arrived and everything looked great, my burger was excellent and my father and nephew enjoyed their selections as well. When we finished our main courses my nephew and myself decided that we wanted dessert, I picked the Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie which consists of Chocolate ganache layered with peanut butter mousse in a peanut butter graham cracker crust. Topped with whipped cream and a peanut butter cup. My nephew chose the Tennessee Whiskey Cake which includes warm toffee cake topped with glazed pecans and vanilla ice cream. Served with butterscotch Jack Daniel's Whiskey sauce. We were both pleased with our dessert selections, I may have overdone it a little by including dessert but I enjoyed it all.

The incompetent waitress says she cant give me my drink because its expired, she then goes to ask her manger and he apparently said no. I had been to other restaurants, stores, clubs and have ordered drinks with the same ID with no problem, it wasn't till that day that someone brought it up and I found out it was expired. It didn't bother me that i could not have the drink it was her attitude.  3. We both ordered two $30.00 entrees and a Spinach dip for an appetizer which came 15 min late with crushed chips, she said ill bring you guys more chips they are being made. We waited like another 15 min and no chips. She then comes back with the chips and we say we want a new dip that one was cold by now she says ok.  4. Its now almost an hour since we arrived and no food or dip. A different girl then bring our entrees and walks away. We had no utensils, how did they expect us to eat a steak with out hands. I touch the steak and its COLD !!! so was the plate.  5. The original waitress comes back with our dip 15 min later after she took the first dip. Then she says: Oh utensils under her breath she takes off to go get them does not return for 5 min.  6. I was over pissed off by this point with this incompetent waitress, we asked for her manager explain the situation and say we will not pay for this cold food and that we will pay for our drinks.  7. The manager who is also i believe a bar tender helped us and apologized, he gave us 5 coupons and asked if we wanted boxes for the food, i said no but my bf insisted we take it.  8. We are waiting for the boxes then here comes the idiot waitress trying to take our plates and i hold the plate and say "" NO! we are taking this to go"" she rolls her eyes and smiles and says ok and  walks away.  9.  After this experience I would never go back to this restaurant am not surprised by all the negative reviews on here, am sure its the same stupid waitress. The only reason i would give this place a try again is because of the manger and how he handled the situation.  10.

They told us the wait would be 15 min. We waited for over an hour as they kept accepting party after party until my mother-in-law got snarky with one of the waitresses. They finally seated us, and we waited about 5 minutes to be greeted. Not too bad. Except that drinks took 20 min. o_0 My younger brother-in-law sent the tea back. Watered down. How disappointing a 13 year old knows bad service already. We sat patiently waiting with no silverware, wondering if it would ever arrive....  About 15 min after our drinks (1.5 hours already with only drinks), our waitress comes back and takes our order. I tell her specifically I am going to modify my nachos (vegan, no animal products), so I ask her if they had any type of beans. Refried or black to replace the chicken, cheese, and sour cream. I also ordered sweet potato fries. She assures me they have black beans. 20 minutes later  she returns and tells me they do not in fact have black beans. :( Ok, I tell her, just load me up with extra guacamole, pico de gallo and peppers. We are waiting nearly an hour and we ask about our food. She says they are plating it as we speak. So, we get our food and goddamnit! There is CHEESE all over my nachos! Ugh. I immediately get her attention and  politely send it back. So we've waited for over 2 hours to get seated and get dinner, and they've screwed up my order. They tried giving us another tables order 3 times.   -__- Food finally arrives and still no silverware? How is my family supposed to eat chowder, ribs and shrimp in pasta without forks?! We wait for our server again! We receive 3 sets of silverware as our waitress says she has to roll more. Wow, talk about lack of preparation. In the meantime, I am the only one with no food and I'm starving (waiting over 2 hours), I was embarrassed to have to ask everyone if I could eat their fries until my order came. It took 20-25 minutes for more tortilla chips to come out. No extra guac, pico de gallo, or peppers. I specifically said to give me extra since I axed the meat, cheese, and cream. I keep my cool and now everyone has finished their meals as I'm just receiving mine. But wait, where are my sweet potato fries? Another 10 nin go by and I flag down my waitress to ask about my fries...""OH! I'll put in your order right now!"" -___-   I'm quite flustered by now as now my family is waiting on me to leave as I  still wait on FRIES! Gawsh! [They also gave my gpa someone else's plate (a more $$ rib dinner), however we waited so long and he was starving (diabetic) and we did NOT want to wait another 30 min for them to fix the order. So he accepts it, and they offer no apology and still charge him! Geez!]  I get my fries in about 5 minutes after calling it to her attention. Why couldn't I have had those while I waited for my nachos?  My gma calls to attention they gave my gpa wrong plate, but since he's diabetic, he just ate it.  So it totality, we have a waitress that has horrible communication problems with the kitchen and wasn't adamant about my extra good stuff on my nachos, and forgot my fries, and was misinformed about my black beans No silverware to boot, or napkins, and super slow service, and wrong orders.

First, it's a cool atmosphere to watch local games since it'll fill with local people cheering for your team! Hooray! But this probably goes for every local bar/bar-themed restaurant in Los Angeles, so big whoop I guess. Second, the happy hour specials are pretty great. Cheap brews or margaritas plus half price apps. Having had a couple of the appetizers, they are not really worth full price so definitely do happy hour. Third, the service. This is probably the worst part. My most recent trip (since that is the only one I can really recall the service from) we had 2 different servers since we were in the restaurant for a long time because the game went into OT!

I am also in an occupation where you can feel really run down, really fast, so I appreciate that this guy was--at the very least--very good at pretending he was happy to be there. When he was leaving, I made sure to close my tab so I could leave him a nice tip. Which was good, because the girl who came after left something to be desired. She wasn't really unfriendly, but she was covering us for probably close to 2 hours and I saw her...maybe twice. I finally managed to snag her and get a drink, but it took forever to see her again so I could get the bill. She wasn't the worst waitress ever, but she could have done better. It was a good thing the Kings won so I didn't have to leave the restaurant feeling yucky because of this lady.

Also, our waiter was horrible! She needs more training! She was rude! Didn't ask how we where doing, if we needed anything else, and she had a little attitude. I think the final straw was when she drooped our food off and just walked away, after I said thank you.  Also ordered a new strawberry salad and there was waaaay too much dressing added to it.

My sister took her friends went in and waited to be seated despite many empty seats available. when they finally got seated they waited 20 minutes for just water. Another 20 minutes and they were asked to move because a big party was coming in. (my sister was in a party of 3 ) they were offered free appetizers that took another 20 minutes and still no drinks. However the party of 12+had all of their drinks and appetizers! Then they were asked to move again by a completely different waitress because theirs went to break! They got up and left. Customer service here is complete crap. When we called to complain the manager offered free $15 gift certificate after being told we will no longer come here and didnt really acknowledge the issue. It was simply ""ok I will give you a gift card"". Not once an ""Im sorry"". I wanted a refund for the giftcards I had purchased not new ones, due to the fact I wasn't, nor my family and friends, were ever going back there.

I order a lettuce wrapped stacked philly burger I get two patties slapped together a slide of Swiss tomato and two pickle slices on a little piece of lettuce.

In addition to his excellent service, he was hilarious!  He had us laughing all night. We left nearly a 30% tip and I would have left more if I had more cash on me! He definitely deserved it!   We decided to only come back on days he's working, lol.....only because i know we won't be disappointed.  If you get Travis as your waiter then you're in for a treat!

I only gave it 2 stars because of the superb waitress that waited on us, well.. not waitress but she said she was managment trainee. Very friendly and nice, so theres that.  The food however was so stale, I don't even know where to begin. The burger tasted like fish! The bread was stale and wet. It wasn't even warm. I felt like the bread was just hand picked from a bag and slapped it on the plate. The boneless chicken wings was gross too! The coating was so hard, It felt like I was bitting into a gobstopper. It was so funny because the guy that gave us our food mentioned how 'phenomenal' is when comparing it to the other chain restauraunts. EHHH! Wrong! It was the complete oposite,  the texture of the chicken had the same texture as tuna... like wtf. Breading was so hard I was literally afraid that I might break one of the brackets on my braces..

376,Sherry V.,"Palmdale, CA",0,11,,2.0,2014-12-30,"This is the third time I've visited this particular TGI Friday's in about 5 years.  I had been pleased with both food and service until this visit.  We arrived about 11:30, and the restaurant had perhaps 3-4 filled tables.  We promptly ordered drinks, found things to order on the menu and the service was fine.  I ordered one of the stacked burgers, mainly because it said PEPPERED BACON and I love that stuff.  Plus the cheeses and sauce (w/mushrooms) sounded great.  What I got was nothing like the lovely photo in the menu, and when I lifted up the bun, there was no sauce, no mushrooms, no crumbled bleu cheese.  Just thin melted cheese, a couple of pickle slices, lettuce and tomato and about 5 small broken up pieces of bacon - probably the same amount McDonalds puts on their bacon burger (the cheap one).  Plus, it did not appear to be peppered bacon.  So I asked the server why there was nothing on the burger - she said she told them to leave the onions out - I had told her if they were mixed in the sauce that would be fine.  I also asked if it was peppered bacon and why there wasn't much of it.  She took the burger away, and about 10 minutes later brought it out again, this time with some of the sauce it should have originally had, and the same measly amount of bacon.  This is not a cheap cheeseburger - plus I added sweet potato fries (which were pretty good) so my burger ended up being a $12 burger with about 25 cents worth of sauce and bacon.  As the place got busier, we saw less and less of the server, and I had to flag her down (over 45 min into our meal and she had not asked us if we needed refills) to get drinks.  It took another 15 min or so to get the drinks - she had forgotten until I waved at her and held up my empty cup.

Well we had asked to be seated at a booth since we had my friends 2 yr old son and won't stay still in a high chair. The young man response was they're people waiting for booth right now. He did not have no customer service what so ever. So he sat a man who was already sitting at a table at an empty booth. Well we asked another waitress who look clueless on what she was doing. We asked if we were able to sit at an empty booth which was still dirty cause people had just left. Her response was Im not sure. You will have to wait and your server will be the same let me ask for you. So she asked the same guy who sat us down. Although he didn't tell us personally but we over heard him tell the waitress that we couldn't sit there because people were waiting on this table. So they didn't tell us anything. The table was still empty we asked our waiter if we could sit at the booth which was still dirty by the way. He was kind enough to say sure he moved us over and cleaned the table. So we were happy about that. Everything was good till I asked our waiter for cups of water.

Review is strictly for the endless apps. Happy hour does seem like it has good deals, might be back to try it out.  Food: So that endless apps promotion, $12 for unlimited refills of apps from a menu of 9 apps. Not sharable with the entire table but I don't know if they police it. So my cousin and I ended up doing 3 rounds. We tried the buffalo boneless wings, bbq boneless wings, potato skins, pot stickers and bbq flatbread (ordered the buffalo wings twice). Honestly the only thing worth getting are the boneless wings, though didn't try the sriracha sauce, buffalo and bbq sauce were pretty good. The potato skins were weird, they looked crispy but not really and the cheese sauce was strange looking, not a fan of it. BBQ chicken flatbread wasn't great, it was a little bland even with the bbq sauce. The pot stickers were actually pretty good, the dipping sauce for them was good but wish the pot stickers were crispier. All in all I would only recommend the boneless wings. If we could re-do it we would probably do like 5 rounds of the boneless wings. 1 star for the boneless wings (wish it was traditional wings honestly). Service: Our server was Katherine and she was great. I honestly thought they would lag it with the refills for cost control reasons but she got our refill orders quick and it came out in a timely matter. Drinks refills were quick as well. Another star for the service. Location: In the huge Porter Ranch plaza. Located around the outside perimeter next to the In N Out.

133,Jillian R.,"Chatsworth, CA",42,145,67.0,3.0,2015-04-13,"Overall the bulk of my great experience at TGI Fridays on Sunday afternoon was the friends I was with. That was the only thing that was really great. Our server, Christian, did a good job. We were a large group so things always tend to happen when that is the case. I worked in the restaurant industry, I know how that goes. I don't know what happened before I got there, we weren't the first of our group to show up, but he gave us complimentary chips and salsa. He was pretty quick to come out and grab drink orders and they were quick to come to the table.  Then he came back for food order. I ordered a petite sirloin and salmon with spinach and broccoli as my sides...or so i thought. Only the petite sirloin came but the sides were correct. So, he offered to fix it, but I figured I would just stick with what came out. The food was alright, nothing to write home about.Something happened in the kitchen that led to a couple people at our tables orders not coming out when everyone else's food came out. So, they gave them appetizer cards which they traded in for desserts at the end of the meal. Everyone said their desserts were good (whiskey cakes, red velvet, and oreo ice cream sandwich thing).

I came on a SUNDAY during the NBA playoff games and happened to be wearing an old CHICAGO BULLS SHIRT and she even gave me some grief for that. She said I was a poser, when I told her I wasn't a Bulls fan; which I thought was pretty funny. Food there has lots of variety from Burgers, seafood, pasta, appetizers.

Wow, really?  Not even an offer to check with a manager?  We walked out of the restaurant.

201,Amber C.,"Burbank, CA",78,42,33.0,1.0,2016-06-06,"Let me preface this with saying that I don't often leave Yelp reviews, but unfortunately this warrants my least favorite kind.  I hadn't been to this TGI Fridays in about 7 years. My boyfriend's mom decided to treat us all to dinner so I was excited to get to go back. Last I remembered, the service was great and so was the food. We were seated almost immediately and drinks were ordered. So far, so good. I ordered a classic cheeseburger (medium well), my boyfriend decided to go for the build your own burger (provolone cheese, two patties (after asking the waitress if he could order a second one to which she said ""I'm not sure if you can do that, but if you can't I'll come back and let you know."" All she had to do was charge him the difference...), guacamole, crispy onions, jalapenos (for another additional charge), and his mom ordered the flat iron steak. We waited about...15 minutes for our food. At first glance everything looked okay. My boyfriend went to pick up his burger and noticed there was a tomato on it which he's horribly allergic to, it was missing the crispy onions AND the jalapenos. The sweet potato fries were soggy and inedible. The bottom bun was so drenched in liquid it immediately fell apart when he went to pick it up, not to mention it was ice cold. The lettuce on mine was brown and wilted. I just removed it and kept eating. My boyfriend, however, flagged the waitress down. She was young and obviously not experienced. He showed her what his burger looked like and was missing, and she just kind of stood there. She didn't offer to take it back, she instead had quite the comeback. ""Well, I wrote it down right. They must have messed it up in the kitchen."" ...Okay, see, this is where the server is supposed to offer to rectify the situation by taking the food back and getting it remade. She stood there for about 45 seconds and then said, ""Well, I guess I can take it back there and have them re do it. Do you want me to have them remake it for you?"" Uh, of course! He was visibly frustrated and I was quite angry with her response. About 10 minutes passed by and the second burger and new order of fries arrived. The burger was missing jalapenos. The fries were better. He didn't say anything to the waitress this time as he was pretty much over the experience we were having. He went to talk to the manager, Kyle.  Here's where I have something positive to say: Kyle comped a decent chunk of the bill which we very much appreciated. He was kind, apologetic and made sure we felt well taken care of after the bad night of sassy service and sub par food. I have nothing negative to say about him, in fact he's the only reason the experience wasn't all bad.  We paid the bill and headed home. About 45 minutes later my boyfriend and I were getting ready to leave the house to run errands when he turned to me and told me he was really nauseous. Huh. I was feeling really sick too. We asked his mom who said the same thing, she felt sick. We all ended up with food poisoning that's carried into the following morning as I write this review. We're all in agreement, we're never going back to this TGI Fridays.

I saw the ad for a full rack of ribs for $10 on the TGIF website and decided to try it out. I was really disappointed when I got them because they were the tiniest rack of ribs I've ever seen. The ribs on either end of the rack were so over cooked (or old) that the meat was literally crunchy. The quality was worse than the cheap pre-made ribs you'd find in the deli department of a grocery store. There was more bbq sauce on the bottom of the plate than on the ribs themselves. The baked potato only had butter, watery sour cream and literally three pieces of chives in it......THREE!  Check your silverware. I saw a picture on Yelp from a girl who'd found food stuck on her knife. Sure enough, when I inspected my steak knife I found a small, dried glob of food stuck to it.  Our server was polite, but didn't even refill our water once. To top it off, she never came back to give me my change after I'd paid. I had no choice but to take it from her tip (which she really didn't earn).  The only thing that was OK was the drink my GF ordered and the fries.

My sister had ordered a cheeseburger. The bun had mold on it. She had eaten half of it until she had realized that there was mold on the bread.  She flagged down the waiter and he took the food to the manager. The manager came up to us and had apologized and claimed that they have new hamburger buns coming in everyday. Obviously that is a lie since there was mold. The manager apologized and didn't charge my sister for the meal, but she was charged for her drink and me for my meal. The whole meal should have been comped in my opinion, but wasn't. The manager gave my sister a $10 off coupon for the same location which really didn't solve the issue.

At least they serve quality food and their employees pay attention to the customers! After experiencing the worst service ever from ""Sonni"" whom neglected to check on her tables and makes them sit around, I would never return for the lack of work ethic. I mean seriously to fail at being a half decent server takes some EXTRAORDINARY skill. The food is not up to par as well. A lot of people will order food based off the pictures they see in the menu, but at a (AIR QUOTE) legitimate (END AIR QUOTE) restaurant, you expect your food to look exactly like the picture. The only time you don't expect your food to look the picture is when you go to McDonald's drive thru. Whoever cooked my Cajun chicken & shrimp pasta definitely did not prep it like the picture looked and went way too heavy on the pepper. It felt like I was drinking straight out of the pepper shaker as each bite fell from my pharynx, scrapping through my esophagus, and finally plummeting to my stomach. After eating less than half the pasta, I couldn't take one more bite before I'd make myself sick. Yet, here I am composing this Yelp review with a still uneasy and upset stomach from last night's dinner brought to you by none other than TGI Friday's! Needless to say, the food is no good, the service is a disgrace, why don't they just close this place?!  P.S. My cousin had accompanied me and originally ordered the Chicken Caesar salad. For some unethical reason they mixed romaine lettuce with spinach and served her some other dressing besides Caesar dressing. To mess up a simple Caesar salad takes an unorthodox set of skills. She got chicken tenders after flagging down a hostess and explaining that she didn't care for the salad (because to reiterate Sonni will peer from behind the soda station's glass window to look at her tables but won't check on them, as she is too busy talking to her co-workers) and had attempted to try something else. When we got home, my cousin ended up being sicker than I and actually threw up whatever excuse of food these people dare serve to paying customers.

230,Amelia D.,"Chatsworth, CA",174,3,1.0,2.0,2017-02-19,"I frequent this location often, with no trouble. Today I came as a party of 6.  The restaurant was packed and we were seated in reasonable time. We were greeted by our waiter Chris but you could tell he was overwhelmed already just by taking our drink order. We finally placed our food orders after waiting a while for our drinks. I soon then realized my nephew did not receive a straw when he received his Dr Pepper. I flagged Chris down when I finally saw him and he didn't have any so he said he would grab one. As he was busy with other tables We asked another waitress, brunette with her hair tied up in a pony tail,  if she happened to have a straw. She didn't but she did managed to grab one right away for us. However what rubbed me the wrong way was she proceed to flip off our waiter when he said thank you to her. Our whole table saw her do this which was very unprofessional and made us feel uncomfortable. Anyways back to the food: Two people had calm chowder and both said the soup was underwhelming. It was under-seasoned and had too many onions. My nephew received his meal of sliders with the two soups And salad with we found odd.  My moms steak was cooked well and she enjoyed it. I myself ordered the unlimited apps deal and still had not received my blackened pot stickers while everyone else had their food. I canceled my food order as everyone was almost done. Chris admitted the kitchen was short staffed and you could definitely tell. I ended up ordering mozzarella cheese sticks because I was starving. They ended up being on the house which I appreciated. I also ended up getting my potstickers courtesy of the manger who never stopped by our table but was making an appearance at all the tables around us. However I guess this location did not know what blackened meant as I received burnt potstickers rather then seasoned potstickers. As they were on the house I did not say anything and again appreciate everything Chris was trying to do to salvage the situation. Overall today was not the best experience but Chris did do his best to make a bad situation better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-northridge?start=100,2.88,2.12,2.38,1.9600000000000002,2.424

I brought this to the attention of my server who claims they cooked the wings twice that it's impossible for it to be red even when we showed it to him. He later proceeded to have his manager come by and say the same exact thing. The manager also said how his prep cooks try to take shortcuts and eventually said he'd comp our bill $10. The appetizer cost $12. Also, when my cheeseburger got to my table 10mins later my burger was the same exact way. At this point I had enough. Paid my bill and left.

This is the first, and LAST, time I've been to this Friday's at the Porter Ranch location and I was SO disappointed. Our party of 3 got there around 8:10pm on Saturday night and still had to wait 20 min. for a table (wow, who knew a lot of people like Friday's?!). I haven't had Friday's in a long time (the last one I went to was the one in Woodland Hills over 8 years ago and it was way better than tonight's experience: good-sized portions, good service and decent prices (about $8-$12 for entrees)). Our server was nice but he seemed in a rush for some reason. He was prompt with our drinks (Red's Apple Ale (didn't bring a glass but it's ok, my hubby drank it straight from the bottle; tropical raspberry tea was way too syrupy-tasting and too sweet). Mid-way, he went on his break and another server came to help us (she was prompt with the water refills but after we got our entrees, she never checked back on us!)! We got our entrees in a timely manner, but when I asked for an extra plate (so I can share food with my daughter), she never came back to give me one, so I just ate off of my daughter's plate! Food is overpriced for the amount and quality you get. We started with mozzarella sticks. Six sticks the size of your pointer finger for $10!! Half of them were empty (cheese had oozed out of them) and we were left with only the ""shell"" breading. So sad. Hubby ordered sizzling chicken and shrimp ($18.50)- two thin, palm-sized chicken breasts grilled with 3-4 small shrimp on a hot plate with melted cheese and a small handful of bell peppers with a side of rice pilaf (probably a cup). The chicken was not dry but it was oily from the melted cheese in the hot plate. I was going to share the parmesan crusted chicken. Chicken was the size of a drink coaster and tougher than the leather on my shoes. It was a strange texture (like it was frozen, defrosted, then pan fried). The crust was not crunchy and was falling apart. The mac n cheese that came with it had not taste to it and the noodles were overcooked (not al dente). The tomato mozzarella salad was a handful of cut-in-half mini tomatoes and mozzarella balls tossed in a barely there oil vinaigrette. It was definitely not worth $14! The best part of the meal was the cold Red's Apple Ale from the bottle! We complained to our server about the food and he took off the mozzerella sticks and the parmesan chicken (which would've been comped anyways because we used a buy one, get one free entree with purchase of two drinks coupon but even with the coupon, the meal was not worth it!)!  This will be the last time I go to any Friday's.

Our waitress came, she was nice, nothing out of the ordinary, took our orders and came by with the appetizers and drinks  ordered. Now, I didn't try the appetizers because it was mostly meat and I'm a vegetarian but according to everyone else they were ""good,"" my drink and everyone elses seemed to pass as well. We waited talking and all and then our food arrives! I was greeted with a salad that honestly didn't have much of good presentation. I thought it would taste better but it was mediocre. In fact, the salad was quite dry and the dressing was too strong and thick, not a very good combination. I ordered a Cesar salad and for a Cesar salad, it was too acidic. The salad also had a grilled lemon...who grills lemons?? It honestly just looked like a dry lemon. However, everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals and had a good time. I noticed that the plates weren't so spotless but that's okay. At one point, I got up to go to the restroom and they weren't so great.

So it was a pretty nostalgic experience taking my own kids here last Friday. We had a great waiter named Wesley, who did everything he could to keep us happy customers. The problem was, we came for the endless appetizers, which took over 35 minutes to get to our table. What was really nice and sweet of Wesley, was that he sympathized with us and updated us each chance he got, he also made sure to get our next order right away, so we wouldn't have to wait another 30 or so minutes. He also kept the manager up to date with what was happening, to ensure it was truly an issue of a really busy night, and not because anyone was slacking off. We also appreciate the Manager coming to our table to apologize.  I've been a frustrated customer of other restaurants before. I understand not everyday is a good day. Things happen, and keeping things perfect is tough. What was really awesome about my experience at TGIFridays was that I was not ignored, it wasn't difficult for the manager nor the waiter to keep me posted. They were willing to nip the problem in the bud before sending a customer home. Majority of the restaurants I've had trouble with, will wait for an awful review, then ask me to come back so they can correct the issue. I never come back even if the next meal is guaranteed free because who knows what the hell goes on behind closed kitchen doors. Thank you for keeping it real TGI Fridays!

Mind you, the whole bar area has tvs. I called over the manager & I asked if it was possible if he can change the tv closest to us to the Laker game- without hesitation, he said, ""NO"" because the dodgers are more important than the Lakers. Excuse me? I didn't ask for your opinion on level of importance- I am asking you if you can change ONE tv to the Laker game. He continued going back on forth saying that TGI Friday's promotes dodgers and football- I asked, where does it say that? Is it on the website? Do you have it in writing? He stated, ""that's just what we promote"" in which I said, if there was a sign somewhere or at the door starting that only the dodger and raiders game will be showing, I would not have waited for a table, ordered food and or stayed in there. He continued going back and forth in front of other customers not taking into consideration that other people were also in Laker Gear wanting to watch the Laker game. It wasn't till I let him know that the person who was supposedly watching the dodger game wasn't even sitting at the bar area- that is when he said, well if they are not sitting here I can change it, because I don't care about them if they are not sitting in the bar area. Minutes later, the tv was finally changed after going back and forth with RAY. The two stars are for the waiter who did a well job making sure we didn't need anything. If you ever have a problem, think twice about approaching management on a Thursday night; Ray. He will make sure he argues back and forth before wanting to provide customer service and or before gathering his facts as to what the actual situation is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-northridge?start=40,2.76,2.52,2.356,,2.616

Also, thank you for taking the other people's order when in fact we were seated first and making us wait another 10 mins. Overall, their service sucks. This isn't the first time I've been to this place. I've just had enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-northridge?start=40,2.76,2.52,2.348,,2.616
35,Al P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,5,1.0,2.0,2017-10-21,"Not sure what happened to this place, but there are much better options than this one. We arrived around 3-4 PM in the afternoon thinking it wouldn't be busy so the service and food should be good... big disappointment. Started off with nachos for an appitiser. It was a fairly big portion with decent enough cheese, sour cream, & guacamole to satisfy, but the chips were a bit stale and the chicken was REALLY dry. For the mains, my gf ordered Cobb Salad. The portion was pretty big, but the lettuce was brown and disgusting. A double order of Blue Cheese dressing to cover it up, made eating it doable. I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and boy was I disappointed. The chicken was dry and flavorless. Looks like it was cooked by a cook that is still learning to cook or flunked culinary school. Service is slow. Took 10 mins to get a refill on drinks and that's if I was lucky enough to flag down our server. The best part of the place... the raspberry iced tea. I will never come to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-northridge,2.72,2.52,2.352,,2.6

On our most recent trip there we were served by a bartender named Page who was absolutely great. Not only did she keep our glasses full, but she knew about the game on also and had some great knowledge. We are now going to bring more friends in the future as long as we can get to sit in Page's section. She is a great credit to the restaurant and makes going to Fridays a great experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-northridge?start=20,2.96,2.57,2.384,,2.726
62,Thalia G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,1.0,2.0,2017-11-08,"Came here to celebrate a birthday. Our server was great my issue is with hosting. We waited for about 15 mins no big deal . The host called us that our table was ready and she walked us to our table . The table was dirty and so they asked us to go back and wait in the lobby. Also, the potato appetizer was over cooked and the bathrooms were not up to standards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-northridge?start=20,2.96,2.57,2.384,,2.726
37,Ken C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,2017-11-14,By far the worst experience I have ever had at a Fridays.  Crowded staff was unattentive and rude especially the manager Charles Bruce who spoke smugly and rude to us after we waited over 20mins for drinks and almost shouted at us and said if we didn't like it we can take it up with the regional manager Jason taminsky.  We will follow up with him because this place shouldn't be allowed to tarnish Fridays name.  We will know drive further to woodland hills or Simi to avoid Charles Bruce and this pitifully managed establishment.  On the other hand woodland hills is the best polite responsive hip and handles bigger crowds.  Do yourself the favor and drive to the next closest Fridays and save yourself the headache.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-northridge,2.8,2.53,2.38,,2.638

22,S W.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,15,60.0,2.0,2017-12-03,"This location is hit or miss.  When its really busy, its mostly miss.  On this particular visit, I give 1 extra star because the in house magician was the only redeeming value of the evening.  Thank you Bob.   After being seated we waited 10-15 minutes before our server showed.  The server apologized for a miscommunication and announced that she would be serving us.  She either looked tired or like she lost a bet that she had to serve us, I could not tell.   We ordered water for drinks only, and the server said she would bring our water and mumbled something about chips and salsa.  Minutes later we got waters and an order of chips and salsa we did NOT order.  We assumed it was an apology for the wait, but we didn't find out until after we got the bill that we were charged for it. During the meal, service was bad, it was a busy night,  and the server did not check up on us.  We had to go flag her down a couple of times to refill the water, and to swap out a side order. About the side order, someone needs to fix the lighting in the kitchen or something.  We ordered steamed broccoli as one of the sides.  The broccoli was BLACK AND BLUE!  No one looked before serving this? Yuck. Anyway, we didn't want anything else to go sideways so we quickly finished our meals and paid our bill including the chips and salsa we didn't order and left as soon as possible.   Lessons learned for the night: don't order the broccoli, order a rare if you want medium rare on a steak, and always question items you didn't order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-northridge,2.8,2.57,2.372,,2.662

The waiter we had was extremely rude and disrespectful!!! He hovered over us making sure we didn't share our food which is really wrong and wanted to charge us double for no reason because he thought we shared our endless apps yet we all ordered our own food. When we told the manager he stood there pretending to listen. All he could say is ""I'm sorry about that"" but was he really?? He didn't show any interest in his customers. We had to ask him to change the waiter for us because we didn't want that waiter serving us. Terrible management and terrible server last night. On the bright side the second waiter we had made up for the first terrible, disrespectful, and rude server and the careless manager. Needless to say, we will never be returning to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-northridge?start=20,2.8,2.53,2.368,,2.638

We got there around 8 and there was a 30 minute wait time. They sat us down in 20 minutes and we ordered drinks and food. Like always the food was ok but the drinks were not that special. The service is always ok at TGI Fridays. We always leave the place satisfied.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-northridge,2.92,2.56,2.372,,2.704

33,Sam G.,"Los Angeles, CA",349,31,8.0,1.0,2018-01-02,"HORRIBLE!!!!! BAD SERVERS and MANAGERS who maked EXCUSES for BAD SERVERS!!!! DONT WASTE your money!!! First off, our horrible experience started with a server named Justin who needs to be re-trained. We ordered ""the new loaded nachos"" to start. We got them and they were half the amount as the picture but didnt think much of it. When we got the bill it said ""grande nachos"" for $12.50. We had not ordered that, we ordered the loaded nachos which was adversted as about 8 or 8$. A manager comes over to talk to us. Mind you, the GM was there but the GM would not come talk to use. Instead the GM had one of the lower managers deal with us. That particular manager just kept saying oh we dont have loaded nacohs, the server prob thought you meant the grande. I said thats no excuse and we didnt expect to pay that much. Finally he goes to talk to the GM. Then he comes back and says ok ill take %50 off the nachos. Realy, thats all you are going to do? In addition, the server barely checked on us and provided poor customer service. I mentioned that to the so called manager and he just says "" im sorry, ill talk to him, your server is new."" Really, this manager is making excuses for poor service?  So what if the server is new, I still expect good service. In addition, although i didnt have a chance to mention it to the ""so called manager"", but my meal was luke warm at best as well. Not only the server was horrible, but the manager made excuses and really did minimal to compensate. Also, the GM NEVER came out to talk to us.  Buger King can even do better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-northridge,2.68,2.56,2.368,,2.608
20,Heather B.,"Porter Ranch, Porter Ranch, CA",0,1,,3.0,2018-01-12,"I want to first of all say that my 3 star rating is not indicative of the service. Our waitress was friendly, and even though she was obviously being overworked because she was in charge of several stations in the middle of a busy Thursday night, she did the best that she could. People like her should not be held accountable because of lapses in the management. It was crowded--which should not have been a surprise on a Thursday night. They should have had enough staff on hand. My main complaint was that the food took forever to arrive. Again, not the server's fault. It was probably not the fault of the cooks either. I am willing to bet that they are doing the best they could. Also, our drinks were kinda watered down. Not acceptable. Also, by the time our food arrived--we had just ordered basic burgers--was cold. I would give this place another chance, but I just hope that management gets their act together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-northridge,2.64,2.56,2.372,,2.592
