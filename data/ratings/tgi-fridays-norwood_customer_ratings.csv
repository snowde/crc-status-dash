7,James A.,"Norwood, MA",2,35,,2.0,2012-04-26,"Fridays chain is not the best. It is ALWAYS inconsistent! This location is probably one of the worst probably because it is so slow. I recently got the 3 course meal, and the dumplings for an appetizer were fair, but we're over cooked and dry. Some kind of chicken pasta for the entree. The chicken was burnt to a crisp, and dry and not much flavor in the overall dish. And finally the Oreo cookie ice cream cookie for dessert which was gross. The actual cookie had no flavor, and was probably one of the worst desserts I have ever had. If I were you I'd skip this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-norwood,,,,,
4,Natalie R.,"Hightstown, NJ",3,15,,2.0,2013-02-20,"Ordered 5 meals To Go today for my work office. They forgot the grilled chicken cobb salad (and when we did get it, they forgot the bacon and it was 99% lettuce). We also ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken w/ tortellinis. They gave us THREE. So i went back, told them and they only gave us THREE more. I did call the customer relations line and left a comment about this. They said they will tell the general manager but we are never going back. I also heard two ladies behind me at the bar talking about how they had just witnessed two other customers from the bar area leaving ""pissed off"". I'd stay away from this location at least if possible!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-norwood,,,,,

Cannot believe how down hill the quality has gone on the food here. So disappointed. G our waiter was the only good thing at this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-norwood,,,,,

0,Lewej W.,"Dallas, TX",401,30,4.0,3.0,2013-08-21,"Soooooooooooooooooooooooooo slow!!! Our waitress seemed like she was relatively new, but she was decent. She lolly-gagged a bit with checking on us when our food took forever and the restaurant was relatively slow. The food arrived after an eon but it was good. Everything was well-cooked and as we ordered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-norwood,,,,,
