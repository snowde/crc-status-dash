The place was packed and had a 20-30 minute wait. The Celtics vs Bulls game was on so we walked to the bar to see if there were any open seats. A server walked past us and said that there should be seats available in about 3 minutes. Sweet! I told the hostess at the door that we'll be staying at the bar. Our server was on point, super friendly and accommodating. Our drinks were never left empty and our food came out pretty fast. We ordered the Loaded Nachos, Flat Iron Steak and Yucatan Chicken salad all to share. Everything was good- typical Friday's flair. I must admit that the steak was perfected cooked to a bloody MR and the salad dressing was yummy. Skimped on the tomatoes, but that was about all I could find wrong!

My friend and I were quickly greeted when we walked in but it seemed like the hostess was confused at what she was supposed to be doing. We were led to an area where a few people were dining but most of the tables around them were all dirty. So we asked to be seated at the bar area. Once seated it took at least 15 minutes for a waiter to come by and ask us what we wanted to drink. In the meantime we saw what we think was the manager walking in and out of the back. It was obvious that there was a tremendous lack of supervision. Far too many staff personnel walking around or chatting and far too many dirty tables. My friend ask to speak to the manager and we waited another 10 to 15 minutes without ever seeing a manager and ended up just leaving and going to Chili's.

An usual substitution in Texas seemed to yield additional charges in a Oklahoma....hmm weird.   Food was served cold and we shouldn't have to ask that the food be microwaved.  Waitress was nice but she seemed Too much in a hurry to rush us out the door.   Overall it was the least impressed I have ever been sitting in a IHOP.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oklahoma-city?start=20,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18

28,Eddie H.,"Tulsa, OK",23,101,313.0,3.0,2015-06-01,A later afternoon stop for lunch found me at TGI Fridays.  I ordered loaded potato skins and the classic cheeseburger with fries. First the potato skins. A crispy salty exterior with a soft salted potato center. Topped with a pyro clastic cheddar cover studded with clumps of porcine remnants. The addition of the supplied sour cream cut the saltiness to a tolerable level and gave the appetizer a more appetizing texture. A fair but salty begging to a meal. Next the fries.  The standard small evenly cut strips of potato deep fried to a golden brown. Nothing remarkable but properly done. Next the burger. At first glance I was afraid the meat would be sub par.  The bun seemed to outsize the patty. The bun was soft and quite flavorful a small breasts pillow for a patty of meat that far exceeded my first impression. A slice of the knife revealed the tell tell color of beef properly grilled  to the softest pink of ground bovine perfection.  The patty featured the thinnest layer of crust of well seared burger. The cheesy cover was mild for a fromage boasting the name of sharp... A small disappointment on an otherwise proud burger offering. As national chains go not a shabby burger and worth the ordering.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oklahoma-city,,,,,

25,Real P.,"Choctaw, OK",91,4,,1.0,2017-07-28,"All and all TGIFridays has gone down hill, the memorial location blows. First I eat the endless apps and get sick before I even leave the restaurant. But then I also had my identity stolen and credit card fraud as well. I went home and found an additional 70 dollar charge and a charge on Amazon as well. Someone stole my identity. Management doesn't seem to care to fix this issue and as far as they're concerned my bank denied those transactions so the issue is solved??? No repercussions??? What a joke please don't eat here go somewhere else down the road I promise it will be worth it. Rather then eating here with horrible staff and management and food that makes you sick. Look up more reviews on Facebook this place sucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oklahoma-city,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

24,Damaris L.,"Central Oklahoma City, Oklahoma City, OK",0,1,,1.0,2017-11-14,I've worked in the restaurant business long enough to know what bad customer service is... Stood at the front waiting to be seated for about 15 or 20 minutes. Server walked in on her phone and looked us and processed to walk over and text at the bar. Server walked by and avoided eye contact. Hostess walked up to the host stand opened a drawer and left and also did not acknowledging us. Eventually decided to walk up to the bar and ask about seating only to be told it was open seating. Would have appreciated a sign telling us about open seating since usually it's not or someone acknowledging that we were just standing there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oklahoma-city,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
22,Jimmie B.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,22,9.0,2.0,2017-11-30,"Keith was our server and he did a great job. Other than that, the experience was less than stellar. A management type person was rude to two people who were filling out an application. He also sat next to a server at the bar and they discussed another employee using profanity during the conversation. There was an odor like a strong air freshener that interfered with the taste of the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oklahoma-city,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
