6,Jason G.,"Omaha, NE",83,357,111.0,4.0,2012-09-28,"ate lunch here today...Chris was the waiter and was a very friendly and quick waiter though he talked a bit too softly...ordered the 2 for $10 special, fried mozzarella and a pulled pork sandwich...with fried mozzarella it's hard to mess up, and luckily they didn't...it was hot and seasoned and tasty...the pulled pork sandwich was good but I've had better...and that's not a negative reflection on TGIF, just that when you've had the best, anything else doesn't really measure up...the bun was perfect and the meat was very tender and the seasoned fries were also good...all in all a very good deal and one I'm glad I took advantage of...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-omaha,,,,,
1,Royal B.,"Omaha, NE",425,261,17.0,3.0,2012-12-14,"Cleanliness 3 Service 3 Food 4 Likelihood 3 OVERALL (5 Best!) 3.3 I have been here many times.  We were greeted and seated as soon as we walked through the door.  Manager was in dining room, but was not making contact with guests.  ( I was told it was the GM, which means if he is not checking with guests, neither will his assistants.)   We ordered fried shrimp with our meal and they brought out scampi, even after having a conversation about it.  They made it right.  She was a newer server (her words) and was nice. The place needs a good dusting. Prices are too high for this level of food quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-omaha,,,,,
2,Jim W.,"Omaha, NE",22,17,,3.0,2013-02-27,"The reason we went to TGI Fridays this evening was due to a $10 off coupon on a purchase of $30 or more (with the normal certain exclusions of course).  I have not been here in a while, so thought it was worth a try. We arrived about 8:30 PM.  My first impression was NOT favorable.  We waited over 6 minutes before someone came to seat us.  I couple people dashed past prior, but didn't acknowledge us.  Quite franky, we almost left. We did get seated and had a very pleasant waitress.  All was well there.  There were three of us dining and we had a variety of food which provided a good cross section of their menu.  We started out with the Loaded Potatos Skins. Average at best.  Inconsistent fillings - and some were actually missing some of the ingredients.  They tasted ok, but they were certainly not what the picture looked like on the menu. One person had the Korean Steak Tacos.  He said they were very good. They did have some bite and the portion was great.   One person had the Cajun Shrimp and Chicken Pasta.  That too was good and the seasonings were fine.  Portion excellent I had the triple decker Reuben Sandwich.  This came with your choice of a few things and I chose the House Salad.  The Sandwich was great - a little light on the cheese for my tastes, but overall good. The salad on the other had was a bit of a disappointment.  To me when you say ""house salad"" it should be a normal portion.  The person who had the Cajun Shrimp ordered a house salad as a side order.  Well, the house salad that came with the sandwich was AT BEST half the size of the ""real"" one.  That I found disappointing. The one item I did have an issue with was the cocktail that I was served.  I ordered one of their ""Ultimate Long Island Tea"" drinks.  It had alcohol as promised, but the taste was lacking.  It was literally VERY flat, bland, or actually without much color.  The price was $7.89 for it, and to me NOT worth it.  Avoid at all costs. In summary, while the bar and the initial service lacked, the food was very good for the most past.  Will I go back?  Probably.  Will I be in any big hurry?  No.  I will wait for some coupon again..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-omaha,,,,,
3,Trekkie M.,"Omaha, NE",5,149,37.0,4.0,2013-05-02,Jack Daniels grill is the best thing since sliced bread.  Its sweet and goes perfect on the ribs they offer.  If you get a chance they also have a good french onion soup.  Its a little richer than Applebees but I like that about it.  It is clean with a good server staff.  Enjoy if your in the mood.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-omaha,,,,,
5,Kado N.,"Omaha, NE",1,7,,2.0,2013-05-08,Been to different friday's locations many times. This one didn't own up to my usual expectations of friday's. Crabby server and the food was kinda bland. Wont be going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-omaha,,,,,
4,Garrett D.,"Bellevue, NE",16,1,,1.0,2013-09-30,Terrible dining experience.   Left a little after an hour without getting our meal and speaking to a manager who never once apologized for the wait.  Will never go there again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-omaha,,,,,
8,Kellie H.,"Omaha, NE",21,3,,3.0,2013-09-30,Between 3 & 4 stars. I've gone here a couple of times with my guy for dinner. I usually get the Jack Daniels burger & he gets the Jack Daniels chicken. Both are absolutely AMAZING. Potato skins are always good as well. The only complaint I have about the restaurant is the seating. Many of the chairs are wobbly & last couple of times we went the table was incredibly sticky. The menus felt greasy & unclean as well. If it had been cleaner in the seating area I'd have no complaints whatsoever.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-omaha,,,,,
