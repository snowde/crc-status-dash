12,Terrence S.,"Davenport, IA",0,32,3.0,3.0,2014-04-13,The food was very good. I would give more stars but service is not very good at all. I got the half rack and all you can eat shrimp. Took forever to get my food even though place wasn't busy at all. They only give 5 or 6 shrimp at a time then take forever when you ask for more. My wife got the pick 5 app for her meal. All the apps were very good. Forgot my daughters  mashed potatoes. Asked for cocktail sauce for shrimp and he brought me salsa then mocked me when I said it was wrong. Hopefully we get a different server next time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-onalaska,,,,,
11,Cell L.,"La Crosse, WI",0,16,,2.0,2014-04-18,The inside of this place is filthy. My glass was so coated in dishwasher particles I could not stand to touch it. Service was very slow when there were only 5 or 6 tables with customers. Food and service were ok. Definitely way better places to go.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-onalaska,,,,,
8,Nick F.,"Milwaukee, WI",35,454,169.0,2.0,2014-10-01,"2 stars for a Reason. Place is kind of dirty, and Dark...though the dark theme is pretty typical for food places such as this.  They seemed WAY over staffed, or maybe it's just where i was seated i kept seeing workers just kind of standing around talking to each other. The booth we sat at both of the seats were ripped up which isn't nice to sit on.  Food was ok, Not at all worth the money. I ordered the Cajun Chicken and Shrimp pasta. It' wasn't bad....But TGI Friday's offers this in the frozen food section, and it's very close to the same taste, quality and amount as what you get when you're at the restaurant... which is a bummer as anyone can make it for $6 at home, or you pay $13 at the restaurant.  If you enjoy places like Applebee's or Chili's i'm sure you'll like this place, But i don't like either which is what this place reminds me of, Just an attempt to be a pricier chili's or applebee's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-onalaska,,,,,
9,Andy G.,"La Crosse, WI",16,7,,1.0,2016-02-06,I've never had a good experience here. I once received a plate of pasta that was frozen in the middle (microwaved? ) Another time i ordered a dish that was 2 chicken breasts and seasonal vegetables. It was one chicken breast cut in half horizontally and the broccoli was neon green. We joked that they use the same broccoli for every plate and just run it through the dishwasher.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-onalaska,,,,,
4,Carlos S.,"Brampton, Canada",21,248,216.0,2.0,2016-02-22,"I would agree with many of the reviews as this is a lower quality TGI Friday's location. It's darker than usual, doesn't look as clean as other locations and service is to be desired. Unfortunately, there are not many options in the area so this is why I ate here. The food was ok but the next time i'm in town I will try harder to look for a better spot and may need to drive further out. This is unfortunate since the one thing you should always count on from a chain is consistency which was certainly lacking here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-onalaska,,,,,
10,Robert J.,"La Crosse, WI",0,89,,2.0,2016-04-09,Both burgers arrived cold and the buns were dry and stale. French fries were also cold and flavorless. The waitresses was decent. Very disappointing,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-onalaska,,,,,
3,Kao V.,"Plover, WI",33,196,478.0,3.0,2016-04-26,"We, a group of 6 women, showed up at 10pm on a Saturday evening with the establishment being about half full. We were seated promptly and our waitress took our drink order right away. I had ordered a strawberry daiquiri for my sister in law's birthday but it never showed up through the night. I don't like to remind them when they took my order and had it written down. I know so because they would end up charging me later for it.  The food came out. Stand on the colder side. I was expecting the ribs to be warmer and the fries to be crispier but my expectations were off that night. I was impressed about their half priced apps and their menu is awesome with their half orders. This meant I can eat a good portioned meal for a reasonable price. Half of the attendees has never been to a Friday's so they were impressed with the quality of food and the flavor. The floors were clean and so were the restrooms. It was nice that they let us hang out half an hour past the closing time. That brought their 2-star establishment to a 3.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-onalaska,,,,,
7,Dale C.,"Appleton, WI",127,8,2.0,1.0,2016-07-16,"Came in with a group of 30. Called with a 4 hour notice, but it still took 2 hours to get the food. It was cold and burnt and definitely not up to standard. The server had to print out all of the tickets separately to be able to put them back onto the groupings we told her about before we even started ordering. I would not recommend this place. Poor service and food quality for TGI Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-onalaska,,,,,
6,Amanda C.,"Viroqua, WI",7,24,,2.0,2016-07-17,"Everything we come here they either mess up our orders, or overcharge on our ticket. Food is OK, but not worth the hassle and all the servers we have had interactions with act like they could care less. Not once have we been here that we didn't have to speak with a manager...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-onalaska,,,,,
5,Jeremy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,5.0,2017-07-06,"Torre! It was all about out waiter Torre. He was awesome. The entire staff was great! From the moment we arrived, until the moment we left, we felt welcomed and taken care of. The food was great too! We left our credit card at the restaurant and Torre took the time to chase us down across the street to deliver it back to us. Great waiter, awesome guy! Would definitely return if we were local. Thank you TGI Fridays! Thank you Torre!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-onalaska,,,,,
1,Tiffany V.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,6,1.0,2.0,2017-10-15,"We were visiting La Crosse/Onalaska, WI for an event so we stop by this TGI Fridays for dinner. The store looks clean but the food sucks. First start with our drinks, my girls' sprite taste nasty. It taste like sparkling water, over diluted sprite with lots of water. The my 'sexy on the beach' cocktail taste nothing like the drink, so watered down with one drop of alcohol, no flavor and taste nasty. Didn't want to compliant so much but we're gonna pay for it so we told our waitress of the situation and she was upbeat and quickly replace our drink but I am still not happy how my 'sex on the beach' taste. It taste like a fruit cocktail where the throw in what they can to make it taste a little sweeter like how our waitress had told us. Yuck! Then our waitress forgot our free chips n salsa for Friday members and she forgot my piece of lemon in my water. Two of our order was wrong. My daughter wants broccoli with her dish and they gave her free fries while she already gets mash potato. My broccolis taste nasty like they recycle the broccoli from other dishes. Why I said this? One piece of broccoli does not taste like the other piece, one taste soft and over cooked, while another taste nicely fresh steamed and still crisp and another taste and smells like day old and sour. I have been going to Friday in many different locations and had not experienced anything like this before. My grill Chicken was thin cut and dried, over cook, bland an no flavor beside the Jack Daniels sauce to flavor it up.  My husband's ribeye steak is a lump of thick piece of beef steak and looks nothing like a ribeye, and still runny with blood, when he ask for a medium rare. It looks nothing like a medium rare. When the waitresses brought out our foos, they dropped some food from our dishes on the floor in front of us. Overall, I am shocked, not happy but I still managed to tip the waitress at a decent amount. I will not go there again if I am in town the next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-onalaska,,,,,
2,Kristen K.,"Sparta, WI",13,3,,2.0,2017-12-30,"I don't even know where to start. Place is so dimly lit you can barely see, they weren't even busy for a Saturday night, but managed to take 30ish minutes for a simple order. Ribs, a buffalo chicken sandwich that was over cooked and forgot the buffalo sauce, and some kid's burger bites. Nothing that should take 30ish minutes to prepare when the place is hardly bumping. Took another 10 min for them to correct my order. No discount or anything on our bill. First and last time we come here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-onalaska,,,,,
0,Rachel T.,"Onalaska, WI",60,6,,5.0,2018-01-08,"I wrote this years ago, and we have been back many times, the poor tasting water problem seemed to get fixed several years ago and we always enjoy our visits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-onalaska,,,,,
