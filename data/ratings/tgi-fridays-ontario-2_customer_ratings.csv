0,Waynetta M.,"Fairfield, CA",82,66,59.0,3.0,2012-05-15,"The address is correct but the telephone # is wrong.  However, I had such a wonderful Mother's Day dinner at Friday's. Happy Hour all day wasn't too shabby either. The carnation was a perfect touch. We love Fridays!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-2,,,,,
3,Albert H.,"Scottsdale, AZ",117,1223,281.0,2.0,2012-11-27,"Servers were unfamiliar with the menu, and it was a very restricted/small menu compared to other locations.  Very slow service too.  Unfortunately it's one of a handful of options available in this airport, so I can see how they manage to stay in business anyway.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-2,,,,,
5,William G.,"Yorba Linda, CA",46,257,158.0,3.0,2013-02-20,This was an airport TGI Friday's. The waitress was amazing. She was so funny. Really made  waiting for our flight pass by.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-2,,,,,
14,Julie B.,"Rocklin, CA",0,34,,1.0,2013-05-20,"Bad representation for TGIF Fridays!  Wanted to have lunch while waiting for our flight but walked out after we opened up the sticky menus, couldn't get the 1 waitress on duties attention and saw how dirty the place - the other patrons said it was a long wait and not good.  Very sad considering there aren't many choices in that airport.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-2,,,,,
