6,Karla A.,"Upland, CA",7,44,24.0,3.0,2015-02-11,I had heard so many people talk about TGI Fridays that I finally gave it a try. I came here with my wife she got the Philly stacked burger and said it was good. I got the steak and lobster tail and it was not the best. The steak was flavorless and the lobster tail was dry.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-4,,,,,
3,Joe R.,"Corona, CA",1,42,4.0,1.0,2015-05-15,"Shocked with the food quality and service. Most of the staff seems to be there for the happy hour service. The restaurants side is bad. We got the sampler. Shrimp was hard, ribs were dry and if the others were chicken, it was sitting for a long time cause it was hard. Their burger meat has a dirty grill or griddle taste, the shrimp paste was tasteless & shrimp was fishy. Chicken tenders were nasty too. Tables were dirty and our server rarely checked on us, but was in the bar area a lot chatting with the bartender. I guess this place will end up a beer bar. NO THANKS ITS FRIDAYS.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-4,,,,,
4,Kim T.,"Ontario, CA",22,15,,1.0,2015-06-14,"This place sucks! I came here tonight for game 5 of the nba finals with my boyfriend because they were near by. No seats were available so we sat at the booth right in front of the entrance. We sat there because the TV was in our view. Not sure if that was considered bar area or dining but anyhow I guess ppl who sit in that row don't get attention from the waiters or waitresses. Anyways I ordered the trio sampler w/saracha wings. She ended up serving us an order of the wings alone, instead of the trio platter. I ordered blue cheese too, by the time she gave us the blue cheese we had one wing left. And I had to remind her to bring it out again. And by this time we just got our order of water here too. After we ate up the wings. All that time and no water till I had to remind the waitress. Next time I'll go Victoria gardens to watch the games.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-4,,,,,
5,Fernando A.,"Ontario, CA",20,4,2.0,2.0,2015-09-27,I've taken my wife to this restaurant multiple times and every time the service has just been horrible. It has ruined the franchise for us. We won't go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-4,,,,,
2,Michael L.,"Pomona, CA",7,2,,1.0,2016-03-05,40 min wait when their was a bunch of open tables ... I got unlimited  app. But it seemed I got each app. About 20 mins apart so it wasn't worth it ... worst serves ever ..will never go to this place again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-4,,,,,
0,Ann Z.,"Upland, CA",413,8,,5.0,2016-04-28,"After a long day of work and meeting's, I decided to come have dinner and drinks. I can honestly say Ryan & Chris at the bar do such an amazing job at what they do, being awesome bartenders. Everything I ordered was on time and served promptly. Trust me I rarely leave reviews but this gentleman need more love than all the negative reviews that are on here. You can never please everyone. So don't be rude and if you feel like you need a 10 star service , stay home and cook your own meal.. This Friday's is amazing...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-4,,,,,
