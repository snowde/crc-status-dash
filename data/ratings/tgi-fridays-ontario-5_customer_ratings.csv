5,Winter W.,"Ontario, OH",17,15,6.0,1.0,2016-04-07,"Went at 2:00 in the afternoon. They were totally dead. I ordered a cheeseburger with bacon added. Medium well, no pickle, no onion and a side of mayo.  Burger was cold, very pink(waitress even typed it in as NO pink... And I still got pink) it had pickles and onions on it, she didn't bring my mayo, and the fries were super cold too. There's no excuse for that when business is super slow. Waitress was ok, only stopped by to check once, never offered more to drink, even when my glass was empty. Glad I only got water. I stopped going to this restaurant in my town 20 years ago because of the bad/always cold food, and the bad service. Then they went out of business and was Johnny Biggs for a few years. Now Friday's is back. And the same as before. My suspicions confirmed; o will never go back again. You want a good, HOT burger, done the way you asked? Got to Applebee's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-5,,,,,
9,Brenda F.,"Ray, MI",10,14,3.0,1.0,2016-04-16,"I'm  surprised that I am the first to review this restaurant on Yelp.  Yelp! The restaurant was not half filled when we arrived.  The  host was not attentive, and barely lifted his head to speak to us. . Because we asked for a table rather than a booth (there are five of us!), they said it would be half an hour. We should have left then, but another table vacated just at that moment so we waited while the manager had someone clear it.  It took some time for the waitress to come to take our beverage order.  It took two trips for her to bring our drinks.  The food did not arrive for a long time, more than an hour after we arrived.  Slow  service,  cold food when it finally came.  The temperature of my grandson's French fries was barely above room temperature.  They credited my daughters meal, the sandwich and French fries were cold, and offered us a coupon for free appetizer on next visit, but I won't be going back. It was as as if the waitress took our order and went on break!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-5,,,,,
8,Steve J.,"Mansfield, OH",0,12,,1.0,2016-06-29,"Well so I just recently returned to Mansfield and thought I would check out an old favorite of mine. The service here sucks, I ordered the jack Daniels burger and the bacon was way over cooked. The fries were way over done. My friends chicken tenders were not  cooked all the way. The server never asked us for refills. We could hear loud conversation going on in the wait staff station. Loud laughing going on as well. Getting back to my burger it just sucked. It was horrible. Rude rude rude rude rude staff. Don't eat here. Its not what it used to be. Rude rude rude rude. So to fix the situation we were givin free voucher coupons  for free apps and our meal was paid for. We wont be coming back. When they have a problem they fix it with free app coupons wtf. However you need to train your staff better. The old fridays before they left town was so much better then this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-5,,,,,
4,Jason B.,"Bucyrus, OH",2,1,,1.0,2016-09-02,"For starters, the wait staff was horrendous. Almost as if they were being forced to work here for no pay cause their attitudes sucked. They were not friendly at all.  Our food was just OK, nothing spectacular. We did the all you can eat appetizers for $10. Well it took so long to get the second round that we was done eating our dinners. So it was $10 for mozzarella sticks.  We will definitely not be back. If I could give zero stars I would.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-5,,,,,
3,Kevin M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",36,111,73.0,3.0,2016-12-21,"Stopped in tonight, 21 Dec 16 with family wondering why all the one star reviews. We decided for three. Three stars only due the food and that the wait staff were trying their best!  Regretfully it seems that management did not have enough staff scheduled to wait and serve. Our waiter was the bartender. He hustled but trying to wait on all the tables around the bar area and make all the drinks for the restaurant was a lose - lose proposition. The only people to blame is management!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-5,,,,,
7,Leanna B.,"Wharton, OH",0,33,14.0,2.0,2017-02-19,"I hate to write a bad review about a restaurant. But this was just all around a below average experience. Not horrible but definitely below average. 1st we were made to wait 10-15 minutes for a table but there were clearly open tables. Since I don't know the circumstances, this was overlooked. Our server was not good. She wasn't horrible, just not friendly, not personable at all. Drinks took a very long time considering we were 5 steps from the bar & they weren't busy & they were just sodas. I ordered nachos. Server came back to tell me they were ""out of those"". Not sure now you run out of nachos? But ordered a burger. It was nothing special. No seasoning, I've had a better tasting burger at Wendy's. Asked for no tomato and there was tomato on it, thus permeating the bun with tomato-y wetness, which I hate. And the bun was ""toasted"" but not really. Not toasty, just looked that way. But only 1/2 way. Overall, not a good experience. I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-5,,,,,
6,Gypsy J.,"Canton, OH",0,14,,1.0,2017-03-01,Can there be negative stars?!?! This place is an absolute embarrassment to the Friday's franchise name!! The food is terrible and the service is worse!! The bartender Nicole actually told me she did not want to make my drink that was the Wednesday night special!! And she didn't make it!! No point in complaining to management they don't care. I just hope to save some people from going and having a miserable experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-5,,,,,
2,Laurie J.,"Mansfield, OH",0,17,,3.0,2017-09-30,Was surprised to see the poor reviews. We have been regulars at Fridays for about 6 months after joining their rewards program which is a great program!  Love their grilled salmon and sautéed spinach. My husband enjoys the burgers and ribs.  The variety of servers we have are always friendly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-5,,,,,
0,P H.,"Mount Gilead, OH",0,5,6.0,2.0,2017-10-15,"Stopped off after lunch rush today. Perfect timing. Server aka bartender,( there was no server for our section) was super nice, Clear though she had her hands full. Manager( no leader here) busy barking orders, and NOT pitching in at all to assist. Food?well? Chips n salsa. Salsa awesome, chips over baked, not burned but brown with that rancid taste. Chicken quesadilla, so greasy I couldn't finish. Taste was good though. Fries, ..bottom of the bin type, over salted and crunchy. Really disappointed with this visit. Didn't bother asking for a manager simply due to her attitude not supporting her team when they needed an extra hand. If she can't support her team she certainly would not support the opinion of a paying customer. It's unfortunate that I'm leaving this type of review",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-5,,,,,
1,Quila S.,"Mansfield, OH",0,4,,1.0,2018-01-06,I want to issue negative stars.  Line going in took the beeper thing.  Waited 30 minutes then watched 4 couples that came on after us get seated before us.  We ended up eating in the bar......NOT HAPPY,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-5,,,,,
