I was really looking forward to date night with my husband.  Started out good, waitress was doing great.  I ordered the Sirloin steak and asked for the JD sauce on it.  Had to pay an extra $0.59 for JD sauce on my steak.  When it arrived, I could barely shew through my steak.  It was so tough.   Husband hates sending food back but once he took a bite he knew there was no way I could eat it.  I told the waitress, who apologized, and asked if she can get me a beer while I wait for the replacement steak.  Thinking it was going to be on the house, I said yes.  Turned out she charged me for that too.  Well the beer didn't show up for almost 15 minutes and then it was finally followed by the replacement steak 2 minutes later (JD Sauce ont he side now, not grilled on it).  By then, I had finished my sides while waiting and then had to eat the steak by itself. I don't understand what took the second steak so long to come out or why a manager never approached us about the issue.  It was a Wednesday and not busy at all.  I have been here many times and this is the first time I have been this disappointed in this place.

257,Christal R.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,30,,1.0,2012-05-10,"Do not go there if you're in a large group of 25 people.  TGIF's was selected as a place to have a company lunch in the beginning of May 2012.  I had made reservations a week prior to my groups arrival. The person (manager?) didn't seem to be familiar with the reservation process. Nor did it seem like they really had one. I told the person my group and I would be arriving at noon for lunch. She said there shouldn't be a problem with seating although sounded unsure or skeptical.  Prior to arriving I called again to make sure that my reservation was confirmed and TGIF said ok.  When my group and I arrived, we had to stand and wait at the door for approximately 20 minutes as the employess shifted the tables around.  I even saw them ask a group of people to move because they needed that table.  You would think they would have thought this out in the beginning. But no such luck.  We were finally seated at 12:25 pm.  There was only one waitress to take the order from my group.  Again poor planning on TGIF's part.  The waitress did a great job though getting our orders down. But it nearly took 15 minutes just to get our drink order in, and another 5 minutes to receive our drinks.  After we recieved our drinks the waitress walked down the line to take everybody's order.  Food eventaully trickled out around 1:30 pm. The quality of the food was decent, but definitely not worth the 1-1/2 hour wait.    You would think that because of the large group and the profits they'd receive (along with the mandatory 18% gratuity for large groups) that their service would be much better. But it was extremely lackluster.  Never again will I ever go back to this place for a company lunch.  They're too inefficient and slow.  Go elsewhere to Bostons or Chinese food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario?start=220,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.116,2.96

207,Shannon S.,"Escondido, CA",503,605,187.0,4.0,2012-10-01,"For those of you following along my yelpy journey, you might remember that my beloved Mario G is a TGI Fridays fanatic. I've now been to TGI Fridays all over southern CA, Tijuana Mexico, and London, England. I'm a TGI Fridays aficionado of sorts. I'm not sure that's an accomplishment to brag about, but whatevs. Mario G and I had some business to attend to and we ended up spending a weekend in scenic Ontario, CA. We were staying at a hotel near the Ontario airport, and dining options were pretty limited. Wanting to appease my dining partner and his love of the place, we popped into TGIs and sat at the bar. It was pretty empty for a Saturday around 5pm, but they have a full bar, TVs, and snacks so we decided to stick around. The bartender got our drink order right away and made me a pretty tasty cocktail off of their menu. We ordered our entrees and an appetizer to share and a second round of drinks.  The bartender was happy go lucky, and talked a mean game. I noticed that the bar carried Jack Daniels single barrel and Makers Mark. I was surprised for the location (airport, Ontario, TGIs) that they carried Jack Daniels single barrel.  I noticed that they were pushing Makers based drinks on their menu, so them having makers wasn't a total shocker.  I decided to order one of my favorite cocktails.  A Makers Old Fashioned. The bartender stalled and made a witty remark while racking his brain on how to make an old fashioned. He confessed that he had never been asked to make one, but he would give it a shot. He looked up the drink on his handy dandy POS and he started muddling away. He read the instructions again, and shook his head. The instructions said, that he should muddle, and then throw out the cherry and orange. He said that although he had not made an old fashioned before, this just didn't make sense to him. I told him that he was correct and to leave the muddle in there. He took a taste test of the drink and gave it to me for the real test. He actually did really well! The drink was the topic of conversation across the now full bar and our heroic bartender took the time to explain to the customers what an old fashioned tasted like, and what Makers Mark tasted like. A customer sitting next to me at the bar decided to have one as well based on my thumbs up job for the one the bartender had made for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario?start=160,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.384,2.84

The server thought it was odd that I was ordering a burger protein style and commented no one had ever asked for that from him. Boyfriend had the same burger made as it should be and he said awesome and very filling. The happy hour menu extended throughout the entire restaurant which we thought was pretty cool.  Service was so-so. It took a really long time to get our drinks, and once we ordered appetizers the basket of fries didn't come out till the food did. Getting a glass of wine took awhile  as well.

This particular TGIFs is located in an unappealing location next to an office business park and the 10 freeway. The problem with the third time as I've stated before in my other reviews as with other restaurants WAS THE GROSS FOOD!.   I ordered jerk chicken. I know what jerk chicken is supposed to taste like and not because I'm black, it's because I've had this dish prepared right (The Cheesecake Factory does a fantastic job with this dish) TGIF just throws some kind of gross tasting jelly that supposed to be spiced like jerk chicken, and it totally ruins the dish. The chicken was tough, it wasn't seasoned or spiced. Throwing jerk chicken jelly on it was a sick insult. Whoever heard of such a thing?  It must be a TGIF invention, because I've never had this dish served in such a gross and insulting fashion as they did. With jerk chicken, the chicken pieces are supposed to be heavily spiced and seasoned with special seasoning, NOT A JELLY! You don't just throw some weird flavored jelly on it and call it jerk chicken. Sick.. What is wrong with these places that can't even prepare food properly?

Why? because the food won't be as enjoyable if the server and service is not up to par so yeah there's been times where I wasn't feeling the server and got someone else instead but this was at different restaurants. I can tell whether  the first few minutes whether I want you to stay as my waiter/waitress. All I ask is for a smile and if you have a nice personality then that's a plus, check up on us at at east twice, make sure the food is what we ordered and how we ordered, fresh, not dry, tasty and hot.

We then (after much debate) settled on a replacement order. I somewhat jokingly asked the waitress if she was going to give us a discount or desert, since we were not able to have the ribs. No more than 5 minutes later (after about 45 minutes of us trying to figure out what we want as a replacement)  magically the manager and waitress came with the meals we had originally requested and the manager gave us a fabricated story. We believe that the mysterious arrival of our correct meals was due to our request for compensation and if we had ordered a rib meal that was more expensive to begin with we never would have faced opposition in the first place. I have been bragging to my mother and grandfather about how good TGIF's ribs were and convinced them to try out the place. They were very dissatisfied and to top it off the bottom of my chair was broken. We do not feel the waitress was in any way at fault and feel this whole ordeal is due to poor management, whether because of a lack of ribs being ordered from your supplier or a lie to try avoi good on a promotion that TGIF is obviously running.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario?start=200,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.244,2.8

Came here on a Sunday night around 7:00. Ordered a draft beer, a well drink, French onion soup, pot stickers, 2 Cobb salads. Waiter was Sean.  First problem was no silverware, no waters. Ordered our drinks and he didn't remember I asked for lemon. Had to ask again.  The apps were fine but the waitress who brought them did not bring small plates or napkins or the silverware we never had. Sean was nowhere to be found. The girl took off.  Waited forever for the Cobb salads. Sean was gone for most of the time. In fact, he was gone most of our visit. He noticed at one point that we had been waiting for the Salads for a long time and said he'd go check on them.  When he brought the salads, they had no blue cheese crumbles.

You see I love the Jack Daniels Sauce, and I love that almost everything comes with it, lol.  Everything was delicious that day and made my mouth water. I ate everything and probably licked the plate a bit.  I was so full. To drink I had an ultimate margarita and it taste like heaven!! It was on point and strong just like I like it.

My friend has visited over 43 countries and when he came out of the restroom he sat with us and told me ""This place is in my top three"". I responded, ""Top three what?"" And he stated to me it was in the top three worst restrooms he'd ever seen in his life. I couldn't agree with him more. I had gone in there just before him and I was disgusted at the condition of the men's restroom. To make matters worse, I had asked for a makers Mark neat. That's how I drink my whiskey. The glass was delivered and just before I took a drink I noticed something floating in my drink. Yes, there were gnats in my drink. I returned the drink only to have the waitress explain to me that the top was left off in the bottle was filled with Gnats therefore she no longer had any makers Mark for me to drink. You would've thought they would've gone out of their way to compensate us for this but I'm not the type to ask so I left it alone.

Very small for the price. Wasn't great. Wasn't terrible. The pineapple wedge was VERY under ripe. Hubby had a mojito. He didn't even finish half. Said it was super sour. I've never seen him not finish his drink! Green bean fries were amazing as always. Hands down, best thing on the menu. The dipping sauce for them, just as amazing.  I got the fried chicken sandwich, with fries. It was pretty good. I had to add mayo. A little dry. Supposed to have a Tabasco mayo? Didn't seem to have it. But after adding mayo, delish! Hubby got the lobster and ribs. He got the lobster grilled. He loved the lobster. The ribs were amazing. Super tender, and lots of flavor. Baked potato was good as well.

Like I waited 45 min for salad and soup that wasn't even microwaved correctly. The hostesses are the WORST they like stand around on their phones don't do shit!!! I hate this place the one in Rancho is sooo much better. Do not go here unless you have 5 hours to waist for dinner!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario,2.4,2.06,2.436,,2.196
17,David S.,"Claremont, CA",15,43,,1.0,2017-11-12,"Neither my wife nor me were impressed with this place. I ordered fish and chips: the fries were tepid, at best. Some of the fish filets were tough near the edges.  My wife had a side salad with grilled chicken. Her salad was not thoroughly mixed and she had to send the chicken back as it was so tough, she could not put  a fork in it. I had an Arnold Palmer and there was more Arnold than Palmer. It has been at least 20 years since the last time we ate here...it will be at least another 20 years, if at all, before we eat there again! Thoroughly disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario,2.28,2.02,2.436,,2.124
4,Kaylee L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",9,49,16.0,3.0,2017-12-06,Server was great and our bruschetta pasta and Mac and cheese burger were awesome!! The potato skins... not so much. They looked pretty sad (note: the fiancé snagged a couple before I pulled my phone out for a photo). Why did we pay so much money for potato skins with minimal cheese and bacon? I only ate one and left the rest for him. Not very appetizing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario,2.36,2.03,2.44,,2.162
1,James B.,"Riverside, CA",14,9,5.0,1.0,2017-12-21,"We were very disappointed in this place last night . We had gone there for a long time and moved away and came back for s visit and the visit was a waste of time . The place wasn't busy at all and our waiter Thai had 3 tables and was not fast at all we waited a really long time for our meals . He was very slow and the place was very uninviting . Not to mention the food this time around . I ordered the chicken with shrimp and the broccoli . Broccoli was hard  as rock . Had asked fo mutter and got melted butter . The chicken said came with Marianara and there wasn't any at all . The clam chowder was old and rubbery on top . The Nachos what a waste of 12 dollars get a bigger portion with much more toppings for a quarter of the price at Denny's . Nachos here is chips with chicken bits and small amount of pico da gallo . We had waited for so long for check I had to take up to waiter and the RUDE girl standing at the counter in back by kitchen says to me ,"" what you want "" I handed the payment to our waiter and got dirty Looks from everyone back there . We also noticed a couple that walked in and waited 16 min to be sitted as well with 3 people having walked by and ignored them.  Very Dissappointed !!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario,2.24,2.03,2.432,,2.1140000000000003

7,Robert K.,"West Covina, CA",36,1,,1.0,2018-01-03,"If I could give less than one star, I would. So disappointed and dissatisfied with this Friday's. Half empty restaurant and waited 20 min to be sat, but that's just the beginning and was not even the problem. Server forgot our salads which arrived after the food. I ordered the special steak and lobster tail after a strong recommendation by the server. Two medium steaks and salmon took 45 minutes to cook. All came out beyond well done. Salmon driest fish we've ever seen and our steak looked like hockey pucks. The sides were wrong. Couldn't eat anything. We won't be going back to this location and most likely never any tgi Friday's anywhere. That's how horrible this experience was. Don't waste you time or money like we did. Sad that we won't be going back to one of our favorite places to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario,1.96,2.03,2.42,,2.0020000000000002
8,Jarred H.,"Buena Park, CA",0,5,,1.0,2018-01-03,2 and a half stars for a reason. The place is filthy including the back of the house which you can see directly from where you are sitting. Absolutely no Management presence at all. Took 10 min from the time of being sat to get greeted. Don't get me wrong server was nice and friendly. But the food took forever when it was relatively empty inside and even more was not appetizing at all. Should have checked Yelp before coming here. Only 1 star from me because Ive seen worse that really deserves a Zero.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario,1.96,2.03,2.408,,2.0020000000000002
11,Angela G.,"Riverside, CA",0,22,5.0,1.0,2018-01-11,"I called and ordered to go. But when I got there I decided to just eat it there. When I asked Shay to ask them if I could just have it for here, she said yes and then asked me to pay. I told her I wanted her to tell them I wanted it for here now so they don't make it to go. She goes to the back and brings out my to go order in the bag and tells me you can pay now and I'll put the food at a table. I didn't pay but I followed her to the table where she just set the bag on the table and walked away. Instead of taking it out of the bag or even getting me a server so I could have something to drink. Then she told me that they didn't have the tomato mozerella salad anymore (which is still online) so instead of calling me and telling me you guys didn't have it, you only made me one side and waited for me to come pick up my order?? What if I had to go and when I got here I didn't have time to order my 2nd side??? After I pulled my food out of the bag. She came back with my 2nd side I ordered and asked me to pay again!! I said I am eating now and I will pay when I am ready. Never did I have a server ask me for anything to drink. Nor did I have anyone check on me. Horrible. I understand I was the one that decided to stay but I still should of had a waiter wait on me. Horrible service SHAY!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario,1.96,2.03,2.392,,2.0020000000000002
