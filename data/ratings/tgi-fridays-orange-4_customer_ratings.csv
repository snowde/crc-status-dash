Went here with a couple friends last night.....went fairly late so didn't think it would be packed.....but man oh man.....we were up to our elbows in people.....the plus side was that we got seated in less than 5 minutes!!! Awesome right? They had this great deal where you choose two items.....one appetizer.....and an entree or a dessert.....really good choices....so ended up getting the green bean fries and the dragonfire chicken......I was tempted to nab the dessert but yeah we were all so stuffed by the end of the night! One thing I noticed that changed with Friday's, was the ambiance.....normally it's a bit darker and gritty but this location seems to have alleviated that....more lighting.....and the entrance got a whole makeover....kinda miss the old look....but hey, as long as the food is great right?

No big deal with that. Elena was AMAZING! Totally on top of everything going on. The only down fall was we got our food and had to stop someone for knives, forks and what nots. Much better then our last visit. Also, I miss all the stuff they used to have on the walls. They've sort of changed direction in decor. Not too shabby though.

I must admit, their lunch specials and happy hours are spectacular, but to pay full price during dinner is pretty outrageous. That is why I HIGHLY recommend the ""give me m ore stripes"" club. Easy to sign up and you always get coupons and free meals.  The food: I always go for the jack daniel's burger or flat iron steak. The burger i can never go wrong with, YUM. However, although I love the steak, their consistency of cooking it is not up to par. If I'm paying $20 for a small steak, that better be one hell of a juicy med rare steak!  The desserts: i love them all, strawberry shortcake you stole my heart. Service: It is truly a hit or miss. Some waiters/waitresses will be on their A game and some is just filled with laziness or lack of remembering. I love the ones that refill my water without me having to ask. One of my biggest peeves here would be the staff members standing around gossiping around the restaurant. Don't get me wrong, it is okay to chat here and there, but if you were having full on group convos with customers all around, that's unacceptable.

This place, hands down, serves awesome food at great prices. I mean, awesome food. If this chain were a professional wrestler, it would be heavyweight champion of the world.  Over the years I've come to expect not so much from places in this category of establishments. However, I must give it up to T.G.I. Friday's. This place is outstanding. I've been here three or four times in the past 8 months or so, and it's been excellent each time. Fast, professional, and courteous service. Bomb food. And great prices. I know I'm sounding like a paid endorser, but I'm not.  This place is seriously just that rad. I normally walk into places like this and expect to get ripped off. But no. It's just flat-out radness.

My group and I had just finished volunteering at a nearby childen's home. We were told our wait would be around 45minutes, so we decided to leave and go somewhere else. A host actually chased us down on our way out and told us he could seat us...They ended up shoving us in the corner by the bathrooms. We literally were staring into the bathrooms...and only ONE side of our table was lit. I was reading my menu in the DARK. You could tell they just threw this table together last minute. Our service was TERRIBLE. I wish I could remember our server's name. She was blonde and young. We asked her to bring us a sauce, and we had to remind her 3 times until we got it. She NEVER smiled and was obviously unhappy to serve us. Someone in my group told her that he had ordered something other than what he had received, she shot back at us with a bad attitude and said, "" Well, that's NOT what you said."" and stormed off. What the hell??  Are you kidding me? We weren't even upset at the misunderstanding until she responded like that. The food was mediocre as well. I was so upset that I wrote to corporate. I exchanged several emails with the management of this establishment, and after stating that I did not have interest in returning to this location, they offered to send me coupons to make it up to my party. I sent them my address, and GUESS WHAT? I NEVER GOT ANYTHING. Oh well. Bad food. Even worse service. Don't come here.

I feel bad because the servers at the bar are all very accommodating and friendly, but I came here to eat and the experience was terrible. I couldn't imagine a more tightfisted and cheap restaurant where they try to skimp on everything possible.  I ordered a California club because it sounded delicious and it had avocado (my favorite).  The sandwich was on crap white bread with packaged turkey meat.  To top it all off, there was literally one sliver of avocado squished into the bread.  Don't advertise avocado if that's all you're giving.  I commented on this to the bartender who helped out by going back and getting me half of an avocado to eat with my dish.  They forgot my side salad too.  It seemed like the servers at the bar had some issue with the chefs in the back because nothing seemed to correspond.

This whole time, i'm getting so hungry that at one point I considered eating my own feet..... Whilst waiting for the food, I noticed that everyone sat around us had their eyes glued to the tv's. It just so happened that we'd chosen to eat out on the night of a UFC fight.....which apparantly everyone in Orange had gone to TGI Friday's to watch.... So, the food comes and looks nice but ummmm, very minimal. I am not a big eater so there's ALWAYS food left on my plate but this time, I had finished and was looking under the table for scraps!! I mean come on, one small piece of chicken and three pieces of pasta pillows? Not cool!! The cleverly positioned sauce (spread all over the plate) didn't fool me into thinking there was more on the plate than there actually was, either! The ribs and steaks were apparantly good, but the tacos (which were not advertised as overly spicy) were in fact too spicy to eat and had to be shared among the more hardcore eaters at the table, resulting in one of us having nothing more than french fries and iced tea to consume. As if that's not bad enough, the whole place would erupt in screeches, shouts and profanity every 30 seconds because of the UFC thingy. I might have got a better deal by chewing on all the testosterone in the room.....it was ridiculous. None of us could hear ourselves talk and the staff just walked around like nothing was out of the ordinary. You may find this surprising, but some of us don't find the sight of two (almost) naked men rolling around on top of eachother, very interesting. Neither did I appreciate the people sat above me (we sat in the booth on the lower level so we had people directly at the side of us on the upper level) being able to look down and watch me eat, or inadvertently spit on my food each time they lunged forward at the tv's with animated punches, loud roars and bad language. Coupled with some of the women sat around pretending they knew what the fight was about and screaming whenever a punch was thrown, I was about ready to start throwing some punches myself!! The bill came to $90. I will NEVER go back there. Total waste of money, terrible atmosphere, sub-standard food.

And here's my favorite part: Rib-Eye (medium rare) + Half-Rack of Ribs, sides were baked potato and veggies. Yum! This made my night. At first I was hesitating on ordering their ribs because my last experience at another T.G.I. Friday wasn't so great. It was so dry and just wasn't good.

The orders from my friends were tomato basil soup, chicken noodle soup, shrimp margarita, long island ice tea, electric lemonade (adios), chicken fingers, a bruschetta, a steak, and a strawberry shortcake for dessert. As far as I could tell, the food was solid all the way around.  The dessert was extra delicious especially with the vanilla ice cream and the whipped cream. The service was satisfactory and friendly.  Overall, I can't say too much about it because it was A-Ok in my book.  I wasn't wow-ed by anything.  I'd only go there again if someone invited me to a party but its definitely not a daily restaurant type place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=340,2.6,2.57,2.57,2.1559999999999997,2.582

When he did came he told us about the happy hour specials by taking my menu out of my hand to show me what was available. Then took our drink order which was just water. We again waited about 5-6 mins for our waters. Then I asked him a question about redeeming my stripes (reward program). He was rude and said if I had a the coupon. Well once he gave me a half ass answer. He left again with out asking if we were ready to order. Which we were! Again we waited for him to return a 3 he took our order. Which my friend order a bowl of Broccoli Cheddar soup. When his soup came to the table it was not right. It was Clam Chowder. By this time went to the hostess and ask to speak to a manager. The hostess ask me to give her a moment. Which I did and waited for awhile. Then I told her that I was still waiting and I wait at my table for the manager. The manager (Ian) and told him my concern and that I was very unhappy. He apologize and that he will take care of it. We finally get out correct food. NOT once did our waiter come by an ask if the food was ok. He just kept walking by and just refilled our water cups. Then he finally came and ask if I wanted a box for my food, now hurrying us out.  Once I finished he took my plate asked about dessert and I told him I wanted the Oreo Madness, and then he walk away without asking if my friend wanted anything and for me to ask for my dessert to go. I told one of the other servers and he came back to the table and slam my dessert on to the table and said have a nice day.  I asked to speak to Ian again and waited for 10 mins before he came. And I told him what his waited did and he was lucky I did not take the dessert and slam it into his face. And while I was yelling at Ian in front of everyone and told him that his staff our all asses.

I had called earlier to ask about the times and was told last call would be at 1:30. So our outing was unexpectedly cut short an hour. We ordered nachos to end the night and oh did that save our night.  Downside: waiter basically stared us down and rushed us out the door & miscommunication of restaurant hours.

491,Melissa A.,"San Clemente, CA",1,15,,4.0,2013-03-09,"This review is based on their Happy Hour. As someone who savors a deal, TGI Friday's has an awesome happy hour that's worth checking out. With menu items starting at $1.50 for a cheeseburger slider or a plate of fries to $3.50 20 oz domestic beers and half off appetizers, it's easy to have a great meal for cheap here. While the food is great, this establishment is only getting 4 stars due to service. I've been here multiple times for happy hour and have the same setbacks each time. First off, this specific Fridays gets crowded during happy hour which is great for them, but depending on where you sit you can have ok to horrible service. Sitting at the bar is ideal for efficient service, but if you sit on the tables surrounding the bar, expect to wait at least a half an hour for someone to hand you a menu.  Today I went again with the boyfriend and we waited almost 20 minutes to be given a menu, followed by another 15 minutes for them to take our order, 20 minutes to be given the wrong food, and over an hour to be given the check after having to literally tap an Asian employee on the shoulder to get his attention. If you're coming for 3-7pm happy hour, plan on getting here at 3 pm and not leaving until after 5 due to service.  My only other bone to pick is they don't cut off patrons who have had too much to drink. I can't speak for all bartenders as I have never noticed other guests being rowdy, but tonight there was a group of three guys who left their seats and decided to stand right in front of our table (literally touching our table) and being loud, spilling their beer every now and then, and making sexist comments. They got to the point where one of them lost his balance and had to gain his composure by holding on to the back of my stool chair that I was sitting on. He apologized and it really didn't bother me, but what did, was that a bartender saw this, and still gave him at least one other round after that. There were a few female customers they were talking to that seemed bothered by them but the employees didn't do anything about it or cut them off. In the future, I can see as a customer how it's hard not getting the most out of the $3 beers and $5 long island iced teas, but as the company, learn to cut off guests when they're extremely intoxicated and bothering other patrons while not in their seats. The experience here should be positive for all guests, not just the drunk ones.  Overall, great location, easy and convenient parking, and an extensive and tasty menu. Be mindful of where you sit during happy hour, and allow yourself plenty of time to enjoy the cheap food & drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=460,2.52,2.6,2.6,2.256,2.568

I had good service from the harried bartender, who knew that everyone was trying to fill up prior to 7.  She never seemed more than patient, even with a patron who wanted a full description of many of the menu items.   I had a well tequila and flat-bread and a slider.  Slider was OK, nice and oniony.

203,Nemo R.,"Corona, CA",7,10,2.0,1.0,2013-04-10,"Went last night to hit up happy hour! Probably the worst service I have ever seen and the worst place to be on any night of the week. Lets talk about 1) Wait time 2) Service 3) Bathroom 4) Quality 1) We came in at 11, the lady came and took our drinks order at 11:10, drinks did not arrive until 11:30... THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS! It was not even that busy, which upset me the most. We then waited until 11:40 for her to come back to take our order. We ordered, and did not receive the food until 12:10. WHAT A JOKE... 2) Service was absolutely horrible. At 12:00 I wanted to order a drink so I went to go look for our waiter (Yes, I stood up and went to find her). She was chatting it up with a fellow person at the bar (I don't even think she was working there). I had to stand in front of her and the person for literally 2 minutes to get her attention, and it was just awkward...  By the way, the only thing I ordered was a basket of fries, there is no way that takes 30 minutes to make. Fries sit in a fryer for 3 minutes and its ready, why did it take 30 minutes to only bring out fries??? 3) Wow... If the FDA came here, this place would be shut down. I walked into the bathroom, the smell... AHHH!!!! The first thing you see is paper towels ALL over the floor, even where they don't belong (by the toilet). The trash was overfilled and paper towels were everywhere. I was surprised that TGIF has not even been shut down yet. 4) The quality was not as bad, but the fries looked/tasted like they had been sitting out of the fryer for like 20 minutes (which they probably had been because it only takes 3 minutes to take fries).  Overall, I really think the manager needs to revisit their staff and seriously take care of the store. There should be no excuse for what I saw and experienced.

We went on a Saturday night so there was quite a few people waiting before us but it only took about 10-15 minutes before they seated us.  We were seated and about 5 minutes later, our waitress ask us what we liked to drink and we both wanted water. My bf and I decided that we wanted the 2 for 20 deal and order dessert after: For our app: we got the mozzarella stick: it was good but the best was the marinara sauce ( I REALLY like the sauce for some reason) maybe because I was just really hungry! hahaha! BUT we had to wait about 30 minutes for our app.. it took a really long time for some reason and when we were done with app it took about another 20 minutes for our entree. We waited really long for our food! :( But this is what we order:  For my entree I got the parmesan crusted chicken (which was an extra 3 bucks) and for my sides I had tortelline with a spinach cream sauce  and a tomato and mozzarella salad. I decided chicken because  I didn't want steak or pasta and I must say it is my favorite dish from T.G.I so far. The chicken was really moist and the sides goes well with the chicken. The spinach cream sauce was very tasty as well it fits perfectly with the chicken. Highly recommend! My bf got the Jack Daniel Chicken with fried shrimps with loaded mash potatoes and cole slaw ( which was an extra 5 bucks). It wasn't worth the money. The sauce was good but the Chicken was plain and flavorless. My bf was eating off of my food rather then his! He hated the cole slaw because it wasn't to his liking. It was honestly personal taste he liked shredded cole slaw (like KFC).  Finally for dessert: we ordered the Whiskey cake (or something along that line) It was really good. It finished my night! I would recommend sharing this dessert because it is really sweet but it's one of those dessert where you would want to come back for more! I believe it is a toffee cake with topped pecans and vanilla ice cream on the side! The sauce was my favorite: there is this white sauce ( I don't know what it is) but it's my favorite! I took a little of the cake, sauces, and ice cream and it was the perfect bite! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!   But service was a bit slow, our waitress came about twice to check up on us but when we were about to leave and asked for a box and bill she came back with the bill but forgot about the box.

We arrived approximately about 7 pm or so originally with a party of 9 to celebrate our nephews graduation. We were originally told that it would be a 45 min wait. During our wait some other friends from the same graduation arrived so we decided to all to sit together. So our wait extended from 45 minutes about an hour or so which was fine by us because we knew or party went from 9 to 18. About 8:45 a table becomes available  but it's located on the opposite side of the restaurant far away from where our graduating children were seated and the whole purpose of going to dinner was to celebrate together. Both my wide and sister-in-law asked to speak to a manager and they told her the waitress that sat our party said she would accommodate us on the same side as our children and instead of being considerate and providing excellent customer service she said we follow a rotating schedule and that's why you are being seated on this side of the restaurant. My wife and sister-in-law apologized for any confusion asked to if we can then be seated outside and Jessica (Manager on Duty ignored our apology and with an attitude said ""Yeah, I guess I can sit you outside"" as she rolled her eyes). Jessica - Manager displayed very poor customer service, poor communication and showed our entire party non-management like attitude and leadership skills to other staff and guest. The only honest to good thing that night was our waitress ""Erika"" who displayed way better customer service then the manager on duty. Things only got worse when we asked Erika to bring us our separate checks as we originally requested. Next thing you know; Jessica called Mall Security because we were supposedly loud and disruptive. This made some of us upset as Jessica was talking to Mall Security pointing her finger at our party. Some of our party went to try and communicate and defuse the situation (which you think would be coming from management). Next thing you know the police showed up which was totally unnecessary. Our entire party felt disrespected as TGIF customers.

As the waitress was clearing the appetizer dishes she spilled marinara sauce all over the floor and all over 4 of us. She brought extra napkins and club soda which helped get the sauce out of our clothes. Hopefully it won't stain my new jeans that I was wearing.  My hubby and friend ordered the flight of beers. As my hubby was finishing his beer we noticed that his glass was cracked from top to bottom. The waitress was horrified and offered him a free dessert.

This review is based on their happy hour which is from 3-7 and then 10-close, kudos on the extended hours!  What I had: Ultimate Blue Raspberry Margarita - I got it blended, it wasn't too strong so the flavor was pretty on point. Can't say it got me anywhere close to a buzz not even after the beer I followed it up with. Potato Skins - these kind of tasted like they were frozen and just popped in the microwave. Boneless Buffalo Wings - not the best I have ever had, but not the worst. I will note that I did get one wing which had a lot of fat, completely ruined it. Sesame Jack Chicken Strips - I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor of these. I'm not much of a barbeque or teriyaki fan, but their sauce made the chicken strips worth while! Pot Stickers - decent little dumplings. My first time trying pot stickers so I really have no other experiences to compare them to. Wouldn't say they are my favorite, but they weren't half bad. I enjoyed the sauce they are served with. The food is extremely average at best and nothing more, but the prices are great!

250,Shanda H.,"Orange County, CA",305,90,236.0,2.0,2013-08-11,"i got the potato skins. They were the worst I've ever had! They look like the cheese had already been pre-melted and then melted over again and the potato part was too thick and not crispy.  I have bought the TGI Friday's frozen ones in the grocery store  and never bought again because they SUCKED.  These taste just like those! I also ordered some White Russians mixed with coke and they were iced down and weaker than I've had elsewhere. So, with the crappy potato skins & weak drinks, now lets throw in maybe the worst waitress I've ever encountered: Natasha (short curly light brown hair with glasses) If she sees this review, maybe she will wonder why the tip was less than even doubling the tax.  Well, Natasha, here are the multiple reasons why that happened: 1) very limited to non-existent eye contact 2) when we ordered the drinks, we also asked for water, but she never bothered to bring any water. We had to ask for it again 3) when the potato skins arrived, there were no eating utensils, so I asked her for those and she just grabbed them off another table.  She didn't even realize until I asked that there were no utensils 4) after she walked away, I then realized I didn't have a plate, so had to put the thing on a napkin on top of the table and try to use it as a make shift plate, as the grease soaked through, making it start to tear so the thing started touching the table underneath.  When she eventually returned to help fellow patrons seated next to us, I then asked for plates and she brought some and some napkins as well! yeah, so the only napkin we had while waiting for her to return, was the one that I was currently using as a plate that was previously wrapped around the utensils she'd grabbed off of another table. 5) When she brought the bill, she could clearly see there were 6 potato skins remaining and she just walked away after leaving the bill, without even asking us if we needed a to-go box!  So, of course, wait even longer then, to wait till she comes back, to ask for a to-go box. It seemed blatantly obvious that she must not have any experience as a waitress, so I realized that maybe if I needed a job in the future, should the current one not work out, I could always apply at TGI Fridays, since apparently, they don't require any previous experience in that profession - or if they do - maybe they just don't check the applicant's references??

Reading these reviews, I've noticed that a lot of them like to go out of their way to give the names and physical descriptions of the employees serving them, after a negative experience.  While there is clearly nothing wrong with offering constructive criticism, I find it reprehensible to try to humiliate someone on this site just because they may have had a bad day on the job, or perhaps have not yet mastered it.  There is simply no need for it.  Criticism can be given without resorting to dragging someone's name through the mud.  It's low-class, and reeks of self-importance on the part of the reviewer.

Quality of the food is very important and I was definitely disappointed. I ordered the fish and chip and they were nearly burnt. I asked our server if he thought it was burnt and his response was that he didn't know, so I had the food sent back. While waiting for my food to come and staring at my family eating, I munched on my sons french fries from his chicken tenders. A lady in a green shirt (maybe the manager) came up gave me the refired item, but didn't apologize for the iconvenience. All she said was fish and chips fries well done. I compared my sons fries to mine and saw a big difference in freshness. His fries look as limp and soggy as if it were sitting out too long. So I asked the server again, what is the difference between these 2 fries. He had the same reply stating that he doesn't know. It is obvious that the fries we got were not fries and I wanted my son to have fresh fries, so I gave him mine and waited for new ones. I hate to complain, but an apology would have been nice. Not even our server aplogized. Customer service 0 points. My family enjoyed their meal though, so 2 stars it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=440,2.56,2.54,2.54,2.248,2.548

We were really hungry at this point so we went ahead and ordered. appetizers pretzels were really salty and our food took way too long to get there. Our drinks didnt get refilled unless we ask for. Personally my food was horrible I order a hamburger and it looked like it was just thrown together the patty was broken into pieces  before I even started eating and had no taste, the French fries were really bad taste it old and salty we didn't get napkins we have to ask for them and the service it was just horrible I don't think I'm ever going to go there again...

552,Alex L.,"Anaheim, CA",260,300,156.0,2.0,2014-02-15,"Pluses: This is a TGI Fridays. If you're familiar with their food and drinks, that's a plus in and of itself. If you're going to be liquoring it up, get something with the words ""Ultimate"" on it. The size is supposed to get you tipsy, and they normally don't skimp on the alcohol. I used to get the Ultimate Mudslide, but alas, they don't serve it anymore. You can never go wrong with the burgers. Just make sure you make a fuss that they're cooked the way you like them. The Jack Daniels menu is always decent. Minuses: ---sigh Where do I begin? Instead of going into a treatise about the slow decline of the Great American Restaurant chains, allow me to present my pieces of evidence to illustrate the decline: * the slow service, it was hard to find for us to find people even though it was 1PM and there wasn't a lunch crowd on a Monday. * the lackluster food. The thing that me and Maureen C. actually liked was the appetizer, in this case, the flatbread. Everything else was forgettable. Verdict: Go into the Block or whatever they call this place now, and eat in there. You will save money, and you will be more satisfied. If you're willing to take a gamble and be disappointed, this is the place for you. We took that gamble, and lost. We're just glad that the food wasn't bad.

292,Steve R.,"Temecula, CA",0,9,,1.0,2014-02-15,"My wife and I arived at 5:00 pm, on a Saturday. Experience was Very disappointing, especially after I looked across the street and saw a BJ's right there close by. Should have driven around and made a better choice. Here's the scoop: Hostess nowhere to be seen when we entered. At first it didn't seem they even HAD a hostess station. Lots of people sitting (15-20) in the waiting area. I look around to see 3/4 of the tables are empty. After a couple of minutes waiting, hostess arrives and I assume that we would be seated. WRONG! She asked for our name and wrote it down, said it'll be five or ten minutes. ???? She disappears. I looked around, counted 25 tables open (that I could see) and 7 tables with people seated. WTF? Everyone else in the waiting area were seemingly just as perturbed over the same thing.     We ordered potato skins appetizer, came out cold, bland, and tasted like it was frozen and microwaved for serving. My wife ordered a steak medium rare, it came barely medium and was cold. I ordered buffalo chicken sandwich, but hold the buffalo, make it dry with ranch on the side. In this case, size matters because it was appox 2"" X 5"" in size, total. The chicken breast was pounded thin, appox 1/4""-3/8"" thick, 3/8-1/2"" thick if you include the breading. Even as small as the sandwich was, the chicken didn't cover the bread. Tiny. If you ever looked at a Burger King original chicken sandwich   patty, this is about 1/2-2/3 that size, and not as thick in most places. The bread was ciabatta, and hard as a rock. Really. I could bang it on the table and you could hear it across the restaurant. Fries were cold and soggy. Order took 45 minutes to get to the table in a nearly empty restaraunt.   Everything served here either comes out of a box frozen, or held forever under a heat lamp that's pointed in the wrong direction. It's fast food quality, barely. Cheap mall food is way better. And better for the money. My wife had a 10 oz steak and baked potato, a cup of soup, I had the tiny, rock hard, dry chicken sandwich, two sodas and the potato skin appetizer and that came to almost $50.00!    Save youself the horrific dining experience and just go to BJ's or Dave and Busters, or ANYWHERE ELSE but here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=420,2.52,2.48,2.48,2.212,2.496

To celebrate birthdays, girls night out or just simply for dinner. the times ive been here with friends have been good, except for the last time i came which was on a friday nite with two friends. we got there and the wait wasnt so bad, it was early too around 730 pm so that might be the reason why the wait wasnt so long. wait time on a friday night after 8ish is sometimes up to an hour. we got called and got seated on a table but we asked if we could be seated in a booth, which was no problem. yay for booths! haha our server came in and asked for our drink order, we already knew what we wanted so the three of us order the drinks that come in mason jars. we were so excited to get our drinks! but were soo dissapointed when he brought us the drinks! one of our friend did get her drink in a mason jar but me and my other friend got our drink in a regular tall glass... i asked the waiter about the jar and he said the drink we order didnt come in a mason jar and in hes words he told our other friend that got her drink in a mason jar ""you got lucky"". he left and for a moment i accepted what he told us. but then i was like no, our drink is under the mason jar drink menu and no where does it say the drink we order come in a regular tall glass. so when he came back i told him i wanted my mason jar because it does not say my drink comes in regular glass he then admits to messing up our order and tells us he'll bring our jars after we are done and i say no, i want my jar now. he goes back and brings the jars, empty. he then says it will cost more to order the same drink. at this point idgaf i just wanted my mason jar. but my other friend gets offended by what he says and asks for a manager. long story short, and after my friend telling him what happened he tells us he will cover our appetizers and drinks the manager takes our drinks with mason jars and fills them with our drink and brings them back and apologizes and also assigns a new waitress. after that everything went good! we all order the canjun chicken and shrimp (pasta with a sauce that taste kinda like alfredo sauce, shrimp and chicken) recommended by the waitress. it was really good. our drink was in a mason jar which you can take home, we got the june bug, it wasnt strong, but i did enjoy the taste, fruity taste. make sure they give you the drink in a mason jar!!!! as for appetizers i order the spinach and artichoke dip with chips, my all time favorite appetizer, my other two friends order boneless chicken wings and potato wedges. i was so upset they dont longer serve the tgif appetizer plater which came with chicken wings, mozzarella sticks and,  potato wedges. i was going to order dessert but i got full with my drink, appetizer, and dinner plate. but ive been craving the red velvet cake!! my favorite dessert from tgi fridays. sign up in there website and receive a free appetizer or dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=360,2.52,2.47,2.47,2.512,2.49

It was the first night coming back from D.C after being gone for the week and I was craving for their firecracker chicken plate and of course some margaritas so the ""hubby"" suggested going to the TGIF location at ""The Block"" so we can catch a movie after. BAD IDEA!  We sat ourselves at the bar area right in front of the bartender who seemed like he wanted to go home. Took over 15 mins to acknowledge our presences there and finally ask -""What can I get you?"" Since he took so loong to ask us, we ordered everything all at once, drinks and food. Come to our surprise, he only wrote down our drinks...my ultimate margarita was filled with all ice and very little liquor and cocktail mix..and the hubby had a Shock-Top. The margarita was gross..tasted like a rotten strawberry infused sink water. Had my Fiance tasted it and he agreed,  told the bartender we wanted to change my drink and he straight out snatched the glass off of my Hubby's hands and poured it down the sink then walked off without asking what we wanted to change our drinks to. Comes back with the same margarita only tasted more watered down! So I told my Fiance, forget it, I'll just stick with it. When it came to asking for our food and why it took so long, he acted like we only ordered drinks, no food was taken down....-_- HELLOOOO WEREN'T YOU LISTENING TO US??? WEREN'T YOU THE ONE WHO TOOK THE MENU BACK AFTER HEARING OUR ORDER?...We paid the pity $8 on our drink tab and left, no tip, which is very rare for us.

28,Julie H.,"Orange County, CA",880,426,2093.0,4.0,2014-10-03,"One thing I've come to appreciate about Friday's is their tenacity to continually improving the quality of the customer experience at their restaurants. I mean this generally rather than on a face to face basis. It had been at least 6 months since my last visit to Friday's and I decided to show up for a late dinner last night. I was greeted by two friendly hostesses who sat us within 10 minutes as they had initially indicated. The hostess explained the new menu and ordering via ipad (or some other tablet-looking device they had) option that they now have and informed us that we could order drinks, food and pay our bill on it. I was a bit worried that this meant that we wouldn't be seeing much of our waitress but she actually showed up 5 minutes later and was very friendly and provided excellent service. Their menu is a bit of a maze but the descriptions are great as are the pictures. They have a lot more side options than they did before. They have mozzarella and tomato salad, sweet potato fries and baked potatoes to name a few. Here's what we ordered: Shrimp cocktail appetizer: The sauce is decent, the shrimp are small.  Grilled Norwegian salmon with Langostino lobster: Comes with about 6 oz of salmon and is topped with a creamy mushroom sauce and small chunks of lobster. I had the baked potato and the tomato mozzarella for my two sides. The creamy sauce was definitely the best part of the dish. It enhanced the fishy taste of the salmon and lobster without making it taste too salty. The baked potato was good but a bit dry and the salad was tasty but not what I'm used to expecting with a caprese salad. It had bits of onion which took away from the usual pungent balsamic taste.  Philly stacked burger: My friend ordered this burger and said it was tasty enough but just not very big.   Oreo madness: Shareable dessert that doesn't make you feel too guilty calorie-wise. It has soft oreo crumb layers with cookies n cream ice cream sandwiched between them. Comes with a chocolate drizzle and whipped cream. Delicious!  If I had to offer any criticism, it would be for the portion sizes. You're paying enough money here to get a good amount of food and best way I could describe the portion sizes would be ""health conscious"". These portions are perfect for when you're watching your weight but I think we all look to splurge a little when going out to a restaurant like Friday's.  Nevertheless, our server refilled our drinks often, she immediately noticed when we ordered food on the ipad and brought it out for us and we got to catch up on sports news that was playing on their many tvs. All in all a great experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=200,2.6,2.55,2.576,2.7039999999999997,2.5700000000000003

First off, this location for some reason gets really busy. It doesn't matter the day of the week. Especially at night, be ready to hurry up and wait for a table, even for small parties. The waiting area isn't very big either (as it seems with most TGIs), so if it's especially busy, be ready to wait outside. Speaking of waiting, be prepared to wait for your food after ordering. It could be because of the high levels of business, but on average, I've had to wait about 15-20 minutes for food to hit the table (for a party of 2). The service here is average. I've had both great experiences and really poor ones, so it all sort of balances itself in the end. Food quality itself, again, sort of fares on the average side of things.

I ordered a Rib eye steak and lobster dinner with parmesean potatoes and garlic mashed potatoes. To drink I had green bud lights which kept coming all night. The food was decent but nothing to write home about. The steak was actually cooked to perfection and very flavorful.  The lobster was grilled so it came extremely dry. I had to peel it off the shelf so it looked like I was peeling a giant cock a roach.  Not the most appealing .  The parmesean potatoes were fried and they were not good. It seemed like they had gone to the fryer one too many times. The mashed potatoes were good. In all considering I was eating steak and lobster at Tgif for $23 it wasn't to bad of a deal.

We stacked everything and put it at the end of the table to even make it easy....she came and asked if we wanted another drink or if we were ready to tao out (it was our second drink) and we said we were no where near ready to tap. She came back and we all ordered our next round and she asked if we wanted our checks split or all together (didn't even asked if we wanted anything else). So we asked to split it since she could and when we got our bills we found out that our last round of drinks weren't on happy hour and we paid full price.

We ordered buffalo wings. Spinach dip, and baby back rib. I told them my brother is Neutropenic so he can't have raw vegetables on any of his food. Good thing I checked the order and noticed they mixed the raw veggies with his dinner. Sent it back. They fixed it. But when I brought the food to the hospital, I thought it was fixed but not the spinach dip still had raw vegetables garnished on top of the dip. So my brother couldn't eat that one. Called them, all I got was an apology . Second time my brother was admitted again, we ordered the same thing, again told them not to Mixed raw vegetables. Of course they did it again and had them fixed it . this time I doubled check . Third time my brother got hospitalized this time we ordered a side of fries and not realized fries was included with the meal. We retracted the order of fries but the waitress already rang us up. She said the sign the receipt and then she ll ring a new receipt. well the second receipt was more expensive and asked me to sign it, which of course I didn't sign because she never removed the order of fries and tries tells me some hogwash information that that's how they process the change of order. Not buying it and had manager re ring the whole thing and with a return receipt . This last one was just the worst. Called it in early, Angelica said it will be ready in 20miin. I waited before I go there so the food will be ready to go. We got there, she said she just handed it to the cook 5 min ago. Very disposing ben and she knows it. When it was time to pay she tells me my debit didn't swiped so she needed my iD. Why?? My brother end up paying. Hebwaithe waitress are clueless when it comes to take out. Does not pay attention and looks like they don't know what they are doing . Hence Angelica showed that.. they gave me the wrong order , you probably wonder why we come here? Because its closest to The hospital and our goal was to bring my brioche hot food but each time there's a problem and end up bringing my brother cold food. So this time we are done with tGIF.  We need a new place to go to give my brother good food beside the hospital food. We need a new place where food is tasty and so that he can't taste his medicine.

I've been to this location a few times and I either leave disappointed or just feeling okay. The service here is either a hit or miss with the majority time being a miss. The food is good but the service makes the dining experience bad. The last time I came here, I went to reserve a table for 7 since my group was five minutes away. As soon as I entered the restaurant, the four hostesses in the front (I don't know why there were 4) instantly stared me down giving me dirty looks. As I approached them, the main hostess had her phone out texting. I asked if I could reserve table for 7 since my party was almost here. One of the girls to my left constantly scanned me up and down trying to give off a tough persona. They all stayed quite for about 10 seconds and until the girl with the phone said ""okay"" and then basically ignored me and started taking the guy's info who was standing behind me. Right as I took a seat, the guy behind me came up saying ""they are calling you."" I look up and one of the girls said ""uh we need a name!"" I stood up and said ""Andrea."" Half way through saying my name, she interrupted in a stuck up voice, ""Thank you!"" Probably one of the rudest restaurant experiences of my life! Luckily our waitress was friendly but my salad took literally 30 minutes and my all of my friends endless appitizers took almost 20+ minutes for each order. The Cobb Salad, Mozzarella Cheesesticks, and Potato Skins are the only highlights that I've experienced here. They all are prepared correctly and are satisfying.

I've been going to this Fridays for a long time and I've never had any problems. Parking sucks sometimes when it's busy but the atmosphere and location make this a great happy hour destination. Food isn't great but they have good deals like the endless apps and happy hour. I like the jack Daniels strips and potato skins the most.  The waiter we got was friendly and helpful with the menu and drinks he thought we would like. My friend and I sat in the bar area because of convenience. There's plenty of seating which is nice too. We got our drinks and food in a reasonable amount of time. It's easy to drink a lot with their deals/service so watch yourself or call an uber. Sometimes the crowd gets stupid too so just be aware of the people around you.  I'll def be back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=140,2.92,2.75,2.628,2.548,2.8179999999999996

Now they have this new special, I think they have I items for $2, $4, $7+. I may be wrong on that part. I know for sure they have plates for $7. The baby back ribs that I got were only 13.99 and they came with two sides. Well when I ordered the server said it only came with one side but when it came out, I had two sides on my plate haha so maybe he forgot it really did come with two sides. The sides I chose was the baked potato and Mac n cheese. Surprisingly the Mac n cheese was really good. Because I am not too fond of their pasta here, I thought the Mac n cheese was going to be horrible.

We were greeted and were sat very quickly. Our server Bre took the kids order so the food would come out quick so they wouldn't have to wait. Great I thought. We ordered our Apps and drinks.  Ten minutes later our drinks came and two of our apps arrived. Great i'm thinking, no wait. Our server came back and took our entree order. Then we wait, and wait, and wait. The kids are getting hungry we're all out of chips for the spinach dip. A whole twenty minutes go by and our food comes out but not the kids. Ten minutes later Bre shows up and asks if we need anything else. I let her know that we didn't receive the kids meals. She apologizes and rushes to get the meal. Three minutes later my kids sad excuse for a hamburger shows up. The kids do not touch it but they do eat the cold fries. The hamburger is cold to the touch, so it has been in the expo window for over thirty minutes would be my guess.  Bre comes back and I voiced my concerns with the cold hamburger. She just says, in a dejected tone, ""Do you want another one or just comped?"" I said to just comp it since they filled up on the chips. Once we get our bill I noticed that I am being charged $7.99 instead of the $4.99 for the salad. I asked Bre why I was being charged? She stated that I ordered off the lunch menu, but after looking at the menu that was incorrect. Bre then stated that she was new and that she pressed the wrong button. So instead of just saying I pressed the wrong button let me fix that, she lies, and then I question myself on what was the actual price. I asked if she could fix it it. I placed my card in the bill and my friend was going to place his card. That's when the bill was already taken and we couldn't divide the bill. By the time she showed up, I was already charged, before I could validate the changes made. That's when I asked for the manager. The manager showed up, looking already annoyed that  I woke him up, as he was disheveled and looked more like a Shift Lead than a manager.  Anyways I let him know my concerns about the bill, and how I wanted it split. No apology was given and he said ""Well I already gave you the comp on the Kids meal and I gave you $1.00 off."" Basically it translated to what else do you want. I am so sad as I always enjoy eating there, and my friend and I have a great time. It just seems like management does not properly train their employees, or wait staff. I will say Bre did a great job trying to fix things, but she needs to table touch more frequently as this could have been resolved sooner.  Management seems useless.

She only ate part of a hamburger because she said that it tasted funny and the ingredients inside of it didn't look too appetizing. My salad was okay, what can you really do to a salad? The thing that really made this review 01 was the fact that the drinks were horrible. She went on the safe side and just got herself a draft beer. I decided to get adventurous and get a cocktail. The cocktail was really weak. When I asked him if they would be willing to fix it, they brought me a shot and told me to enjoy and they apologized. When I got the bill they charged me for the week drink and the shot. I was not told that I was going to get charged for  shot and if I would have known I would not have even order the shot in the first place. If the drink would have been made correctly in the first first place, I would not have ordered the shot. That was their way of hiking up a $10 drink to $20. My drink ended up being $20.

The problem was our spinach dip was cold, our boneless wings were also cold and a little undercooked so we sent those back, and then our last appetizer we tried was the potato skins and they were so overly deep fried that there was barley even any potato in the skin (if that makes any sense)...

The meal was not good, but fine, it's Fridays - I don't expect better from them and wouldn't bother to do a review based on that alone. When it came time to check out we used the Ziosk terminal at the table. Here is where things went wrong... We had a $32.40 bill, I took photos of two of the Ziosk-calculated tip amounts we observed: $7.00 even at 9.4%, and $14.83 at 20%. Now, go read that again! And again just to be sure. Yes, the Ziosk terminal is GREATLY FALSIFYING tip calculations. 9.4% is really $3.05 and 20% is $6.48. Apparently Fridays expects you to be 1) drunk, or 2) stupid, or 3) both, when it comes time to pay, Unfortunately many people are not so hyper-aware, or simply assume that a restaurant would not try to STEAL FROM THEM. But Fridays does.  How many years has this been going on? How many thousands of customers have they defrauded? p.s.

The String Bean Fries, were good.  I only tried one, but I liked it!  I think I would have preferred them dipped in Ranch, I think they were in some sort of mustardy sauce.   The bar was slow, and there were maybe 5 other people there most of the time we were.  The service, was even slower.  The bartender tried to give us someone elses food, and about 10 minutes later I asked him if he could please check on our food.  He came back with it, which just means it would have sat there until I said something eventually.  How come no one brings the far food orders out to the bar... Quite a few people ordered Steak and Lobster, which I guess was on special for $14.99... I just cant understand that. Anyway, the glass of house Chardonnay - Kendall Jackson was a good glass of wine.  Two appetizers that were half off, and two glasses of wine, for $25 didnt seem like much of a happy hour deal to me.  I didnt eat most of the nachos, the service was just fair... definitely would suggest going into one of the other restaurants inside the outdoor shopping area instead for... anything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4,2.84,2.67,2.64,1.704,2.7379999999999995

Friends and I came from saddle ranch to finish our night with more drinks and food. Great company and conversation for the most part but as I took my last bathroom break, I literally returned seconds after they called last call. I told the bartender I just came back and would like one more beer before they shut down. Even tho I was sitting right in front of the tap he told me no. In a very rude manner. The other bartender was ready and willing to help me but as he reached for my glass the guy in front of me cut him off and straight up said no. I'm never one to complain but this was a bit much. So I said ""oh okay, like that."" He then mumbled something and they both snickered. It's one thing to decline something but to insult me in front of my face is another.  Like I said, been here many times with no issue. Servers and food are okay. Bartenders need to be retrained on customer service. I work in the restaurant business, I understand it's late and we want to go home, but that type of attitude is never okay to someone who is there spending money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=40,2.2,2.45,2.6,2.6000000000000005,2.3500000000000005

It took about 15 minutes to get her to take our order and she only came over after we asked to talk to the manager. We requested another server because I wasn't going to sit all night waiting for service. The manager said we were have another server. The new guy came over and helped us 3 times then the other one came back and acted like she had never been replaced.  The food was bad. My daughter ordered the PARMESAN crusted chicken and when it was served it had a very strong lemon pepper smell and taste. My daughter can't tolerate so much pepper and couldn't eat the chicken. The worthless waitress said she will talk to the manager. When our check was brought it still had $14.99 for the chicken. I called her back over and asked WHY we are paying for the chixken, it was still sitting on my daughter's plate. She cut it up and took one tiny bite. The manager came over and got defensive of the doos. Saying the PARMESAN crusted chicken is made with a LEMON PEPPER crust. That's how it is made. It's supposed to taste like that. Then why call it PARMESAN? Call it LEMON PEPPER? After much back and forth with this manager I finally said, ""so we are expected to pay for this? Your resturant can't title food properly and an child almost eats a mouth full of pepper and that's ok? Fine....."" that's when she swiftly took the check and said it will be removed.

75,Chris N.,"Fountain Valley, CA",276,198,1895.0,3.0,2017-04-26,"I like this location a lot better than the one at Westminster Mall, but that actually doesn't mean much. This location was the first TGIF's I've ever tried; i was introduced to it by a family friend. We usually only go here for happy hour or after an Angels or Ducks game late at night. I've been here many times and the wait time fluctuates from no wait time up to 30 minutes. The service is really friendly but very slow and inattentive. The servers always provide us information about the menu and the happy hour but they take forever to refill drinks and  bring out the food.  When we come here during happy hour, most of the appetizers are half-off so we usually get the potato skins, cheeseburger sliders for $1.50 each, Jack Daniel traditional wings, chicken nachos, mozzarella sticks, and my favorite Jack Daniel boneless strips. The food took about 30 minutes to come out but we were still missing some of our orders. We had to notify our server  and they said they are going to check on it. The server came out to apologize that the order was never placed. We had to wait another 15 minutes. I felt like the only food items that were actually good today were the mozzarella sticks (cheesy and hot), traditional wings (juicy and tender), and the potato skins (crispy outer shell but soft inside potato). The cheeseburger sliders and Jack Daniel strips were overcooked so the meat was dry. The chicken nachos didn't seem freshly prepared.with ingredients tossed messily. Usually, all of the food is pretty good. Today was an off-night. Overall, the food is decent and their service is sub-par. They might close at 2AM but their kitchen closes earlier so make sure to order before they abruptly tell you that you can't order anymore. They have great happy hour menus and drinks at a good price. This location have different events for each day of the week. I believe that Wednesdays are karaoke night so I usually go up and sing when the drinks increase my confidence.

Ivette Navarro the manager and the waitress (I didn't get her name) treated me and my family very poorly to the point that they made my niece cry and called the cops on us because we supossively didn't order for them. Long story short there was 9 people in our party 5 of them were kids one was less than a year old and was sleeping the whole time the rest where under 12yrs old. So we ordered 7 orders of the endless apps and I ordered the cheeseburger sliders (which weren't on the endless apps) 8 orders in total. 7 endless appetizers, 5 for the kids 1 endless apps for an adult and a cheeseburger appetizer for me. My wife didn't even eat but she had a beverage. So everyone was accounted for Ivette Navarro the unprofessional manager said that we still had to order 2 extra endless appetizer because there was 9 in our party we told her there is only seven of us eating, the baby is asleep and my wife is not eating and I ordered an appetizer plate which is not included in the endless apps. But regardless 7 apps where ordered and gonna be payed for.  Ivette Navarro said that was unacceptable and everyone sitting down had to order and no sharing. I repeated to her everyone was accounted for and ordered for and she said that was unacceptable and if we don't order for the rest she would call the cops and eventually she did to the point that she made the kids cry and we had to leave. Other patrons told her that she was wrong for what she did and she didn't  care. Ivette Navarro should be fired because as a business owner I would never treat a paying customer like that.

Sadly the bartenders didn't know the prices of any of the drinks but that is not my reason for the one star. The reason is because for the whole time we sat there, about 2 hrs, not once did we see these bartenders (3) wash their hands once. They were wiping their hands on their jersey or their pants and continuing on making another drink, squeezing limes and getting beers. They also never once washed the mixer cups, we saw them make multiple Margaritas, a Hawaiian Drink and a midori sour all using the same unwashed glassware.

It was me and my older sister we walked in and we had a wait for the hostess to get off the phone so she can seat us, we got seated. Their menu book looks and feel like a cardboard and cheap. Then we got a waiter ider what was his name he was white and we both asked for water and he says that he has to ""check""  if they have any?  Like seriously what waiter says that like it sounds like a restaurant can't even afford water? Then we ordered a pasta, my sister got the pasta idk wat it was called with no shrimp and she  told the waiter that she's allergic to seafood and that she didn't want it on her plate or cooked with it. I ordered a the same thing but with shrimp. It took 35 minutes to receive our orders and the waiter didn't even apologize for for the wait that they took so long and my sister asked the waiter if the orders were cooked separately and that if it didn't have shrimp and he says he didn't heard what we said to him when we told him to his face? My sister she liked her food for me I didn't even like it at all. The pasta was shitty for me the shrimp was way too dry, didn't have a lot of flavor, it had less pasta instead they put more sauce which it was too oily for my taste. We had to use their device thing to call our waiter to ask for napkins and it took him almost 35 minutes to get any service is so unacceptable. Idk if the management hired people that don't even know how to cook, the waiters/waitresses to attend people very well, but I think they hired anybody that doesn't even have restaurant experience. For 17.99 each for almost 18 bucks is not worth the price, I honestly think it's a ripoff. It used to be 12 bucks now it's 17 bucks. It should have more food and flavor. But I think they're quality of their food has gone down that they don't put their effort on the orders since they raised their prices up to beat other restaurants (meaning every restaurant around their competitions). I used their coupon for 25 percent off it helped to avoid wasting money. If you want to get better food quality with better service go to El Torito instead of coming here not worth the wait or money. If you want something fast for your convenience go to Carl's Jr. I didn't even wanted to tip the waiter bc he took so long but I don't think I won't be back.

6,Kathy R.,"Anaheim, CA",0,28,1.0,2.0,2017-10-20,"We went there on a Thursday evening and the place was packed due to football and baseball games that were on.  We did not have to wait to long, 15 minutes or so for a table.  We ordered an Electric Lemondade and Long Island Tea which were both really good.  For dinner we ordered there 2 for $14.99.  My husband got the ribs and steak, I got the bacon-wrapped shrimp and steak.  My husband loved the ribs but said his steak tasted sour.  I tasted my steak and it also did not taste right.  Also, the bacon on my shrimp was maybe half way cooked.  Our waiter Johnathon was fantastic!  He took our steaks and asked if we wanted new ones, we said absolutely not and asked if we could get two sets of ribs to go since they were the only thing enjoyed at dinner and he said no problem.  When we got up to leave, my shoe was actually stuck to the floor.  It looked like the floor underneath the tables are never washed, they are black.  Also when we were leaving, the door to exit was sticky, gross!  I doubt we will be back there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=120,2.32,2.54,2.588,,2.452

Knowledgeable regarding the menu and suggestions, quick with good service. Truly wanted to make this dining experience a good one. I had the 2 items for $14.99. I chose the sirloin and bacon wrapped shrimp and the sides were lemon broccoli and crispy Brussels sprouts. The steak and shrimp were perfectly cooked, as was the broccoli. The Brussels sprouts tasted salty, probably from the sauce. Topped it off with a glass of Pinot noir. I will come back here for dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=60,2.36,2.57,2.604,,2.4859999999999998
125,Nader B.,"Anaheim, CA",0,9,,1.0,2017-10-30,"I went to dinner to this place, the food and service was good but right after i got home, I got real ill. we called and report it to the manager on duty and she said she will notify the kitchen people and will call me the next day to check up on me. two days went by and I received no call from them and when we called the restaurant, The manager on duty not only didnt know about the incident but keep referring me to call their general manager.. I called the health department and made a complaint and also called TGIF corp office... A lady from their corp. office called and left a massage on my voice mail that she was the director of operation and to call her back. I called the number and left a detailed message and never heard back from them. My main concern was a bacteria outbreak food poisoning like the one with chipotle, didn't want anyone else to get sick and also just a call back from whomever to check up on me to make sure i didn't die. These people don't care about people, they only care about up-selling you and collecting cash. Wellness call back wouldn't cost them anything and I would probably would of give them a second chance.

116,Connie B.,"Chino Hills, CA",63,12,1.0,1.0,2017-10-30,We had dinner here.  My husband and I had something different. My husband had a burger and became very ill. He was so sick by the time we left Fridays  and came straight home. I called Fridays and told the manager what happened.  She said she would look into it and call me back the next day to check up on him. I never got a call.  I called them 2 days later and a manager told me to call the district office.  No one had any concern about my husband and no one asked how he was. I called corporate and played phone tag and as of today it's been a month and no follow up.  I DON'T RECOMMEND FRIDAYS AT ALL.  I would have given them another chance had they would have at least shown a little compassion.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=40,2.24,2.57,2.596,,2.438
114,Crystal S.,"Anaheim, CA",0,39,21.0,1.0,2017-11-06,"Our waiter was good, but food was a total disaster. My husbands salad had burnt onion strings.. totally dark brown and hard. Our pot stickers were very burnt on both sides like BLACK, the potato skins were gross and the cheese wasn't even melted. The wings tasted old and ridiculously hard. My pecan crusted chicken wasn't even crispy at all.. it looked and tasted microwaved, same thing for the chicken in my husbands salad. The mashed potatoes were cold and tasted like they came out of a box. HORRIBLE! TGI Fridays has definitely gone down hill. Still can't believe they felt comfortable sending out food like that!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=40,2.2,2.54,2.592,,2.404
267,Priscila H.,"Southeast Anaheim, Anaheim, CA",34,5,1.0,1.0,2017-11-06,"Is it just me, or does almost every server at this Fridays look like they hate their life? I think I just always have bad luck with this location. I don't think I've ever genuinely had a nice or caring server here unless it was a manager themselves assisting in serving the food and checking up on us. I usually only come here for the appetizers since its the only part of the menu I like to eat. You would think only having to serve appetizers would be a simple task, and maybe I just always catch the servers here on a bad day, but they take FOREVER to bring out a plate of mozzarella cheese sticks or 4 chicken wings. It's kind of disappointing. In my recent visit to this location, we were told no take out bags for the ""Endless Appetizers"" promotion. Fine. We didn't need any. We all got our own plates and naturally wanted to share food with each other since it was all finger food. Our waitress was hovering over us the entire time which I thought was just her being attentive to whether we needed more water, anything else, etc. Instead, she comes up to us and tells us that because a member of our party ate half of an appetizer another member of our party had ordered, she would have to pay for an entire other meal. WTF?! Read over the tiny black print at the bottom of the menu and yes, no take out boxes, yes, only one plate at a time, but absolutely no mention of not being able to share. Not to mention it took our waitress over 15 minutes to bring out one small plate and she intentionally waited till I finished my plate till she brought out my friend's food. The fact that she was willing to make another member of our party wait so long for her food just to enforce some rule she made up is BS. Not the first time I've had to wait what felt like ten years for an appetizer and was treated poorly at this location. I doubt I'll be returning. Great managers at this location but there's something else going on because that attitude isn't reflected amongst their staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=100,2.16,2.5,2.58,,2.364

She should stay at home with that gross attitude. I always have to ask multiple times for things, rolls her eyes constantly, and refused to clear the table as new plates were coming out.
