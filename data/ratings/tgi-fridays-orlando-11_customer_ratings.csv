There was a weird cleaner smell that wasn't pleasant.  I was beginning to regret suggesting this place, but stayed due to time constraints. I asked for the gluten free menu and it was abysmal.  First of all it pretty much says ""We don't  REALLY offer Gluten Free items because we refuse to set an area aside for you""  Fine...  I had a flight to catch and no time to really go anywhere else.  I can handle A TINY BIT of cross-contamination.  This is a national chain, so you would have thought they would at least try.  The menu (gluten free)  had a few items but all were fleshcentric and items that really are just naturally made without flour or gluten.  But, you have to LOVE meat or you are screwed.  Which meant I was pretty much screwed.  So I get the tomato soup and a salad (so exciting) and halfway through my soup I find a french fry in it.  That in itself is well...gross since you don't know exactly where that fry came from.  A half-eaten plate being handled above my food?  A lazy cook who just flings stuff all over? This really didn't bode well for my ""gluten free"" choices.

We continue to inform them that's it's a party of 6 and we'd really prefer to sit outside. The hostess walks outside and simply nods her head no. She keeps walking thru the diner and we follow to see if she's gonna take us outside thru another door or something. She then stops and we kinda just stood around in confusion. We asked if we were gonna sit inside or something and she said that was our table in a somewhat rude way in return to our confusion. We got sat next to the bathrooms which we tried to switch, but saw no employee around to do so. We just stood up and switched tables to the next big  open table away from the bathrooms but still in the bar area. It honestly took 15 minutes just to get greeted. We put in our drink order and it took another 15-20 minutes to get our drinks. The appetizers arrived about 10 minutes after ordering which is cool, but aren't the drinks supposed to get there first?  We were done w apps and ready for more apps before the drinks were even being made. Basically due to the slow service we only had time for 3 drinks and two apps in a 2.5 hr span. I would return there because of the drink specials, but only if it had better service.

We have gone to Friday's literally every day for a week now. We noticed that Friday's fixes their reward program to where you cannot get points quick enough. What that means is you have to wait a week to post more than 2 receipts. No other restaurant does this. When I asked Raseesh if I need to take my business elsewhere he replied with ""come in tonight and we will comp an entree"". First the bartender told me and my friends the manager said he couldn't find the note from the previous manager and they can't comp endless apps. Friday's is obviously hurting. Do you know of a Friday's with good service? They can't keep one owner and the Internet is filled with more complaints than positives. But I digress. I ask for the manager, the GM, who obviously is frustrated with his job and has anger management issues. Because after I asked why the bartender said there was no note, he said ""he didn't say that to you"". First of all, you don't argue with a guest and you don't speak in a hostile tone with anyone. Let alone a customer. After we pointed out that we all heard the same thing, he says ""we don't comp endless apps"". So I will be taking my business elsewhere from now on.  No wonder this location has bad service.

A whole lot of items on the menu, but the place suffers from a bit of menu dejavu --- like you see ""Jack Daniels chicken"" in what seems like 11 different places on the menu. Almost as if someone decided that they would have three meat options, and then came up with 20 ways to serve each of those.

This place is pretty cool, the one in New York is better cause every Friday they have a DJ but I mean not my number one spot to go to but nice to have close to home. The happy hour here as to drinks are good and the apps are great, the fact they have the $10 all you can eat apps is great and they have a new bucket apps. Since I've been here the service is good but I'll tell you one thing, this place is good to come and eat but when it comes to online or over the phone ordering it is horrible. The times I've put a online or phone order they have always messed up my order, either they forget an order or just got the order wrong. So I will never again put another online or phone order I rather go there and eat. I have to say the mozzarella sticks and pot stickers are really good also they have these new chicken tacos which are very good and an entrée the best thing I've had here so far is the sizzling chicken and cheese with mashed potatoes those are amazing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-11,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

When we finally get seated, our server, Ryan, constantly forgot what we ordered. My son sat there crying, and his food never came. I was highly upset with the neglect, so I asked for a box so I could take my food to go. I know Friday's is better then this. Maybe just not this Friday's.

Service was a little on the slow side, but it was a fairly busy night and the kitchen had its challenges. I don't blame the server. My only real complaint is the music was blaring so loudly that we had to shout to be heard across the table. If I want to listen to loud music, I'll go home and listen to music I like. The restaurant is close to the airport and it's a good place to wait for a visitor's flight to arrive.

So we asked another server and Wallah! drinks came and our food - but the drinks arrived watered down..  and a meal was missing ONE item.  so waiter snatched the entire plate and hurried away.   the waiting began again. Server kept blowing past us, and we waited.  It finally came back a different meal... arrrgh!   We sent it back, requested mgmt and we complained. Drinks were refused and Mgmt was going to fix the meal issue.  We waited and waited and waited. finally they did it right this time.  By then hunger had been replaced with frustration and we just paid for what was eaten and BUT WAIT!!,  we had to wait and wait and wait for our card and receipt!!!...

We had a large party (9 adults and 3 kids with 2 in high chairs) and was a little disappointed that they didn't have the space to put us all together at 1 table so we were at 2 separate tables.  The bummer of the night was that my friends mom left her card after paying and we called the restaurant back (about 20mins after leaving) to check and see if anyone turned it in and was left on hold for what seemed like forever, so we just drove back over. When we let the host and another server know why we were back, they seemed a little confused on what to do.  The host even asked for my friends moms drivers license like she was going to compare her name to the card they'd found, but when we asked if they had found it she says they hadn't. Sooo why would you ask for her license?! Very confusing. Anyways our server was kind enough to move the tables and chairs to see if it had fallen and even checked all of the black bill fold books - nothing.
