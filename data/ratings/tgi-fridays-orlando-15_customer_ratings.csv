23,Sam B.,"Phoenix, AZ",6,86,27.0,5.0,2012-03-21,"This location gives stripes reward members free chips and salsa!  Plenty of other location don't (UCF is the worst).  Have come here probably 20+ over the past couple years; service, food, and price point are always very good.  On the rare occasion something didn't come out as I had hoped, the server and manager bent over backwards to make it right for me.  Even though this is near the mall, this is not a crappy tourist spot.  Would highly recommend over the typical 'mall food'.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-15?start=20,,,,,
24,Ron G.,"College Park, Orlando, FL",0,2,,2.0,2012-09-29,"Had a business lunch for 4 on Wednesday and I ordered the Endless Lunch. The order comes with breadsticks. The person that brought the bread out, put it in the middle of the table and walked off. There were 2 sticks on the plate. I knew they were with my order but she put them in the middle of the table for everyone. Did I mention there were 4 of us, and only 2 breadsticks?  Awkward!  Anyway, I received my Caesar Salad and soup..the salad was wilted, the soup was ok...service was poor. Oh well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-15?start=20,,,,,
21,Virgilio R.,"Passaic, NJ",10,5,1.0,4.0,2013-07-18,"TGIF I have always like to go there. I think the food is decent and so are the prices. Normally it was a 3 star rating for me but the staff was much more friendly than normal here. No rush to make you order like in other places, the waiter made suggestions to make the orders more personalized to our taste from what he had over heard us talking about what we like and didn't, so very attentive to what we wanted.So the extra star was all the waited on here. we didn't even have to ask for extra napkins,he brought them over and asked if we would like some cause most people ask. That is like taking it to the next step being so attentive that you knew what we wanted before we asked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-15?start=20,,,,,
19,Ryan W.,"Orlando, FL",36,15,1.0,1.0,2013-08-08,"To make it simple and to the point. This place is a straight up disaster all around!! Service bad & very chaotic and unprofessional. Food looked like it was thrown on a plate, flies were everywhere, the mens restroom was disgusting! This list could go on! Just stay far away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-15,,,,,
13,Jennifer T.,"West Palm Beach, FL",30,53,13.0,1.0,2013-08-20,I like Friday's and have always received good service at all the ones I have gone to... except this one.  I have been here at least 4-5 times and every time is just an experience of frustration.  The staff is more interested in socializing than doing their job. Wait staff sitting down at tables with their friends. Bartenders goofing off.  The last straw was when my sons drove 3 hours to have dinner with me on my birthday. We sat for 30 mins and no one came to our table. Even after asking 2x for someone. We finally left and went to Outback down the street and received  excellent service.  I will never go back to this Friday's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-15,,,,,
7,Mark C.,"Orlando, FL",169,472,654.0,2.0,2013-11-17,"Their lunchtime deal brought us in. Buy a meal and two drinks get a meal free.  Sorry but I felt ""baited"" when the two un sweet teas we ordered cost $5.36. I typically only order water when eating out by choice (if no alcoholic), not by cheap. Whatever- I just won't ever be back after that little surprise. So we split their Triple Ruben and theirJack D.Burger. So glad we did too.The Ruben was a good sandwich, but the burger was gassy flavored. Grill issues that need attention. Fries were warm and the tea, stole the  meal as it was sooooo delicious, I happily pay anything to cop a serving!! Service attention in the bar (table) was okay, but tended on the slow side.  I see on the receipt if I give my opinion on line, I will get a free appetizer - no mandatory stupid priced drink required. Never say never? Nah, that free ain't worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-15,,,,,
17,Harold P.,"Buford, GA",25,17,,1.0,2014-07-14,"One star is being generous for the level of service I got here. I am in Orlando for a business trip and stopped here for the second night in a row. Both nights were equally as bad (shame on me for going back).  SUUUUPER slow service. The first night, I spent more time with an empty glass than one with any liquid. The second night, my sizzling chicken and shrimp was more like a warm plate of chicken and shrimp on a bed  of solidified cheese. If you're going here, go in with the expectation to be upset at how terrible the service is about to be, and maybe... just maybe... you won't be as disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-15,,,,,
10,Dorea M.,"Orlando, FL",55,95,18.0,3.0,2014-09-27,I am a regular at TGI Fridays. You can always count on good service and a variety of tasty food choices. Today's experience was average. We had an awesome and friendly server however she had too many tables that impacted timely service. I was surprised by the fact that my Cesar salad came without dressing and the hostess did not believe me at first and then took the salad back to the kitchen rather than just bringing out dressing...strange. My only other food complaint was my sweet potato fries had way too much salt seasoning and I had to send them back. One of the best things I like about this place is the stripes reward program. If you are not a member join as it's definitely worth it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-15,,,,,
16,Jennifer K.,"Cypress, CA",191,11,3.0,1.0,2014-10-03,"I should have checked the reviews before coming to this TGI Friday. It was really cold and the service was horrible. The food constantly came in late, (We ordered the endless appetizers) and twice, the food was cold. We hardly saw our server even though the place wasn't busy. Overall, the worst TGIF restaurant I've ever been to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-15,,,,,
11,Jake H.,"Painesville, OH",172,2,2.0,1.0,2015-01-19,Possibly the worst Fridays I've ever been to. Be ready to wait at least a Hour for your food. Service was terrible. Was checked on once and that was to order. Stay away unless they fire the whole staff and start fresh with people that might give a shit. Needless to say no tip was give.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-15,,,,,
15,David C.,"Corpus Christi, TX",4,9,3.0,5.0,2015-02-17,The bartender was great. The place was busy Friday night so we went to the the bar and while waiting the bartender was so friendly that we skipped our table to eat there. She was busy the whole time we were there and she never forgot to check in with us time to time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-15,,,,,
6,Daniela L.,"Lutz, FL",237,131,410.0,1.0,2015-03-02,"I HATE giving any establishment a one star, but sadly this Friday's earned it. I've been to a ton of places across the country and had a variety of service.  I have to say this is the WORST service I've ever had at any restaurant or establishment I've been to. It pains me to say it because I really liked this location as they had an awesome waiter named, Stan that my hubby and I really liked. I guess it's been a few years and quality has gone way down. THE SERVICE: As soon as we entered we saw a few folks waiting yet not many people sitting...it wasn't busy at all. There was no host. After about 5 minutes he finally came by and walked right past us,  no eye contact, didn't take our name, he just grabbed the next family sitting and walked away. After another few minutes a waitress came by and the hubby asked if we could just sit at the bar high tops as the host hadn't even taken our name. She was nice enough to clean a table for us and seat us. When a waitress came by it started well enough. I ordered the Jack Daniel's burger, husband ordered the endless apps and an entree.  After she bought drinks, that was pretty much it. She came by one more time after about 15 minutes to ask if our apps had arrived. They had not. She ran back to the kitchen and a few  minutes later our flat-bread came out with no apology for the long wait or even small plates. At this point I realized we had developed mutant super powers of invisibility as no one acknowledged us. ""Honey, isn't it great? I've always wanted the ability to enter an establishment without being noticed."" So the point of endless apps is that they are pretty much endless. We waited for her to come by to ask us what refill we wanted on the apps, but she never even acknowledged us after quickly seeing that we got the apps. At this point our meals arrived. I asked the lady who brought them for ranch and she never came by again. POWERS OF INVISIBILITY, ACTIVATED! The rest of that hour the waitress would give us a casual glance but not come by the table, she would walk right past us and not say a word. In an hour we had NO drink refills or even a ""How is everything""? Our power was clearly too strong as it also managed to create a force field around our table as she actively went around the bar to avoid our table.   When she finally walked by my husband asked for another app and asked her to place another order after that (He figured since service was going to be this slow he might as well). The look she gave us was a cross between disgust and annoyance with a touch of an audible sigh. After she left my husband and I looked at each other like, ""Did she just do what I think she did?"" She did. We were imposing on her and she made that pretty clear. I was too scared to ask for a drink refill or napkins. Since I was invisible I went to the host section and got my own napkins. Couldn't do my own drink refill since I had no idea where that was. At that point I felt pretty bad, I've never had such rotten service. I told the hubs it was time to go. He told her to cancel the orders and asked for the check. At this point she feigned caring, ""OH, is everything OK""? UGH. My husband was paying with a gift card and that took forever as she didn't know how to input it and as of right now we have still been charged for the meal. The manager came out and apologized for their waitress who is ""usually our best"". I guess we got lucky that night. I eventually waited in the car and teared up like a baby. I've never cried over bad service before...this is how bad the service was. THE FOOD: Meh. They must have changed the Jack Daniel's recipe because the burger tasted and looked like a hockey puck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-15,,,,,
8,Samantha M.,"Orlando, FL",5,13,3.0,5.0,2015-03-14,"$12 endless apps were delicious and we loved the variety! The food was delicious, the drinks over poured (not a complaint, lol) and the service was excellent!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-15,,,,,
4,Silvia V.,"Middle Village, Queens, NY",0,2,,1.0,2015-06-13,"Terrible service, especially on a Friday.. Considering this place is called Friday's..

12,Sodikbek I.,"Fullerton, CA",52,10,17.0,1.0,2015-06-17,"Fist time here. I have read all the reviews before came. But still want a try this place. Because this is a closest place for me.

14,Chuck W.,"Racine, WI",0,8,,2.0,2015-08-26,"Really disappointed. Our group of 11  including 2 children under age 5 went in on Sunday August 16, 2015. We arrived just before Noon and the place was a ghost town. We got our drinks in reasonable time.  The server took our order, the apps came out but the food did not. I finally asked to see the manager. He was sweating profusely. My gut feeling is he was helping in the kitchen. I asked why it was taking so long for our food.  He looked stunned. It turns out that at TGIF,  when the server puts the order in the POS,  the cook's can only see the appetizers. They cannot see the entrées until the guests have decided that they no longer want any more appetizers.  Then the  entrees become visible to the cook's. I told the manager that was ludicrous.  We have always been asked when to start bringing out the entrées,  especially when children are part of the group. He agreed.  When the food did come out the server tried to convince my wife that a Caesar salad was the Chicken Cobb that she had ordered. The manager quickly exchanged it for the correct salad.. He did comp us one appetizer. He also gave us a coupon for a free appetizer. Overall the food was tasty and plentiful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-15,,,,,
18,J G.,"Orlando, FL",0,8,,2.0,2015-10-17,"Beware of drink prices!  There is a reason why the drink menu doesn't include pricing because they don't want you to know the drink costs until after you finish the drink and receive your bill, by then it's too late.  We opted for a simple sangria vs. a specialty drink only to find out the sangria was $10.89 which was more than most other drinks and was the same cost as the meal.  We were shocked and disappointed, the waiter didn't really care when we raised the issue, so in the end, we will have the final say because we won't return again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-15,,,,,

1,Sharon C.,"Atlanta, GA",244,301,1498.0,2.0,2016-05-06,"Haven't been here in such a long time and tonight was a reminder of just why. This wasn't my first choice of food for the night, however, my company was not dressed as nice as I was so we opted here.  I ordered a Ribeye with broccoli and mac n cheese. The Ribeye was either old and reheated, chewy and tough to eat. I had to have them take away which I hate to do. I have had steak here before and don't remember it ever being like that.  The manager came over to see if he could re do another steak which was appreciated. The other food was an assortment of apps. I didn't have any but all of it was super breaded to the max and didn't look appetizing at all.  I ate my broccoli and I enjoyed my skinny blueberry mojito which was very good.  We sat outside and out waiter who seemed to also be one of the bartenders was very attentive and nice. So I basically had 2 pieces of broccoli and a mojito for dinner! At least I'll be happy with what my scale says tomorrow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-15,,,,,
