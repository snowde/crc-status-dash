2,Mo A.,"Washington, DC",3757,414,2038.0,3.0,2012-01-13,"I'm gonna disclose and say that generally speaking I don't like TGI Fridays.  So much so that I'm offended that their company name incorporates a day of the week that brings so many people happiness and relief.  I've also contemplated filing a lawuit seeking that they change their name to TGI Monday....which in my humble opinion is probably more fitting given their lame food and horrible service.   Annnyyyywayyyyyyys, that brings me to this location.  Guess what?  I actually like it!  Yes, the food sucks but that's a franchise pattern.  The difference is it's a huge place that offers friendly service and......they actually have a game room!  A place where I can actually shoot hoops or engage in video game activity that allows me to channel my frustration over them getting my order wrong for the third time.  Also, being in the land of Mickey doesn't hurt either.  Air hockey anyone?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-2,,,,,
0,Lisa E.,"Orlando, FL",78,29,39.0,3.0,2013-04-22,"I've eaten at a few TGI's before and they've always had decent food. I ate at the location on I-Drive a few weeks ago and just ordered a Mudslide. Tasted mostly like a milkshake, which I had no complaints about, so I liked it even though it was super pricey (something I expected though). Our server was a nice guy - friendly and attentive. For being a chain restaurant on touristy I-Drive, it was a good experience. I definitely like going to TGI Fridays better than going to some other chain restaurants, although there are much better local places to go for a good meal at similar prices (Teak Neighborhood Grill comes to mind - about 10 minutes away with fantastic burgers).  If you have a picky party or are limited in choice for some other reason, you could do a lot worse. Maybe not somewhere to go out of the way for, but it's enjoyable nonetheless. =)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-2,,,,,
3,Coco P.,"Lawrence, KS",0,6,,4.0,2013-10-01,"Staff was very friendly and helpful. Tostada nachos were slightly burned and ""under-cheesed"" but still good. Fried green beans were surprisingly good with a great dipping sauce to compliment. The yukatan salad was very tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-2,,,,,
