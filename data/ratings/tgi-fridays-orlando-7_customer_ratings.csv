We got hungry and munched on some great food to complete our night.  Our waitress was super sweet and she made sure that we were happy with everything.  The captain morgan island rum punch was lovely.  I had to stop at one or else I would of been walking out like a pirate.  We started out with the spinach dip for the appetizer and moved on to some delicious sandwiches.  I settled for the BBQ pulled pork sandwich and my husband got one of the burgers.  My sandwich came with mashed potatoes with onion rings on the side per request.  The sauce that it came with was yummy.  I oozed it all over the meat.  Mmmmmm!  We shared a peanut butter pie for the ending.  What a way to end a long day :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-7?start=60,2.352,2.352,2.352,2.352,2.352

The bartenders are super friendly. This is the first time I met bartenders introducing themselves! I was also impressed they remembered our names! I usually dislike being called by name by total strangers, but this made the visit personal! We had the fantastic Jack Daniels starter. And mozzarella sticks. It was a mistake ordering two starters plus entrées! All the starters are big enough for two to share. We didn't know and couldn't finish. Pulled Pork sandwich - super tasty!  Being from Sweden where sweet potato is uncommon, we always go for that side whenever on the menu. Try those fries instead of regular fries. We shared dessert and went for Chocolate peanut butter pie - heavenly!  TGIF does not have the same menu in Stockholm, Sweden! One thing I like about this place is, that is is close enough for a walk from HGVC at Sea World.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-7?start=40,2.484,2.484,2.484,2.484,2.484

On this particular occasion it was T.G.I.F's. I'm not a frequent diner of TGIF's but I know the signs to look for. Nostalgic randoms slapped up on the walls. Red and white checker tables. Pouty teenagers working the hostess station. Something about potato skins.  Well, to my surprise the decor was not like thrift store yammied all over the walls. The decor was dark, tasteful. Limiting the junk art. Points! The layout of the restaurant was complimentary also. Enough tables to go around so that there wasn't a wait. Service was great. Tables were made of real wood. Not sticky and but very clean.  TGIF's has a huge boner crush on Jack Daniels BBQ sauce as it appears in most dishes. I kept it light and went with a Cobb salad. Not too shabby!

We went on a Saturday afternoon at 1:45.  The lunch crowd was mostly gone and there were multiple parties left in the restaurant, but basically finishing up.  There were open tables but we (as a party of five) still waited a few minutes. We all ordered what we thought to be quick , simple meals.  Soups, salads, a club sandwich.  No big entrees, no meats to cook.  Our order was taken at 2pm, one person got his salad at 3pm, and the rest of us got our meals (including other salads) at 3:30pm.  What??!!!  Three of us ordered soups and there was no spoon in the roll of silverware, so we asked for spoons and the waitress brought dirty spoons out to us.  Now I understand that silverware may not be sparkling after the dishwasher - I'm not usually a stickler for looking 'nice' - but one spoon had food crusted on a good portion of the spoon, and another still had sauce on it from someone else's meal.  My sister hates to ever voice a complaint but even she was moved to ask for a new spoon. My chicken noodle soup was peppery, and the California Club sandwich was pretty sad - much closer to a premade sandwich that you'd find in a gas station than anything I'd ever expect in a restaurant.  Why did this take an hour and a half during a slow part of the day?

We split a few of the small appetizers (the 3 for 15). We had the seared tuna, pork tacos, and fried Mac and cheese with bacon. They were all pretty good, the fried Mac and cheese was probably the best out of the 3. For my meal I had the jack Daniels half rack of ribs and 6 oz sirloin which comes with two sides. I loved it!

54,Don I.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",0,1,,1.0,2015-09-19,"I had a horrible experience today at the TGI Friday's at 10811 International Drive. Before I came to the restaurant, my girlfriend called and asked if they had the $10 endless appetizers. The person who answered the phone said yes and we went to the restaurant. When I first walked in, I was told to sit at the bar, even though I requested a table seat. Realizing that my choice was not taken seriously, I obliged and sat the bar. While at the bar, the bartender informed us of $12 appetizers, which was a better deal. After sitting at the bar for about two minutes, it became very uncomfortable and I asked them to move to me a table. The hostess informed us it would be a ten minute  wait. Twenty minutes later, my girlfriend and I were walked over to our seats. Our server, Jessica, came and we requested the endless appetizers. We also questioned her about the $12 appetizers. She said that that restaurant did not sell the endless appetizers at all because they were a corporate restaurant and not a franchise. We informed her that we had just called right before we came. She states that she has worked at this location for years, and unless the menu was recently changed, they did not have endless appetizers at the location. We requested her to ask someone else. She became upset, and by her body language we could tell she was frustrated that we would dare question her knowledge of the menu. She went to talk to the manager, Nadeem, and came back about ten minutes later. She said they did have the endless appetizers but they only had the potato skins and boneless wings. I informed her the bartender told us there were more options and once again she became frustrated. She stormed off and came back about eight minutes later and said they had more options. She named the options. We were ready to order and asked her once again about the $12 appetizers. She said they did not have that option. Again we requested her to speak to someone else. Once again, she stormed off to talk to someone else. She came back about five minutes later and said that they did have that option. At this point, I don't feel comfortable with her serving my food and went to speak with the manager. I expressed my concern to the manager about her behavior and lack of knowledge of the menu. He stated that he was unable to switch the server. While speaking to Nadeem, the manager, Jessica butted in with her arms crossed. I expressed to her that I did not not want her as my server due to her behavior. She started saying she was not frustrated and tried to put on a fake smile. I informed her I wanted another server. While speaking to her, another server, Christopher pulled her and told her to walk away after seeing her frustration. As I was speaking to he manager, I again expressed that I did not want her as a server. While speaking to the manager, I asked Christopher a question in regards to Jessica's behavior. Christopher became upset and with an attitude claimed he was not there. He raised his voice, went on the defense and like a child, said he wasn't going to speak to me at all. Mind you, this all occurred in the presence of the manager, who never asked his employees to act in a professional manner. During the entire ordeal, nobody apologized. Jessica did not apologize for the misinformation and her taking out her frustration out on us. Christopher did not apologize for raising his voice and his immature behavior. Nadeem did not apologize for the actions taken by his employees.

37,Mike L.,"Orlando, FL",0,2,,1.0,2015-11-03,"We were at this TGIF location on Thursday 10/29 and we were very disappointed with the level of service. Our waiter (Lucas) was in a hurry the entire evening. There was very little introduction, simply rushing to our drink and food orders. My beer took about 15 minutes to arrive after I had ordered it, Lucas had not come back once in that time period. Both our appetizer and main course were delivered to the wrong table when they came out. It was obvious that the outdoor seating area was being mismanaged as many tables were receiving wrong orders. Following our meal we were handed the bill by Lucas. As he seemed he was in a rush I figured I would not look at the bill before giving him my card, I would simply verify it was the correct amount once I was ready to sign. I've never had an issue with this method before, I tend to trust in people until they prove otherwise (especially at a reputable establishment). As I was about to sign I noticed that he added 20% gratuity to the total amount purposely and swiped the card for that amount. He circled the 20% gratuity amount he added and drew an arrow to the new total that he swiped. I understand when the party is six or more that an 18% gratuity is typically added. However we were a party of two and 20% was added. I then noticed on the merchant copy that he added an additional $1.50 on top of the incorrect amount. Yes, the merchant copy was different than the customer take-home copy. As I was reviewing he clearly noticed from inside that I was investigating the error, when all of a sudden he decided to come out to our table and explain...which is interesting since that was probably the 4th time total he had seen us all night. The entire night he had not bothered to ask us how we were or how the food was. He went back in and corrected the total and attempted to sound sincere when apologizing. Typically I would be sympathetic and take it as a common/accidental mistake. However, this was not accidental. He clearly knew what he was doing when he swiped our amount, hand wrote and circled the amount he wanted to add (thinking he was making it ""easy"" for us), and acting as if he was in a big hurry so that we would not notice this mistake. Clearly this was not a mistake with how smooth and nonchalant his apology was...almost as if this were not a big deal and was very routine. There was no genuine tone or body language shown towards his apology at all. This is simply asinine, pathetic and shameful. As a local here in Orlando knowing that this is a tourist location where many domestic and international travelers visit it's saddening to know that this waiter is attempting to steal money in a very deceiving fashion. I'm positive there are many visitors that simply sign away assuming the amount is what it is and not thinking anything of it. I was just lucky enough to catch it before signing.  Unfortunately the response by the manager to our phone call the day after was no better...ignoring the fact that something very wrong occurred, not even taking the time to consider it. Once again, I live here in Orlando and I fully support our strong tourism and the businesses that service it. I'm not a believer in negativity towards a business unless it's absolutely deserved. However, this is undoubtedly deserved. I strongly caution you about going to this TGIF as there are unethical practices occurring.

Sent back Burger #2: a little better cook, has pickles on it, still no mayo. I don't do pickles, and the juice gets all over the burger.

As he was walking out with my second appetizer I looked up from my table and he was hiding what he chose from me behind his hand. It again, made me giggle and he smiled because he was being slick. I love the interaction Nate and I had. He was and continued to be very professional.  I couldn't wait for my Yelp review to be finished, I had to tell the manager about my experience so far.

Unfortunately, we had a 15 minute wait even though there were a ton of open tables and booths available. The bathrooms (both men's and women's) were very dirty, promoting my wife to mention their conditions to the wait staff. The staff appeared to be in over their heads because they were scrambling around looking to fill table that were obviously open and ready for us. Maybe they didn't have enough waitresses...I'm not sure. We were finally told that there weren't enough menus, which is why our seating was delayed. Finally, a table was cleared for us although we had to ask for silver ware. 3 members of our party got the endless appetizers ($10), which is a pretty good value considering many of the appetizers are $9 by themselves. Unfortunately, they didn't have any Jack Daniels BBQ sauce for the boneless wings. My wife ordered the flat iron steak. The initial round of appetizers came in just 15 minutes, but after 30 minutes, my wife's steak still didn't arrive. I asked for the manager, and after 5-10 minutes, he showed up with the steak and an apology. He also took the charge for the steak off the bill. The steak was cooked well, and the appetizers were good. Nothing real special, but we weren't looking for a 5 star meal.

Last time was t too great so we were hoping this time it would be better run. We were wrong.Arrived at about 730 PM and was told it would be a 20 minute wait. When I walked to the bathroom I noticed about half the restaurant was empty yet they had about 5 families waiting for tables which did not make much sense to me. I am not sure if this restaurant has a staffing issue and that might be the reason why. As soon as you walk in the hostess almost force you to sit at the bar as all the tables are open seating by the bar. After about 30 mins of waiting we asked to clean a table by the bar and decided to sit there.  The waiter came and took our order. 3 of us did the unlimited appetizers and the waiter was nice enough to take our next round of appetizers so we can get them back to back. One of the main reasons I come to Friday's is for their Jack Daniels sauce. When I asked for boneless wings with jack Daniels I was told there was no jack Daniels sauce. How does a Friday's not have jack Daniels sauce??? Someone in our party ordered the steak with vegetables since they are doing the Atkins diet.  Plates started to come out and we all got our appetizers plus  the next rounds and the person in our party with the steak did not get hers yet. When asked about it the waiter stated "" some things cook faster than others."" Asked for a manager and that still took about 15 mins and when he came he continently had the steak. Taste on the steak was not that great. Appetizers were good as usual. I am a big fan of Friday's and usually go to the one at Waterford but for some reason this Friday's is poorly run with the empty tables, long wait times, and long time for food to be ready.
