Over all the chain has re-branded itself by getting much better food choices and updating the old Fridays look.  The staff at this location is pretty solid, never came across bad service.  I have to say, I am most impressed by the stripes program! This rewards program they have set up really adds up quick. It's almost every time I go I can get something free or discounted! Love that!  Also, most days they have a special that is half off of something and it turns out to be a great bargain!  Lately I've been ordering from the new small plates menu, the portions are still decent and food is some of the better Fridays fair!

However, I can't help but plug the amazing service we had here on the last occasion! Since I've been here, we've had wrong orders, bad service, missing orders, etc etc. But this time, it was like a new business! Our server, Mike, was in training, but fantastic. We even stopped to let the manager know how great he was. Very kind, quick, friendly, and all around great experience! I do like what they've done to the menu, as well. Rustic look with lots of photos, and it makes it look like there are more options. However, TGIF needs to determine if they're a family-friendly restaurant or a place for late nights. The first SIX pages of the menu are drinks and appetizers. What about having two menu's - one for the bar (with those in the front) and one for dining (with those in the back)?

We had coupons, but the server kept trying to 'upsell' us and one time even said that we would need to buy an entrée for the coupon to be valid!! (which was not the case). Luckily, my wife had the presence of mind to ask the waitress to kindly read the coupon. For appetizer, we ordered Ahi Tuna Strips; which were ~$7.4. These were served with lots of avocado (yay!) on (tortilla) chips. The quantity was a bit less for us, though. For dessert, we ordered a Tennessee Whiskey Cake with pecans and vanilla ice cream which was awesome! The cake was fluffy and with the ice cream, was moistu enough and yummy. This was ~$8 They had a nice, cozy atmosphere with good, tinted glass to protect from the sun. We got a corner booth / island which we like.

I will instead rate the overall service and atmosphere which is always very good. Team members are always eager to help out.

Once we got our food I thought he would bring us silverware. Didn't happen, we had to ask another server to grab us some and when we did he rolled his eyes as he walked away.  Towards the end of our meal to couples sat down next to us, all experienced the same issues with one of them having the same server as was did. They just don't care, I understand they are young and this isn't their ""career"" job but you get paid off of commission. At least do the job correctly and ACT like you want to be there. Check in with your customers to see if everything is correct/ need anything else.  My burger I ordered was completely wrong, cooked wrong, condiments i requested not to be on, etc... unfortunately I will not be going back here again, it took just one time for me and my wife to make that decision.

We didn't have to wait for a table at all which was nice, but it all went down hill from there. Our waitress was very forgetful, pushy with add ons, and didn't seem to be very aware. We started with ordering some waters, but one of our guests ordered a glass of wine. When our waitress carded her, she told her Happy Birthday, and we were extremely confused because her birthday wasn't for five more months-clearly our waitress did not actually know what her birth date was, but served her anyway. The wine finally came about 15-20 long minutes later, and the glass had lipstick marks ALL over it.  Our wine drinker also ordered some soup that she requested be brought out with everyone else's meals, but it was brought out right away...even before the wine.  We ended up waiting over an hour for our burgers and ribs, to the point where it was obvious our waitress forgot to put in our order. What made this even worse was that she disappeared for a while, so we couldn't even ask her to check on the order. When she finally brought out the food, there was no apology.
