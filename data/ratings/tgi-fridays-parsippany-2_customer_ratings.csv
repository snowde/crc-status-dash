23,Steve S.,"Parsippany, NJ",562,1174,285.0,2.0,2013-04-05,"My kids love TGIFridays, but I just don't think it's as good as I used to (though it a far better than Applebees)...that said, I don't mind stopping in to keep the kids happy.  One of my good friends used to manage this location and when he did this place was one of the best in the area.  Service was great and the food was always consistent.  I can't say that anymore-especially after the other night.  The other problem is that Friday's changed their menu and took things off that both kids loved...it happens, but it was frustrating.  We went here the other night for a little celebration for my daughter and in a half filled restaurant the host wanted to seat us at the table next to the door (it was about 35 degrees)...so we asked for something back where it was warmer.  When our waiter finally found us he took our drink order (one beer, one iced tea, and two Sprites) and our appetizer order (soft pretzels)...then disappeared.  Ten minutes later our drinks made their way to us...but no appetizer.  After another five minutes our waiter took our order...still no appetizer (at least it was free because of a coupon).  Stopped watching the clock and the appetizer came...a good solid 2 minutes before our meals.   I don't understand why a place bothers asking how you want a burger when they all come out well done anyway?  Three burgers ordered medium-all overdone.  All three orders included fries, but the plates arrived with three different amounts on our plates - obvious differences, I wouldn't care if it was a couple fries.   My Jack Daniels burger, which comes with bacon had two tiny, crispy (burnt) half-pieces of bacon.  It was so ridiculous that the waiter came back with an entire plate of bacon.  At least my daughter's fried shrimp was ok...just ok (the shrimp they use are quite small, but they tasted fine).  And, to be fair, the burgers were fine-I like the Jack Daniels Burger. This place was such a disappointment and such a change from when our friend managed it that I don't know if I'll be back anytime soon.  It seems like TGIF is looking for ways to cut costs on their meals and in doing so they probably lost a customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-parsippany-2?start=60,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056

I figured I'd order my to go dessert since he was around. When it was finally brought out by a runner it wasn't to go. She was quick to  bring it back to go but still no check and no waiter. I finally asked the host to find him or get my check after waiting 20 minutes with purse on my shoulder credit card on the table with keys and the to go bag in my hand.

79,Rob W.,"Boston, MA",23,87,74.0,3.0,2014-11-24,"Been here several times and we have never had any complaints. The place is always clean, the staff is always courteous and the food is always good.  Yesterday, however, we were a little disappointed by our service. We've come to appreciate, at this particular location, that our servers know how to take social cues. Meaning, they take our order, deliver our order, check on us after it's delivered and basically leave us alone until it's time to get the check. It's always made for a comfortable dining experience for two people who like eating their lunch and having a conversation without being interrupted every 5 minutes.  So yesterday, our server greeted us and first asked if we wanted drinks, immediately suggesting alcoholic beverages, which, at 10 minutes to noon, wasn't what we had in mind. We both declined and said we'd both like sodas. We were asked ""are you sure?"" I found that to be extremely rude but we let it slide. Then she went into the whole specials explanation and went on and on about the new sauces and combos and on and on. I know ""corporate"" makes the servers push the promos, but if it takes more than 15 seconds to explain them, there's a problem. We just sat there awkwardly listening.  When our food arrived, it was delivered by two friendly gentlemen and our food was absolutely fine. No problems there. Our problem was the fact that we were interrupted by our waitress 4 times while we were eating. It's very annoying being asked how everything is again and again. Once is fine and we will get your attention if we need something otherwise.  When she came back at the end and asked if we wanted dessert, we declined and said we'd just like the check, again, we were asked ""are you sure?"" Again, this is rude. Yes, we were sure. We didn't want dessert!!  Finally, when she brought us take out boxes for us to pack up our left overs, she was hovering over our table as we were packing up our boxes as she was opening up the plastic bags for us and taking the containers from us and putting them into bags. I mean really? It's a bit much. Overkill comes to mind and was apparent that she was being overly intrusive and eager in hopes to increase the gratuity. Here's a tip.... Less is more. Don't intrude on your customers to the point of annoyance. The gratuity will be much higher, I guarantee it.  Finally, a suggestion to the hostess and management. The booth located at the far end of the higher left level? Maybe that should be used only after the rest of the tables are utilized. You see, it's very uncomfortable, especially when it's quiet in the restaurant, for a customer to be seated directly behind the server station as servers are typing in orders into the micros computer. As if our conversation wasn't interrupted enough by our server, then we had that uncomfortable feeling that our discussion was being overheard by the servers standing in front of their computer every few minutes. Very poor placement. I have no idea why it's laid out like that.  As I said, the food has always been great....much better than other Fridays locations, but service goes a long way in my book, not just quality food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-parsippany-2?start=40,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005

After I was sent to a table the drinks never came and the server told us we have to show ids again and place the drink order again.

78,Gina I.,"Bloomfield, NJ",0,4,,1.0,2015-03-01,"I'm only giving one star because I have to. I went here on Saturday night with my friend and my fiancé. We were told the wait would be 15-20 minutes but there was at least 7 tables empty and only 5 parties waiting (all were under 4 people). There was two boys manning the hostess podium, nethier one knew how to do their job. So once we got seated, our waitress came over and she was a mess! She took our drink orders after coming back twice and apologizing for allowing her to pay-out another check. Once she took our drink order, she had to read it back to us twice and came back with one water, when we all asked for one. She came back with our drinks a few 10 minutes later and didn't know which beer was what and we had to taste test to be sure we had the right beers. She then took our meal orders and managed to not ""hear"" one of the orders. She brought back two out of three meals and never came back to check up on us for 30 minutes! but she kept walking back and forth and never said anything until we were practically finished with out food to acknowledge she forgot to include the third meal. She told her manager and the manager, who also looked a mess, offered us free dessert or to put in his meal with priority. We didn't take either offer.

On a Tuesday night, there were people waiting in the corridor or foyer whatever you want to call it. I figured it was packed for some reason.

In the dining area to the left of the door was about 4 tables full of people, to the right 2 tables of people and the bar area was pretty full. We stand at the podium for about 5 minutes before my fiance went up to the woman who appeared to be the manager and the host and said, ""Excuse me, two please""...If he hadn't said that we'd still be sitting there today. ""Oh of course sir, what's your name""....yea now you wanna greet us....10 minutes later we were seated. They must've been understaffed or something because probably 60% of the restaurant was completely empty. But wouldn't they put everyone in the same section so that they could use the waiters they did have all in that one area? Whatever. The waitress was fine and the food was typical TGI Fridays food....good enough. But the whole waiting when half the restaurant was free and the rude host and manager just ruined it for me.

Because their upselling is too damned aggressive. Case in point: as a solo business traveler, I was led to my table by a guy who reminded me that ""endless apps are back."" I told him that as a solo traveller- struggling with weight - I didn't need endless apps. Then the server showed up and said, ""I see you've heard about our endless apps"" as if in surprise. I told him I didn't want any apps, then ordered a burger. He came back five minutes later to advise me of some apps deal. For the third time in five minutes I had to advise these people I didn't want the apps. So clearly, management has made a big effort to push these apps to the exclusion of all else (including upsetting the customer). I am no fan of the hard sell so much as I like the food, I won't be back any time soon. So Friday's, you eat the f@#ing apps.

Since they choose not to put their beer prices on the menu (the wine prices are???), the waiter had to find out the price of the beer we were interested in.  That took about 10 minutes.  One of us is on a gluten /dairy free diet so they ordered tomato soup and a salad; no cheese, no croutons.  Well the salad came out fully loaded.  So we sent it back.  This time it came back with no cheese, no croutons and NO tomatoes.  Speaking of Tomatoes, the tomato soup NEVER came...  I ordered the ""your call burger"". Pretty simple right?  Medium rare, swiss cheese, ""roasted"" mushrooms and sautéed Jalapenos.  I guess I should have requested a ""Fresh"" bun as well because the one I got was pretty stale; so much so that the burger almost shot out the back when I bit into it.  The jalapenos were raw and the burger was about 2 stages short of a hockey puck.  When the waiter asked ""how is everything?"", I told him that the burger bun is stale, the jalapenos were raw and we're still waiting on the tomato soup.  He apologized and left.  Then the manager came over to investigate.  He tried to explain that jalapenos come in whole and they didn't think I wanted whole roasted jalapenos.  I pointed the raw, sliced jalapenos in the ramekin on my plate and asked why they couldn't just grill those a bit.  He just looked at me and said ""oh"".  He apologized for the stale bun and said they will take the burger off the bill.  When we said we never got the soup he said that he would take that off the bill as well.  Gee, Thanks!  So overall, not a good dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-parsippany-2?start=60,2.28,2.28,2.28,1.5720000000000003,2.28

After I left the company, this location was the meet up spot with a friend that lives in CT (her parents live in Boonton, NJ). We always had great service in the bar area. Tonight, however, it was absolutely TERRIBLE.  When we arrived, we sat at a usual high top in the bar area. There was about 15 people at the bar and three high top tables: My friend and I at one, a group of 6 next to us and a group of 4 next to them. When we first sat down, our drink order was taken by a young guy with dark boy band hair. After he gave us our drinks, we told him we needed a few more minutes to decide on food. Thirty minutes went by and no one came to take our food order. The table of 6 who were seated after us got their apps before we even ordered. The guy who initially helped us disappeared to take his break it seems. I approached the bar and told one of the young female bartenders that we have been waiting 30 minutes to order and her reply was ""Sorry but we have a lot of people at the bar"" So either they can't handle their job on a Friday night or Fridays needs to add more experienced help. 10 more minutes went by and another skinny young blond girl took our order. Another 25 minutes went by before our sampler appetizer plate arrived. Upon finishing that, we were so disgusted we got the check.  They were understaffed and the individuals behind the bar during the time we were there between 5pm-6:40pm could not handle it at all. Nice girls but just terrible terrible service.

67,S R.,"Morristown, NJ",0,4,,1.0,2016-07-18,"We have gone to TFI Fridays for years as our children enjoy the food and atmosphere.  We usually frequent the one in Hanover.  Knowing it's a chain restaurant, not fine dining, we understand what that entails.  However, we went to the Parsippany one on Saturday night at 7pm.  It was not crowded, and that should have been our first warning.  Our waiter was polite but not trained at all and didn't seem to really care.  We only saw him when we looked for him. He was not busy with other tables.   He took our drink orders:  soda, water and a beer-it took 10 minutes to get them despite sitting literally next to the bar.  The sodas came out a few minutes before the beer.  The bar was not busy either.  We ordered simple meals-no appetizers, no special requests.  Our waiter never returned for drink refills or to check on us.  After 30 minutes we found him and he said our food would be right out.  When my simple cheeseburger was placed down, I could tell it had been cooked and then left to warm for a long time.  It was cold to the touch and the cheese had burned and crackled on the top.  I couldn't even cut it with a steak knife it was so overdone (not that the waiter had asked what temperature I wanted the burger).  The fries on the plate were not seasoned with anything. The side house salad I ordered had nothing but lettuce and two chopped pieces of cucumber-no cheese, croutons or breadstick as the menu reads.  When the waiter came back to ask how everything was I very politely said that my burger was overdone.  As he was turning away from the table his reply was ""sorry to hear that"".  A few minutes later we found the manager, Jasmine.  She took my burger away and offered me something else.  After almost an hour of no food and no confidence that I would get a decent meal, I was done and just asked her to take it off of the bill and she did.  My husband was eating his caesar salad and pulled what looked like a cluster of leaves on a huge stalk from the plate-something that should not be in a salad.  Honestly, it looked like a weed from the backyard.  Again, flagging down our waiter, we gave him no option but asked him to take it off of the check.  My husband ordered a second beer (and he is someone who if the waiter had been attentive would have probably had 4 beers) and it was undrinkable as it was in a pint glass that was not clean.  We gave up and got our check.  My husband and I walked out separately and each of us politely said thank you and goodbye to the two hosts at the front.  They didn't acknowledge either of us.  I will never return to the Parsippany TGIFridays and I think I'm pretty well disgusted with the chain in general now.  Very disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-parsippany-2?start=80,2.28,2.28,2.28,1.6680000000000001,2.28

81,J. P.,"Parsippany, NJ",0,13,4.0,1.0,2016-08-27,"I don't know why the management of this restaurant just doesn't seem to be able ""to get it!"" If you glance through the reviews that are critical, you'll see that a rather common theme is ""poor service.""  I used to frequent the place quite often but, beginning about four years ago, I detected a sharp drop off. First it was just with the service but it eventually became an issue with the quality of the food as well. I complained. Apologies were given, and I returned. But less and less often. In the past year and a half or so, we've been dining there more often because it seemed like they'd taken on some cooks who knew how to properly prepare the food, and service got noticeably better. Until tonight, that is. For starters, the place was far from busy when we arrived. I didn't do a nose count, but I'm sure the manager's check of the register will show that my assessment is correct. We ordered two drinks, and told the server we would give her our order by the time the drinks were delivered.. When she didn't return in ten minutes or so, we hailed a passing server and asked him what had happened to her. He said that he'd let her know we were ready to order. When she arrived some three (or more) minutes later, neither one of the drinks were what had been ordered. I could live with mine, so I accepted it, but my guest wanted her drink on the rocks (and not mixed), so it had to be returned. About five minutes later, the server returned with the drink. Without the lemon that had specifically been requested that is. When we asked her questions about some of the items we were interested in, her response generally was, ""I don't know, I'll have to check."" We eventually decided on two of the items on the menu and placed our orders. Once again she left, and once again we were left waiting. We saw guests who arrived after us (and had different servers) getting their meals while we just sat and waited. And waited some more. So once again, after sitting there for an additional ten minutes or so,  we had to hail a passing server and ask him if our server had perhaps gone home because she wasn't feeling well. He again said that he'd have her see to it that our meals were delivered. When she arrived about ten minutes later, she told us that she had delivered the dishes we'd ordered to another table! I find it hard to believe that two people at another table had ordered exactly the same thing we had. I suspect that they, too, had been sitting there for close to a half hour as well, and were prepared to take anything that was put on the table. When the manager arrived, we were old the same old story that  the server had given us. Not an apology, mind you, but some mumbling about the fact that some of the staff hadn't shown up. Not that the number of guests called for more staff, mind you, but apparently any excuse is better than none at all, right? We cancelled the food order. The manager offered some sort of a discount coupon that  could be used at the time of our next visit. My advice to the manger is this: first, hire some competent people. Then properly train and supervise them. Finally, don't hold your breath, thinking that we're about to come rushing back soon! There are a lot of restaurants out there, and the goal of going out for dinner is not to come home with an empty stomach and a pounding headache! .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-parsippany-2?start=40,2.12,2.12,2.12,1.8920000000000003,2.12

57,Marvic P.,"Clifton, NJ",3,24,,2.0,2017-03-05,"On March 4th, 2017, I was looking into eating out and eating a good steak. Based on my research, I happened to find TGI Fridays, so I asked my father how was his overall dining experience there and it was not good at all. Even though he recommended me not to go there, I went against his own recommendation and boy should I have taken his advice! Since I went to the one in Clifton, I had a so-so experience, I've decided to give the TGI franchise a second chance, so I drove all the way to Parsippany. As I am arriving to this TGI Fridays, I realize how unique it is to have it on a more elevated area in Route 46 West, and it stood out much more than other TGI Fridays that I have seen. To start things off, the location, atmosphere, steak and fries were great! On the other hand, those were the only positive outcomes of this experience that I've had. Like any other restaurant, our waitress started us off with some drinks. Me and a friend of mine ordered the strawberry lemonade, and it was okay (not great or awful). Wait time to get lemonade? Approximately 30 minutes. Next, when I finished the icy lemonade, I asked if I can have a refill and it would take an additional 10 minutes for it to arrive by another person that is not even our waitress. Oh, and it was pretty empty for a Saturday night. At this point, my patience began to dim. The saliva flow was building up profusely, and it would be another 15 minutes, until we received our appetizers (mozzarella sticks and boneless BBQ wings). The boneless wings came out to be spicy the first time, not BBQ. After the mistake, the waitress brought BBQ wings and it lacked my expectations. It tasted as if it were still uncooked. Whereas, the mozzarella sticks tasted as if they put a piece of cheese in between two loafs of bread, melted cheese on top, rolled it up, and called it ""mozzarella sticks"". The steak has yet to arrive and it has been over 70 minutes. By this time, we already ate three rounds of each appetizer, primarily due to hunger, and she was offering another round, but I wanted the NY strip that I was craving. After approximately 110 minutes (1 hour and 50 minutes) the waitress passes by again to ask how are we doing. I asked her about how much longer is it going to take for our steaks to arrive. As she saw the discontented looks that both of us had, she went to check and in less than 3 minutes, it finally arrived. When I saw how she immediately went to attain our steaks after our faces of discontent, and deliver it to us, this really disappointed me. Mind I tell all the fellow Yelpers and people who are reading this review, I have asked a couple of times before how long until we get our steaks and she said that it would be coming out soon. The steaks and fries were the last positive outcomes of this dining experience. The Jack Daniels sauce that they added was delicious and the fries were good. Later on, we skipped the deserts, because our tanks were finally full. Finally, yet importantly, the bill for the dining experience. $79.20 for the horrible dining experience that we'd have to endure, without even including the tip on the bill. This is the second and last time that I am going to a TGI Fridays facility. I do not even blame the waitress. Moreover, the administration deserves most of the blame. There is absolutely no excuse for the lack of customer service, and it is highly intolerable for a restaurant to provide two customers two steaks almost two hours after they ordered it with only a little more than half of the restaurant being full on a Saturday night. I will be taking my business somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-parsippany-2?start=20,1.76,1.76,1.76,1.9920000000000002,1.7600000000000002

8,Bill B.,"Denville, NJ",0,18,1.0,1.0,2017-04-01,Have been coming here fairly regularly for years for good apps and good service at the bar. Have to say though that in the last few months the service at the bar has dropped off dramatically. The bartenders are still very polite and have a smile on their face but the level of attentiveness is well below the norm. Some nights it appears to be because they are too busy with service and the hightops. Other nights it appears that there is too much sidework going on.  Either way it adds up to a subpar experience.  Kudos to the kitchen though for keeping the food consistent.  A year later and service at the bar is still terrible. Bar staff is unable or unwilling to ever look up while performing tasks.  Someone needs to let them know that you can pour a draft beer and take a quick glance at your customers at the same time. There were 3 bartenders behind the bar and there was never more than a dozen customers at the bar and two or three hightops yet we all waited for drinks and food orders. The barmaid that took our second drink order had to ask us what our first round was because it was never put in the system. Bad sign.  Another barmaid yelled over to one of the hightops to get their drink order and then placed the drinks on the bar for them to pickup. Another bad sign considering they were just not that busy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-parsippany-2,1.68,1.68,1.68,1.8280000000000003,1.6800000000000002
