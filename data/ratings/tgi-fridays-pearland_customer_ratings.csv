49,Meryl O.,"Houston, TX",80,75,1.0,4.0,2012-03-01,"Note: This is a review for the bar and bartenders. Also, keep in mind this is Pearland, and there are limited choices as far as bars or restaurants open past 10 pm go.  I go here relatively often because it is close to where I live and because of the few comparable choices in Pearland. If smoke bothers you, I would avoid this place because patrons can smoke in the bar. They have a pretty good happy hour (I think it is half off of select appetizers), and later at night, the burgers are discounted. Considering it is a large chain restaurant, the potstickers and the wings are good (the inferno wings are pretty spicy). If you are leaning towards a lighter option, the flatbread is also good (they also have more ""skinny"" drink options than most places).  The main reason I like this place is due to the bartenders. They are very friendly and take time to entertain and talk to the customers (also, they tend to pour a good drink). Also, they remember people's names and faces when you come back. On different nights of the week they also have poker and a d.j.  While this isn't a high end martini bar, it's a good place to hang out and have a drink with friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pearland?start=40,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997

I thought TGIF was supposed to have good potato skins, but they were pretty bad. Dry potatoes, way too salty, and no green onions (garnishing the sour cream bowl with a few green onion slices doesn't count). The child's mac & cheese made my kid sick that night.

I'm giving it 5 stars because I came here on Veteran's day and they treated us really well.  Both my girlfriend and I are veterans and we had the list of all the offers that restaurants were holding for the weekend. TGI Friday did not have anything spectacular. It was like a free appetizer or something at a certain time , but we came here anyway for dinner. We ordered a couple of steak dishes, a couple of beers and an appetizer. Only after we ordered did we ask if there was any veteran day deals. Our waitress didn't know so she went to ask the manager. We expected none, but she came back and asked to see our VA IDs. After we showed it to her, she said the manager wanted to comp our entire meal and thank us for our service. The manager never came over to thank us personally, but the gesture was pretty awesome. We enjoyed our meal, left a $20 tip and it made our night.

62,Courtney A.,"Jacksonville, FL",17,56,70.0,1.0,2013-06-11,"So I came here the other day and ordered a turkey burger. After three or four bites, the texture just seemed off, as was the color. So I cut it in half, which normally I do to begin with, but I was starving, so I dug in. anyway, the thing is bleeding in the middle. Which, fine if it's beef, but so not fine if it's turkey! So when the waiter comes back, I ask him if it's turkey or beef, he says it should be turkey, so then I show him how it's not fully cooked. He takes it, and a few minutes later brings it back, during, yes the kitchen said its turkey. He says ""do you want another one?"" By this time the kids are ready to go, and quite frankly I'm grossed out!! I politely decline, and he, instead of offering me something else, he just says ""fine, I'll get your bill"". Ok whatever. So come 10 pm that night, I'm laying in bed, and start having horrible stomach cramps. They continue all night, and all day the next day, for over 24 hours. I felt like I was going to vomit, but never did, & I think it's cause I only took a few bites, thankfully, or I would have really been sick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pearland?start=60,2.468,2.468,2.468,2.468,2.468

It isn't just this location, but all the TGI FRIDAYS in general.   The food is hit and miss. I took it back to my childhood tonight and ordered chicken fingers. My daughter ordered the chicken fingers, but from the children's menu.  The only difference in the two was the price and the plates they were served on.  There were barely any fries on the adult sized dish. There were more on the children's size basket.  My wife kind of mentioned it to the waiter, not to get more, but just to point out that maybe they should charge for 2 kids meals. The waiter basically just shrugged it off. My son ordered a burger medium, and it was almost well done.  My wife's sizzling chicken and shrimp skillet was definitely sizzling, but the dish was very bland. The mashed potatoes were watery.  Aside from the food, the service was subpar also.  The waiter was friendly, but didn't seem to pay attention to our orders. One of the drinks we ordered from the bar came only after we reminded the waiter about 15 minutes after ordering it.

So who knew TGI would provide me with an enjoyable food experience? The last time I was here the twins were 9 and I swore Never to return.... But as I drove around looking for a ""quick fix"" I.e. No Tex Mex, Vietnamese or BBQ (no full bar) or Italian, I opted against all my normal stops (since it is raining with tornado weather conditions) to give TGI a go.  Well I went in with no expectations, but was quickly enticed by the Ahi Tuna on a tortilla, topped with guacamole, sirrachi and wasabi ranch drizzle(it was Devine). The pretzels in its beer batter cheese Sauce complimented the strawberry Moscow mule perfectly....  Well if you go against your usual bar food menu option and explore a foodie maybe able to find solace and pleasure in the 'burbs at a local franchise...: (maybe), or was I just too excited for a stolen moment away from Mommy Reality?

I ate the cheese sticks and waited for him to come back and he didn't, so I had to chase him down to pay the bill.  Instead of discounting the portion of pasta, he said I had to pay it all whether or not I ate it. $13.00 dollars for four cheese sticks and a tea. .

The bartender never acknowledged us again after he gave me the menu.
