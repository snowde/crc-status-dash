The table wasn't all the way clean when we sat down - there was trash behind the condiment/drink menu set up. And it wasn't like it was super packed and whoever bussed the table was just rushing, it was more like he just didn't pay attention.  Food was typical Friday's. One friend and I both ordered steaks medium. I ordered it medium expecting it to come out medium rare (outback does that too - strange), but apparently friend actually wanted it medium. She sent it back, and it came back complete with the piece she had cut off, but cooked better. The side of broccoli was two giant stalks of broccoli, and the ginger lime slaw was good, but needed some more seasoning. Salt helped. Other friend loved her salad. All in all, about what I expected from a Friday's.

This is the first time we ordered from this location, we tend to make the drive up to kop but I wanted to give this place a shot.  We called ahead, both entres from the jack Daniels grill; flat iron steak and the sirloin with shrimp, medium and medium raw both mash potatoes. When we arrived back to the house, both steaks were well done and I couldn't eat mine because it tasted burnt. They also forgot the shrimp. They charged us, but it wasn't packaged for us. We were both tired from driving 2 hours so I wasn't in the mood to drive back just for shrimp. I just ate the mash potatoes drenched in the sauce. I thought I could eat anything wih that sauce, boy was I wrong. A burnt steak still tasted like a burnt steak.

I've been waiting tables for 5 years now and I have never worked anywhere where the managers would allow that from any employee- on the clock or not.  It REALLY takes away from any kind of positive experience you could even hope to get from that place.    On the other hand, Avia (not sure on the spelling??) is super sweet!  she took over for our server once we settled our bill and continued ordering.. my fiance ate there for lunch earlier in the week and she was his server, so once he saw her he made mention of being in there before and how well she did her job, so i'm sure that had something to do with her taking us on, but none-the-less, we appreciated her willingness and attention, and for that, we way over tipped her, but she deserved it more than he did.  so next time we go, we'll be asking to sit in her section for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3?start=100,1.72,1.72,1.72,1.9920000000000002,1.7200000000000002

The menu has expanded substantially to include city local favorites like the bread pretzels and choice of mini bites which will fill your appetite. The signature dishes are still a demand such as the glazed salmon the grilled very well seasoned chicken and the burgers. The drink menu especially the wine selection has top choices.  I would recommend a Riesling with any of there fish dishes as it has a bold buttery taste to compliment.

No problem, many people might be coming out for Sunday Brunch. After being seated and given our menus, we noticed that there were several empty tables in the restaurant. So why the wait? We decide to look through our menus, and as I am making suggestions about starters/appetizers, I'm getting strange looks from my parents. Apparently they were missing pages from their menu. By this time, no server has come to our table to introduce themselves or take drink orders. My father returns to the hostess desk up front and request two new menu (without missing pages) and he is given two new menu. After looking through these menu, they notice there are still missing pages! (Shouldn't someone be checking these menus).

It's easily family friendly and the place I enjoy sharing crispy green bean fries with my nieces and nephew. It's also a chain restaurant so there's a level of cheap fun that I can get in the mood for every now and then.  So, I had a particular taste for the green beans (minus the family) and upon arrival; we waited about 25 minutes to be seated with the view of more/less 20 empty and prepped tables in sight. There was a lobby full of people waiting... And a ton of empty chairs. Servers were observed to be huddled in the bathroom touching up their outfits, others grooming their beards in the back mirror, and then a few were just... standing there.  Once seated; we were approached by 3 different servers who couldn't figure out if they were serving our table or not. At one point, a server introduced herself as our waiter and just after she asked for our order, she then walked off to tend to her phone just a few steps behind us. Then server #2 came back around and also asked us for our order and when I informed her of server #1, she plopped down and stretched herself over our table - probably also groaning at the same ratchet-behind behavior we were experiencing. Then she walks off and a couple minutes later server #3 steps on the scene in attempt to pick up the pieces.  These dang green beans fries.  What the eff. Luckily, Friday's food should be the same, and it was so I can't really say much about that but if you saw how chaotic this place was; you'd probably question everything.  Moreover, just as we're getting ready to pay - Drake's ""Hotline Bling"" gets blasted over the sound system and to our right are two women droppin', woppin', and twerking as Drake reminisces on the girl who used to call him his cell phone.  Again, I didn't expect this to be some magical luxe place; I used a lot of my hard earned work study money there while I was in college but dang. This particular Friday's has grown to be especially terrible. Did I mention I was awarded the ""Maverick"" Yelp Badge for checking in at this place? This badge is awarded because I was living life on the edge with no fear of ""danger"" - That's how bad; it's a risky move to come here, Yelp will even pat you on the back.

Walked in & waited at the hostess station to be seated or greeted. No one there for 10 mins. Flagged down a few people who seemed to be lost & still in training mode. Surveying the restaurant I see there are a handful of tables occupied. Plenty were empty.  Finally we were seated at a table. Sat there for 10-15 mins until a waitress came. I'm already frustrated from earlier, so this just raised my frustration up another notch, although I TRY my hardest to understand & be patient. People who were seated right next to us were seated AFTER us & received their apps and entrees BEFORE us. WHY? Because our waitress spent 15-20 mins at a table with older woman explaining about their split checks all the while dancing & singing with no urgency in the world.  Our entrees came out WITH the app (which was cold) & 10 mins later the kids meal which was ordered before the rest. At this point I'm just ready to leave. We explained that what happened was not ok & the waitress assured us she'll talk to the manager & possibly comp something. Check came & no comp on total bill. Pointed this out & she said ""Ugh flagging down this manager is so hard!"" Ummmm......that's not my problem! They took it off & she had the audacity to say our total bill keeps going down (the free entree & now the comp) AVOID!

I once told the manager to reseat me because one side of the place smelled like mildew. I told him the rag I saw the dish collector using was where the smell was coming from. He moved me and the dish collector continued to wipe down the restaurant down with a dirty cloth. I still smelled it after moving.The restrooms are so nasty I will leave as soon as I have to go because Id rather stop eating and leave and go there. They are NEVER clean.

There typically is a 20"" or longer wait for a table, yet there are many tables actually open. Instead of using the open tables, they just make people wait. The wait staff is not motivated and it takes a long time to be served. We waited 30"" for a table and it took another 15"" to get a waitress at the table. A manager actually came to our table to ask how everything was not even noticing we had no drinks or anything at the table. When I let him know we were waiting for a waitress, he took our drink order and apologized but that's where his intervention ended. It's took another 15 minutes to get our drinks from our waitress but it wasn't the correct drink order. She took it back and took another 10"" to bring the right drinks! Basically, we waited 40 minutes for a server.  I will say that the food was very good and cooked appropriately but there was no additional service. No napkins, no refills, no visit from the server at all. We did notice the server spending some time with some gentleman at another table flirting away for a good 15 minutes so maybe that's what she was spending her time doing instead of waiting on tables. There are a lot of people who sit at the bar and it is a little loud but this could be a great place if it was better managed and the waitstaff were interested in actually serving the customers who were dining.

What a nightmare I ran out and won't be back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3,1.8,2.0,2.0,,1.92
14,Jake F.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,56,11.0,3.0,2017-07-08,So if you're drunk and want to get down this place is LIT.   Literally Club Fridays on Fridays and Saturdays.    Loud as heck too.   Place gets really really packed.   But sometimes I just want to chill and eat and have my food fast.    If you're young or feeling like partying this place is 5 stars except for the wait time.   If you're older or have a headache you'll think this place is too loud.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3,1.88,2.02,2.02,,1.964
53,Dawn S.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,6,,1.0,2017-08-02,"I and my daughter stopped in tonight to grab a quick bite. unfortunately, no server ever came to our table.we waited 15-20 minutes. granted it was busy, but no one introduced themselves to us, or even acknowledged our presence. after becoming frustrated from hunger, I took my child and left. my understanding only comes from having worked for the company in the past, at a different location. but, given that experience and training, I know that the lack of professional etiquette was totally unacceptable. I am seriously considering never eating there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3?start=20,1.72,2.02,2.02,,1.9

12,Karissa D.,"Meriden, CT",4,6,3.0,1.0,2017-09-02,"Terrible service. We were in here for an unneeded 2 hrs. It took about 40 mins just to get our drinks n which then the waitress said they ran out of one the beverages that were requested. I asked for my burger on the green (no bun), add spicy mustard n white cheese; the meal was brought out on the bun, yellow cheese no mayo. I should of been asked if I wanted yellow cheese if there was no white before it being brought out to me. Then they also came out saying they ran out of spicy mayo. My turkey burger was bland and I ended up sending it back. Would never come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3,1.72,2.01,2.01,,1.894

46,Christine S.,"Abington, MA",0,4,,1.0,2017-09-17,"I came to TGI Friday's with low expectations, and let me tell you, those low expectations were not even met. I walked in with a group of 12 on a Saturday afternoon when the restaurant was empty. The hostess took 15 minutes to sit while there was an abundance of vacant seats. Once we were seated in the back room, we waited another 15 minutes and never even saw a waitress. We walked out and NO ONE even noticed we left. The service is abominable and I would not recommend this place for even one drink. Good luck folks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3?start=20,1.56,1.98,1.98,,1.8120000000000003

2,Tommi A.,"Philadelphia, PA",103,110,106.0,1.0,2017-10-03,"I understand TGI Fridays on a Friday are notorious; however, when you have great management issues can be minimized and/or at least be unbenounced to patrons.  Sitting at the bar this past Friday with my cousin we turned around to a disturbance behind us. One of the people sitting at the high top bar behind us had thrown up right behind us. We couldn't even get up to move it was right there. The one who was assigned to clean it was kind enough to say to us that he would have a manager come talk to us and see if they could do anything about the bill. No manager came by and when the bar tender brought us the check and i mentioned this she was very rude. ""A bar back told you he could do something about your bill??"" She was very demeaning and inconsiderate considering how a man just threw up on our heels. It shouldn't have been a question to take care of us.

8,Mark M.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,3,,1.0,2017-12-04,"I'm actually in this Friday's right now  I ordered the Jack Daniels chicken sandwich and the chicken was thick but tough. Chicken breast should not be tough yaw! So you know I sent it back. Then I just decided something quick - And I ordered the loaded nachos with chicken and all this melted cheese/black beans. About 3-4 pieces of chicken could they spare another piece o God! The manager order this me because the server sent him over. My son enjoyed his food,but as usual I'm leaving Friday's disappointed! No  time soon will I becoming here. Another waste of cash . Last time I was here I was food disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3,1.48,1.97,1.97,,1.774

1,Ian D.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,29,,1.0,2017-12-26,"My in-laws like Friday's and the likes, so we agreed to eat here. I usually have no problem at all, as the food is reliable and consistent across the board. At least that is what I thought. This place was the worst from start to finish.  Terrible service. Servers arguing with each other and with other staff. The food took a very long time to arrive, and when it did it lacked flavor and appeared to be thrown together.  It was greasy and not appetizing. Our server never came and checked up on during our meal, nor did I ever see a manager. What should have been a 45 minute experience took us 2 hours.  Ouch. Not a rewarding experience, and we will definitely not be returning to this establishment or other Friday's in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3,1.48,1.91,1.91,,1.738
