122,T L.,"Washington, DC",0,43,17.0,2.0,2012-02-22,"Visited this location due to staying at a nearby hotel.  The wait was about 30 minutes and we were seated upstairs.  After about 15 minutes, James, came up and took our orders.  Restrooms were filthy like a truck stop or abandoned rest area. The food was mediocre and the service was lackluster at best.  As soon as our food came out, we asked for our check and boxes.  I couldn't stand being in that place much longer.  Do yourself a favor and go to Wawa for a sub and not waste your money on this place.   HQ if you are reading, do the public a favor and hire people who want to work at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia?start=80,2.24,2.24,2.24,1.832,2.24

They weren't packed, but they obviously had at least 5 or 6 wait staff/greeters with nothing better than to stand on the door and gossip and block people from coming in and out.

We were seated by a girl in over-the-knee socks and a miniskirt. That is the last time anyone paid us any mind. And that part is funny too. After we waited and waited, no one came to greet us at our table or take drink orders. We realized we'd rather spend our time and money enjoying ourselves and our food! So we left.

71,Kristi B.,"West Fargo, ND",16,34,,1.0,2012-06-15,"I've been to Friday's restaurants in various locations and this is one place I wish I had skipped.  We went here solely on the recommendation at our hotel just down the road.  We should have gone to Subway across the street. They were not terribly busy, but the long wait to get in on a Wednesday night was due to the fact they just don't pay attention to the patrons.   We were told our wait would be 20 minutes but it was well over 30 minutes.  We waited, like everybody else has mentioned, longer than necessary to get our water we requested.  It was another interminable wait for our waitress to come back to take our order.  Of the four orders, two were correct.  We ate it anyway and I made a mental note to make sure our bill reflected the food we were served and not the food we ordered.   While we were waiting for our food, a patron was leaving the restaurant but was unable to navigate the stairs to get back to street level.  There is a wheelchair lift she planned to use.  One employee locked her in it and left her.  I'm not sure why she left, but that poor woman was left there for 15 minutes.  Not only did I feel sorry for her having to stand for that long when it was clear she was uncomfortable but how humiliating!   Our waitress knew a group of people who came in while we were eating.  If I thought we were ignored before, I am not sure how to describe how ignored we were after her friends came in.  She took my credit card for the bill and walked over to visit with them.  It was 10 minutes of visiting before she left them to run my card.  In that time, I was trying to pool enough cash at the table so I could leave that and walk over to her to ask for my card back.  Sadly, we were short $6. On top of the horrible service and mediocre food, the music was unbearably loud.  We were not seated at the bar, either. Save your time, money and hearing--go somewhere else.  Even Doritos from a convenience store would be preferable to this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia?start=100,1.96,1.96,1.96,1.7320000000000002,1.96

Spinach Florentine Flatbread These were dreadful. Limp, moist, no texture at all. Almost bland. Chicken Fingers These came well fried and were huge and plentiful. The accompanying fries were seasoned with S/P and were decent. Cheeseburger At a joint like this - they won't be asking for the temp of your burger. Expect it cooked well. Still - they create a nice char. Two slices of American cheese. Decent - but nothing to write home about. Fries were OK.  Overall - a filling meal and affordable. But nothing great.

My manager is retiring after 32 years and anytime someone leaves the company we have a happy hour, very original. Usually it's at Tir Na Nog or Con Murphy's and I'm not really a fan of either but when it was announced that it was at Friday's I REALLY wasn't a fan of that idea but oh well, in 60 years when I'm ready to retire I'll be able to choose my own place (hopefully BRU will still be around). We arrived at 4:00 and went up to the rooftop bar. Who knew they had a rooftop bar?! Happy hour specials don't start until 5:00 but the bartender said let's just start it at 4:00, who cares. I like this guy. More and more people from work began filing in but there was plenty of room and the bartenders helped us pull tables together. The reggae playing over the speakers had everyone feeling irie and as time went on I looked around and everyone was having a fantastic time.

I asked the employee who sat customers were there any tables by the window which looks out onto the Parkway. She said, ""No...we only have one."" Thought that was EXTREMELY weird; we only needed one table. THAT should have been the sign for us to leave. She sat us at the one table by the window. Good.  I ordered a cocktail, my guest ordered water. Waitress returns with water for both of us - no cocktail. We sat 30 minutes no food, no cocktail. She did stop by and told me the bartender was working on my drink. Fifteen minutes later she came with drink but glass was dirty. I asked her to cancel the drink. Guest got his food after waiting nearly an hour - I waited a little longer. When she did bring my dish it was the wrong item.  In the many years I've eaten out, I have NEVER experience this type of inadequacy. I can laugh now as I think about the buffoonery of it all. Why didn't we pick up and leave? Our time was limited and we had to eat. I can safely write here, I would never visit this establishment again.

111,luke B.,"Denver, CO",0,20,,1.0,2014-04-30,"Alright... so let me preface this review by the fact that I have given this place multiple attempts, as I often stay at the Embassy Suites above it for business and this place doubles as a hotel restaurant as well as a standalone place. This means it is the only place I had access to without going outside, so I've probably visited here about 5 times.  The food is what it is - it is a chain, the food comes in pre-packaged, its pretty hard to have a variable experience with regards to the food at a TGI Friday's. What earns it the one star is everything else about the experience. As others have mentioned, the service is terrible, particularly at the bar. The bartenders (I think one is the manager) is more concerned with making wildly inappropriate comments to some ""regulars"" than serving anyone else (I'm a young dude, I usually don't get bothered by this stuff, but I've sat there being ignored for 10 minutes due to this banter). The beers are outrageously overpriced... though some happy hour specials are fantastic.  The nail in the coffin is the cleanliness... the last time i visited there, I had a shopping bag on the ground next to me at the bar, and the guy next to me was kind enough to point out that a cockroach was about to crawl in it.

An employee holding two meals came to our table and asked it they were ours - and they weren't even close.  He didn't seem to find the right table anywhere near ours.  Hopefully, he found went before it got cold.  3)  When the waitress who took our order came with our food, my order was correct, but what they brought for my wife was someone else's order, so she had to bring it back and get the correct order,  4)  During the dinner, my wife needed to use the restroom and she asked the host where it was and he directed her to it. It was a single unit unisex restroom and, while my wife was in the restroom, a man walked it.  Apparently, the lock on the door did not work!  When my wife went back and told the host the lock was broken, he responded by telling her that they knew it was broken and were telling people - however he didn't tell my wife when he told her where the restroom was located.  5)  We were in eye sight of 3 other tables and each of the tables seemed to have something go wrong: misdelivery of food or, as to one table, something so wrong with the food that they took it away and, what appeared to be a manager, came, and it appeared that he apologized to the couple.  If we ever get back to that part of Philadelphia, rest assured we will never go back to this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia?start=100,1.6,1.6,1.6,1.252,1.6000000000000003

We should've had an idea of what was to come immediately upon entering the door. We followed 2 other parties in, and the hostess had a terrible time explaining that we couldn't head right upstairs to the roof patio but rather had to wait for each party to be seated individually downstairs. The wait wasn't an issue when it came to getting seated, but it was a very discombobulated situation in terms of understanding what we needed to do (which was wait downstairs and then be retrieved by the hostess per group as she went up and down the stairs).  Once we were seated, no one came to ask us what we wanted to drink. We were parched and in pretty bad need of water. 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes...we finally grabbed a random waitress walking by and asked for service. She went and found us someone inside who said that apparently the other server had left and no one had replaced her at her tables (great).  So, we put in our drink orders and ordered our food at the same time. Another 30 minutes passed. NO DRINKS, NO FOOD OR APPS. We grabbed the other server again as she walked by who seemed appalled that we STILL hadn't gotten our drinks. (Note: the roof patio wasn't even busy - only maybe 2 or 3 other parties were out there.) Over an hour of waiting later, the drinks finally showed up, but we never did get the pitcher of water that we asked for when placing our order. Our alcoholic beverages didn't come until even later. But we had our water - FINALLY - after asking for it numerous times.  Onto the food...our boneless wings were NOT boneless. I personally ate a wing and felt a huge crunch, spitting out a mouthful with a 1 in (maybe bigger) piece of bone. Yuck. There was also a long piece of hair on that plate that I pulled out and tossed onto the ground.    My husband ordered Jack Daniels flat iron steak and got the steak with no Jack Daniels sauce. He sat around waiting for the sauce (which was supposed to be ON the steak to begin with) for about 10 minutes. It was clear our server was frustrated with the kitchen because our food was taking so incredibly long and coming out incorrect.  We did tell her to inform the kitchen of some of these issues, but we didn't get approached by management or have any adjustments to our bill. We didn't ask directly to speak with management but given all of the problems we were dealing with and alerting them of, you would think management would've been informed.

I could understand if the place was mobbed with rowdy customers during a sporting event they were playing and the service was lacking. That was not the case tonight. There were open tables, drinks took forever to get to the table and when they did - they had to be the WORST drinks I ever had. How ironic that this establishment markets ""THEE Friday's Ultimate Margarita"" and it was the worst drink I have ever had made for me outside of my undergrad days drinking mystery drinks during my collegiate rugby years. I chugged beer out of my mate's rugby cleat and this was still worse. I came here because my daughter is a picky eater and it was late, and for some reason she loves Fridays. The waiter did not bring waters for ANY of us. We ordered wings and asked for plates so we could share. Never came. He passed by twice and we politely reminded him - still nothing. It just kept getting worse from that point on and I could drone on forever about how much worse it got but I'll sum it up. Even the server said sorry but had no reason or excuse for his shitty service. Feeling sorry is nice and all but it doesn't excuse you for sucking at your job. On top of that, there were about 4 uniformed people who worked there walking up and down the aisle as if they were checking up on things but didn't do anything. Definitely not short staffed, just lazy. I am in the Army and I know what shamming out looks like. This place wreaked of it. I can't believe I even paid for my sorry excuse for a meal.

She even said we can only use a particular table upstairs, so we said we'd rather sit downstairs. Back downstairs. There was a couple that was leaving their table and we asked her if we could use that one. She said ok but that we'd have to wait 15 minutes for them to ""prepare the table"" (hmm) so we thought ok maybe we can wait.

Our waitress tried to blame everyone else for the delay and even argued with as after asking if we got everything and we informed her that we didn't. When I eventually got my food after an hour and a half of waiting, I asked for blue cheese for my wings. Sharday (our waitress) never returned. Meanwhile there were about five servers sitting at a booth nearby for our entire dinner and no one ever came to check in on us. Sharday was taking over an hour now to get back to the table and it was almost 11pm, we wanted to dine and dash it was so long. I'm sure the other servers heard us talking about it, by this point we were pretty much the only table in the place. No one came over. Eventually, one of us had to go over to the group of servers and ask for our checks. They all started asking ""Yeah where IS Sharday??"" as if they hadn't noticed she'd been gone for over an hour.

5,Des C.,"Barrington, RI",94,268,18.0,1.0,2017-08-05,"What a joke this place is!  Since we were still in a bit of a late lunch cheesesteak coma we decided to have a light dinner at the hotel restaurant.  We arrived and were told that there was a 15 minute wait....even though there were a number of open tables.  They said that those tables were for 21 and over people, and we had our 8 year old twins with us.  Okay, I guess I cannot argue with that, so we waited. 15 minutes or so later they called our name and put us in the booth at the other end of the joint.  We sat there for 15 minutes and no one came to greet us or even take a drink order.  Finally I decided that we would take our business elsewhere but wanted to let a manager know.  When we were walking our we asked to have a manager come.  After 5 minutes of waiting we started walking out when a man appeared from the upstairs.  He asked what the issue was, so I told him that we had waited without even being acknowledged.  He said that he would be happy to discount our order if we stayed.  I told him that I was not interested in that after the experience I had and would be letting corporate know.  He said ""Thank you"" as we walked away. This place should be shut down or switched to another chain.  Don't waste your money or time here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia,1.32,1.6,1.6,,1.4880000000000002
35,Jon L.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,9,,1.0,2017-08-07,Stopped in for dinner before a concert at the cathedral.  Told the server we only had an hour.  Took 10 minutes to get out drinks and then over 30 minutes to get or food.  Told them to take it back.  No apology or anything from the manager.  Won't be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia?start=20,1.32,1.6,1.6,,1.4880000000000002

The bartender made the wrong drink, the waitress brought the wrong salad, and the burger was cooked dry.  It's way to loud and the service was slow.  Go several blocks south - much better options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia,1.32,1.6,1.6,,1.4880000000000002
3,Monique M.,"Bucks County, PA",11,2,,1.0,2017-08-20,"This place used to be one of my favorite restaurants, but not anymore. We came into the restaurant and perhaps because we were sat by the window, a server didn't appear to our table for a half hour and that was after we inquired as to whether or not we even had a server. Once the server came, she was friendly and apologetic, we gave our food and drink orders. It took another half hour to get our drinks (refillable tea, which was never refilled) and another fifteen minutes after that for us to receive our food. Once we did it was hot and tasted pretty good. My son ordered endless appetizers, but had to wait about 20 minutes for each order to be filled. After the second refill, he was annoyed, as were we all and we found someone to give us the bill, paid it and left. Sorry TFI FRIDAYS on the Parkway, we won't be back!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia,1.2,1.6,1.6,,1.4400000000000002
2,Lindsey D.,"Saint Paul, MN",101,12,3.0,1.0,2017-08-21,"We very often have coupons for Fridays and sometimes a free sandwich just seems more appealing than turning on the stove in an 80 degree apartment.  The vibe on a Thursday at 6:15 was weird to say the least. There was a DJ playing LOUD music inside and the two of us were seated at a giant booth nearby.  I got the southwest chicken salad. It was fine, but I think I could've made a better one at home. The service was slow and the music was too loud to carry on a conversation (wow, I really am getting old).  All-in-all, I was thoroughly unimpressed. We had attempted to go to this location once before to sit outside on the roof deck for some drinks and were told the roof deck was closed (at 7 PM on a Saturday) so we went elsewhere.  Take your business to a higher quality, local business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia,1.2,1.59,1.59,,1.4340000000000002
31,Jason J.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,1,,1.0,2017-08-27,"Tried to order take-out, was put on hold for 6 minutes. Hung up and called back thinking they just forgot about me and was subsequently put on hold again. 10 mins later I hang up and call back just to complain and they just put me on hold...again...?!? As I'm holding I go on chilis website and order what I wanted. Then I try to wait for someone to take me off hold at Friday's so I can once again complain but they never take me off hold. So I hung up and call for a 4th time just to tell them the good news that I ordered from chilis!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia?start=20,1.2,1.56,1.56,,1.4160000000000001

My boyfriend got food poisoning from his meal that he could barely finish 1/3 of, THERE WAS A DAMNED COCKROACH ON THE WALL WHERE MY SEAT WAS, you have to scream to have a conversation at your table, and it took twenty minutes for our waiter to deliver an overpriced Miller Lite. This place is disgusting.  I apologize to the person whose boneless wing I touched yet was re-delivered to the correct table, I was a bit tipsy and didn't realize that even happened until writing this review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia,1.2,1.55,1.55,,1.4100000000000001

8,Lauren W.,"Brooklyn, NY",66,46,22.0,3.0,2017-10-14,"I'm staying at the Sheraton down the block and I was hungry so I went there around 10 pm on Friday. The restaurant seemed more like a night club as in you go there to pre game before you go out. It was extremely small, a dj was playing old school music which i loved and the service wasn't all that bad. It had a very free spirit vibe and though I do like that, there were young girls nearly naked there. Problem is, there were young children there as well. If they want to turn it into a club then make it 21 yrs or older after a certain time. I don't even think the girls half dressed were 21. It made me uncomfortable. Food came out pretty quick. Everything tasted good. If you want a peaceful dinner then this isnt the place for you. If you want to turn up, go for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia,1.28,1.54,1.54,,1.4360000000000002

4,Leanna C.,"Denver, CO",70,266,43.0,2.0,2017-12-21,It's just what you would expect from a TGI Friday's. It's over priced and the service is sub par. But the ability to go to a restaurant inside a hotel is a huge plus for most travelers. I would think this is one of the only reasons this location is still open.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia,1.32,1.52,1.52,,1.4400000000000002
