We walked in the door and stood at the host podium for a few minutes looking around waiting for someone to greet us. It took a little before I caught who I think was the manager's eye and he said we could seat ourselves in the bar or he could seat us at a table. After we sat ourselves the bartender came and he was very personable and pleasant and pointed out the happy hour menu. I was impressed with their late night happy hour and ordered a $5 Ultimate Electric Lemonade. When the drink came out I was happy it was a decent size. My bf got the wings and said they were good also.

I was very middle-of-the-road on eating there till I tried their Crispy Chicken Sandwich, as it is pretty good. The service is always pretty good, and they are never too busy at lunch time, which is when I go. I had been going about once a week, sometimes with a co-worker. Then why the two stars, you may ask, Because this place opens at 11, for lunch.  Lunch breaks are generally thirty minutes, or an hour. When a place says they open at 11, and want the ""lunch crowd"" then you better be on time. The last two times I went there, I arrived at 11am, on the dot.  The first time they opened late, I though it was a fluke, and no worries. The second time I went there for lunch I arrived at 11am, on the dot. One employee was getting dropped off for work, so it was obvious there was a paying customer. I waited....11:05....11:10.....11:15....door wasn't opened - no one visible. While I was sweating, in the heat - as my lunch break was ticking by. At 11:15 or so, I left and drove across the parking lot to one of the other places that opens at 11 (all were open....) and was promptly seated and served (despite there being a party of 100...yes 100...)

91,Linda B.,"Yucaipa, CA",0,39,,1.0,2014-07-08,"We were seated in the bar, waiter took our order and I gave him the Stripes #. After other people delivered the food we never saw him again. I stopped a bar tender passing by and asked if we could get the ranch dressing we ordered. The fries were old, cold, tough so I stopped another gal and asked if we could have something else since they were not edible. No one checked back to see if we were ok. Finally about 20 minutes after we were done eating I stopped the bar tender again and said we had waited a very long time for the bill and whatever happened to our initial server. With professional polish she said they worked as a team and got the bill for us. The bill was wrong as we were charged for the chips and salsa plus my Stripes number was not on it. She handed it off to some other guy who said he would fix it. He only brought back the credit receipt to be signed and I asked him where the receipt showing my account number was, he then brought back a small slip of paper stating how many stripes I had. It looked like the same amount I already had. Anyway, what a fiasco!!! The really troubling part was that the staff was saying how dead it was in there, no business, and when we left there were at least 5 staff standing around talking at the hostess station and one of them said basically thank you and have a nice day. I would have to think long and hard about going back to that Fridays. Some one should have had the courtesy to say the waiter was leaving for whatever reason and that we are handed off to someone else. The bar tender could only say that she was sorry that we fell through the cracks. Really? Slow business day and we were lost to the staff? I think of how patiently we waited before I flagged someone down and now I feel like an idiot. We asked where other TGIFriday's were located and basically there were only two left, the others were closed down by the owner is what a waiter said. Sad, because I really love the service and Jack Daniel's ribs that I get when in California, but Arizona has gone very astray.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix-5?start=80,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.468,3.3200000000000003

When our food finally arrived my son was to the bottom of his spaghetti bowl when he noticed something was wrong. My husband and I looked to find a roach lying in the bottom of the bowl. We sent our food back to the kitchen and asked for a manager. 15 minutes later the manager arrived and said he didn't know how this could happen and offered us free dessert.

My husband's ribs were also very flavorful and cooked just right.  They do however need to work on their sides. The coleslaw didn't taste like lime or ginger and was kind of soggy.

First off, the place was practically empty. The only reason we came here (I've sworn off this location for lousy service) was because the wait at the Red Robin next door was 20 minutes.

35,Kate H.,"Surprise, AZ",33,33,7.0,1.0,2016-04-19,"Today, our office decided to get TGI Fridays for lunch. We opened the website and the first thing we saw was the Lunch Pairings option. We decided this was a great deal so each employee wrote their order and we sent someone to order and pick up.  When she ordered, they were very rude and told her that that option was dine in only and made her feel badly about making an exception. Please note that it does not state ""dine in only"" on the website for this special, and its not much different than the same thing Applebee's and Chili's does- and they allow to-go. Also, its listed on a website- not an in-store menu. 2 people chose an option from the $8.99 price- on your website listed as Cajun Chicken Pasta. When our food got back to the office, we were pretty surprised to see that the ""Cajun Chicken Pasta"" consisted of mostly noodles, a couple pieces of SHRIMP (???) and a couple pieces of chicken. When I called the location to find out about the shrimp, I was spoken to as if I was stupid. I was informed that ""all of our pastas are shrimp and chicken"" and that we should have ordered it without shrimp. Which I would have, since I'm allergic. However, HOW WOULD WE KNOW THERE WAS SHRIMP IN A CAJUN CHICKEN PASTA?? The manager I spoke with did not seem interested in fixing the problem- just arguing about what the menu says. When I finally told him that I am allergic and not willing to die just to eat my $10 lunch (which is about $1.50 worth of sauce and noodles) and would they like to refund the money or replace the food, he said he would remake the entrees without shrimp, and we could pick them up.  You should probably update your website to reflect what the stores says, or train your stores to know what the website says- including disclaimers on deals not available TO-GO and fully listing the product and ingredients. Shrimp and shellfish is not an uncommon allergy and should be noted on any dish containing it. And maybe teach your staff and managers how to not be rude to customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix-5,2.68,2.68,2.68,1.4760000000000002,2.68

The chicken was grilled and ok. The waitress took it back and told me that she would have them make me a new one without the lemon. It took FOREVER for my new lunch to come out and my son was already done with his lunch.   The second salad tasted exactly like the first one albeit without the grilled lemon wedge on the side. Very overwhelming lemon taste.  The manager did come over and say that he tasted my salad and it was how they normally serve it. I told him that I had never tasted a caesar salad that tasted like LEMON .. he said well we are different here and walked away. He did take the salad off the bill (I did eat the chicken on a separate plate). JUST BE AWARE IF YOU ORDER THE SALAD, their normal dressing contains LEMON and a LOT of it.

66,Eric D.,"Glendale, AZ",79,12,,1.0,2016-11-20,"A few weeks ago my wife and I came in with our son and it was both of their first time at TGI Friday's... First off, let me just say that the food was AMAZING, the restaurant was very clean, and most of the staff was very friendly and helpful... except for our waitress (who will remain unknown) So to begin, my wife and I were seated 15-20 minutes before we were even greeted by our waitress, which would have been completely understandable had it been busy... But it was a Tuesday night and the woman had MAYBE two other tables besides ours. When she finally greeted us we both immediately caught on to the fact that she was obviously on some kind of drugs... Not sure if it was Adderall, cocaine, crack or meth, but it was definitely one of the four because the woman was absolutely spun out her mind. Which was surprising to us because the Norterra area is such a nice location. I would have been just as surprised if I saw this woman working at a Denny's in the ghetto. She was all over the place, cutting my wife off while she was asking questions about the menu, fidgeting and talking a hundred miles an hour... It was very uncomfortable, yet we remained polite and decided to give the woman the benefit of the doubt. We had plenty of time to look at the menu before she introduced herself so by now we had all already decided on what we were going to order. We asked to start with an appetizer and asked her if she would take our regular order as well and just put it in after the appetizer. She assured us that we would get our appetizer first. Our appetizer came out very quickly, immediately followed by our food. Our table was extremely overcrowded and we were now trying to inhale our appetizer so that our $15 Burgers didn't get cold. She then sets a piping hot pizza down in front of our 2 year old son. Luckily he is smart and knew the pizza was extremely hot. At this point we were pretty upset with our waitress but the atmosphere, staff and delicious food made up for it so we just let it roll off our shoulders. We finished our appetizer, and all three of our meals without ever being seen by our waitress... Not one refill, not one ""Hey how is everything guys"" NOTHING! Another waitress working in our section did eventually ask if there was anything that we needed and I asked for the check while biting my tongue. As soon as she walked away to get our check, our waitress pops around the corner, ""HEY GUYS HOW WAS EVERYTHING, DO WE NEED SOME REFILLS, SAVE ANY ROOM FOR DESSERT!?"" We just looked at each other in shock, and let her know that the other waitress was getting our check, to which she replied ""Oh okay, sorry about that"" and walked away. We didn't see her again after that... Our check was $65 and for the first time ever, I wrote a big fat ZERO for the tip. We ALWAYS tip 20% unless our service is lousy, then we may drop down to 15%. But we never leave without tipping. This woman really left a bad taste in our mouth but aside from her, everything else was great and we will definitely be returning, hopefully with a better experience. Our only regret was not leaving a tip for the girl who actually did help us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix-5?start=20,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04

61,David L.,"Phoenix, AZ",111,177,34.0,2.0,2017-02-17,"Ugh. Tonight was very disappointing. I get that there was a full house. I get that it was the dinner rush. But by the time we were seated to the time we were greeted? 45+ minutes. Like what? We only noticed no one has even said hello to us until we were basically done with our conversation. We only ordered water and even that took some time to get to us. I think our server was Monica? I don't think she was bad but probably just trying way too hard for an impression. Well, we ordered and I was trying to add cajun shrimp at the last minute and she basically just talked over me... she didn't write down that I wanted to add it. To myself, I knew my food would come out without it but I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt. Food did take some time to arrive but it was hot, so no big. But no shrimp so I had to ask again for that. I was just about done with my meal before it even came out... so yeah, that wasn't even worth the $6 extra for 6 pieces. My lady's food was actually not hot. It had cooled down before it made it to our table. My steak was ordered medium-well. It came out medium. She ordered well-done, it came out medium-well. I guess that's how it was working tonight. We didn't bother sending them back because we were hungry and we could deal with it. Parts of my steak were even rare. Yeah, not good at all. Our waitress saw us probably 1.5 times after we got our food. My water was empty the entire time. There was no refill. There was no check up until it was time for the check. Took less than 6 minutes for her to come back and get my credit card... hm. Nice. I did not want to tip her, however, understood the food couldn't be all her fault and I know they don't get paid a whole lot. I gave what I Thought was fair for the service we received. But I don't think I've ever regretted an $80 meal before. If we come back, it's probably not going to be for a long while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix-5?start=20,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28

33,Judy G.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,13,1.0,1.0,2017-03-21,"This place deserves 0 stars! I'm actually sitting here in the booth here while writing this, I'm so angry. Started off good, then half way through our meal the server just totally ignored us. Empty beverage cups as she walked by 5 times and helped the table next to us. When she finally came back. We ordered more drinks and a dessert and a cup of coffee. She must be a total airhead, she set the cup of coffee in front of my two year old, while I was loading my to go box. So obviously he grabbed it and spilled it all over himself and the floor. I was freaking out, and good thing they gave us cold f-ing coffee. No I'm sorry, no is your son ok, do you want another coffee... nothing. Then after they cleaned it up, I heard her say in he back ""well, what the f*ck do you want me to do?""... how about get a new career.

24,Honest J.,"Phoenix, AZ",86,107,6.0,1.0,2017-05-05,1 star given because they are not accommodating. Went there with family and requested a booth for 3 ppl. Young kid at the host stand said he can give us a half booth. Despite All the booths to the right being empty so I looked at him and he said that area was closed despite someone else dining in one of the booths.  Took us to the bar area with a gloomy half booth which I declined. I stating my displeasure with their seating arrangements and I clearly said we were going to Olive Garden which was next door. Needless to say we went to Oliver Garden where they did accommodate us with a real booth. Will never go back to TGIF's or at least this one. They don't mind losing customers to competitors and aren't accommodating. Management needs to wake up! I can spend my money elsewhere.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix-5,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
21,Amanda T.,"Mesa, AZ",163,154,62.0,1.0,2017-05-07,"I don't know where to begin this review because that's how bad the whole experience was.  From being greeted to waiting for my drink to being refill to rotten broccoli. When I sent back the broccoli no one said sorry. They brought a new plate that smelled like soap.  The jack Daniels chicken appetizers was burnt, my Jack Daniels flat iron was all fat and the bacon Jack Daniels burger was rare and bloody. The bacon was also under cooked.  The whole experience was terrible and now understand why TGIF is going out of business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix-5,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
27,Brandy C.,"Phoenix, AZ",34,104,6.0,1.0,2017-05-14,"Ugh.  So disappointing!  Today is Mothers Day.  I debated between Fridays and another favorite restaurant.  We live an hour away from TGI Fridays but still, I decided I wanted Fridays.  So we made the hour long drive.  So much, so wrong.   We sat in the bar area because of their happy hour specials.  We were seated at a high top and I asked if a fifth chair could be added as my husband was still parking.  She pulled up a chair and all was good.  Then a very snotty waitress came up and very rudely told us we had to move, we couldn't sit there with a fifth seat.  Annoyed, because I asked if the fifth seat could be added and was told yes but it is what it is, we picked up our belongings and squeezed into a half booth.   First drink order was wrong.  She forgot my drink.  Had to remind her.  Had to wait way too long for first appetizer.  Had to wait to ask for ranch then wait for the two little ranches for a family of 5.  Never offered refills.  Had to hunt down a manager to get a refill, order more food, and get boxes to go.  Waitress was just chilling behind the bar organizing glasses, even looked over at us several times but ignored us.  Manager was also chilling in back, my husband waved for him, he looked right at him and walked away.  We grabbed another employee who said manager was busy and were like, no he wasn't, he had been standing in back just chilling and talking to servers, our server included.  When he finally came, we told him what was going on and he offered no apologies and he was never to be seen again.  Sent items out that we requested and comp'd the to go order.  Still continued to wait, never bussed the table so we had plates stacked, and hanging off the edges.   The whole experience was awful and to think this was my Mothers Day pick and we drove an hour to have this terrible nightmare of an experience.  The one and only Fridays in the valley too.  So disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix-5,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
62,Alejandra D.,"Phoenix, AZ",90,2,,1.0,2017-05-14,"The whole experience was alright. Waiter was kind, but he kept forgetting about requests that we'd ask for such as bringing ranch, never offered refills, and our food took too long to come out. We did the always endless appetizers and had to wait 30 minutes to get our second refill of appetizers. Afterwards the manager was aware of the service that we had received and he came up to us telling us that that was going to be our waiters last night, implying that he was to be fired. We all thought this was completely unprofessional. We were given discounts on our food, but regardless I will not be returning to this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix-5?start=20,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04

We said no to bar seating and she said well I have a half booth which are only in the bar... so we said okay to a table... the same server that sat us was to be our server and when she sat us she didn't ask for our drinks or anything... we sat there for 20 minutes at least without a server not even looking at us... and we decided to get up and leave and just go next door to Olive Garden like everyone else does...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix-5,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002
23,Bernie M.,"Anaheim, CA",6,13,9.0,1.0,2017-06-10,"TGIF Happy Valley  Not much to be happy here about.  Arrived and was greeted cordially. We were seated and opened our cutlery to find that of the four settings two had food on them and on the napkin wrappers. Not spots of food or debris but large chucks. We mentioned this to our server and she noted that some of the staff tend to be lazy; we received new cutlery which was okay.  I ordered  glass of wine, after a sip or two I noticed that their was lipstick on it, not a lot but enough to be noticeable.  This annoyed my spouse and I enough that it ruined the evening from that point forward. I don't understand why in this day and age of high tech dish washers this still happens. Worse yet, the staff should catch this before it hits the table. The food: actually it was good, our grand kids enjoyed their kids meal and my pasta was great. I don't know if my spouse enjoyed the meal since the mood was dead. TGIF is a large corporation that has standards and guidelines.  They are not a mom and pop operation trying to figure this out. Why they don't have spot checks for quality control on ALL levels, dishes, cutlery, staff training, food presentation, etc. is beyond me.  Fortunately sites like Yelp are able to alert fellow clients of what to look for when they arrive. For me I will not be patronizing TGIF much more, and I figure they won't be missing my occasional $60 meals. But I won't be missing their cutlery either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix-5,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002
