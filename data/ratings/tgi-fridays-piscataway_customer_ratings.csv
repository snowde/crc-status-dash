20,Anthony H.,"Louisville, KY",1,4,,4.0,2012-01-09,"Went there on a Monday night, at first it was slow but picked up.  It was happy hour so they had good drink prices.  The food ordered was good.  From a guys standpoint there was a hot bartender in fish net hose.  The woman waiting table around the bar was really pretty and looked like a young Sarah Palin.  I don't care what you think of her politics Sarah is hot having punched out that many kids.  I actually got up the courage to tell the young lady how pretty she was and she was also very nice.  All and all it was a good night with typical TGI food and from a shovanistic male point of view a nice scene......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-piscataway?start=40,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544

37,Paul C.,"SKILLMAN, NJ",0,40,,1.0,2013-02-06,"9 am usually a huge Fridays fan - love the Jack Daniels everything and wait staff is usually serviceable and food dependable.  but this location is the Worst TGI Fridays ever.  Ordered 3 for all and was fine (hard to screw up 3 deep fryer items).  Daughter had chicken fingers which came out 5 mins before my meal which was medium rare filetand a lobster tail.  Waiter noticed i didnt get my meal went back and suddenly appear with it.  Steak wax 1/2 inch at best, full of gristle and nasty rare.  Lobster tail was so undercooked i almost vomited and spit it out and could not finish it.  Tried to end on a high note with velvet cake - disgustingly stale with dried frosting.  They were out of twp beers (how do you run dry of BOTH ingredients for a black and tan?)  so had to settle for third choice and irish coffee was so weak i thought i got ripped off. But what made this so much worse was 8 hours later i awoke to a 48 hour illness that can only be attributed to either the meat or lobster.  I will never eat a chain restaurant steak and certainly not a lobster again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-piscataway?start=20,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052
36,Stanley L.,"North Plainfield, NJ",161,130,606.0,1.0,2013-04-14,"I have no idea what has gone on with this place.  I have eaten here in the past and haven't been here in quite a while.  A friend and I visited this restaurant this past Friday and had one of the worst experiences.  This wasn't an issue with service but strictly due to food quality.  Now I know we are at Friday's and not a 5-star restaurant but the success in these chains lies in consistency.  No matter which one you visit it should be the same.  Unfortunately this was not the case here last Friday.   I ordered the Jack Daniels Steak/Ribs combo with a Baked potato.  First problem the steak had no flavor at all.  It was as if there was no Jack Daniels sauce put on the meat.  I felt as if I went to the supermarket and bought the managers special of the crappiest piece of steak.  Onto the ribs, they were dry and once again with no flavoring of the JD sauce.  Finally, the baked potato.  You are supposed to be able to eat a baked potato and the skin. We'll the skin was hard as a rock which pretty much means it was burned.  I thought something was wrong with just mine but my buddy was in the same position as me with his baked potato.   After we finished our ""meal"" here.  We actually headed over to another local restaurant and had some appetizers to fill our bellies with something that was tasteful.  I will not be coming back to this particular Friday's ever again.

Decided on a Jack Dainels Chicken sandwich over getting a salad. Always good for me. Most and seasoned as I like it.  It's a quiet Wed early evening.

Silver ware of previous customers is lying on the floor and paper napkins all around.  After a wait of 15 minutes our server informed us that he has many tables to attend to, hence couldn't get us our drinks on time. (This place is half empty)  With the above in mind I had no expectations with food. Shrimps were clearily not deveined. We had chrispy fried beans which was good.  My other option was BBW.

31,Roxana J.,"Metuchen, NJ",169,129,65.0,2.0,2015-02-18,Came here on a Monday afternoon for some lunch specials and drinks. The restaurant had very few patrons and the atmosphere was drab. This particular location didn't seem to be the cleanest either. We were sat at a table in the bar area in order to take advantage of the happy hour and our waitress/bartender was extremely inattentive. Our orders took a long time to come out and when they finally did they were wrong. I ordered salmon with langostino on top and the curry sauce that they drowned it in made it nearly inedible.

The bartender was friendly and efficient, getting in our food and drink orders quickly.  I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich, which looked good, but unfortunately things went downhill from there. After the first bite I hit what seemed like cartilage before realizing the entire chicken breast was hard and dried out (frozen and thawed or plain overcooked and overlooked?).

Never asked what kind of drinks we wanted nor stated any of the specials that were mentioned at other tables like Happy Hour & 1/2 off appetizers. Maybe our table didn't qualify for that? We told him to put an appetizer in first and then he took our order. Both appetizers & entrees came at the same time. By that time we just wanted to get out of there. The pro?

From that point I knew it would be a bad night. The waiter waited about 15 mins to actually greet us. Which I didn't let bug me considering game 7 of the NBA  finals was on & everyone was locked in. We both ordered the Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta. He put our order in then immediately came from the kitchen asked us to pick something else. Not only was this the meal the cook messed up at the near table, the restaurant ran out of Alfredo sauce. At this point I was over it and so badly wished I would've caught dinner in time at the hotel we stayed at.

Finally when we received our food there was no apology for the wait not even an acknowledgement of the wait. All in all, we will not be returning here. There are many other options in the area that will probably have better service and have the decency to apologize if the wait time is longer then expected.

After this experience I certainly have no intention of dining at this location any time soon.  Visited on Saturday,  3/4/17 and had the most rude server. Her name is Corrine and right from the start she had an attitude about serving myself and my parents. She was very short with us, acting very impatient as we made our decisions. And when I showed her my Stripes number on my phone, she took my phone out of my hands and then dropped it into the table instead of handing it back to me. She later came back to check the number again and once again took my phone and then dropped it on the table. The only reason I didn't say something to her was because my food hadn't come out yet.

2,Veronica L.,"New York, NY",3,85,,1.0,2017-11-15,"Against my better judgment, I decided to dine here because I was pressed for time to drive elsewhere.  The Good:  My server was very sweet, attentive, quick, and truly cared about doing a great job. The Bad: The food. I started with Broccoli Cheese soup. It was served on the cold side and had to be heated up. The broccoli was raw and tasted very bitter. It was gross but I ate around the raw broccoli because I didn't want to be a pain to the nice server who had to have it warmed up. Then I ordered boneless chicken wings. I was served mostly bits of fried batter with a few bits of very dry chicken. Again, very gross. Lastly, I ordered a house salad of which a quarter was inedible because it consisted of brown rotten lettuce. I left thirty dollars later completely unsatisfied and feeling totally gross from eating such terrible food.  I do take some responsibility for going to Friday's in the first place because I knew I was in for chain restaurant food. I just wish I was proven wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-piscataway,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
3,Jennifer G.,"Somerville, NJ",3,59,324.0,1.0,2017-11-21,"We came out to celebrate a birthday tonight. There was no wait we got seated right away. We choose to play a game on this computer on the table, although we did not swipe a credit card thru it added $2.00 to our bill. I don't think I like this computer thing at all now why didn't it tell us it would be added to our bill??? Ok on to the food, I ordered cup of clam chowder and it is horrible was not hot 1 piece of clam, broth was watery, potatoes hard and extremely salty. Tip do not order the clam chowder!!! Salmon was ok vegies fine and rice good. Our server was bad she barely spoke to us then only came once to our table. While I sit here thirsty I can see her in the back talking away with other employees drinking a cup of beverage. Mean while I sit here with nothing to drink!!! Seriously terrible I do not even want to leave her a tip!!! Bad service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-piscataway,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24

I ordered it just now and kept biting at it for a while(would not break) I asked the waitress is this microwaved? She said yes.  I could not break the pieces of chicken biting into it.  I guess I'll ask from now on, what is actually cooked back there?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-piscataway,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
