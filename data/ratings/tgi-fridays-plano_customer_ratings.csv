67,Sylvia E.,"Kingwood, Houston, TX",26,99,8.0,2.0,2012-11-04,"Been there on a Saturday night and I was wondering why the parking lot was so empty. Normally parking lots in front of good places burst with cars. Well, I was about to find out.  The food was ok, but the service was soooooooooooooooooooooo slow, A restaurant that's merely half full and the food takes so long?  Also the waiter was't that attentive. My husband had to call him several times to get a refill for the soda. How hard can that be. Normally you expect eyes concentrating on tables, evaluating what they need, but not here.  Not too great of an experience. I don't know what happened, last time I was hear was early in the year and it was great. I can't imagine I caught a bad day, or didn't I? Don't know.

78,Mark G.,"Allen, TX",28,2,1.0,2.0,2013-01-11,"Went with my wife on a weeknight. The place was pretty slow with only about 30% of the tables occupied. During our entire stay, we only saw our waiter about four times: once to take our drinks, once to take our orders, once to bring our check and then one more time to return it. We stayed for well over an hour, and it was due to the fact that the service was so poor. Underwhelming food which almost immediately upset our stomachs paired with poor service left us with a bitter taste in our mouths.

When I unrolled my napkin, I noticed the knife was DIRTY. I asked for another which I never received. We ordered food and regret immediately started setting in.

I'll be honest, I stopped going to Fridays because their food got really greasy and salty... Then they tried to revamp the menu, which has a few good items...but nothing really kept my attention. Needless to say, my experience yesterday was in a way the same... My boyfriend had ordered a full rack of ribs. It was caked in a sweet BBQ sauce. Nothing really stood out but nothing particularly ""bad"" either. I had the Spicy Craft Beer-Cheese Burger - avocado, jalapeños (some of my all-time fave burger toppings). The toppings were great, but the burger was again, nothing special. We ended our dinner with Whiskey Cake. The syrup around it was extremely sweet, making the already sweet cake super-saturated... but the vanilla ice cream made it better!

101,Bill B.,"Dallas, TX",102,580,1772.0,3.0,2013-10-27,"The restaurant had very few customers on a Sunday morning. We were promptly seated in  a booth. The cushion needed to be replaced, as we sank almost to the floor. Ask for table seating to avoid this discomfort. Ordered the special which was a ""pick two"" for $12. Had the lettuce wedge which was good however ""wedges"" are hard to eat at best. This one was fresh and the lettuce crisp. For an entrée had the fried shrimp (12) which was the second half of the ""two for $12"". The shrimp were ""small to medium"" in size. They were okay however not great. The batter was a little sweet for me. French fries were served with the shrimp and the fries were rather crispy. Another in the party has the Parmesan Crust chicken, which was small but good. It was accompanied by a tomato entree which was also good. The menu by the way is extensive and you may need more than a couple of minutes to review all of it. Check carefully the ""specials"" as some of those items have little or no savings over regular menu prices. The tea was very good. Wait service was excellent and the manager came around to check on our booth. Rest rooms were clean. The entire restaurant is somewhat outdated and reflects the long period of time this particular location has been opened. Parking was right at the front door.

Get service right away, the team works together and we get our food right away. The bar does an awesome job and high five to the food running team as well. When i ate my pasta, i was still hungry and asked if it was too late for the $15 appetizer entree deal, i was pleased to hear the male bartender tell us its not too late at all for $3 heck he said he'd do it too! Id say he goes above and beyond most bartenders. I think a man sitting across from us was being cheap and asking for some type of comp meal & most bartenders dont even care to deal with too much of that, he got questions answered for the man.

When I sent it back because I'd ordered a frozen margarita, the bartender said I should order a regular margarita. Because that's obviously what I wanted. NOT. And I totally love waiting over a half hour to even order food after that. The servers never brought water to anyone at the table before I left ~40 minutes after arriving.

From the time we sat down, the service was pretty bad. The hostess didn't greet us. We waited for 10 minutes for our waiter to come. The food took over an hour to get to the table from the time we placed an order. An hour! What were you doing? Chasing a cow for meat?!? The restaurant wasn't even remotely crowded. I tried to flag down the waiter, who ignored me a couple of times. Our drinks weren't getting refilled - after an hour and half of sitting down, someone finally came to re-fill our drinks.

Shook my hand and thanked me for my service. He was about to hand me my food when his manager pulled him aside and began chewing him out. I heard the whole thing. ""How are we going to make tip money off these guys! The deal is they come in and buy other stuff and bring people with them so we can make a profit. This isn't a hand out its a money maker. Don't do this again!""    I was shocked to say the least and as a a two time Iraq war veteran not looking for a hand out it made me feel incredibly dirty. He handed me the food I left him a tip and said I was sorry. He shook his hand and said there was no need.  I will not be back there nor will I ever frequent any TGIF ever again. I do not need a free meal. But if you offer one as a thank you for someones service then it should be just that. Horrible service and made me feel incredibly uncomfortable.

I ordered a Cobb salad that was OK, but I got to hear about the hamburger, then to have the waitress send the manager to ""comp"" the burger in an attempt to please my date. At 45 mins on a weekday lunch we had run out of time and there was no fixing it at that  point. Thanks Fridays for extra points with the date when it was me that wanted to go there. Then  I thought I would do the Cobb salad tonight, but alas it was a worse disaster. A partially cooked piece of chicken, half cooked, half raw but warm. Grilled but cooked only on one half of one side. How did you do that? It had some grill color to it so as the waitress pointed out it was not microwaved badly?  Are you cooking half frozen chicken on your grill?  Anyway, I paid in full as I am a stubborn and want what I used to get, not some half ass attempt or comp'ed food that is neither worthy of billing or eating.  So here it is... I let corporate know, and I will be back, Don't take crappy delivery as an excuse for service.  Give feedback directly to corporate if you like your restaurant but have an abysmally bad experience. Then go again, and see what is what.

I paid for my ticket then said something to Jack the manager who looked like he would have tried to make the situation better earlier if the server would have mentioned it. I was not trying to look for a free meal which is why I paid for it but a waist of money heading to Chilis with my favorite waiter Kc thank goodness,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-plano?start=60,2.56,2.56,2.56,1.5400000000000003,2.56
83,Elizabeth W.,"Plano, TX",0,4,,1.0,2015-06-16,Seriously the worst restaurant ever. From now on we'll be driving back to the tgi Fridays off park and Preston (where we used to live and go ALL the time and had NO problems ever!) Tonight we went (against our better judgement) only because we didn't want to drive to another one. We sat in the bar area and after about 5 minutes the manager gave us menus and said our waiter would be right with us. After about 5 more minutes still nobody came so we left. (They weren't busy) Pretty sad when your there 10-15 minutes and the manager is the only one who says a word to you. He could have at least got our drinks started for us. Then as we left the manager watched us walk out. Seriously just the worst.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-plano?start=60,2.56,2.56,2.56,1.6360000000000001,2.56

100,Erica R.,"Plano, TX",0,3,1.0,1.0,2015-07-31,"By far the worst service both by management and our server. I arrived and was not greeted  within 7 minutes and had to ask another server for a drink. We did not receive appetizer plates when we received our spinach dip. I had asked another server if he could grab us some appetizer plates. He had stated that he would, and I never received the appetizer plates. We finally received our entrees and could not begin eating since we had not received silverware. I had to get up and ask for silverware, and by this time I was already pretty upset and had asked to speak to a manager. The manager arrived at the table to ask if everything was okay. I explained to him my occurrence and what had happened. The lack of service, and not receiving what I had asked for or was promised.. The manager apologized and said he would have better coaching for his employees. He asked what can I do to fix this? Honestly, a manager should have trained experience and not have to have me tell him what I would like him to fix, and offer to discount my meal for the disturbance. I didn't care to eat my meal. Literally did not touch it to be literal. The fact that I had to pay 16 dollars for an entree and receive this crappy of a service was uncalled for. I receive better service at McDonald's. The server didn't even come to apologize or ask if anything was wrong seeing that the manager had come over to our table and had spoken to us. My brother didn't care to complain since he didn't want to be one of those people. Honestly, if the server had communicated with me that she was busy, or that she forgot.. I would have been fine and understanding. The fact that there are servers just lounging and not attending to customers needs irritates me. If you don't care to work.. Please go home!

What they don't tell you is that it only applies to one appetizer. For example, it's not like you can order wings the first time and then order potato skins the next. You just get endless amounts of the same thing over and over again until you get sick of it. However, if you get the boneless wings, you can get a different flavor each time. So in that sense $10 isn't bad. But you can get the variety of endless appetizers with an upgrade of $2. So that's what my hubby got. The flavored were weird and the batter is pretty thick. They weren't the greatest chicken nuggets, yet again they were unlimited. I was disinterested in the same endless app, so I got the strawberry fields salad. It was huge, so it was filling and yummy.  Most likely won't be back in awhile. There's nothing special about this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-plano,2.48,2.48,2.48,1.9640000000000002,2.48
65,Carli S.,"Plano, TX",94,8,1.0,1.0,2015-08-16,I came here after having seen a commercial on tv for unlimited appetizers for 10 dollars! Oh was I wrong. It's really 12 dollars PER PERSON for unlimited appetizers. 10 PER PERSON for one appetizer over and over. I was willing to at least ask to see if we could share but didn't even get the chance cause the waitress would never come back over. I believe her name was Miranda. MIRANDA needs to be fired!!! She's definitely not doing her job. We sat there for over 30 minutes plenty of time for you to come to your table after 9 o clock with hardly anyone there. Finally I decided to just go. I mean shit she paid full attention to the full table of guys sitting behind us. She never came to help us though. When we got up after not hearing from our waiter for a super long time a girl who wasn't even our waitress asked us if everything was ok we told her that we were done waiting she asked us if we'd wait til she went and got the manager and the manager would give us coupons. I think that's pretty admirable she stepped up when the girl wouldn't do her job. I was half tempted to stay and talk to the manager to get free coupons until I thought about it and realized why would I ever went to come back to this establishment?! I told her no thanks and walked out. It was my first time at one and most definitely my last. I would never recommend this place to anyone.

6,Dena R.,"Allen, TX",166,195,200.0,2.0,2015-08-17,"We headed here for lunch on Sunday late afternoon thinking about their $10/$12 endless appetizer offer.  We hadn't been here for at least 6 months or so.  The first thing that struck me was the parking lot was really dirty!  I don't usually take much notice of the parking lot, but this one really caught my eye with bottles and cans everywhere.  There was also someone sitting in a van in the handicap spot with the car running, during the entire hour+ we were there.  Kind of sketchy. While the endless appetizer offer might sound good, pretty much everything on the allowed appetizer menu (yes, there is a limited menu) consists of bread or potatoes.  Boneless wings are on the menu too.  Not really worth it in my opinion! So, we settled on one of our favorites, fried green beans.  We asked for extra cucumber-wasabi ranch.  The portion we received was miserable.. MUCH less than any other time we've been here.  And no, they could not have been confused and thought it was an ""endless appetizer"" portion because green bean fries are not on the endless appetizer menu.  What we received was definitely not worth the almost $8 charged.  For entrees, I ordered the cajun shrimp and chicken pasta (no shrimp) and the bf ordered the Jack Daniels mixed grill with chicken and a half rack of ribs, with double mac & cheese.  I was asked if I wanted to buy a breadstick for my pasta for 99 cents.  Really?  Way to nickel and dime me! My pasta entree was a noticeably smaller portion then when we used to come here before.  And it had 2 shrimp in it, like they made it the normal way, realized I didn't want shrimp, and picked (most of) them out.  What if I'd been allergic?  Plus, then my pasta was sorely lacking on chicken.  His meal had a lot of meat, which I did not try.  The mac & cheese was penne pasta with a melted white cheese on top, I tried it and it overwhelmingly tasted like butter.  Gross. Service was good, didn't really have an issue there.  Except, there were WAY more servers than seemed appropriate.  The restaurant was maybe 1/4 to 1/3 full and at one point I saw 10 servers (no joke, I counted) congregating around one of the POS systems.  Maybe it was shift change, but there were so many of them standing around just shooting the shit, that the servers actually working and coming out of the kitchen had to squeeze by them every time.  There's usually a server/manager or two sitting at the table on the side, back by the POS system every time I've been here.  I find that kind of odd as well.  Our bill was higher than I expected and certainly not worth the food we received. Long story short, portions are smaller, prices are higher, and we won't be back anytime soon.  We did not see a manager the entire time we were there and the clear vibe in this restaurant is no one (save for a few dedicated servers) cares.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-plano,2.4,2.4,2.4,1.8960000000000001,2.4

I've had the potato skins at this location and they were bitter. (How do you manage to make potato skins bitter?) The fried green beans were not good.

I've spoken to several people who stopped visiting fridays, but they say about 20 years ago the food actually used to be good. The staff is fantastic.

We chose to sit at the bar.  First off, the service was terrible. We quickly ordered our food first since it would probably take awhile for it to come out. We just ordered a few appetizers: wings, potato skins, and mozzarella sticks. We then ordered some drinks. The long island iced tea was alright, a little heavy with gin in my opinion. The watermelon drink was not good. Like is tasted fine, it just tasted like juice. I could barely taste the alcohol. It wasn't worth the cost. After finishing two very light drinks and waiting for about 30 minutes, we decided the wait was way too long. We asked the guy working the bar to check on our order. He said they were backed up in the kitchen so our food hasn't even been prepped yet let alone cooked. We decided to cancel our orders and just close the tab. He told us he would be right back... That was definitely a lie. After waiting another 15 minutes, he finally came out...with our food. Um, I told you we were in a hurry and to cancel our order since it was too far down the line. I did not ask you to run in and prep my food as fast as possible and throw it together in a box.  We just decided to take the food anyway since he already brought it out. The food wasn't even good. I've been here a few times, but this just was bad. I mean, I wasn't really surprised since it was made as fast as possible. In conclusion, don't come here if you want a relatively fast meal. I expected the wait to be 20 minutes, but not half an hour plus more time. Get it together, guys.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-plano,2.08,2.08,2.08,1.3160000000000003,2.08

It was sticky and had crap all over it. The lady seemed pretty irritated to have to deal with it. Then there was the service.... absolutely terrible. I hate giving bad reviews but dang it, if I spend good money to eat out the least you could do is gwtvour drinks to us in under 20 minutes! 3 waters, a tea, and a margarita.... not difficult. The waitress finally comes back smelling like an ashtray with our drinks. One of our party spilled his margarita by accident and it took a solid 10 minutes for someone to come clean it up! 10 minutes!! Everyone at the bar heard the glass break but they just let it sit.... seriously???  The food took a good 45 minutes which is crazy considering we were the only table in there.

It took a solid 15 minutes for the shots to come, and we placed our food order while waiting.  We ordered half pasta orders since it was so late in the afternoon. They food came out and it was laughable to call it a half order. More like a 1/4 order (I know because I've had the full order and it's huge!). Then the ""cajun alfredo"" tasted more like a slightly hot pesto. There were 2 pieces of chicken TOTAL and 2 shrimps. That's crap.  My husband got the three cheese pasta which should have been called ""tomato and garlic chunk pasta."" It also had BARELY ANY meat in it, but more than 20 whole cloves of roasted garlic. I'm not exaggerating, we started counting after he at about 5 of them. He always finishes his plate, but not this time.  These dishes were a joke and extremely dissatisfying.

This location offers a third of the other one. As far as service it was decent enough. The waiter made a point of sating he was new and he did keep our glasses filled. The one major drawback was at the payment of the check. My friend had a digital emailed coupon he wanted to us. So the server proceeds to take his phone to the back to show the manager. Any other location would have written down the code to apply it. What's worse is the server was gone for about 20 more minutes with the phone. That's just too long! So my friend asked another server about the phone and his response was that we could have printed it out. In this day and age of technology that seemed like a lame response.

Spend a couple of extra dollars more and go somewhere down the street like BJ's restaurant. There are plenty of other good places to eat in this area instead of this Fridays. I ordered a jack Daniels bourbon barrel chicken that came with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. The plate they brought it out was very huge but the amount of food offered was quite small. There appeared to be about one scoop of steamed broccoli and a scoop or two of mashed potatoes.  The chicken tasted rubbery and on par with something you would get at a fast food restaurant.  The only thing on the plate that was good was the steamed broccoli, and there wasn't much of that. That was $12.  I also ordered a whiskey cake dessert with a scoop of ice cream. The menu photo made it look a heck of a lot bigger and better. It had a good taste to it, but it wasn't very big and for $8, I was expecting something more. I sat at the bar and the bartender, Barbara, was fairly nice and friendly. The bar was clean except it had a very peculiar smell to it. It had one of those musky dirty bar smells and I don't think I would sit at the bar again.  The rest of the restaurant looked fairly clean but there weren't many customers. The smell coming from behind the bar was enough to almost make me not want to finish eating. I was in there at about 2 PM and it took about 20-25 minutes for the kitchen to get done with the food. The bartender had to go back twice to see what was taking so long and there probably weren't but about 10 people in the entire restaurant dining. Overall, this place does not compare to the Fridays in Addison on beltline. I don't know if it is a franchise and the management just doesn't care, but the food wasn't good, the bar smelled, service was slow and the manager on duty, I think his name is Juan, isn't very friendly and seems to speak broken English. It's hard for him to communicate. One would think the restaurant would put someone in a management position that had social skills and spoke better English. Overall, value wise, you're not going to get your moneys worth at this restaurant. Like I mentioned, spend a couple extra dollars and go somewhere else in the area. You'll get better food, better service and a better environment.
