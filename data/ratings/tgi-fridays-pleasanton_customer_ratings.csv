3,Marie L.,"Mountain House, CA",6,63,14.0,1.0,2012-01-08,If you want microwaved food at a restaurant this is the place to go. The service was horrible and the food was also. Save your money and just make your food at home it will probably turn out better and will actually be warm.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pleasanton?start=20,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96
19,David C.,"Daly City, CA",37,10,,4.0,2012-01-21,"Their food is pretty good, it's a chain so you can't expect much. It can be pricey for chain food though. I recommend anything on their Jack Daniels menu, the sauce is amazing. I come in here with a pretty large group every other week or so and they are very accommodating for us. Their 9:00pm happy hour is perfect for us and you can't beat $2 beers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pleasanton?start=20,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08

58,Neil S.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,2,,2.0,2012-02-02,I came here a few months back and wanted to write a review and forgot.   I wanted to go somewhere and watch the NBA finals and have a beer. The Tv's in this bar are about 20 years old. They are so small you could never distinguish what the score was. It is not a good place to go and watch a game.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pleasanton,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
57,Omer M.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,55,12.0,1.0,2012-02-14,Over cooked veggies and bland food. Starters were okay. Bruschetta tastes like quick $1 noodles. Not coming again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pleasanton,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
48,Angie R.,"San Francisco, CA",276,142,18.0,3.0,2012-03-11,"My fiance and I were looking for a late night meal and found exactly what we were looking for at TGI Friday's. It was late and we decided to sit at the bar but quickly moved when a fight broke out. We were moved to the other side of the restaurant and started to order. My fiance ordered the sliders and a hot green tea for starters.  We then ordered the Bruschetta Chicken Pasta and a Turkey Burger with salad.  Unfortunately, as the server approached our table with the sliders she dropped them on the floor. She was extremely apologetic and before she could put in another order for the sliders we cancelled it. I am glad that we did because when the rest of our meal came to the table and we began to eat our dinner it was just enough food.  I was completely satisfied with my meal and overall experience. I can't wait to try something new on their menu.  Hope to be back very soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pleasanton,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
13,Rob M.,"Pleasanton, CA",17,22,,2.0,2012-03-18,"OK place to meet for a drink in the bar, but the restaurant just has no life or energy to it.  Nothing has changed in TGI Fridays since it's inception and I just can't shake the feeling that I am eating in an airport waiting for my flight...that's the vibe.  There is hardly ever a crowd here, which is great if you want to slip in and out, but if you want some life and energy to your night out, look elsewhere.  Food is about the same as the menu itself, looks great as a glossy photo, tastes like cardboard.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pleasanton?start=20,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
18,Erez K.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,41,,4.0,2012-03-30,"Every day happy hour starts at 9 (and sometimes sooner). Pretty good beer selection and the happy hour prices make it a sweet deal. It is not loud at all and we are able to have pretty good talks there. The service is very good.  It is where we get together for our weekly guys' beer night.  All 10 of us gave it a unanimous vote for being our regular place. We are all family men, most of us work in high tech, you get the picture.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pleasanton?start=20,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
40,Priyam S.,"San Francisco, CA",15,9,24.0,3.0,2012-04-19,"I came to this TGIFriday with a few of my friends from my weightwatchers groups after one of our meeting.  We decided it would be nice to treat ourselves to a little indulgent food after all of out hard work at losing weight.  the food was pretty average and the service was good.   My main complaint was the lack of nutritional facts menus.  They keep only one on each table.  This made it a bit difficult for all 5 of use to take turns looking up what we wanted and how it would fit in with our diet.  It took use a totally of 30 minutes just to decided what we wanted because of the lack of these menus.  Also when we asked for more of them the waiter only gave us one more with helped a bit but in reality all 5 of use needed the nutritional facts menu.   I would probably visit this place again, but its not really anything special.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pleasanton,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
44,Mike S.,"San Francisco, CA",95,337,29.0,2.0,2012-04-26,"went there mid-week for lunch as I was working on a project near by.  The food took FOREVER to come-out, and place wasn't busy at all. we ended up getting the food to go, since we didn't have the time to actually sit down and eat once the food came out.  Service was decent, but c'mon, there's nothing but business parks in that of town, so get it together folks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pleasanton,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
