30,Suzanne T.,"North Attleboro, MA",24,100,5.0,2.0,2013-12-29,I came here specifically for ribs.

How do you run out of something that makes up a majority of your meals at 6 at night on the weekend before Christmas?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-plymouth-2?start=20,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001
39,Henry D.,"West Wareham, MA",0,7,,1.0,2014-01-18,I will start with the good. The staff was pleasant and the food was good. Now for the bad. My wife and I sat at the bar. First you can smell bleach and beer yeast. So you can tell the bar is not cleaned well nightly. It is a slow Saturday afternoon about 2:00pm. Two bartenders for 11 customers. Both bartenders are way to into a conversation with 3 of the guests at the bar. My wife got up to go to the bathroom and I waited to order drinks. The bartender put down two napkins made my drink did not make my wife's. Wife came back and it took 5 minutes before she looked back and realised she forgot her drink. We ordered food and it was prompt. Never was asked if everything was OK. When it was time to get our check it took 15 minutes. In this time I was trying to make eye contact. She cleared a check the was left next to us but left the beer bottle.  Other glassware was left around the bar unattended to.  Both were standing to the left within direct line of site talking not paying attention to the rest of the bar. I had to interrupt the conversation to get my bill. They just did not seem to care about being at a job. It was slow and yet the sinks were full of glasses to be cleaned. Over all a bad experience. Bar staff needs to be retrained.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-plymouth-2?start=20,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003

I will say though that the last time I was at this particular one the bartender working was kind of gross. He looked like he just rolled out of bed hungover and hadn't showered in two days. He was a little pudgy and wearing a tee shirt that was probably two sizes to small for him, but the waist on his pants was two sizes to big with no belt so his hairy plumbers crack was showing.

We have her our complete order, told her I was in a hurry with only 40 minutes left. It took her ten more minutes to bring me a flat soda, five minutes to tell me they were out of potstickers, ten more minutes to come back because they are or of buffalo sauce and twenty minutes for my cold nasty food to arrive. I ordered an appetizer and a kids meal! The girl who ran the cold food to the table finally brought me a new soda which was also flat and the waitress only came back to drop the check.

31,Devon D.,"Forestdale, MA",1,17,5.0,2.0,2015-05-07,"I visited TGI Fridays in Plymouth on May 5th and have a good time with my friends. The host greeted us with great energy and welcomed us very friendly. The server was very pleasant and happy to be taking care of us. She had other tables but still kept us feeling we were in good hands.  We ordered strawberry margaritas but very disappointed by the drinks.  We had 1 strawberry in each drink and watched the bartender cram a ton of ice in our half filled drinks. They also tasted like salt water and asked for a remake but the server stated what you never had a margarita before.  Coming from another bartender I never made or tasted a margarita that was so unpleasant and unenjoyable especially on Cinco De Mayo. So we ordered another round to make up for it but still had to pay for the first round.  We enjoyed our food and service and my second margarita in which was patron silver, grand marine, organic agave and orange juice.  Very tasty, small but good to sip on and very pricey.  Overall the service was good, and the craft beer cheese was fabulous.

Everytime that I have been here my server or bartender was great however there have been a few times where I have seen the woman manager with the short hair be very rude and condescending to her employees. One time I was sitting at the bar with a friend and witnessed her yell at a training bartender on the floor in front of all of the guests. When she noticed we saw she tried to cover up and change the subject to some wine promotion. It was very offputting and made me not want to support a restaurant that doesn't support their staff.

25,Kit K.,"Benicia, CA",0,4,1.0,1.0,2016-07-12,"I was visiting from out of town and we were looking for a place to eat after a long, hard day.  It was kind of late, but TGI Fridays was open.  I have always had good luck with the TGI Fridays by where I live, so thought I would get the same in Plymouth.  I WAS VERY WRONG.  To start, we ordered drinks.  The waitress had to come back 3 times for me and 4 times for my brother, to tell us that they didn't have those drinks available.  Initially all of the beer taps were broken, so nothing on tap was available.  That's understandable, things break, but then they were out of every bottled beer we asked for as well.  The food was not fresh at all.  I had the hot wings and they came with celery sticks.  I couldn't eat the celery sticks because they look like they had been sitting out for several days and were shriveled-up.  They were also out of the first item my brother ordered - he had to re-order that as well. The waitress was very apologetic, I didn't blame her for anything, and gave her a normal tip because none of it was her fault.  This is obviously a management problem as they were understaffed, out of far too many items and they lack the conscience to support their support staff.  I felt really sorry for her.  She must get horrible tips because she is so under-supported.  I would never go back there.  I hope corporate TGI Fridays sees this and does some sort of intervention.  That place will go out of business if my experience is replicated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-plymouth-2?start=20,,,,,

The fries I ordered on the side were cold & everything just seemed to be thrown together as if it was rushed. The ribs I ordered were okay but 2/3 of the food items I ordered were of poor quality.

1,Michelle S.,"Boston, MA",1,11,,1.0,2017-12-31,"This restaurant is completely mismanaged and unprofessional. I could not believe the employee locked us out in the cold today, that was so unacceptable. We will not ever go back. This morning at 11:05 my husband got out of the car to make sure the store was open as the parking lot was empty. Both doors were open, the sign on the door said they open at 11am and he saw an employee setting up. He returned and we got both of our daughters out in the 15 degree weather to go in but when we approached the doors the employee had locked both sets of doors. We knocked but no one came over so we got back in the car and left. I have to say this is not an isolated incident at this particular restaurant. Another time we came around 11:30 am and were told that the staff was very low and we would be better off going across the street to Red Robbin. Another time employees were arguing in front of customers. Completely ridiculous and unprofessional.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-plymouth-2,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88
