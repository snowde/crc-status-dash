3,Dean N.,"San Francisco, CA",39,108,95.0,1.0,2013-04-13,I have been here many times and to many Fridays throughout the US. This place is a grand example of everything that could be wrong with this franchise. Even trying to rate this restaurant against others in the chain this fares very poorly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-port-charlotte?start=20,,,,,
24,Steve L.,"North Port, FL",40,18,20.0,4.0,2014-06-01,Good service and decent food! Not too busy and wait staff was very attentive.  Definitely worth considering for dinner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-port-charlotte,,,,,
22,Gus S.,"Pasadena, CA",23,33,22.0,1.0,2014-12-28,Not a normal level of quality  had the worse order of pork ribs   Basically dry and no meat  not even one hot dog worth of meat on the full slap combined   I will never visit here again   Service was good bit all food was below even a D -1/2 star rating,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-port-charlotte,,,,,
5,Selmy B.,"Sarasota, FL",38,335,357.0,3.0,2015-01-03,Service is spot on as is the bar service. The kitchen unfortunately is struggling with the big parties. The appetizers are delicious. The outdoor seating is great when traveling with our dog. The staff is very friendly and doesn't forget that you are seating outside.  The dumplings are delicious and fresh. The pretzels are hot but could use more sauce. The nachos have a nice twist. Nice spot.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-port-charlotte,,,,,
19,Tundra D.,"Dacula, GA",8,71,12.0,1.0,2015-02-25,"Went here last night with a friend to grab some dinner. I ordered the ribeye(cooked medium), mac n cheese, mashed potatoes, and side salad. Steak came out medium rare instead of medium. The server asked if I wanted it cooked more, but I refused. NEVER send steaks back because throwing them back on a grill will do nothing but ruin them and make them tough. I use to eat steaks medium rare so I will usually let it slide if it's slightly undercooked.  I take the first bit of the steak and immediately spit it into a napkin. It was rancid and rotting tasting meat.  Keep in mind, I'm a hunter and field dress my own deer, hogs, etc... So I don't have a weak stomach. This steak though....horrible.  Chugged some sweet tea to try and get the taste out of my mouth, but it stuck with me for a good 15 min. Kept feeling like I needed to puke for a little bit.  Server took the steak away and I just requested a grilled piece of chicken.  Not sure if their cooler/freezer has issues, bad meat, I dunno but serving someone a ribeye that tastes like rotting meat is unacceptable. It's now 8:15 am the next morning and I've had 5 trips to the bathroom throughout the night and this morning. Hello Hershey squirts!!!  Stay clear of this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-port-charlotte,,,,,
16,Kim W.,"North Port, FL",51,347,306.0,1.0,2015-04-11,"Go somewhere else, seriously.   We've eaten here a couple of times in the past year.  We have sat at the stools by the bar, in a booth, and the service was terrible every single time. The first time, when sat by bar, we ordered wings and mozzarella sticks, and entrees.  The waiter totally forgot about us and we had to just ask for our entrees to go because it took forever to even get the,.  I didn't feel like sleeping there for the night just to get my sandwich. The last time, tonight, we walked in to a pretty empty Friday's.  Our waitress, Lora, took our orders promptly.  We started with endless appetizers, mozzarella sticks to start and some drinks.  The drinks came out a few minutes later, and she took our main order.  When she left, she said our mozzarella sticks would be right out. Five minutes later, we are still waiting when they finally arrive and we dive in.  We order the next app, boneless wings.   Before we know it, someone brings us ""our food"", which was totally not.  I ordered sizzling chicken and spinach and hubby ordered the Jack Daniels chicken sandwich, no onions or mayo.  The food placed before us was sizzling chicken and shrimp and a chicken sandwich with nothing but onions.  No Jack Daniels sauce at all. When we called the manager over, she took our food and said she would let our waitress know.  No apologies.  Then our waitress comes back with the same dishes and tells us that this is our order.  We had to be persistent and point out what we saw wrong with what food they were trying to force us to eat. So she took the food back with our next app order, the spicy chicken tostadas, with no sriracha mayo or jalapeños.  And then proceeded to tell us that she told the kitchen, no worries about the wait, as ""they have endless appetizers"". The proper entrees finally come out, but the chicken sandwich has no cheese or Jack Daniels sauce still.  At this point, we don't care about the sauce. When the finally appetizer arrives, there is extra sriracha mayo on top and on the nacho itself.  It was the final straw.  We asked for the bill, left too much of a tip (as dining etiquette states you should leave) and left. The manager never came back to apologize at all, even though she was fully aware of the situation.  Not a comped item.  They charged me for every single one of my three tea refills.  Definitely filling out the survey to send to Friday's corporate office.   Now, I've been home for over 90 minutes and cannot part with my bathroom.  Thanks Friday's, I didn't need to enjoy my weekend at all,  I beg you to stay away!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-port-charlotte,,,,,
1,Deborah R.,"Dade City, FL",3,12,,5.0,2015-09-30,the best steak (Jack Daniels ribeye) anywhere in P.C. better and cheaper than the steak houses. Other food yummy too. I ALWAYS leave here with a full tummy and a big smile. The service is great and the management cares. Way to go TGIF. This is my personal favorite restaurant,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-port-charlotte?start=20,,,,,
2,Alex G.,"Punta Gorda, FL",0,4,,1.0,2015-11-11,"When my wife and I had walked in it looked like a war zone. It was a mess. The host finally sat us. We received no silverware. Our sever Jeff took forever to come over and when he did you could clearly tell he was stoned or on some other kind of drugs. He didn't really seem to care we were there. He asked us what we wanted and repeated it back wrong. At the same time we ordered potatoe skins. It took 15 mis for our first drink we ordered from the bar. The when we finally came back we ordered a drink for my wife which again took another 15 mins. She ordered the cotton candy drink and it was already mixed when she received it warm. In the meantime our potato skins came out which were extremely crispy and tasted like processed cheese. After we ate them another 30mins passed before our food had come out. At this time we still had no silverware. My wife got the prime rib sandwich where the bread was completely burnt and I ordered your double stack smokehouse burger which had no sausage, the reason I ordered it and was mediocre at best. We didn't bother telling him since he hardly came by and seemed annoyed we he did. But the point that bothered me most was when he said he was mad that you were giving free meals to veteran . He also unprofessionally complained that these veterans only left him a couple of dollar each as a tip. This display of ungrateful disregard for our service men and women who have fought for his freedom was the real tipping point of this meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-port-charlotte?start=20,,,,,
0,Kimberly N.,"Port Charlotte, FL",7,13,,1.0,2016-01-08,"Don't waste your money.  Or risk your stomach! We stopped for a quick bite mid shopping and wow, I wish we hadn't.  We ordered the mozzarella sticks, which were fine, but seriously no better than what I could microwave at home.  Then we ordered the sizzling shrimp and chicken and a burger.  The burger was overcooked and very thin--think slightly dressed up McD's burger--but edible.  The sizzling shrimp and chicken was not appetizing.  But I was starving, so I tried.  The shrimp had not been de-tailed, which is a problem when covered in a goopy sauce.  As I kept crunching on tails, I gave up.  So I tried the chicken, which had the look of something you would find in a school cafeteria (preformed wedges that did not resemble chicken breasts).  I should not have tried the chicken.  I pushed the plate away and 10 minutes later was in the bathroom (thankfully close by) saying goodbye to everything in my stomach.   The waitress did take my meal off the tab, but seriously, go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-port-charlotte?start=20,,,,,
23,Avery S.,"Punta Gorda, FL",0,7,,1.0,2016-01-23,Came in and sat at the bar. Waited ten minutes for the bar tender to acknowledge me. Never did. I left to find some where else to have dinner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-port-charlotte,,,,,
21,Tom S.,"Punta Gorda, FL",1,1,,4.0,2016-02-27,"The steak and ribs were pretty good, but the parmesan steak fries were worth the trip by themselves. The service was excellent as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-port-charlotte,,,,,
20,F K.,"Punta Gorda, FL",0,16,2.0,2.0,2016-03-12,"The service in the bar area is terrible every time I am here. It is not even busy. The bartenders are not attentive at all. Food is good, but bar service sucks. I think a management change is needed here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-port-charlotte,,,,,
14,Danielle D.,"Bradenton, FL",131,411,96.0,3.0,2016-07-04,"Was not as bad as all the reviews stated. It was typical fridays food. Their pretzels and beer cheese are awesome. They brought out the wrong boneless wings for me, but they let me keep the wrong ones, then brought out fresh classic wings. Service was solid too. Would come back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-port-charlotte,,,,,
18,Clinton R.,"Punta Gorda, FL",8,2,,1.0,2017-01-11,"My family and I went to this exact TGI for my fiances 21st birthday, and seeing that TGI is our restaurant of choice we thought this would be a great time all of us. Needless to say by this rating we were wrong. Our server was extremely short with us and showed us very little attention. We are stripes rewards memebers and made this known at the start of or visit, yet we never recieved our complementary chips which she did put on our ticket at the end so she just simply did not give them to us. My fiance and I found the strawberry passion fruit teas to be not as sweet as we remember so we asked her for sweetener to put in it, yet she asked us 3 times if we would just prefer sweet tea instead of sweetner though we asked for the sweetner specifically and every time we refilled she continued to ask us this question. When we were finished with the meal we reminded her it was my fiancees birthday, knowing from past visits and from the TGI rewards app that you receive a free desert on birthdays, yet our waitress insisted that we did not get a free desert and did not give us one. In finality, when we paid the ticket at the end of this train wreck of a birthday celebration, when she brought us our change she instead of keeping confidentiality and kindness in treatment of our change instead she openly carried the cash and threw it grandiously onto our table announcing ""here is your change."" and left without a good bye or have a nice night. We are all in agreement that this was hands down some of the worst service of out lives, and i am sad to say that TGI is being cut ouf of our restaurant eating experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-port-charlotte,,,,,
9,Catherine V.,"North Port, FL",1,9,11.0,5.0,2017-02-17,"I've been coming here for years... and since the new ownership and new menus, Friday's has me coming back at least once a week!  Food: incredible! However I'm one of those that sticks with what I like... I always order the salmon with lobster bisque ... phenomenal! Service: like I said I've been coming here for a while now and the staff remember everyone! I typically sit at the bar to eat.. it's easier than waiting for a table... the staff is incredible, all so welcoming, friendly, you get to feeling like long lost family after a while ..  Overall: hands down my favorite place to go for service and food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-port-charlotte,,,,,
15,John B.,"Port Charlotte, FL",24,1,,1.0,2017-02-27,"Usually we go to Chili's but we ( family of four ) decided to try Fridays even though we knew there was a reason we haven't been in a while. All I can say is just do not go if you want Good Service. The food is great. That I can not complain about. Steaks and burgers on point. The waitress messed up every bar drink. I had to eventually just grab my own drinks from the bar to ensure they were correct. Waitress asked short or tall glass if you asked for short she gave you tall. You wanted it chilled she orderd it on the rocks. It was like she was SABOTAGING the establshment. Moving on... They gave our food to the wrong table that sat down after us lol now this is getting bad. So they have to correct their food and we have been waiting about an hour with 2 kids and now have to wait for it to be remade (no mention from the wait staff, we just happened to hear the conversation, no apology for the long wait either).  Mind you that is not what they ordered so they ask for the manager. (I assume they had more issues) after all that we paid for the bill and asked for change to even give a tip that she did not deserve. She pocketed or doesn't know how to count 5.00 of the change she owed back.. What in the hell is wrong with this place or woman? I did bring it up to the manager and asked for nothing in return and lol got nothing. Food was fine. The waitress name is Delilah. Stay Away.

10,Lisa M.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",2,4,11.0,1.0,2017-02-28,I ordered chicken bruschetta pasta as a to go order. I love Friday's and when I travel for work will often eat there but this time there was a chunk of ceramic glass in with the noodles and tomatoes.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-port-charlotte,,,,,
12,Ken O.,"Punta Gorda, FL",0,7,,1.0,2017-04-08,We ate at the bar. One bartender completely ignored us even after eye contact. I guess they don't work as a team. Bar left completely unattended for almost 5 min. Only the hostess was kind and polite. No sign of management anywhere. This is our 2nd visit in the last two months and we received the same poor quality of service. Kudos to the kitchen because the food was excellent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-port-charlotte,,,,,

11,Chris T.,"Port Charlotte, FL",0,1,,1.0,2017-10-20,"By far this is the worst Fridays I have ever been to my wife and I have tried to eat here several time and every time it is a horrible experience. When we come in we are told it is a 10 minuet wait and when you look around there are more then 10 open booths and no one waiting. I asked why is there a wait and the hostess replied "" the servers are backed up and we can seat anymore until they catch up."" Seriously that was her answer this time we came for endless apps and when we asked for the endless app menu the host told us that it was now $15 and tried to convince us they were not worth it. After waiting 15 mins to be sat we then had to wait 15 mins for our server. Finally our food came out pice by pice. And it was horrible. This is the worst Fridays to dine at.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-port-charlotte,,,,,
8,Katalina Q.,"Punta Gorda, FL",729,288,626.0,1.0,2017-11-14,"Boy was waaay to stressed to be trying to wait on veterans who served our country. With the older ones he was curt, impatient, threw out sideway glances and did a fabulous eyeroll. Jittery, indecisive, with arm or leg always jiggling...he had no patience. Don't eat at the bar if he's working. He told several customers he was overworked and understaffed and they'd just have to wait and be patient. I personally watched this act for over 2 hours. When we paid our bill he grabbed our cash and NEVER returned with our change. I got a good laugh out of it and told my other...best to just walk away and let him steal his tip and we'd never return. So it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-port-charlotte,,,,,
7,Linda M.,"Port Charlotte, FL",0,20,,2.0,2017-12-12,"This place has gone steadily downhill for at least three years. The menu is limited. There is never enough staff, yet the place is usually empty. The bartenders seem okay. But the Endless Aps are now $15.00. Almost nine bucks for a Jack and Diet? It's overpriced on everything.  I used to get fajitas. Even BLTs. Forget it now! It's not the happening chain it used to be. Even the atmosphere seems gloomy somehow.  I'll put it this way. For two drinks and two Aps to go, I paid $40.00 Enough said. Time to find a new place to be thankful in. For that price I can buy a bottle of Jack and watch some Netflix. Very disappointing.  Also, a lot of the old staff is gone. They were fun! Why such turnover? Maybe you'll have better luck. But I'd go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-port-charlotte,,,,,
6,Dave H.,"North Port, FL",0,30,1.0,2.0,2017-12-30,"Tried this restaurant on a 2 for 1 coupon from the Stone Crabs. First, the restaurant has a ""city neighborhood bar"" type of feel, which is not my favorite theme. The industrial looking tile floor gave me the impression that it was dirty, although it probably wasn't.  We apparently were the only table in the area of the restaurant for our waiter, as it took over 10 minutes for him to get to us - only after we asked the waitress who was serving the rest of the tables - who we had. The food was, we thought, a little too pricey for what was served. It was difficult for both my wife and I to find items that we wanted to try. My $15 dinner didn't come with a salad or bread. A negative in my mind, and the soup substitute I requested for the potatoes side dish, was a $2 up charge (not worth the money in my mind after tasting the soup). My wife wound up ordering a burger which she did say was above average. Generally in our opinion, the food wasn't worth the price. There are better choices for the $40 that it would've cost us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-port-charlotte,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
