6,Dimitri B.,"Prague, Czech Republic",1,3,,3.0,2014-07-03,"General american style steak restaurant. Tried steaks and burgers. Portions came relatively quickly. Staff were friendly. If you want to dine in peace, you could find another place since you will find yourself in noisy restaraunt an since it's  combined with a bar. Despite noise, great place to eat!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-praha-2,,,,,
5,Kirstin P.,"Prague, Czech Republic",15,115,62.0,4.0,2014-07-27,"Part of a chain of American restaurants.  If you want to feel like you are in the US, this is the place to be. Traditional American Bar food, burgers, fries and beer.  Large nonsmoking section, but nothing separating that section from the smokers. Wednesday night is ladies night, buy one get one free all night.  Super child friendly- high chairs with safety belts, changing tables and blooms for the kids. I really want to give this place 5 stars for trying so hard, but the server we had was clearly in the wrong industry.  We had to remind him for everything we ordered, tell him multiple times in Czech and English before he understood, and I was with native speakers. But he tried hard, which was appreciated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-praha-2,,,,,
2,Sarianne S.,"Copenhagen, Denmark",82,89,329.0,4.0,2015-04-08,"Guaranteed good honest American food and great service; everything you need to happily fill your belly. Burgers, steaks, salmon, fajitas, salads..the menu is full of delicious options. The sweet Jack Daniel's sauce seems to be just perfect with anything you serve it with, so I really recommend to try one of the meat, chicken or salmon dishes that comes with this signature sauce.  TGIs serves a great variety of yummy cocktails, so this place is perfect for after work or weekend drinks. It does get pretty crowded during the weekend so might be worth making a reservation. Besides the busy and slightly noisy environment the only negative part for me is that the smoking side of the restaurant is not separated in any way so even in the non-smoking area you can expect a bit of smoke. Otherwise a safe option when you want a proper American meal or nice relaxed atmosphere for cocktails!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-praha-2,,,,,
4,Petr V.,"Prague, Czech Republic",7,6,,4.0,2015-12-15,"Everything you expect from TGI.. The general sense of US style dining and stuff that could teach Czeck waiters a trick or two.. For Prague it is a bit pricey and there are certainly better places to get a burger, but if you want to feel like in the US and do not want to risk anything.. It is definately a way to go.. Oh and the guy who thought of wrapping baby back rips in bacon crust should get a medal..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-praha-2,,,,,
3,Mads W.,"Rønne, Denmark",14,19,1.0,2.0,2016-03-20,"Can in for a quick dinner before going to the cinema. Waiting staff was prompt and effective and spoke excellent English. Food was however a great disappointment. We had taco's, quesadilla and mediterranean salad. The salad was fine, fresh and crisp, but the quesadillas were soft, lukewarm and the cheese inside wasn't melted. Further they were quite bland - no chili and no trace of cilantro. The tacos weren't tacos. Instead they had used small flour tortillas, which weren't crisp at all. Huge mistake. If you are running a concept restaurant, then for gods sake stick to the concept, so customers know what they can expect. After all it's a very limited menu, so it should be a manageable task to train the kitchen chimpanse to make the dishes correctly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-praha-2,,,,,
1,Heather R.,"Sherwood, OR",39,90,23.0,3.0,2016-11-14,"A morning after a night out.... TGI Fridays was a night ""taste of home."" Unfortunately, the service was mediocre (not awful, not great,) and the fries we highly OVER seasoned. Otherwise, the chicken fingers were nommy & hot, and the scenery was GORGEOUS.... Prague is beautiful!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-praha-2,,,,,
