10,Natalia D.,"Prague, Czech Republic",90,176,,4.0,2014-02-15,"Pretty touristy and overpriced place, but let's not forget that they pay the rent for Na Prikope street location, and the food and service are usually (with a small exception) almost worth the price. The portions are big, the meals are tasty and heavy if we talk about steaks, sandwiches and burgers, but all of good quality and properly cooked. The waiters are very polite and cheerful, which is typical for any T.G.I.F's, though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-praha,,,,,
7,Marita G.,"Prague, Czech Republic",18,11,23.0,4.0,2014-05-27,"Ooookay, food is good, prices are high in comparison to most of the restaurants in Prague. I like mashed potatoes there, because they add cheese and  mushrooms to it. Also TGI may be the only place in the city offering Cherry Coke. Steaks are amazing! This is the restaurant that you can go with your family to. Staff is usually friendly, but once the worker attacked my friends and me, because 3 of us were waiting for 2 others to finish their meal. It was very rude, so we decided to call the manager, BUT the manager appeared to be one that shouted at us :)  As I am the frequent visitor of TGI, I think this kind of behavior ruins the relationship with the customers :) So, hope someone will read it and take actions in order the place to get the fifth star from clients like me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-praha,,,,,
8,Stuart B.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",27,6,222.0,4.0,2014-05-30,"First time i've been in a TGI Fridays, suppose it's alright, handy for WiFi (The Clash has just come on over the speakers ... There's an extra star right there.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-praha,,,,,
5,Jen S.,"Las Vegas, NV",235,447,661.0,3.0,2014-10-10,"I know, I did it again. Went to a TGI Fridays outside of the USA except  this time I was pleasently surprised by it. The staff was nothing but friendly and bilingual. Unsure if this is because it is an 'American' chain but pleasent none the less! We were greeted right away, allowed to sit wherever we wanted, we decided to sit inside, and right away were given menus .  Not even a few minutes later our server came over and was also very friendly and even had some laughs with us, a rarity here in prague with service staff.   As for the food, it was very typical of the US style menu and quality. Just average. Chicken fingers and fries, to burgers, okay steaks and good mashed potatoes.  If I am rating Fridays just off there food, it would be a 2. This food is not awesome and should be skipped if you have better food options, and in Prague you most surely do. The prices are also very high for Prague, and for the portions not worth it.  Otherwise my overall experience here was positive, but very similar to the US, and in the US I wouldn't go here to eat either..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-praha,,,,,
3,Lykourgos S.,"Copenhagen, Denmark",88,162,121.0,3.0,2015-02-28,"Best Fridays I've been, but doesn't worth the money in Prague.  The staff was amazing. They were moving like electrons around the restaurant and never waited longer than a minute to get their help.  The food was of good quality materials, but averagely cook. For example, two burgers on the table had different temperature!  Wi fi is handy and I liked that the music was not loud as in other TGI's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-praha,,,,,
0,Sarianne S.,"Copenhagen, Denmark",82,89,329.0,4.0,2015-07-12,"Guaranteed good honest American food and great service; everything you need to happily fill your belly. Burgers, steaks, salmon, fajitas, salads...the menu is full of delicious options. The sweet Jack Daniel's seems to be just perfect with anything you serve it with, so I really recommend to try one of the meat, chicken or salmon dishes that comes with this signature sauce.  TGI's serves a great variety of yummy cocktails, so this place is perfect for after-work or weekend drinks. During the summer the terrace outside is great for enjoying refreshments if you don't mind the tourist herds passing by on Na Příkopě street. The terrace closes at midnight after which you can move indoors.  TGI's is a safe option when you want a proper American meal or a nice relaxed atmosphere for sipping cocktails!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-praha,,,,,
6,Debi L.,"VALLEY VILLAGE, CA",1,16,2.0,3.0,2015-11-06,The staff was nice but the food is just okay and it's expensive by prague standards. A beef fajita was 550 crown which is over $20! The iced tea was $3 and there are no free refills.  The tiny kids grilled chicken was overcooked. The kids meal does not come with a drink.  Won't be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-praha,,,,,
2,Martin B.,"Berlin, Germany",43,23,16.0,5.0,2015-11-15,"Clean, great service & good food. I can recommend the Jack Daniels Burger. Great stuff!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-praha,,,,,

1,Xman G.,"Fontana, CA",1,8,5.0,4.0,2016-12-31,"Came here for drinks on new years eve, bartenders were polite and made a killer cocktail. Beer was also on point. Good service and would probably be back sometime. Only thing was their buffalo wings were a little too salty for my liking but other than that it was a pleasant expierence",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-praha,,,,,
