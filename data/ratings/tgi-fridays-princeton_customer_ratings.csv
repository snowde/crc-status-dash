Nothing is overpriced and nothing is spectacular--except the Classic Wedge Salad. I find that in the past decade the quality of TGIF has really gone down hill.

Each of the entrees came out individually about 10 minutes apart - so much for eatting together as a family. The list goes on and on.

During happy hour the drinks are cheap, the food is cheap, and I've only had one bad experience there. There must have been someone new in the kitchen because everything was coming out raw or undercooked, etc.  They must have fired whoever that was because everything was back to normal the next week.  The drinks are cheap, too, and they make them a decent size.  I compare every drink to how I get it at Fridays and if another restaurant is stingy, I complain to my husband that next week, we're going back to TGIF so I can get a decent sized drink!

When I went in to dine with my daughter (the card was a gift for her), we first asked to have the balance on the card checked because we'd just realized on the way to the restaurant that the card we had said $50 when I'd requested a $20 card (I paid with $20 cash just 5 days ago at the same location). When the waiter checked the balance, the card came up as inactive, so we were flippantly told it was unusable and there was nothing they could do for me...  When I asked to speak to the manager, the manager made no inclination to find out what had happened, contact the bartender who sold me the card or review transactions from the date and time of purchase, instead telling me there was no way to prove my word was true and assuming I was lying! No apologies were made and fault was clearly assumed to be mine. The manager said he wouldn't contact the bartender because it would be ""their word versus yours (mine)""!  Now why in the world, if I were going to try to cheat the place out of a meal, would I insist the card had less than the face value and tell the manager the day and time that I made the purchase, even suggesting he contact the bartender on staff that day?!?

The mozzarella sticks new recipe was fabulous - it has that super soft melts in your mouth type of cheese that is rare in most mozzarella sticks (I've only encountered it a few times in my life - and it's my favorite!). The potato skins were also pretty good with big chunks of bacon bits and cheddar cheese. The BBQ chicken wings were pretty average though.  I ordered the chipotle chicken and shrimp noodle dish for the first time, and I had high hopes for it. It has a creamy fettuccini like sauce with chipotle spiciness to it - however, my dish came out SUPER spicey, tooooooo spicey for me.... Unless you like that sort of thing. I wasn't a fan - I started breaking out a sweat after a couple bites. Sadly, I ended up refusing it completely, but luckily they my waiter asked his boss if I could delete it off the bill because I hated it. It was gross. The sauce was weird and too spicey.  I had to chug my whole iced tea to chase the spice and even then on the drive home my mouth was still burning a bit.  Ryan seemed to really enjoy his ribs and steak meal though.

To my surprise thee were 5 customers at the bar and 1 idle bartender. We had our choice of tables and were immediately seated. This was great for us but disastrous for a Friday nights revenue. As a customer my advice to the corporate office would be to make an unannounced visit on a Friday night to this unit as and see if you can come up with new ideas to take on the competition. Unless the accounting staff has already decided to roll over and use this unit as a tax loss.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-princeton?start=20,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.512,2.0

It did not seem very busy in the area we sat. There were two waitresses in our section. Immediately, we were helped and asked for our drinks and the. We ordered our appetizers and lunch. A good start. However, it went downhill from there. We waited 50 minutes for our appetizers, impossible to find our waitress at the 35 minute mark...about 40 minutes in, we asked her where they were and she said that they were ""slammed"" and it was unusually busy. The tables around us were empty. Three parties came in about then, at the forty minute mark sat down tables near us. They literally got their orders by the time we had finished our appetizers (15 minutes or less). After finishing our appetizers, we waited another 20 minutes for refills and for our main meals. I had the kids pack up the good because their sister and her friend had gone to Bobby Burgers and were done before we got our appetizers and I didn't want them to wait any longer... They had been waiting 30-40 minutes already. The food was good as always Very disappointing.

But whatever, they came out cold and in tall glasses.  We ordered two half racks of ribs and an appetizer sampler...over 20 minutes later we were wondering where our food was and asked our server. Of course, he realized shortly thereafter that he forgot to fire our order in the computer. Ugh. Well, as a server myself I can't say that some version of this hasn't happened to me while I was on the job, but I at least send the manager over if there are any sort of issues with a table. Not our server!  Though the food came out pretty quickly after that it didn't come out all together, and my food (the apps) of course took longer and THEN he told me they were out of mozzarella sticks! Not like I needed them anyway and I didn't make a big deal about it at the time but jeez...not a lot of communication between the servers and kitchen at this place! After all this not even a small discount on the check, just a few extra rewards points for my dad that made him feel special but really aren't worth anything.  Server was nice enough but he could have handled the situation better, in my opinion.  Food was solidly average.  Slow bar.

Please do not visit this location unless you want to wait 3 hours and still non of your food it right or hot if even actually arrives at your table. We arrived with 12 guest was only given one waiter until after 2 hours we asked to speak to the manager because non of our food was correct. In a party there was one pregnant women and a 7 year old. Her food came out ice cold and my nephews food was not right when the first brought it to the table. He ordered a simple grilled chicken sandwich off the kids menu the brought him fried chicken nuts. We sent it back 2 hours later after we asked to speak to again since the server never came back to give us an update. They brought my nephews food out in a to-go container since we could wait any longer we had to find another place to eat. I haven't had terrible service like this ever!! It wasn't like we were ordering something hard. Majority of out tables got burgers.... we had 4 bottle of ketchup on the table and every single bottle was empty. I order a medium jack Daniel's burger and it came out blacker then the shirt I had on and the waiter tried to convince me that was medium. After we asked another table if we could use their ketchup we were able to squeeze out able a teaspoon of ketchup so I asked him he could fill the bottle. He came back back with a bottle but guess what.... I still didn't have a burger!!! I could go on and on of how terrible this service is but I will close with this. I was visiting family from Texas so I don't have to ever visit this place again but I got back to my sister n laws and told her about the service not telling the location of the restaurant. She says on the TGIFridays in the marketfair.... oh yeah they are horrible. So this is obviously not the first this horrible service is a thing at this location.

The peach drinks were supposed to have one free refill which were never offered even though they had been empty since the appetizer portion of the meal. The desserts came out but one never arrived and we yet again had to flag the hostess to get our waitress who blamed the kitchen.  We then received our check after waiting for another ten minutes.

The bartender did apologize and I don't seek to have this post retaliate against the man. Poor service became the topic amongst strangers at the bar as every customer present was dissatisfied. If the kitchen were not backed up and messing up orders the bartender would have more time to perform his job. My only two thoughts remaining are 1.

(plus, i dont think i'd go to Seasons52 in sweatpants, and everything else required going outside in the cold. anndddd also, jack daniel's chicken strips and the jd chicken sammich are total guilty pleasures of mine). - walked into the resto, waited awkwardly by the empty hostess stand. - about 4 or 5 people were seated in the bar area, and there was 1 family seated at a table in the dining room - hostess appeared, muttered a lifeless greeting, and sat us right next to the other table of diners - it was dark, desolate, and cold. the table next to us were eating in winter coats. - no waitress came by to take a drink order or greet us.  - over 20 minutes later, we walked out seriously, a pathetic experience- such a waste of time. in a super busy joint, this might have been forgivable... but in a resto with 2 tables of diners, totally unacceptable. no way was i about to put out $$ for the crappy food that likely would've made it outta the kitchen 2 hours later.  oh, and shoutout to the hostess that kept looking over at us, with our menus shut, and didnt make a single move to get a waitress or apologize for the wait. or to apologize when we told her we were leaving. nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-princeton,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002
