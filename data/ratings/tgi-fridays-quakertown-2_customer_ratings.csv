30,Jodie R.,"Hatfield, PA",14,20,8.0,3.0,2013-03-23,Don't get the bleu cheese and bacon steak. Awful. Overkill on the cheese(and not good flavor) and just not a good steak. We didn't eat it and for the first time ever had entrees taken off the check. The husband and I both got it because it sounded so good and we both love bleu cheese steaks/burgers. It just wasn't good at all. The shrimp scampi we got with it was very good though as well as the tomato mozzarella salad. Our server was great. Think his name was Romi. The manager that came to our table was also great. I want to give it 4 stars but the steak was just too bad ( and they sent out the wrong steaks at first too).,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-quakertown-2?start=20,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252
36,Ed M.,"Coopersburg, PA",0,20,,2.0,2013-05-20,"We came to TGIF Mid-afternoon. The place was relatively empty. The door was broken and blocked requiring going to the one on the other side of the main entry. The greeter was polite and took us to our table. Oliver would be our server she said. We did see Oliver at a distant table, but alas never at ours. He did appear in our aisle to serve people who were seated a couple of tables away aftervwe were seated. After about 10 minutes of no Oliver, I flagged a waitress to ask for a server. She said Oliver would be with us soon. She then took our order for drinks noting that this was not her table. One more try to get Oliver-- no sucess. She then said she would take our order. A couple of minutes later she came back and said she would be our server. Apparently Oliver was overwhelmed trying to take care of 2 tables and one that asked a couple of times for the check. The ribs were OK but much worse than the ribs I had here a couple of months ago. Price was much higher. My wife had a hamburger that was Ok,but the fries were cold obviously made quite some time ago. Overall, the place was becoming dated, the food overpriced. If it weren't for our new server, one star would have been too much. The main office should review training and management or just let it fail. They lost a customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-quakertown-2?start=20,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088

The food is passable but I'm still not going say it is good.

35,Bret C.,"Sumneytown, PA",1,94,,2.0,2013-11-01,"Two of us had dinner here after a movie.  Because it was Halloween night it wasn't very busy, and just two (well behaved) children! We were promptly seated by a most pleasant hostess. Jefferson, our server, soon arived with the menus (three: beverages, appetizers, dinner) and told how happy he was that we were there on a Thursday night because of all of the specials that were available.  Let it be said up front that he was the highlight of our visit.  He was professional yet especially personable.  When we were unsure about what to order he patiently descibed our different options and checked back often to inquire about how we were enjoying them. The margarita ""Thursday Night Specials"" were quite good, plentiful, and a bargain.  The naco appetizer consisted of  eight nicely seasoned and baked nachos accompanied by three different sauces, enough for two to share.  The Friday's Shrimp was okay.  There were some heavily battered small shrimp mixed in with decent french fries, not the best presentation we have experienced.  The glazed salmon entree was good, topped with a nice citrus slaw with a side of steamed broccolli which was somewhat off-tasting.  The salmon piece was quite small and a little on the dry side but tasty.  The chocolate peanut butter pie was scrumptous and decadent.  For an off night, even though we were not in a hurry, we thought that the food came out a little slow.  Yet Jefferson seemed geninely interested that we have a good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-quakertown-2?start=20,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12
