1,Simon L.,"Bracknell, United Kingdom",8,90,324.0,1.0,2016-01-01,"Thought that I would take the kids here over the Christmas period for lunch. I kinda new what to expect so was not expecting too much but it is what it is. We started with the Times Square Player which consisted of Chicken wings, potato skins and motzrella  sticks. This was ok. For the main course my nine year old had a hot dog with fries( boring and plain) which she only ate the chips. I had one of the Tostada stacks which is Cajun chicken, hot sauce and onions and fried veg between layers of tortilla. The wife and other son went for a Jack Daniels chicken burger.  The Tostada was really bland, tortillas were over cooked and it tasted like eating cardboard and left over veg sprayed with a cheap hot sauce. The burgers were dry, too much sauce on and served in a sugary roll. All in all really disappointed with the food and won't ever spend my money there again,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-reading-2,,,,,
