15,Rose L.,"Petaluma, CA",35,618,325.0,1.0,2012-08-21,We waited over 30 minutes for seating when we were told 10-20 minutes.  We finally got seated and were ready to order.  Took over 30 minutes for appetizers.  Then even longer for entrees.  Had we not ordered appetizers we would not be well. Total dining experience started at 7:15 and ended at 9:15.  That was way too long waiting for food. We had to ask for refills etc.  so service was amiss and there were not that many people left after we got seated so but not sure what is up with the kitchen.  They should have been able to get the good out faster to get diners out but for whatever reason they cannot make it work.  Our server did his best but this was not a good dining experience with kids complaining about hunger from waiting for food to come.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rehoboth-beach,,,,,
2,Brian K.,"North East, MD",4,9,,2.0,2012-09-07,Service was great. As far as the food well the fries were ok. Oh yeah my 5 year old liked the Mac&Cheese. Looking back I should have ordered off this kids menu.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rehoboth-beach?start=20,,,,,
21,Sheri A.,"Rehoboth Beach, DE",11,15,,3.0,2013-04-30,"I am a transplant to Rehoboth from the DC area and TGIF was a favorite lunch hangout of mine when I was still living there so I do like to stop in to the Rehoboth TGIFridays for lunch now and then. Food-wise, I am pretty happy with the place. I don't order a WIDE variety of stuff from their menu as I have my favorites and usually order them, and then try a couple new things when they add new stuff to the menu. I generally get sandwiches, salads or appetizers at lunch, so I can't speak to the more ""main meal"" offerings. I was recently in twice--once alone, once with a friend--and had two relatively new menu items off the appetizer or ""share"" (a sort of tapas) menu. I really enjoyed the chicken skewers that had a soy-type caramelization on them. Salty, but delicious. I also tried the Thai pork tacos, which are almost ridiculously tiny but tasty. I had issues with finding pork in one of them but they were otherwise good. I don't generally have much of a problem with service at this location. What I HAVE had a substantial problem with is judgemental, hauty/snotty hosts/hostesses. This was not a problem on my 2 recent visits, but I had completely stopped going there for some months due to a particular young snotty host who treated me like dirt because I came in for lunch alone and deigned to request a booth, even when I came in right at the start of lunch service and the restaurant was EMPTY! He actually as much as told me that I wasn't worthy of a booth. I am very short and have arthritis. I ask for a booth everywhere I go because most of the chairs at the tables in restaurants are excrutiatingly uncomfortable for me. This should not be a problem as long as I'm getting there when there are no or few other patrons in the restaurant. When I lived in the DC area, there were 2 restaurants I stopped going to because of the snotty attitude toward my dining alone, whether I asked for a booth or not. Restaurants need to understand that my money is just as good as the next customers and I have a right to be served with dignity and respect!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rehoboth-beach,,,,,
0,Marc M.,"Millsboro, DE",0,28,,1.0,2014-06-09,"TGI Friday's worst location.   First, the service is terrible.  And if you can't cook a prepackaged burger than why are you even in business. The Rehoboth location has one more problem, and it is how they do business.  First, they are always out of whatever promotional item that seems to have the lowest profit margin.. And they bury some of the national promotions in the book on the table and they are absent from the large menu.   I get it, you want the tourist area bar crowd and not people coming in to eat. I rarely eat here, like 3 times in 7 years.  And by the looks of the empty tables I am not the only person who avoids the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rehoboth-beach?start=20,,,,,
20,Craig K.,"Philadelphia, PA",36,13,2.0,1.0,2014-07-18,"This was one of the most disappointing experiences ever. I have been to Fridays plenty of times and in multiple locations with great food.  Granted, we did have a party of 7 however it was at 4 in the afternoon before the place was busy.  The bartender was slow... The wait staff was slow...  Wrong food was brought out...The food quality everyone ordered was so disgusting it could have been placed in a trough and given to livestock or pigs.  I would not recommend this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rehoboth-beach,,,,,
22,Kristin M.,"Randolph, NJ",1,11,1.0,1.0,2014-08-26,Food was ok for TGI's. Service was horrifically slow. And the staff didn't seem to notice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rehoboth-beach,,,,,
19,Thomas G.,"Rehoboth Beach, DE",0,1,,1.0,2014-10-26,"Came in late on a Thursday night (my first and last time visiting, 10/23/14) and learned about the $3 drink special at the bar. I ordered a Long Island and paid with a $20 bill, but received $16.50 back. When I asked why I was short changed the male bartender repeatedly and aggressively asked if I'd like to speak to the manager about it. All I could do was raise my eyebrow in utter confusion. Essentially I came in, sat down and began watching television and ordered my drink. I hadn't even yet spoken to anyone else at the bar. The female bartender working saw the situation as it occurred, consulted with him briefly in private, took the 50¢ I had left on the bar, corrected his idiocy, and gave me correct change.  I still cannot comprehend what he was trying to accomplish other than ensure that he'd receive no tip. I explained that it's not even about the money, it's the principle of what he did that is the problem. As I left, I pointed at him and flipped him a middle finger. He called out from behind the bar, ""Yeah, see you next week!"" I'm not sure what he was basing that off of, because again this was my first time visiting this location, and unfortunately for the business as a whole I will not be returning. There are plenty of other places nearby where you can receive better service, better drinks, and better food. I suggest crossing the street in either direction to either Fin's across the highway, or Big Chill just further down (toward the beach on the same side). Since he was so insistent on getting the manager involved, I went ahead and sent a message via the website for the Rehoboth location explaining the situation as I did here, but have yet to receive a response. Apparently this location is willing to give up potential returning customers on the whims of their emotional, childlike staff, even during the off season. Save your time and money and go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rehoboth-beach,,,,,
16,Steven H.,"Dagsboro, DE",0,12,1.0,1.0,2015-02-28,"My wife & I took our children & my parents to TGIF in Rehoboth De. We stood around for approximately 30 min & our waitress Michelle took our order for drinks and never brought them until our food come. She then asked if we still wanted the appetizer? I replied, ""I don't think it's necessary now."" We had a hard time finishing our dinner cuz she seemed to wait on everyone but us & hardly filled our drinks. I was still hungry after eating my meal & my father was so hungry that he ordered another meal. My mother was embarrassed that he ordered more food but he was still hungry & I was too so he gave me some of his fries. Not happy what so ever....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rehoboth-beach,,,,,

14,Sheelah N.,"Salisbury, MD",5,98,67.0,3.0,2015-08-02,"This us one of my favorite restaurant chains to dine and I've been to this location a few times.  The food was predictably good but we defining felt short changed. We each got a plate of the jack Daniels sesame strips ( my fave ) and I swear it didn't even cover 1/2 the plate.  If these apps are to be large enough to share, it wasn't happening with that plate.   Our server was nice enough, but service was so slow. ( Tuesday afternoon rush? )  just meh.  It's a good thing I like the chain as a whole, because if this were my 1st experience, I'd never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rehoboth-beach,,,,,

13,Annie N.,"Herndon, VA",42,13,,1.0,2016-08-26,Not only did our server get our order wrong. She accused us of ordering the food wrong not that she took the order wrong. No refills on our water and we ate different times because the food came separately. Slow service on top of it all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rehoboth-beach,,,,,
12,Jessie S.,"West Orange, NJ",6,42,5.0,2.0,2016-09-05,"Bad.  Slow service even when nearly empty! Awful Cobb salad but when I told our waitress that the avocado was inedible bc it was rock hard and that the bacon was fatty and cold and limp, they comped the salad.  On the plus side, my husband said his burger was really good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rehoboth-beach,,,,,

8,Nicole B.,"Newark, DE",19,453,331.0,2.0,2016-11-15,We came here for happy hour this past Friday since it was close and had some good specials.  The bartender was pleasant although some of the people in the bar area were loud and rude.  We ordered the Jack Daniels boneless wings.  There was no sauce on them and they came out cold. The steamed shrimp were pretty good but could have been cooked a tad longer. The pot stickers which we have had in the past and loved tasted like they were thrown in the microwave without being cooked first so the outside was hard and falling apart and these were also not very hot.  We tried the fish sliders for the first time and these were a 5 star hit!  Cooked perfectly and hot with pickles and tartar sauce.   I just wish the rest had been as good as the sliders.  We will try them again since I have had wings and pot stickers that were good but only because it's continently located.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rehoboth-beach,,,,,

I had a challenge with trying to redeem a rewards coupon but the waitress checked into it and sorted it out, so we were able to use.  The bar area is usually loud, which is to be expected, so we sat on the dining room side and that worked out well. A bacon cheeseburger, strawberry salad & salad with grilled chicken were order~all of us were happy with the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rehoboth-beach,,,,,
7,Mr. R.,"Stamford, CT",1,11,3.0,1.0,2017-07-06,Food was horrible to say the least. Had a black bean burger that was so over cooled my knife could not cut through. Fries were cooked in old oil and were cold( imean come on they couldn't even send out fresh fries) my friend ordered guacamole with his nachos. They didn't tell him they were out of gauc until they brought his app out. My brother had burger that had hair in it (disgusting)! They manager didn't even come to apologize for all the complaints we had. While they mady brother a new burger they didn't even comp him for the meal. I know it's a chain restaurant but this establishment is way below average.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rehoboth-beach,,,,,

4,Philip R.,"Ambler, PA",50,208,900.0,5.0,2017-10-18,Driving by and saw add for Raw Bar Happy Hour and change my plans to go elsewhere. When I arrived I also saw an early bird special (4-7) for steak and lobster for $14.99.  Happy hour in the bar atc $3 selected martinis on Wednesday.   The 1/2 lb shrimp waa good and really enjoyed the steak and lobster.  The steak was perfectly cooked to my liking of medium rare.   They also let me substitute the two sides so I ordered the fried brussel sprouts and sauteed spinach in lieu of what came with it. They were also very good.  Service was great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rehoboth-beach,,,,,
