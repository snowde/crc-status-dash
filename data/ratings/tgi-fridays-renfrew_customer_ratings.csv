2,Gregg J.,"Glasgow City, United Kingdom",4,17,,2.0,2012-05-23,"I'm generally a fan of TGIs. They tend to do what they do well, if a little expensive. So, with that in mind, I visited the TGIs at Braehead. Sunday night, about 18:45 'twas petty busy and we had to wait at the bar for 15 mins or so. Fair enough, we hadn't booked. Anyway, we were given a little ""pager"" that alerts you when a table has been made free, so off it went and we toddled off to our table via the very helpful front-of-house host.  The first thing that struck me was that our table was STICKY... like, really sticky. I put it down to the type of varnish (?) used, and without obviously going around touching other peoples' tables, there's no real way of telling. Either way, I wasn't too impressed with it. So, we ordered around 19:05 (yes, I'm being precise here for reasons that will soon become obvious). My good lady plumped for the ""INFERNO"", I went for the ""MONSTER"" burger. On the menu, both looked awesome and gnarly and all those bodacious overly-American words that I'm pretty sure no-one says. To my supreme disappointment, I was informed some 5 minutes later that they ""had no monster burgers left"". Eh? I thought a monster burger was simply a double-burger, not made of wild boar or something (incidentally, there was wild boar burgers on the menu, I do wonder if they had them that night?!). Anyway, I re-chose and opted for the Jack Daniel's burger.  We then waited. And waited. And waited. And, at 19:55, just as we were about to consider eating the increasingly appetising looking sticky table, they arrived! Two sumptuously glistening, steaming examples of wondrous burgers. Except, they weren't. The bacon on my burger was COLD. Not just luke-warm, but cold to the touch, like it had come directly from a fridge. The cheese on the burger was similarly cold, and looked as though it had melted, then re-set. The burger itself seemed to have retained it's heat, so, the bacon and the majority of the cheese were cast aside, and the burger was then munched without further ceremony. Interestingly, I was also missing the much vaunted slice of tomato. Perhaps they had ran out of those too? Anyhoo, the good lady's burger was similarly lukewarm, but having waited FIFTY minutes for two almost-cold burgers, there seemed little point in complaining (I'm of the school of thought that when something is returned to a kitchen, there tends to be a window of opportunity for ""extras"" to be added (not that I'm accusing anyone of anything here...)). As for the burgers themselves? Yeah, yummy. The INFERNO burger was more of a SMALL PAPER FIRE burger (don't think that would look as good on a menu though), and my Jack Daniels burger did exactly what it said it would (allowing for the AWOL tomato slice). Other criticisms? The music was a touch loud, the menus themselves could do with a wipe clean etc.  So, there you go. A thoroughly disappointing time was had, and I can't see myself going back to this branch any time soon. It's really the combination of all the ""little things"" going wrong (poor stock control, getting the food out asap etc) that let this place down, and that's quite a shame. As secretly, I still like it a bit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-renfrew,,,,,
