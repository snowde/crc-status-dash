The food was awesome- not sure if it was due to 9 hours of shopping and walking at the outlet in 96 degree weather...BUT the menu has changed, more food added, the food was hot fresh and definitely delicious. Yes, it's Friday's but they just bumped ahead of Red Lobster, Applebees, etc,  We've been here twice, and both times..unfortunately the service was too slow. It's not crowded on a Saturday night, so I expect faster service. The waitress was nice though. I'm the type of person who usually finds something wrong, but I have to give Fridays credit this time.

Now, I'm looking for somewhere new.  As for the staff.. Most of them seem clueless and they stand around doing nothing. Service is okay. From a customers point of view, they don't seem like team players.

My friend had mashed potato on the side of her dish. The mashed potatoes belonged to her boyfriend.  The service wasn't that great. We had to ask for refills and one of my friend's cup was sticky.

I wondered why Friday's didn't come up in my yelp search, but now I know. Service here absolutely sucks. The bartender had no personality and pretty much straight faced me the entire time. She asked what I'd like to drink, I asked to look at a menu. As she placed it down she asked again if I'd be drinking... As if I'd somehow viewed the menu before she gave it to us o_O The food was average, Friday's deals and specials are always great. $3 for a miniature plate of sweet potato fries, but I suppose they can charge what they want since it's not on the menu. The drinks were made well and there was a nice blond woman that stopped by after to say hello (maybe a manager?) who was sweet.

A real natural behind the bar.  Food:  I got my food relatively fast  and it was good. Nothing to call home over, but executed really well. Potato skins and Boneless Chicken.  Atmosphere:  I am not a NY, and several places make you feel unwelcome of you aren't. This was not one of those places. Now, a lot could be said for some of the patrons, but the staff was inviting. Not as much conversation with me but she was balancing her time as best as she could with those regulars. Can't blame her, they appear to visit quite a bit!

34,G T.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",55,24,19.0,1.0,2017-05-29,"TGIF at this location didn't open 1/3-1/2 of the available space and artificially created a wait time that I thought was unnecessary. They lost customers from people just leaving to other locations.  Service-was not great as we didn't get knives, forks or plates. I just ate the sampler with my hands until the server came and I asked for 2 dining sets. However, she replied there's a plate under the tissues and wet naps. I continued to eat without knives and forks until she deemed it was necessary and didn't use the plate that she wanted us to share. We just shared from the middle of table. Food- my pics showed how they brought it. Soup looks, taste, and probably is Ragu or Prego? It was also sloppily spooned into the bowl creating a mess in and around the bowl. Bad presentation is ok if the food was good but Ragu isn't appetizing. Sampler was supposed to be Jack Daniels chicken strips, baby back pork ribs, and shrimp. Chicken strips are more like hard day old nuggets or reused chicken, ribs as pics show were slightly raw ( I'm sure that that's not a health hazard), and the shrimp was also quite hard. Main entree of chicken and shrimp alfredo was also very thick and inedible.  Overall I don't think I'll ever step into TGIF. Shelling out $60 dollars should get me better food than the food court at Tangers. However, to be fair, food court food has dramatically improved while the price has remained the same. I hope TGIF changes the quality and service but I probably wouldn't know since this will be my last time going. This is my third bad experience in my last 3 visits at different locations and I refuse to throw more money down the drain from their food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverhead,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92

25,Heather R.,"Center Moriches, NY",27,11,11.0,1.0,2017-08-22,Ordered the Loaded bacon nachos. Togo along with other stuff. Please tell me how this is worth $8.99 doesn't even look like the picture. Had the tiniest bit of toppings and cheese. AND THERE WASNT EVEN BACON ON TGE BACON NACHOS!!!!!!!!Ordered the southern fried chicken sandwich. Had no sauce or pickles on it. They put the avocado on it oooooh boy. But guess they didn't have time to cut the avocado . There was only a few customers in the restaurant when I picked the food up so it wasn't like they were in a rush. Horrible. Waste of money.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverhead,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
20,Nancy W.,"Wading River, NY",7,104,318.0,3.0,2017-08-29,"I have been to this Friday's a number of times and it's always been good but this last visit was kind of disappointing.  The renovations they did are really nice and they are open while they are still finishing up.  Maybe that is the problem or maybe they have a new chef.   We got there for lunch on a weekday and it wasn't crowded.  Our waitress was nice and friendly and we were seated right away.  The service was good but the food was definitely not the way it used to be.  I ordered the new chicken sandwich with avocado and it was so disappointing.   The avocado wasn't sliced properly and it made the entire sandwich soggy, when it was supposed to be crispy.  Maybe they need to put all of the toppings on the side when they serve it because it was apparently sitting back in the kitchen long enough for it to get too soggy to eat.  I had to take it off of the bread and eat it with a fork and knife.  My mom had to send back her french onion soup because it was pretty bad.  It tasted like they put too much corn starch in it because that is all I tasted.  Our waitress was very nice about it and took it off our bill.  The one thing that was the same and has been consistent are their wings.  They are cooked just right and the sauce is really good.  We will be back to check it out again, probably after the renovations are finished and maybe they adjust whatever they are doing in the kitchen.   The Fridays in Selden on North Ocean Avenue at this time is way better, so I think they may all have different owners and managers.  If you are in the Selden area go there, otherwise order the wings in Riverhead and stay away from the french onion soup...for now.  When I go back again I will see if it has improved and give an update.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverhead,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
24,Melissa R.,"Lake Grove, NY",73,79,239.0,2.0,2017-09-15,This is a pretty large Fridays. I was not that thrilled from the beginning. I had a quick lunch break and was pressed for time. I have been to other TGIF's before for lunch so I was confident that I would be ok with time. As soon as I walked in there was no one to sit us down. When he finally walked up he was taking his time. He appeared to be the manager since he was dressed in all black which was different from the wait staff. He gave us an attitude as if we were bothering him. He finally sat us and the waiter was nice but beyond slow. We ordered drinks and meals at the same time to conserve time. We ordered a salad and jack Daniels chicken strip appetizers. This literally took over 35 min to come out. We had to eat so fast then couldn't find waiter to get bill. Once we got the bill he disappeared again and we were now pressed for time. We tried paying our bill at the bar in which the bartender told us she was unable to take payment and would find our waiter. Let me also mention the place was not busy at all. It was a Wednesday afternoon. The food itself was ok. The presentation was sloppy. Definitely will not go here again especially if I am in a rush.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverhead,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
37,Natalie R.,"Commack, NY",0,6,1.0,1.0,2017-09-30,"Worst experience at this establishment!! Never go to TGIF in Riverhead. Our service was horrible and very slow for a Saturday afternoon. Came with a small group of people (8) not huge (equivalent to two tables.) we just came from the Titan Run race and we're very hungry. Waitress did not seem to care, hair was messy and down, sloppy didn't check on us as we waited over an hour for food. Never checked on us after our food final arrived (75minutes after we ordered) Never served us our drinks correctly or asked if we needed refills. Most of us are experienced wait staff ourselves and this was the worst service. She never even apologized for food taking too long, her other tabes came and were served and left before we even got our food. Possible maybe she forgot to ring in our order but they never even offered anything while we waited very long. Spoke with manager she offered free desert which none of us wanted to wait for, left with free appetizer w/ purchased meal cards. (Not necessary since we will probably never return)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverhead,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
26,Dayna M.,"Ridge, NY",15,5,,1.0,2017-10-04,This place has really gone downhill !! A few years back the food and service was a lot better than it's been lately. It seems as though each recent visit just gets worse with today's visit being the worst. It wasn't crowded and the service took FOREVER. The food wasn't good the shrimp had an aftertaste. The bill was wrong and we were overcharged for our appetizers which were supposed to be the endless apps. The bathroom smells like an old towel.

32,Noah S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,,1.0,2017-11-05,"We came here on Sunday the day that the time changed trying to get two good cheeseburgers. We spent more than the hour we gained today just waiting for our food. There slogan should be Friday's, if you want food Friday come on Wednesday. It's to bad that the service is so slow because it is a good burger. The people are very friendly but I just don't know what the cooks are doing. We keep trying this restaurant thinking the service will be better but it just gets worst. This was definitely our last time there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverhead,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96
31,Vicki M.,"Holbrook, NY",0,5,,1.0,2017-11-11,"Horrible service at the bar, was ignored for a while. When the bartender finally came over he told us they were really busy (he looked stressed) to which I said, ""that's great!"" Meaning he was making money.. he didn't agree. Finally made our drinks, and my husbands wasn't even a full glass. Dirty dishes/glasses all around us which were never cleared. Bartender kept ignoring us, we finally had to ask the service bartender for another round. 4 small drinks cost $50...! Sooo not worth it! Used to love going there... no more.

30,Tracey S.,"East Hampton, NY",0,2,,1.0,2017-12-04,"Came here for lunch. The bartender took care of us, she was very nice but overwhelmed with her work load. I was disappointed, not in the service, but in the manager who sat the entire two hours i was there by the window on his computer completely unaware or unconcerned with his in need staff. As a previous corporate manager myself, if I performed like this I would have either been written up or fired for my lack of support to my staff. If I still worked in the Corp restaurant world i would ask Brittany to leave and come work for me. Bad management is never fun to work for.
