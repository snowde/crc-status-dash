3,Kimberly E.,"Rochester, NY",28,13,,5.0,2012-11-22,"I visit this restaurant about once a month and have a rewards card with them. The services, hospitality and quality of food is always good when me and my husband have gone. The food always comes out fresh and hot and the burgers are a consistent favorite of mine. There are greeters at the door to let you in and the servers are quick, exact, and helpful. Food is to the table quickly as well. The only down side is it is often busy and you have to wait. You can wait at the tables in the mall food court and it is usually less then the estimated time they give you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rochester-5?start=20,2.804,2.804,2.804,2.804,2.804
5,Nykki S.,"Redwood City, CA",10,26,24.0,4.0,2013-02-18,"My mom, brother and I have always had the tradition of going to Friday's on our birthdays. It's almost always been at this location. Of course there were times service could be slow, but that's pretty much anywhere. I don't recall any huge snafus regarding the waitstaff.  Food was always good and hot. Even though the older I got the less I enjoyed the loud birthday song crap, they were enthusiastic about it anyway.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rochester-5?start=20,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576
4,Scott U.,"Downingtown, PA",148,21,15.0,1.0,2014-03-15,Arrived at 1:00 pm and still didnt have food at 2:00 pm.  How hard can it be to make a club sandwich and chicken fingers?  Mgr. comped our meal but still fuming.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rochester-5?start=20,,,,,
23,Rachel G.,"Rochester, NY",30,391,52.0,3.0,2014-03-21,"This is an ok family restaurant for us, not fabulous but it's fairly inexpensive and both the kids and adults can agree to come here :) Burgers are a bit disappointing, surprisingly, over cooked and flavor lacking despite toppings. Apps are generally pretty good though nothing truly novel or remarkable. Our service the last time we went was a little too quick...our mains came out about 2 minutes after our appetizers. Cocktails are not bad, beer list limited (chain restaurant).Different ""specials "" are available each night of the week. I must commend their employees for providing very friendly and good service, enough to keep us returning even though their food is average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rochester-5,,,,,
2,Matt B.,"Rochester, NY",3,8,2.0,5.0,2014-05-21,"Had a great dinner with my daughter. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. I had ordered the sizzling chicken and cheese and itv was very well prepared. My daughter had pasta which was very warm, she would have liked it to have more sauce (wasn't much on it).

21,Bob A.,"Rochester, NY",49,226,21.0,4.0,2014-07-06,"I don't think I've been to a local TGI Friday's in 20+ years since we used to take the kids,  My wife even had a ""frequent customer"" card and I bet we still have some free app cards around the house turning yellow.  What prompted a visit was quite a good promotion in the mail with 3 discounts for each of the next three months. So despite the younger generation prefers trendy sports bars, we decided to try Fridays.  The menu is extensive, almost overpowering.  A page for dinners, burgers, sandwiches, salads, etc.  We both settled on a reasonably priced flat iron steak with different sides,  Enjoyed some tall drafts while waiting - my wife's first IPA tasted real watery and our waitress gladly gave my wife a sample of another IPA and then exchanged it without any problem.  A simple wedge salad with bleu cheese arrived first, simple but tasty and crisp.  When delivering the steaks, the server asked us to cut the steaks and see if they were to our liking; both were perfectly medium-rare as ordered.  Now I know for the price they can't be using prime beef, but the steaks were flavorful, lean, and a good-sized portion.  My rice and broccoli were both good. healthy choices for sides and appeared to be freshly prepared.  Unfortunately, the in-mall restaurant was far from busy for a Saturday evening.  Some of the newer additions to the mall (Bar Louie's, Red Robin, etc.) seemed to be doing much better. Even TC Hooligans, which serves crappy bar food had a crowd.  So I imagine TGIF is just not cool anymore but I hope the promotion brings back more customers to keep them going.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rochester-5,,,,,
0,Eddie V.,"Rochester, NY",4,2,,1.0,2014-10-06,"Terrible service. Almost an hour to get food when people who came in after us got their food way before us.  The food was blah, the burger dry they forgot the bacon and mayo and my sister's potatoes were nasty.  2nd bad experience here never going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rochester-5?start=20,,,,,
24,Nicole F.,"Hamlin, NY",10,45,32.0,1.0,2014-10-20,"I've lived in the area all my life and Fridays was always a ""go-to"" for me, friends and family. Within the past maybe four visits things have started to rapidly decline.  The service always used to be so quick and personable! A woman who was German/Russian, Sonia I believe her name was always took great care of us in the past. Kim also was a great server we've had in past visits. When I came to Fridays a few days ago with my boyfriend it was a date from hell. We came in on Friday night, it wasn't busy and now I know why. We were escorted to a table the busser never cleaned so we stood at the table for thirty seconds looking like idiots next to all the people sitting, eating. The host ran to go get spray and ""cleaned"" the table and by cleaned I meant wiped off the table, forgot to spray the booths and there were dirty napkins left untouched under the table.  Okay... So gross. Our server, Mike, did not reach our table for about five minutes after we were seated. That's not a very good first impression if you ask me. He was nice at least but he took forever to do everything. We ordered an appetizer, and we got it delivered by a different person about twenty minutes after ordering it. Chicken barbecue flatbread was not hot... It was borderline cold. I didn't say anything because I was starving. Twenty more minutes go by... We finally get our cold dinners! My burger and my boyfriends pasta took forty minutes! My burger was MW and it looked MR so I don't know why it took forty minutes? I knew it'd been sitting there as well because the cheese had gotten that hard coating where it doesn't ooze because it'd been sitting on the counter.  Again I didn't complain because I hate to be that person, I mean maybe it wasn't fully the servers fault but come on!! A few hours later... I didn't feel good. I threw up the burger and had bad diarrhea. Thanks for giving me a food borne illness Fridays! I won't be coming back to this location again because of this. Someone left my food sitting on a counter to obtain harmful bacteria or better yet they have employees who don't wash their hands and use gloves. My once frequented place that I loved has gone completely down hill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rochester-5,,,,,
18,Josh G.,"Spencerport, NY",196,254,285.0,3.0,2015-02-24,"I haven't been to a TGI Fridays since 2009...thus coming back to one is a big step for me after the amount of terrible experiences I've had in the past with a certain Ohio location but it was Valentine's Day, me and Kristin's one year anniversary and we wanted something so casual so we both decided TGI Friday's would be a simple but easy location to eat at since we aren't the 'formal' type... We spent about three hours roaming around the mall until around 4:30 when we arrived. I call it great timing but a few minutes after we were seated, it became P-A-C-K-E-D in a matter of seconds. We were seated rather quickly but strangely in a booth meant for four while their were plenty of tables for two around, guess they were dirty but I'll never know. The booth was next to the bar surrounded by lots of televisions but I assume the point of those TV's is to just watch and not listen because the pop music just drowns the sound out, what little of it is on.  A bit odd for this to be in a mall but it seemed to be a good size on the inside and certainly was decorated 'casual dining' style but it felt a bit dark even with all the light on around the restaurant, but it was most likely because the blinds were somewhat drawn down to limit natural light. It was nicely clean despite being busy and the seating was plush and comfortable...wasn't expecting that so it was a nice surprise. Our waitress Danielle (If I can remember correctly) arrived shortly after we were seated and we got to order our drinks. I just decided on water and so did Kristin mostly because we were both slightly ill and our taste buds not fully working. While waiting for drinks I got to take a look at the menu.  The selection is what you would expect but in case you don't know, the menu consisted of burgers, ribs, chicken, sandwiches, steaks, and salads (plus a kids menu). I was going to go for the chicken but I gave up on deciding, too much meats to decide from. Went with the flat iron steak, cooked rare and served with fries and mac & cheese while Kristin got the same but with a tomato salad instead of the cheese, because she has a great liking towards tomatoes for some reason... Waiting was the longest part but I can assume that was due to the amount of people crowding into the restaurant to it's peak capacity but we were patient so it didn't bother us that much.... The steaks were at the right temperatures when they arrived and were even topped with a square of butter and some seasoning. It was a bit hard to cut the meat but no their fault, that's just the cut of meat I had. The seasoned fries went great with ketchup but on their own, they were average. The mac & cheese was topped with an entire layer of assorted cheeses melted onto the top which made it have a crunchy, not so smooth texture. I like to call it ""cheese OVERLOAD"" because that's all I tasted was the excessive amount of cheese, not the actual pasta itself, still tasted good though. Kristin's tomato salad seemed to be lacking the 'salad' part but she didn't complain, the meals satisfied both of us. Total cost was around $35 plus tip towards Danielle, around average for a Friday's. I'm elated that we didn't run into any disrespectful staff or spoiled food, I was sort of expecting that from the beginning.  Great service and semi-above average food keeps TGI Friday's under my radar...we may be back a lot sooner than they think.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rochester-5,,,,,

17,Dave L.,"Rochester, NY",128,157,15.0,4.0,2015-03-27,I enjoy coming here.  The food service and atmosphere is always great.

1,John R.,"Rochester, NY",11,3,,1.0,2015-03-29,Service was fine.  Food was horribly over cooked.  I ordered a steak med well and lobster.  My husband ordered salmon.  My steak  was so over cooked it was hard to chew and my lobster was shriveled.  My husbands salmon the same way.  Totally not worth what we paid.  Very disappointed since we never get out anymore and it was my birthday treat.  We will not be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rochester-5?start=20,,,,,
10,Lea H.,"Rochester, NY",113,272,386.0,3.0,2015-04-11,Stopped here with my 12 year old for a bite. We decided to test out the endless appetizers. The place was busy but the waitress was fairly attentive. We ended up with 4 rounds of apps and the 4th round did take a little longer. We were happy with everything except the flatbread. Neither of us liked the taste of it.  The pot stickers were ok. We really liked the mozzarella sticks! We only do TGIF once in awhile. The food is ok but not outstanding. I'd eat here again if the kids asked but it wouldn't be my first choice. Too many other great local spots around.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rochester-5,,,,,

14,Jenn C C.,"Hamlin, NY",3,6,,3.0,2016-08-05,"My son and I went yesterday.  The food was fine.  I got the flat iron steak, it was cooked rare, not medium rare like I requested, but for me that is better then well done. They changed the tomato salad from the last time I went and I did not like it at all, but others might. My issue is with the entrance to the restaurant, not the entrance between the mall and the restaurant, but the actual front inside.  It smells.  It smells real bad and it has for years.  Please, please, please close the restaurant and clean it.  Dig it up, fumigate, and re-model.  The stink is so imbedded in the floors that a mop is not going to do the trick.

13,Linda G.,"Rochester, NY",1,8,,1.0,2017-02-17,"Well people let's begin with discussing endless appetizers.  They can't be shared,  you only get half an order after that, you can order a different appetizer from the list,  you wait 15 to 20 minutes between appetizers for the next and their appetizers are very poor quality as compared to the last 5 years.  The potato skins are greasy and cheese less, the boneless wings are tiny and the mozzarella sticks are tasteless.    Now let's move on to the main course the other diners had with me.  The flat iron stake is extremely chewy, and side of broccoli had no butter, salt and pepper.  Burger was ok but served with cold limp tasteless fries.  Left and will not be back!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rochester-5,,,,,
11,Matthew R.,"Rochester, NY",97,1,,1.0,2017-02-17,Worst experience ever.  After waiting an hour for a table a party of 10 we were told that they were wiping down the table.  20 minutes later they were still wiping down the same empty table.  When we finally got seated we waited 45 minutes to get drinks and by that time the 2 kids we had were done.  When we approached the host to speak to a manager we were grilled for the cause and then treated very poorly when we explained our situation.  Understaffed and blamed it on the endless apps.  I get that endless apps is a great promo but really.  Endless apps caused us to wait 45 minutes before you took our order?  Fail.  If you could give no stars that would be too much.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rochester-5,,,,,
12,Rome S.,"Albion, NY",0,6,1.0,2.0,2017-04-05,"Im sitting here right now with my family.   Trying to enjoy the endless apps but it is taking what feels like forever to get the apps.  I was told ""since everyone is ordering endless apps the cook has a large amount to make"". It's now 9:35p Wednesday  and there's a handful of guests and they're open until 12:00am.  So I don't understand what the hold up is.  I'm embarrassed because I raved about TGIF to my family who have never been here and it's not a good impression.  The staff was courteous and helpful the kitchen was slower than molasses.  I guess they've stopped asked my us what else we wanted to order Not too happy right now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rochester-5,,,,,
7,Nurjahan K.,"Brockport, NY",3,12,27.0,4.0,2017-06-07,"I love their fried beans. Its too good. Recently they got a new drink called Poppin Boba - it's coconut water with either mango or strawberry boba. Delicious!!! Must try it! Their servers are very friendly and helpful.  I have tried their unlimited appetizers. They have very limited options of apps to choose from. However among them, BBQ Chicken Flatbread is a must try. We also tried their Sizzling Chicken & Shrimp. It's okay. Won't order it again. The shrimp which is tossed in bruschetta marinara, didn't taste good.  I love their chicken wings and they have good drinks. Their dessert Oreo Madness is superb. Try it!!! So overall, the place has good food and services. Though it's a little bit expensive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rochester-5,,,,,
6,Jaden G.,"Spencerport, NY",2,14,39.0,4.0,2017-08-15,"QUICK REVIEW: TGI Friday's is a sweet place. A large menu, great food, friendly service, and much more all add up to a fun time. IN-DEPTH REVIEW: TGI Friday's kind of surprised me with its many great features. Taken care of by a very friendly and helpful waitress, she was more than happy to explain the endless appetizers to us immediately. I'm aware the price of the endless appetizer's is increasing to $15, but for $10, my friend ordered at least 10 small to medium sized appetizers for us to share. It's simple: you pick 2 at a time to be brought out from a list of 8 or 10 different appetizers. The other part of the deal is someone from your table has to order a meal. Every time the waitress brought our appetizers out, we told her which ones we would like next, and she'd immediately get those goin. Once we were almost done with one round, she'd bring out the next, and so on. He ordered the appetizers, while me and my brother ordered meals. We got way more food than we thought, ultimately paying $40 for what would have been almost $100 worth of food. The appetizers along with my meal were well cooked and timed perfectly. Also, I suggest going at night during the week when it isn't as crowded. This, obviously, avoids the large groups that come especially on Friday nights. If people complain about this restaurant, they most likely went at the wrong time and/or didn't utilize the great option of the endless appetizers. Would highly recommend to anyone. VERDICT: 4/5 stars for a place that delivers on food, service, and a customer-friendly menu that'll please just about anyone, depending on how you use it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rochester-5,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
