98,Rani H.,"Rockville, MD",10,10,,1.0,2012-01-29,"I have been coming to Fridays and even recommending it to friends for years now. I, myself, am a waitress for an OSI company and am very familiar with this industry. Nobody likes it when a group comes in the hour before close but its our job; thus, we deal with it and provide the best service we can. I will NEVER recommend to TGI Friday's on Rockville Pike again! this was the most appalling experience i have ever had at a restaurant. the bartenders gave us great service and my complaint is not against them. i was with a group of other servers and we had just gotten off work when we decided to come in and eat at the bar.the meal went fine, food was good, and the drinks were good. At the end of our meal an aggressive white man who (and i seriously intend no sarcasm)we all thought was drunk came and yelled at myself and another lady with our group that we had 15 minutes to finish our food an ""get out"" while nursing whatever it was he had in a styrofoam cup. we were already sorting out our bill and packing our food to go so as not to be a pain when this guy came by. the guys with us even scooted closer to my friend and i because some weirdo was yelling at us and appeared to be picking a fight with a patron behind us. Then, to top it off he and an old man start screaming like they are looking for a fight at all the patrons to drink up. Is it really necessary to encourage people to chug their alcohol and then get out and drive home? way to be responsible. these men were aggressive as hell and were even goading people into a physical altercation (which we all stared at in shock and were afraid a fight would break out)out when they decided to start taking cups from peoples lips and tossing them over the bar like animals. the only time i have seen people act this reckless and belligerent is when i've had to deal with drunks camping at my own job and picking fights. these so called managers took full beers and dumped them out in front of customers while goading. this was childish behavior and i cannot believe it is tolerated by your company. i will never go back to that restaurant nor recommend it again. these guys didn't listen to a single thing their customers had to say and sent a full bar of angry people storming out while their bartenders sat by looking like they hated simply being there. we paid our full bill even though three tall beers and a margarita were  tossed out and our coworker was shoved around like we were kids in a school yard and had a margarita snatched from his mouth as he way drinking from the straw! are you serious! it was ridiculous!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville?start=160,2.28,2.28,2.28,1.956,2.28
59,Joe G.,"Silver Spring, MD",50,89,25.0,1.0,2012-02-14,"This place stanks! How much does it stank?  Like a boss. I ordered the sirloin steak with fries and roasted veggies.  The steak was cooked a whole lot on one side and a whole lot less on the other side.  The meat itself was okay and could've used a little more seasoning.  The funny thing about this entree was that the sides filled up most of the dish making the steak look like a side. At the end of the meal, my friend's $15 meal turns into a $30 meal.  It turns out his salmon wasn't included in their combo meal and the waiter either didn't notice or bother to say anything when he ordered.  I tasted his salmon and it wasn't even worth the $15. After we pay, we get back our paper change minus our coin change.  If they asked, I wouldn't really care if they kept the coin change, but the presumption that we wouldn't care irritated me. I'll never come back to TGIF for their overpriced microwaved food or apathetic, incompetent service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville?start=100,2.2,2.2,2.2,2.084,2.2

Even when I left hungry it took 20 minutes for the manager to comp our check so we could leave.  This is not the first time we have been miserable here.   Go to a different Fridays.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville?start=120,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.116,2.12
156,Scott M.,"Owings, MD",22,55,5.0,1.0,2012-03-25,"I am usually a pretty forgiving person, but service here is pathetic. The 2x I have been in I have eaten at the bar. Each time ordering dinner, having to stare down the bartender to actually place the order.  As soon as they drop a beer in front of you, they disappear.  They seem to be more interested in talking to each other than the customer. Even leaving tonight there were 2 employees at the exit when leaving, talking to each other, failing to offer the standard 'goodbye' one would get at other locations.   The place (bar area) is dirty and in need of someone managing the building who cares.  The food is consistent with other Friday's, so at least they have that going for them. That gets them the 1 star.  I guess if you are looking for a great place to socialize while working with no accountability, you should definitely get a job here. Just don't come for the food or drink.  I will go to Ruby Tuesdays across the street or Chili's from here on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville?start=120,2.04,2.04,2.04,2.18,2.04

Scenario: My son turned 7 and wanted to TGI Fridays to celebrate his birthday with family because he loves the birthday song and dance they do. Understood, it's a packed Saturday night, lot of people waiting for tables, lot of orders being prepared in the back, etc. The food in itself was pretty good (go with triple play), but what pissed me off is the lack of common sense by people. As OUR server, KNOWING it's this boy's birthday... How do you start the birthday song and ice cream delivery SEEING that: 1. Birthday boy is still eating his dinner! NOT READY for desert yet. 2. Not everyone was at the table OR done with THEIR dinner!! COMMON SENSE!!!!!!!! HELLO?!?!?! THEN!!! OMG, THEN just drop the check on us... Were you rushing us because you had people waiting?? WTF?!

51,Bethany S.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",99,49,6.0,1.0,2012-10-12,"I know it's a large chain, so take every experience with a grain of salt. Even having very low expectations, they still managed to surprise me with how terrible they are. Because we had read the reviews about this location, we did not go until recently. One evening, we just wanted drinks and dessert. We heard if we sit at the bar the service was much better, so we did follow that advice. Let me just preface this, with whoever is in charge of writing the menu descriptions at corporate headquarters, wherever they are, is the only one doing their job right apparently. This is what we read online (viewed on our phones so images did not load. you know, flash...) ""Oreo® Madness Cookies and Cream ice cream sandwiched between layers of Oreo® cookie crust with caramel and fudge."" Okay, that sounds pretty good. Here's how our experience went down: Sunday afternoon, and while a football game was on, it was neither Redskins nor Ravens, therefore, really wasn't that busy. And there were 3 bartenders. We were there 10 minutes before being acknowledged. We asked what the drink specials were, the only thing we were told was $3 Budweiser/Bud Light. My boyfriend settled for Bud light and I just ordered bottled beer. But then we read the specials menu, and sure enough, there were rail drink and cocktail specials they did not tell us about, that were still going on for 2+ more hours. We ordered our desserts. And my boyfriend's ""Oreo Madness"" came out, and it was simply a Klondike Oreo Ice Cream sandwich, with some hershey's syrup drizzled on the plate. The same exact ice cream sandwiches that you can buy by the 6 pack for $2.50 at the grocery store.  So much for ""layers of cookie crust with caramel and fudge"" because there was not even a hint of caramel anywhere on the plate. Lesson learned won't do that again. Despite this, we decided to stay for another drink or two.  THIS WAS BY FAR THE WORST PART Of the THREE bartenders working, every single one of them was completely IGNORING us.  As soon as we would make eye contact with them, they instantly turned around and walked the other direction. All of them did this at least 5 times. Then, when we ordered the rail drinks that were on special, they rolled their eyes and acted like it was the biggest inconvenience in the world for them to make them. It was 15 minutes before we got our second drinks. Then it took 20 minutes and more than 5 more times of getting ignored after making eye contact, that we could get our check. I'm even surprised my boyfriend left a tip, because the service was so terrible, if I were the one that picked up the tab, they would have gotten a big fat ZERO. I will never go to another TGI Fridays in my life.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville?start=100,2.24,2.24,2.24,2.244,2.24

I was surprised that our dishes were so flavorful. I can't recall the names of the dishes, sorry :( . We had an flatbread appetizer and a chips and dip appetizer. The flatbread was pretty good, IMHO. My entree was a pasta dish with cracked peppercorn and chicken. The chicken was a bit dry, but I wasn't really expecting too much anyway. I can't really recall my boyfriend's meal, but he seemed to like it a lot. The service was pretty good. Our waitress was really attentive, but treated us as if we're regulars which was a nice homey feel. I also ordered a Peach Margarita and it was pretty strong, which definitely isn't a bad thing!

So loud I literally had to raise my voice to the point of yelling to talk to my brother and mother. I'm not the ""bar"" type guy so maybe it is me that just doesn't like the place.

46,Nicole R.,"Sebastian, FL",155,148,7.0,1.0,2013-06-26,"TGI Friday's is mediocre no matter which way you cut it. We knew that going into this dinner. But, my brother was in town for one night and staying down the street so we came from VA to meet him (big mistake, Maryland, as far as states go, is mediocre itself) for a quick dinner. There were 6 of us ... myself and my husband, my sister and her friend, and my brother and his coworker.   Everything was fine aside from the fact that they were out of pretty much every on-tap beer (literally, we requested 3-4 and somehow, they had ""just run out in the last few minutes,"" yet it was a Sunday night around 9pm, and there weren't that many people there ... but, I digress).  We ordered, got our food ... my brother's coworker finally settled on Mich Ultra, because they were out of a bunch of bottled beer too (seriously!?), and it only took about 20 minutes to get each of his two beers. When it came time to pay our bill, I told the waitress one check was fine, we could split it (as my husband and I were together, my sister and her friend split something but were paying separately, and my brother was paying for his coworker).  She insisted on splitting it for us, and came back with 6 checks.  No big deal, I gave her my credit card wrapped in both my husband's check and mine. When the checks came, everyones appeared to be correct, we signed and left. Well, today, it looks like that waitress didn't charge me for hubby's meal, and wound up closing it out on my sister's credit card (sister is a broke college student who works hard for her money) ... AND she tipped herself MORE than I tipped her.  So, essentially, at the end of the night, she decided she wanted to make more money and tipped herself and extra almost $4. So, my sister, in essence, paid for her meal and my husbands, and tipped this idiot waitress double.  She's disputing the charge with her bank and we've both called the restaurant and spoken to the manager, Amanda (who was very nice and helpful), and she's looking into it. Either way. Even if this WAS a mistake and she did accidentally close out the wrong check on the wrong card, the waitress tipped herself and I'm sorry, but that's shady, dishonest, and frankly ILLEGAL. We've been assured that it'll be taken care of, sister will get her money back, and the waitress will be ""handled.""

The young servers and runners were often seen loafing around the drink station enjoying eachother's company, instead of attending to guests. The descriptions of the dishes were sometimes incomplete, and the staff isn't as knowledgable as they should be.  Despite the half price appetizer deal on the menu, the receipt did not reflect the deal and we almost didn't catch their almost 10$ mistake.

Okay cool, he said no prob and walked away... And then came back within a minute and asked if we were ready. Same answer, walked away again. Then came back two more times before we were ready again within a super short amount of time. I mean, the restaurant wasn't busy so why are you rushing us?

The best thing is you have 2 happy hours...first one during the after work hours and a second one starting at 10pm until close!!! That means almost everything is $5 or half off. Yum! The menu has changed a bit. They now have a ""little bites"" menu too. Tapas at Fridays. Um. Ok.  I was going to get a burger but decided to try 3 little things. I started with the Thai pork tacos from the little bites menu. They were not kidding when they said ""little"" bites. As a woman, I finished one of these tiny tacos in 2 bites but let's be honest...you can do it in one. The flavor was o.k. but at $7 I did not think there was value for my money. As it was Tuesday, everything Jack Daniels is $5. Drinks and 3 menu items. I like the sauce so I decided on the sesame jack chicken strips. They were more like long nuggets instead of strips. They were perfectly fried and nicely sauced. Best thing I ordered...but did the serving get smaller because the price did? Let's be honest. I love me some tater skins. I pretty much watched the clock to get to Fridays for the late night happy hour just for some fried wedges of potatoes loaded with cheese, bacon, scallions and sour cream!!! .......WTF??? (Mom, that is ""what the fridays???) Some wacko decided to play around with the perfect bar food (next to buffalo wings) and they re-vamped it into some sad lump that Taco Bell wouldn't even serve!  First they mashed the potato and formed it into a triangular yet curved form. Why? Then they fried it up and even though it sound like it would be a delicious potato pancake, it was a dried up, crumbly, messy lump. Then, they put processed cheese in the middle. Huh? I like processed cheese but not on a tater skin. I saw bacon but no scallions. At least there was sour cream. So, most of the yummy elements were still there. I cut off a piece and it crumbles. I spear it with the fork and half falls off. The trick is to pick it up with your fingers.  Bottom line is it does taste yummy. But why mess with perfection? A hollowed out potato half, flash fried and covered with shredded cheddar, bacon and chives. A cute little boat waiting to be topped with sour cream. Fridays...blasphemy!  I may be back for 3 buck Thursdays....but when Chili's right down the street has happy hour from 2pm to 8pm I really don't see the point. Overpriced happy hour food and inattentive service at the bar? Grab some beer at Dietle's and taco bell instead. ps. This was tough for me to write as most of my reviews are positive and 4 stars. I believe that if you have a bad restaurant experience you should tell a manager so they can try to correct it. Trust me, they want you to leave happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville?start=80,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.3440000000000003,2.76

When he came out he told me that he was from the south and that it was lobster which was a total lie. I told him that he was lying. And then when the waitress came back she even told me the cook said that it was what they were using and he was unsure what it was. This has got to be illegal, advertising something that it isn't. I would have excepted an excuse like that they ran out and were using crawfish instead. I am not one of those usual complainers. I am going to be following up with the tgifriday headquarters.

Friday's is the place to go when you want some deep-fried, crappy bar food and some happy hour drink specials on beer. Needless to say, we were caught in the midst of a winter storm the other day and having not gone to the grocery store, we decided to brave the cold and walk over to Friday's to see what was on the menu. We got there and waited at the hostess stand for a good 5 minutes while 3 employees stood in the back and held a conversation. 1 of those employees happened to be the manager who finally approached us and asked if we needed a table...? Perhaps this was just an anomaly-as it's perfectly normal for people who don't want a seat/table to walk into an empty restaurant during a storm and stand around at the wait stand just for the hell of it.  Well, once we were shown to our table we sat there for well over 5 minutes without having anyone come over and offer us water or anything. (REMINDER-THIS PLACE WAS EMPTY!!!) We were fed up at this point and decided to leave. The manager then approached us and asked why we were leaving...Uh dude-the fact that you don't know why only further underscores the need for the low rating I just gave this place.

The food usually tastes the same regardless of which one you go to. I don't know what happened at this one though. My friends brought me here for my birthday. They suggested sushi but NO I just had to request a place that had drinks, appetizers, desserts, and a lot of noise because I was planning to turn up...on a budget (hence Fridays).  First off the waiter was very personable. He was a cool guy who told us we'd come to the right place to celebrate because just that night they were having a bartending competition, so the drinks would be phenomenal.  Riiiight. How about 'no,' Scott? Scene 1: Drinks My margarita tasted like dirty dish water. I don't know what the hell went wrong with that. There was zero alcohol in it and if it hadn't been for the fact that it was frozen I would actually think that it was dirty dish water. My friends also hated their drinks as well. No getting drunk for us.  Scene 2: The appetizer... Spinach artichoke dip. Had it millions of times before. My first bite, something sharp went up into the sweet spot between my teeth and gums. I spent a few minutes pulling sharp artichoke ""thingamajigs"" (bristles?) out of my gum. Imagine a bunch of shredded tooth picks. The chips were hard as hell too.  Scene 3: The entree... I got old faithful, Sizzling chicken and shrimp. The chicken was overcooked by a lot. Like...dry on the inside, super dry and chewy on the outside. The shrimp were okay.  I decided to not even waste my time with dessert. I ended up going to another restaurant afterwards for that.  The ONLY saving grace for this place was the manager, Jake.

101,Art T.,"Crofton, MD",189,383,136.0,3.0,2016-07-19,"Chains are always hit or miss to review.  For one thing, while your experience at one should be the same across the board, due to franchising and staff it's impossible to guarantee this.  So, the intent of creating a cookie-cutter event isn't always achievable.  Another reason I'm always leery about reviewing chains, because of their prevalence, one typically has an expectation when visiting any location. So it was with T.G.I.Friday's, which was the destination after an event at a local Rockville hangout.  I have to admit, this was a bit above my expectations, though still close enough to them to warrant the rating. PROS:  * The servers were very friendly, and I think everyone's order was accurate (we were a big table).  I'll reference the drink situation in the CONS below. * My pretzel sticks were really good, some of the best I've ever had.  There was a light crispy exterior, almost like a fried coating, though probably butter glazed.  But super fresh and warm and soft.  The beer cheese dip was a great side for them.  I'd order these again. * Parking was pretty easy to find, even on busy Rockville Pike.  The lot has a lot of spaces, though I would be cautious during holidays.  I'm sure it gets packed then. * Décor was fun, and not too over-the-top. CONS: * There was a problem with our drinks.  A few people ordered beers, and because they brought them out all at the same time without any way of differentiating them, they got mixed up, and nobody knew which beer was whose.  Very sloppy. * The rest of the food I tried (we all did a bunch of apps) was only okay.  The mozzarella sticks were actually very bland.  The marinara was likewise almost flavorless.  The buffalo wings were okay, mildly spicy and well cooked.  But nothing was really that awe-inspiring, or even that noteworthy (aside from my aforementioned pretzel sticks). * We were sat in the room with the sloped glass ceiling.  The lights were almost touching our heads even though we were seated.  Very poor design. * The restroom was filthy.  I went once to wash my hands when we arrived, and the condition was unchanged about two hours later as we were leaving. There were definitely some pluses, but not enough for me to rave about this place.  It was decent, a normal TGIF experience from my own personal expectations.  Which, admittedly, are typically not very high at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville?start=20,2.96,2.7,2.7,2.444,2.8040000000000003

I ordered a drink my friend however could not find her ID and was unable to order a drink. I then noticed a table became available and asked to be seated in a booth. During this time my friend found her ID and asked for a drink. The waiter ID'd her and walked away to place the order. He then came back 10 mins later and requested to see both of our ID's. We again pulled them out and showed him. Placed an order and waited for our food. 5 mins later he comes back again and says I am going to have to send the manager over because there seems to be an issue with your IDs. The bartender advised me your friend didn't have an ID. We explained yes she could not find her license however once situated she was able to locate it. Again we both showed our licenses. 5 mins later the manager comes and asks whats the issue. We explained we're being asked repeatedly to show our Ids and we have shown them multiple times. She had no remorse or sympathy regarding this and didn't have an explanation as to why we were asked to show our ID multiple times. At this point I am starting to get upset as I have never experienced an issue with my license before. I am a 28 year old woman with a valid drivers license. I've visited the same location with the same ID multiple times with no issues at all. So after again explaining to her the issue she asks to see them AGAIN. At this point I have showed my license at least 5 times and I am fed up. I informed the manager she is no help and this is ridiculous to be harassed over a license. She just stood there looking dumb.

103,Sara B.,"Derwood, MD",0,1,4.0,1.0,2017-08-17,I think I had the worst food experience with them. We ordered regular burger and chicken sandwich. The bread was hard to eat and probably old.

106,Sharon J.,"Silver Spring, MD",17,2,,1.0,2017-08-19,I don't think I've ever been to a place to eat and didn't feel like the waitress deserved a tip until today. The Fridays on Rockville pike was the worst! The food was good but the service was awful.  The waitress at the bar I believe her name was Jessica. Can't be sure since she never introduced herself. She barely acknowledged that we were there. She never came over to see if we were ok until we had to ask for silverware. Then she only gave one of us one set of silverware but she gave the couple next to us both a set. Had to wait until she came back to see if they were ok to ask for a second set of silverware. She never smiled at had any pleasantries to us. Clearly not her best day. The table behind us was filled with  plates that didn't get cleaned off until about a hour after we sat down. The person who I believe was the manager never inspected the area enough to notice a smell coming from somewhere in the bar area. Overall worst experience I've had at a Friday's Won't be going there again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville?start=20,1.84,2.56,2.56,,2.2720000000000002
22,Amanda A.,"Rockville, MD",87,3,,1.0,2017-09-14,"My brother and I came I for lunch and were very much disappointed. We got the Friday combo appetizer, and the potato skins were so over done the celery was easier to bite into. Our sever, Albert, was very pleasant when he was at the table but had no sense of urgency so we made no complaints. For entrees my brother ordered a burger medium and it came well done. I had a fried chicken sandwich and the chicken itself was absolutely disrespectful. The edges so black it looked like beef at first. I picked off some edges and we waited for our server to appear. He was taking a while so we started to eat and he didn't come back until we were halfway finished so once again we decided not to say anything. In all the service was lacking and the kitchen seems to need to pay closer attention to how long they're cooking the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville?start=40,1.76,2.56,2.56,,2.24

I don't know where these other reviews are coming from but I must say they also seem to impress me when I go. Our server Steven was very attentive and overall great! Our food was amazing!

I ordered traditional wings (6 buffalo and 6 parmesan), which was excellent; and rack of ribs, which as on point.  Thats a lot of food--but its still good for lunch on tomorrow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville,1.92,2.55,2.55,,2.298

112,Lo W.,"Germantown, MD",0,1,,1.0,2017-10-18,"Some friends and I went one night ago , we all work in restaurants so we how it can be . There were about six tables in the whole restaurant . Our server had us , a two top and a party of 6 that left . When we got our beer we could taste that it sat and the other drinks were watered down.  And the bartender staring at us made it very  uncomfortable .And when we got our food it was not hot. Out drinks for empty and the server was no where to be found . He gave us a discount and said yeah i did that so you can tip me better . Like um no. Your services Sucked and the food quality was gross . This place has gone down hill. I never saw the manager nor did they come do a  table checks to see how we were doing and working in a restaurant  we know you're supposed have a manger  that goes by and does table  checks to see how everything is.

Every single employee we encountered tonight from the host, the servers(we saw about 6 different ones at our table over the course of the night) and managers were all incredibly rude and disrespectful. I have never left a business as angry as I was tonight. We were here for 2+ hours for the worst service ever. The appetizers were good, but there was hair in my food and my husbands food was cold. If you would like to hear the full story I would be glad to share with you detail for detail but it's too much to type on here. They would be better off firing everyone and starting fresh!  DO NOT GO HERE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. DO NOT EAT HERE. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY. DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT GO HERE.

2,Taniya G.,"Fairburn, GA",316,10,1.0,1.0,2017-11-05,"horrible. the bartenders and I say bartenders because this goes for every last one of them behind the bar. THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS ON THEIR MENU.  To start we sat at the bar for 5 minutes before being acknowledged and once we finally got the attention of the young woman working she asked if we wanted to order appetizers...? I responded with ""yes, we would like to order drinks first, because we've been sitting here waiting."" I asked her for the Proficiency Pinot Noir - which was on their Happy Hour menu. She brought me back white wine. I asked her. ""Is this the Pinot Noir?"" she said ""yes.""  PINOT NOIR IS A RED WINE. I coached her by letting her know this and she returned with a glass of Meiomi.  Although this is not the listed wine on their Happy Hour I was tired of telling someone how to do their job. My boyfriend ordered a Budlight- also on Happy Hour. The bartender comes back and announces that he has a tall Miller lite. We gave it back to him without drinking it and asked for it be replaced with a Blue Moon (also on Happy Hour) he came back with a fresh beer and all was great.  We ordered the basket of bones, which was delicious but before we could enjoy we had to ask for silverware and the ranch and blue cheese that was to come with our appetizer. I'm disappointed because TGI is such a fun, nice place to come where the food is good and the drinks are tasty. But the Rockville Pike staff have no idea what's on their menu to sell and have zero to no hospitality. GET IT TOGETHER.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville,1.84,2.48,2.48,,2.224

I did feel like we were forgotten about a few times ? We had the jack sliders and the buffalo wings apps . The wings were a little spicy but the meat was good. My sliders were delicious !

This unprofessional little girl made the second drink with another type of liquor not henny as request . After informing her I didn't want this drink she throw the drink in the floor. Her behavior was deplorable and she needs to be trained on a customer service sensitivity class on treatment for all Minorities. This place has horrible reviews .

3,Rosanna W.,"Rockville, MD",79,163,341.0,2.0,2018-01-02,"Oh man oh man. TGI Fridays. I haven't been here in ages. We got seated right away. Ordered our drinks and asked for a few more minutes to look at the menu. They have so many options on their menu. After we knew what we wanted, we waited for our waiter to come back. Everytime he passed by our table, I would look at him hoping to catch his attention and he completely would avoid eye contact with me. Finally he came back and took our orders.  We ordered the appetizer platter - chicken wings and mozzarella sticks and the cajun shrimp and chicken pasta (half size).  I saw a waiter and waitress just chillin, sitting with their friends talking. Not paying attention to any of their tables. Just chatted up for a bit. They would leave here and there, but I never seen such poor service at a restaurant. The food took forever to come.... and once it did come, the half size pasta for $10 was really small. It comes in a small little pan. The pasta wasn't bad at all, but for $10 and the size we got was not worth it. When we received our food, we didn't get any utensils or napkins. My small pasta came with a spoon... why would you give someone a spoon to eat pasta? .... It took forever to flag down our waiter because he was too busy talking to his friends. Finally received our utensils.. and finally we ate... Terrible awful service. Food took forever. Don't think I'll be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville,1.64,2.48,2.48,,2.144

0,Kristin E.,"Washington, DC",208,63,28.0,4.0,2018-01-08,"I've been here several times being from the DC area. There's only a handful of Fridays close to me, this being one of those locations. This review is *mostly* based on my most recent experience. My best friend and I came over from the shopping center across the street wanting some good bar food for lunch. Of course, the restaurant was less populated than it is at night or on the weekend, but it was still pretty busy. Our server was great and it wasn't super loud per the norm.  We ordered The Fridays Combo with boneless bbq wings, loaded potato skins and mozzarella sticks. The only thing I was disappointed with on the appetizer were that the potato skins were pretty dry and sour cream wasn't put as a dip (which I think it is supposed to make an appearance?). I ordered the Chicken Quesadilla as my entree and I've honestly had better. 6/10.  Overall, I recommend this location, especially if you're going to get a drink and catch a game at the bar. The bartenders are pretty nice and make a good drink, too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville,1.76,2.46,2.46,,2.18
7,Debbie S.,"Falls Church, VA",0,6,,1.0,2018-01-12,Only reason to give a start was our waiter who tried to accommodate us and be as nice as possible. We made a reservation 4 days ahead for 12 only to get to the restaurant and learn they did not take it. We had to wait over 40 minutes to get seated for another 30 to get the order and another 30 for the food. Our waiter even though very personable seem to have a lot of tables to take care of as we hardly saw him. Meanwhile 2-3 waiters were talking and texting at the hostess table all the time. Will never come back and wouldn't recommend anybody to either.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville,1.76,2.46,2.46,,2.18
