377,Anthony N.,"San Gabriel, CA",1,5,,2.0,2012-12-18,"I've been waiting for this place to open ever since they announced it but it was definitely not worth the wait. We got seated rather quickly but after waiting 15 min we had to flag someone down. He was not our waiter but he has the only bright spot in what was a dismal dining experience. He took our order and came back 5 times before our actual waitress even showed up. We got the nacho, steak and shrimp, and steak and ribs. The food took a long time to come out but it was decent, but when we asked for jalapenos we were told there would be an extra charge. Then we asked for steak sauce and were told there would be an extra charge. Might come back for happy hr, but other than that I think we'll be going somewhere else from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rosemead?start=420,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003
310,A M.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,94,105.0,5.0,2012-12-18,"For this just opening 5 days ago (my visit was Friday 12/14/12), I couldn't be more impressed! The service was friendly, and the food was pretty bomb. Loved the spinach dip appetizer. Unfortunately, I ordered the potato skins for my meal, and they were poor quality to say the least. There was barely any cheese or bacon on them and the potato was pretty dry! I could have gotten better quality TGIF potato skins in the frozen freezer isle at the local grocery store. :(   I ordered the Ultimate Electric Lemonade which is always perfect at any TGIF's I've been to. (Not the typical watered down alcoholic beverage like most restaurants serve these days) The bf, ordered The Pepper Crusted Pork Chop which he liked and wished that there were two of instead of one. His side of mashed potatoes were reaaaally tasty and moist!!!  But what topped the dinner experience was the Whiskey Cake! TO DIE FOR! and I'm not even a fan of cake!!! It was a warm toffee cake topped with pecans and a Jack Daniels whiskey butterscotch with a side of vanilla ice cream! Yummy!! (I even think I might favor it over my one and only favorite dessert at BJ's... the Pizookie!! (*Gasp*) Our server on this evening still didn't have the menu memorized, and she was pretty forgetful when we asked for waters and certain other items, but I don't knock her for that. (She's still learning!) She was very friendly and quite funny tho. Other servers and managers were constantly stopping to gather dirty plates, offer to refill drinks, and check in on us as they passed our table. There was a 45 minute wait that went relatively quickly. The ambiance of the restaurant is more modern than most TGIF's I've been to in the past, and albeit loud inside... I enjoyed myself. It would be great if they could add more seating inside for people waiting, but overall I enjoyed the evening, and look forward to going back soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rosemead?start=320,3.124,3.124,3.124,3.124,3.124
304,A H.,"Los Angeles, CA",185,73,51.0,5.0,2012-12-19,"Regardless of the long wait list. I would come back to this location for a night out with friends. My friends and I went on a Friday night, we called 10 minutes before so we didn't have to wait so long. Still a 20 minute wait when arriving, would of been 40! After finally opening a location closer to 626 area, I recommend that you call before you head over. Environment: The restaurant is a little small, not too cramped but enough for kids to run around. It's clean and welcoming. It's loud but its more of a family/bar area. Customer service: It was GREAT. When arriving to check in at our call, the hostess was very pleasant to double check our names. (They aren't like other restaurants where you call in and when you get there they didn't put your name). Our waitress was really awesome and friendly. Even though the wait is long for the food, our waitress always came by to check up on us. KUDOS to her! Food: The food was so-so. Could be improved. It was completely packed and I suppose it was unexpected for the first Friday. I ordered the Rib-eye steak with lobster. The lobster was ok, steak was a little over cooked and dry. Parmesan fries were AWESOME :) not too much seasoning but just right. Beverages: The drinks took awhile to get to our table, but it was what got us to get started or else we would of gotten antsy about our food orders. There are different types of drinks, so its based on your preference. I got the waitress's favorite, Electric Lemonade. It was okay, but its pretty! Haha Overall: Due to the long wait on getting a table and foods/beverages. Understood that it was a high volume of customers. The customer service overrode it. KUDOS!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rosemead?start=320,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.092000000000001
443,Drew P.,"Temple City, CA",17,147,,3.0,2012-12-19,"You know what's wild about this place? All day happy hour is served all day on SUNDAY --- not FRIDAY. So why would I be thanking god it's Friday brus? Well, I mean I always thank god that it's any day because I love being alive, you know? Positive radiant energy beams and shit. But, honestly, the cheapy boy in me thanks god that it's Sunday whenever I'm feelin' some ULTIMATE Electric lemonades or ULTIMATE Long Islands or ULTIMATE mojitos. I am not sure in the slightest why they are ultimate. Maybe it's because they all have BOMBAY gin? I dunno why I'm ALL CAPSing some things. Sorry, I'll stop. Any way, the above named drinks are 5 bucks. Yeah, I can be informative if I want to be. I obviously came in this past Sunday and loaded up on the happy hour options. I am a frugal filipino after all (no I'm not -- real filipinos would call themselves pinoys or some thing). Copped the $5 boneless wingz which were a decently sweet deal. The mozz sticks and potstickers ain't really worth it tho. I mean, yeah, they're technically appetizers so you shouldn't be expecting mountains of food any way but you literally get six pieces. SIX PIECES. I had to caps for emphasis, fuck it. Basket of fries is okay but it's just a basket of fries. They on the salty side too. Bottled beers are $3.50, I think domestic beers are $3? I got myself an Angry Orchard apple cider because I been on the hard cider tip these last coupla months. I dunno why. It's just so much more drinkable than a regular beer to me (ay don't think me a pussy bru, I drink IPAs and str8 whiskey yaheard --- seriously, I do, but sometimes I just want a dry, sweet cider).  An ironic thing is that the w0rld fam0us potato skins taste worse than the TGI potato skin flavored chips that you can cop from your local grocery store. Seriously. Go try it and compare. Guy Fieri owns this place and so it gets 3 stars.

My steak was room temperature, my broccoli was cold, and lobster was too salty and the only thing hot was my baked potato......For the price i payed for my food i could have gone to HOUSTON s instead.....Would of gotten great HOT food and great QUICK service.

195,Alan K.,"Monterey Park, CA",472,653,10.0,2.0,2012-12-23,"This is a new location and I was excited to see one open up more closer to the 626 area. Came here during a weekend when it just opened, so I didn't run into any crowd issues as the restaurant was pretty empty.  FOOD QUALITY: For a restaurant that just opened, I'm sorely disappointed by the quality of food here ..    Two things rang in my mind upon the sampler platter: the prized potato skins didn't feel fresh .. as if it was toaster-ovened. On top of that, I was disappointed that the potato skins were piled on top of each other such that the cheese would be touching the neighboring skin.  When my burger came, half of the burger had fallen over and the ingredients were kind of scattered. I would have liked the brioche bun to be toasted to add firmness to the bread while remaining soft, and would have hoped the crispy chicken was actually crispy.. Korean tacos .. did not taste like korean tacos. The bits of meat were gritty and had very loose flavors that did not resemble cooked korean bbq meat. Tortillas weren't good either.. SERVICE: Service was actually nice and polite, just that I thought that they were kind of overstaffed since there were so many floating waiters and waitresses around doing nothing.. causing them to talk with each other for an extended period of time when customers needed things.  ENVIRONMENT: Nice, clean, open, and good positioning of tables in the dining area.  Overall ... The food here is subpar. Period. There is some good flavors but they aren't accompanied with the right textures or presentation. There is nothing in the food here that makes me want to eat here again, especially with the price tag that comes along with it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rosemead?start=220,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003

We waited 2 hours for 10pm to roll around for happy hour. We came and then was informed that happy hour is only in the bar area. We were also informed that everyone had to be 21. We had one person out of 6 that was 20. We asked if we could still be sat at the bar cause our friend who was 20 would not have drank anyways. He was our DD. The waitress had the manager come over and he told us that we could not be sat at the bar even though our friend was not drinking. If that was the case, i dont understand why they restrict happy hour to just the bar. What about the people who would like to enjoy half off appetizers that are not 21?

Thanks for opening one here.  Came here twice in the last month. First time I ordered a chicken pasta, which was dry and not that tasty. I barely touched it.Took the whole thing home. My gf ordered the cheesy shrimp, which she said was too cheesy. Well maybe it's best for someone who is crazy about cheese. This was only a 3 star experience.  Came here again on XMAS day cuz everybody else decent was closed. My bf and I ordered the Spicy Craft Beer-Cheese Burger* and the jack daniel's burger. Both are juicy, fresh,and absolutely DELICIOUS!! I think the Jack Daniel's Burger has become my new fav burger replacing Red Robin's bonsai burger. I loved it! My bf also thoroughly enjoyed his spicy burger and that's saying a lot because I can't remember the last time he was happy with his burger. Our server was very genuinely nice and attentive. We left her a very nice tip. (Yes people leave some extra on a holiday, please. ) Oh..both times I ordered hot water with lemon and honey.

Food was alright-- nothing too spectacular nor was it the worse, just because I'm not a super fan of American food. However, there is always good deals here. Well, a lot -- like the 2 for $20 deal. Service was SPECTACULAR. This probably the reason for the five stars, (and extra tips when I was dinning).

While waiting, we had happy hour drinks and food at the bar which they kindly moved to our table once we sat down. The HH appetizers are good and worth the visit, but the TGIF's menu is uninspiring. I really couldn't decide on what to eat-- there are a lot of options and combos which made it a bit confusing.  I ended up getting a steak & ribs plate with a size of tomato & mozzarella salad and sweet potato fries. I asked for the steak medium rare, and I kid you not... it came out well done!! I'm not the type to send back my food because god knows what people do to food sent back to the kitchen -_- .... I ate it anyways because it at least tasted okay.... it's that darn Jack Daniel's sauce. Sickingly sweet sauce that tricks your tastebuds into liking everything!

As a chain restaurant, I think it's pretty bad to be out of something listed on your menu. Definitely room for improvement in terms of service too. You can tell the servers are new because there were a lot of ""i'm not sure, let me find out for you"" responses and our waitress kept mistaking me for the person sitting next to me and tried to make conversation by asking me a weird question about our ethnicitiy.

Services right now is a bit slow, looks like all the servers are in training and can't seem to remember anything you tell them but hey i love TGIF so I continue to come back. I think the best part about this location is they have Michael and Liana from the West Covina location working in the Bar again... Thank goodness!

Now normally five minutes is not bad, but there was no one else waiting and like 3 bartenders behind the bar.  The bar is huge by the way too.  Food was typical chain restaurant American fare, the waiters were very polite and friendly, and the atmosphere is loud with a mix of families and the drinking age crowd who like to ""party"" at TGIF's.  I was there with a group, so I didn't pick the place, and if I go back it will probably be under these circumstances too as I'm not really the TGIF type.  Hopefully their service improves and gets more streamlined.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rosemead?start=340,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.54,3.1600000000000006

It's a great and delicious place to eat.  After arriving, there was groups of people wait for tables. After putting down my name they asked for my phone number so that I can get notified via text when my table was ready. My first thought was such an amazingly techy place. I was able to walk around the plaza to look around before my table was called.  For the times I went, I tried the Cajun Shrimp Pasta, Baby Back Ribs, Skillet Garlic Shrimp. 2/3 of the items were good. The Cajun shrimp was as delicious as it looked. I highly recommend getting it if you want to stuff your face in pasta. My second choice is the Skillet Garlic Shrimp, which was filled with cheesy goodness that satisfied my appetite. As you can guess, the Baby Back Ribs were horribly dry and did not taste that great.  Overall, the food was good and service was okay. Nothing to complain about.

On my last visit, we were taken cared of by a gentlemen named Ryan, he was very courteous and accommodating, and  made sure to check up  on us for seconds all without being too pushy.

I was told that the garlic parmesan was worst.. i could only imagine.   I usually like to order their spinach flatbread, their loaded potato skins, loaded nacho skillets, and their red velvet cake.

We waited a fairly long time approx. 20 for our food, but we were fine with it. However, what I wasn't happy with was that once everyone in my table received their food, the server tells my boyfriend really late that they ran out of sirloin steak and are trying to get more. Then she later offered a complimentary chip and dip. Also she didn't even wait him to order thing else and asked if he could wait for it. Later she lied and said she's going on break but ended up having the assistant manager ""take care"" of us while she was working the other tables.  By the time his steak came (45 minutes later!!), everyone was done with their food and wanted to leave. Of course I called the manager if he could give a discount on his steak only because it was really unfair for him to eat alone while everyone is done. Apparently the manager wasn't in the office and I could tell the assistant manager didn't really want to give a discount but ended up doing so and took roughly 6 dollars off, which was fine. However he billed us for the free chip and dip. He took forever changing the bill and once he gave me the new bill, he looked me in the eye and told me ""Do not take the tip out on my waiters"". WTF?! Poor customer service and still wants me to tip well. Oh man... Food was mehh. Probably because I was heated most of the time.

121,ED L.,"Los Angeles, CA",928,716,2106.0,3.0,2013-03-03,"I have been to this TGIF's twice since it first opened late last year '12.  The food here is decent both times that I was here.  The first time we sat in the bar area for Happy Hour so we could watch the Lakers game while we chow down our food.  For Happy Hour, the specials is only served in the bar area.  The prices are not that expensive... so we ordered sliders, beef nachos, onion rings, buffalo wings, beer, and an Ultimate Electric Lemonade which was a lemon margarita with that fancy name.  The food came out after about 15 minutes which was a decent time. Everything was cooked nicely, and well presented.  The food  was full of flavor, and my favorite was the buffalo wings... simply because of the spicy kick it has in it.  The sliders were tiny but delicious with the meat cooked at medium well. The nachos and onion rings were just there to snack on, so it doesn't really matter.  The Ultimate Electric Lemonade was well mixed.  It's not that strong in terms of the alcohol content, and you could really taste the tangy lemon flavor with it's glass rim dipped in sugar.  I think I drank a couple of those lemonades because it was so good. So the first time, I was happy and pleasantly surprised.  The second time I went was totally a different story.  The waiters and waitresses was still very friendly.  The hostess on the other hand wanted to seat us on a table in the bar facing nothing but a dark corner.  I didn't think she was too bright or posses enough common sense  to do that because there was plenty of tables around the windows, and a few other empty tables around the bar.  I was with my parents who are older, and I am sure they won't want to sit in the bar!  Especially when it was a beautiful day.  I refused that table so she finally sat us in a more desirable location. Yes, everybody working there was very friendly and courteous to the customers.  Our waiter was probably still new.  I figured just by looking at him that he's still learning his position.  So I excused him for not being able to perform perfectly... especially when his cell phone went on.  But he was very respectful to my parents and he tried to be professional too. We started off with drinks.  Two raspberry iced teas and a coca cola.  No problem, he brought it over to us instantly.  He took our orders, and great... we could eat soon.  Guess what? our food did not arrive at our table until 45 minutes later.  The restaurant was well staffed, it was no longer that busy since the rush ended, but no food?!? The other people who sat down after us was already eating.   I was so irritated because of what happened.  I asked the waiter, and another waiter who wasn't the one serving us to check.  They finally brought out my order of Spinach Florentine... which is flat bread with cheese and spinach dip on top.  It was good though!  We waited again for another 10 minutes and the food finally came out.  An order of chicken pasta, an order of spaghetti, and my Jack Daniels Burger.  I must say the food was still very good! My burger was flavorful cooked medium, and JD sauce was served on the side.  The pasta dishes was also delicious.  The spaghetti sauce and white cream sauce went well with the pasta.  I think I will order that the next time I go. Anyhow, going back to the 45 minutes wait.  I was not happy.  I had to reschedule another appointment I had later the afternoon because of our long wait.  It was funny how the manager came out... per my request since the waiter asked if I wanted to talk to her.  Each of the waiters couldn't really explain why the food took so long.  The only said the cook in the back go sick and left without telling anybody.  So of course the manager had to say the same thing to keep the story consistent.   For me... I could careless what happens in the back kitchen, or who's (the employee) dysfunctional.  It is an internal problem that needs to be fixed quickly.  More importantly it happened on a Saturday.  I could just imagine the 45 minutes wait during a lunch hour on a weekday.  How can anybody explain the matter about being late going back to the office?   So please TGIF... take care of your internal problems.  This is not a good way to sustain your business even though it's so nicely remodeled inside.  Sure anybody could make up any excuse about the food part. Oh yeah, we ended up getting a free lunch from the manager.  But I felt bad for the waiter who really tried to serve us. So at least I still left a tip!  A weak 3 stars now because of my experience of their bad hair day.   But I will be back again... and hopefully it will be a better experience.  Especially if it is a business meeting lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rosemead?start=140,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.54,3.4000000000000004

I looked forward to a great meal since  there were so many people, but I was not impressed.  I came with my two kids, one who needs a high chair. When I spoke with the hostess I said, 4 people, as I was holding my little one year old. She put us down and said it would take 30-40 minutes. Ok, no problem. After waiting about 30-40 minutes we were walked over to our table. It was a booth without the ability to have a high chair. Great. So I was offered to wait for another table or take this table and they could give me a booster. I chose to get a booster. Then our waitress comes, takes our drink orders, one was a kids chocolate milk. Then another waitress comes, says she's our waitress and asks us for our drink order. We explained someone already helped us and the previous waitress comes up. They start going into some lame comedic routine about tables and competing and their laughing and smiling. I wasn't smiling. I felt like saying, ""shut up and get our order, I don't care who had the table, just take our order and go away.""  Anyway - out comes one of our mixed drinks and two sodas but no chocolate milk. According to the waitress the bartender has to mix the chocolate milk so it takes time. Really? Seriously? You can make a freaking mixed cocktail but you can't make a chocolate milk? What a joke.  In conclusion our food was ok, not great. I ordered the Jack Daniels grilled chicken plate with steamed broccoli and sweet potato fries. Nothing spectacular for the cost.

They literally tasted like chicken. Which isn't a bad thing.. I guess.. - Scorching Hot Wings with Bleu Cheese: These were my favorite. I'm a HUGE fan of heat, and although these weren't atomic, they passed the heat test (; Paired alongside the bleu cheese, these were to die for ! - Caribbean Rum Wings with Ranch: These were REALLY SWEET. My little brothers thought they tasted like apple pie because of the cinnamon that was in them. LOLL I don't know if I would ever order these again. - Nachos Grande: These weren't too bad.

Seeing this place recently opened and having a bunch of coupons, we decided to try this location. On a Saturday night, parking was hassle free and the wait was approximately 25 minutes. We didn't want to wait so we decided to sit in the bar area, which included not only the actual bar counter, but also the high-top tables and stools surrounding the bar. While we mulled over the menu, I heard someone greet us, ""Hey girls!"" and I quickly replied ""hi"" thinking it was our server. Looking up, it dawned on me this wasn't our server, as this person was a large middle-aged man, wearing a green athletic v-neck. The three of us -- my mom, sister, and I -- stared at him in silence as he creepily smiled at us, then told my sister that she shouldn't be wearing earbuds and listening to music as she's in the company of friends. We continued to stare in silence. He smiled again and made his way back to his table, right next to us. His family (?), a woman and a little boy, didn't notice a thing. It was so weird. Over the course of our meal, he would stare at my sister and smile at her. Before he and his family left, he came over to tell my mom what beautiful daughters she had. SO WEIRD. Now that I'm done ranting, I can start on the food. T.G.I.F.'s menu is quite extensive, and we decided to get two mains and a dessert to share. Salmon Langostino ($18.99) This tasty dish consisted of Norwegian salmon filet fire-grilled and topped with a sauté of langostino lobster and cremini mushrooms in a zesty roasted Alfredo sauce. We went with broccoli and baked potato as our sides. The baked potato was very large, which my mom enjoyed tremendously. Lobster Tails ($24.99) Two 4 oz. lobsters seemed like a really awesome deal but they were tiiiiiny. My mom had the steamed one and said it wasn't fresh and didn't like the random seasoning they put on it. However, mine was grilled, fresh, and tasty. Freshness and quality wasn't consistent, so I'm not sure if I'd ever order this again. For our sides, we chose another baked potato and tomato mozzarella salad, which was very fresh and appetizing. Ultimate Strawberry Shortcake ($5.99) Okay. So one of my favorite desserts is the Strawberry Shortcake from Dairy Queen, but they stopped making it at the location nearest me. It's been a couple of years and every so often, I get huge cravings for it, only to be met with sadness and disappointment that I can't get it anymore. Seeing this particular dessert on T.G.I.F's menu was such a beautiful moment for me because it's almost the exact same thing as DQ: pound cake, vanilla ice cream, and strawberry syrup. It was also huuuuge, served in a giant cocktail glass, and consisted of 3-4 ice cream scoops -- perfect to share among 3 girls. With our 25% off coupon, the total came to $41, including tax.

I'm sure TGI Friday is a common place for the majority of the people and their menu is laid out in their website.  The branch for this TGI Friday's provides great service and is not too busy whether it is weekday or weekend.  I've been here several times and so far their service or food have not disappoint me especially with consistency.   Recommendation/Favorites: [Appetizers]: Chips and dip, Cocktail (I find it a bit pricey on this), B.B.Q Chicken Flat bread, Bread Sticks (Good!!).  [Main Dish]: Chicken Pasta (I forgot what is the exact name but they also have this dish on the weekday $5 menu.  [Dessert]: Chocolate brownie with vanilla Ice Cream (I forgot the exact name).  [Drinks]: Strawberry Lemonade (there is an extra charge for refills).   Price: Same as every other American food restaurants.  Depending on the food you order, the price varies.  Although I feel the quality of the food is worth the price.  **Some Current Specials to Check Out** (Please recheck on prices or specials): They have the $5 - $7 menu with half off on dessert or appetizer  It is on the back of the menu and available at a certain time.  I know that it is only available on weekdays but I do not know the specific time.  I am usually there at lunch when I order the specials.   Service: Great service since it is an American restaurant.  Although I do wish they can add my rewards points to my member rather than giving me the receipt and telling me to bring the kept receipt next time so the points can be added in to my member.  (I usually don't remember bringing the receipt). Joining their Member:  They have this membership where you would receive points per receipt when you visit the restaurant.  It is free.  Just ask about their membership and their employee's will help you sign-up with provided information.  I think it's a good opportunity to save or eat more if TGI Friday's is a place to be visited often.  For every visit, just bring your member number or your membership card and show it to them for a free chips and dips and to add your received points towards your membership.  There are also possible discounts or coupons emailed to you if email is provided during sign-up.   Parking: It is in the Target/Bed Bath and Beyond Plaza, so plenty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rosemead?start=300,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.8640000000000003,3.1600000000000006

After debating with my family where we were we going for dinner we decided here *worst Sunday funday dinner idea :( * but since its happy hour all day every Sunday, we thought why not.  Sooooooo..... It's a group of 6 of us and one child. No the restaurant wasn't packed. As the waitress (Leticia) took our order we order drinks as well (two glasses of beer, a modelo, a blended margarita another on the rocks  a chocolate milk and a coke) we each ordered two appetizers expect my dad who ordered an entry. Oh and we ordered a soup and two salads which she offered to bring before the appetizers since that's what we were eating as dinner. Lets start with the drinks both margaritas were watered down bc the ice was melted the blended one was so melted you can see a later of water at the top of the drink. The beer look like someone drank out of them because there was no foam at top plus they were warm. Obv our drinks were sitting there for a while. And the coke and REGULAR milk were brought out 20 mins later.  After 30 mins our salads and soup come out.... With two orders of wings which were suppose to come out with everything else -.- then another order of wings come and they were the wrong ones. Instead of saying sorry, Leticia comes to the table and told my brother you said you wanted to try the boneless garlic parmesan it's on my pad. She opened it up and to HER surprise he ordered bone-in BBQ. Still no sorry...... Half of our table had food for about another 20 mins until finally the other plates came out. Still then we were missing an appetizer and when in came out 10 mins later it was cold -.- Not once did she ask us if we wanted anything else to drink. We asked for waters that took her 20 mins to bring out.  The table next to us had asked for an iced tea when she had brought it out for almost 20 mins they reminded Leticia and she said ""sorry the bar is backed up but ill bring that to you"" UM......

I was exited to find one near my home. My husband is a stripe member and he reached enough points to get a free entree. We waited to be seated, about 45 minutes. We agreed to that. No problem. We were seated and our waitress came within a reasonable amount of time given the crowd.    We placed our order, soup for me and the 2 for 10. A Reuben sandwich  for my husband. She took his stripe number and came back later to inform him that he gets chips and salsa. Some one else delivered our meal rather quickly, no soup, no chips, both of which should have come before the meal. She came back and asked was every thing OK. Then she asked my husband if I had received my soup. He told her no. She left and returned with the chips and salsa but not the soup. I told her  I did not want the soup. She apologized and told us she had removed it from our bill. My husband then ordered the fall spirit. It is a flight of four different flavors of whiskey. We were nearly done with our meal and we had not received our drink. I told my husband that if she did come back to check on us, have her remove that from our bill as well. She finally came back without the drink in hand and he asked her what happened. She said she was going to check. We waited another ten minutes before she brought the drinks. She gave us the tasting card with the description of each drink. As I work my way through the flight I noticed that I was not tasting what I should have been.They mixed up the order of the drinks. We finished the meal and the drinks and asked for the bill. We waited another ten minutes for it to arrive. The waitress was friendly. I am not sure why we had the issues we had with the soup. The drinks somewhat understandable, since it was Friday night and the Dodger's were in the play-offs, but she should have been checking on our drinks and food more often and letting us know what was going on. I was very disappointed because we used to frequent Friday's once a week when we lived in Georgia. Every time we go to Las Vegas, we go, so when we found it was closer we were excited.

Not crispy cause they are quite large in pieces, but very flavorful, I think it's both cheese and butter:P Petite Sirloin(2/5) A bit on the dry size, but it's not a steak house so didn't expect it to be great anyways. I had mine entree with sweet potato fries which are delicious and their chef's veggie selection, is not good at all. Yuck. Wedge Salad (3/5) interesting concept. But it's very hard to eat. I ended up chopping everything up so it tasted just like another salad. Not bad but I would go with normal salad next time. JD Burger (4/5) all the JD selection are generally delicious cause the sauce is pretty addicting. Burger is average, but the sauce made it awesome. seasoned fries are average as well. Chicken Brachutta Pasta (3/5) Not bad. The pasta sauce was yummy, but Im guessing they made a big batch and server it whenever someone orders it. Cause the pasta was luke warm. Chicken is dry like i expected, but really wish the pasta was hot. Food as in entree are average. But Food as in appetizer/ happy hour small bites, they are delicious and price make them even better.

Came here few times when it first opened and the foods was amazing and service was amazing. It was Friday night too when it was crowded. I think the management changed. So come a year later and it was Thursday night (not even dinner time) and service sucks so bad!!!!!!!!!!!! We waited literally an hour for our food to come out (which was fine if it was crowded or if the waiter acknowledged it and just told us straight up), which none happened.  So an hour into it and I got antsy and asked the waiter what was going on and he said ""Oh we're short staffed"" and I'm looking around to see like so many waiter/waitress standing around doing nothing. But I was still being nice and patient and figured they're probably short a cook or two. But then we were trying to get refilled on drinks and I lift my hands up so many times that it got so numb and tingling like I was gonna have a heart attack. Anyways the worst part was the end where I asked for the check. I'm not exaggerating with you guys and girls.  I had to wait 30 minutes and the waiter was just walking around like a chicken with it's head cut off, except he wasn't doing anything. So finally pushed comes to shove and I reached my boiling point and stood up and found the Manager who happened to be standing by the register flirting with another staff who's a busboy. At least she did apologize and took care of the matter right away so I didn't wanna yell at her. I didnt yell at the waiter either because he was a nice guy. Good thing he didn't have attitude or I will break some chinas (plates and glassess that is).

The second entree: $3 upgrade for the Petite Sirloin, mixed Veggies, & loaded baked potato.  Both our steaks were ordered Med...The steaks came out to Med Well. Melissa took our steaks back & had new ones fired up right away. The loaded baked potatoes were dressed in green onions not chives & no bacon. She did however brought us extra butter & sour cream. My mixed veggies were fresh not frozen, Al dente but lacked seasonings so I added butter, S&P. The onion rings were soggy. The steaks came  but it appeared the grill person rushed because the steaks came out burnt on the outside & med rare on the inside. Every bite was bitter & then the raw tasting on the inside.

368,Kevin L.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",349,617,215.0,3.0,2014-05-03,"Came in with some friends last night to catch up and grab a bite to eat. Compared to other TGI Friday's, I feel like this one was louder. It wasn't horrible, but noticeable. Service was good, nothing special or notable. Food was pretty good. Being a vegetarian (pretty recently, 4 months is recent right?), I was worried about my choices. I used to love anything from the Jack Daniel's menu and the last time I was in (December), I loved the new burgers. For whatever reason, my mind was set on a burger this time too. I knew I could substitute a black bean patty on any burger, but when I saw the Sonoma Black Bean burger, I was sold. Everything about this burger was right. Start with the bun, it was fluffy and perfect. They give you the standard onion, tomato, and lettuce. The onion was perfectly strong, just the way I like it. Everything else was good. They then top it with a pepper aioli of sorts. Spicy, but not distracting. Creamy, but with a kick. There was also avocado. There's no way you can go wrong with avocado. No. Way. Let's talk about the main event, the black bean patty. Burgers are what made me hesitant to adopt the vegetarian lifestyle. I love burgers and Boca patties are horrid. The three vegetarian black bean burgers I've had at different places so far have been incredible (Fuddrucker's, Mohawk Bend in Echo Park, and Rounds in Pasadena). Friday's is no different. The patty was delicious. Black beans mixed with spices and bell pepper and corn (I could be mistaken). The outside was crispy, the inside was tender. It wasn't at all like any beef patty I've had, but I love it all the same. I really like the flavor and texture of the patty, really good. Friday's has always had my favorite fries. They're salty, peppery, and perfectly crisp. Yum!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rosemead?start=420,3.0,2.96,2.96,2.316,2.9760000000000004

I hadn't been living in a city that had one in almost 10 years, so I was super excited that after moving to LA, I was able to talk my friend into driving 45 minutes with me to get it. When we arrived, we were seated, and ignored. After 20 minutes, i got up and complained to the host, and he found us our waitress. We recognized her as the woman who had walked past us and looked at us at least 6 times. She only had two other tables. It was not busy. She was just walking around bored. She took our order, and then took another 15 minutes to bring us our drinks, and didn't even take the menus. We were never given or offered refills, even though our drinks were empty for most of the meal. A different waitress ran our food out to us, and none of the sauces that we requested were present, and the fries were HARD as if they had been sitting out for about an hour. We complained about the fries, and she brought us new ones, and they were the same. I have had your fries a million times before. This is not how they are. They were gross. I asked if you had Au Jus sauce for my steak, and the waitress had no clue what it was, and then eventually brought me out some other sauce that was not even close to au jus and claimed that it was. I signed up for the rewards program to get a free appetizer, and finding her to get that was like pulling teeth. When we were finishing our meal, she came up to us, interrupted, and rushed us out, saying she needed to clock out, so we needed to pay now. I have been looking forward to this for years, and it was the worst service i have ever had in my life. I looked for the fridays website on google, and found a ton of other reviews for the same location that said the same thing. What's going on?! I hope that you can do something to make this better. Fridays used to hold a big space in my heart, and now I'm not sure I ever want to go back. I tried to submit this via the website, and kept getting an error message. It's disappointing that your site does not even function well enough to hear my complaint. ***UPDATE*** I originally posted this to facebook, and was told that I would get a call from a manager in 1 or 2 days, and no one even bothered to call me, and nothing was done to improve the situation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rosemead?start=340,2.84,2.93,2.93,2.052,2.894

I ordered steak and some shrimp along with a baked potato and coleslaw. Did I already state that the sides were SMALL? The small coleslaw that I ordered literally came in a tiny bowl that was probably 2 inches in diameter and height. There were only about 5 pieces of shrimp. The steak was about 6-7 inches, and lastly the baked potato was three quarters the size of the steak (~5 inches)... All for $20.

We went on a Friday night one day and the wait was too long for us so we ate at another restaurant. We went again on a Wednesday around 4 pm and it was not busy at all. We got seated right away.  It was five of us and we usually get a booth. However the host told us that in order to get the happy hour appetizers and drinks we had to sit around the bar. We ended up sitting on a regular high table which was a bit of an inconvenience for my parents. I don't see why you can't get happy hour appetizers when you sit on the regular tables?! But whatever.  Our server was really friendly which was a plus. He brought us our drinks fast and came by several times to make sure they were always full. Our food came out pretty fast as well, I'm sure it's because it was not busy. I got the Cajun shrimp pasta, it was delicious except for the shrimp, such a disappointment. The pasta itself was good, it also had pieces of chicken which was also good. The shrimp had a weird taste to it. My sister and dad got ribs and oh my they were DELICIOUS!! I will probably get that next time. My mom got a different pasta and she wasn't a big fan of it, I did not try it. My other sister got a burger and she said it was alright.

I highly recommend the spinach dip and the buffalo wings, that way you'd get your fair share for the price. Whenever we wanted to refill our orders or our drinks our waiter was who knows where. Had to wait almost ten minutes before we saw him again. At the end of the night, we paid the bill with about 20% of the bill left. Since service wasn't so great, we waited. Waited and waited. Finally about 15 minutes later our waiter comes back and actually asked ""oh did you want your change?"" Like, are you kidding me? Even if you believed you did great serving us, its still common sense to give us our change back. Second time we came here, we wanted to give it another chance so we decided to invite another couple for a double date. Food was good. Waitress was a helluva lot better than the waiter we had the first time.  Always checked up on our table. Refilled our drinks. There were only two problems I really had with this night. First was when I was walking to the restroom, another waitress was running like a madwoman to the kitchen and bumped into me and didn't apologize. Its common decency to do so but I just let it slide. Second was that service was quite slow, especially for a night that didn't have many customers. So, to summarize, two stars for food.

84,Christy M.,"San Gabriel, CA",1021,358,4411.0,3.0,2014-08-22,"For me, TGI Friday's was always a hit or a miss. The food today was pretty mediocre, in all honesty... overly salty, but our service was impeccable.  My brother walked in, anticipating to get their special AYCE $10 appetizer deal, but after looking through the menu I contemplated on just getting a sandwich, but opted out. Kinda regretted it, but oh well.  Stephany was our waitress, and she was very friendly with us, by greeting us with the warmest smile, and always very sincere whenever she talked to us. I decided to get the Boneless Buffalo Wings in Tennessee BBQ sauce as my first round, and my brother ordered the Loaded Potato Skins appetizers. At the time, we didn't know what we wanted, but Stephany gave us a bunch of recommendations of what were more popular amongst guests, and any specials going on at the time. She was more than just patient with us, but was understanding since we didn't know what to choose.  Some notes: AYCE Appetizers - $10/person. About 5-6 options to choose from. Parmesan Steak Fries - $3.99 The food did take some time to come out to us, which didn't make any sense, but no biggie. Right when Stephany brought us out our appetizers, she had immediately asked if we wanted to place another order since they did take a while to come out. And we thought it was great, because we thought we would have to wait forever again for round two. I chose the Garlic Parmesan as my next order, and my brother continued onto round two of his Loaded Potato Skins.  The Tennessee BBQ sauce on the boneless wings were delicious! I am usually pretty picky about sauces, since I tend to like it a bit more savory, than tangy and sweet... but these were great. Seasoning was perfect, and the chicken was actually pretty moist for our first round. The coating of the boneless wing was super thick as you can expect, but not as heavy as Buffalo Wild Wings. Thankfully, the thick coating didn't allow for a salty taste. It also came with a side of celery.  The Loaded Potato Skins are supposed to be one of the more popular appetizers at TGI Friday's, and these were our first time having them, but they were so greasy and overly crispy. The cheese tasted like imitation, like the cheese from a ritz cheese cracker... but even that's tastier. The bacon was okay, I didn't think ti was anything special. And it was served with a scallion sour cream sauce. I've heard good things about this, but felt like it fell short of execution. We didn't care much for them. The Garlic Parmesan Boneless Wings came out next, as well as the other round of Loaded Potato Skins. The style that TGI Friday's was similar to Wingstop's, The coating on these wings seemed a bit thicker, and the chicken came out dry. It was basically sitting in a wash of butter, and no parmesan.. boo. I definitely wouldn't order that again. Earlier during our first round, I had asked if I could switch out the celery for some carrots, and Stephany brought me a mound of baby carrots... score!  Lastly, came out the Classic Buffalo Boneless Wings. I like buffalo wings, but maybe it was because we were already full, that we couldn't really eat them anymore. I felt like te sauce was a bit too tangy though.  Also, our Parmesan Steak Fries came out last, since we did order it mid-way into our meal. Again, it seems like TGIF likes to drown their food in butter, since that's pretty much what it was. I paid $3.99 for steak fries... and it came out with 5 potato wedges sitting in butter, topped with some parmesan. For $3.99, I expected better.  Even if the food wasn't great, the service here was excellent. The host in the front was a younger male, and he was nice enough to open the doors for us, even if we haven't even came into the restaurant yet. I didn't catch his name, but he was very friendly with us, and even opened the door for us as we left. Stephany was great throughout our meal. She checked up on us a few times, refilling our drinks, and providing us with extra napkins without asking. For our food here, I would honestly give it 1-2 stars. But with our wonderful waitress, she is the reason I bumped up my star count. If it weren't for the service, I would've only given 1.

Came to this place with my sisters tonight. We ordered 2 orders of bone-in buffalo wings, 1 order of potato skins, 1 margarita, 1 long island iced tea to start off. The server came back 5 mins later and said that they RAN OUT of bone-in buffalo wings tonight and asked if we wanted something else instead so we opted for the boneless version. RIGHT after he took our entree order, a different guy came over with bone-in buffalo wings and potato skins but only dropped off buffalo wings. We didn't touch it since we were told that they ran out of it and  that it must belong to someone else's. The guy came back and said, ""oh, you guys didn't order this huh? took it and put down the potato skin. So I asked, ""So you guys still have bone-in buffalo wings?"" and he said ""yes"", ""but our server said you guys ran out of it?"", he didn't reply and looked around.  Our server ran up to him and said something to him and they went back to the kitchen. 5 minutes later the manager came out and said, ""the bone-in wings just came out of the oven"" ""I thought you guys ran out of it?"" ""yes, they just came out of the oven"" so I said, ""Ok"". Our server didn't come back AT ALL until we were ready for the check. So I confronted him: - ""so you guys have the bone-in wings now?"" and he said,  - ""yes, do you want to place an order now =} ?""  - ""why did you tell me that you guys ran out of the bone-in wings?""  - ""Well my manager already explained""  - ""We would've waited if you explained""  - ""We didn't have it at the time...I could get you some right now for free if you want"" - ""No thank you.""

We came here in a group of 4 hungry people around 10pm Saturday night. It was something close by and my friends recommended it. Service was horrible in my opinion. The waiter took our order and I went ahead and order first. Since it was happy hour time, I ordered the wings which was 50% off. Then the waiter mumbles something that if you wanted to order off the happy hour menu then we should have let him know or it will be full price..blah blah. Thinking back I can't even remember what he said because it was so  rudely explained. We didn't even get his name. Ok, then we didn't order the wings because it turned out that my friend ordered the hot wings. So I continued my order of chicken cobb salad and mozzarella sticks off the happy hour.  -mozzarella sticks, can't really complain about them because I'm sure they are frozen and its not that hard to heat them up. Hard to miss cooking this. this was actually good. It was so cheesy. I liked it.  -chicken cobb salad. They didn't bring me my ranch dressing. I had to wait for it like 15 mins and also trying to catch someone to bring it to me. Cobb salad wasn't even chopped up to pieces. It was just a lazy salad they throw the lettuce in and half ass chop up the cherry tomatoes, bacon was just cut in half and not even crumble and grilled the chicken was place it right on top with the egg and avocado. It was just OK for this salad.  -my friends shrimp cajun pasta looked pretty good. He says it was kinda spicy as you keep eating it.  -I tried my other friend's jack daniels burger.

That was probably a mistake.  We were smiling and friendly when we came through the door, but we were not greeted this way from our two hostess. It was strange because the hostess didn't seem like they knew what they were doing. We were finally sat after an awkward conversation involving how many people we had in our party.  We were not impressed by the service. We had a total of 3 different waiters before our food was on our table. The servers were informing us they were leaving because of how slow it is was, and I understand that. I too work in food and beverage, and I have worked in this industry for several years so I understand completely. What I don't understand is the reason why we kept getting servers that were transferring tabs to each other, but they were leaving as well. With that being said our waitresses really didn't check on us. It wasn't busy, so where was our 3rd waiter? The food was delicious! I ordered the ribs and my boyfriend ordered a burger. The mashed potato side for my dinner came with cheese on top; I can't have cheese. I asked our 2nd and 3rd servers about it, and they told me they would bring me out a separate side dish of mashed potatoes. My mashed potatoes came out and they were hot and amazing! It all tasted magnificent! Kudos to the chef(s)!  I asked our 1st waitress what she recommended on alcoholic beverages, and she was having a hard time figuring out what the drink was called and what was in it. =\ I ordered what she recommended and it tasted great but, I was expecting a bit of a buzz. I hadn't had food all day, and I drank my entire drink before my food and I felt nothing. I wasted some money, but at least I tried it. It was quite easy to pay for our food, but that seems like that's always the case in restaurants. Haha. We payed through the tablet that's placed on all of the tables. It also included a percentage on tipping, if you would like to tip. Nice touch. Of course we tipped, but we weren't sure WHO to tip and WHO the tip went to.  We also noticed the hostess at the front door was holding the door open for people exiting and entering the establishment. I mentioned before we left, ""If they don't hold the door open for us, then something isn't right here."" And low and behold as we were walking out, the hostess didn't hold the door open for us.

However, what wasn't acceptable was the fact that he barely gave us any attention at all. We were seated near the kitchen and my friend and I had both noticed our food had came out already. He and I watched as our server walked in and out of the kitchen, occasionally chit chatting with another server. Later, after he saw us, he then said, let me check on your food.

There was a small confusing with one of our orders though.  One of the food runners thought our green beans were mozzarella sticks so we didn't take it.  After about 10 minutes we were wondering where our green beans were.  After we told our server he brought them out immediately and told us the confusion.  They probably sat out for those 10 minutes but oh well.

That was one of the first things that I disliked, second she never really checked up on how I was doing with refills or if I needed anything, third I had to order some other side dish that I normally do not get because their deep fryer was not working.

It was a twenty minute wait but we found a bar top in the bar area to have a drink and some food. Our waitress was friendly and had good suggestions when we asked about things on the menu. We placed our drink order and some appetizers. For appetizers we had Sriracha buffalo wings.  Sriracha wings - they we ok. No difference from regular wings. They did say there was an extra little kick but really didn't get the kick. We also asked the person who brought our wings out for some blue cheese and that took forever. We had to ask another waitress to get it. I was expecting something different it they taste like basic buffalo wings.  For our main course my wife ordered the Cobb salad and I had there 10 oz new your steak medium rare.  Cobb salad - very disappointing and to be hones it looked like an incomplete said. In the words of my wife ""what a sad salad"". It looked like a bunch of lettuce and not much of anything else. I told my wife to ask for extras to add to that salad but she didn't want to.  NY steak - was not how it was described. The steak was described as. Ewing cooked with spices and topped with a type of butter. Well let me tell you it was nothing like that. I think they have me the wrong steak. It was cooked medium rare how I wanted it but had a sweet glaze over it like when you order a jack Daniels stake that they advertise but that's not what I ordered nor wanted, But I didn't complain and ate it anyways.  I do have to say when we got the dressing for our buffalo wings my wife dipped her wing and took a bite of the wing ending up with a piece of plastic in her mouth. We believe it was from the bag they cut open to get some blue cheese dressing. We brought it up to the waitress and she got the manager.

The greens and salad itself were excellent except for the chicken.  It was clearly overcooked, tasteless and HARD. I ended up pushing it aside, and unfortunately was never asked how it was.  Then again, the greens were good.  Making it 70% OK. I also ordered some baby back ribs to go for my guy at home. The menu said they came with fries.    I did not think to check the order before leaving, but on arrival at home  the fries were not with the order.   So, kind of a B- experience tonight, although NORMALLY they do everything right.  I like the service staff and atmosphere and patrons.   I can get over some crummy chicken, but I sure got some grief over bringing home a ribs with no fries.

244,Mike B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,2016-12-08,"Man, so few nights I get to spend time with my sister and watch a Kings game. Tonight we went here to have a couple drinks and watch the game, the raiders game was on so obviously that gets priority and we don't mind, but initially after asking to have the hockey game on just one TV there was some pushback from the manager, Jose, eventually it was put on. Our waitress, Priscilla was PHENOMENAL, always checking up on us and making sure we were good, and everything was, until we asked her, AFTER the Raiders game was over, to put the Kings game on one of the main bar TV's that was more visible to us and to play the audio from the Kings game. She went to ask and came back to inform us that unfortunately the manager wouldn't do it. I asked to speak with him. He came by our table and after i asked him again he said ""yeah, that's not gonna happen."" I was astonished, paying customers cant have the audio from a live sports game? The Raiders fans have left,  we had listened to 15 minutes of post NFL game commercial and now there was just bad top 40 music playing. I explained this to him and then he firmly stated ""Not happening, it's up to the people here and no one wants to hear the Kings game, I could cut you off if that's a problem."" Really?!? I had only 2 beers and made a simple request. I said ""That's fine, you're being a douchebag."" He then hovered around our table as I discussed how stupid this was with my sister and girlfriend. Next thing I see, one of the main TVs switch to the Kings game and the audio plays. Look it there, people migrate to that side of the bar to watch the game and they order more drinks. He then comes and tells me ""Sorry we got it going, it's all up to the bartender."" Jose, are you the manager or are you below the bartenders in the hierarchy here? Is it the bartenders decision or is it only if more people request to hear the game? Next time, if someone makes a request, take care of the customer. If someone complains, kindly inform the customer that there were complaints and they had to change the audio, don't shut down the customer right away. This guy, Jose, completely ruined the evening. He needs to be removed from his position, given some customer service training, and re-interviewed to see if he truly qualifies for this job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rosemead?start=280,2.24,2.66,2.748,1.956,2.492

When he showed up, he said if we want a table we have to wait, but no waiting for the bar seating. Because we were not there to drink but for lunch, we waited for about 5 minutes. Turned out, so many empty tables available. WTH? We thought they had a full house or something! Then come the bad service ever in an American restaurant. After our waitress, S***h, asked what for a drink (water). We saw her back & forth bringing food & drink to other tables & completely forgot about ours, this another 10 minutes. After I made eye contact, she brought the water. Then when we were ready to order, we had to wait again for her to show up, 10 minutes. Meanwhile, other patrons that were seated after us already enjoyed their meals. We got our meal, mini size of Salmon that doesn't warrant the full price.  Good thing, we got a discount from being a member.  We needed spoons & turned on the device that blinking red light to call server. A bunch of servers passed by, not looking. Finally, after about 3 minutes our waitress showed up. Then when we were ready to pay, we turned on the blinking light again. Our waitress was busy talking to a colleague at another table. The Waiting game again, another 5 minutes gone. Surprisingly for service that almost none like that, they have the gut to ask for minimum 18% percent tip.

From the moment we walked in, to the moment we left...we were treated with the utmost respect and dignity.. Andrea our waitress was fantastic. She was very aware of our needs and made sure we were taken care of.. At one point we asked her a question on the menu and though she wasn't quite sure of the answer, she did not hesitate to call another team member (Ricardo) who was more than willing to offer up some help.. She could have just said the typical ""I dont know""..but she didn't and I was glad that she was able to feel comfortable and confident to ask another team member for his opinion...after all isnt that what team work is all about?. Mike (who was not our waiter) also was kind enough to bring us things we needed and informed us about Happy Hour and the house specials and he was just as friendly and helpful as Ricardo and Andrea.. One person I must point out above all was the manager Jose. He came over to our table introduced himself and answered any questions we had.. We told him that it was my fiance's first time there and he went above and beyond to make sure that we not only had a great experience but that we would also come back in the future...and let me tell you, he has earned two life time customers..

But the server was really nice and friendly. I would probably only go here for their appetizers.  And the person who seated us needs to learn how to build customer interpersonal relationship.

116,Vinh D.,"Alhambra, Los Angeles, CA",103,101,20.0,1.0,2017-06-08,"TGIF! Terrible NBA VIEWING EXPERIENCE My review is from a sport fan, specifically pertaining to basketball but this can easily be applied for a football fan, baseball fan... magic card the gathering (sport? Despite ESPN SHOWING THEM DANG GAMES). ---------------------------- My two advices to any sport fans to heed before attending the TGIF in Rosemead is such: 1) arrive 60-90 minutes before the pre-game analysis for good seating 2) the bar is the best seating area for two reasons: the most televisions count and it's the only area where sound is broadcasted along with picture.   Personal note: opposite appeal, it would be nice to have argument with the wifey with only pictures and no sound.  TIP: stock up on a good blinding eye mask ---------------------------- We arrived to TGIF in Rosemead 25 minutes before the tip off of 2017 NBA Finals between Warriors vs Cavaliers, game three.  I scouted the bar area for self seating availability; alas, none was available. I proceeded to signed in with the reception for seating. The process was swift and efficient from a time stand point. This will be the one and only positive comment I have to say about TGIF receptionist. I semi got my request because they did seat me nearby a TV, my dissatisfaction stems from the fact the TV didn't work  Glitches and technical issues happen and can be understandable.  I reached out to the server, who was attentive and helpful, to redeem the situation and get the game on the TV most nearby me. She was the only person in the TGIF that provided attentive service and cared for my urgency to see the game.  But regrettable she was fighting a collective tide of I-Don't-Give-A-Matt-Barnes (Google Matt Barnes, the epitome of sportsman conduct, clean player) among the TGIF staff. I reached out to the receptionist for a different seating arrangement with a view of the game, they said they were too busy today and there was nothing they can do. I felt it was more of a lack of will to help than circumstance.  I watched game 2 here. My experience with game 3 is as pleasant as a casting call with Bill Cosby  I will not patron this TGIF spot for game 4. And if this series goes to 7 games, I am hoping on my DIRECTV account on my MacBook Pro and heading to Starbucks within the same Plaza to enjoy the game and a triple shot, 2 pumps of classic over 2% milk because non-fat was my pre marryin-SENTENCE choice. Man, Starbucks was a BETTER place to watch a sport game than TGIF's. A sport bar and restaurant losing to a coffee shop to view a game is as ridiculous as candidate winning the popular vote to being denied something important, like the presidency.  Ridiculous, huh? Not possible right? ---------------------------- That dark experience thankfully ended with me at a Starbucks to witness a good 2nd half in a scrappy, competitive contest for the W in game 3. In short, Rosemead Starbucks came thru in a clutch! KD came through in a clutch. TGIF came through with I-Don't-Give-A-Dcuk",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rosemead,2.84,2.65,2.704,2.084,2.726

They refilled one glass and didn't bother with the others, Had to ask to please fill them again and not one and walk away to talk to friends, When we finally received the bill it was wrong. We were charged for things not ordered. We were also charged for some kid kiosk. I asked what it was and it is for games on some of the tables. I pointed out that we did not use this and in fact did not even have one our our table. Why are we charged for something that we were not even offered.

If they advertise on TV that Margaritas are $3 it doesn't necessarily mean that's even in the state of California it could be in New York restaurants that is what the waitress told us. A television commercial said $10 all you can eat appetizer but when we got here that's when things got real complicated. It's $10 per person and you can't share between two people but I can understand that. What I have trouble understanding is that certain appetizers on the list don't come in full orders so they break them into half orders and you have to choose a different one not just the one appetizer you want. I don't understand. Don't know why they have to make it complicated.   That may put a video game screen on the cable and don't explain to my wife and I would exactly that is. Turns out it is a video game player that is $2 for unlimited play if you have a child they wants to play.

57,Vanessa J.,"El Monte, CA",111,25,7.0,3.0,2017-10-01,"I'm conflicted on what rating to give to this place cause the service was great, but food wasn't great. I personally think its overpriced. I would rather go to outback or wood ranch for the price. We got seated right away but it did take awhile to order drinks. But after that our server Monique was on top of everything. Her service alone I would come back. Some of the meat was dry, the sliders, and chicken fingers from the (kids meal) was very dry and blan. And I asked for complimentary chips and salsa due to being a Fridays rewards member and the server rang it in for the $2 price, she ended up removing it off the bill but I felt that was over priced at just $2. It was like maybe 7 chips on the plate. Aside from that the server was good and the Oreo Madness dessert is amazing!!! I would come back and eat only that!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rosemead?start=20,2.56,2.57,2.704,3.2120000000000006,2.566

As I am still recovering from a fun night at Dave & Busters at Arcadia. My friend Lawrence called me up and said hey David do you want to grab a bite to eat? And I said sure why not? Let's do this!!! 2. I feel special that my friend invited me to dinner. It was the first time that anyone has done that for me!!! 3. As we arrived there. It was pretty crowded with the Dodgers game going on and Sunday NFL games. But we still got to sit at the bar and watch the Dodgers game and also the Sunday NFL Games. 4. Lastly for now. We ordered a pasta and also a basket of fries. I recalled that we had three orders of basket of fries.  PS I will most definately be back here now that they have trivia night every Tuesday night starting at 7pm to 10pm!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rosemead,2.88,2.59,2.748,,2.7059999999999995

42,Nicole P.,"Long Beach, CA",0,2,,1.0,2017-11-29,"This place has extremely rude staff from the get go at least from the moment I got there. No one sat me down, I had to find someone. Then they shut everything down at 11:30 when they close at 12:30. They rushed their customers to eat /last call an hour early. That's insane and rude. I asked the waiter why and he said because ""they need to be out"" by 12:30.  In any business/restaurant there is absolutely no way they can be done and cleaned up at the time the  guest walks out. The restaurant closes at 12:30 so basically they will deny customers because it's an inconvenience for them.  They burnt my food and the waiter attempted to argue with me over what I always order ( I know what a skillet is), just a horrible rude place and I'll never return to this establishment again. Long Beach is better.  I will be calling the main Manager to inform him of this horrible service.  They turned the lights on and music off an hour early. When the waiter brought me out my food, the ""skillet"" was sloppy with the food looking horrible and no pepper, the chicken had no seasoning. It was obvious they didn't try and were just to consumed in to going home.  2 minutes later the waiter asked if I wanted my water to go!!!

118,Ryle B.,"Glendale, CA",1,5,,5.0,2017-12-04,"Been going here for years with the fam and things never fail whenever we wanna catch dinner here. However, tonight (December 3rd 2017), things just felt a little different. We ordered the same thing as usual but there was just something wrong with our food. Well mine and my moms.  Our ribs weren't as hot as it was supposed to and mine was just really hard and not even close to being tender. Our waitress, I forgot her name, tried her best to take care of us and when she heard that I couldn't eat my entree, she immediately took it out of my hands and said she would change w/o any change of moods. During that time I was impressed that she didn't mind and once she gave me a new rack it just so happened To have the same texture but just hotter. At this point I just lost my appetite and told my parents that like it's fine and just u know to-go it I guess but my mom hit the girl up and she asked if I wanted anything else to replace it but I decided to just not eat anymore. We ask for the check and as soon as we get it, the waitress gives us the check and a new set of ribs on the house!  You know I'm obviously delighted by her gesture and the managements and I just want to thank them some how for knowing how to take care of their customers. The ribs were as tender as I used to get it !! So yeah, shoutouts to our waitress, idk who you are but you worked on a Sunday night from 8pm - 9pm ish and you did ur job wonderfully!
