HAPPY HOUR HAPPY HOUR!  Great prices (half off some appetizers) and cheap drafts.  My favorite appetizer is the hot wings (bone in) of course.  You get like ten wings for 5 bucks.  You can barely buy at that price uncooked at your favorite supermarket.  Happy hour runs from 3PM to 7PM Mon-Fri. Give ol Friday's a chance people.  I know many people missed the franchise when they went out of business.  Everything takes time to smooth out the wrinkles.  I too have experienced longer than usual wait on food the couple times I have been most recently, but so far the staff have been very nice at the bar and door.

Came on a Thursday night and sat in the bar area (not knowing Happy Hour was about to start).. the waitress carded us and one of our friends didnt have an ID so she tried to escort us out of the bar area and on to the other side of the restaurant.. seriously??? we asked to speak with her manager and she copped attitude with up and we all caught her rolling her eyes.  RUDE. After we spoke to the manager, we were able to stay in our seats but left with the waitress-with-the-attitude. Clearly there were 4 of us in the table... why did she only give us 2 menus???? and clearly not all of us were ready to order, but yet she took one order and OF COURSE, one of our friend's food came out early. she never gave refills even though she offered and she also never gave us utensils... we had to chase down a few other employees just so we can start eating our food. happy hour is retarded. there are way better happy hour menus around the area. they dont even have a separate menu for their happy hour... our waitress had to look at the regular menu and let us know which appetizers were included o_0 My friend and I ordered the same exact plate (chicken and shrimp pasta) and his came out wayyyy spicier than mine.

121,Denise D.,"Roseville, CA",12,4,,1.0,2012-05-24,"I have to agree with the other low ratings.  To sum up, had to ask for utensils and napkins, our waitperson disappeared (never saw her again) after our food was delivered. We sat on the patio because it was nice outside.  We never once were offered a refill, mainly because our waitperson never came back. We had to beg for our check from some other waiter who happened to be walking by and likely saw me looking around for somebody (Anybody!). He said he would find our waitress, she never showed but he came back about 15 minutes later with our check. I didn't want him to ""get away"" so I had already gotten my credit card out so I can hand it right to him before he disappeared. He took my credit card and the check back inside and lo and behold, about another 10 minutes later, a new waitress brought it back with her apologies. She said that someone had ""transferred"" our table to her (the 1st waitress had gone home), but no one told her that she was taking over our table.  We NEVER saw a manager, or anyone who looked like one.  There was one guy wearing a different color shirt (it was grey, not the usual TGIF red), but he didn't make any eye contact with anyone. Lastly, the patio was filthy.  There were tables that sat without getting cleaned up from the time we arrived until we left an hour and fifteen minutes later. Some poor kid who looked very young and inexperienced (not a waiter, but he was the one who originally walked us out to the patio), came out and poked around one of the tables, picking up one or two glasses and taking them into the restaurant. Then he came back out and picked up a to-go box someone left behind and then carried that one item into the restaurant.  Then he just seemed to give up and disappeared.  There seems to be no one assigned to cleaning tables and no managerial oversight whatsoever.   We were excited so see the restaurant re-open and provide some badly needed new jobs, but at this rate, they better get their act together as there is plenty of competition in Roseville.  Why put up with this when you have BJ's, Yard House, Red Robin, Mimi's, etc, etc. within less than 1/4 mile away?  In this economy, it is a treat go spend a little money and dine out.  Why waste it on a bad experience?  The management needs to get it together or get replaced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-roseville-roseville?start=120,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002

The food was great the drinks were cold and served promptly especially for being so busy.  I give the staff at Fridays a lot of credit it is never easy to open a large restaurant and they seemed to be coming along quickly with service and food quality.  My guess is that all of the other posters have been masters of their  professions in just a few days... So sorry but it does take some time to become proficient in anything you undertake whether it is food service or carpentry you can't master it overnight.  It is always easy to be critical when one only sees what is on the surface.  Fridays has only been open for 10 days and it is my opinion that they will be just fine once the staff gets a little more experience.  I will be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-roseville-roseville?start=100,2.1,2.1,2.1,2.1,2.1

We happened to go during late night happy hour. It was priced pretty well. Some of the appetizers were half off, some beers were $3, and $2 off mixed drinks.

95,Kelly L.,"Yuba City, CA",55,146,4.0,1.0,2012-11-03,"We walked in Sunday night for dinner, and ended up walking right out. There is basically no waiting area and really no hostess station at the front, so when I first walked in, I really didn't know what I was supposed to do. I thought maybe we came in the wrong entrance, but it was the front door. Do we seat ourselves or...?  So we waited there for at least five minutes before being ""greeted"" with a rushed ""have you been helped?"" Um, I don't know, how about a ""Welcome to Friday's, have you been helped?"" or ""Welcome to Friday's, where would you like to be seated?"" with a smile or even a remote amount of enthusiasm. Apparently working at Friday's must be pretty bad times, huh?  Anyway, during our initial wait, I had a chance to glance around and see that there were numerous empty tables, so I thought we would be seated quickly, especially as a party of two. No dice. The hostess told us the wait for a table would be at least 25 minutes, but that we could pick a spot in the bar and eat. So, I took the pager and we kind of stood by the door for a minute. Then we decided we'd just go ahead and sit in the bar to eat and watch a game. As I handed the pager back to her and told her we'd rather go ahead and eat in there, she stated we could only sit and wait in there, but not order anything because there was no wait staff. So I said ""Huh? That makes no sense,"" and laughed. We left and ate at On The Border, where they have an idea of what customer service really is.

Used to be able to dine for 2 for around $25 and take home left overs. Now, dine for 2 around $40+ and scrape every bite to get a meal. Funny thing is they use the same large plates so the meals actually look dinky now. Couple other things, we always ask to sit away from the bar area to eat a peaceful meal but the music still blasts way to loud over the booths.

For example, on our last visit, just a few days ago, the food was superb.  The service from our waitress Kelly, who has served us before, was spot on great.  It was a very nice experience.  On our visit prior to that, the service was dandy, but my blue cheese burger was as dry as a bone, well-well done.  I had ordered it medium rare.  When our waiter asked if my burger was medium rare and I showed him a dark gray rubbery mass, he was visibly horrified.  He offered to replace it with one cooked properly, but I declined, preferring to dine at the same time as my spouse rather than us eating in shifts.  Besides, we've all heard those stories about upset cooks seeking revenge on folks who send food back to the kitchen.  You know; spitting on the vittles, etcetera.   I wouldn't take the risk.   The two star rating reflects more than the above described experience.  I can recall two other bad visits to the new Friday's, including a  really pathetic Club Sandwich, and one time where we were forgotten by a waitress and sat endlessly in restaurant purgatory, waiting and waiting and waiting.   In short, this place is wildly inconsistent.   Great sometimes, terrible sometimes.   One more point.  Friday's was always known for its contrived ambiance of all kinds of  interesting, neat-o things hanging from the walls and ceiling.  Stuff like old signs, beat up catcher's mitts, and black and white photos of folks like Ernest Hemingway.    This new Friday's in Roseville has almost none to those effects.  Like the restaurant on the moon, there's no atmosphere. I suppose we'll give this place a few more tries, based on previous years of satisfaction with Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-roseville-roseville?start=60,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.44,2.0

The last time we were here, we found a long blonde hair in our fried mozzarella. Not sure if it was in the marinara sauce or the mozzarella stick.  It was about a month since that happened. On this last visit, I had a coupon for $5 off for $15 or more from the Entertainment coupon book. We had ordered three entrees, two appetizers, three mixed drinks and a soda. What I also have is the Fridays phone app, you can earn rewards good towards food, drinks and dessert. I have racked up a bunch of rewards and haven't used any of it, I looked through my rewards and I had a coupon for $8 towards food. When our bill came, I showed the server both coupons and I knew he would tell me I couldn't use both but i thought it wouldn't hurt to ask, and when he said I could use only one, I opted to use the coupon for $8. I write the serial number for the coupon off my phone and he walks back and tells me the manager said that we couldn't use it because two of our dinners were the Pick 2 for $10 entrees. I was confused because the reward was good for any food purchase? I then told him how about the $5 coupon from the Entertainment book and he says, I already ran your card through. WTH? I was annoyed. On top of that, I lost my rewards points for the $8 coupon, because it shows that it's been redeemed.  I was a bit disappointed but I thought, why??? The last few times we've come here we've had either bad food or bad service.  To sum it up, there are a lot of better dining choices than to waste your time and money here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-roseville-roseville,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.404,2.0

59,Kat Z.,"Sacramento, CA",2,12,5.0,1.0,2013-11-23,I love TGI Friday's...it's one of my favorite places to go...the main reason why I love it so much is because of the jack Daniel's chicken...it's soooo very yummy...its amazing and wonderful. The food was great on this last visit...just what I was expecting...super yummy and exactly what it is suppose to taste like. However the service I received was a whole different story... We were seated very quick after arriving so that was nice...it was a Wednesday night so they were not very busy. Then we get to our table and at first the waiter seemed okay...but then... When we were eating and having a conversation (because that's what people go out to eat for...to eat and talk) the damn waiter kept interrupting our conversation over and over again...for lame crap to..and he kept pushing us to get desert. Listen if I want to eat deserts then I will...leave me to enjoy my dinner and talk...go away! So after having to deal with this damn guy all through out our dinner...it was time to go...we had enough. Now on to the next topic...having a rewards program. So I have a rewards card and when you earn enough point you get to pick a reward...well the only reward that I could use with the meals we pick was a $8 off one...so I pulled up the code on my phone and gave it to the damn waiter and he wrote it down and left. Then he comes back with our bill....I look at it and said you didn't put the $8 off code in...and he said ummm yeah I have to do it later...I said no when I hand you my card you you will hand me with a bill for the correct amount...other wise you will end up charging me more. So he said okay I'll go take care of it...I say fine I'm going to the restroom. When I'm walking out of the restroom he stops me and says....ugh ummm the code doesn't work...I said maybe you wrote it down wrong...and gave him the code again. So really it wasn't that you have to put the code in later...really it didn't work most likely because you wrote the code down wrong....and you were what...thinking I'm as dumb as you and wouldn't notice. Ugh so finally it all get taken care of and he brings the bill and walks off. I waited for maybe 1 minute...and he doesn't come back. So I get up and go to the little register booth and handed my bill and money to a different waitress who was nice and took care of it. Then we left...it was the worst experience I have ever had here. Every other time...it's great...food is good...service is good...but this time not so much. So I say if you are going to go here and the try to seat you in Dylan's section say NO please move me...he was terrible!

I wasn't about to sit near the shitter just to eat at a damn Fridays, so we find other seats and ask for menus. Immediately the server comes over and gets drinks going, I think she was offended that we didn't want drinks. WE saw they had a special and had to search the smaller table side menu to find the deal that should have been told to us when we first got the menus. Then the fried blonde server insists (I mean reaches over and changes pages) on showing me the 500 calorie menu ( okay she tried it!!) and then tried to cover it up by saying ""what would you want that for your fine"".

It took about 10 minutes for her to even acknowledge us, even though we were one of 4 couples there around 6PM on a weeknight. I will say their 1/2 off appetizers are worth it - would i ever pay full price for these? NOPE, but for 1/2 off they were worth it - especially the chicken finger things and the potato skins! The food was decent - we also ordered some of their small platters, though I'd say some are not worth it - they taste like they are previously frozen, not freshly made.  But the reason for the 3-star review - the service just sucks. Only 1 person and it may/may not be her fault, but have more employees who are more attentive.

I ordered a mojito because she said they make them fresh  and muddle the mint themselves. Oh and by the way she was also the bartender. Mind you when she brought it to me. It looked very  foggy as if the mix was wrong. I tasted it anyways to choke down a whole mint leaf from the bottom of the glass. I moved the straw and all the whole leaves floated up. She didn't muddle it at all. She just through the mint in the glass and served it. :( I thought well I will just order something she can't goof up. I ordered a coke, and she brought me a diet coke. LMAO , it never seems to amaze me, I always have the Best or the worst service no matter where I go. Wish for just once I could have the average server. I'm not asking for a miracle, but don't get mad if the food is messed up and your customer asks for something different. ~ This was not a good wexperience in customer service.

131,Jennifer R.,"Sacramento, CA",0,11,,1.0,2015-03-17,"Worst dining experience EVER. The service was terrible and Dylan, the ""manager,"" is a hot headed, power tripping creep.  We got there about 7pm. Got appetizers about 7:30. Entrees served about 8. They forgot my kid's food. I reminded them. At 8:10, his food was still not there. At 8:15, the server came and apologized and made an excuse about having ""four tables,"" and promised it would be only 3-5 minutes. I asked for some fries or something to hold my child over in the meantime and she refused. My other kid vomited at the table and I took him to the bathroom to clean him up. I came out at 8:25, he still had no food. I packed my family up and informed the hostess that we were leaving because it was unacceptable for them to leave a 5 year old hungry while everyone else around him ate. I informed her that my food was also still there, because I couldn't eat in front of my hungry child. She apologized and said she understood. As we were buckling the kids in the car, Dylan came out yelling at us and telling us that he would be calling the cops on us for leaving without paying. When I told him that the service was unacceptable, he made excuses about the server being new and having a lot of tables (4 is apparently too many?). He said their policy is that customers have to speak with a manager. Well, I don't know their policy, and the hostess never asked us to stick around and talk to him. He said the server also never informed him that we were upset, and that sometimes they try ""be sneaky"" and not get the manager involved. Sounds like they have a serious personnel issue. Long story short, he told me they would ""eat the bill"" and that I could just leave. I asked him to confirm that he would not be calling the police and his response was, ""We'll make a decision about that later after I call my general manager."" Excuse me? Like I'm going to drive away and have you accuse me of theft?! I demanded that he call his general manager right away and instead, he did call the cops! I had to wait there in the cold with my 5 year old crying because he was hungry and scared and wanted to go home and my 1 year old freezing because he had no clothes on (because he puked on them). When they arrived, the officer I spoke with agreed that there is no excuse for lousy service. I told him that I would gladly pay for the one person's meal that got eaten, but not for mine or the one we never got. Apparently Dylan told the other officer that they would write if off, but that I'm not welcome there ever again. No worries, Dylan, sweetie... You couldn't pay me to come back if that's the way that you treat your customers. Now it's after 9pm and my poor kid STILL hasn't eaten. You should be ashamed of yourself for subjecting my children to that spectacle and for wasting two patrol cars worth of police officer's time when I'm sure they had much more important things to attend to.
