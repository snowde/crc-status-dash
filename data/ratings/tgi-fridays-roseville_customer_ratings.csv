2,Kristin C.,"Carmichael, CA",1,16,,4.0,2015-02-21,"I find it funny that people have posted this place/location as closed... Um its not.  I've been there as recently as TONIGHT... still going strong.  I've only had an ""issue"" one time in the many times I've been there & that was a server who sorta ignored our table - as in, our drinks were gone and we were still there wanting more. So yeah.  Other than that the food is standard TGIF, staff is friendly & funny.   my only real complaint is that there are only two locations in ""sacramento"" (ELk Grove & Roseville) - I live in Carmichael, and was sad to see the Howe ave location shut down years ago.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-roseville,,,,,
