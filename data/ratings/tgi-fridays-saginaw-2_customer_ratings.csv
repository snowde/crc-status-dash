18,Mitch L.,"Bridgeport, MI",2,45,3.0,2.0,2012-07-27,"SLOW SLOW SLOW! I've been here 3 times over the last few months and no matter how few people there are it takes a very long time to get your food. Appetizers take 20 minutes or more. You finish those. Wait. Plates taken away. Wait wait. Drinks refilled. Wait. Then food shows up. Nothing amazing, but good. Expect an hour and a half to two hours to take a lunch here. One other complaint on a previous visit. They wouldn't give me tarter sauce. I asked for some but couldn't have any because they had changed their menu and didn't have tarter sauce any more. Do you have a pickle? Do you have mayo? Make me some freaking tarter sauce.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saginaw-2,,,,,
20,Caleb E.,"Frankenmuth, MI",19,37,4.0,4.0,2013-01-18,"I usually only sit in the bar, so this review will be somewhat biased to that area.  Service has always been extremely prompt and personable.  The bartenders always go out of their way to service their customers.  The high def tv's are always tuned in to the wings or lions games.  The noise level is kept under control, lighting isn't overpowering, and the drinks and food are always good.  It can get busy at times, but what restaurant next to a mall doesn't? Highly recommend the korean tacos with a tall glass of cab or a pint of guinness!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saginaw-2?start=20,,,,,
19,Paul D.,"San Diego, CA",1,8,2.0,3.0,2014-07-29,"I should know better. Friday's is Friday's.   Tiny salad soaked in enough dressing to flood the bottom of the salad bowl.  No separate salad fork.  Even though I tried to leave it on my salad bowl to be picked up, I was told to keep it for the entree  the lobster was a pleasant surprise and my steak was adequate.    The bar staff was pretty good and overall, its what I expect from Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saginaw-2,,,,,
15,Luna Christine S.,"Lubbock, TX",7,9,,2.0,2015-06-13,"There's no ""thanking god it's Friday"" when you come here for dinner.  First, it had been awhile since our last visit and the prices have skyrocketed since then.  It was because of a ""$5 off $20 or more bill"" that brought us there so we ordered.  The three of us ordered the soup of the day - the clam chowder. When it arrived, it was cold! I sent it back, thinking a minute in the microwave would be all it took to make it edible. Fifteen minutes later a manager came by to explain that they had run out (of the soup of the day?!) and had to take another batch out of the freezer. He assured me they were working on it as fast as possible. Ten minutes later, our entrees arrived. No soup.  The menu's photo of the Pecan Chicken Salad looked infinitely better than it tasted. The Sizzling Steak & Spinach that was to be served on a bed of mushrooms, spinach and yellow squash was very hot; too bad they couldn't have done similar with their soups. But there wasn't even a whole mushroom there - simply two thin slices.  In the end, i took home my hot soup and all our soups were comped plus the manager gave us a coupon for a free appetizer or dessert so i guess we will have to come back. Ugh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saginaw-2,,,,,
17,John V.,"Mount Pleasant, MI",0,8,,4.0,2016-02-17,"Great place to go for lunch or dinner.  We always sit in the bar area since it has a fun atmosphere and the servers are way better than if you sit in the dining area.  The bartenders are friendly and do a great job.  We've been here for all sorts of occasions and always have a good time.  They took away the juke box a while back, and I must say, is one of the reasons we don't go back as often now.  Minus the juke box negative, it's still a great place to go hang out with friends and grab a drink.  Right next ot the mall and close by the new movie theater.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saginaw-2,,,,,
16,John D.,"Davison, MI",0,25,4.0,1.0,2016-03-19,"Slow service, loud rap music playing and servers on their cell phones constantly.   Diet coke never refilled,  bathroom was gross and other people were upset as well.   We werent allowed to orde endless appetizers because the kitchen closes in an hour.  Slow slow slow. ...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saginaw-2,,,,,
13,Brooke V.,"Wayne, MI",59,18,6.0,3.0,2016-09-05,"Friendly staff, good food, over priced on some items (not the locations fault but corporate). Made sure my boyfriends steak was cooked right before they left the table. Would recommend",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saginaw-2,,,,,
6,Ron S.,"Freeland, MI",1,57,34.0,2.0,2016-12-17,"Typical TGI's, corporate chain type of place. They hit you hard with upsell drink pitches.  Ordered the mozzarella stick app & the $10 rack of ribs special. The mozz sticks were underdone, took bites out of 2 of them, and left the rest. Bartender just asked if I needed a box - nothing about how I barely touched them.  Ribs came, looked good. Fries and the slaw were good, but the ribs were underdone as well - far from ""fall off the bone"" as advertised in the menu. But, it was 10 bucks. If it was full price ($20) I would have been pissed.  I do like the JD glaze, the beers were cold, and about average for a tall domestic draft ($5) I could take it or leave it here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saginaw-2,,,,,
4,Karlie S.,"Franklin, MI",43,34,9.0,1.0,2017-01-13,"Sorry, not sorry. But unless you plan on eating nothing but cheese sticks don't come here. I odered beer cheese and pretzels $8. The cheese got hard after 5 minutes, even after our waitress told me it would not.  Next I got there lunch deal with a avacado BLT.  Such not what I expected. The bread was stale, bacon had been made hours if not days before. There was no avacado and the sandwitch was cold.  Cheese sticks were great thou, that's why they get the 1 star. Get the app tray with 8 of them, great deal.  Fries were also not bad. Seasoning was as yummy as ever, could use a little crispness thou. Over all, staff was amazing and ended up taking care of my bill. Thank you for that, but I don't think I'll be coming back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saginaw-2,,,,,
9,Edie L.,"Lancaster, OH",0,3,,5.0,2017-02-01,I had the Mahi Mahi with tomato and mozzarella salad and broccoli.  Food was delicious and served quickly.  Portions were just  right. Server Justin was friendly and accommodating.  I heard him helping out a couple searching for furniture and he was so kind and polite.  Nice place to dine near the hotel strip.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saginaw-2,,,,,
10,Tim K.,"Burton, MI",19,2,,1.0,2017-02-27,"Went on a Sunday night with a group of around 12. No one else in the building besides us and maybe a few others at the bar. Everyone at our table got the unlimited appetizers and the waiter had us order a lineup of 4-5 apps we were going to want. After spending close to 3 hours there closing time had hit and we had only gotten 3 appetizers. We were averaging around a plate an hour. You would think since we were the only ones in the building the service would be a bit faster , but instead the staff decided to work as if they did not want to be there and wanted to milk the clock until closing time. There seemed to be no urgency, especially for us all ordering appetizers which should be the quickest things to make on the whole menu.  Overall: very slow staff and unlimited apps seem like a good idea, until the time spent there waiting to get your food becomes unbearable , making you wish you just went to Applebee's half off apps instead, because the plates come out faster than an average of one an hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saginaw-2,,,,,
14,Angel V.,"Saginaw, MI",0,3,,4.0,2017-03-13,"Let's just say .. endless apps are amazing! Mozzarella sticks are to die for, waitor was great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saginaw-2,,,,,
12,Annie Z.,"Reese, MI",0,159,,1.0,2017-03-27,"So bummed out with my experience here. After seeing the ads for the unlimited apps, we had to try the place out.  I ordered the unlimited apps, which, the way it was explained to me, I could order 2 or 3 apps at a time, all would be served at once, and if I wanted, I could order more. My husband got a chicken Alfredo dish.  Quickly after we ordered, one plate of apps arrived. I asked the girl (who wasn't our waiter, she was just a server) where my other two apps were that I ordered. She said they can only serve one app at a time. Not a big deal as I was certain the next app would be here as soon as I finished the first. I ate it and waited. And waited. In the mean time, my husbands meal arrived. I asked the server, again, not our waiter, if my apps would be coming soon. She said she'd have to check. She never came back and our waiter was nowhere to be found.  15 minutes goes by and my husband is finished with his meal. He's sitting, waiting, and ready to go and I'm still waiting for the second plate of my apps.  FINALLY, my second plate arrives, with double the amount of wings because they were sorry it took so long. However, the wings weren't what I ordered. Still hungry, I ate them anyway with my husband's help. When I finished those, the next app that I ordered came in a decent time.  By now we have been at this restaurant for over an hour. By the time we got our bill and a half-assed apology from our waiter who didn't seem to care what was going on, we were there for over an hour and a half. The concept of the unlimited apps is great, but the way they are doing it is so bad. Food was decent, but the lack of service just ruins the place for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saginaw-2,,,,,
2,Rod W.,"Oakley, MI",4,164,187.0,3.0,2017-04-02,"We arrived here after the early morning rush but before the night rush. The place was maybe 1/4 full. The service was good, I never did get my refill on water but the sodas were refilled. The menu was typical and the prices were average. Our waitress asked what side we wanted however failed to mention there was an up charge for some side items. I guess we should have asked. The unlimited appetizers were for $10 a person but we went with the safe option of burgers. Our burgers were good. The fries were heavily salted and lost some taste as a result. The buffalo burger they used chicken wings with a bone in. My son said they were good but he was hoping for boneless so he could put them directly on his burger. All in all an average visit. This place is worth a shot. We did not get any alcohol drinks however these appeared to be expensive .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saginaw-2,,,,,
7,Lindsey S.,"Saginaw, MI",0,28,,3.0,2017-04-25,"Just no. Nothing special. It took forever for our appetizers and lunches to come out. I tried the strawberry salad, which had about three strawberries on it. Everyone else in our group seemed to have mediocre food, as well. Try Harvey's down the street instead. Same price but much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saginaw-2,,,,,
11,Tom M.,"Saginaw, MI",11,3,,1.0,2017-05-08,"ordered endless apps for my son, boneless according to him were really good, second order of them and order of fried pickles..... longest wait I think i've ever waited for. the burger I had was supposed to be med rare, got tired of waiting for waitress, ate my raw burger. beer was warm. to top things off, gift card came from my bank thru Tgi friday, 10cents on a 50.00 gift card. ?waiting for up to three days for a response. It supposedly was used just recently used. may,huh? in my wallet since November and have not stepped foot in restaurant in 2 years!  DONT THINK I WILL BE BACK. oh put one star because you have to have a star to post.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saginaw-2,,,,,
3,Thomas B.,"Grand Blanc, MI",23,209,53.0,4.0,2017-07-15,I wish we had this chain in the Flint area.    Brighton or Saginaw are both a bit of a drive.   I do enjoy the variety of the menu.  I had a wonderful salad and some awesome sliders and my wife ate salmon.  We both enjoyed what we ordered and the service was very attentive on a slow Sunday afternoon.   We would for sure visit again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saginaw-2,,,,,
8,Randy H.,"Sebewaing, MI",0,7,,3.0,2017-08-26,"I used to go here quite regularly but I haven't been here in over a year and now I know why. The food is alright but drink prices are absolutely ridiculous. 2 glasses of wine costs me $25.00!  If I ever go back, I won't be ordering any drinks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saginaw-2,,,,,
0,Amy B.,"Rochester, MI",547,1181,306.0,4.0,2017-09-07,"I haven't been to a TGI Fridays in ages.  I came here because I really didn't have the energy to find anywhere else to go, and it's close to my hotel. Plus, I guess I'm overdue for a visit here, so why not. I came in and the place wasn't busy at all. I was seated right away and scoured the menu for something off the appetizer menu. I was hungry, but not starving.  I ended up getting the two sliders and they were really good. I wish I would have gotten 3 sliders, but I was fine with two. My server was really cool and made the trip here worth it. Plus, when I got the bill, I got the happy hour price. I'm lovin it!  Place is still the same in many ways as I remember it, and I'm glad I stopped in here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saginaw-2,,,,,
5,Steve L.,"Saginaw, MI",42,8,3.0,2.0,2017-10-15,"This place was ridiculous tonite. First let me say it's Sunday and the place was not busy at all but yet, they messed up our food 3 times. We ordered the nachos for an appetizer with jalapeños on the side because I don't like them. They bring them out and they are on the nachos. We send them back and then wait almost 20 minutes for new ones and the new ones come out with jalapeños on them also. So we say never mind we don't want them. We get our food and I ordered mac n cheese instead of fries but sure enough I get fries with my food. So we ask for the manager. She was very nice and remade the nachos and didnt charge us for them. She got me my mac n cheese also. Meanwhile the waitress never brought us a refill until the manager scolded her. So we were very disappointed tonite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saginaw-2,,,,,
1,Chelsea D.,"Bay City, MI",1,6,,2.0,2017-11-05,Horrible service and mediocre food. Went on a Saturday night at dinner time so I did expect it to be busy and have to wait a little bit but not at as long as we actually did. We got seated and waited almost 15 minutes to even meet our server and get drinks. After ordering our drinks we had to wait almost another 15 minutes for our server to take our order. We ordered an appetizer and our meals. Our appetizer took a very long time to come to our table. The chips were to salty and very greasy. Their guacamole is just smashed avocados and onion and nothing else. From the time our appetizer was served until we got our actual meal it was almost a 45 minutes wait. When we did get our food my chicken was burnt on the bottom and plated like they tried to hide it and my broccoli was over seasoned. My boyfriends burger was over cooked and dry and the lettuce on his burger was wilted and turning brown. Our server didn't check on us at all and didn't give me a refill on my drink until a manager told her too. Our server had three other tables around us to serve as well and only checked on one table at a time. She would driver one tables food and then walk away without checking on any other table. It took another 15 minutes to receive our Check and to get my change back. The server also asked me if I even wanted change back. Will not be returning. I've never spent almost 2 hours inside a restaurant before.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saginaw-2,,,,,
