8,Dino L.,"West Chicago, IL",2,16,,5.0,2012-01-27,We have always had a pleasant visit at this Fridays.  All of the staff has been friendly and the food is very good.  Amanda was our server and she was very friendly and polite.  We'll definitely visit here again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saint-charles,,,,,
10,Comensal A.,"Chicago, IL",0,366,,3.0,2012-04-04,"We visited Friday's for a family lunch. Each of the 3 generations found something tasty. We were in a booth and the noise was tolerable. Our server, Kerry, had just the right vibe to deal with everyone. The menu has enough variety for timid diners and sophisticates alike, the wine list is nice, and the prices are reasonable. A nice place for a variety of tastes...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saint-charles,,,,,
2,Rita B.,"Schaumburg, IL",22,150,31.0,1.0,2012-09-12,"This has got to be the WORST Friday's I've ever been to. I should have kept driving past the empty parking lot but decided that since I love Fridays it couldn't be so bad. Boy, I was wrong! Our server was horrible. She was rushed and kind of rude. She's not even my issue...the food is the issue.  Food was overcooked, tripled fried, cold, gross and had no taste/flavor. Mom had to send her burger back because it wasn't cooked well. The second burger was over-cooked and seasoned with so much salt and pepper that she had to scrape it off with a knife. Neither one of us was able to eat our dishes. Best part was that we still got charged for it after complaining. It has to be really bad in order for me to complain so this should give you an idea why the restaurant was empty.  Needless to say, I will NOT be returning to this location ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saint-charles,,,,,
0,Sonya M.,"Chicago, IL",107,384,343.0,3.0,2013-02-03,Guess everyone in St. Charles is in bed by midnight because this location was dead as a door nail when I stopped in early one Sunday morning. There was one server on duty & the bartender. Don't recall their names but they super friendly & gave prompt service. I had the tiki torch Margarita & a the balsamic chicken Ceasar salad. The Margarita was awesome! The bartender on duty was obviously good at her job. Can't say I was in love with the salad but that had more to do with the twist with the dressing & less to do with the freshness or taste.  The brownie was good too but a little too rich for my liking.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saint-charles,,,,,
1,John S.,"Aurora, IL",126,438,5.0,2.0,2013-07-08,Lets face it Fridays is what it is. Food here isn't great or freshly made but you know what you are getting. If it wasn't for the pick two deals I wouldn't bother eating here at all. They charge $7 for a order of mediocre cheese stix which is just crazy for what you get. However the pick 2 for $10 is a great deal. Can get a burger and cheese stix for $10. Crazy to not get the burger for the extra $3. Food at this location is ok and about the same as any other Fridays.  My boyfriend ordered a steak rare and it came well done. Our server was very friendly and had no problems taking it back. Service at this location was much better then other Fridays I have been to. Over all if in the area and have to have Fridays food this location has great service. From a food standpoint you are better off at most other restaurants...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saint-charles,,,,,
7,Joseph P.,"Saint Charles, IL",4,74,2.0,4.0,2013-07-25,We have gone here several times and always enjoyed it. Food is always good and the service is great. Went today and our server Chris and the manager treated us very well! We would recommend this place and we plan on going again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saint-charles,,,,,
6,Brent A.,"West Chicago, IL",89,137,71.0,3.0,2013-11-21,Fridays seems to have slipped a bit since I have had dinner here last.  Both my steak and my daughters were cooked til completely gray while ordered medium rare.   They did re cook them. Much better the second time? But it took a long time. My dad was done with his dinner before I got mine right.  I know mistakes happen but if you screwed up the first time can you at least put a rush on the re order   The waitress was a bit slow too and didn't bring or offer a glass for my dad's bottle of beer.  When we asked for a glass she came back and said they are out of glasses right now.  Really?   The lat few times I have been here was for appetizers at the bar and that was good.  So maybe Fridays needs to stick to drinks and apps and let the dinner people go elsewhere,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saint-charles,,,,,
4,Mark L.,"St. Charles, IL",8,8,17.0,4.0,2014-03-19,"We go weekly, service is always good, manager is friendly.. Food is always hot and plenty of it on your plate.. Well run, with no bar brats hanging around being noisy . Good place to watch a hockey game, baseball and football, be nice at times if you could here the play by play, but the volume is always off. Bar service is good, and food comes out fast every time.. Best Fridays we've been to, nice to have it in our back yard..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saint-charles,,,,,
5,Christian H.,"South Elgin, IL",4,16,4.0,3.0,2014-05-25,Great buffalo wings! There food is fairly decent and the restaurant environment is very family oriented and a great place for group event!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saint-charles,,,,,
3,Kevin S.,"Winfield, IL",44,178,127.0,2.0,2014-10-11,"Why do they advertise endless apps by you can't share? Also I got sick from the buffalo wings, which ruined my girlfriend and I planned date-night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saint-charles,,,,,
