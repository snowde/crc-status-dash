36,Tricia N.,"Austin, TX",232,95,7.0,3.0,2012-04-15,"Writing reviews for chain restaurants is pretty gross, but I am going to make an exception here. I ended up here after the original Greek restaurant I had picked out closed at 8 PM and I needed to pick something quickly that an out of town business guest would be able to navigate to (SA highways, you are very unkind). Though I was immediately grossed out at the prospect of eating here, I was pleasantly surprised by both the service and the quality of my salad. There were a lot of people partying it up in the bar (there's not a lot to do on this side of town), so perhaps next time I'll go and get sh*tfaced with my husband.

I am not a huge fan of Friday's, but my coworkers enjoy coming here for lunch every now and then, therefore I tag along. There's usually hardly anyone in the restaurant as early as we go (11am). This is not the worst Fridays EVER, although the other reviews certainly suggest it is. I'm happy with it overall. Cheyenne is a wonderful bartender/server. She's friendly, happy, and very attentive. We sit at the bar because we really enjoy dining with her. I am picky about my order; I ask for sauces on the side and no bun, substitutions and all. They've never messed it up. The food comes out promptly. Our beers are refilled and so far the food has been consistent. I like their Sedona black bean burger. All of the employees are really friendly. The door is opened on your way in, and of course the bar service is good.

Appetizers took 45 minutes.. rest of the food took over an hour and management never came to apologize or even mention it. Our bill took 30 minutes to get after being wrong the first time. Talked to manager and he was defensive and said he would adjust the bill. He made us wait 15 minutes before bringing us back a bill that was about $40 higher. Waited another 15 minutes and he came back with a bill adjusted by $12 from my bill that was over $100 and only $4 for my brother in-laws bill. I can only assume that he was messing with us and being facetious. Worst service ever. Bad management. I had the bleu bacon burger and it was dried out and cold.

Our server Latifa checked up on us only to get our orders, didn't refill any drinks the entire time, didn't ask if our food was okay, and at one point smelled of cigarette.

She didn't understand the menu- their for didn't understand what we were asking. She had to go to the bartender several times to ask questions. We were the ONLY table inside and a margarita took forever to be placed and/or made. The food took more than 25 min to be executed and expo. I usually don't make a big deal about things like this, but we were the only table inside and our order was not difficult.  When one person complained about a side and asked to have it replaced with a different side- she charged him for the side. The food- is horrible. I'm not sure if they over prep their food and that's why it taste bad, or if it's because the recipes are not being executed properly , or if the recipes are meant to actually taste this bad. The rice tasted sour, old, and mushy. The meatballs were grey! The pork tacos was old- the corn tortilla was stale. The pork had no seasoning.  I don't Blame the staff foh or kitchen. I blame the management here. He rather sit and be friendly with his staff instead of being concerned about the guest that are their experience and how his store is running. We clearly were not happy and not once did he make an effort to try to make our negative experience into a positive experience.  Working in this field,any kind of bad review was a training tool to help the restaurant succeed and become better.

I am writing this review for people who come in from out of town and can't decide where to eat.

I started eating the spinach last and on my third bite felt a sharp pain in my mouth, I thought I had broken a tooth. I reached into my mouth and pulled out a piece of metal about the size of a staple covered in grime and could immediately taste blood. I calmly asked for the waiter and he asked if he could see it to show his boss. He comes back to the front later and is joking with the hostess before coming back to my table and explaining that it must be from the wire brush they use to clean the grill when they make ribs and such. I explained that while that was an interesting story what was it doing imbedded in the spinach?!? He said ""Oh yea it must've gotten in that"", my party and I were left in shock and that was the last we saw of anyone before they brought the check. I would think a manager would want to come speak to a patron who had just bit into a nasty piece of metal but I guess only a death in the restaurant would warrant his appearance from on high. I was in my work uniform so I did not flip out as I wanted to but rest assured I am contacting the health board and code compliance to file a complaint on the ineptitude of the cooks and management.

60,Erik T.,"Kingwood, Houston, TX",8,5,,1.0,2016-01-14,"I'm normally like TGI Friday... It took over an hour for us to get out seats with minimal people there. We noticed several tables were open from where the waiting area was. Once we finally got our table and we were seated it took another 20 mins before someone came over to get our drink order. We were all trying desperately to order our food because God only knew when we'd see our waitress again. She came back with our drinks shortly thereafter and began taking orders for food. My plate was by far the worst of everyone at my table. My pasta looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for about 3 days. The pasta was hard, dry, and had like 4 shrimp. My kids didn't eat their chicken tenders because they told me after our meal that just really weird. My kids are not picky eaters either. When my boy doesn't want to eat something it's because it's either rotten or it just got pooped on basically. The meal was over, my family and I were all desperate to get out of there before we saw any rats or bugs scurry out of the kitchen. I decided to use the restroom and noticed there was no soap. So I can only imagine how many plates of food were cooked with dirty hands. Disgusted and horrified at this point I just wanted to leave. We had to wait an additional 30 mins for our dessert after we had to order initially wait 15 mins, and then wait another 15 mins because she came back and asked ""Did you want that to go or for here?"" We had had already stated the first time that we wanted it to go when we ordered the dessert the first time after our meals were done. Then we get home and of course the dessert order was wrong. Ordered a whiskey cake and got a brownie instead. I guess that's what i get for trusting them they would've made right on all the previous mistakes. If you feel like complaining to the manager the whole night I'm sure you'll get good service because he seems to be the only employee there who actually gives a crap about quality service.

The bathroom floor tried to keep my flip flops. It's gross. I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like.  2. Our server did not listen at all to our order. He came back and ""double checked"" and still managed to give us the wrong food. Then when we asked him to fix the bill (twice), he didn't. He just handed us the ticket and walked away.  3. It wasn't busy and the process of placing the order, getting refills, and getting our check took way too long. Now that girl at the bar was pretty but flirting is not a job. If you want to flirt, at least get my order right and refill my husband's water. Water is free. Always refill water. That's server 101.  4. My chicken was pink.

Bad experience overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-antonio?start=20,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

15,Amanda A.,"San Antonio, TX",0,19,15.0,3.0,2017-05-03,"Hadn't been to this location in awhile so my boyfriend and I decided try it out again. We were greeted and sat at a booth. The table was a bit sticky, the wall connected to the booth looked like food had been splattered and never cleaned up. We were greeted by our waiter John. He was very nice and patient with our ordering. He'd always made sure our drinks were filled and checked to see if we were doing okay. I had no issues at all with john, just to be clear. The food was average, I ordered the endless wing appetizer and they were okay. My boyfriend got the chicken and cheese plate, he seemed to enjoy it but too much for him to finish. Overall the customer service was great but very average food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-antonio,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
5,Jaime R.,"San Antonio, TX",10,18,,3.0,2017-05-28,"My wife, mother and I felt like a light late lunch early dinner and since I had never been to a TGIFriday's my wife recommended it since she had been to many in New England. I will have to say the host was quick in seating us and it was a good location due to the fact that my mother is in a wheel chair. They accommodated quickly to her; however, not soo much for my 6 month old daughter. I asked for a high chair and one never came even though it was right by the host stand and then I did get one my self and the strap was broken so I got another one all while the host watched. We did get a server named Myriah and she was prompt in the beginning and brought us our drinks promptly and they were good. We all quickly noticed however we didn't have any napkins or silverware. I would have asked my server for some but she was MIA for a good 10-15 min. I don't know if she had another section on the other side of the restaurant or what. I finally saw another server on a high top table rolling silverware so I asked if I could have some and a few extra napkins. I was informed reason being we didn't have any silver was due to none being rolled.  The server took our order and when asked what soup was best didn't really have an opinion since she stated she didn't like soup. We had 2 salads and my mom had the 1/2 rack of ribs. The restaurant got 3 stars due to the food. The food was above average for a chain restaurant and the ribs were absolutely great according to my mom tender and juicy and fell off the bone. The service is really the only thing I would have to say needs to be improved. The décor may be a little dated but it isn't horrible reminds me of an older Ruby Tuesday's. All in all it is ok. I may give it another shot because of the food. I just hope the service gets better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-antonio,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
6,Amanda B.,"Tucson, AZ",2,18,3.0,2.0,2017-05-28,"I love love love Friday's. Coming from the east coast where it's really popular, this location doesn't disappoint in terms of the food. It's the same flavor and value that's expected from any Friday's.  The reason for the low rating is due to the astounding lack of professionalism that we witnessed at this location. We sat in the bar area, and saw a few of the servers huddled by the kitchen window. They were all on their phones, using profanity, and seemed utterly oblivious to the fact that customers were within earshot. Then, the manager came out and asked the employees about whether or not another employee called out or didn't show up to work a couple of days ago. Her tone was so unprofessional. It sounded as though she was gossiping about the employee. The manager then sat down at the bar several feet away, took out her phone, and was chatting with some of their servers as though there were no customers around. I couldn't believe it. Throughout the rest of our meal, the manager hung out with the servers, and they continued to use their phones, use profanity, and essentially ignore the entire bar area.  Thankfully the bartender was pretty attentive and we didn't have any issues with our meal or anything like that. But the servers and the manager were so unprofessional that it was super uncomfortable for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-antonio,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
68,Conswelo G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,4,,1.0,2017-06-03,"Goodness where do I start. A 20 to 30 min wait time, and an additional 30 mins on your food order. You have to ask for additional napkins condiments, etc and lets pray your glass will get refilled in a timely manner. Their tortilla chips and salsa are drenched in cooking oil so be prepared for exiting to the bathroom. The only reason I even entertain going back there is because my daughter loves their baby back rib meals. Their chicken Cesar salad sucked horribly and was so tart that I had to repair it when I got home for having a decent meal because I did not want to cook. This meal was not worth the $40 spent.  I have had better buffet salads.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-antonio?start=20,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
