Spinach Dip was delicious. Our entrees were delicious too. I had the chicken pasta and hubby had chicken and shrimp pasta... At least until he found a hair cooked nicely into one of his pieces of chicken. We sent the dish back- and over came the manager. No sincerity- it seemed protocol. He proceeded to let us know his cooks wear hairnets and hats, so he was not sure how this could have happened... But said he didn't doubt our word.  They offered to make another plate...

We made the mistake of dining at Friday's last night because it was the only place we could find open. They're open until 1:30AM for food, so you can ingest nastiness well into the night! Methinks that if you eat this stuff at midnight and then go to sleep, you deserve whatever happens next. How bad can it be, right? A buffalo chicken sandwich and some cole slaw. If they had actually made it last night and not last week it probably would have been okay. Seriously, it was barely edible. The service was also awful and it was really pricy, too.

I upgraded to the jack daniels chicken and shrimp and I wish i didn't spend that extra $5 immediately after I tried it. Fries tasted like they were reheated from early in the day. Not crispy at all! The mashed potatoes had no taste. Chicken and shrimp was nothing special at all. My girlfriend had the pasta and it was super bland. Service was forgettable.

It's a chain restaurant. The reason this place get's a good rating from me is because the service is great, they are open until 2AM everyday with HH specials all of the time, and they have Karaoke Mondays. There are also a ton of good looking people if you come after 10 on any given day.  There's not a lot of places to go late at night in the Carmel Mountain area unless you want to chill it at Micky D's, but that could get a little boring. Trust me, I would know.

Last week I went with some friends, and the dude who helped us totally gave off the vibe that he didn't want to be there. He didn't smile at all and he came by once to ""check"" up on us. The food was alright.  Yesterday my cousins and I came here after watching a movie, and I saw the same dude who helped us last week. I was hoping that we wouldn't get him, and we didn't. Unfortunately we ended up getting homegirl D.   D drops off the food, gives us water, then that's it. The food was the same average TGIF ""quality"" I got last time. We came to the conclusion that D was having a horrible day. I mean, what waitress checks up on her homies only when she drops off the food, then later on, drops off the check? Maybe she wanted all four of our water glasses to be completely empty before she refilled them. She's a friend to the ocean. Seriously though, there weren't even that many people to serve that night. I don't think I've ever experienced crap service until last night.  The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because I've had some chill experiences here before.

We usually go to the UTC Friday's for the late night happy hour and we have never had any problems there. But last night we just decided to stay local, what a huge mistake. The Long Islands are on happy hour for 5 bucks and we always get them with cranberry as the mixer; apparently when you ask for cranberry you are getting a 'Long Beach' and there is apparently shnopps added? Even though I couldn't taste anything remotely close to a shnopp, sure, whatever.... But then you don't tell us that the 'Long Beach's' are not on special and in fact 8 dollars when you bring our check? Real trashy move on the Friday's end. We get that same drink in UTC with no questions asked and its still on happy hour. So this might have just been a mix up or miscommunication; but it really seemed intentional by our waiter (Mike) trying to possibly charge us more.. Even though we showed up right at 10 for the happy hour specials; I guess they assumed I showed up at 10 to in fact pay full for drinks? Doesn't that completely defeat the purpose of showing up for a happy hour? I know this may be a complicated situation compared to your normal brain load at Friday's; but it's actually really simple. We showed up at happy hour, for happy hour.... what a crazy concept. To top it off you brought my girl a water without her or any of us even asking; assuming we were drunk.

The restaurant wasn't ""slammed"" by any means at 10:15 or so, and we ended up being a revenue-generating group--at least 25 of us!  The waitress was rude and angry because ""I don't know where these drinks go because you all MOVED.,"" I believe were her words...We told her if it was too difficult, we'd be happy to leave and go to another restaurant.

At the end, the bills came. My husband got a bill for something we didn't eat on it, as well as 2 glasses of wine we never ordered (not even the kind I was drinking.) I got a bill for a drink I ALSO never ordered, and 2 others had bills with items on them that they didn't have. We got most of it fixed, and paid the exact price on the tab.  Corporate should REALLY be visiting this store. I can't imagine why some of their wait staff still have JOBS in the service and ""people"" industry!

The most glaring thing is that this place is LOUD! Anywhere you sit in the restaurant, it's very difficult to hear even the person sitting next to you. The last Friday's I went to was the same, so it must be just the way the chain wants it to be. Maybe it's more exciting...? The food wasn't very good either. We got the Jack Daniels appetizer of baby back ribs, fried shrimp, and something that tasted like Orange Chicken. The baby back ribs were very dry, even though the chicken and shrimp were decent.

19,Pipat J.,"San Diego, CA",17,8,,2.0,2013-05-01,"I'm fairly new to the area so I came here for dinner with a couple of friends to become a little more familiar with the area. First thing I noticed was that it was pretty quiet inside. Not many customers. I took that as a bad sign.  When we got seated, we started off with the three for all appetizer, as I would normally do when I go to eat at a TGI Fridays. When it arrived, it did not look all too appealing. The loaded potato skins were hardly ""loaded"". They looked terrible. Like someone just threw all the stuff together and then microwaved it. Also the mozzarella sticks were mediocre. The cheese was okay but a little cold, so I think it was left on the plate for too long before it got served. Also, the marinara sauce that they gave to dip was old. You can tell because it wasn't the normal bright red, but instead it was a very dark and pasty color. The chicken wings were the only good part about it. Next up was the entrees. I got a steak, medium. Initially eating the steak was good because I started on the sides. As I got toward the slightly thicker parts of the steak, I began to notice it become redder and then eventually close to raw. This was pretty much 3/4 of my steak. My friend had ribs and shrimp. He said shrimp was good but the ribs were very dry. And by dry I mean dry. There was barely any hint of sauce on them. I felt like if we ended up complaining about the food, it would only come out with something extra in it.

Ick!  My husband ordered a burger and a margarita... he wasn't impressed.  The margarita tasted as if there wasn't a drop of alcohol in it.  This is probably why these are half off as well.  It's too bad.  We left hungry and out $30.  Remind me to not go to a chain restaurant again.  I'd rather have Applebee's any day.  If you haven't tried TFI Friday's or are thinking about trying it again, try something else you haven't had.  This place is icky.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-diego?start=100,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.056,2.12

72,Earl L.,"Escondido, CA",4,77,34.0,1.0,2013-08-01,"I loathe giving a negative review, especially for a single location of a large chain because the bar of expectations shouldn't be all that high to start for a formula restaurant. However, this last experience was so disappointing that I feel compelled to warn others. TGI Friday's is normally a solid choice for a decent meal at a value price and served with a cheerful disposition but, at least at this location, there seems to have been some recent tinkering with the successful model. First thing I noticed was that the restaurant was pretty empty for Friday at lunch rush. I soon learned why. The bathrooms had some sort of problem that was wafting a very unpleasant odor into the dining area. Nobody seemed to be tending to the problem, but our greeter was kind enough to proactively acknowledge the issue and offered to seat us in a different area of the restaurant. There were some folks back there dining, although I can only imagine how determined they were to avoid the indignity of non-booth seating that they were willing to put up with that stench. Found seating elsewhere fairly easily (remember that it was nearly empty) and placed orders. Had the salmon and langostino lobster - a very health conscious and tasty meal that I've enjoyed ever since TGIF added it to the menu. The meal itself was fine for me (my companion's was overcooked), but it took nearly 45 minutes to arrive. Completely unacceptable for a workday lunch for 2 people with few patrons in the restaurant. Also, noticed that the entree was decidedly smaller than I remember it being previously with only a few bits of langostino (I counted 8 little morsels). That, in itself, isn't that awful because the point of that dish is to offer taste with minimal calories. What wasn't cool about it though was that the price had gone substantially in the other direction - from $13.99 to $17.99. A tip for Friday's management - I think that $22 (pre-tip) is a bit outside your provence for a lite-sized meal and an iced tea. That pricing is more in line with a trendy bistro that customizes dishes daily. Based on the lack of a crowd, other former regulars might be in agreement with me on that one. The basics of TGI are still solid for what it is. I just hope that the people running the show take heed of the smaller crowds and get back to what they were doing reasonably well. Keep the restaurant tidy, serve up interesting and festive food, and price it in the mid-range. I think I'll wait until the place is busy again before considering a second chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-diego?start=60,2.16,2.41,2.41,2.244,2.3100000000000005
81,Nikki B.,"San Diego, CA",6,23,,3.0,2013-08-05,"A couple of us usually get together for their happy hour specials about once a week. I love the happy hour there. However, our last waitress was a complete ditz. I should've caught her name, but didn't. Anyway, it was a friday night after 10pm that we all decided to join for happy hour. Our waitress, dropped my friends appetizer on the ground, sourcream flying everywhere. Considering this was HER mistake, not ours, I felt like we shouldn't have been charged for that appetizer. May I remind you, that we had already been waiting for our food for over 25 minutes, so when this happened, we were a tad bit upset. Our waitress was very apologetic (not that I thought she was sincere) but nonetheless, she apologized. I still felt like it was bad customer service to not remove it off of our bill- but 1/2 off the appetizers for happy hour... WHATEVER. Four dollars is not a large sum of money. So, moving on.. The customer service is a hit or miss. Sometimes its really good, and other times it's whatever. But, considering this is the only Fridays near me, I will continue to go back, mainly for the happy hour specials.. I don't really go any other time. I mean, $5 margaritas and 1/2 off appetizers? I can't really pass that up. Beware of using the restroom at this location though. For as long as I can remember, which is about 8 months- they have had a REALLY bad sewage back up issue. Heading towards the restroom, in the hallways, you'll get a big wiff of this horrible smell.

30,Kevin F.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,,1.0,2013-08-05,"I took my family to Friday's tonight for dinner (haven't been there in a few years due to bad service and mediocre food) and had a terrible experience. So this is how it went...we got there and 6:15 and was sat immediately (only 4 other tables occupied when we arrived). The waitress came to our table at 6:26. We ordered my 3 year old son's meal and drink and said we'd order ours when she came back. She came back at 6:32 with my son's milk, then, my wife and I ordered our meals and drinks. Our waitress went MIA for a while and I had to get up to ask the host at the front of the store to get our waitress. A few minutes later she brought my wife's drink, but not mine. She said she'd be back with my beer. After another 8 minutes went by, I asked a passing waitress for the manager.  The manager came by a couple minutes later asking me what the problem was and I told her that we had been sitting at the table for over a half hour and my son still didn't have his food and that I was still without my beer. She promptly told me that I didn't get my beer because they were out of that specific beer. She didn't seem too concerned, nor comprehend why I was upset. I told her that we just wanted our check for my wife and son's drinks and we would go to the Chick Filet next store. While she was at our table, another waitress brought my son's food. He was hungry, so I decided to stick it out and ordered a different beer; the manager brought it to me a couple minutes later.  At 6:52, our dinners arrived and we proceeded to try salvaging our dinner experience. As for the food, my son's ""children's menu"" pizza looked like it came straight from a grocery store frozen section and it tasted just as bad, But he didn't know any better and was happy with it. My wife's cheeseburger was okay and my club sandwich was fine too. But after eating half my sandwich and fries, I found a long black hair in my fries. THAT WAS IT!!!! I called for the waitress and showed her the hair. I told her I'd like to speak with the manager again and she quickly took away my plate and walked away. A couple of minutes later, the manager came by and said he heard there was a problem. Again, she seemed like she didn't care and wanted to be anywhere else. I told her that I just wanted my check so we could go. She said she would comp the dinner. I told her that I wanted to give her some ""constructive criticism"" and she listened for a moment. I told her that she came across that she didn't care about the problems we had and that she should at least make an attempt to emphasize with a customer when they've had a bad experience. Again, she just went through the motions and did the absolute minimum to settle the issue.  This was the first time I had been at a TGI Fridays in a long time (due to poor past experiences) and I will not be back ever again. However, I don't put all the blame on the waitress or the manager. The TGI Friday corporate team is also to blame, since ongoing training and higher service standards that should be passed down from corporate would go a long way. All around...a very poorly run restaurant. We walked across the parking lot to Chick Filet and were greeted promptly with a warm smile and finished our dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-diego?start=40,2.16,2.4,2.4,2.212,2.3040000000000003

The sauce was lumpy, and fishy. The langastino was rubbery and the salmon was over cooked. I tried to drown my sorrows in a cocktail. I wanted one of their featured Makers Mark cocktails since I'm a huge Makers fan. I asked if I could have the cocktail ($12) without the souvenir glass.

When we arrived, it was SUPER packed and they told us it would be a wait and we could sit at the bar to avoid the wait...Fine. The bartender found out that I didn't have my ID so we were kicked out of the bar, after being there for 10 min already. We then waited another 10 minutes just to get a seat at a table. The waitress came, asked us if we were ready to order (we had just gotten our menus) and never came back when we told her we weren't ready. We had to have a passing waiter take our order, as well as the manager had to refill our drinks. After all that our waiter still hadn't come to see if we wanted to order food. We waited 45 minutes before we ever even saw her again. She didn't even acknowledge the fact that we hadn't had any service from her. After that point she did not come back again, instead she insisted on serving the other tables that had bigger groups of people (obviously she was focused on large tips). When we finally got our food the Parmesan breaded chicken with 4 noodles and a small caprese salad was a rip off. It tasted good, but wish I would have received the portion I have gotten on several other occasions. My husband said his food was alright, he got the buffalo chicken burger, but there was very little meat on the sandwich, and his fries were so salty he couldn't eat half of them. Again, very abnormal since we have eaten at this location before. After finishing our meal our waitress asked if we wanted water, keep in mind we hadn't had new water for at least 45 minutes, and she never refilled mine. Needless to say this is the worst experience I've had at TGI Fridays, and I will not be coming back to this location because of this.

I decided to try the Grilled Chicken Cobb lunch special, which included balsamic chicken breast on top of romaine with  grape tomatoes and hard-boiled egg. The salad is supposed to come with bacon and bleu cheese as well but I passed on both. The ranch dressing was decent but not my favorite.

Happy hour here has a good selection of wines, beers and drinks at a discount, and also some good food items. Join the Stripes club. Points add up fast and then there's free food (they're generous). All in all, this place is good, easy to find, has plenty of parking, and is consistent.

I told my husband what a great place this was.  Let's go and have a drink, watch the game, and have some dinner.   I ordered the grilled salmon with langostino lobster in alfredo sauce with steamed vegetables and rice.  The salmon was so overcooked it was hard around the edges, the langostino was soft and mushy; also very overcooked, the vegetables were steamed to death.  I think the only thing I liked was the jasmine rice, really no jasmine flavor, and my Ciroc Bellinitini martini. My husband ordered the half slab of ribs and sirloin steak.  He ordered his steak medium and surprise, surprise the steak was cooked exactly the way he liked it.  He totally enjoyed his meal and the two draft Buds. All in all, I will go back, but will be more cautious about what I'm ordering.  Fish, no.  Chicken, maybe.  Steak, for sure and the ribs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-diego?start=20,2.24,2.41,2.41,2.152,2.3420000000000005

Every 2 weeks I get an email with 2 coupons: $5 off $15 purchase or 20% off the food bill. I check my emails for specials like Pick 2 for $10, where you get an $8 appetizer & a $9 entree for $10. Happy hour hosts half-price full size appetizers, making it easy to rack up the rewards. I've been a rewards member for a few years so I've earned several free meals. They even have double point months! I always tip based on the price of the meal, not what I paid, so many times my tip was more than the receipt total. Everything on the menu is delicious, except the wedge salad, which is, well, a wedge of lettuce. I love salads but this was a wedge of lettuce. Not salad; Lettuce. Plain lettuce. Like Vons lettuce.

33,Cheryl A.,"San Diego, CA",5,63,76.0,2.0,2014-03-13,"I ate there tonight because Broken Yolk was closed. I ordered the Bleu Cheese Stacked Burger and my cousin, whose birthday we were celebrating, ordered the Philly Stacked Burger. We got the special with the bottomless fries for $10. The choices for the bottomless fries were seasoned (over salted with black pepper), parmesan (looked like wedges), and sweet potato. The restaurant was more than half empty so we thought we would get our food quickly. It took awhile for our burgers to arrive and we were disappointed visually and in taste. The burgers in the advertisement looked much bigger and you can see all the components. The burgers we received looked nothing like the photos in the menu. After going to awesome burger spots like Stacked, the burgers we got were so-so. The buns were generic, like they bought them across the street at a grocery store in the clearance section. The meat was ok. I'd rather spend the money on a great burger someplace else and spend the same amount of money. The bright side in the meal was the parmesan potato wedges. Those were pretty good.  Burgers: Meh. Go to a place like Stacked for much better quality and for a similar price. Waitress/Staff: Meh. They were ok. They did their best in smiling and being cordial. It's like they were there and not there. It must have been a long day for them. We did experience one super happy and friendly server. She gave us a helping of sweet potato fries. I liked her upbeat and positive energy. Location: Really good. That's why were there.  I find that most places usually give out a free birthday dessert for the celebrant. Maybe I've been spoiled by that and so I was hoping they would the same at TGIF's. Nope, but our waitress did light a candle. Dessert was also ok. I would rather have spent the same amount of money on a dessert someplace else like Cold Stone or Lappert's but alas, we were already there.

The mozza sticks were their trademark and now they ruined them! We'll probably never go back but only because the food was horrible which is not this restaurant in general's fault.

Then the proverbial icing on the cake.... the stale and small size were a shock.  The two deserts were not even 1/3 of a cup in volume.  The brownie was so stale I couldn't cut it with a knife.  The lemon cheese cake was closer to 1/4 cup in dimension. I called the manager to ask if they usually come so small and she said 'yes'!  What a shock.  I will not be returning to this TGI Fridays. I called our order in ahead of time and arrived at the time it was to be ready.  I had to wait another 20 minutes and it was cold.  What a pity.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-diego,2.64,2.45,2.45,,2.5260000000000002

Since we had food at the previous event, none of us were hungry, so we only got coffees, hot chocolate and soda, and my review is mostly for the comfort level and the service, which was very good, cordial and we felt comfortable there, so I will consider this place again when having to meet with a group of people late at night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-diego,2.48,2.42,2.42,,2.444

His back up bartender/server and came over to our table to clear our plates. (We weren't even all of the way done yet, she just grabbed them.) She spilled ranch all over my step dad, my mom and all over my purse. She then comes back, grabs more plates and says ""I won't spill on you this time!"" and laughed.
