16,Mark E.,"Santa Barbara, CA",1,5,,2.0,2012-06-19,"I don't expect great food at a TGIF, but I expect decent chain food and timely service. When we arrived, we headed over to a table in the bar next to the windows facing the lake. The view is AWESOME. Unfortunately that is the last good thing I have to say about our experience.  We quickly overheard the neighboring tables had failed to get their orders.  Meanwhile, the waiter was busy chatting up one of his female co-workers instead of getting us menus or helping either of the other tables staring directly at him trying to get his attention.  Eventually he went to a neighboring table and was told by the customer he still wanted the cocktail and hopefully the third time is a charm.  The waiter continued to ignore us, strolled back to the bar (presumably actually place our neighbors drink order), but stopped on his way to chat with a group of three other TGIF employees for a couple of minutes.  Customers have obviously been waiting a long time, are complaining that orders are wrong and missing loud enough for us to overhear and the TGIF employees are standing around laughing and chatting.  All in plain view of the customers they are failing to serve. We moved to the bar, away from the awesome view, hoping that the bartender would actually serve us.  Eventually we got the honor of placing our orders.  Of the four dishes we ordered, one was good, one was completely over cooked, dry and chewy, the third was cooked but totally cold, and the fourth was wrong.  It's been a few days so I don't remember what the issue was, but two out of four meals were sent back.  I decided to eat the shoe leather they served me because I was hungry and had no confidence in the second attempt happening in a timely manner, nor did I like the odds of the dish actually being any better. I debated giving the place one star, but gave it two for the proximity to the park, the view and because I will probably give the place one more try in the future.  But it was by far the worst run big chain restaurant I have ever been in and if my next visit is similar, I will drop it to one star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2?start=40,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056

We were staying at Castaway Bay and decided to have dinner at TGIs, simply out of convenience. Our waitress was great (Xavier), brought us refills without asking, came by multiple times, our drinks came out on time, as did our app, as did our meal. The manager even came by after to ask how things were, we joked with him about the whiney Yelp reviews and told him our service/food was great. I had the sirloin/ribs combo, everything was cooked perfect and tasted good. Our kids loved their food as well. Was it a couple bucks more than the one by our house? Yea, but it is a resort town and the outside bar overlooking the bay was awesome to say the least.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2?start=20,2.256,2.256,2.256,2.256,2.256
10,Christina T.,"Blairsville, GA",10,74,1.0,1.0,2012-07-07,"I'm writing this after my experience here yesterday and I used to work in the restaurant business.  We got there around noon or 1 wasn't exactly sure what time but it was mid day, walked in with 2 kids and us asked to be seated they said it would be a 5 min wait.... really?! The place was empty. How is going to be a 5 min wait? So we waited though A/C was nice.  We were seated I come over after handwashing with the kids  and he says he ordered us some drinks which is great and a waitress comes up and asks if we want drinks.... uh yes we already ordered them but can you add a couple waters please?  Apparently there was a mix up so they worked it out, the second person came over the girl, and took our food order.  So we go through about 3-4 cups of rootbeer between my kids and my friend who was with us. It was kept refilled bu there was ulterior motive behind it. 35 minutes later in a still fairly empty restaurant we're still waiting.   People after us were getting more food, and more complicated food than us before us.  We ordered, chicken fingers, and 2 sandwiches.  35 min wait, then to top it off, they brought out mine and the kids food, then his about 5 min later, didn't have his sweet potato fries either, and my fries were cold.  I asked to speak with a manager.  As I did one manager walked right by us after they had called for a manager and no one responded... ok douche.  Finally one came out, she was nice and comp'd the males meal, and halved our meals which I was happy with because my fries were cold, and the kids had to wait 35 min I don't know if you sat in a place with kids with that big of an age difference but you can only keep them both happy with similar activities for so long.  Anyways I would not suggest this place again they're overpriced for the shitty service they provide.  We went there for the first time in May and it was actually nice, this time was hell.

They didn't. Cedar Point chooses their menus. But between his and the bartenders efforts they managed to make me one. It was not exact, but very close. and VERY tasty! I definitely applaud their efforts.  The appetizers were quite god. Chips, salsa and spinach dip. I had the Salmon and my husband had the Steak and Ribs, both Jack Daniels style. Delicious!

I got the half-rack of ribs with French fries. I wanted it with the Jack Daniels sauce too and they were able to provide it on the side.  -Friendly service. Since Hotel Breakers just re-opened, I felt like they were trying extra hard to make it a good experience. CONS: -Prices are a bit higher than your neighborhood TGIF. -They do NOT take any coupons or provide Stripes chips (normally you get free tortilla chips for being a Stripes member). I will say that they DO give you your Stripes points for dining there, though, so that was at least good.  This is the only ""casual upscale"" dining actually IN the hotel (the other two were Perkins, which I'd compare to a Denny's, and Tomo, which is a bit pricier), also.

9,Mo J.,"Ann Arbor, MI",0,9,,1.0,2015-06-08,"It's what you expect, regular TGIF, yes it's more expensive than your average tgif, yes accept that as it is, you're paying premium for the convenience of mediocre food instead of the nasty grease overtly sugary stuff you only find in the park.  So it's worth the cost I guess.  Service was horrible though.  Really really really slow service, but I don't blame the bartender, I actually felt bad for them,  (we sat at the bar), I guess it's management's fault for understaffing.  The bartenders seemed way overwhelmed.  I ordered water through our bartender Corey, when I ordered my beer.  The bartender forgot our drinks as the guests who arrive 20 min after we did already got their drinks before we did.  He even said, ""oh sorry, forgot your drinks I'll get that for you"", but got the drinks for the couple next to us first before he finally made our drinks, which by the way the couple next to us ordered drinks way after we did.  We got our food and ate half our meal before we got our drinks, I'd say it was 30 minutes till we got our drinks, and that is not an over exaggeration.  The bartender did forget my water though as I was getting dehydrated.   He checked on us and I asked for water.   Minutes later, I still didn't get my water.   By then we were done with the meal and the other bartender (older english gentleman) checked in on us, and I asked for water and the bill.  The bill came first, water didn't come yet.  I paid the bill with cash and left 30% hoping the high tip would catch the bartender's attention and finally remember my water, but I guess it didn't catch their attention much, because the older gentleman collected the bill, and the water came a lot later than I would have like, (about 10 minutes after we paid our bill).  I understand that it was busy, but asking for water that many times, and treating you nice on the bill, only having to have my water much much later than we paid our bill, leaves me really disgruntled.  It's server 101, to provide guests with water when asked as hydration is an importance to guest experience.  Food came out fast, and it was at the quality that I expected.  Faster than our drinks apparently.   And way faster than my water.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2?start=40,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.2760000000000002,2.16

Now lets jump hours later on this same day. While this still wasn't my first choice for dinner this was my only choice since we had stayed in the park until closing time and everything had closed.

Its a simple burger with jack daniels bbq sauce on top. You would think this would be easy to make but nope somehow they couldnt get this together. Burger was luke warm at best.

Some highlights: 1.  They still have crap on the walls!  Seems like most Friday have updated to get rid of their signature tchotchkes. 2.  Servers here are super friendly.  They seem to really understand their clientele. 3.  Late night food.  It was great to come here after the park closed (at 10) and still be able to get food.  We were hungry. 4.  Cocktails.  They've got some really good ones for being another link in the chain. ...and my only real lowlight is that they are definitely overpriced.  They are clearly taking advantage of location and circumstance, knowing that guests exiting the park have very limited options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36

We had a dirty table and the manager cleaned it up himself and asked if we wanted to move first.  Next, they fixed the issue I had with my entree.  The service was super cool. It was a busy day but we had were seated as soon as we walked in.  I will return and hope for great service again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
33,Maria V.,"Lorain, OH",38,3,,1.0,2016-06-21,Unless you are already at Cedar Point FORGET ABOUT IT!  I love Friday's and so does everyone in our group.  Since they moved onto Cedar Point property it will cost your $15 to drive to the restaurant!  You heard it right... $15 before you get to their door.   Unacceptable regardless of our financial circumstances.  Friday's does not have an agreement with the amusement park to reimburse this charge and we chose to eat elsewhere on the lake.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

53,Ariel C.,"Plano, TX",89,2,,1.0,2016-07-01,"Horrible, awful service . We stayed at Hotel Breakers and had no choice for dinner  after 10pm but Friday's. We walked in to employees who clearly did not want to be there, when I asked if we could switch to booth the hostess paused and continued to put menus down on table and said to hold on and walked away without ever returning. Waitress was nice but slow. Ordered a $22 appetizer that was burnt pretzels and dipping cheese hardened, way over cooked chicken, and dried out potato skins. We then ordered our dinner and waited over 50 minutes without a word of why it was taking so long while managers walked past us until the waitress said it should be coming out about 2 minutes before. I watched multiple managers walk by the entire time as tables who came in 30 minutes after us got their food, one dressed in blue and one in black, without acknowledging our table or saying anything whatsoever about the wait or how our meal was. On top of it all, the bill with tip was $200 for an appetizer and meals for 4. I will never step in there again, to whoever owns or manages this place you seriously need to step up and do your job because it's a joke.

45,Jerrell P.,"Gwynn Oak, MD",0,3,,1.0,2016-09-03,"Labor Day weekend a group of friends and myself visited the in Cedar Point and wanted to grab a bite to eat after hours at the TGI Fridays on site under the impression it would be very similar to other Friday locations we have visited recently. First our waiter greeted us by stating ""Nationally advertised specials are not available here i.e. Endless Apps, Happy Hour all day, and no coupons. Next it's listed on Yelp and on the Fridays website location hours open until 2 am. WRONG! They close at 12 midnight which threw our plans of a nap after a full day at the park off. Service is beyond slow and the staffs attitude sucks. Bartenders eating while working in front of customers, and the prices are extremely higher than other locations. We will NOT revisit this location during the remainder of the stay here at Cedar Park. Too bad for them..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2?start=20,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

22,Jeremy N.,"Southfield, MI",422,335,20.0,3.0,2017-02-01,"I have been to this Fridays numerous times over the years and the experience varies because the time of year also determines the service as well as the time of day. In the summer, this place is a madhouse service wise and you are waiting quite some time day or night. In the fall months, the restaurant is pretty busy during the day but at night it simmers down and you can really enjoy yourself. The prices are a bit escalated but that is expected. The last time I dined here, the bar tender was pretty rude and pushy because it was the last half hour or hour that they were open, which shouldn't matter because you are open until the last applicable serving time period.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
44,Bill E.,"Brentwood, PA",85,13,,1.0,2017-02-02,By far the worst experience that I have ever had at a restaurant slow doesn't even begin to describe it they were less then eight tables in the restaurant 30 minutes to get potstickers and sliders started off host had no personality seem like an inconvenience when we asked to sit at a different table so we could look out the window and not look at a wall then five minutes for the waiter to appear another 15 and the manager finally came over to take food order and 20 minutes to get the food I guess we were lucky then the other table where it took 20 minutes and I had to point out that they were waiting for a waiter to come by when know when no One had come to that table the manager seemed completely put out and bothered by the whole situation being a platinum member for Cedar point I would rather pay the price in the park for food then to set in a cool restaurant for a little bit away from the crowd thanks for ruining Fridays as a whole two different states bad experiences in bothI wish I could give them a negative start because I would -5 at least. Being so long since gave review and no response from this Friday's or corporate I can safely save this chain cares in no way how guests are treated and there for will never step foot in another Friday's no matter where I am,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2?start=20,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

We laughed as we were to hungry and hot to care. Arrived, seated my family of six. No wait. Waitress arrived, food quick and correct.
