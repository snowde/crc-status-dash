The 2nd time with my brother, as well blah. I again returned due to it being close to home and not wanting to commute further on 287, and it was ridiculous.

43,Melissa S.,"Yonkers, NY",46,93,19.0,3.0,2012-08-12,"I'm sorry but automatically any large food chain establishment gets three stars from me.  In all my years, I haven't find one that had me at ""OMG this was fabulous service and food"" but just more of, ""it filled me up and I can sleep peacefully now"".  I went to eat at Fridays with some co-workers and was able to split the Jack Daniels sampler (Crispy Cajun shrimp, Asian-inspired Sesame Jack Chicken Strips and Jack Daniel's® glazed baby back pork ribs).  I do have to admit that their Jack Daniel's selection is pretty good.   I even ordered their Jack Daniel's salmon with a side of mashed because I felt I had enough meat.  It was happy with it considering it a food chain, and on the well done side but I wouldn't expect Friday's to know how to cook salmon correctly anyway. It's tough in general.   The waitress was good.  Very attentive and concerned for my well being and asked if I was driving when I asked for a stronger drink as a second.  Obviously, she doesn't know who I am so I told her I was a veteran.  I doubt Friday's drink could even give me a slight buzz, which it didn't. Ohhh, lightweights.   Anyway, go for the Jack Daniel's selection.

You hear the workers cursing and shouting ""fuck this, shit that, nigga nigga nigga,blap blap blap!"", ya know, the typical way blacks and hispanics talk: absolutely vulgar! The waitress didn't seem like she cared about anything. I have long hair so she mistook me for a chick and she never ever apologized. Typical. Blacks and hispanics don't apologize for anything. So fucking rude and unprofessional that whole place is. Of course you always get the classic ghetto staring contest as well. You know what I mean ""What choo lookin' at, you long haired cracka?!"" Like my friends father who's Puerto Rican said ""Where there's caucasian, there's quality."" So true. Maybe other people don't mind this treatment, but I'm from the Bronx, and I had to put up with this shit my whole life, so after a while, it gets kinda old. Also, I'm half Rican myself, just to let anybody who reads this know. Anyways, I will recommend this place to no one except for other ghetto people. It wouldn't surprise me if they spit in our food. I hope this place gets hit by a meteor, with all the workers in it, leaving nothing but a giant crater! Ghetto people ruin everything! They should call this place WOODLANDS THE RESTAURANT!

50,Beauty W.,"Bronx, NY",35,50,49.0,3.0,2015-02-11,"I went here on a Saturday, 2/7/2015, and it was an okay experience. There was a 5-10 minute waiting period before we were seated by the hostess. Our server, Jeff, was very attentive to us before and during our meal. We chose the Friday's Pick Three-For-All as our appetizer. We had a choice between boneless or traditional wings. Of course we picked the boneless option. Who wants to make things hard when they can be so easy? Crispy green bean fries and mozzarella sticks were our choices as well. Celery sticks also came in the appetizer, 6 to be exact. Everything was delicious but I didn't care too much for the dipping sauces. I usually order my favorite entree, Cajun shrimp & chicken pasta, but I decided to try something different. After seeing a photo of the sizzling chicken & shrimp entree, I couldn't contain the curiosity of my taste buds. My guy also raved about how delicious it is, as did Jeff. I was sold from the moment my guy told me to try it because I know he likes the best. To have more than 1 person telling me about the dish, as I just said...SOLD!!! Let's just say that although it wasn't disgusting or nasty, I won't be ordering it again. I love shrimp just as much as any other individual who's fortunate to not be allergic to it, but it's seasoned better in the dish I usually order. The chicken was mucho perfecto and the melted cheese under the onions, peppers, and creamy mashed potatoes didn't taste bad. It's just not as good as my usual. Don't take my word for it. Try it out anyway. Different people like different things. I just chose to drink the free water as my beverage choice. I did indulge in a dessert for my sweet tooth, couldn't resist.

26,Caitlin N.,"White Plains, NY",66,84,6.0,2.0,2015-07-30,"This review is based on two separate visits. I first came here with my inlaws, and it was decent. It was a Saturday evening and we had no problem getting a table. Our waitress was nice and attentive throughout the majority of dinner. Unfortunately, the food wasn't so great. We ordered an appetizer sampler, which the mozz sticks and wings were okay, but the potato skins were dry and disgusting. The two steak dishes that were ordered tasted okay, but were not cooked to order (requested Rare and received Medium Well). I personally had the Smoke Stack burger which was pretty good, and my MIL seemed to like her pasta dish. However, the next day my grandmother-in-law had food poisoning and was in and out of the bathroom for the next 4 days. Since I had ordered one of the JumpBurger specials, my husband and I decided to come back for the free burger. We did the $10 appetizer (the boneless wings) and each ordered a burger. The wings - First batch was Parm Garlic - it was delicious! I would not hesitate to have anyone order those. Second batch took about 30 minutes to get after we requested - Sriracha Buffalo. It was spicy and pretty good as well. We decided to risk it and order a 3rd batch - again it took over 30 minutes to get. We tried the Memphis BBQ, which is nothing special. We took them home since we were waiting forever and got full. The burgers - the hubby ordered the Sicilian Burger, which had a lot of flavor and he really enjoyed. I had the Chorizo Burger, which wasn't as impressive flavor wise. Unfortunately, I also came down with a batch of food poisoning and was in the bathroom all night.  Our server was also very nice, but always disappeared. When we needed him we could never find him (for drink refills, or to put in our wing order, and none of our dirty plates were cleared until we asked for the check) Not sure what's going on at this location - I have frequented other Friday's and never had sub-par food or food poisoning.

The service was horrible, our waiter definitely seemed more focused on her cell phone then her job, had an attitude, wrote our whole order down wrong and then when we complained to the manager that everything came out wrong and mind you she forgot to put our appetizer in, she told the manager right in front of us that it was our fault, we were liars and told her exactly what she wrote And that we must just be trying to get her fired?!? Such a joke of a night! What would we get out of by lying about what we ordered? The whole experience was very frustrating due to her errors but apparently it was our fault and the manager didn't even do anything to compensate! I swore I would never go back!!  Until a few weeks ago, while out with my mother and baby, we decided to stop here on an early friday afternoon. The place was very empty maybe a handful of tables so I said whats the worst that can happen?! HAHA I JINXED IT THERE! We get seated, a waitress comes over and immediately asks what do we want to order! No introduction, not asking for drinks she wanted our entree! A little pushy! But ok, so I said to the woman I have a coupon, will I be able to use? She says ""I have to see the coupon"", as I look down on my phone to pull the coupon up and still speaking to her the whole time, I look up and realized she was gone! HOW RUDE?! How do you just walk away while your customer is talking to you?! Then to see she was at another table of 4 people, laughing and telling jokes that annoyed me! So I sat patiently and waited for her return, waited, waited and waited... Finally 10 minutes of not returning I decided to leave! THIS WOMAN NEVER CAME BACK! She finally walks right past us as we were about to walk out the door and never said a word cause she was rushing back to that other table!

76,Lauren D.,"Bronxville, NY",24,99,240.0,1.0,2017-05-25,"As a rule, I generally avoid chain restaurants. My last experience at Friday's reminded me why. It was a Saturday night and we were a large group of 7. We were in the area and had not made any reservations. Friday's had no trouble giving us a table without a wait.  Call me cynical, but in retrospect perhaps that should have been my first warning.  We were seated at a table without any utensils or place settings. We all ordered, some of us opting for 1 or 2 appetizers as our main course instead of an entree. After a short wait, a server brought the ""appetizer"" selections only. Service 101 would be to serve everyone at the same time, since we had ordered the appetizers as our main course, but I let it slide since they were from the appetizer menu. Maybe they thought we were planning to share. I'd typically wait for everyone to be served before I start eating, but, not wanting the food to get cold, those of us who had ordered appetizers began to eat. Halfway through, we began searching for napkins, because they had still never brought us any. We reached over and took utensils from the table next to us. My friend ordered an iced tea and was brought a coke. 2 of us ordered water. The waitress brought me my glass and then set another one down on the table saying, ""I brought an extra glass of water in case anyone wants."" ""I guess she forgot I ordered water too,"" my friend murmured once she'd walked away.  As the ""appetizer course"" finished, a server came back and dropped off 2 sandwiches and an order of fries that had been forgotten in the appetizer round. We were still waiting for 2 meals. By the time the 2 that got their meals were almost finished with their sandwiches, the other 2 still had not made an appearance. We flagged down our waitress and pointed it out to her. After scanning the table to verify that no, we had not hidden 2 burgers somewhere, she went off in search of the missing meals. We confirmed that we were missing a regular burger and a black bean burger. A server came by a few minutes later offering a chicken sandwich. We were missing 2 burgers so we shook our heads and he went off to ask every other table if they had ordered a chicken sandwich. After making the rounds, he came back to us. ""Are you sure you didn't order a chicken sandwich?""  We had, but that meal had arrived during course #2. We were missing 2 burgers. Our waitress came back for another consult. A few more minutes passed and finally, one of the burgers came out. Everyone else had finished their meals by this point. My friend began eating her burger. The black bean burger was still no where in site.  Really, the place was not that crowded and it wasn't even a meat burger. Were they growing the vegetables back there?  We asked again. Once the last burger was almost finished we found the manager.  At one point, our waitress started towards us, saw him still sitting there without a meal and turned and walked away without coming to the table. My friend with the burger had finished already when the manager came to the table with the black bean burger. Her apology, ""Don't shoot the messenger. I have your burger.  Sorry for the wait.""  We hadn't even said anything as she approached, but really, that's your apology?  We had been in the restaurant for over 2 hours at this point and this guy had sat there patiently, without complaining, watching everyone else eat in 3 separate rounds.  In their defense, they did end up comping the 2 burgers. I still will never be back and would recommend you avoid unless you are not very hungry, hate good service, and have a few hours to kill waiting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scarsdale,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

We were seated in a booth (no problem), with sticky floors (yuck) and told a someone (names aren't important) would be over to take your order. Since this booth was near the kitchen, we could hear most of the staff while we waited. Waited for water that never came and neither did anyone to take our order in a nearly empty restaurant. The greeter that seated us was still in the kitchen with everyone else, so after 23 minutes of being ignored, we left. I was hangry and refused to wait another moment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scarsdale,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
69,Jake M.,"Yonkers, NY",0,2,,5.0,2017-10-02,I loved it. I came here for the unlimited appetizers and their selection was great and definitely good deal. I recommend the wings and the mozzarella sticks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scarsdale,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
77,Daniel B.,"Port Chester, NY",2,22,3.0,1.0,2017-10-07,"Short version: Only come here if you want to feel like it's a Monday. Went there for endless appetizers, received endless wait time AFTER being seated at our table. We weren't assigned a waiter, but that's okay, because we BECAME the waiters.  Long version: Came here on a Friday evening because 2 members of our group like Fridays, and it wasn't busy inside at all. We we promptly seated, followed by receiving no attention at all. After a lengthy and unacceptable period of time, we left. And we DID wait long, because I was looking forward to the ""Really Good Cheeseburger"". They didn't even ask what was wrong when they saw us walk out. Felt pretty disrespected.  We proceeded next door to Pizza & Brew, where it was more crowded but we were promptly served. So problem solved, don't go to this Friday's if you want service.  Sorry, can't give a good review if we receive no service at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scarsdale,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16

74,Cathy G.,"Hastings-on-Hudson, NY",33,28,3.0,1.0,2017-11-03,"Horrible horrible, my son had Mac & cheese said it was ok , husband liked his ribs but nothing to rave about, I had the 15$ unlimited apps. Well the waiter forgot to tell me it's 1 dish at a time my family was done eating and I had 2 appetizers, I was starving, when I confronted the waiter he said that's the repercussion , I ordered a burger the after waiting another 10 minutes I cancelled and go the check, 0 money for a tip nasty waiter and so unprofessional",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scarsdale,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16

70,Nelson A.,"Northeast Yonkers, Yonkers, NY",61,1,,1.0,2018-01-10,"I'm very dissatisfied with the level of customer service that I received at this location tonight. I regularly visited this location 4 to 5 times a week and sometimes even twice in one day. I can honestly say that I enjoyed myself and had a friendly rapport with the bartenders, they always have a great and upbeat attitude. John, Omarion,Ralph and Johnathon have always gone above and beyond on ensuring that myself ( and whatever guest I brought ) had a great time. Its upsetting that it was the managers on duty that dropped the ball. I ordered an app ( boneless wings) and a burger. Like I stated earlier I'm not fussy at all. The burger came out first and BURNED.. I understand that maybe that burger doesn't take long to cook, but for it to come out charred and hard that's unacceptable. I pointed it out to the bartender on duty and he agreed and took it back to tell the kitchen to remake another one. At that time my APPETIZER came out, that's when I decided not to take the new burger because it's not the first time that I have had an issue with my food, whether it came out STALE, UNDERCOOKED and or OVERCOOKED not Per my request. You would imagine that the managers would take time out of their ""BUSY"" shift to come over and apologize for the quality of the food . A small apology would've diffused the situation,but The managers decided to sit down in a booth behind me just to chat, I guess cause they were exhausted from cooking ( I noticed one of them cooking ). I'm not looking for anything I just want people to be aware of how they treat unsatisfied guest. This isn't the first time I have had an issue with the food and managers. So I left hungry and upset. I'll guess I'll take my small 150 dollars that I spend there a week elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scarsdale,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
