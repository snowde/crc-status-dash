We ordered two salads, I had the Yucatan Chicken Salad, which is great, and she got the Pecan Crusted Chicken Salad, which was equally delicious.  We would have loved to enjoy our lunch, and our conversation, but it was almost impossible as this guy WOULD NOT leave us alone to eat!  He kept walking by our table, butting in to our conversation and was just overall ruining our afternoon.  We could not get out of there quick enough, we asked for the check, paid and split!  I will probably not go back on a Saturday afternoon again, just in fear of having to deal with this bartender!!

I hate to admit it, but the Pretzels were REALLY good: warm, mushy, and lightly salted.  The Beer-Cheese didn't have any beer taste..it just tasted like a light cheese to me, but it was alright.  The Flatbread was OK - pretty light.  I'm glad it didn't have much cheese.

I was snooping through their drink menu and it smelled like barf with stains on it.  Ordered my steak medium rare and it came back medium-well. Asked for the manager and they offered to replace it with a new one (I don't believe in wasting food so I refused). Not only was the steak bad, but the mashed potatoes were very bland. Tasted even worse than something could come out of the box. Mac and Cheese had a burnt buttered noodle. Hardly any cheese and they use penne rigate as their pasta. After we called the manager to the table to let her know about the food, the waitress became very hostile and upset at us as she would make as little contact as she could with us. There is a sign on the door that advertises free WiFi. As I tried to login to it, their website failed to work. I asked the waitress why it might not be working and she simply just shrugged her shoulders.

The waitress must have forgotten our appetizer because we got the soup and burger first. We mentioned it to another waitress who was fast to resolve the issue. The manager came to our table to apologize and got a bunch of apologies all around. Honestly, it wasn't even a big deal for us. They didn't even charge us for our appetizers which was nice of them but again we didn't mind the slip up, it happens. What I didn't care for was the food and my drink. My drink was too cloyingly sweet with hardly any vodka in it. The French onion soup was super salty. The potato skins were dry and kind of burnt from sitting in hot oil and my husbands burger must have originated from a frozen patty because it was leaking water.

Each time they do it, it gets worse and worse.  The service was so slow even with an almost empty restaurant. After we ordered the app, it took forever and every new time we got our apps, it got saltier and saltier. They are skimpy on the meat too. Basically they want you to get full on the carbs (bread, tostada, wonton skins, etc). The potstickers had very little filling. The ""new"" tostadas were mostly some weird salty, sweet white sauce and wilted cilantro. There was barely any braised bbq beef. Like a tiny piece on each. My flatbread barely had chicken on it... mostly bread. The last time I ordered the flatbread, there was NO chicken. I mean, they barely put chicken as it is.... but still! This used to be one of the best endless apps, but they ruined it! I brought it to attention from my server but he just apologized. He didn't offer to fix it or anything. All he did was ask if we wanted to order dessert... Nice. I'm pretty sure the manager brought us our flatbread and I'm sure he could see there was no chicken but he still brought it. Idk what that says about the service there. You can tell the servers don't want you to order more. They act like it! They weren't like that before.. idk what happened. So disappointing because their endless apps used to be good! It's only $12/person but I still feel like I was ripped off. It used to be $10/person and they raised the price.

She got the steak sizzler w spinach and mashed potatoes . I ordered the turkey burger w broccoli instead of fries and we shared a pick three app.  At first the service was a but slow but we were chatting and in no hurry so we didnt mind. The app was great. Their pretzels and cheese, boneless wings and pot stickers are always very good. Their potato skins are very crispy and over fried , lots of oil coming from them. Our meals came and i cut into my turkey burger and took a bite, it was so dry yet juicy in the middle. It wasnt too hot either so it might have been sitting waiting for my friends steak to be done. I told our waitress and she took it back and got me a new one, i asked for cheese this time hoping it would help. The new one was great and not dry at all. She came and checked back to make sure all was ok and it was. My friend gave her info for the free meal and when she cane back she let us know that she took my turkey burger off the bill bc i had to wait for the new one .

But it's unacceptable to me that he didn't listen to that simple request. I didn't ask for my mediocre cheeseburger to be served in a golden platter, I just wanted it cooked medium well.

He enjoyed the hamburger , what else would a kid order in a restaurant.  The food was good and the conversation enjoyable.  But I must comment on our server , the reason for this review.   This is not my first time dining at a Friday's.  This is my first time at this particular Friday's however.  Our server was Melissa.  She was very pleasant , always smiling , very polite and knew how to talk to customers.   I wish all wait staff were as polite as Melissa.  Why do I say that ?  Because there was a minor issue which she immediately addressed and resolved in a very professional manor.  She made us feel right at home. Kudos to Friday's for having such a polite , efficient employee on their staff.   **Free parking in the private lot, always a plus in my book.   The combination of good food , reasonable prices and polite wait staff give this place 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-schaumburg,2.36,2.36,2.36,2.16,2.36

The au jus is what makes it a french dip! Unfortunately, the person who brought us our food gave it to us and left right away. This meant I had to flag down our waitress to tell her it was missing the au jus. The chef must have forgotten about to get prepare it, because it took awhile for the waitress to return. She quickly left after she gave it to me so we had to flag her down again because my husband wanted a refill on his pop. She never asked how things were and she never asked if we needed anything.  After the meal, I went to the washroom. The lock on the stall I went into would not lock. I could tell the person in the stall next too me had the same problem. The sink splashed water everywhere and I could not get the paper towel dispenser to work.

I laid out all three trays on the lobby bench and to my surprise; one of the three orders was fully correct.  Roger the Mgr was quite helpful and got me the two lost and missing sides in a timely manner.  One other minor complaint, is that Maria the hostess was more focus on training a new hostess than helping a customer pick-up his online order.   Unsure if I should buy the (1.) ribs a la Carte to avoid any mistakes, (2.) give another chance so eventually the order will be correct or (3.) order on any other day but Friday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-schaumburg,2.36,2.57,2.57,,2.4859999999999998
