10,Martyn M.,"London, United Kingdom",356,380,250.0,3.0,2013-08-10,"The other night was the first time I ever went to TGI's, because I'd never really fancied it and this specific one is always absolutely mobbed. With promise of large tasty cocktails though, I managed to head along.  It's absolutely huge inside, with two floors of seating and a giant bar you can chill at, and the cocktails are glorious, but I can't really find much else good to say about it. The staff, on the most part, are incompetent and incredibly slow, apart from one waitress we had who was great. The food was meh, and the atmosphere is a bit chaotic when it's full.  If I was going back here it would definitely be for the cocktails. The large ones come in huge fishbowl glasses and are only about £8. Decent value for money!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland,,,,,

18,James N.,"Houston, United Kingdom",12,54,,4.0,2013-08-27,"So my friend had £180.00 worth of vouchers for TGI and being the generously, selfless soul that he is he decided to let his friends abuse his hospitality.  Que extravagant cocktail order: ""Yes I would like to make all 10 of those cocktails ultimate"" or buying enough food to feed a small country. I don't love TGIs and this review is definitely biased owing to the fact that I paid £10.00 for two courses lots of drinks and that still left a generous tip.  Lets be fair it's not TGI's fault that my friend has more money than sense.  It was a busy Friday night so we were split between two medium sized table that were beside each other.  Not ideal but we were a walk in on a Friday night so I can't really fault them for that.   Four of us shared the times square plater.  Despite the fact that this said serves 2-3 people it more than filled a hole and gave us a delicious variety of things filled with cheese, not so great if you're on a diet, and a heap load of chicken wings and other things.  Everything on this giant plate was delicious and they didn't scrimp on the portions, if you fancy a good greasy eat this is for you. So what do guys order when there being treated to pretty much free food?  Monster burgers apparently: ""A 12oz* burger heaped with crispy bacon, sliced Colby cheese, Cajun-battered onion rings and Friday's® mayo on a toasted seeded bun, with fresh cos lettuce, red onion and beef tomato. Served with extra Friday's® mayo""  Please don't sue me for copyright Mr TGI's lawyer. Sounds good, tasted great again the only fault I can make of this monstrosity was that either it or the starter was too big as I couldn't finish the beast, which was literally the size of my face.  As I said before not the biggest fan of TGI's but in general terms I think their chips could be up there with the best around, the saltiness, the crispyness and the little bit of skin left on makes them a real force to be reckoned with. Had several ultimate cocktails which certainly did the job as I stumbled out the place when we were done, they were delicious, not sure what they were but they were all different and all nice. All in all a great evening, we even tricked them into thinking it was one of our birthdays which lead to one slice of free cake and a long protracted happy birthday, followed by three cheers, followed by for he's a jolly good fellow, followed by some more cheering. The atmosphere in TGI's is great as dinners eat, drink and be merry.  While I think the food is overpriced, it is delicious and I think it is nice to come here every once in a while just to be reminded how a good chain works.  Those opposed to restaurant chains need not apply.   I definitely think the TGI's in Glasgow is the best in Scotland, but I can't claim to say that I've been in all the TGI's in Scotland.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland,,,,,
16,Stefanie L.,"London, United Kingdom",6,18,5.0,2.0,2013-09-09,"I'm not so sure about this place... The floor was sticky. Like, my feet stuck to the floor. The table was sticky as well; very unpleasant. I had one of the cooler summer drinks, which tasted pretty much only like ice infused with a sad bit of fruit syrup. The whiskey (I think?) sauce that came with the chicken wings was amazing; the wings didn't blow me away. The dessert - toffee popcorn brownie sundae - was spectacular. Overall, everything seemed a bit overpriced. The service was ridiculously bad - we had to wait ages for some drinks; and we were trying to catch the staff's attention for about 15 minutes straight while three of them were standing at the bar having a nice chat with each other... Overall, you pay more for the brand than anything else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland,,,,,
17,Leia M.,United Kingdom,0,14,,4.0,2013-10-27,"TGI Fridays is right on the corner of Buchanan Street. As you are walking up the street you can see the big red and white sign that says 'TGI Fridays'. It is easy to spot. As you walk in the first thing you see is the glass doors leading in to the restaurant. The walls are decorated with pictures. The place is quite dark and there isn't much lighting apart from the windows. I ordered the 'Classic American' burger with chips and an Oreo Milkshake. My food and drink both arrived quickly (Within 10-15 minutes). It was delicious. My burger was topped with tomato, lettuce, onion, cheese and Fridays trademark mayo. This was all served on a toasted crispy sesame seed bun. The burger was juicy, the lettuce was crisp, the tomato was fresh and the mayo was sensational. I definitely recommend it. The fries were really nice too. They were thin, crispy and nicely seasoned with salt and pepper. The Oreo Milkshake is definitely the best I've ever had. It was thick and extremely creamy. Overall, the meal was fantastic and very filling too.  The service was good and very cheery. The staff were all friendly. The toilets were very clean. The price though, is a little too much. Another negative point is that if you aren't ordering burgers, steaks or ribs (Grilled foods) then the food quality isn't as good. Overall, TGI Fridays is clean, offers great food, great service and I would give it 4/5. As the Fridays motto says 'In here, It's always Friday!'",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland,,,,,
6,Donald M.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",161,976,2534.0,3.0,2014-01-14,"I've been to TGI Fridays in the states on many occasions when l lived there and when you compare what we have in the UK to the states they are at opposite ends. I find the food not quite right but l suppose if you have not been to an original TGI Fridays you would not know any better. I took my partner with me on a week day for a late lunch, there was not a server designated to our table as we had three servers coming back and forth to our table, I think there was a shift change of staff. I find the food basic and over rated, not quite worth what you pay for. Food 2 Atmosphere 3 Service 3 Value 3",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland,,,,,
24,Kevin D.,"Chicago, IL",7,103,126.0,3.0,2014-05-06,"The food here was pretty good, large selection and decent sized portions. The service was extremely slow though, seems like they are pretty understated. It is also pretty pricy for what it is, with most burgers costing about £12-£13.

15,Laura P.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",191,120,427.0,4.0,2014-06-06,"I know chain restaurants like this are not for everyone but personally I've always quite enjoyed TGIs over the years.  The restaurant is bright and airy and on this visit we managed to wangle a booth style seat looking out to Buchanan Street. The servers are all super smiley American style and our waitress, Jill actually was American, so that added to the experience! Sometimes I've found the music a bit loud in here but on this occasion it was nice having some cheery tunes in the background.  The menu is focused around a variety of burgers, sandwiches, fajita dishes, ribs and other American classics. The burgers are now all served in brioche style buns and come with a choice of fries/ sweet potato fries or salad.  I opted for the veggie sandwich with salad and balsamic dressing hold the cheese! For some reason they call it a sandwich but it was just a veggie burger really, all be it a pretty tasty one with beans and spices. The brioche bun was sweet and tasty and the salad was pretty big with a pot of dressing on the side.  I noticed that my dressing didn't look like balsamic but was too busy with the ketchup to bother, but our lovely server Jill noticed on the way past and quickly swapped it for balsamic.  My dining companion opted for a chicken sandwich (burger :)) with fries and really enjoyed it, although she did say the fries were nothing special.  Now you can't go to TGIs without getting a dessert and the classic one I love which has remained unchanged for years is the chocolate fudge cake. Two spoons, don't bother with the icecream please and we were in sweet chocolate heaven. This isn't just any chocolate cake. This is TGIs chocolate fudge fixation cake - three layers of chocolate cake sandwiched with chocolate sauce and chocolate runny fudgy yumminess with more chocolate ganache sauce yumminess round the sides. I'll stop now - anyway it was good! The service was fast although it was only a mid- week night. I would say I always fine that TGIs is slightly overpriced- roughly £10 for a burger and accompaniment and about £6 for dessert (but desserts easily would do two people). Cocktails aren't really my thing but I know a lot of people who love them and from a quick look at the menu there's some unusual and tasty sounding ones to choose from.  Overall a tasty meal and great service and somewhere I'll definitely continue to visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland,,,,,
22,Duncan W.,"Kelvinbridge, Glasgow, United Kingdom",165,304,147.0,3.0,2014-07-09,"I begrudge using tgi's however it is one of the few established restaurant chains in the city centre that can actually deal with groups and has a wide enough menu to deal with most of my fussy eating friends. The food is only ever ok never excellent and the service can be slow. We waited 20 odd minutes to receive beers to the table on the last visit.  They have a large cocktail menu that seems quite overpriced. With the 2 sizes not exactly giving much value for money.  The service can be very hit and miss it depends who serves you. One visit the girl was lovely efficient and had a great attitude. The next visit the guy we had was terrible very disorganised slow and not particularly good at getting the right things to the right people.  It really isn't worth the prices but if you have groups of 6 or more it is very hard to find a place that will take you, although even these guys don't take reservations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland?start=20,,,,,
12,Matt F.,"Manchester, CT",4,13,1.0,3.0,2014-10-24,"All right, time for the American to write another review of an American establishment in Glasgow.  This is one of the few American sit-in chains in the UK, let alone Glasgow.  It's MOSTLY similar. TGIF's prides itself on starters.  You can find them in any stateside supermarket's frozen aisle.  They're great here as well.  My favourite would be the soft pretzels and cheese dip.  The cheese has a sharpness to it that puts it a cut above your typical nacho cheese, and the pretzels are salty and greasy enough to satisfy your cravings.  The buffalo wings are on point, too.  Still not REAL buffalo wings, but the sauce is proper. The menu is unsurprisingly small compared to its counterpart across the pond.  You'll find a good selection, but I honestly haven't been thrilled with anything other than burgers/sandwiches and the ribs.  And even those aren't quite as good as the ones I've had in the US. As its name would imply, Friday's also attempts to be the ""party night spot"" for drinks and such.  The drink menu is bigger than the food menu, and it's filled with a lot of tasty cocktails and such.  Some are unique to the UK, as you'd expect.  You can get a giant glass for £7-8, but drink it fast because they usually put a lot of ice in there!  There's your excuse to order more.  You're welcome. All in all, I don't think it's quite as good as the Friday's in America food-wise, but everything else is on par.  It's a great spot for a few drinks, but they don't take bookings so be prepared to wait on busier nights.  Not as bad as Hard Rock in that regard, though. No sense in promoting this place as it's hard to miss, but it's a pretty good ""we're picky"" or ""everyone keeps asking 'I dunno where do YOU want to go?'"" choice for lunch or dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

Interior is very similar to Hard Rock. The staff was excellent, from the time we entered the door until departure. Food was well prepared even if I did choose a messy burger. I was a wee bit disappointed in the choice of beers. Nothing exotic or exciting. I was really looking for a local IPA.

TGI Fridays was actually my favourite restaurant i visited in USA. The service, vibe and quality of food was pretty fabulous. So coming back to Glasgow just was not the same.

5,Sophie K.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",88,150,757.0,3.0,2015-06-30,"I have to admit, I was extremely apprehensive about coming to this place. We were a group of previous American studies masters students and myself (or, easier describable as a group of friends) and we seated at a booth table in the corner, under a huge red and white lamp. Walking in, it distinctly reminded me of the Hard Rock Café, but not so in your face.  We sat down, and personally I didn't think the seats were very comfortable and immediately my arm was stuck to the table -  ew, sticky tables.  While looking through the menus, our waitress whom I thought to be very brash and slightly rude, eventually took our drink orders (two of us had already received their bottomless cokes, but us girls ordered a big glass of rose for the Belgian friend, one large frozen strawberry margarita for my American friend, something the waitress loved to point out and a frozen raspberry daiquiri for myself, the German). My daiquiri turned out to be large as well, and my goodness, it was Large. To be honest, the drinks were expensive, even considering the size of them - not that this is something to complain about, but if I am spending £8 on a drink, I like there to be a hint of alcohol in it.  A long while passed, and she came back to take our orders. We ordered: a veggie burger, a well-done steak, a BLT chicken finger sandwich, a Jack Daniels chicken finger sandwich, and I opted for the classic cheeseburger sans tomato. Now, it was lucky that we had lots to chat about around the table because the food took at least 40 odd minutes to get to us. It also meant that by the time the food arrived, we were all actually hungry. My plate came with some sort of dipping sauce that looked like a cheesesauce. Turns out it was some sort of honey mustard, but not really but maybe something mustardy - but not awful. The fries were delightful. They were salty and fluffy and crispy and very, very tasty. The cheeseburger, arriving as requested sans tomato (big thumbs up for that), was good. It was dripping said honeymustard (?) sauce but it was not over powering. The patty slid around quite a bit so I cut the burger in half to keep some sort of dignity while eating it. The patty to brioche bun ratio was indeed acceptable, the meat was cooked well and all in all, I enjoyed my meal. The others also seemed to enjoy their dishes.  The bill came to just over £90, so I deem this place rather expensive. There was also quite a painful moment at the table beside ours, when the girl had to stand up, hold a plate when brash Glaswegian waitress shouted and clapped happy birthday at her. It was an undeniable case of Fremdschämen to me - I was awfully embarrassed for her. Brash waitress seemed to not realise that we wanted change and took her time bringing it back to us. On the whole, we saw very little of her - and that makes me think that paying £2.85 for bottomless soft drinks does not work (it does at other places, or in the states where people are usually are attentive or you are in control of your own drinks).  One thing I like about this place, although it's loud, I enjoy the music, it's a great combination of old school and classic tunes that reminded me of my past (in a good way).  In summary, I will say that I think I enjoyed my evening here mainly due to the company and being able to catch up with friends. I shan't not recommend (double negatives... oh no!) coming here, but I won't be rushing back mainly because Glasgow has places that offer better fayre for a lot less money too (student budget, people!), but I can't say I wasn't pleasantly surprised by the food (not the waiting staff or the random shouting and clapping of Happy Birthday. The poor girl).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

Let's start with the good first which was we got a table yay, everyone will know they are constantly busy and your lucky if you can walk up for a table. It took a while before we got asked for our drink request bit this was only an issue as I had a train to catch and didn't want a long winded affair. The longest wait was for our mains, none of us had ordered starters but for some reason it took ages. Once we got it my cheeseburger was cremated inc the cheese on top. I had two small pieces of onion and some white stuff under the cheese which I think was sour cream hmmm random. It was very dry and wouldn't get again. My mums meal was supposed to have mozzarella and she had two fingernail size pieces and that was it. My sisters massive hotdog was fine, my sister had no issues with that and you get a large amount of fries.

My mom had nachos as a starter and we found a sauce sticker inside. When my burger came basically it looked and tasted like a McDonald's burger... not worth the £12 price tag.

1,Becca W.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",55,31,28.0,2.0,2016-04-07,"Tried TGI's for a few drinks a week or so ago due to other people's choice... given the choice I wouldn't choose to go back in a rush.  Firstly I'm not too keen on how they work when you want to go in just for a drink. We waited in a small queue (which was fine and quick) to ask if we could be seated just for a couple of cocktails. Then, before anything else was said we were immediately ID'd. That's fine to ID people, especially as I'm aware it's 'think 25' and places have to ID, but we weren't 16 year olds trying to get in to get drunk. One of us was 26... anyway. That was fine but a bit odd before we even got to the bar. Then as soon as we got to the bar, which was about 30 seconds away, we got asked to show it again. After saying we just got asked, we still had to show again and the guy was annoyed that we said that. He then stared at them all for ages. Again, felt like 16 year olds so wasn't keen on that whole set up but if that's how they operate then fair enough. Now the drinks themselves: they're pretty cheap, around £6 for a small and some of them come in a large, which arrive in massive round glasses for around £8 which is pretty darn good. Unfortunately they taste cheap. I tried 3 different ones and they all just tasted like juice. Watered down juice as well. One of my friend's that I tasted (the lime daiquiri) was so weak but the only taste was weak alcohol, and next to no lime. Weird and not great. I wasn't there to get drunk but if you get a cocktail you don't expect it to be tasteless or taste like watery juice. All in all they were okay for what they were, and I'm aware it's a chain (a fairly cheap one) but I'm just giving my opinion on them as everyone raves about the drinks, so I expected them to be a bit better! I'm not really commenting about the food because I didn't eat that time, and haven't for a while, but from what I remember last time I don't think the food is anything to rave about either.  It's just basic, mostly not very exciting food. Basically if I wanted a burger, there's so many amazing burger joints in Glasgow now that I wouldn't recommend here.

There are so many more exciting places to eat now in Glasgow and when I think burger I don't immediately think 'TGI Fridays'. Anyway, she wanted to go and since it was her pick, I was happy to go along. It's not a bad place!  For a Sunday late afternoon/early evening it was pretty busy and really loud for that time of day (are we getting old? Perhaps!). It was just louder than normal and our initial reaction was to run and never look back. Then the drunken table of six next to us left and all was well again. Thank goodness for that.  I was really in the mood for a cheeseburger which was okay. Not the best burger in the world, but yummy enough. The fries were pretty good and the burger sauce is yummy. Decent meal but nothing exciting.  Service was okay.
