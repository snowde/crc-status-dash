My wife likes it but personally if I never went back I wouldn't cry one tear. The menu is way too big with pictures galore (always a bad sign), their drink menu is void of prices, they refuse to cook their burgers any rarer than medium-well (blech), and my dish consisted of small shrimps and grilled chicken with mashed potatoes and a ton of melted cheese (I like cheese so ok, at least they got that part right). It didn't help that our waitress was abysmal...when she was reviewing the drink specials she ignored the $3 draft beer and when I asked her about it she went ""Yes I'm ignoring it for a reason, that is a boring drink."" Uh ok. She was never around when we needed her and it took forever for her to finally give us the check.

56,Val N.,"Boston, MA",33,34,31.0,1.0,2012-07-07,"Worst service I've experienced since moving to Mass.  - server complained about one of her other tables to us - drinks and apps took a really long time, even though the place was less than a quarter full - share plates were full of water - we asked for waters (there were 5 of us) an she only brought one - they brought the entrees without clearing the app plates, so there was no room on the table, so they waited for us to stack the app plates and share plates to make room for them, then they dropped the entrees and still didn't clear the appetizer plates - she rolled her eyes at us when someone asked for a to go box & I had to stop her while she was running away to ask for one too -she kept reminding us that we didn't understand the difference between Korean and Mexican flavors and lectured us about it when we asked for another water (since one water for 5 people wasn't working out) - she dropped two steak knives on the floor while cleaning dinner plates and left them there, to my surprise when I went to leave the table and almost stepped on one The service was so terrible, that it started to become comical.

No busy so no excuses for poor or slow service. Food was not great but not bad. Steak was cooked to the right temp but sides were cold fries tasted like they have been siting for a good ten min at room temp (soggy and warm) shrimp scampi served with the shell on (really why if you can't cook grilled shrimp with the shell off and not burn it don't serve grilled shrimp.

If the food was terrible, this would be a one star rating. I will say the jack daniels mixed grill was pretty yummy. But the service, was absolutely horrible. This was around 10pm so it wasn't that busy. With how slow service was, you'd think it was a full restaurant. Not even close. It took 15 minutes for our waiter to come over and take our drink order. The whole time, the staff was just hanging out around the bar goofing off. After our meal, we decided to forego dessert and just have a quick shot of Bailey's and be on our way as we were tired. We placed our drink order with our waiter and he took off. Ten minutes went by and I saw that our order hadn't been placed. Then finally the bartender poured the shots and set them at the end of the bar, right in my line of vision. They sat there for another 15 minutes before the waiter finally brought them over saying, sorry they had to find another bottle to make the other shot. BULL!!! They were sitting there for 15 minutes while you chatted with your friends. Don't lie to me.

Open tables are lost revenue. Do they not have a busser? Do they not have enough wait staff ($2.89/hour... Add one).  20 minutes in, 3-4 parties have left, zero have been sat.

48,Kenz G.,"Providence, RI",0,1,,1.0,2016-04-12,"This is my friends favorite restaurant so we decided to go there to eat. Only my second time there. As soon as we walked in we were asked to wait 10 minutes because they were in the middle of switching out the old menus with the new ones. Giving them some extra time to make the switch we returned in 30, we asked about the new menus and they said they were giving us the old menu. We appreciated them making us wait for no reason *sarcasm*. We were seated at a very small table that we had to request a different seat. Once that was situated we ordered drinks and an appetizer. Drinks took long to come out and the appetizer took even longer. Mind you when the appetizer was brought to the table it was thrown on the table and the waitress sped off without giving us any smaller side plates or napkins!... After another 45-50 minutes the food came out and off the temperature seemed like the food was already sitting for a bit before it got delivered. During the meal we were only checked on once by the waitress and she almost forgot to ask if we needed any refills. I like TGIF overall as a franchise. But I DO NOT recommend this location, they have HORRIBLE customer service. Go to the Warwick location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-seekonk?start=40,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004
7,Richard L.,"North Attleborough, MA",0,258,,2.0,2016-05-14,"Disappointing experience First the good points. The Seekonk restaurant is bright, clean and inviting. The hosts and staffs were friendly. The lunch combo was ample sized and reasonably priced.. Now the bad. While the soup was okay the salad while large was not appealing. The chicken was served chilled, not stated on the menu, and the sliced strawberries were topped  with a glazed dressing/ sauce again not stated on the menu. I wish the server had mentioned the glazed when I had requested the dressing be brought on the side, which it was.  The TGI coffee which I use to enjoy has changed. The last two visits, here and at another location , the coffee was much stronger, I'm not sure if they are serving their version of a dark roast. I've been told each cup is brewed individually so I assume the coffee is premeasured and is fresh. When clearing my table the server asked if I enjoyed everything. I said the soup was good but not the salad. She cheerfully responded at least half the meal was good, lol. I also expressed my distaste for the coffee too. Friday's has many good food items maybe I picked the wrong entree.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-seekonk?start=20,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003

32,Natricia M.,"Windsor, CT",0,28,2.0,2.0,2017-05-06,"Where do I start with the blonde/brunette haired waitress with the gauges in her ears?  1. Budweiser is not considered a craft or local beer.  2. If 2 people get the $10 special with an additional $2 side of fries, the $35 bill should've looked odd to you before it was placed on the table. 3. If the customer tells you the fries are cold and return them just to receive more cold fries...they should be taken off the bill. 4. When you pick up the paid tab at the table, a ""thank you"" would suffice instead of picking it up, not saying a word and walking away, especially when the customers were more than nice to you despite your lack of skills.

The last time we went we waited almost an hour for a table, which was a first. In the past there has never been a wait, even on Mother's Day. We figured there must have been a special event so we waited. We ordered our food and once again waited and waited for it to come. We had to keep reminding our waiter to bring us the complimentary chips and salsa for stripes members as well.  One our food cake, two of our dishes were cold and one was practically inedible. My friend got the broccoli and cheese soup, which was brought to the table all dried up. It was like the broccoli had been coated with cheese and tossed in a bowl. It wasn't even soup!  She isn't one to create a scene and wouldn't send it back. We were also trying to catch a movie that night and was already running late at that point.

After about 5 minutes of waiting and watching other tables that were sat after us being served, our server finally came over.  Now, this is the one bright spot of the visit (reason they got 2 starts instead of 1), she was very quick and friendly.   When my JD chicken arrived I was shocked that for $15.99 the two pieces of chicken were extremely small (picture to follow).  However, the kids were happy with their food and mine actually tasted very good. Minutes after leaving the restaurant I received a notice on my smart phone that my credit card had been charged more than $400 dollars for our meal.  Since we were already on the way home I called and asked for a manager.  Although the manager was very friendly and upbeat he never once apologized for the error, but rather told me that they had entered the wrong amount and it would drop off of my credit card in a few days.  Granted it didn't matter to me in the grand scheme, I thought back to my college days when a $400+ charge on my credit card would've chewed up a substantial, if not all, amount of my available credit.   It will likely be a long while before I return to this establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-seekonk,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
