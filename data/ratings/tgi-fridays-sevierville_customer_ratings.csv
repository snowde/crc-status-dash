4,Matt D.,"Ashland City, TN",306,260,120.0,3.0,2012-11-07,"Went for late night food.  I will say for late night the service was prompt and the food good.  It is not often you can get good food late at night, around 11pm.  Other than praise for this it is the same as every other Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sevierville?start=20,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004

6,Drew C.,"Alpharetta, GA",1,74,2.0,1.0,2014-07-05,"I'm not sure if it's just this TGI Fridays or if they have all gone downhill since I used to go all the time. I got the jack Daniel's combo with the chicken and half rack of ribs with fry's and mashed potatoes. It's sad to say the most enjoyable part of the meal was the fry's and mashed potatoes. The half rack of ribs was mostly bone and fat where as at in most restaurants a half rack of ribs in itself will fill me up. The chicken was dry, and that was very noticeable even after covering it was the jack Daniel's sauce.  The service was nothing special, our server was very quiet and seemed shy. It was quiet when we went there and he didn't seem to be on top of things very well.  The only nice thing was the water we got to go since I walked to the restaurant from the hotel and it was a hot day.  Going to this TGI Fridays turned me off from going to TGI fridays. I may try a different one eventually to see if the entire chain went down hill or if it was just this one, but I don't plan on ever going back to this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sevierville?start=20,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006

3,Robert H.,"St. Petersburg, FL",0,5,,1.0,2016-07-30,"Wow. The dining experience there was absolutely atrocious at best. The waiter must have been in a horrible mood because I thought I was bothering with every question and request I had. I had not been to TGIF in years but had good memories of the excellent service and food I had years ago. There were many issues including my first beer which I had ordered a bottle and received a draft. Not much of a big deal I thought (LOL, I was wrong). That should have been an indicator. Next was the ordering of the appetizers. Quite simple, right off the menu with no special requests. Waited forever for them. Nice and cold when they brought them. When asked to make warmer, I heard the grunt and comment that "" I guess I cannot please these people"". LOL. We were just there for dinner. After that I just wanted to settle up and walk out, however, my wife is a little more understanding then I am. To make a long review short, Two of the three meals we ordered were wrong. We were hesitant to ask for them to be made right so we just asked for our sons order to be redone. He ordered shrimp and received chicken (I think it was chicken). Once again, the attitude was bad in getting that replaced. I think they had to go shrimping because it took forever as well to get that redone. I am totally disappointed with this experience. When I had stopped at the greeters station on the way out and expressed my disappointment, she simply looked at me and smiled like it happens all the time. I gave it a 1 star because the draft beer that I had was very cold. LOL. Maybe the bottles were not as cold and that is why they didn't give me hat I ordered as well. Would love to talk to Manager but never receive a call back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sevierville?start=20,,,,,
21,Four T.,"Fairview, OR",0,24,,5.0,2016-10-11,"Went to the bar late on a Saturday after arriving in Knoxville and driving down without all our luggage!

20,Brooke S.,"Summerville, SC",133,7,,2.0,2016-11-07,"Put in the dirtiest section in the restaurant. Let me insert that I've been working in the restaurant business since I was 16, one of the places being TGI Friday's. All the servers were sitting at one table socializing, no management in sight. I went up to go use the restroom and there were dirty dishes and trash on the POS stations, tables and floor leading up to there. I got an appetizer for my meal so I knew what to expect since it was fried, however my friend got the chicken club? The meat was grilled...but grilled and set aside way in advance. It was leather and extremely dry as was the bread. The waiter was clearly new, he offered a free recook or something different from the menu but my friend no longer had an appetite, no discount on check nor do I think a manager was told.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sevierville,,,,,
16,Taylor D.,"Naples, FL",18,101,50.0,2.0,2017-01-01,"Came here to watch the Dolphins game and obviously eat. Food was very good however server was a little late bringing utensils and napkins but food made up for it. The reason I'm only giving two stars is the male bartender with black hair was incredibly rude. Three, THREE, tvs had the cowboys game on all with views from the bar and he kept trying to change our tv from the Dolphins to that game. We told him we were watching and three tvs had the cowboys game on within view. He was incredibly rude about it and responded with ""you guys are leaving soon right?"" But hey screw it he was a terribly rude person and should learn some customer service. All three tvs playing the cowboys game could be seen from the bar. Absolutely bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sevierville,,,,,

This TGIFridays set the bar for other Friday's.  Ralphine was a huge part of that!  Thank you!

23,Niki C.,"Palm Coast, FL",0,2,,1.0,2017-04-10,"I do not even know where to begin. We were on our way back home when we notice a nail in my tire. Only place open to fix the tire was Walmart. So we saw TGIF right across the street and decided to eat there. It was around 11/11:15 when we went in. They just opened. Server came to the table ""we have coke products,what can I get you."".. not a big deal that he didnt greet us properly. We ordered waters (5 of us. 3 of us have been in the service industry for more than 10 years.), he comes back to the table, i noticed how the tray was about to spill and the next second it was all over one of the girls. We laughed about it (it has happened to all of us lol) he said ""and thats the worst thing that can happen"" then walked away to go grab towels. He didnt even apologize. We brushed it off and moved our seats. We then ordered. 2 got California chicken clubs with ceasar salad as a side, 1 a burger, 1 soup and salad and i ordered the spinach florentine flatbread and a salad.... we didnt think our day could get worse! 1 club came out with no avocado or yogurt aioli, the other club had no bacon, avocado or the aioli, my flatbread had just cheese and spinach (when a different guy brought it out he said ""bbq flat bread?"" I answered "" i got the spinach one"" he then said ""well whatever this is then."") Took us a few minutes to stop someone to get bacon for the 1 club (she didnt notice the other stuff until after). Once they brought the bacon she asked if she could get avocado also. I then had to get him again (since everytime we asked for something *3 items were butchered* he would just walk away) to ask if my flatbread was made correctly as it had nothing on it. He brought me a 2oz cup with tomatos in it (looked like pico with garlic) and no artichoke as the menu said. I ate 2 bites and felt sick. I think it was more i was so upset as to how we were being treated.... not 1 time did he apologize for the drink spill, not 1 time did he apologize for the food mess up, not one time was he even nice. Typically with so many mishaps i wouldve had a manager go over just to smooth things over. He didnt even have that happen.. I get it, we have bad days but this was just not okay. We asked for our checks and that was another hassle -_- they were all messed up. We were so over it that we didnt even bother to say anything, we just paid and left. Never in my life have i ever left $2 for a tip (my bill was $13 and change, yes 15% but i always over tip since im in the industry)  i debated on whether or not to review but i just had to. We joked about how good the service at Dicks Last Resort was because they are suppose to be rude. Lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sevierville,,,,,

18,Lisa D.,"Pauline, SC",0,9,,4.0,2017-06-15,We were there for lunch and asked to be seated outside since the weather was nice. This probably wasn't the best place to be seated if we wanted good service. The waitress only checked on us once and that was when she brought food the couple seated near us.

14,Marion D.,"New Castle, IN",64,6,,2.0,2017-06-19,"This place was terrible from start to finish. We were seated at a high top in the bar area. Our waiter, Patrick, was very rude and not attentive. I had the house margarita and it was disgusting. My partner and I ordered the endless appetizers, which were all cold and dry. This is nothing like the experience we've had at other locations. We waited for quite some time to get our second order, which was also cold. By the end of it, we were just ready to leave as quickly as possible.  Our main complaint was the waiter, Patrick. Terrible, if not the worst service we've ever received.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sevierville,,,,,
17,Arpita A.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,3,,2.0,2017-07-21,"So we went here on a Wednesday evening when we arrived in gatlinburg. Obviously being a tourist place we were ready to wait. Fortunately the bar wasn't full at all so we sat there and order food and drinks. To start it took the lady 10 minutes to even come to our side to ask our order. We ordered drinks first which took another 15 minutes to arrive. Then we ordered food which was great and tasty but still had to wait about 20 minutes for that to arrive. Then whenever we needed something like napkins, another drink, some ketchup we had to wait for her or wave our hands (rude but after five minutes of waiting you get impatient). She was the only one manning the bar and at one point the manager was back there but not helping anyone. Horrible experience they need more help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sevierville,,,,,
