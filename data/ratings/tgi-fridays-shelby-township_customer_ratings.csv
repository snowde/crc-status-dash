He apologized for the incident we had and he went above and beyond our expectations. He is the reason we will be returning and informing everyone we know to stop in and see Steve and Kyle. The other manager on duty was Frank and he was also informed of our incident and made it a point to check in with us as well. I have to admit, your team in Shelby Township made us feel like royalty.

The food came late but we weren't upset because we at least thought it would be good. WRONG! Our food was cold when she brought it to us. She asked us if we wanted plates and then never came by with them. After 15-20 mins of waiting for her to check on us she finally came by. We told her our food was cold. And she said she watched them hand it to her warm. We didn't eat the nachos and left them at the end of our tables. She did however say she would take back our fries and bring us a new plate. She then proceeded to avoid our table even after seeing the plate of nachos untouched. She never even came to refill our waters. Don't like the service industry? Don't work there.

8,Matt V.,"Sterling Heights, MI",3,2,,1.0,2015-02-06,"Sat at the bar on a Friday night. Nice atmosphere. Decent beer selection. We got the pretzel and craft beer cheese sauce dip appetizer. It was very tasty. If we had ended out night at that point it would've been a decent 3 star review and we would have not ruled out a return visit.  However we preceded to order dinner as well. Poor decision on our part. My girlfriend ordered a chicken and shrimp skillet and I a cheddar bacon cheeseburger. When I asked for it mid-rare, the bartender informed me that my choices were just ""pink"" or ""no pink"". Are you serious? An $11 burger that isn't made to order?!  Alas when our food came out it looked terrible. No care had been taken to how the food actually was presented. And when I cut open the burger? It was cooked to well done and then burnt extra just to make sure there could be no flavor remaining.  In summary, awful entrees & lackluster service out washed the decent appetizer.

38,Kelly S.,"Sterling Heights, MI",38,187,194.0,2.0,2015-06-06,"We've been going here for years but we have slowed down the number of times we go here simply because the quality of the food isn't keeping up with the cost. It's pretty expensive to eat here.  We went in Friday early evening after a very trying and long work week. I wanted a Sangria  but the $10.99 price turned me off. I thought about having a glass of wine but again all the 6 0z glass of wine cost around $10.50 - I have the $ I just think for the brand they were offering and for 6 oz that was too much money. I can go to plenty of other prices and order a 6 oz glass of decent wine for 7 to 8 dollars.  I settled on the drink of the day that was on sale/featured. I ordered the Blood orange cooler for $5.00 and it was very good.  We both ordered the Jack Daniel sampler which comes with ribs, chicken and shrimp. I've ordered this countless times and have enjoyed it.  This time the ribs had an after-taste, looked grey in the meat and didn't smell right. I only ate one and left the rest.  My mom asked for a side of ranch dressing and was given sour cream and charged 50 cents for it.   We liked our server, Stephani, as she was well-groomed, polite and friendly.  She messed up a few things but honestly we didn't care much because she was a sweetie.  Overall, it's just kinda expensive for what you get in return.  There are so very many other options on Hall Road to consider when it comes to a bang for your buck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shelby-township,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024

I worked a 12 hour shift that day I didn't want to move and sit by a bar but he kept asking me if I wanted to move. I got a breaded grilled chicken (it was topped with bread crumbs) with a side of Mac and cheese. the Mac and cheese was delicious!! But the grilled chicken was so dry I couldn't even eat it. I opted for a side of ranch and even after smothering with that I couldn't bare it. Also it took 5 minutes to get my ranch side which is fine but they were dead and I could see all the servers standing around talking. it's just rude. it took two seconds to get ranch.

My friend's brownie was interesting lmao but my Oreo madness was pretty good. We had Spencer as our server. He was very nice and pretty friendly plus he was cute:) Tonight was a fun experience but there were a few hiccups. My water was empty most of the time and I had to ask after about 40 minutes to have it refilled. And I felt like he was kind of rushing us out a little bit.

Due to the road construction on Hall and Schoenherr, it wasn't very busy at all so we were seated right away. Our waitress was Tori and she was great. Two people ordered the endless apps and one ordered an entree. Tori made sure to ask if we wanted to get the apps started right away or to wait for the entree to come out. They wasted no time in bringing out the apps and making sure the next app was out before the first was finished. Everything was delicious and hot when brought to the table. Drinks were always refilled promptly. This was a completely positive experience and of course, will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shelby-township?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
39,Billy R.,"Sterling Heights, MI",0,19,4.0,1.0,2017-07-09,"Boy has this place gone down hill. It used to be my favorite restaurant, but keeps on getting worse each time we visit. The only thing that keeps this restaurant open I believe is their Jack Daniel sauce. Before everything on there menu was amazing and fresh. Now their chicken is frozen that they just zap in the microwave. If it ws a fast food that's acceptable, however for $20 each meal, not so much tgifridays. Both the hubby and I had the JD chicken meals and Cokes, for $40 we could've went to a way nicer place that serves FRESH food. Won't be surprised when this chain goes out of business",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shelby-township,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
23,Erika V.,"Saint Clair Shores, MI",61,101,18.0,1.0,2017-07-16,"The past few times I've been in here it has been slow, slow, slow. Today kinda takes the cake for slowness. I'm actually here right now and apparently they only have 3 servers. They're not filling in all the tables because of this. You would think that would make it okay but it doesn't at all. They didn't bring my drink until I was done with an app and also soup! As a disclaimer I ordered a tea that had to be made behind the bar. Wish I had asked for booze in it to make this experience a little less painful. The waitress is trying to tell us that she has to go give birth at 9pm....wth? It's 8:15pm. We talked to the manager and this last app took 25 minutes..she would not make an exception to give a box and really didn't seem to care about our experience.

6,Samantha K.,"Roseville, MI",0,2,,1.0,2017-07-23,"To start off the place was almost empty but there was a wait due to being understaffed. They told us the wait would be 20 minutes and that they only had three servers. As a server I understood and we decided to wait. Then we hear the manager tell another party that they had two servers and one walked out, meaning there was only one server. The man called the manager an asshole and walked out. So we didn't end up waiting very long. When we were sitting waiting for a server I could clearly see there were at least four servers. Our server Alec had no manners whatsoever. My friends ordered two appetizers to share and he replied ""endless?"" It was obvious they didn't know what that meant but not once did he try to explain it. So we ended up over paying for an appetizer. Then the worst thing was at the end. My boyfriend payed with a card. So we know how it works they swipe the card and we get a receipt back to sign and tip. He didn't give us the receipt to sign. I know very well that he could have forged his own tip on there. So I went straight to the manager. Overall not great and I feel bad for the Host. Super sweet and polite but had to work at that shit hole.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shelby-township?start=20,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
27,Aaron M.,"Charter Township of Clinton, MI",0,5,1.0,1.0,2017-08-06,I haven't been here for a while so I decided to go today around 3:30pm. Most the place was empty but of course we needed to wait 20 min! Drinks were not picked up the whole time and couldn't get refills. I ordered and never received the rest of my meal! Just leaving at 5:30pm. Orders were all wrong and we were charged $7 per soft drink we ordered! We talked to the manager and were only offered excuses because the general manager just left early. Come to find out we had a new server and no one has trained her yet. She came in for training and they had her go live without anyone helping her. Offered no compensation or bill adjustment. We just paid and left.  What a joke this place is. Will never ever be back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shelby-township,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
30,Jay A.,"Macomb, MI",0,11,1.0,1.0,2017-09-14,"Not a great lunch today at TGI Fridays. What used to be a staple for us has turned now into a probably-won't-do-that-again location. Service was attentive and quick, as was the kitchen, but the place was empty midday during the week. Wife ordered the grilled chicken caesar salad but with ranch instead of caesar dressing, and with it on the side. I ordered the turkey avocado BLT sandwich with the pesto aioli on the side. Food arrives quickly, which was pleasant. However, the caesar salad came out doused in caesar dressing. Anyone can make a mistake, she sends it back and a prompt replacement arrives - no issues there. Not sure if it was rung in incorrectly or if the kitchen botched it, but they fixed it quickly and accurately and that's the best you can hope for. My turkey and avocado sandwich came out, looked pretty good but the kitchen again forgot the aioli on the side. Not a big deal, asked and answered quickly, no problem. After a bite or two it just seemed off to me still. Hmmm...well, crap, no bacon, WTF? It's literally right in the name of the sandwich. I decide that at that point I'm pretty well done sending things back and asking for dressings and such and will just eat the sandwich without the bacon - my heart probably thanks me for it. The meal after that point is going well until I get to about 4 bites from the end and proceed to pull out a 3"" long piece of plastic wrap which had lodged in my teeth. I'm guessing that it came off pre-shredded bagged lettuce or something like that - at least that is my hope. Okay, enough is enough, I'm calling it a day at that point. Server comes over (#850 - Tyler), I inform him of the issue, show him the plastic, confirm that it was indeed in my sandwich. His reply: ""oh, geez, sorry about that. yuck"". Then he asked if we wanted dessert...I'm sure he was just uncomfortable with the issue and just went back to the script, but come on, really? I indicated that I was not interested and just wanted the bill. He neither offered to send over a manager, remove the item from the bill, nor anything else. I was a little gobsmacked at the response, but at that point I just handed him my credit card and had him run it so I could end this lunch and clear out. Should I have made a bigger deal and let the manager know about all this debacle? Probably, but I didn't. Any restaurant can screw up, but I think that the total experience may have turned me off to TGIF completely at this point. Hopefully your experience will be better than mine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shelby-township,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
3,Crystal H.,"Macomb, MI",0,1,,1.0,2017-09-24,Absolutely horrible service!!  Got seated right away -wasn't even acknowledge by our server till about 10 minutes later.  Brings 3 of the 4 drinks & says the bartender will bring my child's root beer.  15 minutes later she comes back and says that they do not have root beer.  We didn't get our order till 30 mins later    Order was wrong.  She forgot the sides for my salad and dressing was on the salad when I asked for it to be on the side.  Kids chicken & fries were cold.   She refilled our drinks once.  I had them remake the salad and got it to go.  I Couldn't even eat with my family cause they were finished & I still haven't gotten my meal. I had to get up to see what was taking so long for my 2nd salad - to ask for a box & to get our bill-because our server NEVER came back!   The manager was kind enough to ring me up -get a box & to take the salad off my bill.  I get to the car and realized that we were charged for both kids drinks. So I had to go back in to get that adjusted.    The sad thing is -they weren't even that busy.   I've never had such horrible service!   1st time EVER that I left a restaurant without leaving a tip!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shelby-township?start=20,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24

She looked straight at my fiancé's empty glass at least 3 times and never offered him a refill. If we didn't have a gift card to pay with I would be furious.

22,Joseph K.,"Fraser, MI",25,196,40.0,2.0,2017-11-06,"Another disappointing experience at what used to be an exceptional franchise. I suppose yelp and other similar sites are partly to blame for the decline in chains like TGI Fridays.   People know to look up a restaurant before they go to eat there, and you can't get by on brand recognition anymore. 20 years ago a restaurant like Friday's could count on return patrons who didn't know better.  That simply isn't the case anymore. The dining space hasn't been updated in at least 20 years, and it shows. The tables, chairs, and other accoutrements have a worn out look to them.  Even the random crap on the wall looks like it's been there for a while, maybe that's the point? Our server was certainly polite, but she had simply too many tables to keep up with and didn't get back to us to offer up after the meal had started. It took longer than it should have for food to come out, and the food itself was nothing special either. I ordered a turkey burger with a side Caesar salad. The turkey burger was reasonably season, and flavorful. The salad was a disaster. Uninspired lettuce, miniature cheese crumbles, and dressing that didn't taste right. My kids all ordered hamburgers, they looked OK, but nothing special.  My wife ordered ribs, these actually look pretty good, but they were tiny. For nearly $80 total you'd think we would've been happier with our dining experience, we weren't.  I'm afraid we won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shelby-township,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16

24,Carter N.,"Marysville, MI",1,31,,1.0,2017-12-11,I am between a 1 and 2 star. Arrived tonight and the place was awkwardly empty. The decor looks dated back to the 90s. My wife said there was no toilet paper in the rest room. The men's rest room stunk. The place just had a dingy feeling. We sat down and I was not greeted for close to 15 minutes. When a server finally came we ordered waters. She returned holding the waters with her palms on where we drink. It was absolutely disgusting. The food was very underwhelming for the price.

I got mashed potatoes on the side instead of mac and cheese. They were good.

21,Stephanie B.,"New Baltimore, MI",56,299,324.0,2.0,2017-12-29,"My Aunt and I stopped here for lunch the other day. The last time I was at a Friday's was probably at least five years ago. Nothing memorable then but I'm always optimistic in giving a restaurant another chance. The only reason for our visit was because my Aunt received multiple gift cards for Christmas.  We got seated right away and the first thing I noticed was how incredibly cold the restaurant was.   Now it felt like negative 10 degrees outside but the restaurant had cold air blowing nonestop. Several patrons were dinning with full winter coat and hats on.  We started off with the pretzel and beer cheese appetizer. The cheese was luke warm and the pretzels were burnt on the outside but raw in the middle.  I ordered the Mac and Cheese burger with a side of French fries. Easily the worst burger I have ever had in my life. Didn't have high expectations but I was hoping it was going to at least be good. The burger patty was significantly smaller than the oversized Mac and cheese patty. Both were overcooked and dry. Honestly would have been better if it was actual Mac and Cheese topped upon the burger and not a frozen Mac and cheese type patty.  My Aunt ordered the chicken and cheese dish. Quite large with veggies and potatoes and a few pieces of chicken but she asked for no onion and her dish had onions all over it.  Service was really sloooooow. We were promised refills on our waters before our lunch arrived but never got them. Took forever to get the bill. Over all around just was not a good experience.  Our meal was almost $40 for an appetizer, two entrees and one pop. $13 for inedible burger, no thanks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shelby-township,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
