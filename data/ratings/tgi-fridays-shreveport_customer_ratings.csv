20,Jon S.,"San Antonio, TX",0,19,2.0,1.0,2013-04-30,"This place was absolute crap.  The only good thing was the nice service. However, I paid $16 for a plate that was 96% empty, and consisted of a piece of chicken smaller than the palm of my hand and about 1/4"" thick, six ""jumbo shrimp"" which were about popcorn size, and a side of ""Parmesan steak fries"", which was a whole three fries covered in oil and some cheese.(Which actually arrived after everyone was done eating). My other side was a side of cole-slaw, which I received one mouthful of. One of the biggest wastes of money in awhile, I will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shreveport?start=20,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000004
23,Amy Z.,"Shreveport, LA",9,39,1.0,1.0,2013-07-24,"My last visit was a joke.  I arrived with my friends at a little after 9.  There were a ton of tables open.  After watching two hostesses laugh and giggle for a good 10 minutes, one of them wiped down a table near the door.  The floor underneath the table was filthy, and so were the seats.  I politely asked if we could wait for another table, because that one was in a cramped location and I was there with three fairly large men. (Mind you, there are more open tables than not.)  The hostesses said okay, acted annoyed, and then were laughing behind the podium, this time clearly laughing at my friend and I.   About ten minutes later, they bring us to another table.   This one was cleaner....but not clean.  Our waitress comes out and is actually very friendly.  She brings us our beers and they taste awful, like the lines are filthy.   The food was terrible.  My friend's steak was about 30% fat.  It took forever for us to be served dinner, although I will admit, it seemed to be the kitchen and not the waitress, as she was checking on us often.   My only complaint about our waitress is that we told her that the beer was undrinkable (we didn't drink it) and she still charged us for it and didn't do anything to rectify it.   In short, I will never eat there again. Even for chain casual dining standards, this was awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shreveport?start=20,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000005

16,C. L.,"Bossier City, LA",1,30,73.0,5.0,2015-03-10,"I visited tgif on Saturday, I got Jack Daniel flat iron with Parmesan steak fries and mac n cheese and I asked for MEDIUM RARE, when it arrived it was better than I thought it would be! I was between rare and med rare! Our waitress was nice and always checked on us! Management was walking around talking to everyone and I think this is the BEST SERVICE that I've experienced in four years from this place! New faces= better service! Awesome!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shreveport,,,,,
24,G T.,"Bossier City, LA",21,2,,1.0,2015-04-04,"Ok this is the third time I came back to TGIF, but I think this is the last time for me and my wife.  The food is good, usually, but this time the boneless wings were cold, and my wife had ordered just the Jack Daniels burger. We waited and waited, finished the appetizer, and were still waiting, our waitress served the table next to us, did not acknowledge us, we had to finally get her attention to ask about the burger. She said the appetizer always came out first...duh! She went to check on it and brought it out. Finally. We left once before when we got our drinks and did not see a waitress at all aftef drinks arrived, for 25 mins, so we saw the manager and asked for the price of our drinks, and we left. Ridiculous service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shreveport?start=20,,,,,
12,Michael T.,"Bossier City, LA",43,107,192.0,2.0,2015-05-06,"Getting about tired of this place, how the mighty have fallen. Seated myself in the bar at a small booth during lunch. Place was pretty slow considering.  Service is so hit or miss, this time a miss. Bartender seemed rushed/bothered to wait on me, again only 1 other group of diners in area at time. The really annoying and unprofessional part (unsure where manager was, or if part of it) was the conversation coming from kitchen area (right behind bar). Waiters/kitchen staff spoke very loudly, laughing, joking, cursing etc etc. Seemed more like a hang out session than any actual work. I am glad they work well together and have fun, but the entire dining area doesn't need to see/hear it as well and in their playing around diners were neglected. Ordered a burger, which was cooked very well done, had good flavor overall. However , was bit wierd when literally 1/3rd of my burger fell out of back of sandwich on my first bite, as if placed on bun in pieces.  Overall, you can't get to enjoy a menu item as they will remove it new menu update, service is spotty and food usually tasty just poor preparation techniques.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shreveport,,,,,
19,Stacy W.,"Laredo, TX",1,3,2.0,1.0,2015-05-19,"The worse service, food was cold, couldn't find a waitress, drink refills didn't happen and when they did they were wrong, manager took 20 mins to come out and that's only cause my husband made her come out!!!!!!! They have fallen to the do not go eat ever list!!!!!!! 3 hours at a restaurant was not the way I wanted to spend the day!!!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shreveport,,,,,

17,Andrea F.,"Shreveport, LA",258,1,,1.0,2015-07-19,Horrible. A waitress asked a customer to take his shirt off to show his tattoo in the middle of the restaurant. They were also out of 2 out of the 3 things we ordered.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shreveport,,,,,
22,Jessie N.,"Delhi, LA",0,2,,1.0,2015-07-24,"We had to move sections due some language from another group in our section. We sat around for 1 hour still had no food, and refills were slow.

3,Benetta P.,"Shreveport, LA",424,355,2837.0,4.0,2015-08-28,"Our waiter was great, he visited our table just the right amount for me. The sliders were good, but the bread..bun, was too hard, like they sat getting air too long. I did not complain nor send them back, as I was not in the mood. The jack Daniels platter was excellent. The boneless chicken was great, the shrimp was great, the BBQ ribs was great. I am a huge jack Daniels sauce fan.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shreveport,,,,,
18,Jes-a-saur M.,"Hollywood, FL",8,23,5.0,1.0,2015-09-02,"This place is always empty when driving by even during peak lunch hour and saturday nights when it should be packed, but we thought we should give it a try anyways. There was only about 10 other people eating lunch here at 12pm on a Tuesday.  We were seated right away in a booth.  The table was dirty and sticky and the booth was sticky too. We ordered and it took over 30mins to get our food (the place was still pretty empty) I ordered a Jack Daniel's burger. The meat was very dry and had burnt black flakes all over it. The meat was suppose to be cooked with the Jack sauce,according to the menu,  but instead they just smeared cold jello like ""Jack Daniel's"" sauce on one of the burger buns, really? The fries were suppose to be seasoned but weren't and were cold. The parmesan chicken was grilled chicken with a ton of sprinkled crumbs on top, not how it was described in the menu. They also drowned the mac and cheese with the parmeason crumbs, it was very dry. Over all I see why this place is deserted! Don't waste your time, go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shreveport,,,,,
13,Richard T.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,17,,1.0,2015-11-29,Terrible service.  Took 10 minutes before our server showed up.  Food came out after 30 minutes.  Server was very bad.  Forgot drink refills and condiments.  Food was very bland.  This place is managed very badly.  Take me for my word this place is beyond subpar.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shreveport,,,,,
8,Kate M.,"DeRidder, LA",6,87,107.0,2.0,2016-04-19,"When we walked in the young gentleman greeted us right away, very friendly and courteous- asked if we would like a table or a booth. Table please. He said great because all our booths are dirty. And they were- and they stayed that way throughout our entire meal, and were still dirty when we left.  Must be a stand-off of who is doing tables this rainy Tuesday! 6:00 Tuesday and the place was a ghost town. The host and our server were the only 2 people I saw working while I was there.  Probably about 6 other tables with guests.  Ashely was our server- and after waiting about 10 minutes for her to visit our table, once there she did an ok job, a little slow to check on us- etc, but when she did she was friendly. And she brought extra napkins without me asking for them- which is a plus.  I had soup and a salad, hubby had JD chicken.  The food was good, not piping hot, but warm.  Would I come back- probably not. There are just too many other choices nearby to chose from.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shreveport,,,,,
5,KEVIN F.,"Shreveport, LA",9,108,93.0,2.0,2016-07-08,"My visit was at 3:30... a likely time to find any restaurant a ghost-town.  It was especially so, here.  So much so, that I wondered if the place was even still open for business.  Only 4 cars in the surrounding lot. I swore off TGI Friday's about 10 years ago, when the San Diego location I frequented, began deep frying their breadsticks in rancid oil.  I knew that was the chain's ""jump (of) the shark"". Fast forward to yesterday:  Understaffed, though I know why (few patrons).  Tables of dirty dishes from previous meals.  Standing on the floors wasn't possible without my feet sliding out from under me... due to a greasy solvent-slick on the floor. Food wasn't bad, but not good.  Chips & salsa served with undercooked (improper low temp) greasy chips, and a generous two tablespoons of salsa.  I was offered more salsa, and had to take them up on it 3 times.  Flavor wasn't bad, but far from vibrant and remarkably little heat.  I stopped with that, thankfully.  My friend had a meal, it seemed he liked... but it was kinda sad.  A once vibrant chain, with loyal customers, now a shadow of its former self.  No longer a fun environment, but a lesson in consequences... when you kill your golden goose. Regrettable, and a distinct reminder of why it'll be another decade before I try again. Friendly service, but only a shade off a total fail.  A generous two stars, for the kind service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shreveport,,,,,
9,Amber T.,"Waco, TX",0,24,63.0,2.0,2016-12-03,Noone greeted us when we walked in. Finally a young server greeted us and sat us. We sat down and the table was dirty. Once we ordered the food took awhile even though the restaurant was empty. I ordered the grilled chicken which was burnt. The only good thing was the server working her tail off.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shreveport,,,,,

6,Christian U.,"Bossier City, LA",7,12,5.0,1.0,2017-03-11,"Food took way too long and not up too par,  so I send it back at this point i was not even hungry any more and I was afraid it was going to take another 45 minutes manager never visited the table to see what was wrong I counted 3 managers on staff, I can go on and on, but the fact that a visit was not pay means management is the problem with this place, do not come here to spend your money its terrible and you will be unhappy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shreveport,,,,,
11,Dana C.,"Central, TX",0,1,,1.0,2017-03-12,Waitress was good considering what she had to deal with from the kitchen and apparent lack of good management.  They were out of something another person ordered.  Found that out when we were ordering.  Then found out about 20 minutes after ordering that they didn't have any sliders that I ordered.  Everyone's food took forever to be delivered and it didn't all come out at same time. Ordered potato skins and they were horrible. Restroom door didn't have a lock.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shreveport,,,,,

1,Lexi M.,"New Orleans, LA",0,6,5.0,2.0,2017-05-05,"The server was the reason it got 2 stars. Food was blah, atmosphere was not your usual tgi Fridays vibe.  The manager the night we went, seemed to have some sort issue and it seemed to reflect on her staff. Maybe it was an off night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shreveport,,,,,
10,Jacoria K.,"Arlington, TX",0,6,8.0,1.0,2017-05-14,"Had a very bad experience here yesterday. I understand that graduations are happening and it is also Mother's Day weekend but there was no excuse for the terrible service we received. My party of 6 arrived at about 10:15 pm. We were told that there would be about a 10 minute wait for a table. Once we were seated, we waited another 6-7 minutes for a server. I noticed that our server, Dusti, was sitting in the corner and sluggishly got up and walked over to us and said, ""what y'all want?"" Being a server and noticing all the open tables in the restaurant, I asked if they were short staffed, she told me no they were all just tired and ready to go and didn't want to take anymore tables. We then asked if they were about to close and she said yeah the kitchen closes at 11:30. Which we later found out was a lie and that they didn't close until 1am. We went ahead and put our drink orders and meal orders in all at the same time. Our drinks both alcoholic and non-alcoholic took more than 15 minutes to receive. We weren't given an explanation or a reason as to why they took so long. We all got endless apps. We didn't have any silverware. We got our food at 11:20 and remember we were told the kitchen closed at 11:30 so we tried to go ahead and put refills in but our server was back sitting in her chair. She finally comes back over and we put in refills. Drinks were getting low and she never offered to refill them. Plates were stacking up on the table and she never offered to remove them. But she did make the comment about how the busser needed to be fired. She kept trying to cash us out while we were eating and we finally said we were ready for our checks. On a side note, I watched her sneeze into her hand and continue to touch stuff right in front of us. The food tasted good but I couldn't even enjoy it due to the poor service. Probably the worst server I have ever had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shreveport,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
2,Chelsea C.,"Barksdale Air Force Base, LA",35,18,,1.0,2017-06-04,"Worst restaurant experience I've ever had, hands down! They don't even deserve one star.  Our waitress, Melissa was inattentive at best. She hardly checked on us at all, our drinks sat empty for several minutes, she didn't write down our orders, forgot things we asked for 3 times (one of which she forgot about not once but twice) and has zero sense of urgency. Perhaps waitressing isn't the best job for her. On top of all that they were out of several items we asked for including their signature dishes. We overheard the people next to us order different things than us that they were also out of. The surrounding tables sat dirty for a good ten minutes after other patrons left as well. I've always been a fan of Frdays, but I can assure you we won't be returning to this location ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shreveport,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
