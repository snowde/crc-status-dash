182,Crissy L.,"Rockville, MD",2,8,,5.0,2012-01-23,"This review is for the BAR and Happy Hour. Ok, ok, I know I am definitely biased. My roommates and I come here around twice a month because it's close to our house and has a pretty good happy hour. The bartenders are SO nice and will always make you something special. Sometimes it gets really crowded, but usually we can find seats at the bar (there can be up to 4 of us that go) if no seats at the bar, we can always find a table in the bar area. When they have the 2 for $10 or 3 courses special it's perfect to share and a great deal.  With that being said, YES it is a TGIFridays. So...could they have healthier options? Sure. We would love that sometimes. But the bartenders and staff here are so great I just can't knock a star off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-silver-spring?start=180,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998
216,Carlos L.,"Silver Spring, MD",27,12,1.0,1.0,2012-01-26,"i Went there last night to have dinner with my wife and the service was horrible. The waitress was prompt on the first set of drinks and appetizers but from there on out she would ignore us. We got our food about 30 min after we recieved our appetizer only to have my pasta served cold. I asked her to please have the cooks warm it up, so she took it too the back and I didnt ever get my food back after that. By the time my wife finished eating I wasnt even hungry anymore so I politely told her to not worry about it and to take it off the check. She took another 10 minutes to do that I then gave her my card to charge which took another 10 minutes. During the time I asked her to have the cooks warm up the food she would help every other customer except us, from bringing them new drinks to there entreee as well. After all this I login to my back account and see that she charged me 15.00 extra on a $20.00 tab. I will be returning today to speak to the manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-silver-spring?start=200,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002

He was very dry, and didn't seem happy to be working.  Lucky me, I got to sit right next to him...and his speakers. :-/  As for the atmosphere, it was a lot less crowded for me b/c I came in at the tale end of happy hour.  However, if you are planning on getting in at the bar/bar area(which is the ONLY place the happy hour prices apply), you'd better plan on getting there right at the beginning (4-7)   It's a great place to watch a game.  Plenty of tv's.  The drinks are nicely priced, with a healthy amount of alcohol.  I didn't get any food this particular night, but I usually can't complain.  Guess it all depends on what you're in the mood for....*definitely wasn't in the mood for a dry-ass trivia dude in my ear, that's for sure*.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-silver-spring?start=180,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508
170,Diane Z.,"Laurel, MD",0,14,,1.0,2012-03-04,"It took 2 hours for lunch! I have been here a few times with my coworkers. There is a girl there who is a bartender and works the high tops during lunch on most days for at least the past year. I think her name is Ayana (her name was on my last check but I know some places bartenders will only clock in under 1 name). She is truly the worst server EVER. As I have mentioned in my past reviews, I have worked as a server and I am pretty understanding because people have off days. Ayana always comes to the table after a good 5-10 minutes after you sit down. She NEVER smiles and always looks like she hates that fact that you are there eating and bothering her. She takes forever and always forgets at least 1 thing.  Last time I went she charged me for a soda that I didn't get and completely forgot that I ordered desert. Worse is when I went up to her, she didn't even apologize for her mistake! Hey, you made the mistake not me. The MOST DISGUSTING thing that she did, which made me write this review, is she was rubbing her eye the WHOLE TIME she was talking to me when she brought me my new check. DISGUSTING! Something was wrong with her right eye and it was like shut, but she kept rubbing it. This is a BIG no no and totally grossed me out. And she never got me my dessert, I had to ask the manager to bring it out. WORST WAITRESS/BARTENDER EVER!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-silver-spring?start=160,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308

120,Tiffany L.,"Silver Spring, MD",275,275,646.0,3.0,2012-08-29,"Ive been here several times and sat at the bar and dining area. Bar experiences have always been good, they have always been busy at the bar area. The dining area has been a little slow at times but still okay. The food is standard to TGIF. Sometimes the food does look a little old and lazily put together. I think they should try to get the cooks to pay attention to orders (read reviews of orders being made wrong) and presentation.  I'm giving this place two starts because of the food. My sister has a very mild shrimp allergy. She ordered the chicken and shrimp Alfredo without the shrimp, she always orders Alfredo everywhere she goes. Seemed easy enough but when the food arrived it came with shrimp. Because she had a very mild allergy she was able to pluck the small shrimps out of her dish and discard them. I actually ate a shrimp and I wasn't sure if it was cooked or not.. Scary. We aren't the type to complain at allll so we just went on with out meal. The manager came over semi frantically to ask how was everything. It seemed like he may have known they messed up. Being the non confrontational customer that my sister was, she just said yeah it was fine. If she had a severe allergy to shrimp or nuts or something and didn't see it and ate it they would have been in bigggggg trouble. My sister, and TGIF, lucked out that this wasn't a huge problem.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-silver-spring?start=140,2.28,2.28,2.28,2.284,2.28

210,Lady Phade 1.,"Olney, MD",70,78,30.0,1.0,2012-11-10,DO NOT EAT HERE! I think the only reason this location stays in business is because of the popularity of the name. Slowest service ever accompanied by overpriced bland american food at its worst.  I am sure you can find something decent on the menu but the prices will not match and the service will have you feeling as though the meal should have been on them.  Our waitress had no idea about any the drinks or foods we asked her about-she stated to us she had been working there for 4yrs-that was no big deal-we let that slide BUT it took her 45minutes to bring water and oops she forgot the water and just brought a glass with ice in it.  She let us know she would be right back with a bottled water..she came back with a soda for my friend and forgot the water.  Half an hour after that..the bottled water arrived around the same time the food did-after appetizers and all-she forgot all the substitudes on the main meals we asked for.  She brought every meal out at different times.  As you looked around -it was the laziest slowest service all around I have ever seen.  Management needs to step up here.  The 6.00 bowl of soup is about 3-4 slurps.  You would think the portion would be bigger than the side soup but its the same.  The french onion soup tasted like salt soup with canned onions dumped in and a clump of processed cheese attempted to be melted on top.  Go down the street to Panera bread and less you will get a bowl three times the size with more quality ingredients.  HORRIBLE FRIDAYS LOCATION!  My co-workers have eaten here many times since its the only thing around and they complain about it every time after coming back to work.  IT WILL TAKE HOURS FOR YOUR FOOD TO ARRIVE!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-silver-spring?start=200,2.32,2.32,2.32,1.956,2.32

It was the typical evening crowd - pretty packed, but not really. Our server took our orders, but didn't bother to write them down. That was a warning sign for me; I've found that servers who don't write orders bring out bad orders (obviously) or just try too hard to seem as if they know everything. Both are terrible in my book. Sure enough, when everything came out - after about 20 minutes - they got my dad's order wrong. The guy who brought it out took it back but nothing happened until our server came around 10 minutes later to apologize. We waited around another 15 minutes for the correct entree to come out. Once we got the check, I saw that they had still charged us for the wrong entree!  Let me say here that the last time a server got my order wrong, she didn't charge us for a drink as a way of making it up. This guy didn't even try to make such amends, and instead still left the incorrect order on there. I was already planning on leaving no tip, but this made it even easier.

The staff is really friendly, and there isn't a weird vibe or nothing. Relaxed, and the drinks are yummy as well. I recommend this Fridays, it's not off the chain like Rockville, but at times it is, but it's good if you just want to go out on a Friday night and chill.

First, the service is lacking. I've come here during a quiet Friday afternoon when the place was nearly empty and had the same inattentive service I've had on a hopping Friday night. Additionally, the servers aren't as polished as I'd expect. I still expect a certain level of service and quality to my interactions with people, regardless of what they might assume about me.  I much prefer sitting at the bar area, which has an interesting set-up. The bar itself is in the middle of the room with the tables forming a horseshoe around it. It can be a bit awkward because you feel like if you look across the room you're staring at another table, but I think it offers a good measure of privacy among the parties on your side of room. The food is standard -- it's Fridays.  I haven't had any terrible or amazing things to report about the food because I expect a baseline of quality that is usually hard to miss.   Apparently they offer karaoke on Wednesdays ... sounds entertaining, but I think I'll pass.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-silver-spring?start=160,2.6,2.6,2.6,1.9960000000000002,2.6

My Jack Daniels chicken sandwich is a fat girl's dream, with cheese, bacon, and onion straws. I thought it was decent, even if the chicken breast was kinda small.

OK we waited about ten minutes while two workers stood at the hostess stand talking then they finally said ""oh are you ready to be seated""? We were ready when we came in. Once we were seated no one came by to take our order or give us menus. My coworker asked someone where our waiter was and he said she would be there in a minute. By this time its been another ten minutes and we decided just to leave rather than wait place an order and have the food take forever.

154,Tim H.,"Silver Spring, MD",28,115,6.0,2.0,2014-05-04,"This is about fries and why they matter. I begin with a confession:  TGIF's Sedona black bean burger is one of my top vegetarian indulgences.  It's really good!  Really! And this from the folks who bring you Jack Daniels branded ribs!  I'm awfully grateful that TGIF brings its A-game to the vegetarian options. I've been to this location more than any other and have had a wide variety of strange service occurrences, everything from orders not being right to no silverware to inaccurate checks.  So there's a good bit of disorganization here, but frankly everyone has been nice and nothing was ever really a problem. I've noticed the amount of fries has decreased over time.  This to me is more serious. Consider:  big chains have some really large margins.  Think about the spread they earn on non-alcoholic drinks alone.  The prices here are inching high-ward and that's okay so long as they are otherwise generous with the customer experience.  For example, it's more okay to charge $3 for a soda if it has free refills, even if you don't get $3 worth, because it gives you the option to have more of what you enjoy. Fries are cheap.  TGIF is not increasing its margins all that much by skimping.  Yes I know that with their volume the little things matter.  But it reveals that they're nickel and diming me.  Fry quantity is a sign of good faith -- it says, yes, we're making a profit here, but you're not going to leave wanting more of this really cheap thing that you enjoy. Skimping on fries is subtracting quite a bit of enjoyment on my part for a very small increase in their profit.  Bad move.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-silver-spring?start=120,2.44,2.44,2.44,1.608,2.44

144,AJ M.,"Burtonsville, MD",25,16,,1.0,2014-06-21,"Literally every time I come here it is a disaster. I want to say ""haha jk"", but I have been here maybe four or five times and each time a tiny little piece of me dies. The staff is mainly teenagers and nobody seems to take much seriously. I guess because every day is Friday there. Basically, the underlying problem at this location, for me, has always been a strong lack of discipline with the staff and really poor situation management. One time, we made a reservation over the phone with a hostess for our friends birthday. Inexplicably, he wanted to go to TGI Fridays to celebrate. We arrived only to find out from (presumably) a different hostess that they don't take reservations, and that we don't know what we're talking about. Yeah, we must have called the Fridays in an alternate dimension where the staff knows what they are doing. They ended up seating the ten of us at two separate booths with a giant wall between them. We were forced to split our group in two. What a fun way to celebrate a birthday, by dividing their loved ones in half and shoving them into a couple of poorly cleaned booths. No apology for the inconvenience, no manager to calm us down- just the unrelentingly average experience of Fridays, with half as many people to commiserate with. Also, why can I not order a burger that isn't well done? Do their microwaves not have a setting for medium-rare? Incorrect food orders happens every time I go. I'm not one of those people who makes it a point to tell the server how ""every time I come here they get my order wrong"" because it probably won't stop them from screwing it up, and will probably just make them feel too awkward to come check on you after they inevitably screw your order up anyway. It really happens every time though. Probably the most fun part of coming to this restaurant is betting on which part of the meal they will get wrong, and having everybody win the bet because they mess up every course. This place is probably perfect for a younger crowd who hasn't figured out that you get what you pay for. If you just turned 21 and your overpriced Long Island is more important to you than your service or the quality of your food, this is definitely where you want to be. Not only are the Long Islands way overpriced, but those other two things don't even exist here.  The best thing I can say about this restaurant is that they stopped coloring all over their uniforms with glitter pens. On the downside, now you can't tell immediately after walking in how immature and undisciplined this place is. You'll have to take a few steps over to the hostess stand to figure that out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-silver-spring?start=120,2.32,2.32,2.32,1.6680000000000001,2.32

There was only 1 thing that I thought was lazy on their part but understandable. 12 of us came here after church and was seated after about a 5 minute wait. I never got the name of our waiter but he says ""Hola"" to greet us. He's a very energetic and outgoing guy so that was good because we were all having a good time. When there's a group of us out at a restaurant, we always have a good time no matter where we are. I guess it's not hard to please me. The Hola guy was prompt and made us feel comfortable. We ordered our drinks first then our entrees after. Before he left to put the orders in, I asked him if he could make separate checks for 9 people. He said okay. We got our drinks around 5 minutes later which wasn't bad considering how busy they were. And we got our food maybe around 30-40 minutes later. I got their Jack Daniels Burger, Medium Rare with fries and JD sauce. I also got the Whiskey Cake with a shot of Baileys for dessert. My brother got the Oreo cake which I had a bite of. Everybody else got whatever they got and for the most part enjoyed their meals. The burger was flavorful and even when the burger was well done :( it was still tender. Just not really juicy. The fries were pretty good until you dip it in the Jack Daniels sauce and they were even better! The dessert was good too. When you get your spoon and get a little bit of everything then consuming the delicious mess into your belly; from the cold ice cream to the warm and fluffy toffee cake smothered by the alcohol and fudge. Delicious. I also had a bite off of my brother's Oreo cake and it was pretty good. It's more like an Oreo ice cream cake. Then when we got our check, it was 1 check for the 12 of us. I guess he was either lazy to make them all separate or he didn't have time or what but it took us like 20 minutes just to handle the check efficiently. We had some Math Majors in the group and it was tough for them to do the math between 12 people. I should have taken a star off for that BUT it didn't take the fun away because while we were waiting, we all were just having a good time. So Mr. Hola guy, you were lucky this time! :) Out of a 275 dollar bill, he got a 70 dollar tip. I was too busy having fun that I didn't realize the decor of the place, the little specs of food under the table on the floor or how they got some of our orders mixed up.

179,Rene R.,"Baltimore, MD",19,177,,2.0,2015-04-07,"Review based on To Go order experience - I was on hold for a few minutes and then Renee took my order. Pleasant enough. When I got there  the entrance was clean and the host was polite. My food was ready when I arrived and I was in and out in about 5 minutes. That was all great. I ordered the Jack Daniels Chicken with Mashed potatoes and broccoli. When I got to work to eat, I checked out the food and there was no JD sauce, the chicken looked a little well done and the broccoli was perfectly steamed.  Unfortunately the chicken was only done on the outside and the broccoli had no flavor. And I couldn't eat the potatoes because I was unaware they were cooked with cheese (the online menu didn't mention that). And it would have been 10 minutes more to get a different side. Overall it was a disappointing experience. Especially because I love the JD sauce. Even if the broccoli has no flavor, it can be dipped into the JD sauce. Must learn to make that stuff myself. I will say that when I called and spoke to a manager I think his name was Robert, he was very nice and took care of it promptly. That I really appreciated.

With their returned endless appetizers offer, I decided it was worth a revisit especially with my parents who had never been.  For $12 per person, my parents learned that american cuisine goes beyond ginormous burgers and steaks. Props to our waiter, Israel, for continuously replenishing our orders - 12 platters of Mozzarella sticks, BBQ chicken flatbread, chicken tostadas, boneless wings (Memphis BBQ. Parmesan garlic), and my old time fav - potato skins. I was a bit bummed that they were out of bacon mac and cheese bites - but nothing an extra order (or 2) of BBQ chicken flatbread couldn't fix! Although we enjoyed the food and service, we only see TGI Friday as ""once in a few year"" treat  - I think I woke up three times from indigestion that night.  My no longer teenage stomach might not show as much love for TGIF as it used to but my heart still agrees TGIF as her fav American chain around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-silver-spring?start=40,1.92,1.92,1.92,1.6480000000000001,1.92

95,Puff P.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,7,,1.0,2015-07-08,"Where do I begin?   After a softball game and grocery shopping, my fiancée and I decided to stop by for a beverage or 3 and some food.  Friday's always has some type of mix drink specials and $5 apps that made it seem like a sensible choice.   (Disclaimer: we have been to this Friday's a few times and always got good service from the bartenders.) The reason for the disclaimer is because I wanted this review to carry merit from our multiple experiences with Friday's, and to inform the readers that what is coming next will be real.  The few times my fiancée and I were there, we notice the patrons are what brings this place down.  If you read my other reviews, my baby and I like to frequent dive bars mostly, and bars the have good eye candy for all. Well not Friday's (at night). Friday's has always been a sausage fest, but that is no big deal because I bring my own sand to the beach.  The main problem with this is the low rent mentality that many of the patrons seem to display. Once again, didn't really bother me much, because I have my lady with me and as long as they leave me be, I have no issues.  However, with this mentality in the air, it's easy to see that this place would only get worst.  With all that blah blah said, let's talk about last night.  We walk into Friday's around 10pm, and mofos are fighting in the bar area!  Grown a$$ adults literally fighting. You would think at this point, I should leave...nooope not us, we take our seat at the bar and watch the crowd of people run, rumble, and work to push the disturbance outside.  MoCo's finest finally show up and control the situation. I know it's wrong for me to blame Friday's for their customers actions, and what we gathered, the staff did jump in to attempt to control the situation.  However...here is why Friday's got one star.  - because i couldn't rate them a zero - because the LACK of control the manager possessed with his employees.  Allowing employees to still run their mouths about the situation long after the police had dissolved the situation did not make the remaining customers night better.  Allowing ALL your bar employees to stand around while the police are there and the customers needs become second or third.  - because if you (manager) are going to allowing your employees and involved customers sit around talking about it, YOU CANNOT SIT AROUND AND TALK ABOUT IT WITH THEM.  - because Friday's allow kids (under 18, but we also saw kids under 12) in the bar area, even after this fight.   - because EVERYONE knew each other. Meaning, if you have approx 30 people in the bar area, and ALL 30 seem to know each other by first name, including the manager, there is something wrong.  We love dives and respect bar personnel creating a family atmosphere with everyone knowing each other.  this is normal and appreciated by us. Friday's though?  It's not a dive, and how do you get so friendly with patrons that look to barely be over 21 (questionable).  Following a fight, this lends me to believe that week in week out, these same folks are at Friday's.  - because the manager allowed the other patrons (ones that seem to not start the fight, but took pleasure in jumping in to throw punches and kicks, to stay in the restaurant.  I feel all involved parties should have been asked to leave immediately. Get the negative vibe out and show that crap will not be tolerated, regardless of fault.  - because after the fight and all had cleared (11pm), the doors were still open like nothing happened, and all we saw were more MFing young a$$ dudes coming in. I feel the doors should have been locked at this time especially 1045-11pm. No new customers, and allow existing customers to complete their meal with peace of mind. (You don't really get to relax when you overhear the manager telling his friends/customers that the assailants ran away. One with some common sense would feel a little threatened that someone could double back, re-enter with the intent to cause serious damage or get revenge. Who knows? But lock the f'ing door.  - finally, because we will never go back. It's a shame too, because it's right up the street from our house.  Their food is consistent and special are ok. They offer music and good people watching.  The shame comes from the lack of authority there and the feeling of a free for all.  - this place needs security just to give the presence of authority. I know anyone that reads this review may be foolish enough to think that race and/or sex strongly influence my review. Noooope, wrong. If that was the case, I would not have returned after a few visits. We have tried to give this place a chance, only to be disappointed with the bullsh*t from the restaurant not being able to get out of its own way.  I will end with this. If you work everyday for your money, have love for people, and enjoy the simpler or fancier things in life...avoid this place. If you are a b*tcha$$ and a low rent simpleton. This place is for you.

The Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta was okay. Not the best that I've had but it was edible. Sloppy presentation.

I have been to this location twice before with slow, iffy service, but hey gotta give a place a chance right? Not for this location.  Worst meal and service I feel I have ever received at a restaurant.  When my boyfriend and I arrived it was 7pm and were told that to be seated in the dinning area it would be 15 mins.  No problem.  The hostess seemed nice and less then 15 mins passed and we were called up, great.  When we were seated it took a few mins for our server to reach our table to tell us he will be with us in a minute.  We had noticed it was somewhat busy and we were still debating on what we wanted so that was ok. 5 more minutes go by and the waiter puts two glasses of water on our table and leaves without saying a word. We waited patiently for our waiter to come by to take our drink order, he walks by taps our table mumbles something and walks away.   Finally he stops by and takes our drink order, at that time we had been waiting 20 minutes. 20 MINUETS to place our drink order.  I order an unsweetened iced tea and my boyfriend gets a coke.  We also mention to our server that we are ready to order, I ordered a burger and he ordered some ribs.  He nods and says he will go and place the order for us. Eventually brings the drinks we ordered without a word again and leaves.  55 minuets later, as we sat with absolutely nothing in front of us, no refills, and a quiet dismissive passing comment of 'your food will be out soon' from our server. Our food arrives.  It was repulsive.  My burger was sloppily put together and had obviously been sitting for ages. The cheese that was spilling out the sides of my burger had solidified. Oil and other juices had pooled at the base of my burger; I touch it and it is luke warm. My fries that are room temperature have soaked up the juices from the plate and are soggy. I'm normally not picky about my food but this was bad.  My boyfriends ribs are burnt, dry and without sauce at all on top.  We would have sent the food back if we weren't starving. So we started to eat.  The bun of my burger was solid. Everything inside had coagulated and the meat was so well done they were tough pucks of beef.  This was THE absolute worst burger I have EVER had, I ate what I could and left most of it in a pile of mush.  Our server never asked how the food was or checked in on us.  But finally he stopped by at around 8:30ish to refill my boyfriends coke and we asked for a check.  We knew it wasn't worth complaining to anyone, none of the servers seemed to really care.  So we waited another 5 minuets for our server to ignore us and eventually return and ring us up, we paid for our worst meal ever and left.

After we set down ordered our first appetizer raspberry iced tea and water with lemon. Specifically told him to give me the raspberry iced tea when my appetizers come, but to give me the two waters with lemon as we wait. About 10 minutes of waiting. I noticed our server Mr. Damon, was not in sight so i kept trying to get the waitress attention that was just finish taking someone's order. She looked me dead in my eyes and walked away without acknowledging that I called her. 2 minutes later, Mr. Damon showed up, with my raspberry iced tea and no lemon water. Tells us that our food is coming up. I had to remind him to please give us the lemon water. 25 minutes passed  (The only reason we stayed cause we was hungry and the other closes Tgif would be in Largo town center.) When we finally got our food Mr. Morris that was a general manager gave us our food.  Mr. Damon return a second afterwards with water without lemons. It seemed that he caught an attitude when we reminded him wheres the lemon. Once we was done with our first Appetizers. It took 15 minutes just to get his attention again To make our second order. Another 15 minutes for refills on drinks then again no lemons in which she had to put the used lemons from before into the new glass of water. We watch a couple that came there after we ate our first appetizers. Got there appetizers and there entre, When still have yet to get our second appetizers. When he finally came to give us a refill, we asked him why is our food taken so long...he says they don't have a food runner today so food is taking long and walked away before we can ask him what he meant...came back 15 minutes saying what did we order cause i forgot to write it down.  After we told him what we wanted for the second time. We had to really grab someone to get a got damm manger to make a complaint. Mr. Mark A. Morris Told us that we aren't normally this slow to plesse bare with us. When we told him how that people that just getting there was getting there food first. Mr. Morris replied back saying that. Whoever order goes in first get there food first. After that walked off. 10 minutes afterwards  Mr. Damon give another couple there entre that came there 5 mintues after we talked to Mr. Morris. Finally after waiting 20 minutes giving me my two plates. Had to wait 10 minutes for my woman to get hers n three minutes for our drinks. When we asked for our check and to get an order of what we had previously ordered with a soda to go we kindly asked for.our check. It took 20 minutes to get the food but instead of in to go containers it was plated. We did not recieve our containers. My fiance asked for the containers in which he shovee them into her face. She then again asked for the check and he uses slang referred to her as ""Baby"" highly unprofessional. He gave us the extra sauce after our initial third round was recieved and he completely ignored us. We waited another 15 minutes to get our credit card back.

I have not visited a TGI Fridays in many years, and I doubt I'll visit again in the near future. My memory of the menu includes large, flavor filled burgers with excellent toppings, steaks that did not need to hide under sweet sticky glazes, and a pleasant atmosphere. Based on yesterday's visit, only the pleasant atmosphere remains.  My burger was dry and crumbly, and was topped with an overly salty pepperoni marinara sauce which I had to remove. My son's steak- ordered without sauce- was also dry. While this is partly because he ordered it medium well, he's eaten many steaks cooked to that temperature that maintain their flavor. I was thankful that I'd ordered the green bean fries, and my son came home and made himself a bowl of soup. This visit was a good reminder for me that I am not the target demographic, and that a menu based around foods that taste good with a cold beer are not my preference.  The burgers I miss were a build your own concept. I remember having a nice list of available toppings, and I was able to choose four. TGI Fridays was the first restaurant where I could reliably order guacamole for my burger, so I did.  Guacamole, black beans, sautéed onions, and bacon. This was 30 years ago and I still remember begging my family to eat at your restaurants when we spotted them during our travels.  I'd love to see a pared down portion of the menu that did not depend so heavily on sauces and party tricks.

My boyfriend and I came here to watch the Warriors and OKC game, but unfortunately management does not work to satisfy customer needs. Almost every single person here wants to watch the game and although the the sound of the game is on, they are playing Pandora for whatever odd reason and the music is much louder than the sound of the game. Maybe if management would work on PLEASING the CUSTOMERS, they wouldn't have 2 stars. They have been failing at this for years, new management has come and gone, yet they continue to fail.

Having been coming here for years, I can attest to the decline in service over the years. Again, it's close by and easy to stop in and just grab a drink. I won't necessarily recommend it for a special occasion or anything like that. I tend to sit in the bar when I'm here and even when it's slow, I've found the service horrendous.  During my last visit, I was sitting in the bar and wanted to partake in the $12 dine and drink deal which I had recently done at this very location and in the bar. Well this time around, I was told they no longer honor that deal in the bar, only in the dining area. What foolishness is that? Ok fine, we'll move to the dining area, no problem. I ordered the petite sirloin with two sides and a drink for $12 (yes not a bad deal, right?!) However, my steak was well done and I had ordered it medium. This is not the first time I've experienced this here. Well since they can't un-cook it, I tried to eat as much of it as I could but I felt like I was chewing leather. I'm so serious!!  Good thing, I wasn't starving, but still... I have stopped by here late on a Saturday night and it was a lil turnt (in a good way!!) so maybe that's what they're good for!

And we were ready to spend money since we were about to order 3 entrees, 3 appetizers and drinks and I would def force them for a dessert as well. A nice greeters/host met us with smile and being polite. No complaints about them. We got seated to the booth. And then we were ready to order. 5 min. No one coming. So our friend went to the host stand and asked if anyone gonna take our order. So the hostess came she apologized and said that they are ""kinda busy, but she can take our drinks order"". And we are starving. And the section where we were seated was empty. Only us and 1 more table which is finishing up. It's still a mystery for me how our server is busy? Same as other 5 servers passed us by (I get it it's not your section) but they didn't seem to run around like they are busy just walking. Same as I would say it's not a full house it's 60% capacity. So after all that time I would say 15 min. I have decided to put a timer on just for curiousity how long it will take? And guess what I see, the  server walking to the door, the host tells her to take our order and she (server) points at us with her hand and makes a facial expression like she doesn't give a damn about us, I looked her in her eyes and she saw that I see her, she takes off her apron and walking out. I understand it's midnight. Maybe she was working a double idk. But since I am working in very busy restaurant myself I know how it is. So even if you don't feel like working on Friday. And don't wanna take a table. At least don't stand in the middle of the floor and don't point out at the customers! Especially when they see you! This is so disrespectful! I am from New York and honestly when my family (all the way from Russia) comes visit and we go to stupid times sq. and then to eat at Friday's, the service over there is way faster, on a Times sq., the busiest tourist place in the world. Mb it's not that clean and shiny on a times sq. But in term of being really busy but still serving fast and with no attitude they are def. win! My advice, Please fire this girl cuz she is obviously not happy with the job she does. So give her a favor and end her torture. Horrible experience and it's ridiculous that we end up being hungry cuz of one stupid person who doesn't wanna do the job. We left, my timer was showing 10min.

Lets be honest its TGIF food its not going to blow you away. But, with all their rewards and promotions on food you won't be spending a lot. I recently stopped by with some friends and ordered the endless apps. They make each person pay the $10 for the apps promotion. We had the BBQ chicken flatbread, pot stickers, fried green beans, mozzarella sticks, and boneless chicken in Jack Daniel's sauce. Food took a while to come out about 15-25 mins every time we needed a re order on apps so I recommend re ordering every time they bring out the food. Staff here is always friendly and attentive.

67,Tyneka R.,"Silver Spring, MD",2,6,3.0,1.0,2016-08-18,"I've been to this place serval times and it seems like the service is getting worst. When you ask questions about drinks the bartenders make it a point to say ""you cannot send it back."" The first time it happened to me, I was EXTREMELY confused because my intention wasn't to send the drink back, I had a question about the drink menu. It's almost like they assume the worst from there customers. Did they feel like I didn't have the money to pay for the drink?? As a customer felt insulted.  Another incident the waiter attempted to refuse my friend service because they had a driving alcohol restriction on there license. The waiter was so rude and it was clear that she got it from by her discourteous manger, Herman.  He claimed that its Fridays policy, but could not display this policy anywhere in writing or explain it efficiently so it was atleast half way believable. We literally had to show them the Maryland.Gov website and explain the license (which is something they should inform employees before work the bar area) before my friend or our party could get any type of service. After the misunderstanding there was no apology from manager or server of their incompetence. Instead, they repaid us by late food and few to none visits to the table. She pretty much just made us feel unwelcome for the rest of the night. So much so I inquired several times if it was possible that we could change waiters.  If I was to give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe not serving to driving alcohol restriction ID is in there policy. And that's okay if that's their policy! My critic however is on how it was poorly handled. One person having an ID issue should not effect the entire tables service. The employees training on customer service or conflict resolution was unapparent. It was so bad I had to step outside to gather my thoughts on what the real issue was. I was so disgusted during my past visit that I couldn't order anything past a glass of water, which is nothing like me.  My impression is that this location has an discriminatory undertone. They will go above and beyond to make you feel like an unvalued customer. This place gets one star because usually when I go I enjoy the music. Probably won't go back until they change management.

We came in and already knew what we wanted. We were greeted by one person who informed us he was not our server, and there in the middle of changing shifts but he could get our drinks. Ok fine we ordered our water and waited... And waited...(20 mins later) we had to stop a server passing by and ask them if they could take our order or get our server. The first server comes back and takes our order and says it will be out shortly. 30 mins passed and we still hadn't even gotten our apps yet. At that point we were already annoyed.  Finally our apps and entree come out and everything that could be wrong was wrong. The pasta was dry, like Sierra desert dry. The appetizer sampler that we got was blah. The pretzels were dripping in grease, mozzarella sticks were soggy from the pretzel grease and the potato skins were as crunchy as potato chips.   We informed our server who then got his manager. Manager took the apps back and took it off the check and remade the pasta and offered us dessert on the house. I accepted the offer and got the brownie obsession (just a warm brownie and ice cream) I thought it would come out quickly but that took 20 mins as well.

First, all of the available tables were dirty or had glassware stacked on them. I had  to ask our server who never introduced herself or I would name her, to wipe off our table, she still proceeded to place the menus on top of the dirty table. We asked for waters at first and she brought us waters with no ice, when it was 90+ degrees outside. I assumed the ice machine the broken because when we ordered our bar drinks she asked if we wanted ice. Had to ask for ice in our luke warm waters she brought. Our bar drinks never came after over 20 minutes of waiting. We see our server making other drinks and she brought us app plates but no drinks. No word on where our drinks are, then we see a bartender on her phone and the MOD just walking around nonchalantly. At that  moment we decided to leave. My wife being the attorney she is wanted to speak to the manager. He blew her off and then the server came out, throwing up her hands and yelling at my wife like she had  done something wrong.

Both times it's wasn't very busy once at 2pm and the day we went at 1pm. Both times it was my chicken dish that held everything up.  Do NOT get the chicken sliders, they are horrible. Just bland breading with super dry chicken inside and fried to extinction. This last time I had the chicken Caesar salad hoping that would be faster. Wrong! Still took forever. It was fine, nothing special and not worth getting again.  If my lunch break was only 30 min I could never eat here. You legitimately need over an hour to get lunch which is absolutely insane.

I ordered a truffle burger. The waitress (who was excellent) asked how I wanted my burger cooked. I asked for medium. The problem (and irony) is that you can't cook frozen patties that way so when the burger arrived well done I was not surprised. What I thought was an attempt at a decent presentation turned out to be because the burger could not stand on its own. It was too slippery. The burger came with snow white lettuce and a soggy bun. The melted cheese had also seeped onto my lukewarm fries. The burger also left a funny after taste long after my meal was finished.  You add this to recent experiences at other Friday's, one of which included a bar tender at the Friday's in White Marsh, MD that preferred to serve his ""regulars"" 3 and for 4 times before getting to me and my friends, and you can see why Friday's is unfortunately now dead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-silver-spring?start=20,1.72,1.81,1.81,1.604,1.7740000000000002

Our food came shortly after and it was pretty good. As my mom and I dined I glanced over at a nearby table being cleared by what appeared to be a manager and waitress. I didn't think much of what was going on until I notice the manager take a glass filled with water and ice and pour water on the table. She then proceeded to wipe the table with the spilled water and set it up for the next customer. I found this to be completely disgusting. Not only did she not clean the table with any type of cleanser, but she did this all right in front of a restaurant filled with people!

He came back a few minutes later with straws, but no plates. I reminded him of the plates and asked for the cheese dipping sauce that comes with the pretzels- he insisted that they don't come with anything but finally agreed to get me some anyway. 15 or so minutes go by and he comes out with our mains.

15,Phillip R.,"Silver Spring, MD",41,3,,1.0,2017-06-25,"So we arrived for a mid-day meal and walked out.  The management does not know how to manage or simply has no support from ownership.  Here are the facts:   1.  The hostess on duty greeted three sets of customers with inhospitable attitude.  The restaurant was barely a quarter full.  Other staff were standing around.   Test the hostess stand was jammed and the hostess insisted on starting a wait of ""at least ten minutes.""   If she had been friendly maybe this would have been acceptable but given that she could not smile, walk with any urgency or care that 12 nice customers were waiting to be seated, she simply represented a belief that the customer does not matter.   2.   Multiple front of the house staff were simply standing around doing nothing and never stepped in to help the hostess.  Perhaps they did not want to be there either and knew the manager on duty could care less.  3.   When I asked to see the manager on duty and politely told him why we were leaving and I wanted him to know since there was no manager in the front of the house, he responded with ""you don't even know why I am in the back of the house.""   I did not debate the question and just walked out.  The answer is clear enough.  Management at this location prefers to hide in the back of the house and avoid customers.   This was an ok location but I must say it does not deserve any business whatsoever.   The customer is not first here.   The management hiding from customers comes first.   And the employees suffer because no one is training them to run a customer friendly establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-silver-spring,1.48,1.8,1.8,1.3160000000000003,1.6720000000000002

I corrected him so he apologized and removed the wine AND glasses, bringing over a Perrier but no glass from which to drink. I ordered a burger and asked him to swap out the fries for sauteed spinach for which he informed me there would be an up-charge - I approved. A man who I later was informed was the manager (?) brought our entries but mine had the fries but not the spinach so I corrected him - and he said he'd bring the spinach but never returned to our table. When done with my burger I called our server over, explained the missing-spinach scenario for which he apologized, noting that the man who'd brought our entree was the manager! I was eventually served the spinach when my burger was finished. When our bill for $42 arrived (the 20% coupon had been applied) we gave him $60 in cash for lack of the correct amount plus a tip. The server kept the $18 tip and did not return to the table! We asked another server to send over the  manager who never appeared.

It's always really bad waitress service and the food takes forever to come out. It seems like they are under staffed or not properly trained because it's the same issue everytime. The waitresses are usually always nice which is good but the service is really bad. The last time I went they took forever with our food, also my appetizer came out with our food which makes no sense because we ordered it separately in a decent time frame. Also after receiving our food our waitress was yet to be seen anywhere. Their staff does not seem to work together either because since our waitress were no where to be found I asked someone for utensils because none were placed on the table when we were seated she said she would get them but continued to do her thing and then eventually asked someone else to get them. In other restaurants when I have asked someone other than our waitress for help I have gotten helped from the person I asked so that is just terrible waitressing. Again the waitresses are polite and friendly but that is not enough, I think this restaurant needs more staff or better trained  staff. This restaurant has good potential because the location and food are good but I decided not to try to give this restaurant another try because I always get disappointed.

Stood in the lobby for literally 7 minutes before anyone addressed us as a manager talked on a phone and a hostess walked back and forth from the dining area to the lobby refusing to make eye contact or speak.   Was finally seated and waited an additional 10 minutes for someone to come over and take our order in a restaurant that was less than half full. After 10 minutes a guy that was training a young lady on how to use the cash register/ordering system, comes over and announces he is actually our waiter.  Did I mention we were on our lunch break? 25 minutes after being seated, we finally got our meals in a half empty restaurant. I gave up on trying to get a refill for my tea.  The only plus was, the waiter allowed my guest to order her refills on her AYCE appetizers all at one time. We would have been there all day if he had not done that.  Did I mention the restaurant was over half empty?  P.S. one family came in for a celebratory event and was seated in our section and left after their orders were not taken after being seated for 15 minutes.

I placed an online order thinking it would be easier since it was a larger order. The online set up was inconvenient since it didn't let you edit, add comments, or alter an order so any additions to a burger was not an option. Anyway I called them to confirm they got it and the host just seemed confused and couldn't comprehend what an online order was. I stated I had to add minor things to certain items and she asked if it was already paid for. Well of course it's already paid for... that's the only way you can do an online order. I get there and automatically the host didn't come off very welcoming especially since we didn't have the most pleasant phone conversation due to her stupidity or lack of knowing about an online order. Almost everything was bagged except 3 items. I asked her if those 3 items were mine (since I didn't want to accidentally take someone else's carry out order and she said, ""I don't know it might be, figure it out"" and walked away. Extremely rude and unprofessional. Shouldn't ever put someone like that in front of your establishment to greet the guests. The food portion was tiny I guess because it's a carry out order.

Food took forever. My girlfriend got her meal a few minutes before the apps came. Her sandwich was pretty bad. I had endless apps with boneless chicken. Was good but I immediately asked for a reorder as well as more sauce and more ranch. I didn't get any of that until I asked three times and 2 different people.

8,Kurt S.,"Fairfax, VA",0,9,,1.0,2018-01-01,"Don't eat here.  Dirty and bad customer service.   Two friends and I decided to pop in for dinner on a Monday night.  Walked into the restaurant and despite it being pretty slow it took about 5-8 minutes to be seated.  The hostess didn't even acknowledge us for about a minute after walking in because she was complaining to another hostess about how busy it was earlier in the day and that she almost decided to quit.  After she was done with her rant, a second hostess said she was going to find us a table and never came back.  Finally, a third hostess showed up and decided to seat us. We sat down at our table, table was dirty, crumbs everywhere from prior customers.  Two of our three menus were soaked, like someone spilled drinks on them recently.  We were already not impressed with the service and disgusting state of the menus and table. We ordered three waters. When waitress came back with our waters, one had a crumbled up piece of paper (like a receipt or pocket tissue) mixed in with the ice.  We were disgusted and walked out.   Unsanitary restaurant and horrible service.  TGI corporate needs to make an unannounced spot check on this restaurant and prob needs to change the management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-silver-spring,1.52,1.71,1.71,,1.6340000000000003
11,Tanya G.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,2,,1.0,2018-01-02,"Bad experience  from the time I got there until I left k was not pleased with the service at all. This Fridays has fell off drastically from when it first opened. I don't come as much but try to give a chance here and there but I'm truly disappointed and may never go back. My daughter wanted to order the endless appetizers. The menu which she received listed the appetizers as we knew to be $10. When the waitress came she informed us they were no longer $10 and it was only 5 not what was listed.  So of course because that is what was stated in the menu and that is what she wanted I requested to speak with the manager. Of course I expected someone professional to discuss the matter with. I understand it was cold in the 20s outside but I would expect the manager not to be dressed in a hoodie with logos all over it. He agreed to give her endless apps at $10 not $15 which it was supposed to be but I had to argue with him over giving her the bbq chicken flatbread as an appetizer because it now is not part of endless apps but because it was on her menu felt she should have if that's what she wanted. Well he agreed to order and pay for it no charge to me. My friend ordered a drink but sent back glass was dirty. We ordered a new menu item Bucket of bones - half slab of ribs, 10 wings and fries for $18 figured would be enough to share we received what could of been a kids menu. Everyone in my party drunk water, drink was sent back so Bucket of bones $18 endless apps $10. Why did our check come any say $53.19? So many mistakes not pleased at all not returning!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-silver-spring,1.52,1.69,1.69,,1.6220000000000003
5,Luke K.,"Royersford, PA",0,8,,1.0,2018-01-06,"Stopped in for lunch on Christmas Eve Sunday, 2017.  We were seated immediately but then waited a good 15 to 20 minutes for our waitress to appear.  She took drink orders and we were ready to order our meals.  My grandson ordered wings, my son a sandwich, a side order, and a cocktail,  and I ordered a salad with chicken.  Ten more minutes before drinks showed up.  Meals another 10 to 15 minutes.  My grandson's wings were okay, my son's sandwich not so good, and my salad had chicken that tasted reheated, not fresh.  My son's cocktail and a side order of brussel sprouts showed up when we were about finished eating. The place was less than half full and the service was terrible.  Never again for any TGIF.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-silver-spring,1.52,1.68,1.68,,1.6160000000000003

9,Tia N.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,2018-01-10,I ordered through Uber Eats and received extremely poor service. One of my sides that I paid extra for was missing. The medium steak I ordered was cooked well done instead and was very hard to chew and cut through. I tried calling the restaurant but instead the employees kept putting me on hold and transferring me to different people. I had to wait for 20 minutes total. I also had to hang up and call again in order to FINALLY speak with the manager. Never will I ever order from TGI Fridays again and I will also be complaining to corporate.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-silver-spring,1.52,1.65,1.65,,1.5980000000000003
4,Edward N.,"Phoenixville, PA",0,23,4.0,1.0,2018-01-12,There is a reason why this place has 2 stars in fact that's overrated if there were negative stars I would give it  minus something. 1st let's say the service is terrible we waited almost an hour without any attention for a simple dinner also the big problem the noise was incredibly high volume no need for that in the bar area stay away from this place.

0,Nees F.,"District Heights, MD",0,9,5.0,2.0,2018-01-13,"Listen, this place is just....ugh. If you come here during lunch time (11-3), don't even expect to be served in a decent time. They're always taking forever around this time. You'd think an establishment would make sure to have enough staff to service a lunch rush.  The waiters are okay, but they try to finagle you out of money. If you order the endless app, you get charged for another if someone else eats off your plate. First of all, I didn't know that. Waiter never told us. Secondly, they were made aware we only ordered one app but refused to remove the other app charge from the receipt. Annoying! It's safe to say I won't come here anymore. This isn't the first time this happened.  Now the manager is getting rowdy, and being aggressive talking about police. We're talking calmly to him, but he's got an aggressive tone.  Don't come here. That's all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-silver-spring,1.32,1.63,1.63,,1.5060000000000002
