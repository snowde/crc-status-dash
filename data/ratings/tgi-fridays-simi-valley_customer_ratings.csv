212,Kyle C.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,16,1.0,1.0,2012-01-30,"Just awful. I've been in other TGI Friday's before and they're at least decent. This particular place need to be bulldozed and rebuild because it looks like a dump on the inside. That said, even a major renovation to the building probably wouldn't save this place. Service is nonexistent, food comes in five different varieties of terrible, and the atmosphere reeks of douche. One thing that is consistent with this location and other Friday's locations are absorbent prices. There is literally nothing fresh in any of their food, it's all frozen and reheated, and they don't even taste good. The drinks are weak and overpriced as well.

I honestly don't know what to say about this Friday's restaurant.  I was extremely shocked at the customer service here as well as the cleanliness.  I've been to other Friday's and all of them have been very nice.  I know Friday's isn't fine dining and all, but hey, it's not suppose to be a fast food dump either.  I will not be coming back here!!! The waitress took half an hour to even talk to us after giving us our sticky menus.  As for the food, it was mediocre, can't really say it was horrible or really fresh and yummy.  I had the ribs there and they were so-so.  I guess the service was so frustrating, I don't think anything would of tasted delicious at this point.  After seeing other's horrible review of this place I decided to confirm that this place is definitely a dump.  If I want Friday's I guess I'll just go to the one in Woodland Hills or Porter Ranch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-simi-valley?start=160,1.64,1.64,1.64,1.924,1.6400000000000001

After running into some co-workers by the bar, one of the friends I was meeting called me from the big high-walled booth.  The waitress came over as I was sitting down, and I had an iced tea shortly after I ordered it.  She was good about keeping it full too. Good job waitress.        Before too long our other friends showed up, and our server kept up her good service and would stop by frequently. My friends ordered drinks and our waitress had them out fairly quickly.      The six of us chatted, caught up on where our lives were, and began to order Happy Hour half price appetizers. It was indeed Happy. They came out usually a few minutes after we ordered them, and they were all very tasty. Probably ridiculously unhealthy, but tasty nonetheless.       Over the period of the evening, we ordered the following appetizers to split amongst the six people; Loaded Potato Skins, Buffalo Wings, Crispy Green Bean Fries, and the Jack Daniels Sampler, which unfortunately was not half off, but still very good.                The beer flowed cold, the appetizers were delivered hot, and the company was grand.

Expect a wait on your food time ... as well as having to pretty much grab your waiter/waitress and drag them to your table. When it's busy ... forget it, be prepared to wait.

We decided to have a nice steak dinner on the patio and decided to go to Fridays.  What could go wrong?  First the patio is completely full of douchebags shouting and comparing tattoos.  It's very noisy - on a Sunday night no less.  Second the live entertainment was just annoying.  Third, TGI Fridays permits smoking on the patio, so forget about breathing fresh air while dining.  Fourth, both of our steaks were overcooked, thin and tough.  We could barely cut it - much less chew it.  Fifth, I ordered my steak rare and it arrived well done.  Sixth, my steak was supposed to be served with Alfredo sauce.  Instead it arrived with marinara sauce.  Note to the chef - Alfredo is white - marinara is red...  Seventh, the bill for this horrendous dining experience was a whopping $21 per plate!   The bottom line is, if you're a noisy drunken tool who likes smoking while eating, lots of noise, and has money to burn for thin, overcooked steaks with the wrong sauce - then TGI Fridays is definitely for you.  For the rest of us, there are places with much better food & service who charge half as much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-simi-valley?start=120,1.88,1.88,1.88,2.02,1.88

I don't usually patron TGIF's due to less than average experience but figured it was a good choice for a quick lunch.  We walked in and there was nobody there to greet us.  The podium was all by itself so we casually walked in to the bar area and seated ourselves.  Only then did we attract some attention and menus were brought to us. The waitress that took our drink and food orders was very nice and attentive.  She got our drinks promptly and notified us when to expect our food, which arrived some 15 minutes after ordering.  I had the Buffalo Chicken sandwich with fries.  While the chicken itself was okay, it was soaked in excessive buffalo wing sauce.  Way too much for my taste; it totally overpowered everything in the sandwich including the chicken.  The bread was also soaked with sauce.  I ate what I could after scraping most of the sauce off with my knife.  The fries that came with the sandwich were soggy.

The tables were dirty & sticky, and the service was so slow. I thought it was because it was crowded until I saw our server chatting it up in the back with other servers. Got tired of waiting and went elsewhere.  Next, went straight to the bar. Took forever to get noticed. I asked for a cocktail or happy hour menu and they couldnt' find one. Again, got tired of waiting as the bartender stood around talking, so we left. The service is awful. Spend your hard-earned money elsewhere.

191,June B.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,5,,2.0,2013-02-13,"Eating out for my husband and i nowadays is a treat we can rarely afford. It had been a long while since we visited this TGI's. Always used to have good food and good service. Things went wrong as soon as we walked in. They were not busy. We were greeted by a sour faced server who took us to a table. We politely asked if we could wait for a booth, and you would have thought we had asked for the moon. She stood there expecting us to sit at the table and ignored our request. We repeated it, and she stomped off while we waited. We should have walked out there and then. We finally got seated and waited & waited for our server. When she came she was pleasant and polite. This is the only reason i have given 2 stars & not 1!  We sat there a long while before we got any drinks. Then we waited & waited for our food. At one point when the server did appear again, i caught her eye and she rushed off to the kitchen. I don't know whether they were short staffed in the kitchen that day or were just slow, but i dread to think what would have happened if they were busy! When we finally got the food it was nice & hot, but such a small amount! Funnily enough, a friend of our server came in after us, and got his food super quick, & our server spent the rest of the time we were in there, talking to him! On a good note, we were sat in the right hand side booths. Over the left hand side is a huge, very long row boat, that was thick with dust. Not very hygienic sitting under that, eating!! I cannot tell you how disappointed we were. Our rare trip to eat out was ruined. We felt angry and frustrated & it ruined our day. We remembered this restaurant as a fun, good value place to eat a few years ago. Such a shame it's gone downhill so much. This is the first bad review i have ever given, i like to look for all the positive's in a place, but i'm struggling to find anything good about this place. Sorry!. Most of the reviews on this TGI's are 2 star. Perhaps corporate, or at least the manager should be reading these reviews, and start taking notice!

141,Billy D.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,38,,1.0,2013-03-04,"Only gave a (1) star because that's the lowest.  This place is absolutely HORRIBLE!  Management should be embarrassed.  I hope Corporate reads these so they shut this place down.  I travel a lot and I can say most TGIF's have gone way down hill over the years, but this one in Simi is disgusting. The service is pathetic and the food is not meant for human consumption.  They don't make anything fresh.  It's all prepared.  The lettuce is wilted and dirty, the chicken tenders are tiny and taste like rubber (most likely microwaved), the fries are way undercooked, the cheese sticks are thawed out and served at room temperature, the steak is like cardboard.  The service is basically non-existent.  You have to ask for things multiple times and you're lucky if you get place setting within five minutes after getting your meal.  Forget free refills because unless you're there for two hours you're not getting a refill.  The servers make you feel like you did something wrong when you order or when you ask for anything.  Obviously a sign of how unhappy they are with their management.   I don't go to this one much.  In fact, I don't go to any of them much.  But this one is empty every time I walk in.  It's kids eat free on Monday and at 7:30 the restaurant is at about 25% capacity.

Most of the appetizers are pretty tasty, my favorite being the pretzel bread sticks with melted beer cheese (don't judge, just try it). They also serve a nice vanilla bean cheesecake and super sweet strawberry shortcake that is sure to please any sweet tooth. Lastly, the service has always been great. The energetic, young wait staff are always helpful. It also doesn't hurt that this is one of the very few places open late (other than Denny's) in this whole dang town. The cons: The dinners they serve here just aren't worth what you pay. They are on the high end of moderately priced and there just isn't anything great about them. The dishes tend to either be way over seasoned or tasteless. I'm not sure why they bother other than the fact that all that booze streaming out of the bar shouldn't be consumed on an empty stomach. Plus, every time I've tried to order a steak here (which they tout as one of their specialties) it comes out consistently ill prepared. I feel sorry for the waiters because I've had to send them back so often. Most items, be it drinks or food are highly over priced but with the dinners I have to draw the line because they don't make it worth my while in flavor. Lastly, if you're not planning to get drunk the atmosphere Thur, Fri and Sat nights is obnoxious, so choose your timing wisely. Useful info: Typical of other locations in this chain, has private large lot, park away from main building at night to avoid drunk idiots, open until 1am but kitchen may close a bit earlier if business is slow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-simi-valley?start=120,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.476,2.44

For out last visit starting at 7 PM Friday night, went there for a B-Day dinner with a group of about 20. Now, to be fair, I would expect things to go a bit slower when your dealing with a larger party, but 3 hours start to finish? The waitress, who was very pleasant the whole evening, was woefully under trained or under experience to deal with a large party with split checks.  It took over 30 mins to straighten out the checks. There seemed to be no urgency in her actions to get things settled. Other then that, the food was decent, but staggered over 30 mins or so. Meaning people that ordered at the same time did not receive their meals at the same time. And the Long Island Iced Tea was the WORST I have ever had, was nasty. Something was out of sync with that drink! Had to send it back. Replaced it with the Fuzzy peach, iced tea, lemonade cooler. The name from the menu may be different, I don't recall the exact name of the drink, but it was mediocre at best. Tasted very watered down, very difficult to pick out any flavors in that one. I usually have 2 drinks with dinner, but not with that crap coming out of the bar that night.  And my previous visit several days earlier, for food only, had issues with the server. Quite surely, and slow to take care of the table. We arrived to the table and there was no silverware or napkins. No worries I think, as long as they come before food hits the table. Well that didn't happen. When the appetizers came, no napkins or silverware. We had to flag down the server and asked when we might get some, and her response was, ""don't worry, we wont make you eat your diner with your hands"". How about some napkins while we eat our finger foods? How about if someone din't want to use their hands to eat the greasy, buy good tasting appetizers? Server was lucky I was there, because the wife was not amused and would have stiffed her for a tip, thats how much she cared for the crummy service.  In the past I have had diner there and the food is usually decent. And you cant beat the 2 for $20 deal! It just seems the quality of staff is not up to par.

135,Bryce W.,"Simi Valley, CA",80,220,2.0,1.0,2014-09-22,"We recently spent the evening at Friday's for a fundraiser. This is something we do almost monthly at various establishments that are kind enough to offer to host. We generally draw a fantastic turnout. The latest one was no different. Unfortunately, the restaurant was unprepared. We sat in the bar area for the happy hour menu. My wife and I spend a lot of time volunteering, so we wanted to enjoy the evening with reasonably priced beers and appetizers accompanied by our close friends. We got there about 5:30 on a Tuesday with the bar area about half full. There was on server assigned to the bar. Apparently, the restaurant thought one server in the bar area was sufficient and, quickly, the bar was packed.  I'm just going to break down the night into different aspects of the experience rather than writing out the three hour experience. The service: Our first round of drinks came with light heady pours. It is what it is. A bad pour is based on the bartender, but it's always a little disappointing. We moved on. With one server in the bar area though, we had a lot of down time where he didn't come to see us. Multiple times we had to stop him to ask to order food or drinks and usually that was met with an impatient sigh if not downright rude comments. When new people joined us, he never came to take their order. When we ordered food, it took up to an hour to receive it. Our friends ordered the potato skins appetizer. It took an hour to come and when it did, the plate was hot to the touch from sitting under the heat lamp so long. Inconsistent pours, delays in both ordering and receiving what we wanted, and his surliness left a bad impression. By the end of the night, the manager had to personally bring us items we'd ordered because the server had either never put them in or forgotten to bring them out. He even had to clear our beer glasses after I had started stacking them in the center of the table to make room for food that never came. The Bill: After our first round the server asked if we were all on one bill, we replied no and told him who ordered what so he could start separate bills. While he wrote something down, he apparently never actually separated the bills. At the end of the night, we received one bill and he explained that with everyone ordering, he just couldn't keep track. Incompetence is not an excuse. We were all reasonable and would have given him the time necessary to track tabs or even split the bill ourselves at the end of the night if he had been upgront with us and said he couldn't manage splitting it with such a large group.  The end of the night, though, came long after we were ready to leave. It took an hour to get our bill. When we did get it, there were countless items that were wrong. I had to send back the bill three times because items we didn't order were on the bill and prices were wrong. The appetizers that took 45 minutes to come out?Oh, that was apparently because he forgot to put them in as evidenced by the non happy hour pricing. The process of actually paying the bill took so long we had to order another round of drinks for the wait. If it wasn't a fundraiser, this would have been the first time I ever left without paying a bill.  The manager: He was very nice, but by the time he tried to intervene, it was too late. He should have been bussing tables and bringing out food earlier. He should have called in a server who had the night off. He should have expected a better turnout from the beginning. He gave us free appetizer coupons and offered to increase staff if we returned, but why would we? It went beyond ""lack of staff"" to ""rude and incompetent staff"".  The product: Was fine when it came on time, but why order endless wings if he never asks if you want a refill and never brings them when you order them? Beer levels were wildly inconsistent. Sometimes the glass was full, sometimes the beer stopped two inches from the top. I can't really complain about the quality I guess. It was as expected. Overall, this was a really disappointing night. After three hours, I ended up donating $10 to our organization. Of course, I could have donated that directly and not had to deal with the irritation of our friends who were there to support our organization. Fridays performed so poorly that it reflected bad on our non profit. That's very disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-simi-valley?start=100,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.18,2.68
24,Rochelle M.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,14,,4.0,2014-10-07,"I've probably been here a couple hundred times by now, not including the brief 4 months that I worked here almost 10 years ago.  I think Renee said it best - ""I don't expect much and I'm never disappointed."" This is TGIF, not a fancy steak house.  I am usually only here for happy hour (though I'm sad they've recently raised their happy hours prices). I still think the half-price appetizers are awesome, and there's a lot of drinks in the $4-$6 range. I don't know if I'd pay full price for anything I've had, but it's a great deal on happy hour. I love the Spinach Florentine Flatbread and the pretzel with beer cheese. $1.50 sliders and basket of fries aren't a bad deal, either. Service is sometimes hit or miss, but I've yet to have anyone totally horrible. Sometimes it takes a while to get food/drinks, but that's because it's 10:30 on a Friday night and it's BUSY. Not the server's fault. Expect slower service on a busy weekend night. I've had a lot of really great servers. The manager seems to care, also. One time the manager approached our table and gave us coupons for free appetizers because we had to wait so long for our drinks..... we hadn't even complained! How nice  :)  Again, it's a chill place to enjoy decent food and drinks at a decent price.

Right it took her twenty minutes to come back and take our order when she finally did it took close to 35 minutes for her to bring it out now am not blaming her for the cook taking his time in making our food but she never even came by to see how we were doing. The one and only time she did she was walking by with someone else's order in her hand and didn't even stop at our table just kinda mumbled it as she walked by.  We both ordered the sizzling chicken and mashed potatoes which was delicious however the bad and slow service was the deal breaker. When it was time to leave and I finally caught her to ask her for the check it took her forever to bring it.

Did have a little bit of a wait for a waitress to stop by our table. started with drinks, ordered a bud light on draft. Was flat, when I told the waitress she said she would have the bar tender check and return with another. When she came back she brought a bottle, said the bar tender didn't think any thing was wrong with the draft. ( um ok I guess I was lying lol!l ) my girl ordered a pineapple sangria she enjoyed the drink very much.  Ordered our food skipped appetizers. I ordered Jack Daniels sirloin and ribs combo with fries veggies and a wedge salad. Was really disappointed on the salad was more like a sliver than a wedge and @ almost $5.00 for the salad I was pretty heated. The main course did not disappoint steak came med/rare just how I like it the ribs were fall of the bone veggies and fries good. My girl ordered Jack Daniels chicken and shrimp with sweet potato fries and mac n cheese. All was good, sweet potato fries were a little skimpy.  Did not have any desert all though the whisky cake looked off the chain.

We waited to have our drink order taken, then my ""Cherry Limeade Freeze"" wasn't frozen, and was so cloying sweet that I needed to majorly water it down in order to drink it.  I mentioned this to the server when I asked for the glass of water.  She actually shrugged and said, ""Yeah"".  What?!  Not, ""I'm so sorry, would you care for something else?"" There went two stars right there. Sheesh.  We ordered from the 2 for $20 menu.  We all dug into the mozzarella marinara appetizer.  Adored Grandson and I shared the Bruschetta Chicken, which was savory and had great texture. Unfortunately, our entrees took a long time to come out, which meant the dish wasn't very warm, and the chicken was on the chewy side, not that tender. Dear Hubby ordered the Jack Daniels chicken meal, which came with two sides.  The spinach looked like it had dried out and died on the plate, sadly. I truly feel our server's inability to keep our meal moving, and also inability to check in at appropriate times to let us know where we were in the process had a large part in downgrading our experience.  I didn't feel that she was rude, just clueless about how to properly serve guests. We did try their strawberry shortcake dessert.  Meh.  It was a sundae, not a shortcake.  There was one small slice of what looked like Pepperidge Farms butter cake stuck into a pile of ice cream, with a few pitiful strawberries buried under the ice cream.  The conception of that dish needs to be revisited.  It was the least appetizing strawberry shortcake I've ever had, ever.

69,Food C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,103,,2.0,2016-10-17,"So, I have been going to Friday's for years.  I know what I'm getting.  But this might be my last venture.  I was coaxed into meeting some friends for Sunday morning football and there were a few bright spots. The good:   TV's are labeled when you walk in as what games will be on them and you can sit accordingly.  I think that's a great idea and it worked out very well for my friend and I who wanted to watch different games.   They have bottomless mimosas for 10 bucks! The bartenders were awesome and the service was quick and friendly.  I rarely had to ask for a refill and if I did, it was done immediately.  Kudos to the staff on a busy day. The bad: It's Friday's so I know going in that the food is going to be awful.  And since I wasn't expecting anything to be very good, I wasn't disappointed.  But things like bacon looking like the crap you see at the cheapest buffets in Vegas?  C'mon.  Show just a little culinary pride, Friday's.  As usual, everything was over-salted and greasy so just expect it to be bad and you won't be let down. The bottomless mimosas are great but you can't tweak it to your liking.  They make it 60-40 OJ to champagne.  For me, that's WAY too much OJ.  And they will not budge on this.  I get that it keeps you from drinking too much but I find that to be a really crappy practice.  You'll let me modify ANYTHING else but this?  I'll be passing on it in the future. All in all, if you like to watch all the games, this is a great place to go.  If you're looking for good food, this isn't it.  If you like morning mimosas with mostly OJ setting off your acid reflux, this will work out well for you.  For me, I'm done and won't be back...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-simi-valley?start=40,2.52,2.44,2.44,2.216,2.472

74,Katie M.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,3,,4.0,2017-01-12,"I come to Fridays mostly when I'm just looking for a casual gathering place with a few friends. I always enjoy the food, and their Georgia Peach cocktail is the only alcoholic beverage (at any establishment) that I order for the taste. Mostly low-key, friendly staff. They're not always the most diligent, but they're not overbearing, which is mostly what I care about.  My one bad experience happened the last time i was there, and I admit, i havent been back since, for fear a repeat. Our waitress only ever stopped by our table if she happened to be passing by on her way somewhere else. We felt rushed when ordering, and any questions were usually met with unnecessarily snippy answers. A different waitress delivered our food, and was the only one to notice that we had not yet received any tableware. Our waitress only fully reappeared when she delivered our bill, on which I noticed she had charged me for 2 drinks, one of which I ordered ($8), and the other was a similar, but more expensive drink ($9.50). We waited a long time to be able to flag her back around just so I could ask her to remove the extra charge, and when she finally got the new bill to us, she had removed the drink I actually recieved, and kept the charge for the more expensive one. I didn't want to spend even more time to get the extra $1.50, so we just put cash in the little book and waited for the final reciept and change, which the waitress never brought back. Finally, after our meal was done for quite some time now, and we had obviously just been waiting here, she stopped by just to let us know that her shift was over and she was leaving. I asked her then for the payment reciept, which she tried to tell me she'd already given us, which we all new was BS, because we were never given our change, either. So, as far as I can tell, this girl just assumed that whatever was left over from our cash payment was hers to keep, and never even bothered to bring the reciept, which, frankly, I find just rude and presumptuous. I almost wish now that I had just let her keep the change, rather than leaving her an actual (bigger) tip.  That's my rant. Over all, Fridays is great if you don't want a particularly fancy meal out. Good food, good drinks, and (mostly) good people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-simi-valley?start=40,2.36,2.47,2.47,2.288,2.426
83,Michael F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,,1.0,2017-01-21,"..........and this is proof they don't give a flying Fuss about customer service: Not one Manager, General Manager, Regional Manager, or anyone associated with this the business has enough interest in the business they work for to respond to a legitimate complaint. Gee whizikers.  Thank you Jason S. for responding. I accept any sincere apology, but as someone in management myself, I think apologies are of little value without going the 'extra mile' and doing something proactive in resolving the issue. Is this an actual law? If not, was the waitress misinformed or trained incorrectly? Was anything done as far as communicating to staff that this was a proper or improper way to treat customers? Perhaps this waitress had a horrible day? Should I try your business again with the assuredness that this will not happen again?  Michael Jason S.  The service at the restaurant is poor (look at the Yelp ratings). The service you give in response is even worse. It is YOUR job or someone else that works for the company to do what you suggested I do. The customer was already 'put-out' by Bad service. It is not for me to spend even more time speaking with the manager AND Customer Relations. Let me speak frankly to you. The very essence of customer service is to do the opposite of what is natural to us; be lazy. It would not Be lazy if it were you who took the next Step and spoke to the Manager or the DM or GM and ask them what the law is. Ask them what you can do to help this restaurant's Yelp rating. Ask them what You can do to satisfy a customer. Or, figure it out for yourself. But, never ask a customer to do the work for you. Remember. The essence of customer service is to not be lazy. You are working for me, I am not working for you. If one doesn't like their job, that is when they become lazy, that is when they ask inappropriate people to do a job that is not their task.

1,Eric S.,"Simi Valley, CA",7,59,1.0,1.0,2017-09-06,"Unconscionably bad wait staff service, and inedible food.   In our recent visit, the waitress never once came over for fifteen full minutes at which time we had to go find the hostess to eek out some service. When she did finally arrive, it took us awhile to realize she wasn't being rude because she was drunk, which it seemed, but because she was Russian or Latvian and barely spoke English. The burger had some kind of awful fake cheese sauce which tasted like vomit. This place needs to be bulldozed.  Don't eat here.  (Or any Friday's.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-simi-valley,2.12,2.36,2.36,,2.2640000000000002

48,Laura Marie D.,"Simi Valley, CA",182,17,1.0,1.0,2017-12-01,The worst experience  ever at this restaurant this evening . It started off with not being seated for nearly 40 minutes after our reservation time. At which point when we finally did get seated we waited nearly another 20 minutes to have our food order taken when are original waitress went on break a another waiter took over I accidentally spilled a tray of drinks on my friend. Which would have been overlooked if the service was good he apologized and handled it in a professional manner however when the original Raiders came back on she verbally insulted him in conversation with a couple of people at our table which I thought was very unprofessional of her. The manager never came to the table to the very end of the stay when I told him they did not tend to our table in a proper manner nobody cleared off the old drink cups or the dishes when we were done he apologized but never sent anyone over to clear the table so basically we sat there with all of our dirty dishes and extra drink cups throughout the whole time normally we can Overlook these sort of things if the restaurant is super busy but it wasn't the service at this restaurant is horrible this isn't the first time this sort of thing happens you need to really tighten up on your crew and teach them the ins and out of being a server. you clear the table as often as needed. But just so you know the food was amazing my compliments to the chefs. we will not be coming back though,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-simi-valley?start=20,2.08,2.29,2.29,,2.2060000000000004

However, it worked good for us because we went to Chili's and had excellent service and an excellent meal and I got to spoil my server with a big fat tip for this Holiday Season.
