282,Pepe S.,"South Gate, CA",0,7,9.0,2.0,2014-09-01,"Ok, I understand that this place just opened so I'll excuse the 45 minute wait to be seated. What I can't have patience for is a one hour wait to receive our food. That's not all, anytime I would ask for a refill or more appetizers and even napkins, it would take them at least 20 minutes for them to either come back with what I asked or to ask me to confirm what it is I asked for initially. This meant an extra 5-10 minute wait.  Summary: super slow service. I was in the restaurant for almost 3 hours of which 2 1/2 hours was spent waiting. I will come again in one month or so to post an updated review, since I understand it was a new restaurant, waiters were new, and it was very busy. It was a bit pricey, but agreeable overall. Hopefully my next visit will change my review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-south-gate?start=300,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088
287,Jasmine P.,"Phoenix, AZ",31,34,28.0,5.0,2014-09-02,I think this is the best Fridays I've been to. The staff if so friendly and attentive. My waitress was very enthusiastic and was probably the best waitress I have ever had. The food was amazing and the decor and designs at this Fridays is awesome!! I will definitely come here any time I want to go to Fridays!

268,Paula E.,"South Gate, CA",9,1,1.0,1.0,2014-09-14,"I made a yelp account specifically for this review. I came for my first time ever Saturday (technically Sunday)at around 12:40am, by 1:00a.m. me and my friends had ordered our food and drinks we then moved from the bar to one of the surrounding tables. When the bleached-blonde, tattoo covered bartender came to our table asking us is we wanted to close out our bill. I didn't want to but she said that it was something they needed to do since we switched from the bar to the diner. So we told her that it was going to be two separate bills and that if we could get it split.  She said no problem and ,this is where we messed up, we gave her our cards without ever seeing the bill. A little less than 25 minutes later and we are all ready to leave, and that's when I remember we never got our cards back. So we try to get the attention of the bar tender but that didn't work so I get up to go ask for our debit cards back. To which she replies that she transferred our bill to a server named Nelly , someone we never saw and says she will tell her we are ready to leave. We continue to wait and at this point it had already been 15 minutes since we had told the blonde bartender about our dilemma. It's then that we decide to go up and ask someone to see what the hell was going on. We go up by the host stand and wait for someone to come by ,so by the time the manager came out we were frustrated and just asked where our cards were. The manager was confused so we tell her our story and finds it a little weird so she goes to the back to figure out what had happened. When she comes out she ends up telling us that the server (again somebody we never saw) lost one of the cards. I was in disbelief when I heard this.  I have heard about shitty service before but never had I heard about someone losing their debit/credit card because their anonymous server had lost track of it. This is the worst experience ever! The blonde bartender,had a bossy attitude and just kept rushing us. I didn't like her but she got our orders pretty fast, so I didn't mind. The atmosphere there is really nice! I was once again surprised to see such a nice place in South Gate. Not only that but Marty the bartender was awesome. He greeted us personally and poured my drink in a nice mason jar. He also did really great tricks, I really liked him. As much as I was enjoying myself, I will never come back. FYI: There are at least 10 reviews with 2 stars or less that have been filtered under ""not recommended"" Check them out because this is not a well ran establishment you will be severely disappointed if you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-south-gate?start=260,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02

I recently found or that this location is a franchise so they are not run by TGIF's but by an independent owner who makes up his/her own rules. The sign on the door said $12 bucket of Coronas and they didn't honor it cuz they said it's after 10pm when the sign clearly doesn't state that. Anyway, the service is slow and many employees are learning on the job. You need patience for sure. And I heard all the negative Yelps have been hidden. We actually left cuz it took an hour to get our appetizers and dinner :( P.S. They hired some shitty servers that I've seen at other restaurants near by so no hope for improvement anytime soon.

I must say this experience was a HUGE difference. The host (a redheaded gal) got me a table within minutes of arriving. About a minute later my server, Brenda, came by with a smile on her face and a friendly personality. She told me they had happy hour all day because of football Monday. She explained the happy hour menu to me and answered all my questions. I ordered a Newcastle and a few appetizers. Brenda brought me a water while I waited for my beer. About a minute later she came with my Newcastle. She brought out all my appetizers and made sure I was satisfied with everything. She brought me a water before I could even finish it and made sure I always had a glass of beer on my table to sit back and enjoy the game.  Overall I am beyond satisfied with this experience. Food was great, drinks were always full, and plenty of tvs around the bar.

Wait was about 1 hour, I didn't think it be that long of a wait considering all of the tables that were open and so I was right, Cesar assisted us right away and showed us to our table, he was very warming and attentive. Next came our waitress Brianna, she was amazing, on top of her game, made me think she was a manager of some sort and if she is not,  she should be. I was able to tell the difference in service from other tables and boy was I glad to have her. Food came out quick and she checked on us pretty frequently. I hope to see both Cesar and Brianna soon.

Didn't know the difference from a French onion soup and a clam chowder. She never brought us silverware or plates for apps. Our table remained unbussed for pretty much the duration of our visit. I would understand if it were busy and she had no time but it wasn't. She was a very sweet girl very nice but sweet doesn't keep customers coming back. the trainers nor validator did their job correctly.

258,Mariana G.,"Downey, CA",3,19,1.0,5.0,2014-11-23,"Before I planned coming here I decided to check the reviews on this place and I was really surprised to see most of them were all talking so negative about this place which made me think about it twice if it was a good idea to bring my family to such a bad place and on top of that on such a special occasion which was my grandmothers birthday. I have always been a fan of FRIDAYS and in my family it has always been our to go place for birthdays so i was really excited to have one so close to me. I did not  want to fill my head with ideas without even trying it. So i thought lets wish for the best and enjoy being with the family and the convenience of it being really close.  So entering one of the girls working opened the door for us and greeted us very nicely the host greeted us also and gave us the table that was closer so my grandmother would not walk so much which was also something very nice. Our waitress came over introduced herself and was very fast with our drinks and we asked for a three for all and as soon as we said we were ready to order our food, she took the order she helped us out and another girl came over to give us our three for all with the plates.  OMG! I thought that was fast, from all the Fridays ive ever been to we pretty much have always had to wait a while for our three for all to be served and would always have to remind them about the small plates.  And as soon as we were done with the Three for all maybe not even 5 min went by when our waitress came over cleaned and took everything out of the way to make room for our food. Wow that was fast! Much faster than any Fridays before and it was 4 of us so it was great service our waitress was always asking if we needed refills at the right time, she would check on us and I think the best best part was when the waitress came over and she was cleaning up and my sister asked my grandmother ""How are you enjoying your birthday today grandma?"". Well at the end of our meal everybody (friday waitresses) came over and sang the happy birthday song and gave her an ice cream sundae. Apparently the waitress heard what my sister said and brought her the sundae and made everybody sing. It was wonderful and everybody had a great time we went outside and we were going to take a picture and one of the friday host came out and helped us take a picture of us all together. So I give this place 5 stars if they keep up the great work this place will get a lot of people that love fridays and will be willing to travel from wherever they are to come to this one because I can say I have been to all of the fridays in LA and honestly this one has the fastest and friendliest service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-south-gate?start=240,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.2920000000000003,3.1200000000000006

240,Joel K.,"Buena Park, CA",59,21,,1.0,2014-12-22,"wow....all I have to say about this place is, I feel very bad for the owners and the tgif corporation for spending so much money building such a beautiful restaurant, only to have it ruined by incompetent and disgruntled staff. As an owner of a business myself, I would be bald from pulling my hair if I knew my restaurant was being run like this. From the manager Leo down to the our plus sized waitress with the glasses who cursed at us in spanish under her breath, this place is an absolute abomination to the definition of a full service restaurant.  Even getting reservations at this place was an entirely unique experience, where the female host forgot that she put me on hold twice and the male host was rude in every possible way. He said to call back an hour and a half before the reservation to make sure we would get our seats. Um...isn't that what a reservation is for? Then when we called that day someone else tells us they don't DO reservations but would make an exception for us.....umm, comprendes?  Our office still decided to do our christmas party here because I believed that maybe just the host was incompetent and the restaurant, like i said, was beautiful.  Now granted, it was the friday before christmas and tgi was extremely busy that night from other company parties, but that was no excuse to how we were treated. Of course that night our reservation was NOT honored, and we had to wait to be seated.  When we finally got seated in the patio our waitress refused to give us menus, because they weren't sure if those seats were reserved for someone else.....umm I thought you guys didn't DO reservations? The manager Leo came out to smooth over the situation and he was a nice guy, but much too timid and passive to be able to control his staff. He tried to serve us but the waitress was already disgruntled, and cursed at us under her breath.  Now an hour into our christmas dinner attempt, we didn't want to find some unpleasantries in our food (such as saliva), and decided to take our business elsewhere.  My only hope is that the owners of this location read this review and take a closer look at how this restaurant is managed.

He thought it was delicious but he thinks it would be better if they put the Jack Daniels sauce in the burger instead of a dipping sauce.

Since the unveiling of this one which happens to be in my hometown, I figured, ehh...why not!  I recently tried this place with a coworker during the late evening hours. We had just managed to make it in time for happy hour at the bar area! Score! Beers it was for us both! Cheaply priced beers during this time. Appetizers are half priced during HH! As for the appetizers, I have tried their potato skins, mozzarella cheese sticks, bbq flatbread pizza and their famous basket of fries. My experience the few times I have came have been great, except for this one visit where a coworker of mine only got 1 refill the whole 2 hours we was there. I thought it was the waitress' job to ask us and scan the table to see if we were okay! But anyway...the way this place was designed inside was quite nice but nothing out of the ordinary compared to other franchises I have visited.  Located in the brand new Azalea shopping center that just got unveiled last year, parking is plenty and abundant. Beware during sporting events as it can be quite full and with also quite a long wait. My favorite dish from here is the Sizzling Chicken and Shrimp which comes in a sizzling skillet! This plate is a must try! Personally this is one of my favorite restaurant franchises to go eat at. I am very glad that they finally have one here in my hood. Except for that one incident, service has always been punctual and great. I believe this location will thrive and do just great, just like others have.

First we order our drinks and then our food. We were a little over half way done with our food before we even received our drinks. Our server said it was because the bar was ""backed up"" but there were no bartenders in the bar so I see why. My friend gets her nachos and they are half way put together. Little to no sauce and barely anything on them. We had to return our food a total of 7 times between the two of us.  Our server was okay but his comprehension could have been used a little more efficiently. He lacked communication skills and proper restaurant etiquette. By far the worst experience I've ever had at any TGI Fridays ever. I will never ever ever EVER EVER come back to this location. Terrible terrible terrible customer service.

We were greeted at the door by three hostesses between the ages 11-14 it looked like.   Obviously, whoever is doing the hiring has some pedophile tendencies. Surprisingly, we were seated promptly, the place was almost empty.  Still it took the waitress almost 20 minutes to show up and take our drink order.  We ordered our food and waited and waited and waited and then waited some more. Finally, she shows up with one dish in her hand. The other two dishes showed up about 12 minutes later.   The food looked second rate at best.  Everything looked wilted and poorly cooked. The steaks were rough and easily recognizable as a low quality product. Just in one dish a rice dish of all things, there were 5 pieces of garlic! Inedible, to say the least. The whole dish was ruined.  The cook must have been hired from the local Home Depot parking lot. Our dishes came with side options which we were never informed of. So we had to eat what she decided we should have as sides. Needless to say the service was just as bad as the food. The girl needed a nap or something because she was rude and arrogant.  Pay attention to the reviews of this place, that says it all. HORRIBLE FOOD AND SERVICE!! Don't waste your time and money here. You're better off going to CHILI'S over at Downey Landing.

This was like our third time eating at a TGIF so we were are fairly new here. I ordered our food for me, my wife, brother and sister in law from the happy hour menu that was placed on our table. So we get our food and enjoyed it but when we got our check we noticed we were not getting the happy hour price. Waitress called over the manager and the manager's explanation was that we should have read the menu carefully or asked questions to the waitress and we would have realized that happy hour that night was only in the bar area. I explained to him that we didn't know and if I was pointing out items from the happy hour menu then the waitress should've told me that it was not happy hour prices in the dining area. The manager kept insisting that it is not the waitress job to let us know,that we should've asked or read the menu carefully. The last thing I said was if it is not their job to let us know these things then why do they work here. Manager said their job was to just write down orders. I told him that next time if I decide to come here then I might as well should just place my own orders and maybe even cook them myself. The manager said I could clean the dishes also when I'm done!! Wow, what great customer service. In the end he adjusted the price but I was shocked at how he was trying to put the blame on me. Why have waitress and hostess if they are not going to do their job and then still try to blame the customer as if we are the ones who work there.

329,Ivonne R.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,3,1.0,1.0,2015-05-02,"I actually wish there was a lower rating than one star.  It was my first time at a TGI FRIDAYS, and it was the worst experience in my life from the waitresses to the manager. They took way too long to bring us our drinks, appetizers, and main course the food wasnt too good either, the burger was way salty just like the fries.  It was my sisters birthday and no one acknowledged that, she was wearing a crown and a sash, youd literally had to be blind not to see it was her birthday. I actually felt like the waitresses had personal problems with us. Regardless, when we were done and wanted our check not one person helped us. And at first we signaled to get help, then I signaled any passing waitress and they all ignored me, until I was fed up I had to raise my voice because maybe they didn't hear me. It got to the point where I had to get up from my seat and look for a manager I told him that nobody was helping us and that we just wanted the check. We got our check and the manager didn't bother to apologize for such a poor service. I mean if your company's motto is that you don't care about providing at the very least a good customer service then you're a great job communicating it. This service was to say the least, an insult we had such a terrible time that it would take a lot for me to try another location even. This visit inspires me to blacklist Fridays to everyone I know, I'm so outraged that I'm even writing this complaint, and that's not all I'm so mad I'm going on yelp Facebook any social media to make sure and let other people know what insulting service is offered at this particular location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-south-gate?start=320,1.8,2.29,2.29,2.052,2.0940000000000003

There was nowhere to sit at the bar and you still have to wait to be seated in the tables surrounding the bar. I could understand why the bar would be crowded on a Friday night but there were plenty of open tables around the bar that were not being used and most patrons were being seating in the restaurant anyways. We had been told a 15-20 min wait. Fine with that but the hostess didn't call us, in fact, she skipped over us and after we saw that more than a few people got a table before us that had arrived after us we inquired with the waitress who then said she called us. No she didnt, we were standing 5 ft away from her and she never called us. We told her this to which she replied that she would seat us next. No apology.  Then we got seated in the area around the bar. Really?  Pfft. I could have gotten my own drinks from the bar and taken it over to the table. There seems to be bad planning and horrible communication at this place. Atleast, I had some entertainment as I watched another table argue with the manager about the service and the bill.

I've experience both. Sometimes you'll walk right in and get seated right away and other times you'll wait a good 20-30 minutes. Sitting at the bar is good, when you can find an empty spot.

I prefer to sit outside, there's a flat screen and it's way less raunchy and loud than the inside. There's usually a wait to sit outside but nothing crazy, we came with a party of 4 on a Saturday night & the wait was 10 minutes. The buffalo boneless wings are very very good, and the $1.50 basket of happy hour fries are unbeatable when served hot. The $1.50 happy hour hamburger sliders are super cute and pretty good. The $6 happy hour drinks are very strong in my taste, the ultimate Long Island iced tea was way strong compared to say, lazy dog café Long Island iced tea, but if you're looking for a buzz this will get you going. The (I forget the name) with Malibu, sour powder, Sprite, kiwi, and pineapple juice is quite small for $7.50, so because of that I probably wouldn't order again. The service is decent, but there are clusters of employees everywhere talking, laughing, and swearing up a storm, loudly.

I went in last Friday and stood at the front while some girl chatted on the phone and a host and hostess completely ignored me and everyone else who was waiting. A couple other people came in after me and had to bug the male host to get some attention and ask how long the wait was. I seemed to annoy the host when I asked if he could seat is and he told us we would just have to wait like everyone else. I had to ask him how long the wait was and if there was a list. There were about four people at the desk who didn't greet anyone or seem to want to seat anyone. I understand Friday's are busy at tgi Fridays but it seems you have to beg to pay for dinner.

62,Jennifer F.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,14,15.0,2.0,2016-01-17,"Been here numerous times and was always happy, until today! My husband and I liked to come here on weekends, the food and drinks are reasonable specially when it's Happy hour you can't go unhappy.  Usually we sit right away at the bar but today our son joined us so we had to wait for a table. The hostess informed me that it would be a 45 min wait which was ok until I saw numerous tables empty & not cleaned. That is when I asked for the manager to see what was the hold up. Immediately the manager apologized and was able to seat us within 5 min after I spoke with him.  Our waitress, Nancy, was nice. Our first round of drinks came within 5 min of ordering as well as our appetizers within 10 min. One of the appetizers was The Jack Daniels Sliders, which we've had, was missing the caramelized grilled onions so I brought it to our waitress attention who apologized and offered a new order of the same, free of charge, served correctly. We waited for about 30 minutes for another manager to tell us they ran out of grilled onions. This was my husbands appetizer so they offered the same but without onions, he said that was ok. That excuse was absurd because who runs out of onions at this type of restaurant?? Lastly, I didn't use the restroom but my friend did and she has one word for it: DISGUSTING! She said the 3 stalls were filthy with feces and paper all around on the seats and floor. All in all, I'm disappointed this time around. My friends will definitely not join us here if there's even a next time. Clearly management has changed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-south-gate?start=80,2.04,2.08,2.08,1.576,2.064

Plenty of loud Dodgers fans yelling when the closer & Yasiel Puig blew Clayton Kershaw's lead. Honestly, Puig could have caught, so I was yelling too. SERVICE  Nice. Fast, well, mostly. I was taken aback by how sticky and dirty the menus and high chairs for our toddlers were.  THE GRUB - Disappointing... - Absolut Pear Mojito - pass on this! It had a little kick, but it was so packed with ice that it watered down fast.  Oh, and it was $10.29. Whaaaaa? - Potato skins ($5) - they just don't seem like they used to be - Fried mozzarella sticks ($4.50) - these are always a hit with my family - Bourbon Barrel Mahi Mahi with jasmine rice and fresh tomato mozzarella salad ($19.29) - while the Mahi Mahi was totally edible and cooked okay, it was lackluster. It was just disappointing. The jasmine rice was, of course, a good combination. If you like a little red onion, then you should fill up nicely with that salad.  - Aside from all that they could work on their presentation of the plates a little bit better PARKING Free.

The hostess area is overcrowded with the girls loudly talking about personal things (I'm all down for girl talk but can you please shut up and write down my name for a party of 5??)  2.

130,Leidy G.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,19,7.0,1.0,2016-11-28,"Went to this TGIF on Saturday night. Called the location at 11:30pm before even deciding to go and ask the lady that answered the phone at what time they closed to verify. She told me they closed at 2am but the kitchen would stop making food at 1:30am. Got to the restaurant with my party around 12:15am & our waitress was Hoana. As soon as we sat down she was there rushing us to order, we hadn't even fully looked at the menus and I felt like I had to make any choice I saw because of how pushy she was. It was almost 12:30 and she told us we all had to put in our complete orders because the kitchen would be closing at 12:45. I told her what I just called and the lady I spoke to told me that you guys close at 2 & that the last order of food is at 1:30 AM. She said ummm , well yeah but we're going to close it at 12:45. So I told her then why when I called the lady told me it's 1:30 that's the reason we decided to be here &  come here with time. She said she was ready to go home. How ridiculous. The whole time she was the status is seem like we were bothering her like if she didn't want to help us out. Really bad service and to top it off the food was not good. I think they purposely cut our steaks smaller and the macaroni wasn't good.  Also my husband ordered grilled shrimp and they had a lot of like black juice over them. When we asked about it she said oh it's because it's grilled. He's definitely had grilled shrimp before and it's never black from the grill that means they didn't clean the grill and just gave us those like shrimp so we asked her if she can please exchange them for fried shrimp and said she replied trying to give an excuse that the shrimp are fine but then just knoded her head and took the shrimp & exchanged them. First time at TGI Friday's & the last time, the worst service ever. I hope they get better employees who actually care their job & the company they work for instead of rushing customers because they want to go home earlier than scheduled time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-south-gate?start=160,2.12,1.99,1.99,1.7320000000000002,2.0420000000000003

On to the food:  they have this endless appetizer promotion right now for $10 per person.  We also got lucky and made it to happy hours which ended at 7pm.  So we ordered sliders ($1.50 each), basket of fries ($1.5), Long Island ($6.25), and ultimate lemonade ($6.25).  The endless appetizers you get choices of:  fried green beans (I really like this dish - not too oily and crispy but just the right amount), flatbread pizza (can't go wrong w this dish), mozzarella sticks (really good but heavy), and boneless wings (BBQ, jack daniel sauce, buffalo sauce)  the sauce itself is perfect but the chicken is insanely tough...I didn't like this one at all, incredibly hard to eat.  But what really surprised me was how little of it I can actually eat lol.  I seriously came with the intention of taking them to the poor house and after second plate, I was in a deep food coma.  Everything is so heavy there's just no way for me to eat more :(  but still incredibly worth it for the price.  Another thing we noticed which was really really weird is that the Long Island during happy hours is much stronger then Long Island normal price and much less sour as well.  So I guess load up during happy hours!!! Overall, we did notice the slow service towards the end of our stay especially since our waitress went home but we were there for almost 5 hours lol so we didn't care at all.  But our waitress was awesome and she made our experience that much better!!  What was truly amazing was when it was time to pay the bill, she was able to split our bills to per couple (we had 12 people all together)!!  I'd come back again for the ambient and the endless apps lol especially for happy hours! On a side note:  they do offer tablets at your table so you can view the menu (I thought it was weird that you can't order food or drinks on the tablet...isn't this why you have it in the first place???)  and also you can request service on the tablet but it doesn't work.  We pressed it and it just kept blinking without anyone ever stopping by.  Just for fun we left it blinking under our table Har har har :P  oh and for $1.99 you can play games on it lol (for everyone who haven't converted to smart phones yet)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-south-gate,2.32,2.04,2.204,1.9000000000000001,2.152

We asked for to go plates and cups so that we could leave. The waiter brought us the to go cups and never stated that we could not take our drinks home. As we exited this establishment we was approached by a manager named Noami, very rudely she shouted ""YOU GUYS CAN NOT TAKE LIQUOR OUT OF HERE!"" She walked up on the driver side where I was standing and stated it again in a rude voice like she was irritated. I professionally tried to let her know that I would like a refund because I was not able to finish my drink after giving her my cup. She then stated in an even more hostile voice that I could either finish the drink inside or let her throw the drink away. I then let her know I did not like her tone and that she should have better customer service when dealing with a PAYING CUSTOMER! She then bangs on the trunk of my car and states "" YOU WILL NOT GET A REFUND, YOU CAN EITHER DRINK THIS INSIDE OR LET ME THROW IT AWAY! At this point I get angry and I start walking back inside to ask to speak to another manager or supervisor. While talking to security I over heard her tell him that I am lucky she didn't beat my ass. As I walked inside the establishment the girls at the counter told me she was the only manager in the facility at that time and I nicely asked them to give me the number to corporate as I would be calling in the morning to regulate this situation. Noami walks back and yells in my face "" THE NUMBER IS 1(800). . . I stopped her and told her she no longer had the right to speak to me as she was very rude and I over heard her threaten me while talking to security. She then states again yelling at me and causing a scene ""THE NUMBER IS 1(800). . . I told her again she has no right to talk to me and I would call the police on her if she did again. She then walks away and we exit the building. The next morning we called to speak to a different manager. Someone hung up in my face 3 times after I asked to speak to a manager (I believe they knew it was me calling). A male manager answers the phone as we told him what happened he told us that we were not able to take the liquor out of the establishment. We let him know that we understood that clearly! What we didn't understand is how they let their employee speak to us in that manner after we spent over $100 in this establishment! He tried to justify her wrong doing and even got an attitude with us. We ended up having to send an email to corporate which didn't help at all so now I'm just trying to let everyone know that this establishment SELLS COLD FOOD AND HAS HOORIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY AND NOT GIVE A DAMN ABOUT HOW THEIr WORKERS TREAT YOU.

How can you make beef taste like nothing?! The fries at McDonald's taste better that the fries that were served to us.  We wanted them to do that birthday cake and singing thing for my mom just to salvage whatever was left of the night but after waiting for 20 minutes of awkwardly waiting we decided to just pay for the bill on the tablet and leave. They charged us for the birthday cake and a game that we supposedly bought on the tablet. What? We didn't even touch it only to pay. I spent over a hundred dollars for garbage food and garbage customer service.  I basically threw $100 in the toilet.

To begin, I stroll in at about 12:45 expecting the place to still serve food but immediately the bartender tells me that the kitchen is closing. So I ask him what time, which then he replys ""Now."" I felt hurried so I didn't even look at the menu and said buffalo wings. He then retraces his words and tells me I can take my time looking at the menu. I the say ""well you make it sound like I don't have time to order food."" Then, according to him, all of a sudden the kitchen has time to take my order so I can look at the menu. If this were truly the case, you wouldn't have said anything. The fact that he tried to retrace his steps after basically telling me to hurry the f up tells me the kitchen isn't supposed to be closed. From what I observed he looked more concerned with closing the bar. Anyways, then... Maybe I'm paranoid from reading the posts but I ordered boneless buffalo chicken wings (seriously how can anyone get this wrong, right?... no...) and they looked a bit suspicious. Of course I could not taste anything funky cause of the strong buffalo sauce (which I didn't mind) but the crispy breading on the chicken looked almost greenish (definitely discolored) in some places. Again, it maybe a mental thing from reading all the posts.. we shall found out. Anyways, I was willing to let it go of the food but then when I got my bill I was charged for a large beer when I clearly asked for a pint, which is a small. I can't tell the difference between the glasses because I don't measure liquids for a living but he poured and charged me for the large. I pointed this out to him after receiving the bill, which then he apologized and offered to redo the bill and charge the pint. I told him to leave as it is but he should do a better job of listening. I left a large portion of the beer untouched. Whether this was done intentionally or not, it definitely rubbed me the wrong way.

The wait was not a problem we were seated in less than 30mins. While we waited my Man went to the bar to order a drink .  Fast forwarding we were seated. We waited  and waited for the Waitress to come take our drinks and let us know she is serving us. We waited so long we asked another server if they knew who was our waiter. Finally she came Gisselle.   My Man ordered another drink, which came in a different size glass but was the same drink.  So he asked why was one drink in a different size glass when the first one was in a smaller glass with less drink. We also pour the second drink into the short empty glass in front of Giselle. She also admitted it was spilling over with more liquor . She then stated she would talk to her manager to see what can be done. Giselle came back and stated she would take one drink off . Ok so that's what we thought would happen . Then we placed our orders to wait and waited and waited ..mind you we have two younger children. Finally food comes , we eat  and now its time for the check. The drink was never removed because apparently alcoholic beverages cant be removed from the check so the manager took $2.00 off our bill . The drink was $ 8.00 . It was not about the price it was the agreement made to remove it. So we requested to see a manger . We waited at least 10 to 15 minutes  for rude ass Naomi to show up. When she showed up she was rude . We explain the drink situation which she had two glasses on hand  to do another drink demo about a tall and wide glass like we are stupid.  I felt angry and annoyed . We said we already did that in front of the waitress and she agreed it was more . So for Naomi to come with glasses that contain no ice  and still  try to convince us of why we cant get $ 8.00 dollars back  at the end of the night was out of line and  was just not how I planned to be treated .  Naomi  STATED they are not allowed to remove alcoholic  drinks so she gave us a $ 2.00  discount .  Well that was not what the waitress told us upon seating down and addressing the drink issue . Also  When I told her about how long we waited for her, she snapped back with rude comments . In total we spent $ 56.25 plus a tip. The last thing We were trying to do was get a free meal.  I was just trying to skip cooking and go enjoy a nice family dinner. That didn't happen and I will NEVER COME BACK TO THIS LOCATION !!!!!!  WE  THEN HAD TO WAIT  ANDDDDDDD WAIT ANDDDD WAIT TO CHECK OUT . I finally got up and payed at the front .  I STILL FELT THE RIGHT THING TO DO WAS TIP THE WAITRESS EVEN THOUGH MY FAMILLY WAS TREATED AND TALK TO LIKE we were a huge problem by NAOMI.   We came at 7:30 and left at 9:00pm . That makes no sense !   No one should have to wait in between interactions with the waitress as long as we did tonight.

When we declined the liquor we stopped being served properly which was ridiculous.

This has happened several times in each of our experiences at this restaurant. I have contacted the health department about this issue as well.

For the most part, he was what saved my review from being two stars. The presentation of the food was alright and it tasted good. The endless appetizers was worth it because for the amount my friend and I paid, we would have spent more if we got the appetizers a la carte. Definitely seize the opportunity for endless appetizers while it is still being promoted by TGI Fridays!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-south-gate,2.04,2.07,2.04,1.9000000000000001,2.0580000000000003

On another note, costumer service was no good at all we got this girl             As our server and it doesn't get worse than her she was practically kicking us out of the place because she had something to do and needed to get out, and attitude every time Sebastian a question ,, literally got my water refilled 1 time and because I gm had to wave her down mind u there weren't that many people she was just too bussy cleaning her tables and chores because she wanted to go party, it's not free food , smh, she should be demoted to the dish washer,!!

I recently read an article saying that millennials  are not really into this type of food, and it's true.... Parking:  - shared parking lot with other places b/c it's in a plaza, but it's convenient b/c you can also go to CVS, Walmart, Ross, Marshalls, Michaels, and whatever else is in the plaza Liked:  - The wait to be seated was not that long (went on a Friday night around 6 PM), when we left there was a long line of people  - Waitress was nice and patient  - the ability to pay with the Ziosk tablet (but the one at my table died right when I was about to swipe...) but before it died, it allowed you to easily split the bill and attempt to pay Disliked: - Waitress was not as attentive-- I had wings as an appetizer and my meals had just arrived, but she didn't take away the plate of wings (which were just bones at that time), also did not get a refill on water until the very end  - Ziosk tablet that you can use to ""Call Server"" but I don't think it actually works because my light was just blinking for the remainder of the dinner - Ziosk tablet has games and various entertainment, BUT THEY DON""T TELL YOU THE PRICE. My friend and I had played one game while we waited for the food to arrive and it was $1.99.....could have just bought an app on my phone that I got to keep at that price. We didn't see it until we were going to pay Best Part:  - I ordered a 1/2 rack ribs and shrimp, the ribs were well cooked and the meat fell right off nicely (but the shrimp could have had more flavor)  Return: - Most likely not, I just came because I wanted to try it (I've never had TGI Fridays before)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-south-gate,2.2,2.12,2.044,1.864,2.152

TGI Friday's, especially in South Gate proved that it's worse than chili's and apple bees combined. On a mediocore semi-busy night, it seemed as if I was sitting down for an hour before they finally gave me my terrible plate of food. It turned out that it had in fact been well over an hour that I ordered my food. After my third visit in 2 weeks here, they got worse and worse. They took so long that knew they had to do something so they gave me my appetizer for free which is probably what they do to everybody who complains about their wait times.
