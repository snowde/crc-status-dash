100,Sonja M.,"Springfield, VA",6,10,,2.0,2012-01-26,"I was at this location two nights ago, and sat at the bar with a friend of mine.  We had a horrible experience.  Bartenders helped people around us, but completely ignored us unless we talked to them.  When someone's drink is empty, a bartender should ask if they want another, right? We ordered 3 appetizers - the Tuscan Flatbread, the Mozzarella Sticks, and the Potato Skins.  The first two were okay, but the potato skins were horrible.  The potatoes tasted dry and stale.  The cheese was gross and oily.  I know that it's not health food, but this was BAD! Drinks were ok when we got them, but like I said, that didn't happen often.  There were 3 bartenders, and the bar was not full.  We got attitude from 2 of the bartenders, and I'm not sure why.  Did they think we should have fallen over ourselves to impress them??  No. I worked at a TGI Friday's years ago, and I know how employees were trained.  They are clearly not trained properly or well.  The TGIF on King Street in Alexandria does not have ANY of these problems.  I will not be going back to the TGIF in Springfield EVER AGAIN.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6?start=140,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.4080000000000004

117,Kasey M.,"Chester, VA",0,5,,1.0,2012-04-20,"I have never been to a Fridays before, but this was the only restaurant close to my hotel so I decided to try it. As soon as I walked in there was a security guard who made a really weird face when he saw me. I ignored it and looked for the hostesses. There were 2 hostesses both just leaning back against a wall. I walked over to them and they both just stared at me and didn't say anything. They didn't say hi, they didn't ask if I wanted to sit down, absolutely nothing. I finally realized they weren't interested in working so I just asked if I could sit at the bar. The bartender was absolutely great and if she was the only person I dealt with I would have given a better rating. The food was sub-par, nothing great. I complained to the manager about the hostess and he didn't really seem like he cared, he just pretty much said ""oh well if you're sitting at the bar, then you don't need to be seated"" That wasn't really the point, but ok?

The walls have built up grim and food splatter.   The customer service is horrible.  My father asked that his food be taken back because it was not cooked all the way.  He didnt say anything just took it back. When he brought it back, he still didnt say anything. Not a word!  When he brought the check, it was $160! We were a group of 7 people and the majority of us got the 2 for $10 and we only had soft drinks.  The receipt that he gave us was not itemized, which was unusual. The items read: food, tax, and tip (he added 18% eventhough we did not have 8 people).   We told him that we think something was wrong with our receipt. He explained to us that because we used a coupon for a free app, they could not give us the 2 for $10.  He was very rude and said that there was nothing that he could do about it.  When we asked to see the manager, he came back with a receipt that had the correct amount on it with no tip, this time.  We asked to see the manager again and he asked ""Why? its correct."" We said again we wanted to see a manager and he said ""Oh my god"" and walked away.   When the manager came, he was just as rude as the waitor. He told us to ""stop talking so that he could explain.""  Really?!? He then told us the exact same that thing the waitor said and was talking to us as if were idiots.  He just kept defending the waitor, instead of realizing what the problem was. He clearly did not know how to be a manager! If the waitor would have told us in the begining that we could not use a coupon with the 2 for $10 deal, there would have not been a problem.

I got an appetizer that I've been getting for a while...and it tasted horrible. The cheese in my spicy queso looked like ranch dressing with too many herbs in it (before it was literally just white cheese). The manager came over to address my concerns with it. Her first question to me seemed nice, but as soon as I told her my concern, she became snappy and aggressive.  To top it all off, she told all her employees that they only give military discount if you're in your uniform.  Get your stuff together, Friday's.

I think we could have paid it (it was much lower than our bill) and left and she wouldn't have noticed. It took over two hours for dinner because service was so slow.

Bingo!  This might not be bad.  We arrived on a Friday night going on 7 and were told a 15-20 minute wait, not awful, but less than ten minutes later we were shown to our booth. Nice! Booth was comfortable. Lately most booths I've been in have miles of space between bench and table and I end up perched uncomfortably on the edge of my seat to reach my food, this booth was nicely spaced. Waitress arrived promptly, took our drinks order and as we told her we were ready to order, our meal order as well. Husband ordered off the Right Portion Right Price menu so his meal was under 750 cal. Dragonfire Chicken with Jasmine Rice Pilaf and Broccoli. He said it was quite nice with a good balance of spicy (Kung Pao sauce) and sweet (fruit pieces). The broccoli was nicely cooked, bright green and still crisp like he prefers. I ordered flat iron steak (300 cal) with the langostino lobster topping (270 cal), mashed potatoes (my splurge at 210 cal) and mozzarella and tomato salad (90). The mozzarella and tomato salad is probably better in the summer but everything else was delicious and nicely portioned.  If you are watching what you eat a look at their nutrition info online first, or on your smartphone if you're already there, is a good idea as most of the menu is over the top high in calories, even items you may think of as good choices.

My boyfriend ordered a steak and an alcoholic drink. I had the Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta, it was good just typical tgi Fridays food.

I'm only giving this 2 stars because when we first arrived we asked if we could get a table top for 20 guests... the host stated we could but it would be a wait (about 20-30min), so we said that's fine since all of the party wasn't there yet.  Once the entire party was there we went in to advise and also to see how much longer of a wait it would be (since we had already been there about 40min)... the host then told us that we would have to wait until the other group (where they planned to seat us) leaves before we can be seated, and since they had just been served their desserts the wait will probably be another 20min.  I was pretty upset at this point (because they had plenty tables open that they could of pieced together, why did we have to wait on a specific table to get up?!?!?!!), but I kept my cool.  As we sat there (in the front of the restaurant; inside & outside), watching all of these customers walk in and get seated (after we were told to wait an additional 20min) I was done!  So I went back in to express my disapproval/concern & also to see what the deal was because it had been over an hour & a half at this point, that they put us on ""pause""; that's when they realized they were wrong & told us that they have the table ready so we can come in now and be seated.  My whole thing was if they had told us UPFRONT that it would have taken that long for us to get that table top we would have had the option to either stay and wait, make a change to the request or leave and find a different restaurant all together!!!  That was a piss poor judgment/move & made it so I (and probably some of my other family members) will never frequent this location again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6?start=80,2.32,2.32,2.32,1.6400000000000001,2.32

Setting the mood: The sky was dark and filled with stars, and it was Christmas Eve. We were already out and about trying to finish up some last minute shopping.  We called ahead to TGIF to make sure that the place is still open. They didn't close until 8:00pm, so we decided to head there and eat dinner. Of course we are filled with holiday cheer and joy because its Christmas time. So, we walk in and one of the hosts begins to take us to our seats. We ask to be seated in a booth section and she says okay thats not a problem, BUT! I just so happened to have turned around to see the other folks that were also having dinner. The other host was giving us an evil look, the kind of look where someone cuts their eyes to the conner of their eye sockets wanting to say something. We brushed it off though. We get to our booth and long story short, throughout the whole meal I am seeing this woman give my girl looks all night long. My girl is the one who asked for our seats to be changed, so I figured it had something to do with that. Not 100% sure, but thats just what I gathered from what was going on. Never said anything to her though, because it was Christmas time and we were in a good mood just being with each other. My reason for sharing this with you, Ive read a few reviews where people have encountered problems as well at this very same location. Other than that, its time for the food review. The food wasn't bad, not a big TGIF fan, the food is okay at best. The wings I had last night were pretty good, I believe they were flavored with Memphis BBQ. I must say, I actually enjoyed that. Id order it again whenever we go back, it taste better than the Jack Daniels wings to me. Their Strawberry Lemonade was pretty good too. Im very big on lemonade, so I always order lemonade wherever I go. Don't have much to say about this place, its your typical ""lets go somewhere and chill"" type spot if you're hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6?start=40,2.28,2.28,2.28,1.736,2.28

He took forever to bring us our drinks, when our food finally came by someone other than our server my husbands meal was not at all what he ordered. His burger was 90% iceberg lettuce. We had waited so long for our food at that point we just ate and by the time the server actually came by to check on us we just let him know what happened with his meal. He offered to comp his meal which was nice of him, we didn't ask for that or expect it but he did. When he came back he didn't say a word just handed us the bill and when my husband gave him his card for payment and he came back with the slip to sign again he said nothing. No have a good night, sorry for the delay or the mistake nothing. He acted so rudely toward us as though we had thrown a fit at him or something.

This TGIF is decent sized but it seems that every time I come, they are low on staff, which makes the patrons dining here suffer because there are long waits at a time for drinks, food, or additional items you may need during your meal.  Now, I don't blame the wait staff, they try very hard to attend to everyone's needs, but I blame management. Why are you guys consistently having one waiter on staff for 10 tables? Wth!!! Ugh! Do something about it!  The food is great! Never had any issues. It's fresh, hot, & tastes amazing! The drinks here are kinda watered down which sucks because if I taste a strong, premium, speciality cocktail at five other TGIFs, I should not come here to order the same drink but in water form. No dice!  All in all, great location! Great environment during the games. The employees are also very friendly & nice!  Favs: The food & bar environment!

The first problem here was that it was 5:00 on a SUNDAY (kind of early for dinner but we were in the neighborhood) and the place was packed. It took our server a good 15-20 minutes to come and take our drink orders. She apologetically told us that they were understaffed and experiencing a huge rush in parties over 5. I even noticed the hostess bringing drink orders and helping much to the annoyance of people waiting to be seated. I saw our waitress maybe 10 tens tops during the night, each time she apologized profusely for overlooking us. Between each order of appetizers it took about 35 minutes making this a LOOOOONG experience. We ordered the appetizers and got the first batch: buffalo boneless wings and BBQ flatbread. The wings were okay but nothing to write home about because they tasted more like breading than chicken. The BBQ flatbread was good, if not a little messy from over-saucing. The second round: crispy green beans and potstickers. The green beans were served at molten temperature but delicious and the potstickers tasted like any non-Chinese person made potsticker I have ever had. Third round, mozzarella sticks and loaded potato skins: these are arguably the more famous appetizers on their menu and both underwhelmed. The mozzarella had bubbled out of half of the sticks while frying leaving a hollow skin of breading shaped like a cheese stick. The potato skins were almost all potato and no topping leaving a gummy-bland taste.

Why weren't we informed that the food was ready? I have never had to go to the bar to get my food since this specific location brings out the food to the lobby which is where you pay.

Who in their right mind would willingly pay $17 for a mediocre Mojito? I did not know they changed the policy until I got the bill and almost crapped my pants when I saw $34 for two Mojitos.

156,James L.,"Springfield, VA",71,104,136.0,1.0,2016-12-21,"It's been over 10 years since I last ate at a TGI Fridays...and point of fact I probably wouldn't have even considered stepping foot into another TGIF's if not for the Groupon I had.  Hard to believe that at one time, TGIF's was considered a ""cool"" place to hang out with your friends while getting served by folks wearing red striped shirts and suspenders adorned with wacky buttons or ""flair"". Thankfully the servers aren't attired in the cheesy get-up anymore, but the food is just as I remembered.  Bland, uninspired, and taste like it was re-heated off a Sysco truck. My dining companion and I ordered a rack of ribs with TGI Friday's famous Jack Daniels sauce and a cheeseburger.  Pretty generic fare and I figured and hard to mess up....WRONG!  The ribs were so dry that pulling the meat from the bone caused it splinter into little pieces like peanut brittle.  But the cheeseburger was the worst part of the meal.   After a few bites, my friend immediately pulled out something dark from the hamburger patty.  It appeared to be a corner of the meat that was over cooked to the point that it was charred.  But that wasn't the worst of it.  Because the end of the patty was so hard and over cooked, it actually chipped her tooth! So lesson learned for me.  Even if Groupon is offering a $15 for $30 deal - just AVOID!   There is a reason TGI Friday's has to resort to gimmicks like unlimited appetizers or Groupons to drum up business - because their food is sub par and the decor is stuck in the 90's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6,2.08,2.29,2.29,1.7000000000000002,2.2060000000000004

121,Preti N.,"Houston, TX",0,4,4.0,1.0,2017-01-28,"Utterly the worst situation I have been in. The most incompetent pair of bartenders I've seen in any restaurant. They don't even acknowledge ANYONE who sits down at the bar. If you get to actually order your food it is auctioned off as if it's a free raffle. And then everyone gets to breath all over it because whoever runs the food out they leave it in front of anyone. Other people joking around saying it's theirs, then finally one bartender will remember who ordered it and by time they get it it's probably cool. Not like anyone cares if you like your food or not because no one checks to see.  If you do need anything sauce, napkin, your food hopefully another guest will see you trying to get the bartenders attention and maybe just maybe they can get them for you. And just maybe you can get everything you need to FINALLY eat your meal. Oh no maybe not because someone else's meal is all over you silverware. Come the F on!!# Really!!##&€*/? I ask for plasticware just to enjoy my Mac and cheese, but great there is no cheese just oil and noodles oh a little bit of cheese that is dried on. Dont make excuses for that either. I have had that same Mac n cheese at the kings street location and it was good. Could you have at lease tried to make it eatable.  Seriously you all should be ashamed at your service. Corporate should just let everyone of you go and start some fresh hiring. Its so sad that that is how you treat anyone. If you would not want your own mother to get that kind of treatment then don't dish it. Take pride in what you do even if it is working at tgi Fridays.

We finally got a server he was nice but very slow and never brought the food he forgot about us. What disappointed me the most is that several bartenders, servers and even the manager walked past our table and saw that we had nothing except waters and didn't even bother to ask us if we were ok. Here is the curve ball, I have been to several TGIF and I understand how crowded and busy they get. However tonight it was dead we were maybe the 4th table seated at the bar.

This restaurant has the most consistently bad customer service of any restaurant I have ever been to. Are you surprised I gave it two stars? Yes I'm surprised as well. But, the food was good and the Manager tried to save the day by being nice and offering a free desert coupon. But it's a little to late. What I should say is what food we got was good. BECAUSE WE DIDN'T GET EVERYTHING WE ORDERED. Look at the picture of our receipt. You will see the appetizer $12.99 taken off our bill. That's because we never got it. But it didn't end with them losing just $12.99. When we go to TGI Friday's we always order an appetizer and have two drinks and then order our meal. Since our main course came out and we never got the appetizer, it cost them three drinks too. That's about $30. The waiter wasn't great either. I won't mention his name because I don't do that. But the last waiter we had at this restaurant was also lack luster. We didn't get pineapple or a cherry in our Lava Flow either. What's up with that? I will now only patronize the Tyson's Corner Center TGI Friday's. The difference is like night and day. You can't even really compare them that are so different. It would be like comparing a prison dinning room with Morton's Steakhouse. The difference is so vast.

154,Mariah S.,"Washington, DC",69,316,620.0,2.0,2017-03-27,"Came in today after 1pm for a late lunch. Not busy at all so why is the hostess taking her time to seat us? We were only 3. She also needs to smile and greet customers cheerfully which didn't happen. Her face was sullen and she moved with no energy to her.  In contrast, the food server was very pleasant. She offered us chips and salsa on the house while we were looking at the menu. Friday's has a not too extensive nor impressive lunch menu which is limited to sliders, chicken salad, and I think it was a quesadilla and maybe half a sandwich. It was a little odd to see how the main entrees did not come with sides. You have to purchase it separately. And the prices didn't seem to reflect a la cart since other similar chain restaurants like chilis, daves bbq, etc offer sides with their meals for the same price at Fridays.  Review of the following:  Combo appetizer-wings (6 pieces) fried mozzarella sticks (4 pieces) potato skins (4 pieces) and potstickers (4 pieces) - skins were a bit dry and chewy. Seemed like they and the sticks had been sitting under a heat lamp. The cheese was not gooey or hot just solid and temp was lukewarm. I ordered the garlic parm wings and was presented with wings that had buffalo sauce. I told the server and she apologized and made it right. Wings came back seasoned with a tasty buttery garlic sauce hot from the fryer. Kids meal - mac and cheese, mandarin oranges, chocolate milk. Good sized portion for a 12-yr-old. The server was attentive and helpful despite the kitchen goof.  They are running an appetizer promo $10 for select menu items. I would go back for the unlimited wings but not much else. Fridays was a big hit back in the day. It was fun to eat there and the food had more variety.

When we arrived, the hostess was on the house phone and asked us to wait by putting up her finger...we did for about a minute and decided to move to the bar area where we sat in a booth.  I retrieved menus from the bartender and sat down, but realized that although the table was bussed, it was not wiped down thoroughly because it was sticky.  We got up and moved to a table in the dining area after being seated by another host.  We waited for approximately ten minutes before our waiter arrived and we placed our order...about fifteen more minutes before my draft beer was served; and another fifteen to twenty minutes after my beer arrived, our food arrived.  Great...unfortunately, we did not have our eating utensils so I got up and grabbed a few sets from close to the front door.  Our server came by to ask how our meal was doing, even before we took a bite from our delicious burgers.  As we were taking our last bites of our tasty and juicy burgers, the bill arrived.  It was about the early thing that was quick. There are other places in the area that I have not yet tried...I will try them and cross off TGIF as one not to visit again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6?start=20,2.32,2.16,2.16,,2.224
127,Joanne V.,"Alexandria, VA",0,10,1.0,4.0,2017-08-19,This is one of my favorite Fridays location. I've had nothing but good experiences here. Sometimes the wait can be a little long but that is understandable because I do visit this location only on weekends when I am in the area. I've visited Fridays in Alexandria and let's just say that I would drive the distance to this location any day whenever I am craving for Fridays!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6?start=40,2.4,2.19,2.19,,2.274

I used to LOVE their chicken fingers when I was younger, but they've changed the batter and these were not good. Super hard and crispy, unlike the light batter they used to use. I ordered a strawberry lemonade for my daughter and it tasted like water with muddled strawberries added. Everyone else enjoyed their food though, and our server was attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6,2.44,2.17,2.17,,2.278

Since college I have had many foods. I think I learned a lot about food quality since then. Let's just say this is a trip down memory lane I will not take again. From now on if I want junk food I will indulge with just some straight up fast food- Wendy's or something.

159,Deborah R.,"Falls Church, VA",34,4,,2.0,2017-10-15,Came to this TGIF because my family received a coupon in the mail. Service was mediocre and the food was terrible. The burger was completely dry and over cooked and my spouses meal did not come out correctly. We never received drink refills and the restaurant was nearly empty with a ton of servers. The servers attitude did improve when she brought the check though. Of course.... I won't be going back to any TGIF period.

They totally butchered my Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta. The dish used to be so great, now it just tastes like pasta with cream and Texas Pete hot sauce poured on top of it, with the addition of rubbery chicken. I told my waitress and she said the chicken comes like that and it's all premade? Okay. Still not acceptable, we went around 6:30 not that busy YET!

142,Irving H.,"Annandale, VA",6,19,20.0,1.0,2017-11-13,"I used to occasionally hit up TGIF for their endless apps. I liked it because they were open later than most other establishments. Their food was always lack luster, but it was cheap, so I can't argue with that. You get what you pay for.  Recently, they rose their price from $10 to $15. That's a 50% increase, for those keeping score at home. They actually decreased the number of options on the app menu. The $15 price puts them on par with other buffets with WAY better options.  I will not be returning to TGIF again. Not here or any other location. Also, why don't they clean their bathrooms with that extra $5 I gave them?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6,2.68,2.15,2.15,,2.362
149,Tamara H.,"Annandale, VA",1,6,1.0,2.0,2017-11-28,"So I arrived her for dinner on 11/28/17 around 6:30.  I waited several minutes at the door for the host to come and seat me.  She ends up taking me over to John' s section and tells me he will be right with me.  I look at the menu and decide what I'd like to eat.  I figured it out with 5 minutes or so.... unfortunately no one  came over to greet me or take my order after 10 minutes.  I end up stopping the hostess to let her know no one has come over.  She then tells me he probably didn't see me and points in his direction. He's directly across from me now serving a table that came after me... I let her know that he saw me because he was across from me, looked at me and continued  chatting with a fellow waitress for several minutes.  She then went and told him I was waiting. She then just says he'll be right over.  At this point it's about 13 minutes in and I just get up and walk to the bar.  I almost left except I was really hungry.  I walked by the hostess again to tell her I'm switching sections  to which she barely even acknowledges me .   Apparently it's not a big deal for a customer to get up and leave for non service.  I ended up sitting at the bar and the waitress greeted me within the first minute and took my order in the next.  She saved it from getting 1 star.  Not that anyone will probably care.  If the management is anything like the employees it won't even matter ..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6,2.68,2.16,2.16,,2.3680000000000003

A group of 4 came in 10 mins after I did, and the bar back bitch told them that the bartender (bitch) would be with them shortly.

141,Jessica E.,"Franconia, VA",126,69,411.0,3.0,2018-01-13,"We headed to TGI Fridays yesterday for a late dinner because well, thank God it was Friday! The parking lot was packed but we were still able to be seated right away. We sat down at about 8:30pm. I noticed that it was extremely loud. They were pretty busy, because it took our server about 10 minutes to come by, say hello, and get our drink orders.  I do want to say that she wasn't bad. She was extremely nice, just not the most attentive. We would go long stretches without seeing her, while we waited for a century for our drinks and food to arrive. A big pet peeve of mine is getting my drink order at the same time as my food. I was worried this was going to happen, but luckily (sort of?) the food took even longer than expected so I could enjoy my drink and even order a second one lol. No judgements! This was all before our food came out.   A half hour later, we got our drinks. And THEN our food came at 9:20pm, with my second drink. We were there for FOREVER! I had the Regal Apple Sangria and the Tito's Mule, while Jeff had the Seasonal Sam Adam's - Cold Snap. The Apple Sangria didn't wow me, but the Mule did! The lime and ginger beer cut the vodka perfectly! Besides the obnoxious wait time, the food was excellent. I ordered the Mac and Cheese Burger with a side of Chrispy Brussel Sprouts and Jeff just ordered from the appetizer menu, getting onion rings and sliders with a side of fries. My burger was cooked perfectly and the combination of the mac and cheese and bacon were heavenly. I liked how they prepared the mac and cheese to be in a sort of crust, to keep it all together while still being ooey and gooey.  The brussel sprouts were seasoned and dressed really well too. Balsamic goes so well with these!  So overall, I had a pretty good evening, but I think next time I'll just order out and avoid having to eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6,2.8,2.25,2.25,,2.47
