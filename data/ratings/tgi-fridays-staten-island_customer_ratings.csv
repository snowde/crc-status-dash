The word happy should be removed because i didnt leave any happier then when i arrived. Something about pounding a beer while children are coloring 5 ft away is a bit depraved. The buy back NY staple does not exist but im sure not the bartenders fault just a greedy corporate policy. The burgers used to be above average but im sure has gone down considerably in quality. Just grab a six pack and get happy elsewhere.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island?start=80,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006

I went to this location about 4 months ago, my boyfriend and friend each got a draft beer- different types, both tasted like florally mothball mildew.  Asked the waiter if maybe it was a soapy glass, he gave us new glasses (wet) I don't know if he poured new beer or not but it still tasted like ass.  They don't clean their tap lines.  Came here a few days ago again: same thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island?start=80,2.468,2.468,2.468,2.468,2.468

The spinach dip was great. The tacos which I substituted for chicken were HORRIBLE. The taco shells smelled like my cats litter box (no joke). The lettuce was AWFUL with really spicy dressing. The chicken was reasonable. Then we got the 2 for 12 with the wedge salad and the bruschetta chicken pasta. The wedge salad was okay (but what can you do to salad!) The only complaint I had was that there was raw bacon on top. The bruschetta chicken pasta we a still deciding if we liked it or not. It tasted like balsamic vinegar and marinara sauce. The chicken was okay though. Then we got the Parmesan encrusted chicken. The ""tomato salad"" was a few small pieces of tomato with about 4 mozzarella balls.

26,Simon W.,"New York, NY",44,93,18.0,4.0,2013-10-04,"This place is pretty good. However, the service seems to be a bit slow on a week night so not sure if that comes to play. If you sign up for the Stripe Membership program (FREE). You can get unlimited chips & salsa everytime you go. That's $3.99 a plate EACH time. They gave us 3 plates of that. A saving of nearly $12! Also I presented a coupon that I get for a being a member using my cellphone. A received a free entree (i ordered 2 of the same. Steak & Lobster Tail) The dish was really good. Filling as well. The tail was only 4 oz so you need to really savor it and eat it slow because then you will feel like that little tail is then worth it. Steak looks like it was about 8oz. I don't recall. Comes with 2 sides. Not too many selections in this department. Mash potatoes wasn't anything special and the seasoned fries were just pepper and salt.  I want to mention that I usually get medium for my steak, but i think mine was more towards the medium well. Not much red on mine so it made it a little bit dry. My waiter came to us multiple times to see if we need anything and gave us an awkward look each time because I CAN'T HEAR HIM! and I don't need anything each time he asked. However, when it was time for us to get the check. I waited for a good 5 minutes to see him. I figured Nature Call was giving him a ring or something so it's understandable. I tipped at the subtotal before the free entree. When leaving the waiter was standing near the entrance/exit door on his phone. That's why he was not showing up for so long!

32,Mike O.,"Staten Island, NY",10,14,,1.0,2014-05-27,"We went this past Friday which was a holiday Friday so we should have known that service would be poor but we were in the neighborhood and since the Outback had a wait out the door we figured why not. We would soon learn why not  We walk in and despite there being many open tables we were told it would be a 15 minute wait. Odd but not a problem since the bar was empty so we walk over to get a drink at the bar which was very sticky. That was probably caused by the fact that the servers fill the drinks to the top of the glasses but instead of texting in between pouring drinks maybe you should be cleaning up the bar so it is more welcoming to customers and  maybe they stay for a drink or two and give you more money. what a concept! Anyway the drinks were ok, how could you mess up bottles of beer though? After waiting 5 minutes we are called and sat at a table by the bar which is not only filthy but it is crooked and as I put down my drink which was in a glass it spills over the table, no worries though as I am sure our server will be over soon. I am wrong The waitress for our section walked past us 3 times without a word while checking on the two tables to the side of us on each pass through. We had to get the hostess to call the waitress to our attention and when she did the waitress again went to the wrong table! Her service did not get better from there as we barely saw her for the rest of our time. We never got a drink refill and I am sure the only reason why we received the bill is because she was obligated to do so as she probably knew her tip would be less than the cost of a beer down the shore. I guess I should mention the food, It was edible especially if you enjoy salt.  We will not be going back and after speaking to a few people about our experience they have said the same.

I was here late night graving some drinks and finish a business contract. The drinks were not up to the standard in coldness. My clients drink was changed twice however do was happy with my tap.

The only appetizing part of my meal was the fountain soda. To start off the edge of the potato skin was burnt. The cocktail for the shrimp was watery. Thankfully there was no hair on it like the last time I came to this tgif Friday's. With the appetizers being unsatisfactory I was looking forward to the main meal. That was even more of a disappointment. My boyfriend ordered rib-eye and lobster tail. The presentation of his meal was very good. However the presentation of my meal looked like something you would serve to a dog. I ordered the rice with salmon and lobster. The rice was disheveled and it looked as though someone ate from it before it was served to me. I brought it up to an employee who sent over the manager. The manager came right away and I addressed the situation to him. He apologized and told me he's going back in the kitchen to get me a new order. It took about 10-15 minutes to get my new order and it finally looked presentable. The taste of the food however was not spot on. The rice was okay and the salmon was too burnt.

And we didnt even get drinks yet. I had to ask the host to take our drink and appetizer order and it still hasn't arrived. I dont even have a glass of water. This is by far the worst I have ever seen it. If they don't get their act together they will be losing tons of customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island,1.32,1.32,1.32,,1.32
51,Gail M.,"Staten Island, NY",16,4,2.0,1.0,2017-09-15,"My friend took me out for my birthday tonight. Service was horrible!  Manager was trying to be helpful, but really wasn't.  In the end we only paid for two appetizers, and 2 drinks.  My friend's Cobb salad had chicken that was like rubber.   And she never got her basket of fries!   Asked where it was 5 times! My baked potato that came with my steak was charred black!  But steak and Jasmine rice was great. Asked for another baked potato. It didn't come. Had to keep asking for it.  Finally got onr and took it home. My Pina Colada was gross! Sent it back and had a tiramasu martini that was great.  This place used to be great years ago, but not anymore.  Place was virtually empty except for the bar.  And for a Friday night, that's not good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island,1.2,1.2,1.2,,1.2
43,Jackie S.,"Staten Island, NY",110,148,489.0,3.0,2017-09-16,"Went here with my brother for the unlimited appetizers. Firstly, the place was empty and I'm always skeptical about that. Also , they now raised the prices from 10$ a head to 13$ for the unlimited apps. Another thing I didn't know was that it was only appetizers from a selected menu- I thought it was all the appetizers they had. You also are only allowed to order one per person at a time and each of them took forever to come. Service was slow despite the fact that no one was in there. Another thing I wasn't happy about was that there was one of those tablets on the table for the games and my brother and I started playing them thinking they were free and when we got the bill they charged it to there. I didn't like that and it's not clear that it will be added to your bill later most restaurants make you swipe your credit card before playing. Anyway the food isn't horrible I don't think you can mess up boneless wings , nachos , mozzarella sticks and whatever other basic food items were on the menu. Probably won't come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island,1.28,1.28,1.28,,1.28
50,James S.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",53,20,66.0,3.0,2017-09-17,So me and my sister were shopping at the mall and we were a bit hungry after we left. We were not so sure what we wanted to eat. But then we saw TGI Fridays and we would like oh what the hell why don't we just eat there we haven't ate there in a while. And literally haven't ate there in over eight years. The place was not busy at all. Maybe like only 10 parties in the entire Friday's. It's got a cool and attractive decor inside with all the wall decals and lights. We sat down and checked out the menu and decided on just doing the unlimited appetizers for lunch. The waiter took a bit long to come over and take our drink order. Then finally came over with the drinks of waiting another 10 mins. We told the waiter we wanted every appetizer and she said you can't do that. One appetizer per person. We were a bit confused we wanted all the appetizers in front of our face. But instead we had to eat 2 tiny portions of appetizers and wait for the waiter to Come back over and put 2 more orders in. We wasted a lot of time doing that. Especially how small the portions were. They even raised there prices from 10$ to 13$ To be completely honest the only 2 best appetizers were the buffalo wings and loaded potato skins. The meatballs tasted almost frozen! The bbq chicken flatbread was gross looking! It didn't even look edible. We didn't even touch it. They even did something pretty messed up. They had that tablet on the table where you can play games while you wait for the food. So we started playing it and we thought it was free because it didn't ask us to pay. Them at the end when we got the bill we got charged an extra 2$ and we didn't even know.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island,1.36,1.36,1.36,,1.36
53,Alex S.,"Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, NY",35,30,8.0,2.0,2017-10-01,"Came here 2 times on consecutive Saturdays and I don't think I will be coming back. Both times my family was seated in a small round corner table with barely any room on the table. The first Saturday we came here, 3/5 of us ordered the endless apps. They didn't have the nachos on that day. It wasn't busy so they allowed us to order 2 apps at a time each time. The wait for them was some time. The second Saturday we came here, it was only 4 of us. 2/4 of us ordered the endless apps because they weren't too bad the first time around. This time the meatballs came out ice cold and extra rubbery. The chicken and the mozzarella sticks seams to be the only things you can never go wrong with at this place. I had also order d French onion soup here and they put 2 pieces of burnt bread and barely any onions and hardly any cheese. Major disappointment. Also it was lukewarm. Wasn't even worth sending back because our waitress was as slow as molasses. She hardly ever came back to check on us. The food also took over an hour to come out. Apps should never take that long since everyone knows there already pre cooked. I also got the potato skins cause you can't mess that up either, but they did. They were dried out and had very little cheese on it. The place wasn't even that crowded. And the fact that we had to wait sooo long for the good was ridiculous. This place needs to work on more timely service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island,1.4,1.4,1.4,,1.4

2,Joe L.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",0,2,,1.0,2017-10-23,"I saw my friend walking out as i was walking in and he tells me hope you have time cause your going to be a while.  We sat in the bar area and boy was he not lying.  It took them 20 minutes to take our drink order and mind you there were only 4 tables being used.  Our waitress was helping tend bar with the other bartender which I guess somewhat explains it but regardless doesn't really make it any better.  So you can only imagine how long it took to get our dinner order in and get our food.  The shame of it was that the food was actually pretty good, but of coarse I won't tell you that what it took to get another drink.  At one point I had to walk over to the bar to place our reorder.  It seems that this place is really going down hill because my mom and sister went the week before and shared the same complaints that I had.  I sure hope they can fix this problem because the food is pretty decent but there's no way possible that I am willing to keep coming back with such a poorly run establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island?start=20,1.52,1.52,1.52,,1.5200000000000002
