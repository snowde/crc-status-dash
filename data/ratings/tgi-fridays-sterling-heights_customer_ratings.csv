64,Eric K.,"Mountain View, CA",0,20,,2.0,2012-01-03,"Our well attired group of six walked into this half empty T.G.I. Friday's on a slow Monday night during the Christmas holiday.  Two patrons in dirty blue jeans sat in the bar area, slumped forward over their drinks.  The bartender scowled at us from across the room. At the bar, beer foam coagulated and dripped out of spill mats and pooled on the floor.  At the hostess station, the lone waitress cast an irritated glance at us.  While walking away from us, she shouted that our table would be ready in a few minutes. The ladies of our group used the opportunity to visit the restroom.  Upon their return, the gentlemen did the same.  Both the ladies and gentlemen had the same experiences in their respective restrooms: appalling filth.  My wife was savagely attacked by one of the toilet paper holders.  Everyone's shoe soles had to be soaked in a weak bleach solution upon returning home that night because of the quarter inch deep sewage coating the bathroom floors. At this point, a total of five minutes had elapsed.  We waited another two minutes, with no updates or response from the wait staff. Sensing the indifference of the waitresses, our group made the collective decision through mental telepathy to high tail across the various curbs and the entry drives from Van Dyke, and finally across the sopping wet grass to the Papa Vino's Italian restaurant next store, a sort of Olive Garden knock off.  Upon entering Papa Vino's, a smiling gentleman with a charming Foreign accent greeted us at once.  We had drinks and bread within a few minutes at our table, and everyone were pleased. Perhaps the boss at the T.G.I. Friday's was in Cancun the week we visited and the wait staff were enjoying a vacation of their own by ignoring customers.  We'll probably never know, because there is no good reason to come to this  T.G.I. Friday's except if the wait at Buddy's down the road is really really long.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sterling-heights?start=60,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001

66,Julie G.,"Hazel Park, MI",9,92,,3.0,2013-07-12,"Haven't been to a Fridays in quite a while so we decided to stop in around 7 ish on a Friday night.  Parking lot was packed so we were concerned that there would be a long wait but there wasn't and we were seated right away.  Hostess was very nice and offered us a smaller two person booth or a larger one--very nice to be given the choice since my dining partner is a larger person.  Typical chain restaurant and ambiance, not as loud as some of the other Friday's I've been to in the area.  Menu looked decent, lots of steak specials and another two person meal deal that seems to be the fad in the chain restaurants lately.  Server was excellent--friendly and very attentive.  The food was a bit of a let down though.  We ordered nachos and they came in what looked like half tortilla size portions.  Like 3 tortillas halved and then nacho fixings (two little scoops of sour cream/guacamole).  Why not just quarter the chips or just pile some chips on the platter?  Tasted good but looked weird.  My burger was just okay, nothing really special.  Not much bleu cheese and didn't look anything like the picture.  For almost  $10 I got a small burger and an even smaller portion of sweet potato fries--maybe 12 on the plate.  I could have gone to Five Guys and got a better burger for the money.  Oh well, it wasn't horrible since my dining partner really enjoyed his steak.  Not sure if this place is worth the money on regular entrees, might come back for the two for deals though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sterling-heights?start=60,1.9000000000000001,1.9000000000000001,1.9000000000000001,1.9000000000000001,1.9000000000000004

Pros: it was Monday night and we paid about $8 for 4 appetizers, which was a great deal. How, you ask? Monday night is half-off appetizer night, we got the mozzarella sticks, potstickers, and beef skewers, all of which were yummy, plus the chips and salsa. I'm a Stripes member so the chips were free, and I also had a free app coupon from my last time (from filling out the survey on the receipt). Another pro: the hostess was very nice, and seated us promptly. Cons: The waitress was fast but highly inattentive. Had to wait a while for a water refill. She wasn't that friendly too ... not MEAN or anything per say but just not that friendly. I went to use the bathroom and there was toilet paper and paper towels everywhere. We had a group of children with their parents near us and they were super, super loud (obviously not the restaurant's fault, but still ...) and the parents just let them sit there and scream all night.  I'd go back here again but ONLY if I was in the area ... Van Dyke seems to have a lot of other chains too though, so there are more choices.

58,Kimmie A.,"Warren, MI",174,1,,1.0,2015-06-09,"Went into this location on a Thursday afternoon after work with my 2 year old son. Keep in mind, I'm also a waitress/bartender so I understand the ins and outs of the service industry. Upon entering the establishment, we were greeted by a kind and smiling hostess who sat us in the back corner near the kitchen, grabbed my son a high chair, and told us our server would be right with us. I kept him busy with the crayons and kiddie menu that were provided for as long as I could, but anybody with young children understands that this only lasts for so long. 5 minutes goes by... 7... 10.. and after 12 minutes of sitting with my son, who's noisy enough as it is so it's not like the server wouldn't have noticed us, without being approached by any staff member, we went to the hostess stand to let them know what was going on. She stood there and stared at me.... At that point, we were both starving so I said we were just going to get a carry out instead. She rudely 'apologized' and pointed us over to the bar. No manager came over to speak with us. We ordered a carryout with the bartender who seemed less then pleased to help us and while waiting were approached by another member of the waitstaff who tried to ""explain"" what had happened and why we were left to sit there. Thanks but no thanks. Because I do the same exact job as you do, I find these excuses absurd as I would never allow a guest to have such a horrid experience without some attempt at making it right. We waited 25+ minutes for a kids Mac and cheese and the sizzling chicken and shrimp (which were cold/way over cooked/bland/disgusting/etc..)

23,Heather J.,"Concord, NH",0,20,196.0,2.0,2016-04-30,"Pick another spot.  I nearly gave just one star, but I like to differentiate the bad from the truly horrible. We arrived shortly after 2 pm, so the restaurant was not busy. The hostess was far from welcoming, though nothing in particular was unpleasant. The floors were grossly sticky; shoes did not leave the ground easily and we could hear everyone walk.  Our waiter was pleasant, albeit sluggish at best. When our table of four ordered drinks, I ordered a tea and a water. My tea came out with the others, but we had to hail him ten minutes later so I could get my water. He responded with a clearly annoyed, ""I'm getting it. Gimme a second."" That interaction was the tone for our entire meal.  Two drinks on our table were refreshed during the hour and a half we were there when it would have been appropriate for six to ten refreshes tablewide. He was borderline ignoring us despite that we were his only table for at least half an hour. Our orders consisted of salads, a sandwich, and a sizzler. Forty minutes later, the sizzler came out; it arrived with a promise of the others on the way out. When asked 10 minutes later, the waiter said the other dishes were on the way out.  Another 10 minutes passed before the other dishes arrived. Also, two of the orders were wrong: a salad came without chicken and an extra side nobody would eat arrived with the entree. (Side note: the mashed potatoes are bland at best - but they were well plated. Nobody was impressed with any of the food, meaning everything was between mediocre and decent [2-3.5 on a 5-point scale].)

Tracey informed us that TGI Fridays doesn't normally accommodate parties/groups over eight (8) persons, although we previously informed the host there were over 15 persons in our party before we were seated. (Our AFRICAN AMERICAN family group at the time consisted of 16-two tables of 8. We further informed them that other family members were in the parking lot and more family members were coming). We knew this wasn't true because we had celebrated a birthday with a large group over 8 at that same Fridays location a couple of years prior. My family members spoke with Tracey for approximately 30 minutes trying to understand the problem/issue. Finally, although Tracey ultimately decided to ""accommodate"" us, the service was horrible: Our orders were not immediately taken; the servers, Jessie and Casey, were very sarcastic and rude, although they tried to feign good service at the end to get tips; many of our family members had to wait approximately an hour to be served appetizers, and then later, entrees; we were met with nasty attitudes when we made requests/asked for the ""Birthday Song;"" and were made to feel very disregarded and unwelcome. The restaurant was not crowded at all and many of the tables were empty. (We have photos). Our experience was very negative, and it's unfair that our family group-28 people-spent hundreds of dollars on that occasion, but was treated/serviced so poorly because of our race. Despite how unprofessionally we were treated, we remained polite and respectful to the manager, Tracey, and the servers, Jessie and Casey. We did not leave Fridays until after 8 p.m. because of the delayed/late service.  It was a rather unfortunate experience, and it's only fitting that such conduct be addressed. I'm sure TGI Fridays will conclude that the experience was A LOT worse than what I'm able to convey in limited characters.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sterling-heights?start=20,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.028,2.0

I was thinking in my head maybe these people who reviewed this place were just unlucky. It was my first time going to this place. I went on a Sunday with a couple of my buddies. We ordered burgers and fries and mozzarella sticks at the appetizer. The mozzarella sticks on the menu said 5 dollars. So when we got our burgers, they tasted bland af. We had to force ourselves to eat the burger because it wasn't good. I couldn't even finish my burger because it tasted awful. And I didn't even want to take a to go box because it wasn't even worth taking home. I wouldn't even serve this food to homeless people. So when we got our bill I looked at the receipt and it said 7.99 for the mozzarella sticks. I was confused because I thought I told the waitress I wanted the 5 dollar mozzarella sticks that was pictured on the menu and the one that I was clearly pointing at when I ordered. The waitress said there was two options the full one is 7.99 and the half one is 5.00. I'm like wait she didn't even tell us there was two options. The waitress just assumed we wanted the full mozzarella sticks and basically overcharged us and made no apologizes afterwards. I had no problem paying for it but I just want to know what I'm paying for. Overall the food was HORRIBLE! and the waitress provided bad service.

I have never experienced service that bad.  We walked in, the host mumbled something underneath his breath and started walking - we were not sure whether he said to follow him or what....... AWKWARD. Anyway, upon being seated - a girl approached us, asking if we were ready. We said we needed a few minutes, she didn't let us finish our sentence and she was already walking away. My drink was supposed to be a lemonade slush.... it was melted. We ordered a boneless wing appetizer and two dinner entrees. About half hour went by, she brought us our appetizer and said ""your food will be up shortly"" ; I said ""can I please get some more water"" ........ WE NEVER SAW HER AGAIN. Another 40 minutes went by. No staff was anywhere to be found. Another guest at the restaurant walked up her own check, then walked back to her seat, then walked up to get her change. We saw a waitress (not ours) and after saying ""excuse me"" 4x- she finally looked up at us - I asked ""do you guys have a manager around"" she said ""what's the problem"" .... I said ""well we've been waiting for our food for like 1 1/2 now ... she yelled something into the back of the kitchen and we never saw her again. A manager never came. We waited about 10 more minutes and at that point got up and tried to find a manager, a waiter, anybody .... and realized everyone (manager included) was standing in the kitchen.

No"" and she went to the kitchen, the other bartender then comes over, sets down beverage napkins says ""are y'all even 21?

Visited for lunch on early Sunday afternoon and the place was dead. Our server oddly apologized for it being so busy and he'd be back as soon as he could... I thought he was joking at first, but it was apparent that he couldn't handle more than a table or two at a time. We waited about 30 minutes for our drinks and about another 30 minutes for our food. When asked about a separate drink order, he sent the manager over for some reason and he comped our drink, so at least there's that. Overall, we waited over an hour on a dead Sunday for microwaved food and old beer. Never again will I go to this, or any other Fridays location.

Also, FYI if you want to send a complaint to corporate it is best to google the number. Otherwise, if you ask for the corporate number managers at this location are instructed to give you the number of their district manager that won't do anything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sterling-heights,1.08,1.08,1.08,,1.08
5,Brian R.,"Keego Harbor, MI",0,5,,1.0,2017-12-23,Restaurant was almost empty had to wait 10 mins to get seated watched 2 other couples walk out.  Placed our order for a Cobb salad and fish and chips.  15 mins later waitress came out and told they where out of fish at this point we got up and left.  Would have left no stars if that was possible,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sterling-heights,1.04,1.04,1.04,,1.04
