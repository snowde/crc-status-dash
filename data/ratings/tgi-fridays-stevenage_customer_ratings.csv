0,Kam K.,"Stevenage, United Kingdom",1,15,11,1.0,2016-06-14,"We were so excited when TGIF opened in Stevenage that we could not wait to pay the place a visit. Unfortunately, it was a very disappointing experience. We paid a lot and weren't satisfied. We felt it would have been a better experience if we had gone to KFC instead. Because of my allergies, the staff had to get the manager to take our orders. One of the most unenthusiastic and disinterested manager I have ever interacted with. He was so sluggish. He forgot to get the allergens' guide when he came over to take the order, so had to return to get it and he took his own sweet time to return. I should mention that the staff was friendly and were happy to serve. Even though the restaurant wasn't busy, the food took forever to come out.  We ordered JD Cajun battered shrimp, Nachos, JD chicken and shrimp grill with mash and seasonal vegetables and JD duck salad. The food was average. The mash was dry as though it was lying outside on the plate for hours. The veg was cold and the chicken breast was dry and was also the tiniest piece.  I have eaten at other branches of TGIF within the UK and also internationally, and have loved every bit of it. Hence will be giving TGIF Stevenage another chance before I rule them out completely.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stevenage,,,,,
