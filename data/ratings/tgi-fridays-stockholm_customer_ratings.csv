16,Linda K.,"Stockholm, Sweden",96,237,79.0,4.0,2012-05-21,"I'm gonna start by saying that even though I live in the US for five years now (and counting), I do enjoy going to Friday's when I'm home. One might ask why, here is my answer. There is NO Friday's on Hawaii!! There used to be one, but they closed. Instead they have the same type of chain called Chili's which can basically give you the same  kind of food and drinks for the same prices. But enough about that.  Friday's in Kungstradgarden brings back memories of when I was about to graduate high school (gymnasiet) and we decided to have our graduation party at Fridays. All the graduates showed up and I have a hard time remembering what happened so it must have been a great time.  This was before they remodeled the place, and somehow I think I like that layout better. I do however enjoy the ""new"" seating area outside, but it's always full so be prepared to wait. I have never had a bad experience with the people working there, I think they are attentive and alert when it comes to taking orders and bringing food out. There has been times when they have been slow in coming to our table after we finished our meals and wanted to pay, but it's no biggie.  Friday will always hold a special place in my heart, and I will always return at least once whenever I'm in Sweden.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm,,,,,
15,Diana G.,"San Francisco, CA",123,33,2.0,4.0,2013-06-20,"This is perfect for a warm summer day/night. Their outside seating area is remodeled I think since I was there last, and it's really cool. They play music and waiters run around doing a good job (for being Sweden). I was here a few days ago (middle of June) on a really hot summer day, and had one of their mojito shakers. It is a generous shaker! The price isn't that high either for the portions they serve you.  I have eaten here once before, but I feel like this is a place to go for the drinks rather than eating.The other restaurant located a few blocks away at Stureplan is much bigger and nicer for sitting inside, so it may be better for winter time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm,,,,,
17,Cacilie K.,"Gamla stan, Stockholm, Sweden",17,59,31.0,3.0,2014-01-30,"Fast service with a smile.  If you are looking for mediocre tasting American food that won't break the bank in Stockholm, this is the place.  You will get what you see on the menu, no more, no less.  It does get busy around dinner time so you might expect a wait unless you have a reservation or want to sit outside I the cold... People do that, they have air heaters, and blankets.  I personally prefer sitting indoors, but if you don't mind, they have plenty of seating available out there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm,,,,,
13,Simon H.,"Stockholm, Sweden",12,144,504.0,4.0,2014-04-21,"T.G.I. Friday's is an international restaurant chain with a concept. To me, it's not very charming with its dress coded teenage staff and menu that looks like an ad flyer. But I think T.G.I. Friday's reputation is worse than it deserves. Yes, the music is way too generic-radio-friendly-American and way too loud - and yes, it's a big chain so maybe the chefs don't have as much of a personal reputation to defend. But the burgers are good, the fries are always crispy and the Jack Daniel's ribs (not the baby back ribs) are heavenly! I'd place it somewhere between Jensen's and an upscale meat restaurant, in terms of both likability and quality of the food. Also, their location - right at the edge of Kungsträdgården - is wonderful. Maybe the four stars are not super strong, but it's closer to four than three in my book. I come here about once a month when I want to treat myself with a classier lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm,,,,,
14,laura a.,"Austin, TX",28,17,13.0,5.0,2014-06-22,Great location for older children because you can watch them run around the fountain. Family accessible. Great service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm,,,,,
7,Miss M.,"Stockholm, Sweden",61,174,2037.0,3.0,2014-10-24,"I feel a bit silly going into Fridays while in a foreign country. I feel like i'm encouraging bad cliques like ""Americans only eat at crappy hamburger places"" or something.  However, I can't deny there is a lot of truth to the fact that we do consume a lot of hamburgers! ;) Oh well! =P As far as TGIF's food is concerned, the quality and taste ranges from average to ""just ok"" and ""pretty good"" in my opinion. Comparatively, I think the food quality and customer service standards are very similar at the restaurants in the states. It's nice to come here if I want to be reminded a little bit of home. Though, I can't say it's my favorite place to eat or a high quality dining establishment. I still think it's a highly enjoyable place to grab a casual meal or drink! On another note, I was pleasantly surprised by our wonderful and helpful waitress last night. She was very quick and efficient. She also noticed our soda glasses were low and sent over free refills without us having to ask! Love that! TIP: Go on someones birthday and tell the waiter that it's that person's birthday in secret! They will get a birthday singing to and a free desert! =) TIP: They have a sunday - thursday deal of 199kr for a 2 course meal and 258kr for a three course meal. The portions are big though, so plan on taking a ""doggie bag"" home... American style. HA!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm,,,,,
10,Andreas F.,"Stockholm, Sweden",27,379,87.0,4.0,2015-05-04,"Went here due to recommendations from a friend of their new refreshed menu. And it all began with great service, taking care of our show up in a great manner. Although it was an early crowded summer day, they got us seated on the front row at the patio with the sunshine smiling in our faces. The updated menu gives you a great variety and it actually takes quite a while to go through it. They have some very interesting dishes, both healthy and more unhealthy ones. Pricing is fair and most ppl can probably survive without swiping several different credit cards. The concept is very like the american styled Chilis or Apple bees which both gives you a great amount of food for your bucks. Although that, you shouldnt go here expecting a high class venue. But its a fun, casual and premium located restaurant, which will settle even the most uneven couple over a dinner!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm,,,,,
11,Thomas S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,27,8.0,1.0,2015-08-25,A hateful place with overpriced slop they fraudulently try to pass off as food. They try to pimp the American spirit but they haven't got a clue what actually makes America great - democracy and free speech.. Boycott TGI!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm,,,,,
12,Jim D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",102,469,185.0,3.0,2015-10-11,If you're there on a Friday or Saturday night you better be prepared for wait we had to order three times because every time they were out of what we wanted the food was pretty good try the ribeye steak and all so I would suggest the Caesar salad with chicken not bad no anchovies if you're looking for them and they prices are pretty decent however it is corralled itThe European version is somewhat different than the American but basically it's the same English is the first language then Swedish the staff is very very friendly,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm,,,,,
2,Marqus R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1384,3324,13873.0,3.0,2015-11-08,"So what is this? I'm in Stockholm but end up at a TGIF restaurant? On that count I best explain. It was late at night, I was hungry, and this seemed to be the only place open. However, I'm glad I did end up here as I was in for a rather good time. I've been to any number of TGIF restaurants in the United States and initially thought this one would be much the same, but it wasn't. To my delight it was much better. First off, the place was packed with a lot of fun people. It had one of the most joyful crowds I've been in. Though I had to wait nearly an hour in order to get an inside table. The outside may be OK for Swedes but was way too cold for this Floridian. The service was good, everyone spoke English and I have to say that their spoken English was superior in every way, perfect grammar, perfect American English, better than I've ever heard from any of my TGIF services in America; also far more mannerly, cultured and polite.  I ordered a steak and a beer. The presentation of my steak was nothing to look at or write home about, but the taste of it along with the taste of the side dishes, better in flavor than I've gotten at any TGIF in the United States. It was also done perfectly as ordered. Hence for me, in my book this is one TGIF that rates a solid Three Stars Plus, as well as one to which I wouldn't hesitate to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm,,,,,
6,Orisha G.,"Solna, Sweden",5,4,1.0,2.0,2016-02-14,"Services was excellent. Food was not, cold steak and mash potatoes. My daughter had to wait 10 mins to receive her meal after the rest of the family received theirs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm,,,,,
8,Lavender L.,"Arlington, VA",4,231,,3.0,2016-05-18,"Good lunch specials at 10 euro a person including a drink. I got a lemon basil salad. It was lemony with dry chicken. The boys got the classic Jack Daniel burgers which were good, except for the pickles.  Not your typical dills from the US. The kids burger was bland and dry. The fries were good, as were the free refills. Nice staff and location. Too pricey for dinner though, so go before 2pm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm,,,,,
9,Kim D.,"Hollis, NY",79,20,,3.0,2016-06-05,"Jack Daniels glazed baby back ribs. Very sweet sauce, but very tasty still. Beware of the food coma about to commence though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm,,,,,
5,Chocoolate I.,"San Francisco, CA",0,468,752.0,4.0,2016-09-26,I love checking out different TGI Fridays and this one is terrific. Consider sitting at the bar to avoid the wait where you can feel like you are in the center of mini Stockholm. The bartenders were especially real characters and especially friendly and the restaurant was alive. I had wine and chicken wings. Fridays in known for wings and this one did not disappoint. The wings were piping hot and excellent. There is plenty of outside seating and the long pool on one side is cool for people watching.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm,,,,,
4,John P.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",28,1,,1.0,2017-06-03,"Took 20 minutes to seat, even with open tables. Took another half hour until our waiter came to our table. One hour more until we were served our milkshakes. At one point our server stopped his shift and just left. After a little over two hours, we asked another server if they could get him. She said she could take our payment. Even after explaining we had been there for two hours and only ordered drinks, no compensation was given.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm,,,,,

1,Sanna F.,"Hamburg, Germany",0,3,1.0,1.0,2017-10-04,"Really bad service. The waiter recognized us after a few long minutes standing at the door (and he wanted to go to a table, not coming to us especially), took us to a table und gave us swedish menus. We were talking english to him.  After sit down nobody came. Like literally nobody was even in the room, except the bartender.  We were leaving after 15 minutes.  We didn't want to wait for the food this long as it takes to get our orders. Maybe longer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm,,,,,
