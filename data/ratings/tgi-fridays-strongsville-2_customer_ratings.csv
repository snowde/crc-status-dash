15,Cheryl J.,"Strongsville, OH",54,120,91.0,3.0,2012-11-07,Tried the black bean burger here and I was very impressed! It has caramelized onions and avocado which really sealed the deal for me! I suggest it for any vegetarians!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-strongsville-2,,,,,
13,Mike T.,"Cleveland, OH",35,116,34.0,2.0,2014-01-30,"We were actually here two times in the past three weeks. Why? Laziness is the probable answer. But in reality, the steak I had was ok and the Mojito was better than I've had in other places. Best thing I can say is that it is better than Applebee's or Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-strongsville-2,,,,,
18,Marie B.,"Cleveland, OH",0,3,,1.0,2014-03-08,Well me and my husband went here for lunch.  The food and service was terrible.  It wasn't crowed and we waited 40 mins for our food to come out.  When the food did come out it looked gross.  We both ordered a burger and fries.  The burger was nothing but grease.  This place is to expensive for the type of food they serve.  We will never go back.  The burger was $12 bucks it was definitely not worth it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-strongsville-2,,,,,
11,Josh Z.,"Morrisville, NC",3,14,4.0,1.0,2014-05-11,"Tried one of their ""famous"" burger stacks, asked for medium got a burnt to a crisp burger the size of a McDonald's quarter pounder all for 3x the cost. Small portions for way too high prices. Floors were sticky menus were sticky nothing looked particularly clean. Service was adequate. Overall would not recommend and I will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-strongsville-2,,,,,
8,Mark R.,"COLUMBIA STA, OH",24,344,177.0,2.0,2014-05-12,"This was only a late dinner stop due to other places being closed. TGIF. Should be fairly consistent, because they prefab the seasonings and sauces. But somehow it's a gamble ordering. I have never liked strongsville location and don't have good recommendations.  I always get Cajun shrimp and pasta. Pretty idiot proof dish. The sauce is prefab and pasta, well how tough is boiling water and waiting 8-10 minutes. Their pick two ($15.99) deal want much of deal. The spinach dip was almost lacking any trace of cream. If you order salmon that isn't glazed you are making a big mistake here. Unless you lack tastebuds, there is little, to no flavor here. The portions were small. The parmesan steak fries were lacking real cheeses or again flavor.  The server was actually very friendly and manager did stop by to ask about food. She was concerned about ok and decent describing the meals. Not enough to Off set food. The food rates a 1 1/2 star but service have a little better rating.   There are better choices in strongsville.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-strongsville-2,,,,,
10,Mark M.,"Valley City, OH",3,347,1.0,1.0,2014-08-02,One of the worst restaurant chains.  Customer relations is a joke.  The food is just so-so and it seams that is owned by Jack Daniels since half the menu has it smothered with it.  Selection can be much better and same at all locations..  Very loud.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-strongsville-2,,,,,
16,Sharon M.,"Brunswick, OH",1,7,,2.0,2014-09-18,"I've been there often and have seen a decline in the past couple of years. The food is very greasy and fatty and the restaurant seems to be less clean with every visit. There is a very unpleasant smell that seems to concentrate in the bar area. As another reviewer indicated, the floors and the menus are sticky.  The staff is very nice though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-strongsville-2,,,,,
14,Mike M.,"Berea, OH",1,45,,4.0,2015-03-16,"We went there on sunday, and ordered food with the kids. We had such a great experience. My youngest wanted mac n cheese, Kraft style. when it came out it wasnt what he expected, so he didnt eat it. But they came through with more fries and fruit. I was really impressed. We love this place. Its gotten a little expensive, but the food and service are top notch. I love the burgers there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-strongsville-2,,,,,
0,Dawn W.,"Euclid, OH",0,21,20.0,4.0,2015-06-26,"Place was very busy.  There were 5 of us.  Ordered the 2 of the $5 appetizers, boneless wings and the flatbread. Both were delicious.  The complimentary chips and salsa was nice.  Ordered the ribs, Cajun shrimp and chicken, hibachi chicken and the Parmesan chicken.  All was great. Attentive waitress!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-strongsville-2,,,,,
12,Liz W.,"Strongsville, OH",5,32,2.0,5.0,2015-08-31,"Looking over these reviews I am so surprised at so much negativity. Besides the amazing appetizers, I absolutely love their ribs, burgers, and salmon! The french onion soup is also a must have. Seriously, besides maybe boneyard, I haven't been able to find ribs that I enjoy more anywhere else. The staff is great and so friendly. Catie is one of the best bartenders and servers there. She is so sweet and always so accommodating. We have never had a bad experience here! Make sure you get a seat when they do the bar tending competitions! It's very entertaining!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-strongsville-2,,,,,
9,K R.,"Middleburg Heights, OH",0,7,,1.0,2015-09-11,Haven't been here in a few years so wife and I decided to go for change of pace.  Big mistake. Way overpriced for terribly average food and small portions.  Server was trying too hard to be nice but otherwise service was fine.   I know most of these type of chains are overpriced for the quality and quantity but TGIFridays has definitely dropped to the bottom of that list.  Definitely will not eat here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-strongsville-2,,,,,
7,Kevin K.,"Brecksville, OH",4,6,8.0,4.0,2016-02-27,I think this place isn't given enough respect. Staff is great and food is what you'd expect. Atmosphere is great and I'll be back for sure.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-strongsville-2,,,,,
4,Kevin D.,"Medina, OH",2,18,7.0,4.0,2016-07-15,"A late night stop around 11:30 and the food is still as well cooked and presented as if it were in the middle of the day. I had the two pieces of grilled chicken with Jack Daniels, broccoli, and sweet potato fries. The broccoli was crunchy to the bite and the sweet potato fries were well seasoned. The grilled chicken looked wonderful and it was pretty juicy on the inside as well. The Jack Daniels sauce tied the whole meal together and was a good size meal as well. The waitress was also friendly and quick. Good place to come if you want some late night good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-strongsville-2,,,,,
3,Jayme K.,"Cleveland, OH",31,84,21.0,1.0,2016-08-18,"Haven't been to a Friday's in a long time -Came in for a quick Dinner after golf and sat at the Bar.... The Bar was so sticky and flies were flying around all the drinks and around the bar. Bartender was un-attentive and didn't seem to know what was going on. We debated about leaving but thought we'd give it a try since we were just ordering soup, Cesar salad, and the soft pretzel with cheese appetizer. The soft pretzels with cheese was the best thing we had and was surprising good, The French onion soup was so salty you could barley sip it and the cheese on top was barley melted, The Cesar Salad was very fishy, there about 9 pieces of lettuce, and no bread stick that was listed on the menu...what a bummer!  Definitely a disappointment and wouldn't recommend eating here- Save your money!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-strongsville-2,,,,,
2,Kathryn S.,"Greenwood, IN",89,6,1.0,1.0,2017-01-10,"So disappointed. Possibly the slowest service I've ever received. Placed order for our entire meal immediately. Forty five minutes later, no refills. No food. When it finally arrived, order was wrong. It wasn't even busy so there's no excuse.  In general, TGI Friday's is always a good experience. This location just seems to suck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-strongsville-2,,,,,
6,Melodie W.,"Olmsted Falls, OH",2,10,1.0,3.0,2017-02-23,My husband and I ate here last night. He had one of the burgers. I had the ribs. My husband said that the burger was dry and the condiments was on one side making the burger very sloppy. The fries were over cooked. My ribs were perfect. Fall off the bone great. The barbecue sauce was mild. Which is the way I like it. The coleslaw was dry. And my fries were also over cooked. The music was loud and it was hard to hear what my husband was saying. We were there around five pm. The service was ok. We had to ask for extra napkins and wipes for my fingers. This was not our first time there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-strongsville-2,,,,,
5,Cara M.,"Berea, OH",17,3,,1.0,2017-03-05,"We used to go to Fridays fairly often several years ago.  We started having really bad service the last few times we went.  We decided to take a break and started going to other places.  After 2 years , we decided last night to go to the strongsville location because we got gift cards for their.  When we arrived, it was packed (a positive sign that it may have improved).  I walked up to host to put in my name and was completely ignored.  Others walked up and he was taking names of others but in no particular order!!!!  Once we were seated, waiter came by right away and took our drink orders.  Took about 15 min for him to come back with drinks and take our order!  Food came out in decent time.  However, waiter never came back to see if we needed refills or to see how our food was!!!! Also, by the time we were leaving the wait was still about an hour.  Although, there had to have been at least 5-6 empty tables with no one ever being seated!!!!There turnaround time is horrid!!!! Never once saw a mgr when their!!! Perfect example of improper training of employees!!!! The mgr should been out and about making sure all was going as it should and getting the turnaround of customers in/out running like it should!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-strongsville-2,,,,,
1,Beverly B.,"Strongsville, OH",17,7,,1.0,2017-11-21,Want to know why your dining room is empty at lunch time?  It's because your food isn't any good!  French fries should be served hot so should soup.   The server was the only saving grace.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-strongsville-2,,,,,
