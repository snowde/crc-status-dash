6,Mindaugas S.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",28,283,613.0,3.0,2014-03-03,"I have never been in USA and don't think I'll be going, if I end up there. It's an OK place, but not for me particularly. Despite that, this restaurant is great for parties and especially kids parties. There's nothing too serious in the menu. Half of menu is ""Jack Daniels branded"", sort of... Why did I go there? Because I tried one dish in Riga airport's TGI Friday's and loved it. So said to myself I'll try find it in Ireland, but no luck - different menu. Go there to have kids party, should have great fun.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-swords,,,,,
4,Phil D.,"Donaghmede, Republic of Ireland",11,41,11.0,1.0,2014-05-12,"My second time here.  First time was disappointed with the ribs - greasy & flavourless. Decided to give it a second chance with family.  The Sesame Jack Daniels chicken strips are the best thing they do. Unfortunately nobody finished their food.  everyone thought it was only OK.  My caramel apple pie was a flavourless much.  No texture, no flavour, just not good. Tonight I've been really ill, so I'm guessing the chicken strips were to blame. Won't be visiting again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-swords,,,,,
7,W B.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",0,19,,2.0,2015-04-11,"Food overall was bland.  €25 steak simply flavourless, a huge disappointment. The premises was in need of a cleaning. Cutlery was that flimsily thin cheap stuff. The only redeeming quality was that the waiter was very attentive. Hugely doubtful we'll return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-swords,,,,,
3,Chris C.,"Taunusstein, Germany",71,121,66.0,3.0,2015-04-15,"We wanted dinner the night before we left Dublin and this place was close to our hotel. Being familiar with the chain in the USA we figured ""why not?"" We actually enjoyed our visit, beer and dinner much better than the TGI Fridays in the USA because it wasn't LOUD and boisterous inside.  The service was prompt, quick and friendly. The only ""issue"" would be the marked up prices here due to its vicinity of Dublin Airport. It seemed the prices were MUCH higher than what we have experienced in the past and when you conver the $ to Euro, it was definitely way more expensive than a stateside TGIF.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-swords,,,,,
0,Kristen S.,"Chandler, AZ",8,28,14.0,4.0,2015-07-17,"I'm actually pretty surprised at the low reviews that everyone else has given. I've eaten at this restaurant at least a dozen times since I moved to the area and don't share any of the same complaints as the others. The sesame jack chicken strips are amazing. The boneless bites are amazing. The beef nachos, the pork ribs, the burgers, the sizzling chicken, the fajitas, the sweet potato fries - they're all amazing. I've only tried one thing in the menu I didn't like and that was the Cajun chicken penne, which I thought was flavourless. Ok, ok so the prices are marked up compared to the U.S., but that's pretty much Dublin in a nutshell. It's certainly not specific to TGIFRIDAYS. Overall, it's been a positive experience 90% of the time with lack of attentiveness being my #1 complaint when the restaurant is completely full. Just go at non-peak times and you're sorted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-swords,,,,,

2,Mark R.,"Lakeville, MN",88,148,45.0,1.0,2016-08-18,"In starting this review, I'll point a fact that I'm not a fan of TGIFridays in Minnesota. I happily worked for two different ones in Memphis, TN a gazillion years ago. In MN, the few occasions we tried TGIF absolutely sucked and I vowed never to go in another one again unless under duress or someone else was buying the drinks all night. 2016, flying out of Dublin with the family, and this TGIF is close to the hotel. (eyes rolling) I agreed to Fridays. Note: We looked in towns nearby, however the lines were long and the prices a bit high for what we wanted to eat.  So in we go, eventually greeted, and we wait for a table in a restaurant that wasn't busy. So to the table, we wait. Gazing at the menu, I'm a little surprised by the price markup. Granted, we are near the airport. Perhaps the locals get different menus. The wifi didn't work, so now I'm a little more annoyed. I can't check into Yelp! Server shows up, seems like she could give a rats ass one way or another about anything. Considering you don't have to tip in Ireland, I'm not bothered by that.  Ordering; just so you know, we are a family with two gluten and dairy free members. We were having some difficulty with the menu. The server now seemingly annoyed that we weren't ready for her to take our order. I request a gluten free menu and the wonderful gent that returned looked and seemed embarrassed by what was offered as a menu. It was a allergen list of what allergens were in the menu items. Not specific menu items by name, just generic terms of what they serve. FOR FUCKS SAKE!!! Everything had a wheat symbol with exception of the fish. Does the hamburger meat contain wheat, just the bun, or both? I'm sure I'll never know now.  Note: We were able to find gluten free items in a pub out in the sticks days earlier. You're telling me a ""international"" restaurant like TGIFridays can't produce a gluten free anything. Not even a bun from the freezer? Ireland, like most of northern Europe I presume (and hope) is extremely progressive with its gluten free offerings. So that was enough. We left and went to the restaurant next door, Hogs & Heifers. Stellar review of that place coming soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-swords,,,,,
1,Gary F.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",30,53,238.0,2.0,2016-08-23,I wasnt too impressed altho the decor was total american wood and americana the food let it down. The starter was greasy. The speed was a long wait. The staff where very good. The main wasnt well presented the plate over shadowed the burger .the crispy onions overloaded the bun which was soggy with grease and the strawberry daqueri was very bad and looked like it came out of a lidl pre prepared bag . The fries where dry and not very appealing. The dessert was also very bad cream wasnt fresh and the whole meal itself left me very disatisfied and i was honestly still hungry after it. Was the same experience as hogs and heifers very american feel but not american belly buster. Short review as it was a short handed place to be,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-swords,,,,,
