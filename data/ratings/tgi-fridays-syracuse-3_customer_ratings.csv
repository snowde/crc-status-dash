40,Dave S.,"Syracuse, NY",64,70,176.0,3.0,2013-09-05,"Went for dinner tonight with my girlfriend. First walking through the door. This place is unlike any tgi Fridays I've ever been too. A very modern and sleek design in comparison to others. Wait staff was very friendly and was seated quickly. As for the food. That's where the problem laid for me. I ordered the whiskey ribeye with shrimp scampi. Two sides tomato mozzarella salad and parmesan ""steak fries"". The steak was cooked properly (ordered mid rare)but wasn't exactly what I'd call a ribeye. Poorly seasoned. No marble. Sort of blah and kind of tough, which I found odd given it wasn't cooked to death, the shrimp were poorly cleaned and over cooked to the point where it was tough to eat. The mozz salad had no seasoning and was far too oniony for my liking. The ""steak fries"" were actually pretty tasty. Although, the quotes are because they are actually potato wedges. And the whole plate was swimming in a pool of grease. Literally my steak probably could have been floating there was so much oil on the plate. And the bruschetta-esque topping on the shrimp, pretty much coated the whole plate. It was sloppy and underwhelming for a 22$ meal. Though it could have just been an off night. Waitress (Felicia, I believe she said her name was) was very attentive and freshened up drinks and took plates without even being prompted. For now it's 3 stars for me. But given the experience. I would try it again, maybe the food would be better a second time around. All in all. Not wow. But not awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3?start=60,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003

If you enjoy go-cart racing & loud music, this is your place. Staff was fine; they didn't set the location up, so I can't blame them. The food wasn't anything special, even by my low chain-restaurant standards. Biggest disappointment was the ""Triple Decker Reuben"" in which TGI Fridays has apparently lost all connection to it's NYC roots. I couldn't find the sauerkraut anywhere on it and the six filaments I thought might be the sauerkraut must have been caramelized onion.  The sandwich should have been billed as ""Corned Beef and Cheese"" because I couldn't locate any of the other elements of a Reuben.

The bartender was not the least bit friendly, never smiled and seemed to be annoyed that she was waiting on us. Not a huge deal as everyone has an off day and I was there for the company of my friend anyway. On the other hand, the food was less than desirable. I've always been a fan of pretty much everything at TGIFridays. I think they have one of the most well rounded and freshest tasting menus as far as chain restaurants go. My potato skins were cold and over cooked. There was not any soft potato left to them. Last I knew they also used shredded cheese on them. These had a large thick piece of what looked to be cheese cut from a brick just sitting in the middle barely melted. They were not anything like what I have eaten there in the past. Ordinarily I probably would have mentioned it to the person serving me but it was quite a while before she came to check on us and as I mentioned her attitude was poor to begin with. I'm sure some time in the future I will be back.

Both were good sized drinks and definitely weren't weak. We enjoyed our first round of drinks so we decided to grab some appetizers and another round, which I'm glad we did. I thought the potato skins were cooked perfectly, nice and crispy. Our friends ordered their appetizers at the same time as us, but the woman who brought food out only brought ours, and as soon as the bartender waiting on us noticed they hadn't received theirs at the same time, she was quick to go back and grab them.

To kill time we decided to watch a movie and ended up in this mall on a Sunday night. Everything was closed except for the movie theater and TGIF. I desperately needed coffee to stay awake but unfortunately the concession stalls at the movie theater had a broken coffee machine.  We decided to buy coffee from TGIF. We went in and asked the host if they had coffee to go. He went in to check with his manager. The manager came out and asked us if we just wanted coffee to go and nothing else. We said ""Yes!"". He said are you sure? ""Coffee here is fairly expensive, you'd rather get it at the movie theater if that is all you need"" and I said ""Yes, but their coffee machines are broken"" (I really needed that coffee to stay awake). He looked at me and understood. Went in got us two coffee's to go. When I asked him how much I owed him, he said ""these are on me"". It was the sweetest gesture from no where.

59,Brian C.,"Venice, FL",0,21,4.0,1.0,2014-09-27,"Stopped at Fridays on a Friday evening. First sat at the bar, there were 3 bartenders at the far end. The bar was not busy yet and all 3 bartenders just stood there without waiting on me. Finally I got up and went to a hostess and requested a table since I was waiting for some friends to show up. I waited over 15 minutes at the table before anyone came to see me. Again the restaurant was not yet busy.  After my friends arrived, they had to wait an extended period of time before anyone came to take their order. After we finally placed our order for some drinks , it was over another 25 minutes before we received them. The waitress blamed it on training being done at the bar. You would think this would not be done on a Friday evening. We were going to eat here but were so disgusted we got up and left. Ended up going to the Cheesecake Factory where we were promptly waited on. Also had a great dinner there.  The lack of service and attention at TGIFridays would make me hesitate to ever come back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3?start=40,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006

39,Kat N.,"North Port, FL",92,29,27.0,2.0,2014-12-15,"We are in Syracuse on business, and based on a recommendation from someone we met, decided to check out Destiny mall and eat at Friday's. I couldn't regret the decision more. First, the young ladies working hostess counter, after greeting us proceeded to bash co-workers in front of us, complaining about menus not being returned or the bar answering their calls. They, within earshot of us, referred to their peers as ""crack heads."" Then when we were finally seated we were greeted by our very nice server, but had to wait 20 minutes for a watered down drink order. After tasting the drinks, 2 of the orders were sent back as they tasted like water. When one of our party stepped up to the bar to ask on an ETA on the remake, she was spoken to rudely by the bartender. It took over 45 minutes after we were seated to receive our meals. Realizing we were frustrated, our server asked her manager to come talk to us. He offered a discount on our meals for our extensive wait and apologized. The meal orders were wrong as well, but we were so hungry and tired of waiting that we just ate what we had. When our checks arrived, two of them were wrong and needed further correction. At that point another manager came to apologize, assuming she knew the story when she didn't. She was in training, and the manager who had promised the discounts didn't bother to finish handling the situation. In fact, when he saw us, he ducked his head and avoided us. The manager in training apologized and kept reiterating that this was not the norm & the goal was a 10. Although she tried, the situation was already unmanageable and should never have been handed off by the manager on duty. Needless to say, if the server hadn't shown much care, this review would be a 1 and I'll never be returning to this particular Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3?start=20,2.9840000000000004,2.9840000000000004,2.9840000000000004,2.9840000000000004,2.9840000000000004

The waitress couldn't understand my directions to have my appetizer (sliders) to be put on a dinner plate with broccoli on the side and come out with the rest of my parties entree. She told me it was impossible to have that be done, but then I could have my sliders and broccoli on two separate plates come out with the entree. That did not happen, my sliders came out as an appetizer with the other appetizers and when everybody's entree came out my ONE big piece of broccoli came out. I looked foolish with just one big piece of broccoli in a soup bowl while everyone else had what they ordered.

Most days they have some sort of appetizer special (for example Sundays are half priced apps). They also have 2 for 1 well drinks, long island ice teas, and margaritas every day in addition to whatever other daily drink special. I stick with well drinks, as usually their margaritas and long islands are too sweet for me. I find their food pretty good overall, but it isn't anything special. I do love their boneless wings, both the buffalo flavored and the BBQ flavored, and their flatbreads are tasty. I find their potato skins to be greasy sometimes, and their burgers are hit or miss. We did send our food back once because our boneless wings had virtually no sauce to be found on them. Our bartender got it taken care of quickly and with a smile and apology, which we appreciated.  We only ever sit at the bar, and service has been consistent. The bartenders are friendly and attentive, and if we ever need something it isn't difficult to get someone's attention.

57,Shelley B.,"Gloversville, NY",29,2,,4.0,2015-06-03,"I liked the ambiance of this restaurant and that they accepted my phone coupon for reward points because I didn't print it off on paper like I usually do. They took $8 off our bill and made the experience a pleasant one. I wanted to visit Margaritaville in the Destiny USA mall but that didn't pan out so my second choice was my old time favorite, TGI Fridays. We got seated right away and serviced right away. The hostess was a little strange acting but pleasant enough. Our waitress was friendly as well and assisted me in obtaining the coupon code she needed to take the discount off our bill. I ordered the Jack Daniels Chicken tenders appetizer as my meal and a side order of fries. Both of those things were good. I ordered a new drink for myself, called the Gold Medalist, which is a non alcoholic drink slush, with pineapple juice, coconut juice, grenadine, and banana puree in it. When I tasted it, it wasn't that good. The waitress asked me how it was? I said ""not that good. It is watery tasting. I don't taste the banana in it at all or even coconut."" She offered to get me another one but I said no thank you. She checked with the bar tender who she had told me was new on the job. She came back and said that the manager said that they had a bad batch of bananas come in that weren't ripe enough to make the drink taste good. I didn't say anything to the waitress but why would you as a manager say that and then continue to serve a drink that isn't good enough to begin with? I didn't think that was a proper thing to say even if it were true. I mean, don't serve the drink at all. That told me that they only cared about getting the money for the drink than being honest with the customers on this particular drink. Other than that, my friends food was pretty good too; both of them had hamburgers and fries. My only other concern was that the wall up against our table was dirty with food spatters. As a restaurant reviewer anyways I tend to notice every little thing. I also didn't think it was right that I ordered an appetizer food as my main dinner food, that I had to wait to be served as my friends burger dinners came out before mine. My chicken tenders could have been a little hotter in temperature but still tasted good. I would recommend this restaurant overall as it was a lively place and that is what I expected from here.

19,Lina S.,"Ewa Beach, HI",33,100,199.0,4.0,2015-07-15,"Whenever I come to New York, I always make it a point to visit a nearby TGIF because Hawaii locations closed down a number of years ago. It was a comfort food location that reminds me of my childhood.  I came to this location filled with anticipation. It took a while to get a person to seat my family, despite the fact that a group of waiters standing around saw us (and notified no one). The area where we were seated was dangerously slick to the point where we slid around on the floors in our chairs for each little movement. It took a while for our table to be waited ""properly"". By this, I mean we had several waitresses walk by and ask us if we've been helped yet, some offering us to get menus or drinks and not returning. My family and I were a bit annoyed by this. When we finally got ourselves a waitress, she was just the best. She was incredibly peppy and enthusiastic about helping us out with the menu and got our food and drinks out quite fast. There was a mix-up with my appetizer and had the wrong order made for me, but was given the mistake gyoza (or ""potstickers""), on the house, alongside the correct order. We didn't have to flag her down for drink refills - or even endless wing refills! She promptly asked what flavor we wanted to try next so that, by the time we finished one plate, the next batch was already being delivered to us.  I'll most likely come back to this TGI the next time I'm in NY.

The potato skins were dry and the texture was horrible. It was completely inedible. It was so bad I had to speak to the manager. I ordered 4 appetizers, but only ate 3. My bill was $10.80, but the gratuity calculator listed the 15% gratuity as $3.69. The explanation from the manager was the gratuity was calculated on the full price of each items and not on the sell price. I told him that was misleading gratuity is calculated on to total bill. If a customer chooses to pay more that is up to the customer.  So my gratuity was calculated based on 4 appetizers , even though I only ate 3. There was no need for me  to say take this off my bill. The special was all you can eat for $10.  I think TGIFriday's get you in with specials and then gives you the middle finger as you walk out the door!

It came with the tiniest of tubs of honey mustard. When we were checked on I asked for more but it never came. The chicken was too dry to eat without anything to dip it in so I was unable to finish my meal.  All in all it's not a bad choice for something quick but filling on a budget when you're at the mall.

We tried to get his attention since he was just kind of hovering over the bar staff but was hardly doing anything. He ignored us along with a lot of others that were attempting to get his attention. The KROCK Santa Con called for us to purchase a Sam Adams Lager ($4 for a pint, good price) it wasn't a requirement to get your card signed off however this guy missed this announcement. Running around with the group I was in the designated driver was having sodas or water at the bars and while the manager at TGI Fridays did instruct the staff to singn her card he told the bartender to (keep it on the downlow as he was requiring others to purchase the lager) - one of the gals overheard this I didn't hear it directly.

Our waitress didn't come to check on us until we were we'll into our meal. We had to ask for refills and missing condiments several times from different servers. The manager did come over and apologize for the food order being wrong and did not charge us for that item, which was nice. We will probably never visit this place again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
