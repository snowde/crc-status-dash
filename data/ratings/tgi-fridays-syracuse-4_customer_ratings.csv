9,Therese G.,"Cheviot Hills, CA",443,201,2062.0,4.0,2013-01-05,"Super cool and funny waiter named Chris made the evening fun! Nice manager too. Sometimes chain restaurants get a bad rap, but every dish we had was thoroughly enjoyed and devoured. This included the Jack Daniels Babybacks, Salmon, and spinach artichoke dip. When we are in Syracuse again, we will be sure and stop in here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-4,,,,,
12,Bruce W.,"Oneonta, NY",2,33,38.0,5.0,2013-08-02,"Pot stickers beer pretzels potato skins apps. Petite 6 oz steak jasmine pilaf seasoned fries. Flat iron with langostino topping steak fries tomato mozzarella  salad.  prescotta pasta. No silverware at start, had to ask waitress for some. Food was good as the other chains, some things were a bit bland but still decent. Overall great food and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-4,,,,,
7,Justin V.,"Ithaca, NY",21,143,13.0,2.0,2014-02-28,"SO anyone who knows me KNOWS Fridays is my favorite place that all things get compared to. My recent new phrase has been ""Eh...It a'int no T.G.I.Fridays"". I love Fridays so naturally when I'm out of Ithaca I love to hit one up. We were in Syracuse and the wait at the one in the mall as 2 hours so I thought ""hey why not drive to Dewitt?"" it's out of the way and doesn't get as much business as the destiny one but as I recall from my Cazenovia College days, it was awesome. This was not the case this night. So the wait was 15 minutes, no biggie at all, I've waited 2 hours at Dino BBQ before and 3 hours for cheesecake factory, no big deal. The waitress came over and was nice and took our drink order then food order and that was the last we saw of her. Some different waitress brought our drinks over. Then 10 minutes later we got our chips and salsa. Then 20 minutes after that our apps came and I asked for an extra fork as there were just 3 place settings at the table and we had 4 people. about 15 minutes after that got our food from another different waitress and again I asked for a fork, still not having one.  Another 5 minutes, we are all waiting to eat because I couldn't. Apps had been out 20 minutes at this point and my wife and I started sharing her fork at this point. Another waitress walking by I grabbed and asked for a fork....for the third time. 5 minutes later and still no fork! I decided my wife and I were just sharing forks that night I guess. When we were done with our food our original waitress came out and refilled our drinks and then after refilling our drinks (was the only time she refilled our drinks) she remembered I needed a fork and apologized but whatever, I was done eating at that point. Not only did our food take a while (not a huge deal we were hanging out) but I asked 4, 4!!! 4 Different people for a darn fork and I never got one. Not a single one of them had the decency to just grab me a darn fork! The food was okay as well. Not the greatest version of the J.D. Burger I've had but it was good which is why this review is a 2 not a 1. Overall not coming back to the Dewitt T.G.I's....I'll go to the one at Destiny, even if I have to wait because the quality is good....Though the one in Vestal NY is still the best! So disappointed, not at the franchise but at this location...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-4,,,,,
13,Jordan p.,"Syracuse, NY",0,9,8.0,1.0,2014-03-09,"I know it was a Sunday and it's located in a dying mall but the service was not good at all.  We were seated just to wait 20 minutes until our waitress finally showed up. Then when she finally took our order she knew nothing about the menu . First I ordered one thing and she goes ""idk if we have that anymore, we are getting new menus soon"" so I started naming four more things off the menu and I receive the same answer ""idk if we have those either"" at this point I'm thinking ""you're a waitress your job is to know what you're serving and even if you're getting new menus you should still serve what's on the menu now until the new ones come In or warn the customer before they sit"". So being a non meat eater it really only left me two choices since half the menu she didn't know if they have and wouldn't go find out. I ordered the Fridays shrimp my least favorite on the menu! $14 is way to much for the Fridays shrimp especially since they are so small. Once I ordered I then asked if I can sub the fries for a baked potato and once again she replies with ""idk if we have that"" which then at that point I just gave up and went with the fries . Once the food finally came of course the food was cold which isn't the first time I've received cold food from Fridays, the first time being the one in Destiny USA mall but the manager there knew the food was sitting around before I had to say anything and he made up for it. I would have told the waitress about it but she never came back to the table to ask us how our food was and if we needed anything. I needed a refill but she never came back until we were all done eating. I am never going this is most likely my last time at TGI FRIDAYS!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-4,,,,,
5,Steve L.,"Syracuse, NY",33,277,28.0,3.0,2015-02-13,"Always difficult to write about a chain. Just popped in for a quick cheap and cheerful lunch. They do a7,8 and 9 dollar combo lunch. Some quite nice choices. Quick seating and service which I always expect for lunchtime. Broccoli and Cheddar soup and a 1/2 BLT with avocado, $6.99. The soup, unfortunately had the consistency of wallpaper paste and a strange lingering on the back of the tongue which seemed to taste like vinegar. Won't be ordering that again. Conversely, the sandwich was really nice. Crispy Ciabatta roll, plenty of bacon and avocado. I should have just ordered a whole sandwich! My wife enjoyed her chicken salad sandwich very much. Said she would have it again. All in all, quite a decent cheap quick lunch. Just remember to avoid that particular soup.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-4,,,,,
10,Erika L.,"Syracuse, NY",1,6,,1.0,2015-10-25,Every once in awhile we will eat here.  The food is typically decent and you can be seated pretty quickly.  This past visit will be my last and it was not because of the food.  The staff that work at this establishment (including the manager) are incredibly unprofessional.  They were yelling at each other around the bar and where the servers pick up their drinks for the entire time we were there.  No one was focused on the customers.  The manager is clearly part of the problem as she was engaging in the unprofessional behavior as well.  She seemed annoyed that we asked her for the bill as no one else seemed like they were willing to help us.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-4,,,,,
6,Jen M.,"Syracuse, NY",0,43,3.0,2.0,2015-11-07,My friends and I usually go for the shared apps. But tgif went down hill. Prices are very expensive.  I'm not paying 20 bucks for Cajun pasta .small to decent portions. Service sucks. Not worth it. It use to be one of my favorite restaurants,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-4,,,,,
3,Nikkie R.,"Camillus, NY",20,26,7.0,3.0,2015-11-13,"Not so much taking stars off because my husbands burger came out as raw as could be after a very long wait for it, because mistakes happen, but the server who was extremely inattentive and often no where to be found. One person out of our group of 3 got a refill on our drinks. My black bean burger was good, fries seasoned well. When my husband showed me his burger I picked it up to look and what must have been a manager of sort saw me from afar and came over quickly. He fixed it for us and took the burger off the bill. All is fine. Nice of them. Our waitress seemed to stay away from the table after that though we didn't fault her for a cooking error. Probably won't be back here due to service given the restaurant wasn't busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-4,,,,,
8,Bernie S.,"Minoa, NY",14,4,,1.0,2015-11-16,It has been nearly 2 years since my family and I have visited TGI Fridays due to a rotten avacado that was served to me(see my post from 2/8/14). I still think of this everytime I enjoy a meal out with my family and can not believe that upper management did NOTHING to resolve this complaint from a faithful weekly customer. Thanks for nothing TGI Friday. You really suck at customer service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-4,,,,,
1,Gee-Kren V.,"DeWitt, NY",60,7,1.0,1.0,2016-05-29,"I'd give this place zero stars if I could.  Don't eat here. Prices are expensive, food is low quality, menu options are limited.  The worst of it all, the service. I'm not exactly demanding when it comes to my waitress/waiter. Our meal was finished 20 minutes before the check came, and then i had to track down somebody who wasn't my server so I could pay my bill because she was hanging out at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-4,,,,,
2,Amber H.,"Jamesville, NY",3,26,,1.0,2016-07-14,"Our server was very unattentive. We waited for our food for over an hour and we're getting ready to leave.  It was not at all busy, only 4 other tables besides us. He obviously left our food in the window for a while because our plates were so hot we couldn't touch them for at least 10 minutes. When we were finally able to eat, our French fries were so salty that it was dehydrating trying to eat them.  As a stripes member for years, I expected way more than this.  Sadly, I don't believe we will be returning anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-4,,,,,
4,Natalie P.,"Elko, NV",4,7,4.0,1.0,2016-08-02,"Half of the things we ordered came out wrong. The waitress, Amber, seemed to have no idea what she was doing, and was really slow despite the fact that the restaurant was not busy at all. The food was also generally unimpressive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-4,,,,,
0,Jaime B.,"Syracuse, NY",0,4,5.0,5.0,2016-09-07,"Today I received a coupon for Friday's -  buy one entree and two beverages and receive a second entree free.  My daughter and I ordered the ribeye steaks. Her's came with fries and tomato mozzarella salad,  I ordered the sweet potato fries with the tomato mozzarella salad. The steaks were cooked to perfection-medium rare and tender and juicy!  They were seasoned well and were just amazingly good!!  Daughter said it was the best steak she's had in a long time!The sweet potato fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. And the regular fries didn't disappoint either. A very good meal!!   Also our waitress was awesome!!  Attentive, quick, friendly!  A great meal!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-4,,,,,
