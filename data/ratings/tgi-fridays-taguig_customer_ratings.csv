1,Christopher M.,"Mandaluyong, Philippines",131,57,169,2.0,2015-12-28,The food is what you would expect from a Fridays. The service is   took 30 min for our drinks to get to us. Only 20 for our appetizers. Also the meal said corn on the cob... I did not get that on my plate,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-taguig,,,,,
0,Justin D.,"Roseville, CA",205,115,566,2.0,2016-03-06,"I've been here probably 4 times in the past 6 years. I guess I'm always thinking the food will eventually taste better, but to my dismay it never does. Everytime I walk by here I notice it's always jam packed and I don't know why. The food is mediocre at best. And the prices are rediculous for the taste and quality. The food here tastes like left overs that have been through a microwave.  The only upside this past visit here is the manager that attended to us, imee, she was nice and refilled the waters regularly. The decor is nice and i guess it's cool to bring the kids here since they have crayons and balloons for the kids.  Some of the waiters aren't very good, Â honestly for the price and quality there's way way way better places to go then TGIF Friday's, like a Burger King or a Wendy's. Still don't see why this place gets busy, i guess if you like the American bar type decor and like to drink this is the place for you. Just do yourself a favor and eat elsewhere. Still have the bland pasta taste in my mouth with a side of old jar tasting salsa",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-taguig,,,,,
