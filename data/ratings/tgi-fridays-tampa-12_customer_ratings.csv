7,John S.,"Tampa, FL",0,21,,4.0,2016-01-31,Went here for the first time yesterday.  Service is good. Staff is friendly. Food was properly prepared. We will be going back. We would like it if portions was a little bigger. Maybe ours was small because we ordered one of their budget meals. It was enough though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tampa-12,,,,,
4,John G.,"Tampa, FL",408,162,221.0,5.0,2016-07-14,"I've been to Friday's hundreds of times. Maybe even more. I'll have to say, however, that this experience has probably been my best thus far. The sandwich was cooked perfectly, I could not have asked for anything better. Waitress was kind and very attentive as well, give her a raise! Decided to go with the Jack Daniels grilled chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries: delicious. My buddy got the same sandwich but went with the Mac n cheese as his side as well, and I obviously had to try it. It was pretty bomb as well, so so good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tampa-12,,,,,

2,Joey D.,"Tampa, FL",151,339,29.0,2.0,2016-09-10,"Some friends and I went to Friday's for endless apps last week and they were not very good.  Friday's in general is starting to get ahead of itself. It's going down the Outback and Applebees road where they re do the inside, add some fancy words to the menu, and jack up their prices. It's simply just not worth it anymore.  Endless apps were the best bang for your buck after looking over the menu. Our server was nice in explaining the process. Your first app is a bigger portion and the apps following that are small portions. The Memphis BBQ wings were my first choice and lacked sauce. They were almost plain wings with a drizzle of sauce. The flat bread was average the mozzarella sticks lacked cheese (see my photo).  Everything else that came afterwards was barely warm and just wasn't very good.  Between the three of us, none of us were very pleased with this visit. Our server was good, not great and overall I won't be coming back as the food just doesn't seem worth it for the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tampa-12,,,,,
3,Breonna L.,"Tampa, FL",281,228,155.0,4.0,2017-02-02,"I've been here a million times and it never disappoints as far as TGI Fridays goes.  Servers are aware and present, food arrives timely (I dont think TGI food is all that spectacular but its a chain restaurant so....), I can always find ample parking and they make my drinks just the way I like them. I usually order the sampler, the burger or the shrimp and ribs. I always order a sangria. Sometimes I'll even order to pickup. I can't complain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tampa-12,,,,,
5,Lynn H.,"New Port Richey, FL",0,11,2.0,5.0,2017-03-23,Endless apps were amazing! It is a great deal. The server was polite and very friendly. Also the manager was around visiting tables. Great visit.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tampa-12,,,,,
1,Heather S.,"Tampa, FL",426,268,846.0,4.0,2017-06-19,"For a fridays, this place is pretty good. This is the closest one to our house and it's pretty nice. The bar area is big and I prefer to sit there vs the main room because there are less children. I don't like the main area because of how close the seating is together as well.  They have a lot of options for happy hour specials daily. I got the sangria Rita. It was pretty big and strong off of one drink. I ended with a regular red wine (malbec)  As far as the food goes it's pretty much as expected. They are always creative with their burgers and sizzling dishes. The one thing that sets a fridays apart is the staff. The staff is attentive and friendly which makes a difference if I decide to come to a chain or not. Outdoor seating is available here as well with fans above.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tampa-12,,,,,
6,Mariela U.,"Tampa, FL",142,1,,1.0,2017-08-25,"This place is terrible. From the service, to the bathrooms, to management. I had to get up in the middle of my meal to throw up because of what I ate. When we informed the waitress, she said oh wow really? Never heard of that happening before. Do you want to box up the food or should i take it?"" Please, take it. Once we got our bill, it was left on. We brought it to her attention and asked why it would be there, her response was ""well, i mean you ate half of it."" My younger cousin with a little more sense replied ""yeah, that half is in the toilet because she threw it up."" (This entire time since I informed her I threw up, about 15 minutes ago, not once did a manager come see us.) Manager finally stepped in way later and took it off after hearing us out. Safe to say, we won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tampa-12,,,,,
0,Harry P.,"Tampa, FL",0,5,,5.0,2017-12-30,"We ordered the BBQ ribs and bacon crusted ribs online. Said the order would be ready at 1:04, we got there at 1:03 and the order was ready. The ribs were fantastic, the fries were good, the slaw was a little soggy but still acceptable. I do recommend this TGI Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tampa-12,,,,,
