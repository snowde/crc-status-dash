16,Jeff E.,"Tampa, FL",15,73,11.0,4.0,2012-11-12,"This restaurant is very near to where I live. Its usually a last resort option when I want to go out, but please don't let that be an indication of the food quality. Fridays has your typical American style cuisine, but  they go out of their way to put interesting little twists on it. I had korean tacos recently, and was amazed that not only were they serving something along the lines of Korean tacos, but the flavor that they managed to capture with the spices. Fridays has done a wonderful job of reinvograting their restaurants. This specific location also has fairly good service. While it can become a little hectic, the servers generally do a great job. The servers are also very good at  suggesting different food items.  The restaurant is clean and is up kept very well. I am actually borderline on rating this store a 5 star, but don't just because several times there have been one or two mistakes on orders or food not coming out completely correct. Over all though, this is a great restaurant and I recommend it to everyone",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tampa-2?start=20,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152

Service is never awful, but I never feel ""wow""-ed either. I will give them credit for an interesting rotation of new and seasonal items; they are good at keeping up with food and drink trends and implementing their own. Drinks tend to be weak and overpriced at this location as well. Like I said, I don't hate Friday's but I don't love it either.

50,Jennifer G.,"Clearwater, FL",0,249,93.0,3.0,2013-11-02,"This Friday's location is very disappointing to me. We used to have one closer in Countryside but they closed up quite awhile ago and now we have to drive to Tampa. The last 3 times we have been here the service is terrible. The last time my chicken in my cajun pasta was still pink and the manager had to take it back. I of course did not want it anymore after that. We used to go to Friday's on holidays too. Christmas was always crowded but great. This is no longer the case. We also went there last Christmas to this same location and it was terrible. I cannot judge a restaurant that I have patronized so many years over a holiday disaster. We chose to go back again. Again we were disgusted. So, we have now decided to give them another try, it had been awhile and hey, they deserved another try, right? NOT! What a joke, they must have poor management or something because you can't get service to save your life. The spinach dip appetizer was overcooked and dry. The chips were stale. We attempted to tell the server who just rolled her eyes and walked away. She never returned again until we were finished with our dinner. Literally, we had to flag down someone else when the chicken in my pasta was under cooked. I have a substantial amount of rewards even built up on my card and could easily get a free entree if I went back. That will not be happening. I think we are finished giving TGI Friday's anymore breaks. It is a bit of a drive for us since Clearwater closed and to drive to have a horrible experience time and again is not worth it to me. I guess its just another dying chain, so sad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tampa-2?start=40,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003

The servers were prompt and very friendly. Moods come and go so I wanted something healthy.   I found the menu offered various options in this regard.  I believe compromised with a turkey burger and fries.  The burger was very rich in flavor and came topped with lettuce, tomato, and onion.  It was very good size burger and took two hands.  The fries were hot and lightly salted.

13,Maurice B.,"Silver Spring, MD",210,4,,2.0,2016-04-10,"I have been to this Fridays several times and have a great experience, but this time the one thing that made my experience bad was the fact that I originally wanted a strawberry / lemonade crush, but the waitress advised me it wasn't any refills because it had real fruit in it.  I was a little confused being that I get that all the time.  So I decided to ask for a Coke, when she came back I said what happen to the strawberry/ lemonade drink that had the crush Ice in it.  She advised we have that and that's the one with the free refills. I finished my coke, she asked would you like the strawberry / lemonade I said yes.  When I received my check I was shocked to see I was charged for a Coke and Strawberry / Lemonade.  If she would have informed me it was going to be an extra 3.39 added to my bill I would have declined and just got another coke.  I just think it was very deceiving to just add another drink on the bill and not let the patron know.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tampa-2?start=20,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006

4,Laural Elayne D.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",12,6,,1.0,2016-05-14,This place smells terrible. I'm pretty sure it's just full of mold or something equally gross. Our server was not very friendly at all.

Start with chicken 1st and add on others later as additional orders. Oh yeah, final bill totals up all u ate, then subtracts to get to $10 AYCE app price.

I absolutly love the staff, a few bartenders and one of the managers. Tonight will probably be the Iast time I order takeout. Nothing about my meal was satisfying. I could barely cut my chicken, my broccoli was brown and in the plastic bag they microwaved it in, and my hard as a rock breadsticks came in a Zaxbys to go box. A Zaxbys to go box?

35,Barbara D.,"Safety Harbor, FL",0,3,,2.0,2017-05-19,"Stopped in with a friend Monday (May 15), service was decent, even though there were maybe a handful of customers.  Ordered a Chicken Caesar Salad and sweet tea.  Tea was pretty sweet but good.  I cut into the chicken and it was hard to slice (that should have told me something) and took a couple of bite and it was either not cooked or just thawed out and the lettuce was wilted somewhat but ok I thought.  Caught the server and told him the chicken was not good and he took the extra (chicken) charge off the bill.  I did eat some of the lettuce and shredded cheese, etc. on the salad part, but didn't finish. I wasn't asked if I wanted more tea.  Big Mistake! That evening I lost my lunch....all evening and into the next morning.  Clearly had food poisoning, haven't had that since I can remember....years.  Next time I'll listen to my instincts instead of my stomach.  So just beware!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tampa-2,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
