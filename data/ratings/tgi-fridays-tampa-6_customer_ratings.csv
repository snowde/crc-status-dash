The food was good and they even made the drink I ordered for me special since it was not on the menu. The portion size was really good. My daughter was able to take home leftovers and have it for lunch the next day. Â I would definitely go back to Fridays on Hillsborough Avenue.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tampa-6,,,,,
