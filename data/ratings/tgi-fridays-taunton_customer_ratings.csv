18,Pete C.,"Newark, NJ",0,2,,1.0,2012-08-28,"I usually enjoy TGI Fridays (especially the north Dartmouth location). This was my first time to Taunton and expected the same great service/food. WRONG!!! Sat at the bar on a Saturday afternoon  Bartender was awful. She (Sam was her name) must have have been very displeased to be at work or hungover. She did the bare minimum to satisfy my needs, had to ask twice for water. Food came out and was cold never was asked how anything was so didn't have a chance to tell her. Never offered a second drink when mine was empty. She was not even behind the bar for a total of 5 minutes during my 1/2 hot stay. It was not busy in the restaurant at all....I could tell because two servers were eating at a bar table in their Fridays uniform in-between visiting their tables. I will continue to visit the ND location but never Taunton. Maybe some re-training or perhaps some management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-taunton?start=20,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956

Came here with my mom after Christmas shopping at the mall last week. We went in around 930. The service was awful, I don't remember her name but she made it seem like we were inconveniencing her by being there.  Miserable looks throughout  the dinner.  Ask for blue cheese side, look of death in return. Not to mention the burger I had was the WORST burger I've ever had in my life. It looked like crap. The bun was soggy and I had to force myself to eat it. They can't cook the burgers to your liking because they are frozen. So my medium rare burger was well done. The quality of the patty resembled something  that you get served at a public high school. The patty just looked gross when I cut into it. I would have rather went to Wendy's.  The waitress was never around.

Could not even send the food back because there was no server to do so.. No refill to help get down the burn chards of beef. Took forever to get a check and get out.

Our waiter Dave was one of the best waiters I have had at a restaurant, not only did he have some fantastic locks of love, but his personality and sense of humor were also fantastic. I got the unlimited appetizers and ordered 6 dishes in total. The first thing I ordered were the sriracha potato skins, these were one of the two VERY good dishes that I had. My second order was the mozzarella sticks, this was the second VERY good dish. The next thing I ordered was the spicy chicken tostada, these were meh at best. My fourth and fifth plate were both boneless wings, the first being buffalo and the second being ghost pepper. Both of the wings were tasty. My last order was the garlic and basil flatbread, this was also pretty good. In conclusion, four of the six appetizers were great, one was ok and the other was meh. All of the dishes were aesthetically pleasing though, so that was a plus. TGI Fridays in Taunton gets a 5/5 from me.

I had the cajun chicken and shrimp pasta dish, taste was very good and good quality. However, it could have used a bit more chicken and shrimp.

We also understand working as waitstaff can get incredibly hectic. We get it. It is not entirely the wait staff's fault that we had an awful experience we had recently. We got out after closing OG at 11pm and walked over to order apps. I ordered nachos, he ordered a burger and sweet potato fries. Ordered no later than 11:25pm as listed on receipt. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting. Bartenders both asking if we need anything and a few times we asked how much longer for food. Told ""a few more minutes"" every time. These two ladies next to us are asked by a bartender, ""you ordered food, right?"" they look increasingly angry and reply ""yes...awhile ago?!?!"" the bartender logs into the system and sees the order was never sent... These were people who were sitting bar top AGES before we got there. 12:00 midnight rolls around and we finally get our food. I look to see my boyfriend has a whopping 9 sweet potato fries. He bites into one and it's hard and undercooked! My nachos are soggy and unbelievably cold. We walk back in and talk to a manager. He basically asked us what we wanted him to do and never really offered an apology. However, he offered to remake my nachos and make more fries for my boyfriend. He claims he could have them done in 4 minutes. Now, I get how busy the linecooks can be but there were 3 tables and a couple ladies at the bar... Why did they take an hour before????? Anyways, we got the properly cooked food and left. I might not come back for awhile. There was a bartender named Justin he was the only one who seemed genuinely apologetic and was even more professional than the manager on at the time.

Also, by the time we got our appetizers we had ordered our food and our drinks needed refills....which we waited 30 more minutes for. When our food did arrive, my steak had been cooked on one side only and my friend's smokehouse stacker burger was missing the peppers, onions, sausage and bacon.

21,Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",161,1505,24565.0,4.0,2017-02-25,"As a whole company, TGI Fridays is one of my favorite chain restaurants tied with Chili's and a few others. In this section of Taunton (near the mall), there aren't all that many restaurant options that appealed to me. Sure UNO's and Papa Gino's are good, but I wasn't in the mood for pizza, and up until recently I didn't even know what Smokey Bones was, so I ended up coming here for lunch, on both occasions when I have been in Taunton. And telling from the other reviews (especially in comparison to other Friday's), they are accurate that this one is just slightly better than some of the others.  There are definitely some other locations that are newer and nicer, but in total, my experiences here have been wonderful and definitely worthy of four stars. Especially in comparison to my experience in the Mansfield location where it was just problem after problem after problem (check out that Yelp page!). Anyway, waiters and waitresses here are friendly and the restaurant is widespread in that it looks small from the outside but inside is huge. They have more tables than most other chain restaurants of the type and more booths too. I find the decor to be entertaining and enriching the experience of TGI overall. In general, this location was extremely clean and seems well kept. Bathrooms were also sparkling. Parking lot is large and never that loaded with cars.  Food is good. Best things on the menu are the burgers, sandwiches, and those brownie desserts (the best).  I have no complaints about this TGI Fridays and highly suggest it as a very good restaurant for families or for anyone else. The bar is also fine.  Location of this restaurant is sort of weird, being off the main road, but it works since there is a shopping center across the street.  4 stars for TGI in Taunton.

Two of us had steamed spinach as a side-one was cooked properly and the other literally had raw leaf spinach on the plate. The rice pilaf was actually chilled, not room temperature. One of our party has been in the foodservice industry for 10 years and brought some plates to the manager, who comped everyone's meals, but seemed unapologetic at best.
