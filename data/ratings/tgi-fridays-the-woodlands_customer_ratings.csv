Not many options are out there for late night eating during the week. I had the bourbon Mahi Mahi with Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. The fish was very tasty and cooked well. The sides were hot and flavorful and my tummy was happy. My boyfriend had a steak with the same sides and he was pleased as well.

Since it was after midnight, the place was practically empty, so we were greeted very enthusiastically. Now before I get to the problem, I would like to say that the service we received was great; our server, Eva, was very helpful and nice and did everything that she could for us. The problems came from the kitchen...when my girlfriend received her salad, we noticed a weird, coarse black hair near the edge of her plate. We let our server know, and she apologized profusely and took it off the check. Shortly after, however, we got our drink refills only to find ANOTHER hair wrapped around the glass held in place by the condensation...I've never had that happen twice in one sitting. The food tasted fine overall; I ordered some of the cider-glazed boneless wings and it looked like they were thrown together pretty hastily even though they weren't the least bit busy.

Anyway, last Friday I visited this restaurant with high expectations (being that the name is Fridays) and I was sorely disappointed. The security there was awful, if that place was ambushed we'd all be dogtags in a pile of bones, but nevermind that. I was quickly seated by a beautiful little host to a booth upon request. I was sat and greeted by my waiter, Dexter. An outgoing and I think homosexual little half black man. He was a sweet guy and tended to my every need. I chose to eat the kids chicken tenders because I'm a goddamn man and I can eat whatever I want. It took a fair 20 minutes to get my chicken tendies which wasn't bad. They were a little to crunchy for my taste but then one of them was fine, so quality control is a thing to worry about. It was better than eating MRE's in a bunker with artillery raining down on us, but that's not saying much. I creeped into the back of the kitchen to swipe some free food and maybe some plates (I broke mine at home after a fit relating to my PTSD threw me into a gunfight with my fine China. I escaped the restaurant without paying because as a veteran and an old man, I've done wayyyyyy to much tax payment and service for some chicken fingers. I'm rating three stars because the plates I stole were dirty and the host upfront wouldn't accept my phone number. I recommend this establishment if you're looking for free plates and bomb ass chicken tenders. BOMB?! TAKE COV- sorry, it's the PTSD. Alrighty yelp I'm signing out, this is your favorite grandpa - Larry Mattlock",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-the-woodlands,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003

Well the other day we placed an order and got it delivered through GrubHub. We ordered (2) half rack of ribs and some super green veggies, mash potatoes and jasmine rice pilaf. It was so good! I wasn't expecting too much but they lived above their expectations. The ribs were tender and all the sides were nicely prepared and not overly salted. We loved it so much we went into the restaurant a few days later and sat at the bar and ordered the same thing. The best part was they had a special going which I wasn't aware of when I placed the GrubHub ordered, we got a full rack of bbq ribs for only $12! Our server/bartender Isaiah was very nice and attentive. Our food was just as good that day we dined in. Side note they also have different drink specials for each day of the week, and it's all day. The cocktail specials were really cheap, most of them $3! I didn't order any drinks but good to keep in mind for the future. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-the-woodlands,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003
