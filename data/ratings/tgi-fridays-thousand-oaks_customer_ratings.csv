3,Amy S.,"Moorpark, CA",20,83,4.0,3.0,2012-01-16,"It was fine, the bartender was very nice.  I just thought the prices were way to high for the appetizers.  We got some drinks and just wanted a small bite.  We ordered the fried green beans and the cheeseburger sliders (the Green beans had 100 less calories than the sliders yowsers!) but my issue was the portion for the cost.  The green bean fries came on a plate.  Usually you might pay a little more if it is a healthier option (whatever) but it was not. It was just overpriced.   They probably did us a favor by not giving us more of those tasty, yet not worth it since they are so bad for me, ""beans""!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-thousand-oaks,,,,,
0,Greg W.,"Agoura Hills, CA",103,661,80.0,3.0,2012-01-26,So this is a typical TGI Friday's bar and restaurant.  Like most TGI's they make a lot of their money from booze that that shows as to their menu selections and the seating arrangements (and the floor can be stick a lot).  However TGI really has an AWESOME rewards club so like every other meal is free (net once you max out the coupon cheese).  I do take my family here so its kid friendly and always has decent food.   They carry a nice range of selection.  The Jack Daniels sauced items are really good.  I would recommend getting one if you have never had one (and their is no booze so no worries).  They also have some good deals in the right sized portions menu.  You will not stuff yourself or overspend but you will not leave hungry or dissatisfied.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-thousand-oaks,,,,,
9,Brittney W.,"Camarillo, CA",53,14,2.0,4.0,2012-01-27,"I am an addict to TGIFridays. I have only ever had one waitress that wasn't the greatest but I still got my food on time and it was delicious. The drinks are good and worth the money. My favorite appetizer and meal would be the crispy green beans with the wasabi ranch and the sizzling chicken and shrimp plate with mash potatoes and chopped bell peppers and onions... Yum yum yum bottom line: great food, great drinks, yummy dessert if you can get to that and reasonable prices. And terrific service!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-thousand-oaks,,,,,

4,Kevin S.,"Valencia, CA",0,50,,1.0,2012-02-20,"I don't expect much from a chain sportsbar staffed by people in stripey shirts. Fortunately for me, I got even less. We stopped in for a quick drink and waited ten minutes to get any service in the bar. There were maybe four tables in the bar, one of which had a waitress posted at it for the entire time. I understand being friendly is important to earning tips, but when customers have to ask you to do your job when you're working for tips and you deliver it at a snail's pace with attitude: you're done. I even had to walk the check to the register to pay it after waiting five minutes. I've had better service during a mugging... and I got out of it without having to leave a tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-thousand-oaks,,,,,
12,Julian S.,"Fillmore, CA",22,17,3.0,1.0,2012-02-28,"The place was dead when we sat down, everyone that got there after us got served food before us. It must have been the fact that we weren't drinking. Service took forever that we just walked out. Kinda' felt bad but I was starving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-thousand-oaks,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
7,Theodore S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",41,255,88.0,2.0,2012-03-11,"This place has gone downhill since I left Thousand Oaks. I used to eat and drink here once a week on Monday's during football season. I came here with some old friends recently and will most likely not come back again. We had 3 different bartenders and no one seemed to know anything about customer service. I was prepared to have a few beers and some appetizers but instead I was forced to have 1 beer and a sampler. I had to get the manager involved in order to get my bill to leave. She gave me a huge discount, but with service like the kind I had I should have been comped. Maybe this place is better when they have less bartenders and servers with more people to serve. This place is dissapointing. I give them 2 stars because they used to be awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-thousand-oaks,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76

8,Jaclyn H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",28,58,1.0,2.0,2012-05-28,"Good riddance, Fridays! Every time I go (or went here I should say) it's been the same thing, slow service and being stuck there much longer than I would like to be! I would try and enjoy my time there with my mother for their 2 for $20 deal which was okay. Decent appetizer and meal that arrives on a moderately hot plate and a dessert on a cold one. Can't really complain about bar food, you get what you pay for right? But shit! Service was so slow It would take forever for us to get any refills on our beverages and they didn't even get the drinks right on our bill! Really? I don't think either of us ordered a Palmer. So by the time we got the bill and wanted to get the hell up on outta there we had to wait for forever for them to come back with the correct bill, then wait forever to get the debit card back. Processing our payment was just as slow as our shitty service. Oh not to mention they didn't even listen to us. The food runner had dropped the burger bun on our floor and my mom said it's fine, and not to get another one (she doesn't eat any bread) and the runner comes back with another one anyways. Cause we want some dumb loner bun just sitting at our table. Since it was so busy I wouldn't be surprised if the food runner probably circled around the place and brought the same floor-bun back to my mom! This was an almost decent place for eating but far from a GOOD memorable experience for dining!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-thousand-oaks,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
