I ordered the spinach flatbread ( sooooo good) & the crusted chicken pasta ( soooo good) & my friend ordered the white cheddar queso dip with the same pasta as myself!!!!  Not only was the food good but my friend and I were full and took some home!!!!  If your on a budget, if your not on a budget check this menu out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park?start=40,2.7079999999999997,2.7079999999999997,2.7079999999999997,2.7079999999999997,2.7079999999999997
44,Maximilian Z.,"Chicago, IL",2,27,9.0,4.0,2013-03-03,"This location is just off of Harlem & I-80 in the corner of a strip mall. Three words for this place: ""Jack Daniels menu"".  Order ANYTHING you like from it, and it's always good.  I'm in here at least twice a month for either the JD BBQ chicken breast, or, especially recently - the JD salmon.  The JD salmon has always been cooked right for me and has never been served burnt or dried out. The last time I was here, I saw a spiked Guinness shake on the menu, and had to try it.  That was one sneaky shake - just the right amount of sweet and stout to excite the palate. Their menu computer is even smart enough to ask about food allergies if you specify something out of the norm: like ""no extra nuts on my Brownie Obsession"".  I'm not allergic to nuts, but they're not a nice thing to bite into with dentures :O The ambiance depends a LOT on the time of day & if there's local sports on TV.  It tends to be on the upper ends of the noise spectrum, especially if it's a Friday  / Saturday night.  I tend to be here during lunch a lot, so the place is well lit during the day, and the right amount of light at night. If you want better service, and DON'T have kids with you, eat in the bar area.  It's much quicker, and you don't have to deal with screaming kids in the main dining room.  (Oh, did my fork accidentally pop your kids balloon?  I'm sorry...) Since I'm here often, I tend to be a bit overly critical of this particular location because I know the food is good and I expect EVERYTHING to be good.  If it's NOT, I know exactly who the GM is (and I DON'T tell the server before hand I know who the GM is - I want real, unbiased service), and believe me, she will address and fix the problem before I leave.  I also make sure to tell her that the servers did an exceptional job, and I let my tips reflect that as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park?start=40,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544

The menu has everything you could want: ribs, chicken, fish, and all of it at a great price. The 2 for $10 menu is a STEAL!  The decor is perfect for the feel of this restaurant, and there's a reason why this is a nation wide chain.

Who goes to TGIF in a city as amazing at providing delicious local food as Chicago? Apparently the fans that took me out to dinner after my Chicago show. I can't complain because they insisted on buying me dinner which was lovely. But I really didn't order much because I can't stand TGIF.

33,Crystal S.,"Frankfort, IL",27,41,92.0,1.0,2014-04-07,"Ive always loved fridays but today when i went in for the ""endless lunch"", i was super disappointed to find out they got rid of it and  another dinner entree i loved. For a pesc-atarian, i was forced to order a black bean burger (which i don't like), or the fridays shrimp if i was gonna keep it on the lower-price side. I was honestly upset that i had to pay for this lunch. My lunch was bland and it looked like they threw it on the plate! The shrimp had no flavor at all and i maybe ate half. They were really crunchy and still has the tails attached with crunchy breading(?) on it. They got ride of the grilled shrimp skewers which were way better than this. The entree has the company name on it and is a poor example of dinners I've enjoyed here in the past.  I got the mozzarella sticks also, which were super delicious but no enough to be an entree or redeem the restaurant for the yucky shrimp. They also no longer have the pick 3 for 12.99 that included the dessert. Kind of mad about all of the stripes points i have to spend now because id been saving them for about a year and a half to get some of their decent entrees.  Our waitress was also slow and didn't bring us any napkins with our food.  Fridays is really going downhill in my opinion.

A bunch of workers congregating on the side doing nothing I guess mentioning the fact that I had the audacity to ask them to do something....that was their job and a possibly a badreflection on their restaurant. Needless to say, I won't be back.

She glared and laughed at us as we were trying to leave. We were assured she would be removed but found out by calling 25 minutes later that she was allowed to stay in the restaurant and continue on with her night. It is not okay to treat other people that way, especially someone who is handicapped, but it's even more insulting that she was allowed to stay in the restaurant as if were actions weren't totally inappropriate and disgusting.

Our waitresses name was Sarah and she was very nice and attentive. I ordered the Parmesan-crusted chicken with a fresh tomato & mozzarella salad and cheddar Mac & cheese, and I have to say it was absolutely delicious. Great food at a reasonable price.

8,Mani S.,"Chicago, IL",226,10,1.0,1.0,2017-05-18,Extremely poor service.  My friend's and I came during a very slow hour.  We were given a menu and then later told it was only for the bar. We asked to move to the bar area. No one came to help move the table. We had to move all items on our table to the bar area ourself.  Then we waited 20 minutes for someone to come over and acknowledge us only to find our precious server didn't put our order in. I will never again visit this Fridays,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88

6,Ava W.,"Tinley Park, IL",6,14,33.0,1.0,2017-07-22,"First time in my life I didn't give a tip.  I came during the week at a very slow time not many people in the restaurant.  It was four of us and we were seated immediately.  During the course of our meal no one came to refresh our drink or remove all the plates, napkins and garbage that had accumulated at our table. At the end of the meal I asked the waitress why wasn't our table cleaned she stated we don't clean your table until you leave. I talked with the manager and she apologized but you could tell she didn't really care either.  I will never eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
11,Tanya H.,"Bedford Park, IL",0,1,2.0,1.0,2017-08-04,"disappointing meal, and the service took forever. We had a group of about 17, which I could understand taking a little extra time, but it took about 35 minutes from the time we ordered until the time we got our food. Most of it you could tell was sitting for a while, and wasn't as hot as the food should've been. We saw the manager go to a few other tables, but it seemed like she was avoiding us since she probably knew how terrible our service was. Also they stuck our group back by the washrooms, with the tables that have half booths and half chairs, and they pushed the tables all the way against the wall, so the first person to sit down on the booth side had to scoot all the way against the wall and couldn't get up to go to the washroom without asking the 7 other people next to her to scoot back out",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
23,Charlotte D.,"Matteson, IL",0,1,,1.0,2017-08-11,"This is the First time I felt compelled to write a review. Me and my Family went here for dinner on late Friday evening. It wasn't busy at all. As soon as you walk in the greeters were nowhere to be found, finally someone comes to take us to our seat. Walking to our seat the Hostess apologizes for how dirty the restaurant looks! Well that was an understatement....it was Beyond Dirty, it was Filthy and Disgusting! The floor was covered with Food and Trash. The overall restaurant was just a Mess! The menus were falling apart. We had to cover our drinks and food with napkins from the nets that were flying around. The service was horrible, waited forever for refill on drinks. Food was semi warm to cold. Bread sticks were hard. Server never took away dirty dishes and glasses. It just sat on the table piled up. As we were leaving out the door someone dropped food near the front door near the hostess area and it just stayed there while the hostess just continued on her phone texting. We finally leave just to see more food on the ground outside the restaurant and half of the staff outside joking around and taking a cigarette break. Staff definitely lazy and just don't care! We used to Love this place... But WE WILL NEVER GO BACK to this DUMP! Please save yourself the trip and the Disappointment!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park?start=20,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
3,Carlyse O.,"Park Forest, IL",85,34,9.0,3.0,2017-08-12,"I  visited this location today with my cousins to have lunch after a movie. We ordered our drinks and waited patiently for our food. Me and one of my cousins ordered the endless apps, which were great. Another cousin of mine is vegan, meaning she does not eat cheese or dairy products in addition to not eating meat. She ordered the black bean burger on the gluten-free bread with no cheese and no sauce. The first time her Burger came out it was a regular burger with cheese on it on the gluten-free bread. The waiter took it away and returned with a new burger that was a black bean burger placed on the Original Burgers bun with all the toppings including melted cheese on the top of the bread. We then spoke to a manager who made sure her meal was correct finally. It was very disappointing that they lazily tried to replace the Patty  on the burger instead of making her a whole new order. The waiter was very accommodating and the manager comped her meal. It still may be a while before either of us go to the TGIFriday location again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6

Disgusting, filthy,musty smelling is an under statement. Cob webs,wallpaper falling off the walls, just gross!! My Mom pointed out how filthy her silverware was(3 sets) to the waitress and she said ""I always use the plasticware"" Are you kidding me!? Even my 6yr old said she felt ""blah"" and wanted to leave!! Never again!!

21,Rori N.,"Richton Park, IL",0,4,,1.0,2017-08-23,"I will start by saying that my husband and I frequent this TGIF's once every week or two however tonight I went with 5 other women and it was the worst experience I have ever had at this particular restaurant! First after waiting to be seated for 10 minutes, when we could clearly see many empty seats, we were seated. Took the waiter another 10 minutes to acknowledge we were even there. Did bring us the chips and salsa that he must have heard us talking about and  a significant portion of the chips were soggy. After taking our order and walking away we realized that he never asked about drinks! We got him to come back, ordered drinks but then it took him another 20 minutes to come back and tell us that the bartender just told him they were out of Cabernet! We chose not to substitute. Then one of the people at our table ordered an appetizer for her meal and we specifically asked him to bring it with our entrees. It showed up about 10 minutes before the rest of the food and it wasn't even cooked all the way. She sent it back!Then the rest of the entrees showed up anybody with fries, the fries were cold! My Cheeseburger showed up and had bacon on it and wasn't supposed to! I sent it back! Another one came out and again completely wrong!!! The waiter had repeated what it was supposed to be correctly so it was obviously not his fault. Apologized for the problems and said everything had been coming out of the kitchen wrong tonight. I asked to speak to the manager who didn't come over to our table for another 10-15 minutes, we informed her of the situation, she apologized and adjusted the check with and additional amount off but I doubt if we will ever return to this establishment!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

14,Anne R.,"Mokena, IL",0,17,9.0,2.0,2017-09-22,"Oh, Boy!  You know what you're gonna get at Friday's.  It's a chain place...one step above fast food.  The food was average, the way it always is.  The issue with this Friday's is the service.  I don't know if the wait staff is just young, or new, or what, but it was a disaster from the moment we sat down.  We heard the words ""I'm sorry"" from our waitress 9 times...way too many for one simple meal.  First we waiting a good 15 minutes before we were asked if we wanted a drink.  There was hardly anyone in there.  We order a chicken nacho appetizer, and were given the wrong one.  We weren't sure if it was wrong, so we tried to flag her down to check.  She did place the order for the incorrect one, and credited our bill for the one actually ordered, only to charge us for the wrong one that we didn't want.  So we had to pay for something we didn't want.  That, unfortunately, came out of her tip.  Getting refills for iced tea required 4 requests, and it just went on and on like that the entire visit. We will go to just about anywhere else next time we are in that shopping area.  All I can say is this...if you have a hankering for Friday's...endless apps, drinks, or Jack Daniel's everything...do yourself a favor and drive the extra 10 minutes to the Orland Park location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
7,Jill H.,"Tinley Park, IL",0,13,,1.0,2017-09-23,Had two horrible carry out experiences with this restaurant.  The second time was the last straw. The person taking the order didn't know the questions to ask and messed everything up. When my husband went to get the food it was wrong and the bartender had an attitude about it.  My bruschetta pasta had clearly been sitting for at least an hour because the sauce was dried and grainy and my husband's steak was raw and cold in the center. The steak had to be remade three times and aside from picking up the food we had to go back to get corrected food. The manager was not helpful and was very condescending. I said I wanted my money back and she said she couldn't. I'm still waiting for general manager to call me back as the steak is definitely a health department issue.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
5,Kg M.,"Joliet, IL",0,30,,1.0,2017-11-23,Oh my goodness...I will never return to this location. I went on thanksgiving which was a huge mistake on my part. Food took an hour but thats to be expected because they were understaffed. My food was missing items(bacon) I was given about 15 fries. I am not the type to complain and send food back because I don't want the yelp special* My S.O's dish was incorrect too. Nobody was offered refills. I understand that they were understaffed but they dropped the ball in every way possible.
