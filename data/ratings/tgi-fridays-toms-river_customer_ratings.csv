21,Jenn H.,"Keyport, NJ",0,11,,1.0,2013-08-24,"First of all after being seated for a family dinner we were passed by a female server wearing next to nothing in her bottom half. This is a family restaurant and you have servers walking around with nothing on ! I understand trying to get tips but that was flat out disgusting. Secondly we placed out order and once Approached with our food things got worse. I had ordered the sizzling chicken and cheese which is supposed to come out ""sizzling"" meanwhile the plate was barely luke warm ! Then to top it off my cousin ordered a prime burger no tomato and no lettuce with only onion and pickles. She's receives the burger which had lettuce and tomato and no onion and no pickles. So we sent it back for a replacement. When it was brought back out it was clearly apparent that they just took off the lettuce and tomato and put on onions and pickles which was clear from the two holes in the top of the bun from the toothpick holding it together !  Problem being my cousin is DEATHLY allergic to tomatoes. So had we not noticed this she could have died ! So now while everyone else has had their food we again have to send it back and she ordered a new item. Our server informed us she had notified the manager as well. By the time my cousins food came out and we could all eat, all of our food was cold ! I also don't think it's right that the manager, knowing the situation, never once approached the table to see if things were okay. What kind of manager doesn't go to a table of someone his own staff just nearly killed ?! I am outraged and I will never visit again. The only plus of this was our server was incredibly nice and understanding.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toms-river?start=20,,,,,
22,Angie C.,"Oceanside, NY",39,110,59.0,2.0,2014-07-05,"I came here because I was in jersey and didn't see anything else around, until after of course. I have NEVER had a good experience at Fridays. I keep trying to give them chances and every time something horrible happens. My boyfriend always like Fridays but I don't really let him eat there because I think it's gross. I work for a corporate restaurant, so I understand but I don't at the same time. Either my luck is that bad or Fridays is just disgusting. At this particular Fridays, I read the reviews before and prayed that there were just way to many negative people! The place was filthy. It had a horrible smell there were flies everywhere, and our waitress was pretty slow. The servers kind of looked like they don't maintain there cleanliness and don't care about there appearance. We ordered our food and drinks....I do gotta say the potato skins were really good I was surprised, and my friends beer looked like it was out of a picture. When my burger came , I started eating and there was a weird curly hair in my french fries, it was so gross. I know things happen (this has happened to me at a few different Fridays locations so something they are doing isn't right). They did ask me if I wanted something else but I didn't and they did take the burger off but this was Fridays last chance with me I guess I'm going to stop trying",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toms-river?start=20,,,,,
15,Rob G.,"Astoria, NY",2,7,,4.0,2014-12-27,"I'm writing this review not based on any particular experience but because I just had a very unfavorable experience at another local restaurant and was bothered to see how long the scores were of this mainstay that I do love going to. I was tempted to give 5 stars but feel that no place is always perfect so I settled for 4. Every time I visit Friday's, I have a wonderful experience. Service is consistently prepared and timely in greeting and delivery of food/drinks. Often, the servers are rather upbeat and conversational adding to the cozy vibe. I especially feel that the prices are reasonable for the quality of food that you receive. The atmosphere is always comfortable, and my family and I have a ball.  Not to mention the incredible Jack Daniel's offerings. Each and every dish on that special menu will leave you desirous of more. The sauce is something that you can't get anywhere else. That alone would keep me coming back for more!  I no longer live in the area but when I do come home to visit my family, I make sure that we have at least one meal there as the ones in NYC are far too expensive for me to justify attending.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toms-river,,,,,
18,Jessica R.,"Toms River, NJ",57,115,60.0,4.0,2015-03-15,The bartenders are awesome so is the wait staff but for some reason the bar has this Oder it's a shame but me and boyfriend love hanging out at the toms river location but drive to brick because of the smell of the bar idk what it is,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toms-river,,,,,
7,Jindy E.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",62,44,72.0,5.0,2015-07-07,"Always loved TGIF in toms river. Maybe it's the nostalgia,  who knows. Anyway, the waiters are always friendly.  There's never a long wait to be seated or for food. There's always excellent deals and music.  As for food it's all good... unless you're looking for gourmet.  The appetizers are always a go. Overall... good for a small hangout spot for food and drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toms-river,,,,,
17,Andrew D.,"Manchester Township, NJ",46,13,8.0,2.0,2015-11-01,"Food was great, service was great. But we had to hold our baby the hold time. In other words they did not have a high chair for us. Not that I don't love holding my baby girl but I'd like to eat my dinner without a baby reaching for my food and utensils. Not a happy camper.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toms-river,,,,,
19,Sue C.,"Toms River, NJ",14,31,5.0,2.0,2015-11-28,Met up with a friend that I haven't seen in awhile. This was our first visit to Friday's newly renovated bar. It looks like a Manhattan eatery and the drink prices reflect it as well. Almost $7 for a pint of Angry Apple Orchard and $11 for 6 oz glass of wine. They used to have the most entertaining bartenders. But the ones there tonight we're just there to take our order and walk away. Complete blah. But at least I received a chilled glass for my white wine so that was a huge bonus.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toms-river,,,,,
9,Craig S.,"Toms River, NJ",3,16,3.0,1.0,2016-01-16,So we decided to order Take Out from Friday's and the portions were something off of a kids menu. I spent 45.00 for two Entrees and it wasn't enough to fill a 4 yr old. I guess they don't care once you leave the building..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toms-river,,,,,
2,Dee M.,"Lacey Township, NJ",100,146,148.0,5.0,2016-02-21,"Whoa! What happened to Friday's? No more stuff hanging on the walls, no more servers covered in ""flair"" with all the badges, etc. Friday's grew up! I like it! This location is nice, tastefully decorated, airy and clean. The employees all looked happy and welcoming.  Ordered the pot stickers, and a couple of burgers. I'm happy to see they know what a medium cooked burger is - done right, tasted good, all fresh. The ot stickers were cooked well, tasted good and are filling!  Waitress, Nicole, was very attentive and friendly. Prices are comparable with other places in the area. I'd go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toms-river,,,,,
16,John B.,"Toms River, NJ",0,26,6.0,1.0,2016-07-19,"Stopped here because I was having a craving for steak, on my way home from work, and they have ribeye on the menu. I should have known better, but I had to find out for myself I guess. Order the rib-eye medium-rare, it came out well done. Really???? Well done and medium-rare are at the opposite ends of the spectrum. 20 minutes later I received another steak, it was the worse gristle covered inedible piece of meat that I have ever had. I guess this was my punishment for sending the steak back. This was my first time here, and it will definitely be the last. The waitress gave me coupons for free dessert next time I come in. I won't be using those. I guess the moral of the story is, if you come into a restaurant like this, don't expect much from the steak. Stick with the other items. I'm leaving with my craving intact",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toms-river,,,,,
13,Krista Z.,"Beachwood, NJ",43,3,,3.0,2016-08-05,"Atmosphere very pleasant, our waitress Petra very attentive and knowledgeable of the meals. Limited selections of the menu. Food good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toms-river,,,,,
12,Skylar H.,"Manahawkin, NJ",3,6,1.0,2.0,2016-08-10,"Disorganized. Weird seating layout, staff gets flustered easily. Waited a half an hour for a refill on my soda, entrees where not coming out together. Friends and I all started eating at different times. Servers do not deliver your food, bus boys do, was offered someone else's food 3 times while I was there. Not impressed, don't know if I will come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toms-river,,,,,
10,BeanzTrader M.,"Toms River, NJ",0,12,5.0,1.0,2016-11-03,"I never blame the staff as they were all friendly , nice and attentive . How any of these box store restaurants survive is beyond me.  Food was fast food on a plate with silverware. Everyone had stomach aches when they got home and nobody was happy. Was all simple stuff too: wings, burgers, couple salads, nothing you would think could be crappy.  Chicken Caesar Salad was typical Romain fluffed up in an overly large bowl to make it look big, with a completely uncut cutlet thrown on top with barely enough dressing to dampen a napkin. Cobb Salad with Shrimp had maybe 5 shrimp.  Those little baby ones you get a bag of 50 for $10 at Costco.  Kids said burgers were OK, which means they suck in kids terms. Chicken wings were typical Cisco prepackaged ready for fryer industrial brand. Its not the first time we got skunked here either. Its been about a year, and we figure to give it a shot since they did some renovations inside.  Maybe its a decent place to eat shitty apps and watch a game during happy hour, but find a Diner or Mom & Pop shop to get a decent meal with the family instead on this place.  I dont do many reviews, but felt I had to because the food sucked. I feel bad for the workers, because they are just trying to do their job and have to work with what they have. Sentinel Capital Partners, if you really want to change things for the better, tighten up the menu, do a few things really great, and up the quality of the food. It will help the company, the staff and improve the ratings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toms-river,,,,,
11,Steve R.,"Brick, NJ",1,20,,5.0,2016-11-26,Went to TGIF tonight 9/5/2016 with my wife.  Wife had sizzling chicken and shrimp.  I had cobb salad and we had endless apps (by the way last nite for endless apps I understand..cheesecake for dessert.  Steve was our waiter and very attentive and friendly. Food was excellent. Music was loud but we could still have a conversation.we will be back..sat in booth in bar area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toms-river,,,,,
4,Gwen M.,"Belmar, NJ",0,3,,1.0,2017-01-02,"Waited an hour for dried out burgers and disgusting fries, and they got the order wrong. Horrible service. We had to send someone to find our server for drink refills. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toms-river,,,,,
14,Taylor A.,"Old Bridge, NJ",0,30,,1.0,2017-01-06,"The chicken finger and fry order, you'd think theres no way anyone can mess this up. But, it was like eating McDonalds chicken selects. Fries were cold.This was just a stop on our way back from the shore plus we had a giftcard to use, I don't like the franchise to begin with even the one by my house has served me raw chicken.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toms-river,,,,,
3,Alexis F.,"Toms River, NJ",119,27,12.0,5.0,2017-03-18,"Love the bartenders Sam, and Larry. We go every other Saturday when they have bingo, and Trivia. It's a nice night out if your not looking to party, and they host the game on crew every Saturday. My husband and I enjoy it and after a few visits we really felt like the staff knows us which makes it so comfortable. Other than that, I mean it's fridays. The food is fridays food :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toms-river,,,,,
8,Monica J.,"Mercerville-Hamilton Square, Hamilton Township, NJ",43,1,,5.0,2017-04-18,"Went here for dinner last Friday and we had such wonderful service! Our waitress Alyssa was amazing!! So helpful and sweet. A very friendly and nice waitress. Our food was great, I had the Bruschetta chicken. The kids had their full kids meals with dessert. Our drinks were always filled and we walked away full and happy. The manager Dylan  checked in on us and was also super friendly and nice!! Great service and experience all around! We will be back hopefully soon and will be asking to sit in Alyssa section :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toms-river,,,,,
6,Chellie B.,"Toms River, NJ",0,7,,1.0,2017-04-26,"Ever wonder what a 2 star chain restaurant looks like? Go here to find out. As I write this review, I'm sitting at the bar watching 3 bartenders hit on every girl at the bar as they neglect to offer me my check... drinks are always weak and for some reason  no one here knows how to fill your glass all the way to the top. Seriously, my boyfriend and I bet on how full it will be next round. So you pay 9$ for a glass of watery liquor.. one bartender looks like Ronnie from jersey shore and has a issue smiling at anyone who isn't a young girl with her boobies hanging out or his bro. Don't waste your time here. Shotty drinks, very neglectful and grumpy/nasty bar staff and the bar is always sticky and smelly...this isn't the first or even the 2nd chance I have given this insult to a decent chain restaurant and we are finally over it. Keep in mind, this is all about the bartenders. We don't eat here so we haven't experienced the wait staff. This is just a local place to go and try and have a drink after a long day at work. But never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toms-river,,,,,

1,John F.,"Toms River, NJ",1,25,,2.0,2017-12-17,"My wife and I stopped by for burgers for an early dinner. She had a regular cheeseburger and I had the giant mac n cheese burger. My wife said her burger was ok, but nothing out of the ordinary. I ordered my burger with no onions, and it showed up with onions, the fried mac n cheese on the burger was mostly just a breaded and fried patty of some sort containing very little mac n cheese. The bacon was tough and chewy and the tomato wasn't ripe. Overall the food was disappointing. We asked for a few extra napkins that we never got. We don't go to TGI Fridays often and I doubt we'll be going back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toms-river,,,,,
