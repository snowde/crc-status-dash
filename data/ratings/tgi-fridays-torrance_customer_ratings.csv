293,Anna V.,"West Covina, CA",30,6,,1.0,2012-01-28,"GLASS in dessert.... We dined here on 1/28/12 and everything was going great. The wait was not bad (30mins) , the service was ok (usual busy Sat night), and the food came out quickly. No complaints about service prior to dessert.  My boyfriend and I ordered the the 3 course meal for $20, which included 1 starter, 2 entree's, and 1 dessert. The meal was completed and we chose the strawberry shortcake sundae. After about 3 bites, my boyfriend scooped some ice cream and felt something sharp in his mouth. Thinking that it was ice, he moved the object with his tongue and spit it out immediately. Between his fingers was a shard of glass. While examining the shard of glass he noticed that the roof of his mouth had been cut by the glass and was bleeding. He even used the napkin to blot the area to make sure he wasn't mistaking the blood taste in his mouth.  Our waitress was called over (Brittany) and she said, ""Oh my gosh, are you ok?! Let me go get my manager!"" She quickly went and got her manager. Mike, manager who came to our table, asked ""What happened? May I see the glass? Was it found in the dessert?""  in that exact order. After answering all of the questions, he then asked, ""Are you ok?"" My boyfriend replied with, ""Yes, but I was suprised to find the glass in the ice cream and the roof of my mouth is bleeding."" The manager then proceeds with,""Well, I'm glad you are ok, that is my main concern."" My boyfriends card had already been charged with the total of our meal and Mike asked for the bill so that he could make some adjustments to it. He came back and said that since we had so many promotions, he tried to reduce our bill without interupting the discounts we had already had. ( Our bill included 2 orders of the 3 course for $20 and a child dinner.)  Mike ended up taking $30 off of our bill and apologized for what happened.  We eat at TGI Friday's often and normally, we are satisfied with the service and quality of food. The problem I am having is that the situation was not handeled properly. Glass, especially in food is extremely dangerous. We, at the table (4 adults, 1 child) did not cause a scene. We did not announce to the whiole restaurant that something was wrong. That was not our intention to get a free meal nor did we expect our meal to be free.  I am disappointed that Mike brushed off the situation with taking $30 off of the bill. Shouldn't it be protocal for the manager to take down my boyfriend's information and make a formal report? None of this was done and we were left at the table with just the bill and no dessert.  I would think that such a big corporation would want to exceed in customer service and want for their customers to return. Maybe acknowledging that something did happen and offering just something for my boyfriend to return to the restaurant would have been nice. Mike did not even thank us for choosing to eat at Friday's and did not mention that he would like for us to return. A voucher for something for my boyfriend to return or his information so that someone could follow up on the situation would have made us feel that Friday's really does care about their customers. Unless this matter is taken seriously by Friday's management and corporation, my family and friends will not be dining at Fridays any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-torrance?start=280,1.96,1.96,1.96,2.052,1.96

The lunch hour was not too busy when I arrived. The hostess was friendly and seated me by the window. When I mentioned the coupon, the waitress was very friendly and said ""Anything you like!"" So I ordered baby back ribs and fried shrimp, along a baked potato skin.  The ribs were actually very tender and flavorful. Fried shrimp were crunchy and not bready at all. There could be more toppings on the potato skin but I could not complain much because I was stuffed. I'd say my first time at TGIF was pleasant, nothing too special, yet no disappointment, either.

295,Kelly S.,"Gardena, CA",0,17,,1.0,2012-04-18,"Crap crap crappy!  I'm not sure what made us come here, but we're sure the heck NEVER coming back. Food:  sub-par.  I'm preggos so i ordered my steak medium-well, which came out bloody pink in the middle.  How come i can't get it that pink when i order medium-rare, i'll never figure it out.  Maybe its because in places like this the cooks arent trained properly because they're disposable.  Same goes for the wait staff, lazy and mediocre.  The waiter actually passed our entrees through the railing from the bar area instead of walking up two steps to place it properly in front of us. Aaand, coleslaw was warm.  Not room temp, WARM like it had been sitting at the pass waiting for the rest of the food to be made. Lastly, the busboy hovered waiting for us to leave.  I boxed up my steak, planning on cooking it a little longer at home and DUH, i walked away from the table without grabbing the box.  Again, i'm preggos and forgetful.  When i went back 30 seconds later, the busboy who WATCHED US walk away from the table, had tossed my box in his dishbin instead of walking 10 feet after us....i said, ""aww, you tossed my steak."" The stupid kid said, ""it's right there if you want it."" It was sitting in about an inch of water and soda in a nasty bucket.  I replied, ""um, do i want that now?"" The kid said, ""i dont know, do you?"" I wanted to slap him.  Instead i recounted this to the manager, who NEVER apologized, never asked WHO was rude, and looked a bit amused.  He DID offer another steak, which is how you solve problems there, by throwing meat at it.  I just looked at the guy like, wtf?  He just wanted to go back to flirting with the hostess.

The dinning environment is not good, the table is sticky, so is the floor. And the waitress just doing nothing but standing together at the front desk laughing and gossiping.

291,Jadelady Y.,"Torrance, CA",44,133,46.0,1.0,2012-06-15,"This is the worst chain of TGI Fridays I have ever been to and the sad part is, I've been here before!! And had good food! I don't know what happened to this place, but the quality has gone waaay down at this branch. TGI Fridays is supposed to be known for their steaks. I've had my own family members order the Jack Daniel's Flat Iron Steak and say it was good. So, in celebration of my brother's birthday, I don't if it was because they were understaffed tonight or what, but the waiter got my brother's beer order wrong twice. When we ordered our food, it took over 1/2 hour to finally get our food!!  I ordered a steak for myself. WORST DECISION I EVER MADE. I ordered the Jack Daniels Flat Iron Steak rare. What did I get?? I got a RAW steak.I sent it back and when it came back 10 minutes later, I discovered it had been placed in the oven and the inside was barely discernably better than raw. My brother ordered the Tuscan Pasta shrimp. The shrimp on skewers looked like they had been sitting on the plate long enough to give the appearance of dryness. Another family member had pork chops with some fried onion rings sitting on top of the pork chops and by the time the plate got to our table, the onion rings had gone somewhat limp and soggy looking from sitting on top of the pork chop for so long. NOT GOOD. This place does not deserve another trip here from me again. I have to say they were busy tonight, but that does not excuse the poor shape of the food we ate today. Whoever the chef is back there does not know what they're doing. If you have a neighborhood TGI Fridays in your area and is decent, than stay at that one This one is not worth it. You're better off cooking your own at home compared to this place",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-torrance?start=280,2.24,2.24,2.24,1.7640000000000002,2.24

At the risk of being laughed at, here is the funny short story for your entertainment, and as a warning to stay away from this terrible place. My friends and I were all having some drinks and waiting for dinner.  The girls were having their over-priced, over-sized, over-sugared cups and me a beer, which I finished. The waiter came over and said since it's my birthday I should have a ""waterfall.""  I said okay.  A few minutes later he came back and stood next to me at the head of the table and said that my drink was on its way.  But before I got it, I had to say, ""waterfall, waterfall, waterfall.""  So I did. Waterfall, waterfall, waterfall! Then the waiter dumped a pitcher of ice water over my head, soaking me and my shirt. As a former Kenpo tournament fighter, I jumped out of my chair and considered a waterfall of fists to the waiter's face.  Instead my good senses of not wanting to be arrested kicked in.  I took off my shirt and threw it on the floor. The waiter then told me to lighten up, that it was just a joke.  I told him to get me a f*cking towel and a very nervous girl brought me one.  I wiped off as the waiter laughed.  I decided to take the high road here, and simply picked up my shirt and walked out. TGI Fridays, I will never go back to any of your restaurants.  I will continue to tell this story.  I will watch as your business, which does not respect customers fails.   Cheers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-torrance?start=220,2.2,2.2,2.2,1.7320000000000002,2.2

I highly recommend the pulled pork sandwich.

The waiter tried to bring us Strawberry Lemonades we never ordered twice. He had forgotten to bring my sister's tacos and said he would do so right away. Then our table was forgotten. Our drinks were never refilled and he didn't come back until maybe another 15 minutes later empty handed. We asked about the tacos again but he blamed the kitchen claiming he had no idea why they were taking so long. He disappears for another 5 minutes and when we look down the hall he was chatting with some other female waiters. He finally noticed us and brought out my sisters tacos in a minute (I guess it was the kitchen's fault, according to our waiter.....) While he was taking out plates away he told us he had the bill in his hand (we were expecting the bill) and said he'd give it to us. But he just took our plates away and didn't give us the bill. When he finally came back with it again we found that we were charged for the Strawberry Lemonades we never ordered instead of our regular Lemonades. We pointed it out and he told us it wasn't a big deal since it was just an extra 60¢... The nerve of this guy. My dad looked like he was about to explode in rage so I guess he got scared and ran off to make the changes.

We had reservations at 8 p.m. and we all got there and our table was ready right away. We had 2 hosts serving us throughout the evening. They were on top of it with food orders and keeping the drinks coming. I had the parmigiana crusted chicken which was o-kay. I've had better, but i liked that it came with a tomato and mozzarella salad on the side. Beef had the rib eye and chicken with the Jack Daniel's dipping sauce (soooo good!) We shared the vanilla cheesecake drizzled with chocolate syrup, also yummy. I had 2 drinks- one was the Ultimate 77 Sunset strip which was good but a little too sweet. The second was the Georgia Peach Tea. I love me some schnapps and this drink was perfect for me. I even got a little buzz going. Beef got some snobby sipping whiskey and the name escapes me at the moment. The service was great, but we were shocked when we received our portion of the bill. To help us out, they split the bill by seats and partners and our bill came out much higher than we thought it would be! They added gratuity to the bill which came out to be an extra $10 per couple. We did not tip because of this being included in our bill. TGIF is a good social bar/grill restaurant for friends. Not somewhere we would go and eat if it was just the two of us.

First of all, it took the waitress 20 minutes before she even came to take our order. It wasn't that busy either. Then she finally brought our food out and it looked inedible. My Jack Daniel's ribs were dried out and appeared to be burnt. They were too tough to eat so I had the waitress take it back. I switched to the Salmon. My wife order the Friday's shrimp and oh what a sight! They were small and drenched in oil. She couldn't eat anymore because she said biting into the grease was making her nauseous,  Once they brought my salmon, I ate half and have the other half to my wife.

Bf has been puking since 5am, it is the worst food poisoning we've ever seen, might go to ER if it doesn't stop in an hour! We know their food is the cause b/c we were so busy yesterday all we had were a donut each & dinner here. I read through some of the reviews and this is the 3rd food poisoning just here on yelp, prolly more that aren't mentioned here, the place is gross and staff irresponsible. Service sucks! Food was cold/sat too long, bland.  managers were nice. 0 stars if possible. There is the short gist of it.  Here is a more in depth explanation as to why this place deserves no stars and HOW my bf got sick, also the few good points if you're interested. Us: servers, long time in food indus. So understanding/easy to please, big tippers. Our experience at TGI Fridays in Torrance: Time of visit: 9:30ish pm Thursday 12/12/13. From what we could see at night our first impression was good, large parking lot, landscaping & outdoor fountains were nice. The place has great potential, too bad that initial impression didn't last. The entrance was deserted, the 1st employees we saw were in the back leaning and talking. No hostess around, once we found 1 we were seated quickly. Server: Sonia -10 min for initial greeting/drink orders. Drinks were brought in ok time. -when we asked for more time (1st time there) it took almost 15 min. for our order to be taken by the manager, server greeted/took orders for 2 nearby tables w/out looking at us 1ce in this time -10 min for side of ranch for app. that bus boy eventually got, same w/refilla except we waited 15-20 for those -mngr took and brought every order except dessert -server checked on us 1 time only & never brought napkins we asked for -45 min for simple entrees...the plates were burning hot but food was cold, that's a telltale sign it sat too long under heat lamps. We had time sensitive chicken/shrimp THIS is where bf got SICK, it was ill prepared and sat too long. she was nowhere in sight most of our meal, other tbls were impatient and 1 guy actually walked around looking for her to no avail. No friendliness or apologies, she needs both serving and service training. Food: my chicken was cold & dry had to use leftover pasta sauce to make edible, pasta cold and sticky. Bfs pasta was cold, sauce was congealed, shrimp/chicken cold. He didn't eat much of it and boxed the rest (thankfully he didn't touch the leftovers later) Dessert was good, vanilla bean chscake was awesome, app (flatbread) and dessert was best part of the meal. the manager melissa was nice & friendly, so wasthe busboy. When I called and spoke to Pia (other mngr) she was also nice, and was concerned about the food poisoning. She said she would tell her staff at their meeting tonight about it, but offered no other actions to prevent this from happening to some1 else, nor did she offer an incentive to come back (not that I would, or was looking for a freebie), this is normal protocol, you should also ask for customers info to check back on them.

When we got our entrees, nothing was even hot! Our food was barely warm because laughing and talking is more important than her ONLY table.

I've learned that the bar menu is actually really good (Ice cold beers on tap as well), and if you're going there on a date you can't go wrong with their pastas.  The food isn't 'bad,' it's just not something to write home about.  If you really want to get something GOOD expect to pay a bit more for it.  The ribs are very good. The chicken and shrimp pasta is my favorite!  But I only really look forward to going if I'm going with the bros. Then I don't mind getting a cold beer and some sliders.

Im new to yelp so im a review this place because i had a bad experience from the food 3 years ago. its was so bad that i ended up in the hospital. my and me wife liked this place we used to eat there 2 amonth sometimes more. So this one day we decided to eat and i got my ribs as usual and my wife got the jack danields chicken brest with shrimp. When we got our food we noticed something different it seemed like it was heated on the microwave. It didnt seemed fresh. So my wofe ate her chicken while i was taking care of the baby, that day he a bit cranky. So she finished and i decided to take my food to go because the baby wouldnt stop crying. So we got home and i decided to eat one rib because it was late and i didnt want to have a heavy meal at night so i decided to take my ribs for lunch the follwing day. The following day at work my wife calls me to tell me that she woke up with a high fever but no other symptoms.  I told her that if she felt any worse to call me so i could go home and take her to the doctor. And hour later i called to ask if she was feeling better and she said yea that the fever had gone away and she had no other symptoms.  So i said ok let me have my lunch i  peace now. I wate like around noon. And around 130 i started feeling hot. Then i started feeling a little nausea.  By 3 pm i had to go home because i couldnt stop vomitting and i had a high fever. So i got home and i could stop vomitting so i decided to go to the ER. after test the docs told me i had a sever case of food poisoning.  The food i ate was spoiled or contaminated with something. im sure it was the food from here.

184,Gina W.,"Torrance, CA",3,59,,2.0,2014-03-12,"This review is for their takeout service. I ordered two grilled chicken chopped salads to go for lunch. On the phone they asked if I wanted the dinner or lunch size and I said lunch. When I got to my desk and opened my salad I was pretty annoyed. Yes, it is a lunch salad and $6.99, but there was very little food in the container. On top of the chopped romaine lettuce were: two over-cooked HALF pieces of bacon, two slices of grilled chicken, half a small avocado, half a very small boiled egg, four tiny cherry tomato halves and a tiny sprinkle of blue cheese. And the ingredients were just thrown on top of the lettuce. I've never seen anything so pathetic.  I could have gotten this at Quizno's if I wanted so little. I'll be hungry again in a hour. And, because I'm annoyed right now, I'll add - this is supposed to be a ""chopped"" salad. The ingredients are usually chopped - including the meat and bacon. I had to chop my chopped salad myself, LOL.  The service was fast and the staff is nice. But if they're going to do takeout, they shouldn't treat it so poorly - someone is still looking at the presentation and someone is still eating the food.

The waiters and waitresses were very inattentive and didn't seem to care in the slightest about delivering good service. On one visits, I ordered a Jack Daniel's burger with ""no pink."" Some places the meat/burger temperature varies - medium well vs. well done, so I try to make it simple by just saying ""no pink."" When I received my burger, it was extremely burnt and tasted like I was eating a piece of charcoal. I sent it back, only to get a burger burnt in the same manner. I don't think anyone would be pleased with a burnt burger.... but they had no problem serving it me that way twice. The second time I came, I was pleased by only one thing - the Happy Hour drink I ordered. Their blue raspberry margarita was AMAZING - great flavor and a nice amount of alcohol, but not too strong. Plus, it being $5 was an added bonus! The rest of the dining experience that night was lackluster. We had a very rude server who took many of our plates before we were finished and constantly rushed us. And once again, the food was just average, nothing special, nothing that would make us eager to come back. I probably won't be coming back here unless its for their Happy Hour.

Also got the spinach artichoke dip, got the dip before the chips and the waiter said he was waiting on a fresh batch of chips, but the chips were very stale to me and seemed as if they put old chips into a deep fryer just to warm them up.

Thought I would give it another try as I remember years ago this place use to be pretty good--drinks and food. Came in for happy hour Tuesday and was quite surprised there were only a couple people in the place @ 5:30. I'm pretty sure I know why now. This place has literally taken a nose dive!!  The drinks were terrible (nothing like they use to be). The appetizers were disgusting. Was going to order an entree but didn't dare. Also the booths were probably the same ones I sat in in the early 90's when I use to frequent this place. I was literally sitting on a vinyl covered 2x4. No discernable padding whatsoever.

102,Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782.0,3.0,2014-12-20,"My first TGI Friday's experience was on a Saturday after work. I was tired, hungry and ready for some good food. This location in particular was pretty close to an Olive Garden, so I was hoping that, even though my boyfriend and I were headed to the restaurant during prime dinner hour (6:30 p.m.), that more people would be flocking to the home of unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks than to Friday's.   We ended up waiting about 20 minutes to be seated--not as bad as it could be, for a weekend--and the inside of the restaurant was definitely noisy. Because we were only a party of two, we were squeezed into one of the smaller tables in between all the larger parties.   There's a great selection on the TGI Friday's menu (and if you go during Happy Hour or on Fridays, there's better deals, of course). I had an overall good experience, as the appetizer we ordered was delicious, and I couldn't have enjoyed my meal and dessert more. I think our dessert was the highlight of the meal (more on that below). I can't remember what my boyfriend ordered, but here are some of our selections from the night, as well as some of the entrees I was considering and will probably try on a future visit:   ""Loaded Potato Skins"": I love baked potatoes, but I also love their sister food - crispy, loaded potato skins. This appetizer features crispy potato skins topped with melted cheddar and crispy applewood smoked bacon, and is served with green onion sour cream. I enjoyed my potato skins perfectly fine without the sour cream. Each skin was nice and crispy, covered with the oozing, melted cheddar. The crispy bacon pieces provided additional crunch and flavor, and though this appetizer was greasy, it was extremely savory and helped to stave off my hunger until my entrée came.   ""Bacon Mac & Cheese Bites"": I'm a sucker for anything that involves mac & cheese, and when you add bacon to the mix ... well, bacon really does make most things better. I haven't tried this dish (under the ""Taste and Share"" section of the menu), but it sounds mouthwatering. This small plate includes crispy bites filled with three varieties of Cheddar and is served with a craft beer cheese dipping sauce. Each order comes with only four balls, so if you're a mac & cheese fanatic, you might want to get more than one order (unless you're set on not sharing).   ""Sizzling Chicken & Cheese"": The entrée I ordered on my first trip to TGI Friday's tasted as flavorful and delicious as it sounds. It comprised garlic-marinated, all-natural chicken breast served over melted cheese with onions and peppers and served with creamy mashed potatoes. I ordered my entrée without the onions and peppers, but the chicken had enough taste with its garlic flavor and all the cheese. I was happy to see that they did not skimp on the cheese, either. The mashed potatoes were light and fluffy and the perfect accompaniment to the cheesy chicken.   ""Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie"": During my first and only visit to TGI Friday's, I did have the chance to try this dessert, and it was absolutely phenomenal. This dessert features chocolate ganache layered with peanut butter mousse in a peanut butter graham cracker crust. It's topped off with whipped cream and a peanut butter cup. When I ordered this dessert, I got it sans the whipped topping (but with the peanut butter cup), and it was amazing. I usually don't like mousse, but for peanut butter, I'll always make an exception. The dessert was a creamy blend of both chocolate and peanut butter, and the peanut butter graham cracker crust was delectably unique.   ""Brownie Obsession"": I love cookies and brownies, so if it weren't for the ""Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie"" that was on the menu, I probably would have gone with this dessert. This sweet treat features a warm, chocolate fudge brownie topped with vanilla ice cream, pecans and Ghirardelli caramel sauce. Though this brownie dessert sounds pretty standard, I don't need anything super fancy. If it simply involves a moist brownie, ice cream and lots of good chocolate, I'm happy.   ""Oreo Madness"": There are so many choices on the dessert menu that it's hard to settle on just one. I have to admit, I paid some attention to this classic cookies and cream dessert, even when I had settled on the ""Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie"" as my choice. This decadent delight includes Cookies 'n Cream ice cream sandwiched between layers of an Oreo cookie crust and garnished with Ghirardelli chocolate sauce. Yummmmmy. This dessert is truly a cookie lover's ultimate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-torrance?start=100,2.84,2.36,2.36,1.804,2.552

My wife apologized for failing to mention that beforehand, but the waitress was visibly agitated and her entire demeanor changed. She brought the food, but didn't say anything after that... wouldn't visit anymore nor would she talk to her like she first did either. She was playing 20 questions in regards to our marriage and was excited for us and all that stuff servers do to butter you up for good tips, but she wouldn't really even acknowledge us anymore after the order mistake. She took the silverware with the plate as well so I had to find her to ask for a refill on my coffee and for new silverware... which agitated her more. So we didn't want to order anything else just to prevent her from having to talk to us anymore. She also added that $1.99 game bill on the little tablets on their table that we never asked for.

A dash of Tabasco sauce even livened up the meatiness of the  pork ribs a bit.   The Coleslaw with julienned apples actually tasted fresh, crisp, with the right amount of sweet vinegar dressing. None of that heavy mayonnaise, soggy. limped out, tired mess. The Mac & Cheese was made of al dente Penne pasta that looks like Mostaccioli with fine parallel ridges going lengthwise along the pasta which was fine. But the mac & cheese was overly dry with a hardened crusty, oily yet bland cheese. The cooks making this should taste their own cooking as punishment for such dismal fare.  (I'm taking this home and doctoring it up with sautéed garlic, onions, bacon, cream, touch of cognac, shavings of Parmigiana Reggiana and then adding a bit of Black Truffle Oil at the end to add that acidic, woodsy, fermenting humus mushroom bouquet.)   Ice Tea was the preferred pairing. I was most impressed with our waiter whose name might be Mark, short dark brown hair cut, about 5'8"", trim looking college student material.  He was most pleasant, and served out the food as fast as it came out to our large group.  Then he provided us with a list of what we had ordered, and all we had to do was tick off what we had ordered so that he could go to the trouble of calculating individual checks. Such a nice guy volunteering to go to all that trouble with a smile at 11 o'clock at night.  3-- Yelp stars for the food, but 5 Yelp star service.  Thanks for the nice, enthusiastic service. PS  I went to the Simi Valley branch years ago after theatre, and I find that some of their mixed drinks are fine.  I had one that looked like an alcoholic version of a strawberry ice cream parfait that really tasted great for dessert.

I pressed the ""call server"" button no one came. Then finally our appetizers came out with another waitress. Another hour passed, it took the waiter another 45 minutes or maybe longer just to ask us what we wanted to get for entrees she then had the same excuse of being held back, again there is barely anyone at the restaurant. But when we asked for our dessert to go and some boxes it took her only 2 seconds to get them. I would never want to be going to a poor customer service place like this again it took 3 hours just to wait our tables. My food didn't taste so great and my friends food didn't taste that great either along with the martini she order it was really really strong and awful. I honestly wouldn't come back to this restaurant, poor service, lack of seeing what the customers need, rude, reasons why I gave them one star if only I can give them none.

Of course some are better than others and for different reason. I love the one in view park for socializing and drinks well... actually, the food is above average as well (for a TGIF) so pretty much everything.... except..... the wait. So... at-least from my experience this one rarely gets too crowded we went in with a party of four on a Saturday at around 4:30 and was able to be seated in less than 5 minutes and though there were a lot of empty tables( so the 5 minute wait must of been from under staffing) our waitress seemed flustered until I asked her was she having a bad day and then she changed her tune a bit. I had the Jack Daniel's sirloin steak w/ mashed potatoes and mac n cheese yes, I skipped the veggies... for fear that they would come out soggy and I like mines steamed just a bit or sautéed with butter and garlic, plus I just really just wanted both, the other orders were the bruschetta chicken pasta and the fire (something) salmon. ALL of the meats came out way to done and a bit dry. I was surprised how well done my sirloin came out, since when I use to order it this way the chef seem to think I meant other wise and left some pink as if it was better for me or something... but, now I'm learning better and the reasoning behind it. My sauce was a bit on the sweet side for my taste and I didn't like the dry bird crumbs.. I mean bread crumbs on the mac n cheese to me it was like a gourmet Kraft mac n cheese and it didn't come in the cast iron skillet like it was suppose to, though the waitress said I got more because of it. Everyone did eat all of there food so I guess it was good enough but definitely could have ben better. My bf did get the veggies and they were surprisingly fresh and crisp looking so next time lol. I normally get there spinach dip and breadsticks which I've always enjoyed Thank god I didn't we vouched for the Brownie sundae instead. all in all like the rating everything was just A-OK who knows if the meat was had a bit more Love maybe this would have gone up half a star or so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-torrance?start=200,2.48,2.32,2.32,1.868,2.384

Like lukewarm soup hot. The ribs were super super dry w/ sauce thrown on the top only and the lobster was slightly over cooked...good flavor but extremelyyyyyyy salty. Mac and cheese was good minus the 2 tablespoons of bread crumbs they tossed on top. Also tried some of my friends spinach dip.... It was alright.

There are actually two options that you can choose from for all you can eat appetizers. It's either $10 for all you can eat of the same appetizer or $12 for all you can eat of several on their list. We chose the $12 option and I have to say that this is definitely the right thing to do. The appetizers were pretty good for a chain restaurant. The restaurant was pretty full when we arrived (It was about 6pm) but we did not have to wait at all. The service was decently fast and nice. The restaurant shares a very large parking lot with other places, but it seems to be pretty easy to find a spot (we did not have any problem).

When the waitress brought it, my husband and I began to eat it and after digging to the bottom, noticed there was no Poundcake. When the waitress came to give us our bill, my husband told her that the dessert had no Poundcake and that we didn't want it anymore. She asked if we at least enjoyed the Ice cream and my husband said yes it was good but I ordered the dessert for the Poundcake. She said sorry and left us the bill...the bill that charged us $6 for a Poundcake and ice cream. When she came back to pick up the bill my husband told her we were not going to pay $6, but we'd pay for half since we got half the dessert. She said she understood and took back the bill and removed the charge.

I ordered a bruschetta chicken pasta and shared chips and salsa as an appetizer. It was surprisingly really yummy! I really liked how the pasta had a spicy kick to it and the chicken was grilled. The portion was pretty large that I had to take at least half of it home. It could have also been the appetizer beforehand.

Apparently, some female hostess' in this TGI Fridays only want to give certain services to certain customers. I wish I had caught the girls name, but I was too busy drinking and TRYING to talk to my boyfriend. And he was too busy distracting me from her rudeness. From the moment we walked in at about 8:45pm the hostess was irrititating. She was so excited my bf held the door open for me, and she said it was very nice of him blah blah blah. Well, that's what real men do! Then we are standing at the podium for literally another 3 to 4 minutes while she tells us that she has been single for a long time and that her family thinks she should find someone. And then she tells us about a table that came in earlier, and the girl sat on the wrong side of the booth and the guy made her get up. I said, ""Aww, that's right!"" She said ""what was he thinking""? Time out: Ladies your man should always sit where he can see the door. That's how he protects you. And making you walk on the inside of the sidewalk doesn't mean he's trying to control you either. So, at this point we're looking at each other like ,""b*****, shut up"". I'm ready to go already and finally, we get seated.  We order drinks and we're both trying to de-stress. Our waitress just left with the order...What's this I see? Hostess! ""Is everything ok?"" no eye contact with me. I say pretty loud, ""We're good""! Then she turns to him and asks ""how long have you guys been dating?"" Not that that's her business. So he says, ""several...months, and we talked for a long time before that."" None of which is true. lol. So she leaves, we get drinks, and eventually I order fries. Then she comes back to the table and the table next to us is staring, and I'm staring at them. And I'm making eye contact with the girl in the next booth like ,""Is this broad serious""?  She chimes in with her, ""is everything ok""?  If It wasn't I would have told the other two servers who were here 3 seconds before you came.  Then she again talks only to my bf, and he's staring at the me the whole time, and I'm in that mode, giving him the look like ""this is not gonna happen again.  you need to get her away from the table, or she's crawling away from it."" Well she starts asking him where he grew up and tells him where she grew up. Ask him what is his nationality, and she says that she is Peruvian. Am I'm thinking to myself, ""If you don't get away from this table you finna find out how black I am, B**** cuz you testing me."" Soon as she see's me staring at her. She leaves. Then my bf goes, ""what the f*** is wrong with her?"" And ask me to sit next to him. At that point I was ready to go. We talked for a little bit and since I was sitting closest to the aisle, I guess she never came back or she got the hint with the little PDA we pulled while waiting for the check.  I give our server a 5, you are awesome and I loved the two-toned red, blonde hair. I never had to wonder where you'd gone. That's why there are 2 stars instead of one.

I have been here a few times and service has always been great and on this visit our waiter provided exceptional service. All the food was good, but I will say the macaroni and cheese as well as the strawberry passion tea only deserve four stars. The tea was just ok and the macaroni was good I could just do without the breaded topping cooked on top. Now everything else was great. Chicken and shrimp Cajun pasta, shrimp was cooked perfectly, great flavor with just a little kick of Cajun spice. Tennessee baby back ribs, pull apart tender, great sweet bbq taste. Sweet potato fries crispy and good. Potstickers lightly seared and packed with flavor. I love the pretzel sticks that come with craft beer cheese dipping sauce with applewood bacon and green onions, yum yum, they were my favorite. And to top off the meal we had the Tennessee whiskey cake, a toffee cake with roasted pecans and butterscotch Jack Daniels sauce with a scoop of ice cream, absolutely fantastic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-torrance?start=100,2.12,2.18,2.18,2.356,2.156

I'm giving this review three stars because each visit here weren't completely terrible, but it was my last visit that kind of did it for me. So, me and some co-workers decide to go grab some drinks after work on a late Thursday night and chose this location. Called ahead of time to get a confirmation as to what time they last call would be and was told that last call would be around 12:15, so we headed over. We arrived at around 11:40pm, mind you that is 35 minutes before they said last call was, an were greeted by the hostess who addressed to us that last call for food and drinks is at 12. The hostess repeated that about three times as if he did not want us to stay, but we told him that we knew what we wanted and would order right away. We sat down and we immediately put our orders in, but after shortly taking our orders the waiter stated that he will be leaving at 12:30 and needs to close out the tab. This guy wanted us in and out of there without no hesitation. Overall, we felt rushed and unwanted by this server. There was no customer service whatsoever!

130,Michael C.,"Castaic, CA",357,66,2.0,1.0,2016-02-09,"I did not enjoy my time here at all!  My girlfriend and I got a gift card to for TGI Friday's and I figured I would just take her here for dinner. Thinking it would be nice because of the location, I was immediately thrown off by how small it looked in there and the seating looked uncomfortable. We got the seats thats right by the refreshment machine so all I could hear literally when I sat down was the ice hitting the cups right behind me. The table was sort of sticky as if someone rushed wiping it down. The waitress was also very impatient, she was not very nice and I will admit I am very undecisive, but she could have been a bit more nicer with her tone. She took my girlfriends order and when I took a little while, she said ""do you guys want me to give you five or ten minutes"" in a straight annoyed tone.  I know she is human too, but in this line of work, you can't be ride like that. I went ahead and ordered the wings. When we received the food, the wings were very small and they were pretty dry. If I paid full price (I got military discount) I would have been extremely upset. The wings honestly taste worse than the ones you get at the store in the frozen section, only difference were that they were crispier but less tasteful. My girlfriends burger was decent, but pretty small. The whole experience here felt uncomfortable and rushed, I felt like I just wanted to eat and get up out of there. I can't believe how packed this location gets. I also mentioned it was my girlfriends birthday and she asked me to make sure as if I wasn't truthful. So after that, she brings us ice cream in a little cup. Me and my girlfriend was going to leave a $5 tip but what happened next made us tip less than that. We paid with the gift card and she charges us but keeps the gift card??? I am not sure what she is trying to pull, but she honestly could have gotten away stealing our gift card money and there isn't really a way to trace that! I honestly think she should be fired, I hate that I don't know her name because my girlfriend left the receipts at the table because she was so mad. I am not sure why she would forget to do that. I told the manager or shift supervisor about the lady not returning our gift card and he looked pretty upset. About three minutes later he brought it back to us, I was a bit upset she didn't at least bring it herself and apologize. She even walked past our table without saying anything! I remember when we left, I saw the manager questioning her about the card (he clearly looked unhappy)... I could just hear her say she forgot, she shouldn't be forgetting things like that, what if it was a credit card! She is lucky we weren't going crazy about this, we just left only to hear more people in the parking lot complaining about the service they got. Yes, its that bad! If you want to know how she looks, she is latina, has glasses, and works on the right side of the restaurant on Thursday nights around 7pm. I was also mad we didn't even get happy hour pricing despite being sat down right before 7pm hit, even the waitress saying most people like appetizers during happy hour and they had just had it and its over. What a horrible experience. Don't eat at this restaurant. Maybe I will have a better experience the next time I come smh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-torrance?start=140,1.96,2.22,2.22,2.084,2.116

Apparently, TGI Fridays has unlimited appetizers (AYCE) which is perfect for such an occasion.  For $12 a person, you can get as many appetizers you want (from their select menu).  There is a catch.  You can only get 3 appetizers per person at a time.  And, you cannot take home any left overs.   The AYCE menu were FULL size orders of: - Boneless wings with tons of sauces to choose from - Cheesesticks  - Pot stickers  - Crispy green beans - Loaded potato skins - Braised BBQ Beef tostadas - Tuscan spinach dip and BBQ Chicken flatbread We started off with 7 items, 3 wings, cheesesticks, pot stickers, potato skins, tostadas.  Stella was great... Since we were only able to get 3 apps at a time, she first keyed in 3 orders, waited and keyed in the balance a short time later.  Not only did we get the food in an orderly fashion, it also helped us clear the table when the 2nd wave of food came.   We tried all except the spinach dip and flatbread.  For the wings, we tried BBQ, Buffalo, and PB and J... that's right, peanut butter and jelly.  It was... different.  I personally wouldn't order it again.   Our favorites were the pot stickers (we ordered it 2x!), the cheesesticks, green beans, and the BBQ boneless wings. I was amazed how yummy the greenbeans were. They reminded me of fried zucchini sticks. Actually any fried veggie is good, so what am I saying? The ones we did not like was the PB and J and the Tostadas.  The sauce was just too sweet, and then the habanero sauce kicks in, making it too spicy. Not a good balance for our group. The loaded potato skins were ok but the cheese wasn't melted, and the skins were a bit cold.  We could have sent it back, but I thought we'd order more later.  Unfortunately we were quite full after eating 9 plates of food. Thumbs up to the AYCE appetizers.  You have to ask for the menu. They didn't offer it to us until we asked.  It seems they try to push the $4 appetizers in the back of the menu, as its 1/2 orders, smaller portions, and definitely not AYCE.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-torrance?start=20,2.32,2.32,2.24,2.576,2.32

We order appetizers today which were okay, but the chicken wings were   deformed looking and cold. My Fiancé is way more reasonable and simple with his food and he even wasn't impressed. The Cajun Shrimp and Chicken pasta was out right disgusting. It had no flavor or seasoning and the cream sauce seriously taste like the chef poored it straight from the glass jar it came from.  We sat in the bar, and even that experience was lame. The bartender had his regulars so he pretty much catered to them. And when we asked for items that we were already supposed to have. He came off as being socially awkward, I was over it today.  This review isn't me complaining but, to bring to your attention that the employees are comfortable.

I was reminded when I walked in and then first opened the menu that if you've been to one TGIF you've sort of been to them all. Of course there will be some differences from location to location but there is more in common. I tried to order a non-alcoholic beer. My server, Amber, said they were out of their normal choice but that the bar recommended Barritts as an alternative. I've never heard of them but went ahead and ordered it. It turned out that Barritts is a Ginger Beer, with water and high-fructose corn sugar as first two listed ingredients. I tried a couple of sips and it tasted like a sweet ginger beer, nothing at all like a beer. Credit should go to Amber because she noticed that I hadn't taken more than a couple of sips and without me asking her she deducted the soda from my bill. I hope that whoever works the bar learns to make better recommendations. I started with the New England Clam Chowder. Its OK but I would have preferred that it have less onion, and more cream and/or potato. My entree was the Grilled Salmon. I know that at a corporate chain I'm not going to get fresh fish but frozen and resurrected can be fine. It was grilled but not quite to the extent that it would be blackened. It was a little dry tasting but good. The default sides of rice pilaf and steamed spinach were both good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-torrance,2.92,2.54,2.392,1.9960000000000002,2.692

However the last three visits I ordered this meal and each time the baked potato was a day old. Which I'm certain they'd deny that, but one would guess that at 3 pm the spuds would be freshly baked. This has happened now three visits in a row at approximately the same time (around 3 ish) you might question how I would know it was a day old? Well the skin was completely separated in parts from the potato and the was also very hard and dark in color - it's hard to describe but let's just say what it wasn't -a freshly baked potato!! Now in to the lobster, I asked for steamed (not grilled) it was almost a beige color and all they did to cover up an old lobster was sprinkle a ton of season salt to mask the poor lobster!  Now, I realize it's only $15 but cmon now !!! At least give me something fresh. Will I go back? Probably...But don't lure us in for a great deal and then serve us sub par food.

They were desperately extending the happy hour time to increase the drink purchases but simultaneously the drinks were terrible and watered down so I only ordered the one then after I received the food I ordered the endless wings ( which at the time I wasn't told you can only get in boneless style), I clearly expressed that I wanted them traditional style before I ordered and was still brought boneless and was told (with an attitude) ""you can switch to regular price for traditional if you want""..but since it was in front of my face already I just said forget it (as I'm sure they expected) okay so one flavor which was the garlic parmesan was tasty and freshly made hot, the other flavor which was Buffalo felt like it had been sitting out for quite some time and wasn't even bothered to be heated up... also my girlfriends entree of JD chicken and  friedshrimp was terrible as well. The chicken was rubbery and You could tell by the black color of the shrimp tails that they had been frozen well past there shelf life...service wasn't the best either Just ultimately a very terrible experience and I will never visit this location again nor did I leave a tip. I put a big fat zero on that line in the receipt for a reason. Don't get me wrong I could never hold a TGI Fridays to a five star restaurant standards, but my service and food quality at this particular location was Far Below what I would even expect from a McDonald's for example.

We were in the restaurant for over an hour and a half to receive our food . The waitress forget item after item . We had to ask her multiple times to bring each thing . How can you eat without any drink at all? Maybe it was because she was the only waitress for half the restaurant !  The food was good , but maybe that's because it took forever to get there so after waiting an hour and half I was that much more hungry .  We left , went home and the next morning my brother and I had THE WORST food poisoning we have ever had , I puked at least 25 times over a 12 hour period , had a fever and still have diarrhea . Maybe the reason for the food taking so long was because the cook was also the dishwasher and wasn't washing his hands in between . Or maybe he was rushing because they were so understaffed that he was cutting my salad vegetables with a raw meat knife . Whatever it was it ultimately comes down to horrible management .  This restaurant is a disgrace . And I will never go to this location or any  TGI Friday's ever again . I had to stay home 2 days from work because of their negligence . Disgusting .

0,Nicole N.,"Torrance, CA",0,3,1.0,1.0,2017-12-28,"So I must let you guys know, this was by far the worst service. So we arrive and we're told it would be about a 35 minute wait. we finally come in and they take us a little sooner and we get seated. We order some appetizers and they did come out pretty good. We then ordered our food and it took almost 45-50 minutes to get our food to us. My mom, brother and his girlfriend ordered rib eyed steaks. My mom ordered it medium well and my brother ordered his medium. His girlfriend ordered it medium well also. So we patiently wait for our food understanding that it's Christmas Day and there's many people waiting on their food too. So we finally get the food and 2 major issues. The food was all cold and all rib eyed steak was made well done. Not tender whatsoever. Looked like a brick and also was burnt and well over cooked. Really frustrating because if we're going to wait almost an hour for our food at least it should be made as we asked it to be especially for how LONG we waited.. My brothers was the worst of them all because his steak was by far over cooked. He had to ask them to remake it and the rest of us decided to stay with our dish for the fact that it would only take another hour to get our food remade. I ordered the Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta. It was cold by the time I got it. So of course when our waiter came by to ask how everything was and that the steak would be out shortly, we informed her that everything was not okay the food was cold and our orders were not as we asked. She then says okay I'm sorry about that let me inform my manager. She eventually comes back informing us one appetizer would not be charged and one meal would not be Charged and when we receive the check it shows that they only didn't charge the rib eye which makes no sense because that's just one of the dishes on the plate not even the meal as they promised. We didn't ask that they subtract a meal and appetizer, they offered so don't promise something you won't fulfill. Because then they didn't even take off an appetizer and over all only took off one meal. With that being said, horrible experience. On top of all this.. as we were waiting for the steak to be remade, a waiter assisting the family behind us was informing them that a lot of customers orders were getting messed up and that the food is taking a while due to have to remake numerous customers orders again. So wouldn't you think if a few customers were having there orders messed up, you would try to make sure you don't mess up anymore orders for anyone else ??? Given the amount of time it's consuming and you guys would think they wouldn't want to lose business. Like clearly you guys do not care about your customers or your business to be consistently messing up everyone's orders ! Didn't even tip them it was by far the worst service go else where ! The T.G.I. Friday's in Downey was slightly better if you're gunna order anything from T.G.I. Friday's just get appetizers or anything that doesn't include meat. You'll be better off that way.
