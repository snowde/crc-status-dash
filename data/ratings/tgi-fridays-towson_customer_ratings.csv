89,Jude T.,"Parkville, MD",78,387,372.0,1.0,2012-05-04,"This Friday's location is piss-poor. I mean, sure, it's Friday's... There isn't much ti expect, usually... But I expect WAAAAY more than this place gives. Every time I've been here, the tables are either wet, sticky or wet AND sticky. I'm not sure how they are cleaning them, but it's not good! This location is always FAR too loud. The music is too loud, and the construction of the actual restaurant make conversations carry far too much... Which are louder than they need to be to begin with because the music is so loud! The wait staff here is hit-or-miss. Sometimes you get wonderful waiters (I do not differentiate between genders and use waiters as a gender-neutral term), and other times you get awful ones.  Last time I was here, I had a wonderful server who brought everything quickly, made sure everything was correct, and was wonderfully polite. My previous visit, however, was the complete opposite. I had a ""bonus bites"" card, which was worth $5. I gave it to the server. Apparently, it was not compatible with the ""2 for $20"" deal, and instead of informing me of this, he brought me our check with everything at full price and the $5 deducted from the end. I intended to ask him why that was, but it took SEVENTEEN MINUTES before he finally came back to our table. For 17 minutes, I watched him walk around to other tables in a far-off area and chat with customers, all the while waiting for him to come back. You'd think he'd want to come back and take the check, thinking we were paying? But nope, not this guy! Finally, he showed up and I asked him what was up. He informed me that the two were incompatible and that if I wanted, I could get the ""2 for $20"" price and not the $5 off. My girlfriend said ""Okay, that is fine, but you didn't tell us that"", and he actually had the nerve to reply ""I didn't tell you anything because you didn't ask."" What kinda server does that!? After he took the check, fixed it and came back he then said ""Oh, I guess you probably want your $5 card back, too. I guess I could go find the manager, it's just a lot of work trying to track him down."" What a lazy SOB! Needless to say, at that point, we decided his tip was 0%.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-towson?start=60,1.4440000000000002,1.4440000000000002,1.4440000000000002,1.4440000000000002,1.4440000000000004

100,Nicole M.,"Towson, MD",0,8,26.0,3.0,2013-01-09,"I went to this TGI Fridays location on Jan 9th, 2013 around 5:45pm. We were a party of 4 which included a very young child.  Service: Amazing! Our waiter was named Steve and he was so great. We were seated immediately upon arrival and Steve came over to grab our drink order. The hostess provided us with crayons and a drawing mat to keep the little one occupied. Steve was attentive, funny, and knowledgable about all the different food dishes and drink options. He was definitely the best part of the night. Highly recommend Steve! Food: I ordered the 2 for $10 with the Spinach Flatbread as my appetizer and the Garlic Shrimp & Rice as my entree. The Spinach Flatbread was okay. Nothing to rave about, just okay. The Garlic Shrimp & Rice was okay also. (See photos) The shrimp in the rice still had the tails on, which I thought was kinda strange? I went to take a bite of the shrimp and rice and bit into a tail. Yuck :P I'm not really sure why TGI Fridays decided it would be a good idea to leave the tails on in a rice entree. The Shrimp & Rice was brought out on a sizzling skillet which caused some of the cheese to become burnt and therefore inedible. But really, what can you expect from an entree that is part of a 2 for $10 deal? I'd be silly to expect anymore!! The other appetizers we got were the beefy Queso dip. I don't eat meat so I can't give my personal opinion on that but my sister enjoyed it. My dad got the Mozzarella Sticks and they were meh. Just like the frozen ones you can buy at the grocery store made by TGI Fridays frozen meal line.  My sister ordered the same entree as myself and she didn't like it at all. Just different taste buds I suppose :) My dad ordered the Angus burger and he liked it, although the fries that came with it were cold!! But again, you can't really expect amazingly wonderful cooked to perfection food when your buying items off of the 2 for $10 deal. Little brother got chicken tenders that again, looked like the frozen ones you buy from the grocery store but he's 3 and enjoyed 'em :) Overall, I'd recommend TGI Fridays if your looking for an inexpensive meal for a family outing. Don't expect amazing food cause you won't probably find that here. I had a great experience with our waiter and the overall service. The 3 stars are mainly for the awesome service we received!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-towson?start=60,1.6440000000000001,1.6440000000000001,1.6440000000000001,1.6440000000000001,1.6440000000000001

32,Al B.,"Baltimore, MD",4,13,,1.0,2013-03-20,"My wife and I wanted to celebrate our anniversary which fell on a Tuesday this year. So we resolved to go out to a casual, conveniently-located restaurant and then do the upscale celebration on the weekend when we were not so pressed for time. Going out for dinner twice in one week would be a real treat and would emphasize the auspiciousness of the milestone. Although Friday's seemed like it would fit the bill, it turned out to be a truly poor choice. I wish I had checked Yelp first as I normally would do. But Friday's is a national chain which has clearly been successful for many years so I figured it would have to be at least a 3-star casual restaurant. My appetizer, pot-stickers (fried Chinese dumplings), had a texture suggesting they were frozen in a half-fried state and then reheated prior to serving. The portion seemed ample as there were six dumplings on a nice, oblong plate. But some of the dumplings were virtually empty and the container for the dipping sauce was too small to readily dip the dumplings into. This lack of attention to detail is like when a restaurant puts black pepper into shakers with holes too small for the grains to fit through. You kind of wonder how management doesn't notice something so obviously out of proportion.  Both of us ordered Jack Daniels Angus burgers. The beef may have been Angus at some stage but it was like shoe leather by the time it was served to us. I've eaten at restaurants that are paranoid about being sued when someone becomes ill from bacteria in ground beef. But these burgers were not just overcooked - they had been brutally tortured as though the cook had some deep-seated anger at cows. We totally drenched the burgers in the Jack Daniels BBQ sauce but still found them tough and dry. Not wanting to ruin the vibe on our anniversary, I found the most gentle but definitive way of letting the waitress know about our dissatisfaction (not with her service but the burgers). She apologized but did not seem at all surprised at our complaint. It seemed she had heard this before. She went away, came back 10 minutes later and asked again if everything was OK. I asked her if the burger patties are pre-cooked and then reheated. She said she would check, came back after 10 minutes but did not answer the question. When pressed, she said the burger patties were cooked from a raw state and then offered to replace the burgers. This attempt at resolution came a good 25 minutes after our dissatisfaction was brought to her attention. I politely declined. At the end of the meal, she asked if I'd like to take my half-eaten burger home. ""Why would I want to do that?"", I asked.  Having been very polite to the waitress but clearly very dissatisfied, I thought the situation had elevated enough that the manager would soon be at our table. Wrong. Or perhaps the waitress would ""comp"" a couple of our drinks. Wrong again. Nada. An added insult when the bill arrived. Each of our glasses of unspecified ""red wine"" cost $8. That's a price I might expect for a house wine at a 4-star or above restaurant - but certainly not at a fern bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-towson?start=80,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001

The stupid separation of alcohol tax and regular tax threw me off as well. Tip wise I usually double the tax and it's typically on par with 20% but I didn't realize until after we left that it wasn't 20%. I came around 11 on 6/13 since Bahama Breeze closes all early. I had the Jack Daniels kickers which has been changed to the sesame Jack Daniels strips. Then ordered the tropical margarita. My friend had some berry Jack Daniels drink. Nope, didn't like it but mine was good. You can taste the passion fruit in it. His tasted like cough syrup to me but he liked it since he loves Jack Daniels. I also had the nasty Jack Daniels Tennessee toffee cake.

It wasn't that the food was that bad, my steak was more done than I wanted and the potato skins are greasy and not appetizing. But the fact that We sat in the bar at one of the tables and when we first walked in all the tables were dirty and obviously haven't been cleaned in a while. When someone does come to wipe a table down for us to sit at he asks for our Ids but then doesn't take our order or know any of the specials. It took probably ten minutes for our Tap beers to arrive and about other 15 for the food. The waiter stopped by the table when the food came but didn't return until our plates sat empty for about 20 minutes. It was not busy and there were three people working behind the bar. How long does it take to walk over to a table, one who's check is pretty high, to ask the customer for a refill. I work at a restaurant and this is just really depressing.

When we asked our server for some napkins, she nodded and walked away. Ten minutes later we stopped her and again asked for some napkins, which still hadn't arrived. Another ten minutes passed and we still didn't have our drinks. Finally when our drinks arrived, we asked for napkins, a third time. When our food finally arrived, a good fifteen minutes later (yes, we had to wait almost forty minutes to get our food), we had to ask for silverware, which seemed to really annoy the server. On top of that, she gave us the wrong food. She asked if everything looked good and we told her that the meals were incorrect. The attitude she had, made us just accept it because we couldn't wait another forty minutes for food. Five minutes later, she finally stopped by to give us our silverware. When the manager walked by and asked how our meal was, we let him know of the issues we were having. He smiled and asked if we wanted something free. No. We just want to finish up and leave.

Walked in at around 12:15 with a group of 7. Waitress let us know the kitchen was going to close shortly but my boo and I had a difficult time deciding what we wanted to eat.  She was very polite at and took our drink orders.  Five or so of us ordered water.  She brought us back our waters.... one by one.  We thought that was a little odd but we let it fly.

20,Shannon W.,"Baltimore, MD",1,1,,1.0,2014-11-12,"I came in here last night and had a less than stellar meal.  I should have known it was going to be crappy when the 2 hostesses that were working were nowhere to be found when we walked in.  It was 6:30pm and the place was not busy at all.  A guy who ended up being our server greeted us and when I said there would be 2 and asked for a booth he quickly responded with ok, one of the hostesses will be back to get you. When we were finally seated and ordered our drinks (a Dr. Pepper and Diet) the server comes back and says I'm not sure which is which, I switched hands.  Really?!?  In the 15 steps from the service well to the table you can't remember? We ordered the Cajun Chicken and Shrimp pasta with only shrimp and a Jack Daniels burger with Cheddar instead of provolone.  Also added a side of ranch and bbq.  The server quickly told me that if the sauces didn't come back he'd have to get them for me because ""the cooks don't look at the tickets.""  Well clearly that was the truth because my burger came out with provolone and the sauces weren't there.  I asked about the cheddar and he goes, ""well do you want me to bring out a piece of cheddar?""  No!  I ordered my burger the way I did because I don't care for provolone at all.  Aside from the burger, the plate came out with approximately 10 french fries - talk about skimping.  Normally places overload you to the point where you can't finish the heaping pile of fries they give you. When the check came there was an ""Open $$"" line for $2.49 on the bill.  When I asked the server about it, he said well you ordered only shrimp with your pasta so I rang that in for double shrimp.  If not you would've only had 6 shrimp.  Isn't this something a server would ask you about?  ""Sure, we can do that but if you don't add shrimp you'll get 6 and by the way, it's a $2.49 up charge.  Are you ok with that?""  Nope, never happened. I haven't been to a Fridays in years and this is probably why.  Less than stellar service and the food was nothing to write home about.  I'll stick to my local restaurants and give them my business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-towson?start=80,1.72,1.72,1.72,1.22,1.7200000000000002
88,Beth Anne H.,"Towson, MD",3,6,,1.0,2014-11-14,"Don't waste your time here. Wish I would have read the reviews first... Went for a friend's birthday with a party of 8 on a Tuesday around 9. Place wasn't busy at all. After being seated after 20 minutes, we got our drinks, and ordered our food- all appetizers. FORTY FIVE minutes later, ONE of the girls in our party gets a cup of soup (only half of what she ordered). No silverware- so we had to flag down a random busboy, who grabbed a whole bunch of silverware and set it down in a pile on our table and walked away looking annoyed. Finally, after more than an hour since we ordered, we approached the manager. As we began to explain that our food still wasn't there, he cut us off, pointing at the kitchen doors and retorting ""It's right there. There's your food."" and dismissing us.  We sat back down to some sub-par appetizers. We all agree that for their portion size and quality, the appetizers are extremely overpriced.  The cherry on top was having to remind the waitress that it was my friend's birthday (after we'd already told her twice in the beginning) so that she could at least enjoy a free scoop of ice cream for her day!  All in all, the waitress completely checked out, didn't check on us once in the whole hour span of us waiting for our food even though the restaurant wasn't busy AT ALL. We watched a young couple come in, order, get their food, pay, and leave all before we got our silverware. Although she did a terrible job, our waitress was a sweet lady. But that manager was a real jerk- he did not care the slightest bit whether or not we had good service.  Absolutely awful experience, and I will not be returning.

69,Carrie W.,"Severn, MD",129,508,289.0,2.0,2014-11-29,"I wanted to review this place a little higher, because I'll give our server credit - she did try, and she tried hard.  But the plain fact is that the food blows - I can't get around that. Friday's has changed a LOT since I've been last.  The prices have been jacked up beyond all reasonable measure - our meal, for two, was 50 dollars (a shared app + 2 entrees).  For Pete's sake, this is NOT a gourmet establishment - it's a Friday's!!!  Since when was a meal at a chain restaurant THIS much money? We ordered the ""Three for All"" sampler - potato skins, Asian dumplings and boneless buffalo wings.  Wing sauce was incredibly salty, almost to the point of being inedible.  The dumplings were cooked unevenly - two were a very dark brown (almost burned), two were undercooked and pasty.  The potato skins were the only thing I could consider ""okay"".  And, of course, what I really wanted - the pretzels with cheese sauce - they were out of.  Strike one. My husband ordered the Parmesan-crusted chicken - it was limp, soggy and the breading was just a sad mess.  The dish of mac and cheese that came with it looked like a Lipton Sides entree - I could have made better at home.  And I didn't even see the promised tomato and mozzarella salad that was supposed to come with it.  My husband just looked at me and was muttering, ""one and a half"".  As in, review this place with one and a half stars.  Strike two. My order, a Bleu Cheese Stacked burger, was only slightly better.  Granted, I didn't specify how I wanted it cooked (but then again, I was never asked, and I think I should have been) - but the patties were WILDLY uneven.  One patty was so overdone that it was nearly charcoal - a few seconds longer on that grill and it would have been inedible.  Inexplicably, the other patty was a perfect medium-rare.  It's like they were cooked at separate points - makes no sense.  The bacon was just okay, not nearly enough bleu cheese, and I had to drown the entire thing in ketchup just to get it down.  The fries were just fries - how do you mess up fries?  I have a feeling this place could do it. Did I mention that this meal was sodium city?  No?  There was so much salt that I think the Sysco people (which is, no doubt, where this mess came from) probably dipped it in the Red Sea for a few months before delivering it to Towson. I'm only giving it two stars because the server was sweet and DID try really hard.  But the service on other fronts wasn't all that stellar, either - a 15 minute wait when the place was half empty (my husband thinks they were short staffed, and that's probably true), and a VERY long wait for the food to come out.  And when it did - not impressed in the least. My husband reports that the restrooms were ""absolutely nasty"".  'nuff said there. You'll know the place when you see it.  It's the one with the eardrum-shattering music outside.  That was a turnoff even before we got in there, so I now consider it a warning sign, heh.

He came back out in like two mins. I thought to myself wow that was fast. I lifted up my bun and they scraped the mayo and everything else of the bun and then sent it back out. I was completely disgusted. I called for an manager and of course they apologized but he also ended up getting my order wrong. I brought it back to his attention and just asked for my bill.

They cleaned it and after 10 minutes the manager took our drink order. When our server arrived, he apologized for the wait, he was obviously slammed with tables and it was clear the kitchen wasn't keeping up.  We ordered the unlimited appetizers hoping they could make it out quickly. We were wrong. It took 45 minutes for the first 3 to arrive and 2 of them were cold. The rest of the appetizers came out about another 20 minutes afterward.  It actually was kind of funny. Food kept showing up at our table that wasn't ours, it was clear that the person (not our waiter) serving the food had no idea where food was supposed to go. It ended up being like Fogo de Chao - you just turn up your coaster to green and accept what comes to you. The college students next to us accepted ribs and burgers which is not what they ordered, they figured they were hungry and just ate it. We watched two parties nearby walk out after waiting too long for their food.  I'll give our waiter a little credit, he apologized profusely, helped us out on the bill a bit and was friendly.

Friday's, but my experience this past Saturday probably ranks as the worst experience I've ever had while dining out. The wait for a table wasn't bad...about 20-25 minutes long.  After we were seated, about 15-20 minutes went by before we even saw our server and it was only to say that she'd be back to take our order.  Well, she didn't return before we decided we were going to leave.  We ended up speaking with the Manager who convinced us to stay and he would put our orders in.  We ordered the endless apps, a cobb salad,  a kid's grilled chicken meal, two strawberry lemonades, and a kid's chocolate milk.  Nothing fancy.  It took forever before the food came out.  We didn't have enough silverware at the table...had to stop the manager to get that for us since we barely saw our server the entire night.  At some point, she did come by and took one of the strawberry lemonades and the kid's milk for a refill...she never brought them back.  We had to flag another staff member down to get our drinks.  I could go on, but I'm sure you get the point. On top of all of this, there were patrons screaming across the restaurant to other tables.  At some point, the cops were called.  Not sure what the reason was (it wasn't related to the screaming patrons).  The bathrooms were dirty and disgusting. Oh, and the kicker?  At the end of the night, one of the staff apologized for the horrible service and said she wished she would have known so that she could have done something about it.  She was really nice...and I could appreciate her concern.  She then asked if we wanted her to box up the food for us and we said okay.  She used HER HANDS to pick up the food on our plates to put it in the box!

63,Bri M.,"Reisterstown, MD",4,7,,1.0,2015-04-06,"To start, coming from working in the restaurant industry I will never return to this TGI Fridays location again. My family and I (Myself, my boyfriend, our young daughter, and my best friend) arrived to the restaurant after shopping in Towson Town. This was a Thursday around 6 pm, we walked in to be ""greeted"", for a lack of better words, by the hostess. She took my name and told us it would be about 5 minutes. We sat in the waiting area, directly across from the host podium. We didn't sit long, while walking to our table the hostess dropped her phone and my friend picked it up and gave it back. We sat in a corner booth near the bar, and everything was great up to this point. Our waitress was very sweet and accommodating. She quickly got us a high chair, because the host seemed to think that my one year old would be fine to sit in the booth or on my lap.  After about 35-40 minutes, having finished our appetizers and waiting for our dinner, the same hostess from earlier in the evening returned to our table, handing me a Victoria's Secret bag saying, ""Here's your bag."" and walking away. It took me a moment to process, and then it occurred to me that in the process of juggling a hungry toddler and going to our table I left my bag sitting in the waiting area. I opened the bag and it was empty. Nothing but a receipt and tissue paper. I immediately went to the host to ask where my things were. She told me someone brought the bag to her. When I asked who she replied with, ""I don't know."" She some how remembered me from 40 minutes before. I asked for a manager. After getting the run around for almost an hour, having already called the police. I took my daughter into the bathroom for a diaper change and upon pulling the changing table down, GET READY, I found a USED sanitary napkin. Disgusting! I couldn't take it. At that moment I was done. On my way out of the bathroom I found a tag to the bra I had just purchased. I took it to the manager and he informed me that the camera view was blocked by other customers. I returned to my table to tell my boyfriend. He then told me of waitress informed him that the camera couldn't be viewed for 24 hours, the manager lied to my face. We then asked to speak to a different manager.  Tim Diggs the general manager, was wonderful and extremely helpful. He took my information and assured me he would handle the matter personally. He even spoke to the police with me. Needless to say I will not be returning. While our waitress was wonderful and Tim was helpful. The original manager lied to me, the bathroom was appalling, and the hostess, well she could careless. I paid for a $60 meal I didn't eat and during my entire visit I felt like my stuff, my family and myself personally did not matter.

Not Anymore... This location is the absolute worse. I came to have lunch with my boyfriend and the entire experience was terrible!  1. The host wasn't even at the front of the restaurant when we entered. 2 separate servers continuously walked by us and didn't even say hello or ask if we needed help. Finally a girl came up and asked if we would like to be seated about 5-6 min after standing at the front desk. 2. The server had no clue what she wants doing and was an emotionless non energetic excuse of a waitress.  3 the drinks..... We ordered the apple martini and the cotton candy martini. Although they were tasty drinks you could defiantly taste the cheap liquor the company uses to sell its special drinks... The best part about my boyfriends martini was that it had a long black hair floating around a light green clear martini!!!! We told the server who was not apologetic and we had the drink remade.... We were sitting on the upper level booths were we could see the bartender roll his eyes and began making our new drink.... I'm sorry I didn't understand their attitude about remaking something that they did not make correctly.  4. My boyfriend ordered the sizzle shrimp with cheese and mash potatoes and his food came out sizzling and hot. My entree did not arrive I had ordered the French dip sandwich and soup. My waitress told me it would be here soon. I'm not kidding 15 minutes go by and neither my server or my food had come to the table. So I asked a passing server to get me the manager... The manager comes out and apologizes and makes some excuse about why my entree was not even made. He then tells me he will make it himself and have it for me. At this point my boyfriend was finished eating and I was just ready to go. The manager still made it and said I should take it Togo and he would take care of it.  5. Still after all that was said and done I still never recieved and apology from the server who clearly did not ring my food in to the system. I have zero tolerance for a liar....

So why would I an elite yelper who is big on service give this place a 4 star rating???!!!! Well I went old school on this chain and I think we're all better for it. So about a month ago I came to TGI Fridays and had the most horrible experience ever! I called ahead and wanted to check out the in this appetizers. The kids and I were on our own and we wanted to go on a mommy and little bell nation date . I called ahead to ask the post about the in this appetizers. I had seen all the commercials and was excited to dive in. So I talk with her and she told me all about the in this appetizers and how they work. She told me how she had done it herself with her mom and we'd have a great time. I asked her if we needed to make a reservation for that night and she said no. She said they were having a Bartenders Event but that they had set aside tables for others coming in. Long story short I arrived was seated after 40 plus minutes of wait. Sat at the table for another 25 min with no service AT ALL. When finally attended to it was just to ask if we had been waited on. Then I was told that the kitchen wasn't doing endless appetizers. CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW ANGRY I WAS!! The kids were breaking down, hungry and frustrated themselves. We left, hungry and upset. So of course i wanted to yelp a horrid review and join  the bandwagon of patrons who hate this place, but i was beyond pissed off. i didn't care to speak to the manager i wanted blood! so i called headquarters! of course they were nice, concerned and remorseful, but they said they were just gonna send me back to the manager to resolve the issue. i want thrilled. i wanted HQ to deal with their store! so a week or so later the manager called, and i told him what happened. He listened and could understand my frustration. He said they were still doing the Endless appetizers so he's not sure why they told me differently. anyway they sent me $45 gift card. i wasn't exactly happy. i just wanted a change in service! and i wanted to see that change reflected in their reviews. i did not want to have to patron this place ever again. And neither did the kids. So on to why these folks get a 4 star review. With GREAT reluctancy we went to TGI Fridays yesterday. Friday night, buzzing, ...i was so worried to put my kids through a bad experience again. they were like NOOOOOOO Mommy! But ii took them anyway. We walk in and the door guy was exceptionally polite as was the hostess. (i decided i wouldn't show the gift card or anything until i got the check at the end to ensure an authentic experience). We were seated an Jason was our waiter. Let me say, what an awesome guy. He is attentive without being invasive. he manages his tables well. he was accommodating. i ordered all kind of appetizers and the ones that were spicy he adjusted. i also ordered the cajun chicken and shrimp  noodles. which was good but small proportion for $13.  then for dessert the kids had dirt cups. fun. we actually had a great time. i noticed the table in front of us was having a difficult time, but the manager came out to apologize for their long wait for food (apparently he had just gotten there or something). But all wait staff was attentive. the food was good. Mozzerella sticks were large. Chicken was fluffy crispy, the loaded potato skins were Really good. my shirley temple was perfect. the wet hand towels are a nice touch especially for those of us with children. And when it came time to pay, you could tell that Jason was like oh shoot. i told him this experience was quite delightful and i really appreciated his kind service without knowing how horrible we were treated before. its Jason's type of care that is needed! And then as we were leaving everyone was delightful. So what do we say for a business that redeems itself. I say simply thank you. Because at the end of it all while getting in the car with my 7, 5, 4, 2yr old and 5month old i get a THANK YOU MOMMY. THAT WAS FUN.You have no idea how it feels to redeem oneself as a mom. I am guiding my children to know how to navigate the world and be great citizens despite negative experiences and not just for the reward. and this turned out to be a great lesson all across the board and that's what life is often about. how to navigate this life with each other and be our best in every situation.

It took the kitchen a while to prepare our meals.  When the meals came out we were not served all at the same time.  My meal (sliders) was incorrect but I was not asking for a replacement being that it would've taken longer.  The bread was a little hard too...

83,Keith H.,"Washington, DC",0,29,,3.0,2016-07-17,"Ever seen the skit ""Lowered Expectations"" on MADTv? That's kind of what it's like when a city guy goes into the suburbs and instead of going out to an independent, executive chef-driven restaurant, my rear end falls into the bar stool of a TGIFridays. But, what the hell, I'm hungry and it's one of the only options around. SERVICE: The bartenders definitely have personality. They seem to mesh well and communicate effectively with each other. Aside from a group of four high-decibel guys on the other side of the bar slamming shots like it was the last thirty seconds of happy hour (which it wasn't) the bar area was fairly quiet, and with three bartenders behind the bar there were no challenges in getting attention.  AM I ""HAPPY""?: So it's ""Happy Hour"" all day every day and $3 drafts, even though your choices are between Miller Lite (piss water) and Bud Lite (watered down piss water) are pretty good. I would have preferred liquor but all the specialty drinks contain either rum or tequila along with 10 fluid ounces of pure sugar so I stuck to drafts. CUISINE: The food is what I expected it to be. Even though the boneless wings are pre-fab frozen the sauce selections are pretty good and since I like sweet and tangy with a kick, the Memphis BBQ sauce worked great for me. I got the smaller portion, which was almost a meal in itself, so no complaints in the portioning department. Both blue cheese and ranch for dipping, which made me squeal with happiness (silently, of course). Next up, straight off the Jack Daniels grill menu page, the chicken sandwich. Similar to Chipotle, whatever they put in the sauce is like crack, addictive and delicious. The portion of fries could have been better, but not a big deal. SUMMARY: There are a lot of negative ratings on here for this location (as some seem to think they're a goddamned Michelin Star-level food critic (South Park episode!), but I cannot attest to them as I didn't have any real issue with my experience and it seems the majority of the parts of the restaurant that suck are in the dining room, not in the bar area. But seriously people, it's a cookie cutter casual dining chain/franchise concept assuming high employee turnover/seasonal employees. Don't go in expecting a tenured professional server, a back waiter, and support staff to provide further back up. This place is in a busy mall, meaning screaming children, a mother desperate for her chardonnay fix, a father on the border of psychosis, so go in with a light spirit and a ""you get what you pay for"" mentality, expect to wave down staff from time to time, and you'll be fine.

Funny thing is, the chicken print and juices were still there!!! SIDE NOTE: MY PARTNER IS PESCETARIAN (HaHaHa) And while we're on the subject of those ""grilled shrimp"", they were ice cold with no sign of ever being near the grill. The sriracha sauce was also MIA. We got the attention of the waiter, he tried his best to clear up the confusion of ""grilled"" not really meaning ""grilled"".

I ordered the black bean burger minus the dairy, add lettuce tomato, onion, pickles, avocado and mustard. When the burger arrived to the table, they certainly overachieved the blackness and I didn't get the right condiments. I didn't send it back.

We were accompanied by a teenage boy who ordered the ribs. He had no complaints....  Soooooo, we asked for the check. The manager so graciously removed the chicken/shrimp salad.

The receipt was brought over to the table and we discovered we had been shortchanged (literally). Now, You may be thinking, ""it's just .45 CENTS"". But still, it's the principle. Sure it wasn't even a full fifty cents but what gives you the right to deprive me of my hard earned coin and not even acknowledge it??? The manager was called to the table again. We explained the confusion, not with hopes of being comped our meal but with the intention of providing a learning experience to the young waiter.

So, we sent them back and requested non-alcoholic drinks. Then, my drink had a BUG in it. Service: The waiter waited for over 20min after we ordered drinks before asking if we were ready to order. Then, my food did not come out until 15 min after my mom's food came out and I had to hunt down our waiter to complain about it. So, we didn't get to enjoy a meal together. Management: They claimed to be sorry and stated the bill would be taken care of... I had to send the bill back twice because it still wasn't right. They wanted to charge my mom $3 and some change for her drink because there was no bug in her drink... Then I got fed up and decided no bill will be paid using any of my funds. I explained it to the waiter, who then got a different manager... And I told him the same thing.

15,Jamie A.,"Towson, MD",33,7,,1.0,2017-01-07,"My experience at this TGIF was horrible. I was there with my mother, some family and friends of my teenage niece as she celebrated her 16th birthday. Not really sure why she picked this location, I had never eaten at TGIF but there are plenty of good restaurents in the area that are far better than this wacko place they call a restaurant.  First my mother and I got there before the rest of the party (maybe 8 more people were to come) so we asked for a table to be put together. We waited for about half an hour, watching as different servers ran back and forth (all seeming lost) and had to stop them multiple times to ask when the table would be ready (the restaurant didn't appear busy at all, they knew our party would be arriving soon and no one was being attentive). Finally after asking 3 different people minimum and with the rest of the guest having arrived they begin to push two tables together. I believe two people were doing this and they still did not manage to set up the table in a way that made sense (just no sense of organization or presentation). There were no menues or silverware either.  Finally our waitress comes and takes everyone's drink order. We had to be waiting for about 20 minutes before we got our drinks. She then disappeared for a long time before coming back for our meal orders. THE FOOD TOOK FOREVER TO COME. We waited no less then half and hour, close to over an hour to receive food and none of it was brought to the table in a timely way. Entrees were brought out 15-20 mines apart for each of us and it was very irritating not having food plus having a disappearing server.  When the food came it was underwhelming and my food (pasta) was barely warm. Some people never got their food until everyone was done eating, one of my nieces friends probably waited over and two hour for wings. Also my sister went to the bathroom and came back in disgust for how dirty they were. We were all very annoyed and continuously tried getting the attention of our server (or any server who walked by) to ask for the manager. We asked for the manager maybe 8 times and they never came until we were about to leave.  Needless to say we did not pay for that dining experience. The manager came out, appearing to be on drugs (very twitchy and just strange). He said he would comp the entire bill, disappeared with the check and had us waiting around even more! It was horrible. Never going back there again. Please go to any of the other bars and restaurants in Towson.

My party of 3 was told that the wait would be less than 10 minutes even though almost half of the tables in the restaurant were empty. (Not clean, but empty) we waited 20-30 minutes before we were seated.  The waitress was nice but she gave us chicken instead of salmon, she never asked the kitchen if I could add on more steak to a salad, and instead made a the choice to give me less on her own.  We did not see her after she took our orders until she came to give us the check, which took her 20 extra minutes to produce once we presented a coupon. We had to track down the manager to find her.  We spent more than twice the amount of time waiting on the wrong food and our waitress than we wanted to spend there over all.   Once we finally got to pay, we asked for everything to be split between 2 cards, down the middle. Of course, that was a huge ordeal and she just moved meals around and our group paid vastly different amounts for the disappointing meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-towson,1.44,1.44,1.44,,1.44

The bartender says "" funny story, the entire draft system is down"". I'm thinking to myself yea that's really hysterical!!! So I order a domestic bottle that he didn't have in stock (miller lite). Ordered a second beer 20 minutes later & he had to leave again to get that one too. It did appear like they were understaffed as he was waiting tables as well.
