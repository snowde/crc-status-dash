Thought to myself, no biggie a couple dollars over -- I should have looked before signing. Now after reviewing the receipts from my business travel it turns out I signed for $29.04 on a $24.04 bill (i tipped him a generous 20%) but he ran my card for more than the miscalculated bill was to begin with!

The service, on the other hand, was lackluster.  The seating hostess was telling us all about the specialties, yet couldn't answer a single question about ANYTHING.  One time we had a server who was late to greet us (we had already decided what we were going to order) and practically ignored us the whole time.

The service was terrible.  It seems as the cook staff was undermanned as was the busboys.  It took a lengthy amount of time to get a burger and a side of pretzels.  The waitress was not very customer servicy, even though she didn't have a lot of tables. I was with another party.  Instead of asking how the bills would be split, the waitress came up with her own way of distributing the food, with which confusion ensued.

Wonderful. So good. I went back another night. What happened?? The wedges were dryyyyyyy. I drank all of my water and then some trying to choke down those potatoes which was a shame because the flavour was amazing. The ribs were kinda funky. A little on the tough side which turned me off. The ribeye was still good, though. The bartender was really nice. He was super knowledgeable about the menu and what went with certain drinks. He made me something called a Junebug. It was green and delicious. Sweet, sour, and fruity. I don't care for desserts, but I tried a whiskey brownie... It was lacking a lot of whiskey and a lot of brownie. It was mostly whipped cream. The only problem is I think the restaurant relies a lot on the fact that it's attached to a hotel to keep it going. One night I wondered in and I didn't feel like sitting at the bar. There was no one at the podium to seat me. Servers walked by, smiled, and did nothing else. Didn't even tell anyone that there was a bunch of other confused-looking people were wandering about. A waitress walked by, so of course we asked her when someone would come to seat us. She got a little snappy and said that there would be no one and that we could only order take-out.

So you would think the ""chef"" would have enough time to put the love in their food. I was wrong. I'm a huge salad girl, I always get salads added as a side. I got the Bleu cheese wedge. This is the only salad I have never finished in my life. They put so much dressing on it that it was inedible. You really have to be a bad cook if you can't even get a salad right. I got the Jack Daniels glazed steak, wanted medium rare, it came out medium, almost medium well. The only reason I didn't send it back is because the glaze was so delicious and put a nice char on the steak, so either way I think it would have seemed over cooked for my liking. Then last thing! Seasoned fries I thought were supposed to be seasoned! I had to put pepper and salt on them. A bunch. I'm very sensitive to salt, so I hardly use a salt grinder. My sister got the pecan encrusted chicken salad. Too much dressing on that and the chicken was overcooked and dry.

My husband has Celiac disease so we specifically requested NO CROUTONS on his salad. Low and behold, Marilyn brought his salad out with chopped up croutons that blended in the salad. My husband ate a fork full of the salad and realized that it had croutons. We told Marilyn what happened because our original waitress Amanda was no where to be found. Marilyn took the salad off the table and walked away without a single word! It took another 20 min to get a different salad. I told Marilyn the severity of the mistake they made and she did not seem to care one little bit. After eating our meals, we requested the bill. My husband began to have horrible stomach pains d/t the croutons, so I decided to leave quickly instead of speaking with the manager about my horrible experience. Marilyn brought out the wrong bill. After 10 more minutes, we finally received the bill. Marilyn seemed very passive aggressive and uncaring when I told her that my husband's stomach was hurting d/t the croutons.

Grabbed mozzarella sticks during my lunch break and they literally tasted like they had been fried in week old oil. Immediately after I got off work, I called to speak with a manager. I explained it to her as clearly as I am explaining it now, and she acted like she didn't understand. ""So you're saying there was no cheese inside? ""Me: ""no, I'm saying they were made in old grease."" Her: ""well we have had the same grease for only three days and won't be changing it again until tomorrow morning so if we remake it for you it will be made with the same grease."" First of all, 3 day old grease?! Gross! I said ""wow, ok so Can I get my money back then?"" At this point I heard another woman's voice shout something. The manager I'm speaking with says ""shhh, she can hear you!"". I hear the other voice say something muffled followed by ""that b*tch on the phone""!!! She then comes back on the phone as if nothing happened. I told her I heard everything and I asked for her name as I was ready to call corporate at this point. I was respectful until I was called a b*tch. She hung up without telling me her name. I called back and asked a server. So, to Brooke the manager at this location, congratulations.
