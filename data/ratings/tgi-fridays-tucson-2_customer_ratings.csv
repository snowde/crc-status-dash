11,Brittney G.,"Tucson, AZ",0,1,,1.0,2012-11-26,"Probably my worst restaurant experience ever. My husband and our friends came in at about 7:00 on Saturday night. We stood at the front waiting to be seated for a bit. There were servers gathered in the back just staring at us. The could have sat us themselves but they were too busy in the back. We finally got seated and waited at our table for over 15 minutes without a server or even the hostess greeting the table and taking our drink order. The same servers standing and gossiping in the back, were still there just staring at us. After waiting 20 minutes without seeing our server, we got up and left and went else where. If you are only kind of hungry and don't mind waiting a ridiculous amount of time for even a drink, the food is good. But other than that, I won't be returning and I suggest you shouldn't even bother.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tucson-2,,,,,
2,John T.,"Sahuarita, AZ",0,44,2.0,1.0,2012-12-23,"This place needs to be visited by a wrecking ball.  We stopped in for a an appetizer and desert and found sticky menus, an absurdly crooked table... I thought to myself, man, this place is kinda run down but let's order.  After the order, went to wash up, and the bathroom was nasty.  Not the kind of nasty that comes from not checking on the restrooms every few hours, but the kind of nasty that comes from years of neglect.  This place is in just disrepair and its sad when places go down hill like this. Now, onto the food.  We ordered a trio of appetizers, the mozzarella sticks were fine, the boneless were ok, but the potato skins were awful.  For desert, we shared a salted caramel cake with ice-cream and it was good.  All said and done with a modest tip, $27. If you like mediocre food, higher prices, and a nasty building (if you read this and you go in, really start looking around and you'll see what I mean) --- this place is for you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tucson-2,,,,,
7,Zack S.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,17,,3.0,2013-03-15,"Had the taps steak skewers...amazing! I could bathe in the sauce! And $3 tall Stella or any kind of beer cant be beat! Stellaaaaaaaaaaa! Sat at the bar, bartender was a tool, and the guy across the bar actually made me uncomfortable, awkwardly sucking on some girls neck and face!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tucson-2,,,,,
1,Lauren K.,"Tucson, AZ",81,338,81.0,2.0,2013-03-21,"Friday's restaurants as a whole seem to have declined over the last decade.  This Friday's is no stranger to that, and it may have declined worse than other locations.  I'm actually quite shocked it's still opened.  It's completely run down.  The stripes on the tables are rubbed off, and what's left of them are stained on some tables.  The tables also don't sit flat on the ground, so they jiggle or are on a slant all the time.  The rest of the restaurant interior is dark and dingy.  For some reason, they still think the decor style of crap on the walls is still in -- it's not.  It's just old and tired.  The place needs a face lift big time. The food has declined, too.  The portions are smaller, and what you do get just doesn't taste that great.  Some food, like the burgers, are just ok.  The pasta dishes that I once enjoyed are now bad and skimpy.  The appetizers are clearly frozen and heated up.  There's just nothing good about the food besides the fact that you basically know what you're going to get in terms of flavors when you walk into any Friday's. The staff is what brings this review up a star.  They've always been pretty nice and fairly attentive.   If you sign up for their stripes program, they also offer some decent coupons somewhat regularly, which is the only time I ever end up going to Friday's.  No coupon = no go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tucson-2,,,,,
10,Carol S.,"Tucson, AZ",1,41,,1.0,2013-03-21,"After reading all the other reviews on this page, I guess I lucked out.  I had the ""new"" Korean steak tacos (on flour tortillas rather than on corn tortillas) and they were really, really, excellent.  It was freshly prepared, as was the rice, and the seasonings were great.  However, the facility is a total disaster and desperately needs to be renovated -- the bathrooms were disgusting, the chairs are all falling apart, the tables  don't have four even legs (or maybe the floor is just uneven), the floors needed sweeping, and everything just looked OLD -- as though nothing had been fixed since the store opened 30 or 40 years ago.  See John T's review about the facility--It's right on the money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tucson-2,,,,,
5,Cesar G.,"Broomfield, CO",1,17,1.0,2.0,2013-03-25,"It's a chain, so it's like any other Fridays.  The service was slow, at the bar, and there was not that many people there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tucson-2,,,,,
3,Melisa R.,"Tucson, AZ",115,132,,1.0,2013-04-26,"Drove past there last night and I'm happy to report this place has closed! When you let basic cleanliness and service decline as this location did, closing is sure to follow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tucson-2,,,,,
