During our last dining experience, we shared a strawberry mint mojito, ahi crisps, cajun chicken & shrimp pasta w/ side of Jack daniel's sauce, and salted caramel cake for dessert. It was all deliciously unhealthy, fattening, and tasty.  Cons: We went the weekend after Valentine's day, so it was pretty packed and we had to wait over 30 minutes for a table.

13,Brandy W.,"Oklahoma City, OK",79,527,425.0,2.0,2014-08-15,The lunch special price was low but the portions were way too small and I left hungry.  Part of the problem was that the Caeser salad was made with iceberg type lettuce and it was very odd.  The dressing was also not of a good flavor.   The sandwich half was the size of a slider and the meat was almost non-existent.  I would not order the lunch deal again.  I also would not order a caeser salad here again. I wish I would have gone for the all you can eat appetizer and just had that instead......,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tulsa-2,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003

We ordered burgers and I ordered mine with mustard only.  After several times of arguing about the toppings, I finally snapped that I would like my food prepared how I ordered it. I like my burgers plain because mixing textures bother me. I hate cheese on a burger and always have.

22,Samantha K.,"Owasso, OK",39,88,222.0,4.0,2014-10-05,My husband and I went in late last night after going to the fair. We had a couple drinks and endless appetizers. They have a couple new appetizers and we tried the spicy chicken tostados and pot stickers. They were both amazing. The endless apps are $10 each and we had one refill of each. That was well worth the $20. Our waitress was pretty awesome and helpful in choosing drinks. The restaurant was clean and tidy and all the staff was very friendly. We would definitely go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tulsa-2?start=20,,,,,
28,Ginny B.,"Uptown, Tulsa, OK",18,20,13.0,4.0,2014-11-20,"We're usually always pleased with the food and service at the 41st street location. I've been a Stripes member for a few years. And, because of that, have earned enough points for several free steaks. This has been quite welcome as feeding a teenage boy can be quite costly. The food portions are generous enough that I typically get to take 1/2 my meal home for lunch the following day. I highly recommend trying the pot stickers as a starter. I'm looking forward to our next visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tulsa-2?start=20,,,,,

I was half way into my rack of ribs by the time our drinks arrived. I am extremely patient, considerate to one having a hard time if in the ""weeds"" (over seated without ability to catch up) and as is my daughter, having very good manners. I didn't understand why I felt an attitude growing from our waitress.

However, our waitress walked by our table several times without even acknowledging us at all, and we had to wait about 10 min before she even approached us to take our simple drink order of water. We are very patient people but I felt as if we were just an annoyance to her and she minimally checked on us.

20,Laura C.,"Tulsa, OK",0,14,4.0,1.0,2015-07-31,"If I could give less than one star I could. There were people waiting, but there were many open tables. I asked for a table 3 times and my husband once and we were still taken to a booth on the other side of the restaurant. When I again said I need a table we were told to go back to the entrance and wait even though there were several open tables in front of us. Then, instead of seating us at one of the open tables, we were repeatedly told to sit and wait on the bench that was clearly blocked by a group of people waiting to check in. He then proceeded to help the people who just walked in while we were supposed to wait. We left and went elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tulsa-2?start=20,,,,,
25,Shawn H.,"Blue Springs, MO",0,1,,1.0,2015-08-06,I ordered food for pick up. Was greeted at the door and told to pick it up at the bar. Sat there for 10 minutes without being greeted. Other guests made comments I was going without service. Turns out they were friends with the absent bartender and the manager that finally came over. No apologies for lack of service. Paid for food and still  waited five minutes for her to pick it up from behind the bar and give it to me. I could see it the whole time. Cold food. Horrible experience. There for 25 minutes and never did see the bartender.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tulsa-2?start=20,,,,,

7,Courtney E.,"Broken Arrow, OK",218,334,1360.0,3.0,2015-11-05,"I've always been a fan of Friday's, but probably not for the right reasons. I think it was just a convenience thing. Like 'where do you want to eat?' 'we'll be by Friday's.' 'ok that sounds good.' then we leave disappointed. It's familiar, it's a place my entire family can agree on, we know what we eat there, but it's rarely a fantastic experience. The atmosphere is fun, the wait staff is hit or miss, the food quality varies from good to meh, and the prices seem to keep going up. Sadly the only time we've eaten there recently has been when we've had a buy one/get one free coupon, and we still felt like we overpaid.  The last visit was after I had worked a half day on Halloween, and my husband had dropped me off that morning so he could go do car stuff. When he picked me up we were both hungry, so we decided to hit up Friday's because it was super close and we had a COUPON. Both ordered the same thing - build your own burger, I requested no tomato. Our waitress took forever to bring our drinks, like 10 minutes. It wasn't busy, and whenever we needed something it was hard to track her down. Someone else delivered our food, no telling how long that would have taken if our original waitress had done it. When our food came out, my burger had tomato on it. Not a big deal, maybe she didn't write it down. Both of our burgers were pretty dark, like we could tell they were very well done (burnt) before we even took a bite. Super dry, my husband joked that it took an entire bottle of ketchup for him to finish it (our bottle ran out, but it wasn't full when we sat down). Didn't bring it up to our waitress because we were 'about to eat my own arm' hungry and we couldn't track her down anyway. We finally saw her when she dropped off the check, but she ran off before I could get a to-go cup. I almost went to grab one myself. Oh well. Fries were good, nice seasoning. I had ordered a Strawberry Mango Iced Tea - super strong mango flavor so if you love mango you will love this. Super sweet, but watering it down seemed to make it sour. Good, but strong - you have been warned.  This probably won't be our last visit, because we are gluttons for punishment I guess. This is the restaurant that we've broken up with a few times but we always go back. I would have ordered my classic standby (the chicken with mango salsa on the top, and rice) but I didn't see it on the menu. If it's gone for good, that might be the last straw.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tulsa-2,,,,,
18,Kelly C.,"Tulsa, OK",20,2,,1.0,2016-01-04,Me and my friend went there and I ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp.  Went it was served to me it was sizzling and that was the only thing right about the meal. The potatoes had cheese sprinkled on them. It was not melted at all. The chicken was cooked tooooooo long and it tasted scorched!  The shrimp was old. The whole meal was not pleasing at all!!! Sent it back and did not want anything else. If u destroyed that meal not going for a second one even tho it was offered. Never to patronize there again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tulsa-2,,,,,
6,Lars D.,"Raleigh, NC",46,228,176.0,3.0,2016-03-16,"Had the ribeye which was pretty good.  Wedge salad also very tasty. Spinach side is excellent - probably best part of the meal.

14,Blake S.,"Broken Arrow, OK",53,223,15.0,3.0,2016-09-05,"Honestly, I was much more impressed by the restaurant in Gurnee Illinois. This was only because it wasn't as crowded. This of course was due to the timing that everyone in my group decided to go. Food wasn't too bad but I felt like everything was cooked too fast.

3,Katie D.,"Tulsa, OK",128,168,280.0,4.0,2016-12-19,We went here for a free night that a friend who is on the Stripes program invited us to. We were pleasantly surprised!

0,Rachel S.,"Tulsa, OK",27,148,36.0,4.0,2017-02-10,"They only have 1 location left and service seems to have improved now that they are the only location in town. Sit at the bar to take advantage of $5 appetizers!  I would recommend ordering the apps all around - 3, 4 or 5 apps from their choices- wings and then choice of several sides. I highly suggest the pretzel sticks with beer cheese or the potstickers. Their chicken fingers have greatly improved- nice buttermilk breading and then topped with honey. Their French fries are eh, so substitute one of their other sides- mac and cheese is good! I like their bourbon barrel chicken that is grilled and smoked over a bourbon soaked plank- and served that way (even to-go orders).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tulsa-2,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
11,Tiffany N.,"Pharr, TX",70,12,7.0,1.0,2017-03-04,TGIFridays is usually a favorite place for my boyfriend and I to visit but this location does not have it together. We just spent an hour and a half there during a slow time. The hostess wasn't even at the hostess booth when we walked in and we had to wait almost five minutes for her to show up. She was incredibly rude because she had to bus a table for us and the two parties of two that walked in right before us as well as the party of two that walked in after us who ended up on leaving because they didn't want to wait and they didn't care for her rude attitude towards them. She also said nothing to us when we left the restaurant and she walked around in a huff the entire time we were there and we could hear her loudly complaining. The waitress we had was very slow and kept letting our waters run out. It also took her ten minutes to even acknowledge our presence. We could hear people yelling and arguing in the kitchen. The women's bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned all day. There was water all over the counter and splattered on all the mirrors. It looked like the body length mirror had blood spots on it. The trash was over flowing with paper towels so much that they were scattered all over the floor. The only good thing about our visit was the food and finally getting to leave. I do not think we will return to this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tulsa-2,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

We sat at the bar, was told they didn't have any beer on tap working.  Made a drink order and told him we wanted to place a food order. When finally asked for our order we ordered a chicken walnut salad and a quesadilla. After waiting for almost 45 minutes without being checked on or given any explanation for why the food was so slow, food finally arrived. Salad was wilted, and chicken was cold. Quesadilla was all right. Took forever to pay out. Hardly anyone else there. No excuse for such bad service and timing.
