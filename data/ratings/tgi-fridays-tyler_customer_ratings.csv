8,Jen G.,"Kilgore, TX",20,203,72.0,1.0,2013-08-17,Took forever to be greeted by waiter. Seated near kitchen where staff are yelling at each other and throwing things. Waiter getting ice and slamming lid so hard it sounds like a gunshot. Yikes!  Bartender called wait staff over to sample a mixed drink before he sent it out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tyler,,,,,
12,Ashley J.,"Kilgore, TX",2,6,2.0,5.0,2015-02-24,Food was great as usual. Server was outstanding...I commend miss Shelby for her attention to my allergy. She took time to inform kitchen staff and manager to ensure my safety. Thank you Shelby we enjoyed every minute of dinner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tyler,,,,,
18,Elizabeth J.,"Houston, TX",5,85,7.0,4.0,2015-03-28,"Hadn't been to a Friday's in I can't even tell you how long. My fiancé's parents were in town so we all went and all thoroughly enjoyed our meals. I always get the jack Daniels chicken with broccoli & mashed potatoes, yummmm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tyler,,,,,
9,Sandra B.,"Miami, FL",104,12,31.0,1.0,2015-05-01,"THE WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD AT A TGI FRIDAYS!! I don't even know where to begin. My family, friends and I were staying at the Villages resorts and decided to go here for dinner. We were a party of 10. Our server was the WORST EVER! My friend ordered a beer and there was a little piece of chicken floating in it! YES CHICKEN!! Disgusting. We told the server, and she seemed unbothered. We had to literally go to the bar to find out what happened. Ordering took forever! One of the people in my party is a vegetarian and she ordered potato skins without bacon, letting the server know specifically she couldn't eat meat, and of course they come out with bacon. Food took forever. Almost everyone's order was messed up. Fries instead of mashed potatoes. and other mistakes. Drinks were BARELY refilled and empty plates were never taken away. Table was full of junk! Disgusting. I had a free dessert coupon and of course the wrong dessert was brought out! One of my friends went outside to have a cigarette and she let the server know that she would be right back, but she threw her food away anyway without asking, and she barely ate any of it. While paying, all the checks were mixed up and items had to be moved from check to check. I wanted to have my stripes added to my account and she kept telling me that my phone number was wrong even though I showed her directly from my account on my TGI FRIDAYS app. Finally she used the account number and it worked. Took forever to receive change. We had a manager come out and speak to us because of how terrible the service was, he removed the food that was taken off of my friends check but she still left hungry. DISASTER! I advice everyone to go somewhere else if hungry, this location is not worth the wait or the service. At least I have to compliment the kitchen though, the food THAT WAS BROUGHT OUT CORRECTLY was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tyler,,,,,
10,Jacey M.,"Dallas, TX",159,62,4.0,5.0,2015-05-19,I love this place! I usually sit at a booth in the bar and get half priced appetizers which are all very good. My favorite is the pretzels and beer cheese. Their drink specials are some of the best in town and happy hour is all day! I've always gotten excellent service when I've come here as well!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tyler,,,,,
16,Michael B.,"Tyler, TX",48,49,42.0,2.0,2015-07-01,"Went here today for lunch with my girlfriend.  Was greeted by no one at first until the host came from around the corner, smacking his gum.  Even though I was talking directly to him and looking at him, he decided to stare at my girlfriend and talk to her.  In fact, he stopped by our table at least 3 times to ask ""if everything was ok"" again staring at her.  We were just fine with the attention our waitress was giving us.  Our waitress had to tell the host to leave her alone (It seemed like he was more interested in picking up girls than doing his job).  If for no other reason, we won't be back due to the unwanted attention and staring from the host.  Otherwise, mostly retired looking people eating lunch today.  Our waitress was nice and checked up on us several times. We were hoping for a 2 for 20 menu but to no avail.   My gf ended up getting skewered chicken (she said they were good) and I got the endless buffalo wings (which were alright).  We had a clean table and quick service.  Next time though, we'll go to AppleBee's for their 2 for 20 and hope we don't get a stalker/lurker host.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tyler,,,,,
15,Chris M.,"Tyler, TX",19,6,3.0,4.0,2015-07-04,Got the potsticker and cheese sticks they were great the jewel of the meal was the ribeye and mephis rib the ribs were great not chewy like most places the steak was cooked the way i liked it rare,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tyler,,,,,
13,Lezlie T.,"Port Neches, TX",0,2,,1.0,2015-08-13,"Horrible service!  My food was ok, but my coworker's pasta had been put in the microwave which left parts of the pasta cold.  We will never go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tyler,,,,,
0,Carrie H.,"Issaquah, WA",44,438,542.0,4.0,2015-10-12,"Justin was our waiter and while I feel he had too many tables for one person he was very professional and kind. Our food was hot and amazing. I absolutely love the Sizzling Chicken and Cheese plate. You can hear it coming to you and the amount of cheese they put on it is awesome. I also love the Jack Daniel's Sauce they offer on different menu items. They are also offering unlimited refills on appetizers right now a great thing to have during game night!! I'm happy that my family lives in Tyler and my husband and I actually get a dinner here together without kids. Would I return? Yes, I missed TGIF when we moved to the greater Seattle area. This is one chain I am very happy to add to my dinner list when my husband and I go out to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tyler,,,,,
14,Rick M.,"Flint, TX",0,27,,1.0,2015-12-25,"Bad food, poor service, terrible atmosphere. I used to go there quite often, but never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tyler,,,,,
11,Deanna R.,"Bullard, TX",0,50,,4.0,2016-04-29,We had the potato skins which are very over priced for what you get.  Then we had baby back ribs which were outstanding.  Our waitress was excellent.  Always enjoy going here & will be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tyler,,,,,
7,Renee D.,"Palestine, TX",0,5,,2.0,2017-01-05,Basically the same menu as Applebee's or Chili's.  A lot of seafood and over priced  pasta.  Don't care for either.  After our waiter brought our food we didn't see him again until it was time to pay.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tyler,,,,,
6,Cheryl W.,"Lawton, OK",2,128,149.0,2.0,2017-03-22,Went here the other night. Mostly young people and the food wasn't very good. What happened?  This used to be a nice dining restaurant but where we went it looks Ike's like college kids out drinking and college kids working there and heavy greasy food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tyler,,,,,
5,Geoff B.,"Rusk, TX",67,29,14.0,1.0,2017-05-14,"Went into TGIF about 10 to 12 years ago. was seated and 15 minutes no-one came to get a drink order or check on us. So I have never went back until yesterday. Guess what happened??? 15 minutes later we got up because no-one came to wait on me. Maybe I just look that way??? My philosophy is that it's my money and I'll spend it where I want to, just won't want to at any TGIF, ever......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tyler,,,,,
2,Lesley H.,"Tyler, TX",153,155,5.0,1.0,2017-07-13,"We haven't been in a while - but it wasn't good.  We got the spinach cheese dip - which was good.  They didn't give us hardly any chips.  The guacamole that came with it was brown.   I had the flatbread pizza for dinner, and it was over-cooked.   My husband had a burger, which was perfectly cooked but greasy.  My daughters pasta was like soup.  My son had mac & cheese, which he said was good.  Our waiter was great!! The new tiki drinks were really good.  I might go back for drinks, but we won't go back to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tyler,,,,,
4,Roy W.,"Tyler, TX",0,100,,2.0,2017-08-14,We have been back four times since my last review. The restaurant is unkept and overall run down! The food quality has gone down hill along with the service. Food is very greasy and poorly prepared! The overall expierence is more in line with a low end fast food restaurant! The pricing doesn't reflect this as it is expensive considering portions and overall quality! I highly recommend going elsewhere as there is nothing that justifies your money to be totally wasted here!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tyler,,,,,
1,Marvin K.,"Tyler, TX",5,20,,2.0,2017-12-02,"My wife and I hadn't been to this TGI Fridays in about 5 years. As the service and quality of food was so lackluster last time, we haven't been back. Today, we were doing Christmas shopping, and as Fridays was just across the parking lot, and we didn't feel like doing any more driving around, we decided to eat at Fridays. Big mistake. We arrived at 4 pm. There were literally more employees in the place than customers. There were only 3 tables of customers.  We were not greeted with smiles and welcomes, which should have been our first clue to leave. Granted, working as a host or waiter in a restaurant isn't anyone's idea of a dream job, but as these people, usually young, are serving the public, and being paid to do a job, they need to at least paint a fake smile on their faces and act like they're having a good time. Honestly, I'm getting pretty sick of looking at the dour expressions on too many of our young people today. The waiter, another young man with a disinterested look on his face, came to take our order. My wife ordered a french dip, but I wasn't quite ready. The waiter come back about 15 minutes later to ask if I had decided. Duh! Anyway, I ordered a burger and fries, and a side salad. I requested the salad be served before my burger and fries. After about 25 minutes a server brings out our food, including the salad that I had asked to be served before my burger. But no fries with my burger. This is sheer stupidity.  The server says he'll have the kitchen make the fries. Ten minutes later, I'm staring at my burger getting colder by the minute, while I'm waiting for the fries. As any McDonalds employee can tell you, it takes 3 minutes to deep fry fries. So, I asked to speak to a manager. Five minutes later, the manager, as well as my fries, arrive.  I explained to the manager what I had ordered, and had asked for the salad to be served first. I pointed out that they weren't even busy. I said, ""Come on man, this isn't difficult work you're doing here. How do you screw up a simple hamburger order?""  I told him to take all of my food away, as the burger was now cold, and I no longer wanted any of it.  He took my food away, and said he wouldn't charge us for the meal.  Well, I wasn't going to pay for my burger anyway at this point. He did comp my wife's  french dip. There were no apologies though.  They get the second star from me, simply because my wife did enjoy her meal. With an overall rating on Yelp for this location of 2.5 stars, I'm surprised the place is still open. Clearly, corporate headquarters needs to check out this store. I doubt they care though. We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tyler,,,,,
3,Chris W.,"Tyler, TX",0,12,3.0,2.0,2017-12-31,"For New Year's Eve 2017, my husband and I wanted a casual but decent meal. We made a 6:15 reservation through Open Table.  The reservation was unnecessary as there were very few diners present. I mentioned our reservation to the host but he did not ask for our name nor did he wish us Happy New Year.  Our server arrived and promptly took our drink and appetizer order.  While courteous, it was quite obvious that he was not happy to be working on New Year's Eve.  Both our appetizers and entrees were acceptable, nothing other than what we expected from this restaurant. The next time we saw our server was when he delivered our check. He did not ask if our food was okay or if we were interested in dessert, nor did he wish us,  ""Happy New Year"". Moreover, the manager on duty was present and he too, failed to thank us for dining there. What a disappointing way to spend a special evening-especially so since we recently moved here and would have enjoyed having this as a dining option.  A little kindness and client care could have truly changed our experience but no such luck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tyler,,,,,
