2,Rob N.,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",6,33,4.0,3.0,2012-09-02,"I think I was unlucky and lumbered with the amateur waiter.  The place was quite cramped too, and not as spacious as some of the other TGI's I've visited. The bar is good though.  Actually, every TGI's bar is good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-uk-bristol-2,,,,,
0,Jan S.,"San Diego, CA",88,23,2.0,4.0,2014-04-21,Great place if your missing America. Make sure to order angus beef. Sooo much better. Cocktails should be made stiffer considering the price.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-uk-bristol-2,,,,,
