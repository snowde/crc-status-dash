2,Robyn C.,"Cheadle Hulme, United Kingdom",22,84,149,4.0,2014-05-02,"Come here a lot and usually have great food ! however, tonight has been a little disappointing ! Starters fab as always, sesame chicken strippers and mozzarella dippers ! Another member of our party had the potato skins however and was very disappointed with how bland they were ! We then tried their new burger menu which they launched recently, I ordered the pulled pork and my other half ordered the Bruce lee.  Firstly, two pulled porks came and although they did apologise for the wrong order, we had waited about an hour for food so couldn't be bothered waiting any more !  The burgers themselves have changed, they are made from chuck and brisket now and were very nice. However, my burger had virtually no pulled pork on and the meals were lukewarm at best ! Although temperature was mentioned, we just couldn't be bothered sending them back after waiting so long so they did take some starters off the bill charge which was nice.  Usually this place is spot on so i look forward to writing a better review next time !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-uk-cheadle,,,,,
