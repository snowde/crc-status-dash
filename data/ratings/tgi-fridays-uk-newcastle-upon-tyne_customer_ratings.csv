2,Frances B.,"Surbiton, London, United Kingdom",29,122,57.0,4.0,2012-12-09,"I have had some good and bad experiences at various TGI Friday's outlets over the years, but I was pleasantly surprised at this one in Newcastle.  I visited when I was with my boyfriend over the weekend. Now it was a Saturday lunchtime so it was busy, projected 20 minutes but turned out to be less than 10! The bar man was friendly enough whilst we were waiting for our food, but our waitress Amy was really lovely and friendly, you could tell she had everything under control as she was dealing with several tables.  The food was good, I LOVE the Jack Daniels shrimp, and they also have some decent beers now; we had Modela Negra and Sierra Nevada which went down well on a Saturday afternoon.  When we got on the train back to Leeds my boyfriend realised he had left his beloved flat cap behind! We called them today and spoke to a girl called Faye, and she kindly offered to post it back to us which was really nice.  Overall, great experience especially for a large chain, they certainly stood out from the many branches I have visited. Especially thanks Amy and Faye!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-uk-newcastle-upon-tyne,,,,,

1,Simone L.,"Newcastle, United Kingdom",9,40,23.0,5.0,2015-06-27,"Exceptional service, unfaultable food, and the best drinks menu you'll ever see. I had a lovely experience at TGI'S tonight and would highly recommend the mushroom bruscetta to start and purple rain cocktail to drink. Not cheap but not too expensive either. Worth it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-uk-newcastle-upon-tyne,,,,,
