0,Geir R.,"Florence, Italy",126,40,995,4.0,2015-05-18,"TGI Friday's Jessheim just opened last year, and I'd say it is one of their better locations. Quality of both food and service are good, plus the interior is really cool! As for the beer selection they have Ringnes and Brooklyn Lager on tap, plus 8-10 bottled beers. Works for me as the Brooklyn one is a favorite. Oh, and the texas chili cheese burger I had yesterday was awesome! Really tasty and juicy, with the addition of some extra jalape√±os it was perfect :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ullensaker,,,,,

Watch out if you order gluten free buns to your burger. Two tines we've orderd it to one of our girls. And both time they forgot to take gluten free buns. They sorted it out in a good way booth times, but it makes you a bit skeptic",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ullensaker,,,,,
