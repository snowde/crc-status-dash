492,Anna F.,"Union City, CA",0,3,,1.0,2012-01-15,"With all the restaurants in the Union Landing mall, you'd think the competition would make restaurants step up.  Not so, apparently. I ordered two meals ""to go"" (chicken picata pasta).  The person taking the phone order seemed to have better things to do -- and had to ask more than once what I wanted.  She repeated it back, finally, --and hung up.  No reference (like name or phone number), no estimate of when the order would be ready -- just hung up! I immediately got in my car and went to pick up the order.  After being asked to wait when I told her I had called in my order (and she asked what I had ordered), the young woman came back after a while and told me they didn't have it.  Apparently, it was a ""new item"" on the menu (I had looked at the menu on-line) and they didn't ""stock"" yet. Come on, people.  First of all, Friday's needs to get their act together.  Second of all, Friday's needs to make sure their people are trained so they know what's on the menu and what's not.  I should have been told on the phone that they didn't have that dish.  But probably MOST important, their people should be trained to act a little more professionally.  Hanging up on customers without so much as a good-bye isn't very hospitable at all -- isn't that what the restaurant business is about? Final result:  I said, ""Never mind..."" and went and ordered take-out from Applebee's.  At least the server there was pleasant and seemed to know what I was talking about when I ordered!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=500,2.44,2.67,2.67,2.052,2.5780000000000003

The happy hour deals are great, $3 beers, $4 sangrias, and $5 ""ultimate drinks"", among other deals. The appetizer deals used to be half off, now they're all $6, which, for many of their apps is only a dollar or so off the regular price.  The drinks are ok, and the appetizers are the usual chain restaurant fare: wings, potato skins, mozzarella sticks, etc. Their potstickers are pretty good, but they're a little pricey. Holly always takes great care of us, when we get another server its sort of hit or miss. You kind of get the feeling that they know we work in a restaurant as well, so they know they're gonna get a good tip. Holly, however, is a total sweetheart and has always given us great service.

400,H C.,"Union City, CA",0,23,40.0,4.0,2012-02-16,"Compared with Chili's, their 3 for $20 and 2 for $10 are comparable in value but gives me more versatility. The atmosphere is definitely more active and service a bit better than Chili's. And there was a bit more options here.   Maybe it is a Wednesday but, there were no real crowds and it was very safe without any rowdy bar crowds. To me however, I liked the Chili's steak dinner (2 for $20) than here (3 for $20) because Chili's steak was more tender and the mash potato more flavorful (maybe it was the bacon). However the dessert and service made up for that gap. I believe there eagerness for the grill marks or the way the steak was cut, ruined the steak for me. If you are really picky about the steak, at this price I would recommend Chili's (the nachos and guacamole was also good). However the flexibility and offerings is your thing, then this is a better place for the price. Because of the steak I wanted to give this place 3 stars, but the other aspects earn them an extra star.

301,Julie L.,"Sacramento, CA",493,259,140.0,3.0,2012-04-21,"Spending an evening with my friend Becca, we were in the mood for munchies 'n movies. We decided on a flick at @ Union City and had about 45 minutes to spare before the movie. Plenty of choices within the parking lot, we didn't feel the time crunch would be an issue. Even if we missed previews....an hour to spare? not bad at all.  This was during the week, not a weekend but still. It was 9ish pm & we first attempted to eat at pasta pomodoro, closed. Sushi place, closed. Fuddruckers, closed. TGI Fridays.... seated immediately.  That's when service took a nose dive. Did not even get greeted by any servers beyond the door person seating us for a good 10 minutes. Next, the server takes our drink orders (easy enough) 2 shirley temples. Ten more min. later he comes back with ""Here's your two waters!"" My reply- Ugh. Shirley Temples?  Oh yeah (haha, sorry) be right back. The overall order consisted of salad for me with a side of blue cheese crumbles. And an appetizer of pot stickers. In my opinion, easy enough to prepare and bring out. All of this took up nearly an hours worth. Even after bringing the food, the server forgot one LAST item. The silverware, no joke. I was so impatient I had practically eaten most of my salad finger-style before proper utensils arrived.  Very poor service. Not worth the efforts of being open later. We could've found more decent food options at the movie theatre itself.

We got seated promptly since we got there around 5pm, still early and not quite dinner time yet. Our waitress didn't get to our table until literally after 5 minutes later (seemed much longer than that).  By that time, we were ready to order our food, she took them promptly. At this time, there were no utensils/napkins on the table... which we saw all set up on the table across from us. Drinks showed up and so did the appetizer... still no utensils/napkins. Finally our entrees were being delivered... still no utensils/napkins, my wife asked for them.  Now at this point, I thought that our waitress would make getting the utensils her first priority... no stopping at other tables, just really quick get the utensils.  Or grab the ones from the other table for us.  It could have been a really quick fix. After waiting for a short while, she decided to grab 2 sets from the table across from us.  And then the waitress showed up with 2 sets of utensils... a little too late. After that things got better.  I'm guessing she was busy?  But still, what I see here is a lack of time/customer's management. Observing the rest of the crew, I saw many of them walked pass our table without even a slight glance and maybe only 1-2 of them were smiling. I understand that each waiter/waitress has his/her own designated tables, but they all still work for the same restaurant.  A bit better team work would've made things go much smoother.  Maybe help keep an eye out for customers who are ready to order or need something... relay it to the designated waiter/waitress.  Be eyes and ears for each other, instead of everyone for him/herself. Or maybe designate a person or two to do this 'spotting' job, engage the customers. Look and smile to all restaurant's customers, even when they are not on your designated tables.  It might seem so small and simple, but it can add a lot to the overall service impressions and atmosphere. As I stated above, the service did get better toward the end, also the reason why it's a 3-star review. People will always come for great service.  Many would even tolerate the food a bit if the service is great.  Fix the service, I can see this place getting more or updates to 4 stars (at least).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=360,2.4,2.57,2.57,2.444,2.502

It wasn't even that good either... Very microwaved, powdery, and tasteless. I tried to make up for it by ordering a red velvet cake.  ... How can you mess up red velvet cake? Why did it taste like dark chocolate and not red velvet light delicious spongey? Why am I eating in your shitty establishment? So many questions.  I'm sorry, the servers are awesome.

I just stood there awkwardly while the 2 hostess girls and one hostess (hoster?) dude talked and ignored me. Like what the fuck man I'm not that short. So I had to ask the guy cause we made eye contact how long the wait was. Then one of the girls answered me and said 10-15 min so I said okay cool and then they went back to talking to each other so I had to ask him if I'm supposed to wait or stand in line (it's been like 5 years since I've been to TGIF) and he said I had to write my name down. And then he just fucking stood there. So I told him to put 2 under my name and THEN he went and got the damn clipboard and put my name down. So after waiting for about 20 minutes we were finally seated.  Our server was nice and quick. Not very attentive cause it was so busy but what can you expect from a TGIF, right? Needless to say after we ate we got the fuck out of there asap. But yeah, the hostesses should be the main people to set the mood in the beginning and these hostesses did a horrible job. Singing and fooling around on the job while ignoring customers. It was really annoying. If I had more time I probably would have complained to the manager.

We were sitting at the table waiting for someone to take our order, no one bothered to stop by. We kept waiting. Finally someone came and took our order, appetizers came out within 10 minutes, after we finished, no one came and cleared the table. Entrees took over 30 minutes to come out. Once the entrees came out, my colleague had requested sweet potato fries instead of french fries, they gave her french fries. After being able to get the attention of the waiter, he brought out a dinky plate of sweet potato fries. Really now? The portion of the sweet potatoes was half of the portion of the french fries. Such a disappointment. The tables near us had the same experience. The waitress/waiters were not constant, we had other waitresses and waiters from other sections of the place to serve us.

At first it was really packed even on a Tuesday night and we thought we weren't going to get seats but luckily we found two tables that we could put together with a party of about 9 people.  Their Happy Hour selection is pretty good. Drinks are good and fairly priced and food is delicious and pretty cheap. Depending on the time you get there and what day you go on, it is usually packed near the area near the bar because of Happy Hour.  I would say my two favorite drinks on the Happy Hour menu is the Strawberry Margarita and the Mango Margarita. Both are fruity drinks and don't have much alcohol in them. They usually serve them with fruits as well. The food that I always get during Happy Hour because it is worth it because it is only $1.50 is the basket of fries. Had their loaded potato skins too and I have to say it wasn't that bad either for the amount they give you and the price of $4.50 because it was half off.

I know my steaks. They need to do their veggies better. Instead of steaming them. They should saute it with olive oil and garlic. Then maybe people will eat more healthier it if was done like that. My mom's dish was overcooked. Her steak was too dry hard to chew. Her lobster tail was way over cooked by a couple of minutes. It looked like a goofball not a lobster tail.

Been going to this place for more than 10 years and were decently satisfied with employees and food/drinks quality. However, we were turned into scapegoats thru conspiracy by the security guard and hostess' on our last visit. All seemed to be fine on this last night that we were there, the bar was closing around 2am, we were asked to close our tab, which we did and paid with a debit card. Meaning that funds had to be available for the damn thing to even go thru. FYI - about 15 mins before we paid and left, a group of patrons (also a party of 4) was asked to leave the restaurant as they were arguing and being rowdy in the restaurant. The security guard quickly escorted them out and let them go. Tons of people saw them leaving. 2 mins after we exited the parking lot of TGI's, Union City police stopped us for not paying our bill. We're like: ""is this a joke?"", but apparently it wasn't, the security guard and maybe other staff gave the cops our license plate number as the guilty party, when clearly everyone saw the other group of 4 create a ruckus and leave. We explained to the police exactly what happened, but management was unable to clarify this for almost 1 - 1.5 hours, we got home @ 4am that morning. How hard is it for cops to call a restaurant and ask the manager to go thru the last 5 - 10 merchant copies of signed receipts and clear up the matter. My inclination: the security guard was trying to make sure his friends could get as far away as possible while cops could harass an innocent party. SO, just in case your planning to be disrupted by rowdy crowds, harassed by cops and be conspired on by security guards employed here, feel free !

Service is ok the staff is friendly but last time I came two of them were arguing about some personal stuff. It was unprofessional and kind of annoying trying to get their attention. Jack Daniel chicken strips is a hit for me. Cheeseburger sliders not so much. Made me sick twice. Always check for happy hour. Appetizers are half off.

Then we sit down and order our drinks and appetizer. Our appetizer comes before our drinks. We have no water no drinks. Then our drinks come. Mind you we waited for our appetizer for ten minutes. Then we order our food food and I order the half rack of ribs and two sides like maria said. Also I forgot I ordered coffee at the very beginning of this. No coffee yet. I get my food and I have one side. So I ask maria and she says oh there is only one side. I look at her like... wtf... so in a bit she brings me the other side of mine and says.. I shit you not she says ""well next time know that this dish comes with one side"".... really arent you supposed to know... not me... Then she comes and asks if we want any more to drink and i ask for my coffee again.  Finally we ask for our bill. The bill comes and I steal it from my friend who thinks he is going to pay... I look at the bill and my coffee isn't there. Good one good thing out of the night she is going to give me free coffee for her crappy service. The bill is $57 and some change. I give her my card and away goes my bill. It comes back for me to sign and it say $60 and some change... HUH?? I look, there is my coffee on there. Well that's it, here's my tip $1 (which i have never ever done, i tip 15-20% because I know how hard servers work) and I write Thanks for the slow service. I walk out and my friend goes and talks to the manager. Well, the manager, Teressa was a really pleasant lady to speak to he said.  She was really apologetic.

434,Ruth A.,"Union City, CA",32,58,34.0,1.0,2013-04-22,"Thought we'd get there early and celebrate my kids' bdays. Got there around 4:30 and the place was clearly not busy at all. No one in the front to greet and  take you to your seats. Took about 3-5 minutes. Got seated and I discreetly asked if they do something special for bdays and told her that we're celebrating two. She smiled and said she'll take care of it. There were only four of us so it wasn't like we're keeping her busy. Got the drinks and appetizer just fine. Took a little longer for the entrees. Food was just okay...nothing special. But the service was clearly lacking when you can't even get drink/water refills. Server came around once, probably after we'd each taken a bite or two to check on us. That was the last time. We sat around a long time after we'd all finished our meals, when someone else (not our server) asked about dessert. I guess our server totally forgot about the bday celebrants. I asked for a couple of minutes to peruse the dessert menu. Kids picked out what they wanted, then our original server came around 15 minutes later. We ordered dessert (still didn't jog her memory and I didn't bother mentioning it 'coz it would take away the element of surprise) & asked for water refills. Before she could move too far away, she asked a colleague if she could get us water. The other's reply was ""I've got people in the front"" & turned her back. 30 minutes later, we finally got our dessert--a couple of ice cream-filled oreos served on a plate with choc/caramel drizzle. 30 minutes!!! At this point I got up to take a look around. Sure...other patrons but definitely not crowded, especially when you see 4-5 servers standing around in the soda station chatting...but no one could be bothered to give us water refills!  We picked this place 'coz the kids said that out of all the places in Union Landing, we haven't gone back to this one in a while-- at least a couple of years. Now we all remember why.

When they arrived, they were cold, and the jalapenos were NOT on the side, like we had requested. 30 seconds later all of our food arrived. My husband got the wrong side, and his ribs were only warm. My crunchy parm crusted chicken had sat under the heat lamp and was neither crunchy nor hot. Room temp is being kind. The sauce on the side of tortellini was all glazed over, like it had been sitting for too long, and the tortellini was borderline cold. My daughter's mac and cheese was only just warm, and the broccoli was cold.  With an antsy one and two year old, who had been waiting for food for 40 minutes at this point, we opted to just eat it, but I complained. The server was apologetic, as was the manager, and he removed the nachos and ribs from the bill. That was nice of him, but still.... it was a waaaay disappointing meal.

It was pretty empty but is was 11AM. We weren't expecting it to be busy. It was pretty clean. No messy tables. Our waitress was pleasant. It took us about an hour to order. We hadn''t spoken to each other for so long that we were catching up and had no time to look at the menu. Our waitress was kind enough to wait and she frequently checked on us to see if we were ready. I ordered the korean wraps, my friend got the salmon and my other friend got the fettuccine. We all had some mozzarella sticks for the appetizer. They were good but i wish they offered more sauce. korean wraps were BOMB!!! I'd order them again. It doesn't come with hot sauce and I had requested some. She said they only had tabasco and wing sauce. she said the wingsauce was pretty hot and I told her I don't mind as long as its okay for me to have some. she brought both of them and i ended up just using the wing sauce. it sure was hot and i only used it sparingly. but it didn't add that kick it needed. if you like spicy i recommend you requesting the sauce its so good!!! i was very happy that the accommodated to my needs. the beef was cooked well it wasn't tough. it came iwth a side of rice and had some cilantro in it. i was kinda confused about it since it was on the side. i guess you can add some in your wrap or eat it on the side. i did both. and it both worked. Its a pretty healthy meal. not friend or drenched in cheese. i was very content with the portion too. DEFINITELY WILL ORDER AGAIN. I had a bit of my friends salmon and shrimp. It was pretty watery.

MY ADVISE IS IF YOU PLAN TO USE A COUPON, DON'T COME HERE We always wanted to try eat in here and we finally did because we received coupon in mail for buy 1 entree and get 1 free with 2 orders of beverage. Perfect! After we sat down, the waitress greeted us. Then I showed her my coupon and asked if I could use it. The waitress told me ""sure you can use the coupon but you can not use it to order anything with lobster on the entree menu."" I double check the coupon but it doesn't has restriction listed for entree choice. We didn't know there is restriction and we wanted to order the entrees with lobster. I asked why we couldn't use it for lobster and the waitress told me their manager told them that but she can ask her manager see if they allow us to use it this time. After a minute, she came back after asking the manager and told us her manager said we can use it for THIS TIME ONLY .. (OK.. good)  We ordered  Appetizer: BBQ chicken flat bread $10 Entree: lobster & ribeye entree $24 Entree: lobster & ribs entree $22 Off the entree menu: we ordered a burger  $12 Drink: Gold Medalist $3.5 Drink: Another fruit drink $3.5 After placed the order the waitress told us they can only free the Burger because it free the cheapest entree out. I told her the burger isn't even from the entree menu, are you kidding me? I re-read the coupon to her that says buy 1 entree and get 1 free with 2 beverages equal or less value.  My dad got angry and asked what if we need to split the check will we get the second lobster entree free then? The waitress said yes if we don't mind doing it and she will ask her manager if that is OK. After a minute she came back and said she got it taken care of. (OK again.. fine) We finished our meal and I asked for check. The waitress really brought us two bills to free our 2nd lobster entree. I tried to pay with credit card but I waited 10 minutes the waitress never came back to pickup the check. After 10 minutes someone looks like their manager in red shirt asked if this is ready. I said yes and asked if I could use same credit card to pay for both bills. Then he misunderstood me and thought I asked if I wanted to them to put two bills back into one. So he did it for me.. OK so he just put two bills back into one after the waitress tried so hard with her ideas to stop us from using the coupon and not letting us order the entree that has lobster.... TGIF Management, if you don't want your customer to use your coupon then don't send me the freaking coupon in mail. You want your customer feel embarrassing for using a coupon then you did it.

By the end of the meal, the service was so horrible and we were so hungry, we were almost not even friends anymore lol. When we arrived, we put our name down on the waitlist. I stood outside the front doors for us to get called. About 15 minutes later, I walked in again to check on our table, the host gave me mad attitude and told me he had already called our table and next time I should stand closer to the restaurant. Excuse me? I was right outside the front door, maybe you should use your legs and go check. Wtf? I actually mentioned out loud that I had been right outside, and he gave me a death stare. Then he proceeds to seat us at the back most table next to the bathrooms and the kitchen. Again, WTF? Next, our waiter was ""on a break"" so we got another waitress taking our order. She put in our order (we ordered nachos) and almost 40 minutes later, they came... that too COLD. I ordered a drink, which she never brought, and then after I asked our REAL waiter to cancel my drink, it magically had already been made and given to me. Then we ordered a salad, again, it took another 30 minutes for a simple SALAD to arrive. We didn't even eat it, we had to box it up and leave. Our waiter was not at all apologetic, and he barely came by to check on us. He pretty much ignored us everytime he went to the kitchen... hmm maybe it had something to do with the crappy seating. Overall, I am not cool with this place. I don't like spending my money on a useless meal with terrible service. I could cook better food and be happy eating in.

120,Evelynn C.,"San Francisco, CA",827,366,884.0,2.0,2013-11-25,"I'm still quite baffled by how much quality has gone down over the years at this particular Friday's restaurant. I used to be such a big fan of T.G.I. Friday's, I might even have called it my favorite restaurant. Unfortunately from my past visits, I have slowly watched the quality slowly die.  Last night (Sunday), Friday's was crowded, but it wasn't exceptionally crowded. We were able to be seated within 10-15 minutes vs. the 30-40 min wait we were used to. Which is good. Except -- after we were seated, we had to wait another 15 minute before a waiter came by and introduced himself and asked us if we wanted anything to drink, by then all four of us had already decided what we wanted to eat for dinner. Meanwhile, we watched 4-5 different waiters/waitresses walk past our table serving everyone else food. - 1 5 min later, he brought us our drinks, there was something in my drink. But he noticed it as soon as he put it down on the table, which is good. Except after he brought me a new drink, there was still something inside... -1 Another 10-15 min went by and we all got our orders. Reasonable amount of wait time at a Friday's restaurant, so I figured what the heck, no complaints here. Except my sirloin that I ordered medium well was super well done, dry, and difficult to chew/swallow. My mom's, on the other hand, was ordered well done but her's was juicy and semi-bloody. Either the chef/waiter got it mixed up, or they have consistency issues. Either way, -1. Also my GRILLED shrimp was cold and flavorless, and my sweet potato fries amounted to barely a small handful.  Waiter overall polite enough, not especially friendly or memorable. It really used to be whenever my parents asked where I wanted to go for dinner, I would by default answer ""Fridays!"" But now, I have several choices, and it's usually not Friday's anymore.  Verdict: Would go, but only rarely.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=120,2.32,2.43,2.484,2.184,2.386

I'm really sad that my experience there wasn't an episode of Kitchen Nightmares, because God knows I felt like that's what I was experiencing.  Biggest rule for anyone eating anything: IF YOUR BODY WANTS IT OUT IMMEDIATELY, THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH IT. First you meet the horribly unprofessional and ill-mannered hosts/hostesses. That is, after you go seek them out to put you on a list, where the hell are they anyway?! They don't greet anyone! Wtf! Most of the time they were arguing with other hosts and servers. ARGUING LOUDLY. And there's no way to distinguish who is waiting, who has their name on a list, or anything because you're supposed to wait for your seat in the tiny doorway, so people are coming in asking us, ""How do we get on the list?"" Dear god. Then, as they are calling names, half of the people on there have already left anyway. But instead of going down the list, they cross the name off and walk away. Wtf? Empty tables, 15 people waiting. So we finally get seated and meet the only nice person there, our waitress. But then the food comes (not quickly). Oh noooooo... First, you have to pay for bread, which is the first indication of a horrible restaurant. The ""garlic parmesan breadsticks"" have NO seasoning, let alone cheese on them. I got better breadsticks at the pizza place outside of my high school. Then, my lemonade comes and it is MINUTE MAID. Ewww!! My date and I both ordered burgers. These weren't just ordinary burgers. THIS WAS BURGER SOUP! WOW. The bottom of the bun on both of our burgers were COMPLETELY soaked through, sopping pieces of bun that ripped as soon as we picked it up for the first bite.  Now, I'm not one of those people who is afraid of any kind of food, or afraid of certain textures or anything. And I DON'T have a queasy stomach. I eat Mexican and Indian food with no problem. So believe me when I say this food was DISGUSTING. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. I tried to eat it, I really did especially because they charge $12 for a damn burger. But less than halfway through, I had to go to the bathroom because my stomach wanted it out out out! Looking in the toilet I found that my shit looked just like the sopping mess that was on my plate. Lol. So instead of going back to my table, I had to get straight out the door of this terrible place. Even Denny's has burgers that are better and cheaper and more liable to stay intact than this shit was.

But first of all the appetizer : TUSCAN SPINACH DIP is pretty darned good. We ordered it both times on both visits. Its yummy.  I think we might have even ordered a double for that. So on both occasions we ordered off the Jack Daniels menu. She ordered the JACK DANIEL'S® RIBS & SHRIMP and I was hungry and ordered the JACK DANIEL'S® MIXED GRILL* Hella good on both! Very tasty. My GF is from Beijing and this menu is one of her favorites when she comes stateside. Its a treat for her so she doesnt mind doubling up on it. LOL!  And for dessert, we shared the SALTED CARAMEL CAKE, that was good. The previous night we shared VANILLA BEAN CHEESECAKE Made with real vanilla beans, layered with white chocolate mousse and baked in a graham cracker crust. Topped with white chocolate shavings.  A little too sweet but washed it down with lots of water and a cup of coffee! LOL! This is a good place. Very quick service and the food gets to you quicker than the other places in that mall. Maybe the only other one is Appleby's, which I think is a notch down from this place IMO.  no complaints from us and this is from two different visits in the same week. Will go back here for sure and will recommend to anyone in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=340,2.32,2.39,2.528,2.0280000000000005,2.362

Took off a star because of the table next to me.. Ugh! Super annoying!! Came in towards the end of our meal but that didn't matter - they were drunk in minutes and hitting on the other waitresses.

211,Michael D.,"Fremont, CA",14,8,5.0,3.0,2014-08-26,"I went here recently with a couple friends to grab some all-you-can-eat appetizers. We went in pretty late, proabably between 10pm and 11pm. Almost no wait to get seated, which was cool - and not always the case at this location. Everyone in the restaurant was just hanging out it seemed. Not much energy in the air, though. The hostess was nice enough to let us wait for a booth seat, and then take it once her busser was done cleaning it up. That got some brownie points, for sure :). However, we already knew what we wanted and we had no clue who our server was. We inquired with the hostess, who wasn't much help, then I asked another server to help us out and he said he'd let our server know. After a bit of waiting, I finally saw our server approach the booth next to ours, so we finally flagged her down...but then we had to wait while she prepped for a birthday at the table across from us. It took a really long time for her to get things ready and finally come out for the really short birthday song - quite unenethusiastic as those go by the way. Then she FINALLY come and took our order. At this point, we had been waiting about 20 minutes already... The fried mozzarella sticks were very good in my opinion, the buffalo wings were slightly above average. Better with the scorching hot sauce plus the buffalo sauce! The potato skins, however, were terrible. The three of us all started reminiscing about Elephant Bar's potato skins ON THE SPOT! Pass on the potato skins - they're  HUGE let-down! After the huge disappointment, our server was nice enough to let us get the Bruschetta, which was SURPRISINGLY GOOD!!! I usually hate bruschetta, especially from places like this. It's usually too stale with not enough good toppings. The bread was just right, and the toppings were very good, especially the tomatoes. The server stepped it up for sure after the long wait, and a couple of the items were quite good, so this balanced out to 3 stars for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=220,2.44,2.44,2.54,1.9960000000000002,2.44

That's almost an hour to see food from time of arrival. Bf ordered steak medium rare and it came out well done. We asked for it to be replaced and it took another 20 minutes.

We chose the bar because I wanted to watch the game and get my drinks faster. We ordered some buffalo wings and a couple budweisers from the HH menu. Thinking we'd make the movies on time ..  For a first time EVER at a TGIF's .. this place proved EVERYTHING anybody has ever said in regards to the chain to be true. Food is bland and overpriced .. that's about it. It has a bar and the ambiance looks a little higher quality than applebee's but .. that's about it.  Buffalo Wings - I looked at it a good minute before eating it .. and that's a good minute on top of already being late for the movies. So it's from some scrawny chicken - that's fine. I think they oven roast it then twirl it around in some buffalo sauce .. because the drumsticks and wings weren't just small, they were pretty much dehydrated and on their way to being burnt, too.  Service - The girls were nice. They didn't seem to care for being at work, though. Smiled and everything but it was late and they were working - it just makes sense.  Left the place leaving a 20something % tip because our bartender/server was really nice and did her best to smile every time she asked us if we were okay.

252,Julie L.,"Fremont, CA",0,33,28.0,1.0,2014-11-06,"This review is about Edgar for his unwelcoming and poor service.  I arrived at this location for a quick late night meal. It was 2 hours before closing on a weekday, it was not busy at all. The place itself was clean and the environment was welcoming.  My friend and I were immediately seated and given menus by Edgar. He returned shortly with our orders of water and while we were still obviously looking at our menus, rushed us by asking what we wanted. After politely explaining to him that more time was needed, he left us alone for a full 15 minutes (yes I timed this) and by the time he returned I was starving. Again, keep in mind that this was not a busy night. I ordered my sirloin medium and was returned with a well-done tough piece of meat that had obviously been sitting out. The reasons I have for this is that 1) the jack Daniels burger my friend ordered was beyond soggy, room temperature, and falling apart when he received his and 2) my sirloin was room temperature and felt like it had just been warmed up. The lack of quick execution of our meal was no big deal to me at first because hey, everyone has a bad day right? Again, Edgar proved his incompetence by leaving us alone for the rest of the night, walking past our table several times and being unaware that we were ready for our check. After we finally received the bill did I see any pleasantries from this gentleman, which made me feel as if he were happy we were finally leaving or happy that he was about to receive his tip.  It takes a lot to bother me and I still provided  Edgar with a tip that I soon realized should not have been given to him at all.  As my friend and I walked to our car, I looked through a window on the left side of the restaurants main entrance. Who do I see? Edgar with his hand inappropriately groping his girlfriends ass while watching the basketball game. He may have been on his break or off work, but displaying this conduct out in the open where customers can assume the worst is unprofessional. Images of his hands touching my food made me cringe. For crying out loud, have you no shame Edgar? Is this behavior okay for you to present to young children who may walk by at any second? Is this the reason why your service was terrible and had a lack of speed? This is what made me upset and prompted me to write a review. Edgar is an embarrassment to this restaurant, so much that I would never think to revisit this place or any other tgi Friday's restaurants. Usually one person doesn't make me hate a place because that seems unfair, but it makes me so angry to know that this man is still hired and allowed to tarnish a restaurants reputation.

Boyfriend got a beer, can't review because, come on, how do you ruin what's on tap? I had the 6 oz. Sirloin, medium, cut it open and grimaced. It was like I cooked it. Clearly the chef didn't watch enough Food Network or even read his menu because medium has a pink center. I saw none of the sort. I thought it was the lighting so I took a bite. Nope, tasted well done. So much for flavor.  I had the side of cheddar mac and cheese with mashed potatoes. How could you ruin either? Taters were fine, but the mac and cheese was dry.

So we stood inside for a few minutes before she came to ask us where we wanted to sit. We sat at a booth and ordered some appetizers before our friends arrived. When they arrived we realized that the booth wasn't big enough for all of us so we told our waitress we were going to switch tables. She said it was fine but we were going to have a new server.  So we moved tables and no one let anyone know that we had moved so we sat around waiting for about half an hour before asking the hostess if she could find out waitress. Another 15 minutes and we asked one of the other waitresses if we could order who also told us just to wait a minute to find her. Once we found her she promptly apologized for not coming since she saw our appetizers and thought we had been served already.  She was great and nice. But after already waiting almost an hour just to be served the food took way too long. Then for some reason they decided to turn up the volume on the music so loud that we had to yell at each other.  None of the other waitresses seemed to be doing anything that didn't involved their own tables. When we left they were all standing in a circle by the front door just chit chatting and no one greeted or said bye to anyone in our group.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=220,2.12,2.32,2.46,1.6360000000000001,2.24

It was close enough to my high school and now it's where all the food is. There's not really places to hang out in Hayward, and here, we get a movie theatre and several food options.  Choosing TGIF was kind of a spontaneous decision amongst my group of 10 and we came in at around 4. The wait was around 5 mins even though there was literally no one there... we were seated and served pretty well, until we ordered. Food took forever to arrive, around 30 minutes despite not being rush hour. I was a bit disappointed honestly. I expected food to be of somewhat decent quality, but their brocolli on my dragonfire shrimp wasn't fresh. Rice was of questionable quality too. My friend ordered the firecracker shrimp and her cole slaw just looked like someone pulled it from the bottom of the fridge.

That's how Boyfriend, myself, and a mutual friend of ours ended up here on a Monday night for dinner. We ordered the baked potato skins unlimited appetizer and then, sadly, each of us also ordered an entree as well. The potato skins were over-fried to the point that they were beyond crispy -- they were essentially burnt. We only got 2 plates (though we could've had unlimited plates) of them because they were so hard to eat. Our friend's Jack Daniel's burger wasn't cooked enough to her taste (she asked for medium-well, I believe) so she only ate about half of it. My parmesan-crusted chicken was stiff and dry. The mac and cheese was okay, so I ate that, but I was pretty weirded out by the ""fresh tomato and mozzarella salad."" I didn't think it would literally be little cherry tomatos and globs of mozzarella cheese (looked like they had used the cold insides of their mozzarella sticks). I think Boyfriend ordered the Jack Daniel's chicken sandwich and he was disappointed by the lack of chicken in the sandwich (there was so much more bread than there was meat). I used to come here for late-night drinks and appetizers to share with groups when I was younger (see: freshly 21) and they seemed alright then. Maybe I've just grown up and my tastes have changed. We had the gift card, so we had to use it.

My younger sister and I just finished having dinner at around 9:30 PM at Tadamasa so we decided to go walk at Wal-Mart and buy some thank you cards to send out for our mom's wedding from last week.  We bought our cards and decided to stay at that McDonald's to write the cards so we can get them out of the way.  While we were there, we had a few unwelcome visitors stop by so as soon as we were done with the last card, we hurried our little behinds out of there and started searching for a nearby spot to hang out and chat.  When we found out that TGIF doesn't close until 1:30 AM, we made our way over. As soon as we both walked in, we were sweetly greeted by the hostess.  She was about to show us to our table, but since we had just eaten, we just asked if it would be ok for us to just sit at the bar.  She looked at us and smiled.  She told us she'll check and brought back a guy to check our ID's.  We were both surprised, and thought she was so cute that we'd need to be carded since my sister and I are both in our 30's.  She already gets 5-stars right off the bat.  Lol Once we made our way to the bar, we were sweetly greeted by our bartender, Rabi.  He asked us what we wanted to drink and I asked for a virgin pina colada and my younger sister asked for a vanilla shake.  He was probably thinking ""what the heck are these women ordering?""  Lol But he was so sweet and just smiled and told us he would have our drinks in a few minutes.  I don't think they normally even make vanilla shakes, but he made it for us any way... We ordered two appetizers, even though we already had dinner not too long ago.  The bacon mac n cheese bites was on the salty side, but the Tuscan spinach dip was actually good.  Although the tostada strips smelled like it was deep fried in old cooking oil. I would normally rate the food at a 2, but the service definitely kicks it up to a 4-star.  Being that we were seated at the bar and ordered non alcoholic beverages, the bartender was still sweet and friendly.  He checked on us multiple times to make sure we were doing alright and according to my younger sister, she says ""we'll definitely be back if Rabi is working.""  Lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=100,2.04,2.35,2.444,2.064,2.2260000000000004

Our server, Sadia was fantastic! She got me a beer at happy hour price even though we were seated less than 5 minutes before it ended which I do appreciate. We then told her that we wanted to do endless apps so she came back with a special menu. I'm not quite sure why they don't just include it with the main menu, but once she brought it out, she explained how it works. There are 2 sides to this special menu. The $10 side lets you pick any one item and they will continue to only bring that item until you are full. But for $2 more, ($12) you flip the menu and you can choose between boneless wings, mozzarella sticks, potato skins, pot stickers, etc. and switch between any of them until you are full.  If you are dining in with friends, my suggestion is to pay $10 for the wings and all of the different flavors and then pay $12 to try out the other apps. As long as you order 1 extra refill, it's already worth it! Overall, the food was pretty good and the service was quite fast on Wednesday. Highlight of the night was Sadia!

Ordered the sampler plate and for appetizers it was filling and big enough to share with everyone. The crab cakes were not up to standard though. Over seasoned and mushy.

I see the happy hour menu that is all day Sunday and understand why the crowd is how it is, ghetto in all its glory.  The waitress was nice but has no clue about the food or menu. Starters were good and got there quick. Nachos were small for a chain restaurant but were tasty, great boneless buffalo wings, potato skins and mozzarella sticks. The artichoke dip was also good but not enough chips which after asking they brought more. The new jack sampler is generous, the new jack sliders yummy, We asked about vegetarian options for my daughter and dumbly the waitress said we don't have anything vegetarian. We only have a black bean hamburger  lol, #clueless. I also asked her if the dish I was asking for had ""caprese salad"" because I couldn't make it out from the picture in the menu and she said no ""its basil, tomatoes and mozzarella"" once again  lol!!! The chips the show on the menu didn't come with the dip and the portion of my plate was smaller than what you saw on the menu. The rice and the steak with the langostino lobster was delicious just small. My kids enjoyed their burgers as well and my husband.

Any later, we would have definitely had to wait for seats. This place fills up quickly! We asked for the endless app menu. For $10, you can pick one appetizer and refill that same one as many times as you want. For $12, you pick an appetizer, and then refill with appetizers of your choice. If you go in a big group like I did, you can do multiple $10 options and share with your friends. What a steal! -Mozzarella sticks: Crispy and cheesy -Spinach Florentine Flatbread: Tasty but very filling -Pan-Seared Potstickers: More like dumplings because they didn't pan fry them enough -Beef Tostadas: Tasty but the tostada was pretty hard -Boneless Wings: You can never go wrong with Garlic Parmesan and BBQ. However, Ghost Pepper was definitely my favorite - spicy but super flavorful. The PB&J totally tastes like Thai curry, which I surprisingly enjoyed. Every 15 minutes or so, we got rounds of the appetizers I just listed. I think we did about 6-7 rounds and we were stuffed!

I had never been before last week, but had seen commercials about their amazing appetizers, so I thought what the heck.  The bar was bustling and busy. There were a few sports games going on. We sat in the bar surrounded by several televisions. Too bad I'm not a sports fan because it would have been a dream come true.  It was happy hour, so my friend and I got two margaritas. I got the Mango Berry blended and loved it. I do highly recommend that drink. Got me pretty buzzed as well. Pretty generous in alcohol.  For apps, we tried the mozzarella sticks, ahi tuna chip bites, and the sesame chicken tenders.  - the mozzarella sticks were fine. Nothing special.  - the ahi tuna was a mess. It wasn't seared properly, and ended up getting the chip soggy. The fish was grisly and you couldn't take a clean bite without struggling with the fish. Good flavor but technically a flop.  - the chicken was great. Good flavor and crispy on the outside. However, they were on the border of being burnt they were so dark.  I also ordered the clam chowder. Not pleased. It had a weird flavor and color. I could barely taste the clams either.  I would return for drinks a few of the apps (after carefully reading reviews next time), but I will most likely not order from the meal menu considering my friend did not like her pasta dish and I really disliked the clam chowder.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=140,2.6,2.15,2.332,2.152,2.33

Once we got seated we were greeted by a very friendly server named Gregg. He took our order and helped me with a drink choice. Which I ordered a blended Mango and strawberry Margarita. It tasted great!  My husband ordered the Jack Daniels ribeye with mash potatoes and broccoli. The ribeye was a little tough but to be expected since our first choice was Texas Roadhouse and they were packed.  I ordered a shrimp cocktail and a back potato. The shrimps were slightly over cooked and they are certainly not prawns but the average size you normally see.

83,Dararith L.,"San Leandro, CA",52,97,32.0,5.0,2016-07-14,"I can't possibly fathom why TGI's currently averages 2.5 stars on Yelp.  It's a restaurant chain that easily outclasses its other competitors within its league of similar price range and food type, you know...Applebees, Chili's, etc.  Based on that comparison, I'll be reviewing under that pretext. Allow me to tip the scale a bit. For your typical run of the mill, All-American, fast, sit-down restaurant, TGI's is splendid.  On numerous occasions, I enjoyed the New York steak, ribeye, full rack of pork ribs, shrimp, Bourbon Barrel Mahi Mahi, top sirloin steak, all coupled with potatoes, sweet potato fries (real good!), fresh vegetables, and spinach/garlic.  Veggies are cooked well (nothing special though), and steaks are actually served medium rare like I asked, every time.  And honestly, I think their Jack Daniel's Signature BBQ sauce delicious and goes with just about everything.   They even have calories listed on the menu for each meal for the calorie conscious, and frankly, I think the portions are just fine since I can finish it comfortably.  I can eat a ton more, but the typical American diet has average meals easily in the caloric surplus.  Of course, I'm not one to judge anyone's gluttony, but I'm digressing.  I guess one can argue the price point, but this goes back to other restaurants within the same league that are of similar price.  The difference?  The food quality of TGI's is easily in the upper band; it just tastes better.  Also, service has been attentive every time and the cocktail selection is numerous. What else is there to judge for a restaurant of this caliber?  Despite the welcoming name to come on Fridays, don't.  Especially on a Friday evening -- place is packed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=100,3.08,2.48,2.364,2.516,2.72

My friends got steaks and those steaks were also horrible.  I think that for a $45 bill per person that is completely unacceptable.

My husband and I came here after a long work day and ordered our usual appetizer, Jack Daniel's chicken strips.  When our order came, my husband and I looked at each other like ""wtf?"" Did they drop the other half on the way to the table or something?  When our server came back, we asked why our order was so skimpy. She replied ""I'm sorry, I know... they rip you off here"" and then asked what else we needed. Ummm okay.  Not very professional. I was starving so I started eating the sad looking appetizer.  Fast forward to the bill.... damn chicken was $11.  My husband handed the bill and his card to the server and I asked to speak to the manager... I'm not one to complain or make a huge deal about things but the appetizer was almost the price of my entrée, which would be fine if I had gotten the whole order.  The ""manager"" walks over to the table already looking irritated. I explain to him why I was disappointed in the meal and how they need to be consistent with their portions. I told him we are regulars and have never received a portion so small.  He says portions are always the same and blah blah... but he says he will take them off the bill pretty much rolling his eyes and walks off. Our server came seconds later handing my husband the original check for him to sign. My husband notices that the price on the check is more then the one she had given him before he put his card. I believe it was a $4 difference. So when the manager comes back with the new tab.. I show him the two different checks from the server and he pretty much snatches them from my hand and tells me to forget that tab because he brought a new one. This passes me off because he's not even trying to explain how she was gonna show me one total and then charge my husband another. He tries to get an attitude, and my husband had to tell him to not come at me like that. I never raised my voice or came at him crazy.  He finally apologized and says he doesn't know how why she did that. Half a**. Worst service ever.  Pay attention to your tabs when coming here. Oh, and your portions.

Don't get me wrong I like jack Daniels sauce and I still ate it and it tasted ok, but it just doesn't seem like people cared all that much of what they were serving.

We came in on a Tuesday night at 8pm. It looked like it might be busy, lots of cars in the parking lot. We were told to wait 5-10mins to be seated, so we thought ok thats not too bad. 15 mins go by and we looked at the seating area, and there were SO many open tables, pretty much everywhere it was empty except the bar area where they kept telling people they could sit. 8 men came in and they were directed to that area because of ""lack of seating""....thats a large party, why would you want them crammed in the bar, where they might not order as much due to lack of table space? Loosing $$ for sure by doing this. One mom and daughter were ahead of us, they looked like they had been waiting a while and they finally got seated about 5 mins before us. We should have left after we saw them walk out about 5 mins later shaking their heads. After they left, they sat us at a dirty table (when there were TONS of clean tables already set next to us). The girl said your server will be here shortly...another almost 5 mins go by and no server so I press the ""call server"" button on the tablet at the table. We gave it another 5 mins and then my husband and I were so fed up we walked out too. We went to Chevy's near by and were immediately seated, given menus and food in the same amount of time that it took for us just to walk out of TGI Friday's. We have both worked in food service (for many many years) and this was just unacceptable. Its not like they were short staffed, there were 3 girls standing up front talking, and then occasionally a male server as well. Plus we saw about 6 other servers zipping about, but when you have 4 servers standing up front for 20 mins talking you have a management and staff problem. My recommendation to management (having management experience myself): Keep an eye on your FOH staff, they are not doing their jobs and you are loosing customers as a result.

I did not can not remember the name of the waitress that was supposed to be takimg care of us as she left a horrible impression as she visit our table twice during the hour that we were there. She got our order wrong and brought us cold coffee which took 5 minutes for us to get it back. Our order started to come out come staggered. Nothing arrived at the table at the dame time. Does it make any sense that our appetizers came during the meal rather than prior to? We ordered plain pasta but it came with peppers. We ordered fish and chips and the coleslaw was very weird looking so we switched it for mac and cheese (which never arrived to our table). We also ordered a sizzling cheese and srimp plate, which never arrived either. Typically refills are brought out in new glasses but not here, my coffee xup was clearly stained with my lipstick however the waitress still look the cup into the back and brought it back out refilled with coffee but no additional creamer. Our table was loaded with menus that were never taken away and dirty dishea that we had to lift onto the window seal to sit comfortably. Our waitress did not come back to our table to check on us or to see if we needed anything, she just came for drink orders and food orders. The resturant was very empty when we had arrived so it cant be that they were packed. For the hour that we were there, just about 8 other tables were filled; so the lack of service surely couldnt have been due to being over packed.

Our recent trip to TGI was both interest and gift card based- I mean, a meal on someone else- why not? :) We came on Thursday and there was a bit of a busy lobby. The hostess told us it would be a 25 minute wait, and took our contact information to text us when our table was ready. The ease of contact was so convenient and made it easy for us to wait in the car without having an obnoxious vibrating buzzer interrupting. Or, the germs those carry! At about 21 minutes through, we received a text message and were ready to eat! Our waitress was beautiful and fun, her name was Marjorie and she was very attentive and friendly. Within 2 minutes of ordering drinks, she brought it our way, and was very quick on her feet.  For our appetizer we ordered the mozarella sticks which were sold out! My dream of fresh ones was foiled, but next time I will plan to come at an earlier time in the day. In substitution we ordered potato skins and requested the bacon to be excluded from the recipe. Marjorie put in our order and ten minutes after, we're munching on our potato skins telling her things were great between a mouthful of cheese!  The potato skins were very good, I preferred them with ketchup to the sour cream, but they were the only dish lacking presentation. The cheese used is a kraft or packaged sliced cheese, making it look a bit 'at home' like, but nonetheless, very tasty! Next time, we will order mozarella sticks though, the potatoes weren't much to write home about. Our main entree was burger themed! According to Yelp reviews here, there was no consistency with what to order , so we gambled on burgers.  My boyfriend ordered the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger, and I ordered the Black Bean Chipotle Burger! I totally appreciated that being a quality vegetarian option, since the pasta dishes were covered in chicken or meat, making it a bit difficult to find some good options with protein. Not even fifteen minutes after our appetizer, we receive our entrees - which was surprisingly fast! The staff really makes sure the customers are fed and not irritable, which was completely appreciated.  My boyfriend's seal of approval was cleaning his plate and nodding with a smile! I couldn't believe it! My burger was very well made. The bun used is a sweet roll similar to Hawaiian bread, with a mild chipotle mayo sauce combination, lettuce, avocado, tomato, onion, on the black bean burger. The combination was both flavorful, and satisfying, taking into account that many vegetarian options are blander or very unseasoned. :) I was pleasantly surprised! For anyone looking to order this meal, it tastes like black beans and a soft bean veggie mix- so if you're looking for a meat alternative TASTING like meat, this wouldn't be a good substitute but it's just as tasty! For dessert we ordered the fudge brownie with vanilla bean icecream! I imagined a more structured foundation of brownie, but it was more pudding/molten lava fudge mixed with brownie pieces so it's very very soft. Less cakey! The vanilla icecream was mildly sweet staying true to vanilla flavor, not overwhelmingly sweet like artificial icecream. What's great is all desserts are similarly priced so there's no loss in money or choices. Overall we give TGI four stars for amazing service, and food. We both agreed upon leaving we would definitely return, which was a big plus! Marjorie is super sweet and friendly, she's like a total gal pal that has the hookup with great food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city,2.64,2.51,2.364,2.352,2.5620000000000003

Perhaps the cook should take the damn survey so that I can get taken care of because this was their error not mines. My survey is this yelp review that this place consistently gives poor service.

I haven't been to TGI Friday's since 2007, and it was the location that used to be in Cupertino, and I do not remember it being like this. I suppose this may be a franchise location, or the quality of food and service has diminished for this establishment over the last decade. I brought my mom here for dinner, as she has never been to a Fridays and I remember them being ok (well, was about to look like a fool for suggesting this place...) We walked in, and no one in sight,except for customers. We waited about three minutes to be seated to a table with fresh drink rings left on the table as well as someones leftover dessert on my moms side.They didnt bother to wipe it down until she asked about halfway through our dinner. Strangely enough, we were given different menus. Apparently,there is an old one and a revised one, which is shorter. We noticed when half of the pages were missing from hers. We asked the waiter about it and that is what he told us, before switching out the old one. I ordered a burger with a side of mayo as well as a salad and a side of loaded mashed potatoes. The food would come out all together.The salad came out with the food (WTF) The burger came with no mayo, which was the only thing that I had asked for on it. And the mashed potatoes, were not loaded, they were not mashed really. They were INSTANT potatoes? At a restaurant? For an additional $3? Really? They couldn't get anything right on this visit and I refuse to go back due to the quality of food. Check out this picture that I couldn't help but take of the loaded mashed potatoes that I was given,what a joke, just like TGI Fridays in Union City",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city,2.48,2.56,2.384,1.7320000000000002,2.528

The wait wasn't that long, only about 30 minutes for Sunday @6pm. I think it helped that we were waiting seated inside because the hostess was aware of our presence and seated us sooner than I had anticipated. They now have ipad type machines on each of the tables that I assume you can order and play games on. Ours was broken so I don't know why it wasn't just removed (it took up a lot of unnecessary space!)  The burger that my sister and I shared was delicious but the reason why I am giving it 3 stars is because of the service; it could've been better. When my dad ordered, he had ordered the Jack Daniels BBQ ribs. However, what came was just regular ribs, lightly coated in sauce... We noticed the difference between my mom's Jack Daniels ribs and his and asked the waitress why his was different. She said it was because his meal did not come with the Jack Daniels option. She could've told him that when he ordered; that definitely could've altered his decision. His meal also came with two sides but the french fries did not come out. He reminded her to bring the fries twice because she had forgotten to get them again.. Lastly, my sister noticed some small plastic pieces in her water. She initially shrugged it off because she thought it was ice but when she couldn't chew it down, she spit it out. I told our waiter, and she her response was, ""Ew, what is that?!""... I have no clue what that was! We paid with gift cards that my mom had which was also a confusing process.  In short - it's a good place in the area for gatherings if you're craving American food, but service could be better",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=20,2.52,2.57,2.372,2.1879999999999997,2.55

Service was extremely slow for no freaking reason! When we were finally greeted we ordered: Appetizer: Potstickers. They were black on one side and undercooked on the other side.   Entree: He had a slider and some wings. No issues. I ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp. It comes on a hot plate and should come out ""sizzling"" hence the name. Supposed to have chicken breast, 2 kinds of melted cheese, sautéed peppers and onions, and Cajun shrimp. I substituted the Cajun shrimp for fried jack Daniels shrimp. 2 sides. This BULLSHIT hit the table and I thought I was being PUNKED!!!! The chicken came out lukewarm. The fucking cheese was still cold (I.e. I could see a square slice of American cheese just slapped on top of the damn chicken). The white shredded cheese was still in shreds and cold. Shrimp cold. I ordered a side of mixed veggies, it looked like they were all raw!!! It was embarrassing!!! And not to mention they gave me the wrong damn shrimp.  The cold part is, is we waited nearly 30 mins for that crap. The guy who brought our food (not our server) didn't seem to give a rats ass about how my food looked, and simply said ""uh, do you want me to take it back for you?"" I wanted to scream. He should've never brought it out like that! It should have never left the kitchen this way.  Told him it was ok, could he just grab our server. He rolls his eyes a little and says ok. WELL IT TAKES DAMN NEAT 10 MORE MINS FOR THE SERVER TO COME OVER. HE SAYS THE GUY NEVER TOLD HIM THAT THERE WAS AN ISSUE. So I proceed to tell the server, he half listens to what I was saying and says he'll have them re-do it with a half assed sentiment. He didn't give a f--k either. I said nah I'm good. I don't want anything else. He walks off.  I ask another person for the manager. The manager finally comes, and PLOPS HIS ASS DOWN IN OUR BOOTH LAUGHING AND SMILING LIKE WE WERE ALL ABOIT TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE DINNER TOGETHER. JUST A COMPLETE JOKE and unprofessional. I told him my issue...........drumroll please.......... he didn't give a shit either!! We ended up leaving without eating anything. Our dinner was ruined and we had a movie to get to.

Finally I tried to flag someone down by saying excuse me but they were walking the other direction (they had to hear me because they were only 1 table across from us and it was not that busy) I decided to get up and ask the host by the front door for a menu. They said ""Oh sure here is a couple of menu's"" It was around 7:30pm and finally a waitress walked by and we were ready to order food.  She never asked us if we wanted anything to drink (which most restaurants do) We ordered 2 appetizers and dinner 1 coke & 1 Margarita. My appetizer came around 7:45 pm close to 8:00 pm then came my dinner not to long after and my wife's dinner. My wife asked the waitress what happen to her appetizer? She said ""Oh you did not get it"" My wife said no. So she went back to the kitchen asking about the appetizer she ordered. 8:15 pm comes now 8:30 pm. Finally we got the appetizer to go at 8:30 pm and she refills my soda with diet coke instead of regular... SMH... We got up from the table walked over to towards the door and left because our night was ruined and we had plans after diner but it got to late. When we got home I decided to call the manager on duty his name is ""MATT""  I simply explained what happen and he told me. Why did you leave and not come/talk to me first?  Now I am thinking well it's my wife's birthday and I do not want to make it any worse by arguing even though the evening is already ruined. I told said What would you have done if I did come to you before we left? He said "" we would have given you a free appetizer. I laughed and said  The appetizer was 1/2 off special already. My Appetizer is normally $10.00 and I paid $5.00 so you are going to give me my appetizer for free saving $5.00 Wow how generous! The bill was $52.00 and my wife even tipped the waitress. I said how about cut the bill in half and we will call it even. He said I can't do that.  I called the 1-800 number and spoke to someone and they offered a $10.00 gift card for the bad service. I said you are offering us a $10.00 gift card for lousy service that took 3 hours to be seated and be waited on are you serious? I said there was several people coming in after us and being waited on before us. They even got their food before we did. Here is what should have happen that night. 1) 15 mins to be seated (not 30 mins) 2) Host should walk the guest to a clean table (NOT DIRTY) and hand both of us menus. Then in less than 5 to 10 mins  3) Waitress/Waiter should then ask the normal everyday question ""Can i start you off with something to drink""    4) Waitress/Waiter should then come back in 2 to 5 mins to take our order 5) Appetizers should be on the table before the main meal 6) The meal comes 10 to 15 mins later after the appetizer 7)  Waitress/Waiter normally asked if you need any refills or how is the food, is everything okay? 8)  Waitress/Waiter usually ask if you need a to go box if you have food left over. 9)  Waitress/Waiter then bring you the check/bill for check out 10) Guest usually leaves a small tip if the service was good Going to a restaurant should not take no more than 1 hour to be seated waited on and eat food. (depending if it's really really crowded)  Not 3 hours! 6 pm to 8:45pm ? Hometown Buffet is 100x better than this TGI Fridays!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=80,2.28,2.42,2.356,2.02,2.364

Mom's coupon was about to expire so we drove on over to the neighborhood Friday's for an early dinner at 5pm Saturday night. Staff welcome was on point! All of the wait staff had easygoing smiles and two of them were stationed at each door up front to cheerfully greet everyone entering. Now that's how to engage with customers. No wait to get seated but hosts did have a bit of a mix up on where to seat us since it wasn't busy yet. Tables and drink/dessert menus could have been wiped down a bit more, but not a big deal. The fam got steak & lobster tail and steak & salmon plates while I got a Caesar salad with 4oz steak. Lobster is either steamed or grilled. Kevin suggested grilled for more flavor, but it sticks to the shell. Still good though! Jasmine rice pilaf is tasty and has the right texture here! Great accompaniment to meat or fish for the rice fanatics. My only issue is not receiving my Caesar dressing on the side, despite the confirmation. I didn't bother saying anything cuz I didn't want to waste food. Soft pretzels with cheese & bacon dip are always good here! Perfect size for 4. Shrimp cocktail tasted like the typical frozen kind. Drinks all around! I swear, after my sis turned 21 I'm pretty sure we're becoming an alcoholic fam haha! JK. Tried the Mandrin Mule-- tasted like soda with a hint of orange! I really liked this. Sis got a sweet Mixed Berry Mojito, good as well. Mom got a Prosecco bottle and Dad a glass of red wine. Might try the blended Frose next time. The Zoosk pay machine had a broken receipt slot issue but we still paid using it after redeeming our coupon personally. All in all, great place to have drinks and a comforting meal. Happy hour sounds like a good deal to unwind any day of the week! They're open until 1am weekdays and 2am weekends. Sunday has HH prices all day, and also stretches to the dining room, unlike the other days where it's just at the bar area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city,2.48,2.41,2.38,2.32,2.438

I am giving them 2 stars only because of the waiter without him this place would've gotten 1 only because zero isn't an option. Let's start with the appetizers, we ordered onion rings and mozzarella sticks. The onion rings were hard as rocks and way over cooked, the mozzarella sticks were cold (like how the hell do you serve cold mozzarella sticks). So I said I wasn't gonna complain but when they placed my sizzling chicken and shrimp on the table I was too done. I damn near exploded. I order this meal every single time I go to Friday's and it was not what I ordered.

I wanted to ask him if he ever tried rice on the side when he eats a burger. It sparked in my mind that the reason why he offered it was because I am Asian. I decided to go for lemon butter broccoli.
