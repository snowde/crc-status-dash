31,Brittany B.,"Panorama City, CA",135,74,3.0,4.0,2012-02-06,"i don't think this place deserves 2 stars.. Its a chain restaurant in a malll... you get what you get, haha... It's convenient, has a variety of food, and its open super late (which I can't say for many places in the SCV)..  I think what made my last experience so great was our amazing server in the bar on Friday night (2/3/2012)... I unfortunately do not remember her name but she is slender, maybe Hispanic, and has long straight black hair.. maybe try to find her?  She was very nice, funny, and attentive.. she even managed to keep track of our different bills at our large table.. I am a huge fan of great customer service and truly believe that it can make or break an establishment.. In this case, it really did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valencia-2?start=40,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997
99,Jackie J.,"Castaic, CA",74,135,41.0,2.0,2012-02-09,"When TGIFridays first came out, I loved them. All of them. But it seems they have gone downhill since they came onto the scene and this particular Fridays is hit and miss as to whether the food is cooked corrrectly or overdone. They have an extensive drink menu and they have varied choices of food which is nice when you just can't make up your mind what you want. However, I always go there with trepidation, wondering if the food will actually TASTE good once I get it. I'd choose other places over this one which is a shame because Fridays used to be great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valencia-2?start=80,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.44,2.12

We were blown away by the friendly, attentive staff.The food was standard Friday's- Ii's predictable but reliable and for some reason, you can't help but demolish your plate.

37,Luna W.,"Reseda, CA",13,102,,3.0,2012-09-17,"This was the first time I ever went to a TGI Friday's and I will say that the experience was alright. We had a family reservation for about twenty of us for a family member's 60th birthday. The seating arrangement was alright and the staff were very friendly (too friendly for my taste, almost talking to us like we were children...). Though I'd rather have an overly friendly staff than a bunch of jerks. The restaurant itself is very family oriented and has a decent atmosphere, we were close to the restrooms which I found convenient for such a large party.  I have wanted to try TGIF for awhile now, mostly because of its 2 for $20 deal. What I found very interesting was the fact that they DID NOT give you that menu. You have to specifically ask for it, otherwise you will not see it on the regular menu (at least not at this restaurant).  The 2 for $20 menu is quite limited, however this is expected. I believe you have about 6 entrees to choose from. In this deal you get: 1) Share a Shrimp Cocktail or Order any appetizer at same or lesser value (which would be $9.99, you can choose from almost all the appetizers).  2) Two Entrees (which has a choice of about six or seven entrees I think). 3) Share a Dessert Remember to look at SHARE - this means only one, which is fine to be honest. I had a hot chocolate (can't go wrong with a hot chocolate if you hate coffee). The mug is very large and you have lots of whip cream to go with it, yums. My mother and I skipped out on the Shrimp Cocktail and instead got the Fried Mozzarella which was quite delicious. For an entree I had the Petite Sirloin with french fries (yeah i suck at picking sides). I recommend you get some kind of vegetable in there for this meal. I ordered the sirloin medium well and it came out tough anyway. It was delicious at first but then toughened as I continued to eat it. The fries are yummy though.  My mother had the Pork Chops which was deliciously juicy and very much recommended.  For the dessert we shared the Brownie Obsession - that was heaven! That is a delicious dessert, big enough for two, maybe even three. The brownie was super hot, but that just meant it was fresh! It comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and pecan nuts.  Overall I was mostly disappointed with my sirloin... I usually don't get meat/steak at restaurants but I didn't want to get the usual chicken strips (which i regret now).  HOWEVER - I don't mind coming back to try the chicken strips and the pork chops and taste another delicious dessert. I personally would only recommend if you're just going out for no real reason and you're hungry, not for a date or party.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valencia-2?start=40,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.348,2.48

I liked the BBQ burger I got, but my girlfriend's pasta left a lot to be desired. The service here was pretty lame. Our server asked us a few minutes after we were seated if we were ready to order. We said we weren't, and asked for a couple minutes. We ended up waiting 20 minutes for him to come back, despite several attempts to get his attention. Later, when he brought the check to us, he knocked over a glass of water and soaked everything on the table.

I had the cobb salad and it was fine.  The chicken was moist, the produce was fresh.  My partner had a flat iron steak that she ordered medium well and it came medium rare.  She ate around the rare parts and didn't complain.  We had the loaded chips for an appetizer and those were tasty.  A nice change from nachos.  I tasted the spinach dip too and that was good.  The food was ok, its a chain, what do you want?  I can always find something at a chain that will be acceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valencia-2,2.68,2.68,2.68,1.8960000000000001,2.68

The steak fries tasted more like cold chunks of potato with a crusty substance which was supposed to be parmesan (it tasted nothing of the sort) scantly sprinkled about.

After the waitress took out drink ordere it was like she feel into a black hole as she took a good 15min until she reappeared to take our order.          We ordered chips and salsa thinking that would be quick to bring out (we were starving). Ya we were wrong it too cause we didn't see her for another 15min. Then when we finally got it the chips were hard & burnt.        Then another 15-20min go by and we get our food.  I ordered the Cajun shrimp & chicken pasta. Pretty much it was a bowl of noodles & grease with about four shrimp. The chicken look so suspect I didn't even teast it.        Yaaaaa won't be going back to like ever !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valencia-2?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.052,2.44

The place was half empty and we wanted to sit somewhere little quiet, there were couple tables empty and nobody sitting next to it but we were told they do not serve there so we had to sit in between two families with little kids running around and screaming. But we were so hungry and tired we just wanted to have nice meal. I ordered steak, shrimps with broccoli and fries, my husband got Jack Daniels ribs with fries. Service wasn't great , it took the guy 10 min to bring ur drinks ( he was serving only two other tables) Food came out and only thing that was good was steak thats one star there otherwise if I could I wouldn't give none. My shrimps were salty, brocolli disgusting and fries felt like it was cooked yesterday. My husbands ribs horrible, he used to love it because that Jack Daniels sauce but thats it, it was dry, just a little of meat between bones and fries were not good either. Normaly I would return it and walk out of there but because we were really hungry and tired we eat it. So the food is D- and service the guy brought us drinks and then he stopped by with the check, we had to stop him three times to get more soda, more napkins and check. And the price for this ""beautiful night"" $55 without tip. Horrible food, bad service and its dark, old and really dirty ( whipe the floors at least once a day).

My husband ordered the French dip and it is a very tiny sandwich. It tasted like it had canned onions on it. My husband eats just just about everything but he was very unhappy with his food.

Looking through my remaining birthday emails, I realized it had been some time since I'd been to this TGI Fridays. Certainly long before my yelp days. So, I asked if we could have dinner here. Plus, I had a free birthday desert email.      We parked up on the top level of the parking structure, and then walked down to the restaurant. Turns out on Thursdays they've actually got a farmers market happening here within the shopping plaza. We poked around the vendors selling their jewelries, and their fruits and vegetables. While wandering around, I bought her a bouquet of flowers, we tried some local salsa, and then we finally meandered into TGI Fridays.       The place was fairly empty, and we were quickly greeted and seated in the bar area by the hostess. The table between us was fairly tiny, and when the waitress brought the free chips and salsa because I'm a member of that stripes club, I had to move them up to the top of the wall between us and the booth on the other side.  The waitress who worked with us was extremely helpful, knowledgeable and quick. She was really good at her job and quite honestly made the whole night better.       After perusing the menu and accidentally playing footsie with schoolteacher beneath the tiny tiny table, I went with the Cajun Shrimp & chicken Pasta. Schoolteacher went with the far healthier Chipotle Yucatan Chicken Salad. We chatted about our days and the discovery of the farmers market while waiting for our foods to come out, which wasn't too long afterwards.       The food was presented well, and delivered hot. My Cajun pasta was tasty, and Schoolteacher's salad was also good.  After eating the massive pasta meal, I was pretty stuffed, and asked helpful waitress lady which desert kept best. She suggested a few, and from among those I chose the Red Velvet cake with ice cream.  Helpful waitress lady even had the cake separately packed from the ice cream, as to not cause soggy Red Velvet Cake. She also had the chips and salsa packed up, being careful to pour the salsa into sealed containers so they didn't spill on the chips and soggy them up either.  I really did like helpful waitress lady. She was super helpful and really on the ball.      As we wrapped up dinner and exited, I thanked waitress lady and hostess girl on our way out of the place. I also thanked Schoolteacher for picking up the bill.  It was a pretty good night all around. Thanks everybody!

1,Dale S.,"CANYON CNTRY, CA",40,195,113.0,1.0,2015-06-08,"When you go in based on Internet web page listed specials.   And order what's there.   1.  Mojito (house) 1. Long Island ice tea (house) Special says 3$ each and your bill is 16+.  Damn.  There's a reason this place is dead.   Even during a Clipper playoff game it's dead.   So take head all those that listen to my reviews.   Stay away.   For a great happy hour, hit up Salt Creek.   As for the picture.   I enjoy the ring up for the Ultimate L.I.I.T.    Side note.    Dig the manager consistently checking the computer for updated sales.  Bad move.   Just reeks of desperation.   And yes, I know what I speak of. This place is a waste-of-time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valencia-2,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
7,Teresa M.,"Honolulu, HI",11,42,1.0,1.0,2015-06-08,"Poor, slow service! Restaurant wasn't busy, but it took them 10 minutes to seat us, another 15 minutes for a server to ask us what we wanted to drink, and 30 minutes to bring us our drinks because they had to brew more tea Then, after ordering appetizers, it took them forever to bring it out. To make matters worse, it took forever for our main courses to be served. Mind you, we arrived at the restaurant at 5:30pm and left at 8:40pm.  To add to this review, the restaurant was dark, dingy, and dirty. They didn't clean the floors after a huge party had left and the restaurant was empty. Does anyone work here? It also smelled pretty funky",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valencia-2,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88

My son said his chicken quesadillas were the best he has tasted. We shared the crispy green bean fries and they were wonderful! I also ordered the grilled sliders. I was worried that 3 small burgers would not be enough, but I could not even eat the 3rd one. They were larger than I expected and absolutely delicious! To top it off, the waitress was very attentive to our needs! I wish we lived closer but we will be back very soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valencia-2?start=20,2.92,2.54,2.54,,2.692

The serving staff was great!! And the drinks I got were strong, which is a complete A++ in my book. Also the happy hour here is pretty bomb, it's like $4.50 for a 17 oz Guiness!

48,Elle W.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1,19,,2.0,2015-10-01,The food is terrible. Nothing tastes fresh and everything is bland. It is only good for late night drinks. The best thing to accompany a light night drink is some bar food and it's unfortunate that it's so bad. The service is better if you are sitting inside versus outside. The only thing this place has going for it is that it has great late night hours.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valencia-2?start=20,2.88,2.58,2.58,,2.7

This was already a pretty gross restaurant to begin with but they have given up all hope.
