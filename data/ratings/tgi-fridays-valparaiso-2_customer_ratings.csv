5,Jeff S.,"Aurora, OH",33,1,,2.0,2012-08-13,The service was terrible and the food cold with small portions.  We stopped here while staying in Valpo on the way to Chicago.  Fridays are usually decent but this one was really poor.  Our server had an attitude with us and with her fellow staff.  I hated to send food back because it was cold and did so any ways.  It came back still cold.  Sta away from here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valparaiso-2?start=20,,,,,
4,David C.,"Portage, IN",25,27,,1.0,2012-10-13,"First off, when we were seated, we were alerted to the new menu items and treated as new customers to the chain, we weren't.  No biggie though.  What pissed me off, was that our server denied a 2 for 10 special was going on (there were commercials on at the time for the deal, and was the whole reason we went.) So they were off to a bad start, my girlfriend and I ordered what we usually do, a salad and boneless wings to start, jack burgers for an entree.  The salad was fine (not a shocker), but there was a boneless wing that was unrecognizable and cooked just enough to not be deadly.  We left that wing for the chef.  Also, TGIF's wings have considerably gone down in quality over the past year, not food quality, just poor cooking of said wings. Before we were even halfway done with our appetizers, some girl, who was not our waitress, delivered our burgers and made a quirky remark as to how fast the chef was.  I just wanted to yell at her, but didn't, should have, but then there would be spit on our burgers.  TO ALL WHO WORK IN A RESTAURANT! THERE IS NO FRIGGIN GUEST ALIVE THAT WANTS ALL THEIR FOOD AT ONCE! IF THEY DID, THEY WOULD ASK FOR IT! So the bad start at this point was becoming a bad meal and was kinda infuriating.  My only solace at this point was the fact that clearly the burgers had been cheapened up to sell on the two for ten menu, so I thought they would be cheap.  WRONG! Each burger was ten dollars each!  which used to be a thing I didn't mind. The burgers were not 1/2 lb patties like they used to be.  Instead I got a cheap (school lunch lookin) 1/4 lb patty.  They switched the bun to a cheaper bun. Burnt my bacon, undercooked my ladies bacon (HOW!?). And put the sauce on the bottom bun, so the bun was literally mush by the time it got to our table (which apparently wasn't long). I ended up paying the almost 50 dollar bill, and am never going back there again. Mark my words, if I do decide to try again, I will be VERY VOCAL about shitty service and food even if there is a full table of kids right next to me(which by the way, empty restaurant +young couple +family time at the next table = super f***** annoying).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valparaiso-2?start=20,,,,,
2,Russell T.,"Valparaiso, IN",2,8,5.0,1.0,2013-03-24,This T.G.I is horrible. First watch what you order. I ordered Cajun shrimp dinner and when the bartender took my order she asked what I would like with that soup or salad without telling me that was extra cost. You also can get a Ale Sam Adams or any other ale in a tall glass way cheaper any place else like Semento's charges 4.25. Oh and Head over to Applebee's if you want a great variety of food that frankly taste better then here and way better prices. You are not in Chicago and even if you were you would not be worth that price. T.G.I. Fridays where they steal your money for subpar food. They sure have gone to crap over the years.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valparaiso-2?start=20,,,,,
1,Andy K.,"Westville, IN",0,3,,1.0,2014-07-28,"Service was very poor. 20 minutes before server came out to take the order. Almost 40 minutes to get our food. All 6 of our dinners were lukewarm to cool.  4 tables that sat down 10 to 20 minutes after us received their food before us and 1 table ate and left as we received our order. We complained to the server, she told us she would get the manager and never seen her again. Manager was very attentive, offered to have all food to be remade.  We decided to not take our chances as they had their chance. Ended up at a Chinese buffet. Pretty pathetic. We will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valparaiso-2?start=20,,,,,
26,Angela S.,"Valparaiso, IN",0,16,,2.0,2015-03-27,The service is poor. The establishment isn't as clean as it should be and could be. Food is just OK. Nothing to write home about.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valparaiso-2,,,,,
23,Madi L.,"Valparaiso, IN",1,12,2.0,1.0,2015-10-17,"Tonight we decided to come here. BAD IDEA!  So first of all I ordered the California Club sandwich, the bread was chewy, there was barely any lettuce on it, it was just gross. Then someone got a kids chicken sandwich, and the chicken was so chewy and burnt she didn't even eat it. Then another family member got a burger with barely any lettuce again! and said it was burnt and she ordered sweet potato fries and said there was so much salt and pepper on them she didn't eat them either.(and they cost an additional $1 then regular fries) Lastly for the  entrees there was also a chicken sandwich ordered and he said the sandwich was burnt and chewy again. The drinks and meals didn't come together either. THIS WAS A GROSS MEAL!!! Lastly I ordered a refill for Dr. Pepper, and found a DEAD BUG in it I would definitely never come here again unless it was for the free wifi. Defiantly would recommend Red Robin instead of here! In the end we didn't get charged for the Dr. Pepper or the kids meal. But yet the meal still cost $50!! that meal was NOT a $50 quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valparaiso-2,,,,,
24,Rodney L.,"Valparaiso, IN",14,26,1.0,1.0,2015-10-31,If I could give them a zero I would.   Heavily salted and processed food.  My tongue hurt from all the salt.

22,Parry P.,"Merrillville, IN",2,4,,1.0,2016-05-23,"We had bartender with a crappy attitude that was upset when I asked for a different drink because I didn't like my margarita (it literally tasted like watered down tequila snow cone). When I asked for food, she didn't even place my food order until 45 mins of me waiting. Now typically if it's busy I wouldn't care but it was at 10pm on a Monday. It was pretty dead. The bartender barely came by so I had to ask a waitress about it and she told me the kitchen was now ""working on it."" (Heads up, I ordered the $5 potato skins app which is 4 pieces so there's no way that should've taken that long) We had to ask for the manager for our check. Overall, we were here for a few hours and the bartender only came to see us s few times. If I could give this location 0 stars I would. But I can't.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valparaiso-2,,,,,
25,Guy C.,"Valparaiso, IN",0,7,,1.0,2016-07-21,"I was there at 4 pm, all the wait staff and the manager was busy talking about pokemon. I got my and my son's order and being the only ones in there you would think they could get the 2 orders right... But NOPE, wrong on both. The the waitress argued with me saying I got what I ordered. Never again will I return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valparaiso-2,,,,,
13,Roxxy K.,"Valparaiso, IN",0,14,2.0,5.0,2016-08-26,"Right now they are doing the $10 endless appetizers with endless choices last time I was here,  I didn't care for the mozzarella sticks. They were a disappointment. They tasted grainy and just terrible. Now I am the type to judge a place by their mozzarella sticks so I didn't return until my husband saw the commercial for endless apps and really wanted to go. Since it had been a few years we decided to swing by.  The mozzarella sticks have vastly improved they were ooey gooey delicious sticks of cheese heaven. They were crispy on the outside and the cheese was perfectly melted. Hands down best mozzarella sticks I have had in forever. They didnt taste overly greasy either which is a problem other restaurant have.  The ghost pepper wings were deliciously spicy,  the Buffalo wings were good too. Normally I don't care much for buffalo sauce,  because of the heavy vinegar flavor. But these had a great balance.   Hubby loved the green bean fries and wings as well. The potato skins were amazing. My brother likes to buy the boxed variety from the store. Fresh is so much better.  Food aside our waitress was an absolute delight. Very super awesome and I believe the manager came by our table too? I could be mistaken but he is also a great guy too!  Overall we had a very pleasant experience and may return sometime in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valparaiso-2,,,,,

21,William G.,"Valparaiso, IN",0,9,4.0,1.0,2017-03-26,"I've been here numerous times and I've never gotten a good meal here. Sometimes I've been limited to certain restaurants because I'm eating with somebody who is a vegan/vegetarian and apparently other TGI Fridays have some menu options that will work. Other times it was late and this was one of the few restaurants that wasn't about to close. But you can always count on this place to serve some stale, cold french fries and an entree that has been sitting under a heater too long. Other times I've found myself here because a group of people have eaten at other stores in this chain and assumed uniformity of product and service would ensure the same quality food. It did not. The best thing I can say about this restaurant is that there is a Chili's restaurant across the street that is pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valparaiso-2,,,,,
10,Nicholas M.,"Chicago, IL",146,250,6.0,3.0,2017-04-15,"What am I doing in Valparaiso? Not sure exactly but I was hungry and desperately needed some grub to continue on with the day. First thing I'll point out is the service. I thought it was fantastic here. I hate that I forgot the name of the waitress who served us but she did an excellent job in keeping us feeling welcomed.  The food however, was so-so. The appetizers were definitely not worth the  $10, pot stickers were fairly small, potato skins weren't that tasty and the mozzarella sticks lacked flavor. My chicken sandwich was not the best neither, pretty underwhelming. I truly appreciate great service in the hospitality industry, and what we were given today was more than acceptable by the waitress who waited our table. Very helpful and kind hearted with a great sense of humor, someone who didn't treat us like just some other faceless customers. That's real service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valparaiso-2,,,,,
14,Scott B.,"Valparaiso, IN",0,16,,1.0,2017-04-19,"I've been coming here since it opened, years!  Always had great service, great food, first name basis with the bar staff.  Our last visit was one for the history books.  Walked in and the bar table wasn't cleaned off from last guest.  Hostess didn't offer to clean it, waiters walked by-didn't clean it, bar staff were oblivious to us standing by the table, not sitting.  Finally a bartender decided to do the job.  Ordered our food, fish, not thoroughly cooked; no dressing on the tomato/mozzarella salad.  The kitchen manager came over and spoke with us.  He apologized to us, blamed it on under-staffing and inexperience of kitchen staff.  The manager arranged for gift cards for our inconvenience.  By far the most disappointing visit to a venue which has been one of our favorites.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valparaiso-2,,,,,
9,Nicole B.,"Chicago, IL",1872,599,2539.0,4.0,2017-04-22,"We've had steak and chicken both here & they are okay. Nothing to write home about. But I give them extra stars as they have a nice variety of appetizers and they are all delicious. The fried green beans, zucchini, & pot stickers are my personal favorites. Plus they let you break them up into smaller portions for half the price allowing you to try more at a time. That's just awesome! Then they have the well stocked bar too. So we are happy going here to fill up on appetizers & drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valparaiso-2,,,,,
18,Tim S.,"Lima, OH",34,2,,2.0,2017-05-07,"This was our first time here, we are out of town and visiting friends. We stopped here due to the commercials for 10.00 unlimited apps. We ordered the chicken flatbread and the loaded skins. The chicken flatbread toppings were cold and the skins barely had anything in them. Our next round was bbq wings and meatballs, again all was cold. Our hostess was great, but our server was very slow and took forever, never checked if we needed anything, took 10 minutes before he ordered our drinks. We probably will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valparaiso-2,,,,,

19,David C.,"Valparaiso, IN",0,11,2.0,1.0,2017-07-18,"Wow. I travel a lot. And if There is not a great local restaurant or if I am tired, I can always depend on TGIF. Not here. I'm done. Lived in Valpo for 20 years and TGIF was always a good go to for a drink, sports bar or light dinner. But last three times:  new wait staff; new MGR's; no atmosphere  because no one is there; and last night the salad was not fresh and I and my wife have no idea what they served as FRENCH ONION SOUP... no cheese, lots of croutons and more a consommé than soup. We returned and got the same thing. As a matter my wife thought the cheese was coddled. Our  associate had quesadilla and I THINK there was some cheese and chicken in the quesadilla....key word..""I think"". One positive. Jason, our wait was great. But it's our last time at TGIF's. I hate writing a review like this but the restaurant needs to know. They need to fix it. Or they want be here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valparaiso-2,,,,,
8,Aimee S.,"Valparaiso, IN",0,4,,2.0,2017-08-11,"Very poor experience here and the only reason i gave it two stars is because my husband's meal wasn't horrible. We sat down and ordered water/soda, then he came back for our dinner/appetizer/drink orders. Then the waiting began... We waited for about 20 minutes for our apps, only to have them delivered by a different server, and pretty ice cold... But I can overlook that, you know possibly an oversight... I ordered the black bean burger; HOWEVER we proceeded to wait another fifteen minutes after our apps for our main meal... I ate a fry right after it was delivered and found that it, too, was ice cold... Then i looked at my sandwich to find it sauce-less... Dry as a bone. So i waited for the waiter to come back with our napkins we requested, which took an additional five minutes... Then he dropped them on the table without a word, so i had to call him back over. I told him that our app was cold, but I'd chalked it up to a fluke, but then my sandwich didn't have sauce and my fries were cold. His response, ""so what do you want new fries or something?"" I was less than impressed, and by the time the sauce came in a container that looked like they had dripped all over it on purpose, my food was cold. Even the burger. And I wasn't about to ask for new food, I mean, come on, I've seen, ""Waiting..."" But then the check came with no comp for our less than pleasurable dining experience....  But my husband's chicken and cheese was warm like it was supposed to be. My drink (MaiTai) was probably the best part of my meal, but no way am i ordering two when the service was so deplorable. And I don't solely blame the waiter, but as I sit here typing this, two other tables have had incorrect orders come out as well. And I guess my complaint includes the fact that the food went through both the cook and the waiter to get to me improperly made and cold... Not to mention that we didn't get silverware when we came in, so when I dropped a bit of salsa on my blouse, I had to mop it up with my beverage napkin, because our waiter hadn't come to check on us and we didn't have the silverware to get a larger napkin from... In conclusion, when i have other restaurants such as Industrial Revolution, Applebee's, or Chili's to frequent, i won't be coming back here again for a long time (IF EVER).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valparaiso-2,,,,,
16,Nathan F.,"Great Falls, MT",0,3,,2.0,2017-08-30,"Apps were cold.  Burger bun was hard as a dry sponge.  Told staff, guessing they didn't say anything cuz the couple beside me ordered a sandwich which they sent back for the same reason.  Would expect better from a well established chain restaurant.  Should be noted there was maybe 10 customers at the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valparaiso-2,,,,,

Everytime, including today, I come in I have to have my food either reheated or recooked because of rawness, coolness, or it's charcoaled, and no I'm not just talking steak. The service sometimes is good, but usually unless you get lucky, you get rude service that's incredibly slow. I do not recommend coming here.

My burger was dropped when the manger was bringing it out. No biggie, mistakes happen. He even took care of the entire bill but I sat and waited for a good 45 minutes for the re-done burger and I wasn't too hungry after eating an appetizer and soup.

7,Spencer R.,"Valparaiso, IN",0,6,1.0,5.0,2018-01-08,"This was our second time eating at fridays, atleast in the past 5 years. So we had a horrible experience last week at this restaurant. So bad that we sent 3 of the 4 meals we ordered back. After we sent them back, I summoned the manager explained the horrible service. From waiting 30 minutes to be seated in an empty restaurant,to the server messing up the order,to our food coming out cold. I told him I was only paying for my drinks and I was leaving, that I did not even want the food when it was finally brought out. Joshua the manager apologized a handful of times,asked if I wanted to stay and eat it, I said no because I was leaving. He  insisted we took the food home because it was done, obviously free of charge. I said ""whatever""i was still pissed. He came back with a $50 certificate, told me to please give them another chance, if not valpo ,Hobart. Well after a long day at work and the wife with the kids we went to the valpo store already stressed out. Zach our server was awesome. I handed him the business card and he said oh yeah that doesn't even matter your taken care of now. We showed him we had a coupon for a free appetizer, he said save it. Zach was amazing, he had completely redeemed your store. The managers were good too.
