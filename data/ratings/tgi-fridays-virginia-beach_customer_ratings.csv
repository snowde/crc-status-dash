35,Lauren N.,"Virginia Beach, VA",34,114,2.0,2.0,2012-11-30,"I don't know why I'm writing a review for Fridays. Its pretty much the same as every american food chain restaurant as far as food quality & experience. BUT this one in particular i feel like sharing my experience. I like that they have a rewards program. So i decided to use my points towards a coupon for a free entree. The coupon had so many exclusions it was ridiculous , but i  read the fine print & everything and found a meal compatible. Our waiter was excellent, and didnt seem bothered we were using a coupon but said he'd have to get a manager to redeem the coupon. This Asian Manager Lady came over & said that my meal was excluded from the list & i told her i read everything on the coupon , all the fine print & this meal was most certainly not excluded. I started to get the coupon out and show her  , but she stopped me and said ""whatever. if you THINK it is...ill just do it.""  and went off. completely rude, i couldnt believe she was a manager. Anyways, we didnt hold this against the waiter and tipped him good. But i decided Id never go to this location again. Previous experiences were not so bad, but not good either. Food tastes like its prepackaged/ frozen.  Some people have told me it actually is frozen food. So I dont go to these places anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-virginia-beach?start=40,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002
64,Stephanie W.,"Virginia Beach, VA",137,294,262.0,3.0,2012-12-04,"We came on a Friday night around 6:30 pm. It wasn't busy and we were seated immediately. At first they tried to seat us at this small two-person table (which, okay, I get it...it was just two of us, but still...) near a large group celebrating a birthday. We asked to move and they had no problem accommodating our request. Our waiter was friendly and efficient. They gave us free chips and salsa, but this might be standard now for all TGIFriday's. Either way, it was nice to have something to munch on. Our food was cooked perfectly and service was fast. I ordered the Jack Daniels burger and man was it delicious! Of course anything with Jack Daniels sauce is going to be amazing (in my opinion). It comes with bacon and cheese and normal burger toppings (lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo). My boyfriend ordered the sampler with mozzarella sticks, boneless wings, and fried green beans. I know they have been on the menu forever, but I had never tried fried green beans before and they weren't bad. I miss their fried mac-n-cheese though.

I didn't know that happy hour is at the bar only and our hostess never mentioned it to us.  I was really disappointed I was missing out on the half priced appetizers.

66,KaSonya Y.,"Norfolk, VA",0,7,2.0,2.0,2013-01-18,I craved TGIFriday's brownie obsession while on my lunch break. I placed the order to go.  Once I returned back to my place of employment I opened the container to find the brownie frozen solid!  I contacted the manager who insisted that the brownies ordered to go are not heated so that it does not melt the ice cream.  This explanation may have been acceptable if the brownie and the ice cream were packaged in the same container.  The manager went on to apologize for the waitress not informing me that the brownie would not be served warm.  He also offered to mail me a free appetizer/dessert coupon.   Nice gesture for a craving gone wrong.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-virginia-beach?start=60,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216

24,Jon B.,"Richmond, VA",185,220,192.0,1.0,2014-01-05,"Two weekends ago, my family and I visited Virginia Beach for some R & R. During our stay at the beach, we went to this TGI Fridays location. TGI Fridays is known for serving good food and being a cut above other sports bars such as Applebees. How was my experience? Here goes the review.  The Good.  Convenience- Anyone who is from or has traveled near Lynnhaven Mall knows that it is a magnet for traffic. Doesnt matter what time of the day you travel in the area, if the mall isnt packed then the nearby restaurants are packed. Well this Fridays was not packed during the time of my evening visit. My family was able to walk inside with no wait time.  The Bad: Service- The host and server did not appear to be very friendly towards my party. We were treated with basic respect, but there was no hospitality shown from the two employees. Aside from that, the wait time for the food exceeded thirty minutes. There was a party that sat down beside my table about 15-20 minutes after we arrived but received their entrees about 5 minutes after we did. When we finally received our food, it was pretty luke warm. Because we were hungry and did not want to wait another 30+ minutes for a changed order or battle through the traffic to go to another restaurant where the wait would have been even longer, we did not ask for a refund.  Overall- Service, service, service. That is what will make or break my experience at a resturant. The service was seriously lacking and was inexcusable. There is no reason why the food should have taken so long to come out. I could understand if the restaurant was filled to capacity, but it was barely 25% filled during my visit. For that reason, I do not have any plans to come back to this particular TGI Fridays. ONE STAR.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-virginia-beach?start=40,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212

5,Stephanie H.,"Suffolk, VA",67,209,23.0,3.0,2014-05-23,"I like Friday's. Out of all of the locations in the Tidewater area, I like this one the best and after that the one in Oyster Point. To be a chain restaurant, I do enjoy the food. My favorites are the triple jack combo and the sizzling chicken/sizzling chicken and shrimp. Love their loaded mashed potatoes. I enjoy their ribs - keep in mind that this is not a dedicated RIB restaurant - but the ribs are pretty good. Let me be the first to tell you that anything that is drenched in Jack Daniels BBQ Sauce is freaking AMAZING. For those who like to indulge from time to time in spirits, they have an extensive drink menu which I love (don't judge me)  The only complaint that I have with this location is that they are SLOWWWWWWWWWWW. I don't care what you order, where you sit, who your waiter/waitress is, what time of day it is, what season - the service is soooooooo slow. Even going there upon opening at 11AM and less than 10 customers they are so slow. Only come here when you have ample time.

Specific Visit:    Yesterday I stopped in with my 2 teen sons and 5 of their friends, total 8 people dining.  The new ""Endless Appetizers"" option is awesome, as 5 of the 8 kids got 5 different appetizers as their choice, then shared, so all folks worked on those endless eats. :-)    Total bill was about 108.00 for 8 peoples' eats and drinks, what is that, about $12 a person?  A good deal for this fun outing.    --- And I tell you what, the waiter was so good and friendly with this table full of teens that I did what I only do once or twice per year:   left him a $100.00 bill cash tip.  Wait service was 5-star on this occasion!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-virginia-beach?start=20,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412

My broccoli cheese soup was thick.  Like, thicker than cheese dip thick.  My guess is they either didn't mix it proportionately with liquid or else it had been sitting for awhile and condensed itself.  It was salty but edible.  It came with one pack of stale saltine crackers that lacked any kind of crispiness.  My friend fared much better with her steak; she said her meal was very good and she would order it again. Service was adequate.  Our drinks were refilled as needed and the check brought in a timely manner.  I debated about giving a 3-star review, but my soup was honestly two-star.  So steer clear of the soup and maybe it will be okay.  I just know now I'm really even more excited to eat at local restaurants!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-virginia-beach?start=40,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003

58,Urs M.,"Jacksonville, NC",282,234,1579.0,3.0,2015-08-19,"I did it again, but this time it wasn't so bad. Mom and I went to TGIF for some post-shopping nourishment. Trying on clothes and shoes really gives you an appetite. I think our waitress's name was Courtney... I can't remember, but she was nice. She was always checking on us and refilling drinks. She was even seating people. They sure kept her busy! We got the Three-For-All app. You get a choice of either boneless or traditional wings and two other apps. This one had mozzarella sticks, pretzels with beer cheese, pot stickers, potato skins, fried green beans, and something else... We decided on ghost pepper traditional wings, pot stickers, and potato skins. Mom wasn't too thrilled with the app. She said the potato skins were too greasy, the wings too spicy, and she wouldn't even look at the pot stickers. I thought the potato skins were okay and the wings weren't spicy enough. The pot stickers were another story. You can definitely tell they were previously frozen. The wrapper had a dry, yet damp, texture and the filling was really chewy. I ate it, of course. The flavours were all there. For our main meal, mom ordered the shrimp and ribs and I got the 6 oz. sirloin with tomato mozzarella salad and spinach. Mom picked off all the breading on her shrimp because it was too greasy, but she ate everything. She really enjoyed the ribs. My steak was good (I ordered it medium and got it rare - sent to back and it was perfect) and so was the salad, but the spinach was suuuuuuper salty. I got halfway through and called it quits. I could feel my feet swelling up. lol Dessert was the Tennessee whiskey cake. I loved it and I usually don't care for dessert. The whiskey sauce was good and the cake had a good consistency. Even my mother, who's a picky eater, had a few bites. Our bill came to $68. My mom still doesn't believe her meal was $25, but it was. We left with full, happy bellies.

As I worked myself through the endless app menu (wow that sounded like such a large behind thing to say) I was greeted by Kevin who was working server bartender (he was helping the bartender) let me give him kudos.

She worked her butt off, she will sleep well tonight. Kristin joked, worked and never let her smile slip. There was one more bartender who I don't know his name. He's a handsome without a smile. The one thing I noticed from him was he took a credit card from a patron and put it on his pocket?! Maybe TGIF finds that okay but it looked suspicious. I say that bc Kristin kept the cash and cc out in the open. I almost forgot Adam. I noticed him in his reddish shirt and he appeared ""important"". I never called him over yet he came to talk to Me which I thought was great. He mentioned the items i ordered, he asked how my experience has been and we had a very professional chat.

That's why this place gets 2 stars. That was the only good part about our visit. They had a special for $14.99 and it was a ""sirloin and lobster tail."" We asked about the special and the waitress didn't know what it was-- but it was 5:50 and the deal ended at 6:00. She had to go get someone else to explain the special to us. The meat was a ribeye. Not a sirloin. Which would have been fine if it wasn't so fatty that I couldn't even cut through it. I was able to salvage about 2 bites from the entire steak. She also told us it came with 2 lobster tails and 2 sides. The ""lobster tails"" were actually one small lobster tail cut in half that wasn't even cooked all the way. (And she also forgot to mention that even though it came with 2 sides there would be an up-charge for them both.) I told her about the quality of my steak, and she told me she would tell the kitchen. I ordered the Oreo cookie ice cream dessert-- which was great; until I found a piece of a plastic bag in the middle of my ice cream. She apologized and took the dessert off of my check, but she never had a manager stop by the table, and still charged me for the steak that I only had 2 bites of (since the meat wasn't even edible.) Also- when we got our check, the special was charged as $19.99 instead of $14.99 and she tried telling us it was because of the up-charge for the sides. $5 for 2 sides that supposedly came with the entree didn't seem right. She then admitted to hitting the wrong specials button charging us more and fixed our checks. We were in the restaurant for about 2 1/2 hours because the service was ridiculously  slow.

41,Drew P.,"Virginia Beach, VA",130,356,663.0,3.0,2017-09-28,"This TGI Friday's is located on Lynnhaven Parkway, not too far from Lynnhaven Mall.  The exterior of the place is easy to find when you drive by.  It will be on the right if heading north on Lynnhaven Pkwy to get to the place.  Their parking lot is small in the front and is in desperate need of a re-paving.  Also, the parking spots there are pretty thin.  I saw pickup trucks and bigger vehicles parked there that took up two parking spaces. What brought me in here?  I actually got a coupon to use in the mail.  Since it had been a little over three years since I visited the place, I figured it was a good time to try it out again.  The coupon was for a buy one get one entree with two drink purchases.  The coupon was good during the month of July.  I am bummed though that they reset the stripes points, as I had racked up 479 points after my last visit before this one.  I'd come back more often if I can get those points re-added to my account so that I can use them. Once you come inside, the bar is pretty much in front of you, along with other dining areas.  One thing you'll notice as soon as you come in is how dark the place is.  I don't like it too dark, so the request was to sit at a table near a window and that request was granted. Once seated, it took a few minutes for our server to come to the table.  It wasn't too busy in there at the time, but she had some tables all over the place, not just in one area.  I think they would be better off doing it in sections instead.  Anyways, once she came to the table, she was very attentive and answered all of the questions we had for her about the menu, substitutions, and food allergies.  No appetizers were ordered on this visit. For my choice of entree, I selected the Jack Daniels Chicken Sandwich.  I asked to have the Jack Daniels sauce on the side so that I could do some portion control, which they did for me.  Overall, the sandwich was good and was fresh.  I would say that it is similar to other chain burger/bar type places that are out there.  The fries were good as well, but it seems like you don't get as much here when it comes to that.  It looks bigger in the way that it is displayed.  Also, I ended up dusting off some of the salt on it as I try to do things lightly salted (a photo of the entree is included). Once everything was done, it was time for the check.  The coupon was applied to the purchase.  I gave my server a bit of a surprise, as I had already paid the check before she came back.  How did that happen?  There is bar code at the bottom of the receipt, and you can pay directly through the Friday's mobile app.  She didn't even know that was an option and we were the first customers of hers to use it.  I showed her how I did it and she liked that. Overall, I did have a good experience here.  It wouldn't necessarily be my first place for burgers, as I like to try many different places, including locally owned non-chain places.  Service was great with no issues.  The food was good.  There wasn't anything that would ""wow"" me to give a rating above 3 stars.  Cheers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-virginia-beach,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6

I got the spinach queso and chips. The queso tasted expired, the chips were completely stale and impossible to chew, and the guacamole was dark brown even though all I could taste was lime. My boyfriend got 10 wings and they only gave him 9. Please just don't go",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-virginia-beach,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
45,Jackie L.,"Virginia Beach, VA",14,206,45.0,1.0,2017-11-20,"So we came here with a party of 7 to celebrate my fathers birthday at 5pm. we walked and told them how many we had and the hostess said it would be a 45-1 hour long wait?!!....Looked around and it was empty and plenty of 4 top tables that could pushed together to accompany us and when we mentioned this they said they couldn't do that because they didn't offer to do that for the larger party that was waiting ahead. Wait? So because you lack the critical thinking aspects of basic problem solving, we couldn't get a table in an almost empty restaurant.. No thanks. We left to go elsewhere. Will not be returing",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-virginia-beach,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6

The sauce is kinda sweet but i use  Tabasco and it tase really good. The Onion Soup was a little salty but goody. It wasn't bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-virginia-beach,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
43,Christina C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",209,215,88.0,2.0,2018-01-02,"this place seems to be falling off. i used to come here a lot back in the day to get a jack daniel's burger, some fried green beans, and some happy hour -- but their service has gone off and the drinks suck! the food was okay, but the service is so horrible that you end up getting your food cold cause it's been sitting there.  we rarely ever see a hostess by the door cause they're playing around with a server in the back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-virginia-beach,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
