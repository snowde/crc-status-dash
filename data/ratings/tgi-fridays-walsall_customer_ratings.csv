0,Ling Y.,"Walsall, United Kingdom",97,173,1742,4.0,2016-03-12,"I've been to a couple TGI Fridays before, in Aberdeen and Sheffield and I didn't enjoy it that much, but now Walsall has the restaurant so I wanted to try it out. The other weekend we went in about 5pm and could not get a table unless we wanted to wait 1.45 hours so we left. Next day I phoned up to book a table for a week's time, to be told all bookings were filled but some tables are free for walk ins, but there may still be a long wait. So we planned it, to arrive on opening at 12pm (we actually arrived at 11.30am n had a walk round the shops lol).  We got our table and used a birthday offer email for smoothies and ordered a main each. I had the jack Daniels chilli hot dog and my boyfriend had the chicken strips. The chicken was nice, I really liked the sauce. My hot dog was best one I have tried, compared to Marco Pierre White etc the bun was soft and fresh. Only thing was it was all served in a trough like container so it was hard to slice the hot dog up and very messy to pick up and eat. But I managed it.  You do have to pay for parking outside TGI but the restaurant is good. I would come again.. I played the match n win game on their app and won a bottomless Coke drink which expires in October so it's worth downloading the app.  Download the TGI Fridays UK App, use my code LingYi78, scan barcode on your receipt and you'll get a free appetiser!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-walsall,,,,,
1,Kim Y.,"Walsall, United Kingdom",18,22,300,1.0,2016-05-02,"Where do start? Second visit here after it opened a couple of months ago. Well the first visit was plagued with long waits and not being able to get hold of our server. Was hoping for a better experience. Well it's a wet and windy bank holiday Monday. First of all we drive round the pay & display car park to no avail so we had to park over the road. After trying to decide where to eat we chose TGIs we were informed there would be a 30 to 40 minute wait. We went and sat at the bar to have a drink to wait. About half an hour later our buzzer went off and we were shown to our table. This was a high booth right outside the toilet door by the pass. Not a problem unless you are vertically challenged like me. I felt like Alice in Wonderland because my feet were swinging and came no where near the rail for your feet. We had already been looking at the menu while at the bar. It took 10 minutes for our server to come over to take our order. A Let's Play Ball hot dog with no pickle or ketchup and a crispy duck fajita with a Coke Zero no ice. My partner had his drink of Coke Zero he had at the bar. Another 10 minutes wait for the coke which came with ice, I reminded our server that I had asked for no ice. She took it away and returned with a drink sans ice. We watch food pile up on the pass before it went out some on there for more than 10 minutes. About 25 minutes after we ordered our food came out. My tortillas came out then I had to wait for my duck. Our food had not say for long.  Mine was ok just really really messy. Not first date food. My partner didn't like the topping on his hot dog the bit in to one of the fries. He pulled a face and went yuck. I knew they were seasoned. He can't have salt due to medical reasons and hasn't for about 9 months. I then tried one and they were disgustingly salty. I called our server over. Explaining that no where on the menu does it say the fries are seasoned just crispy. That we normally would ask for no seasonal on if stated on the menu. She tried to offer us more fries but my partner didn't want them. I asked to speak to the manager. A manager, Nigel came over. I explained again and he tried to offer us more fries but my partner refused. I just said they were over seasoned and it should be stated.  We were asked a couple more times by a couple of people if everything was OK. We replied yes so we didn't have to explain again. My partner ate half of his hot dog and none of the fries. I ate most of my fajitas. We then waited for our server to clear our table and get the bill. I nipped to the toilet to wash my hands because they were sticky from my fajitas.  I returned and no one came. About 10 minutes had passed. Some then dropped something in the kitchen and a shard of ceramic about the size of a thumb nail came frying over the pass and hit my partner on his arm.  I shouted 'that just hit him on the arm' and a manager was summoned. We then started discuss what happened again. He then said he would sort something out and went off to get our bill. After I explained we had been waiting for the bill and table to be cleared for 10 minutes.  I said the service and experience had not been good and half off the food had not been enough. After my partners arm had started bleeding. He then wanted it to go in the accident book. He then just came out with a folded piece of paper the said we didn't have to pay anything. We told him we would not return.  They even took food off the pass that could have had shards of ceramic in from the drop. If you want the TGI experience avoid Walsall and go to Hagley Road or Sutton Coldfield much better all round. Just to add I have been home for two hours and the food is still repeating on me. I think it is the greasiness of the duck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-walsall,,,,,
