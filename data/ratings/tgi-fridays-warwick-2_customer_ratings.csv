30,Sha'Ri R.,"Wilmington, DE",76,92,37.0,2.0,2012-09-09,I dont go to a lot of chain places but I normally enjoy Friday's. This place the food is NOT consistent and I have been 6-7 times. The night manager is very nice and fixed my meal when it was wrong. Actually I prefer to go at night. Lunch time seems to be when I have a problem. I have experienced cold food under cooked chicken wrong food being charged for food did not recieve. Do not get to go food outside of the 6-7 times I made that mistake twice food was soggy and yuck,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=60,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44
40,Rebecca R.,"Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico",87,161,11.0,2.0,2012-09-24,"I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants.  There is nothing very unique or special about them and I am always looking for what makes a restaurant stand out. My girlfriend wanted to meet here for dinner, so I agreed since who doesn't love a night out with friends? I have to say I'd rate the place 5 stars if it was on service alone.  Our waitress was an absolute doll and checked on us frequently, enough to where it wasn't overbearing, but enough to keep our drinks full and our table clean. The food was nothing to write home about.  We ordered a nacho chip appetizer.  The chips were lackluster and we didn't even end up finishing them.  They had some melted cheese on them and were served in a small bowl.  Honestly for 9.99 i could have popped my own chips with cheese in a microwave and called it a day. I ordered some chicken and shrimp dish with mashed potatoes for dinner.  Again, nothing special here.  The chicken tasted a little funky and there was so much garlic I swear I had heartburn... great service, not so great food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=40,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.4080000000000004
53,CatznDogs Z.,"Warwick, RI",0,17,1.0,1.0,2012-10-15,"On Friday, 10/12, I spent $20 on the worst meals I have ever been served.  I ordered 2 burgers for takeout, and arrived 5 minutes ahead of the 20 min. window I was given on the phone.  When I got home (@ 3 miles) the food was absolutely stone cold.  The french fries were cold and dry (double-fries) and both burgers were overdone and cold.  The medium burger was gray and dry, and the medium-well burger was a crisp, black puck that we couldn't cut with a knife.  The garnishes were dry and curly, and the lettuce on my burger had a big slimy rotten spot on it.  Both meals went right into the trash. BTW, when I went in, there was no line to be seated, the place was 1/3 full, and there was no reason for them to be rushed.   DISGUSTING.  They deserve to go out of business - that was shamefully bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=40,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002

47,Kristi L.,"Concord, CA",60,227,13.0,2.0,2012-12-29,"Sometimes I wonder if there should be a different rating scale for chain restaurants a la Ruby Tuesday's, Applebee's, Chili's etc. - you just can't compare them using the same 5 point scale to other local places. That said, I'll try. If not for a $25 gift card received at Christmas, I likely would have NEVER gone to Friday's - I really prefer local holes-in-the-wall over any kind of chain. However, $25 is $25 so we went.  My husband and I showed up at 7:00 pm on a Friday night, so we were fully expecting a wait. You can imagine our concern when we walked in and were seated immediately. This was a little TOO easy. Our waitress came by after our party was complete, asking if we wanted beverages. We all ordered drinks and put in for an appetizer of the Tuscan Spinach Dip (which from what I could tell is basically the same spinach and artichoke dip you'd find anywhere). About 1/2 way through the appetizer we asked for napkins as it appeared we didn't have those nor silverware on the table. The waitress didn't check in again until we were wrapping up the appetizer, and I had to remind her about the napkins we had been waiting on. We never actually got the napkins until the appetizer was gone. We did get silverware moments before our meals came, which were okay - no real complaints, but I certainly wasn't wowed by anything I ate. I was, however, anxious to try the Salted Caramel Cake for dessert. Unfortunately, our waitress wasn't to be seen for quite some time (I lied, I saw her flirting in the kitchen with some guy she had no chance with...sorry honey). Anyway, she was passing by our table in a mad dash nearly 20 minutes after we had finished eating, and my husband literally had to stop her in her tracks to ask for the check. We couldn't fathom paying with a card knowing how long everything else took that evening, so we put down some cash and were ready to leave.  The waitress popped right over when she saw green on the table, of course.

As if that wasn't bad enough my husband found an expiration day sticker in his steak!! The 'use by' date was 2 days before. The manager's explanation was ridiculous and did not make sense.

When we first arrived their was no hostess at the door and there were 3 groups waiting to be sat. The restaurant was pretty empty as it was a Sunday night at 7pm. We were finally sat at our table, and then waited about five minutes for our waitress to show up. Then after placing our drink order it took another 10 minutes for them to arrive and for her to take our appetiser and entree order. When our appetisers arrived, at different times we didn't have silverware. So we grabbed silverware off another table near us and caught the attention of the manager who said, you guys were day without silverware? Yes we were...to which he said seriously? And walked away.

This location is in a large plaza parking lot and parking was easy on this particular Thursday night even though the place looked fairly busy. My mother and I were greeted at the door and shown to a booth right away by a friendly hostess. Drinks orders were taken soon after while we were left to peruse the menus. I got water with lemon. The water quality wasn't great so it needed that lemon. It might be worth noting that they brought my lemon on a plate and later when my mom ordered a glass her lemon already came floating so not consistent in this way if it maters to you. We decide to split this fancy club sandwich that has bacon and avocodo on it ($10ish) and do do a tasting trio ($15) of thai pork tacos, mac & cheese bites, and chicken hibatchi skewers. Our waitress was really considerate in actually bringing the sandwich and fries out portioned on two plates. The fries looked a little barren when split between two but the sandwich was definitely large enough to satisfy along with the apps. I really enjoyed the skewers and mac & cheese bites (oh god the mac and cheese bites were so good) but my mom really liked the thai pork tacos so I was able to negotiate for extra mac & cheese bites to my benefit.

I love the Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta for an entree and the pot stickers and spinach dip are my favorite apps. They also have weeknight specials...$3 mojitos on a Wednesday...you can't beat that! Late night Wednesday bartenders are great. Very friendly. They always check on me to make sure I'm satisfied and they remember me so they also know what I'm likely to order and when I wanna try something different, they give me suggestions. Haven't had a bad one yet. Coupled with the deals it's a good experience and nice to take in a game at the same time. Not too expensive plus I have their membership so I get coupons and informed about specials. It FREE to join! There aren't many people at the times I go...it's late then so it's expected.

The cheese sticks are one of my favorite items on the menu and they were fresh and delicious as usual. However the entrees were a bit disappointing. The Philly Stacked Burger wasn't cooked to order and appeared to be sitting for awhile as the bun was very soggy still not horrible. The 6oz sirloin was cooked very well. I got the side tomato mozzarella salad and all it came with was a piece of fresh mozzarella and a few cherry tomatoes. The portion size was incredibly small compared to what you get with other sides.  I also asked for an add on of a lobster tail and the waitress taking my order stated they didn't have it but then added they can top it with lobster. I was confused but still took her up on her offer and was disappointed again. For the extra money to only get a few tiny pieces of lobster was a joke but they'll keep me coming back if only for their cheese sticks.

42,Richard L.,"North Attleborough, MA",0,258,,3.0,2015-02-09,"This review is based partly on nostalgia. As an previous yelp post stated this building  is of the earliest TGI Fridays's built which make it worth a visit if only to check out the layout.  Back in the early eighties many TGI Fridays were located in historic buildings in large downtowns while a few found home in specially designed square buildings in the out lying suburbs . These early suburban buildings were often three open floors with multi-level dining. This Warwick location was the latter and was built in a field far away from the yet fully developed rt.  2. In fact , the surrounding shopping center was added years later and  originally this TGI Friday could only be accessed  from rt 117. I believe this Friday's was also one of the first national restaurant chains to come in Warwick if not all of RI.  History aside this location's  food i and service is up to par with the the other Fridays. Some things have changed . Sunday brunch is no longer offered but the coffee has really improved greatly through the years, as in they must have switched brands. To me the variety  and quality of of desserts ( think frozen or prepackaged) were never great (see menu). I found on my last visit the refillable drink soup, salad, bread stick , lunch is no longer offered which was a disappointment. At the times of my many visits  the dining area and restroom were clean and the staff were fine.  Unfortunately, in my opinion  Friday's  in general, have seem to lost their luster and uniqueness  with their rapid expansion in multiple locations. .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=40,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005

I ordered the pb and J wings and I have to say I have mixed feelings. The peanut sauce was good but the hanbanero jelly was lacking in quantity.

Whatever she came over with her blonde hair completely down, really greasy, and gross. She was running her fingers through her hair while chewing gum talking to us. We ordered our drinks and before we could say we wanted to place our appetizer she ran away. 5 minutes went by. 10 minutes went by. 15 minutes to get our drinks!!! My drink was some sort of flavored tea and boy was it nasty. I asked for another one with less syrup. Another 10 minutes. They had an appetizer deal that you could pay $12 to have unlimited apps, my friend and I thought it over and decided against it and ordered a single order of mac and cheese fried balls. We saw Meghan walk by us with several orders of the appetizer we ordered but none of them made it to our table. We didn't get our appetizer until after the food that another server brought out. She never once checked in on us to see how everything came out (after waiting another 1/2 hour.) Our food was amazing, I can at least say that. We had to flag down another server to get to go boxes and to ask for our check. After another lump sum of time we received our check, did I mention she basically spit all over my friend and I? We looked it over and there was a $12 appetizer charge with four refills (meaning that four more orders of the Mac and cheese balls were ordered on our check.) We barely received one of them. Every time we saw her walking by us with the appetizers she was eating them! WHAT!!! And then to have the nerve to try to make us pay for them!!

Now, small, pre-frozen chunks of, what tasted like cardboard, were served.I realize these aps are intended to be loss leaders, but management...wake TFU! not good! You need to make these aps so good, people want to come back. We had these tonight and decided not to order the Jack Daniels burger and salmon. I will say in spite of the appetizers, the bartenders, Dee and Steph and the Manager,Jeff all was good. They listened, empathized and understood where we were coming from.

Had to get a second one after 3 sips. Commented that there was too much ice and got another cup with 95% ice. His Pasta with butter and cheese was served as plain pasta with a small side cup of clarified butter and shavings of Parmesan. It had clearly been under the heat lamp for a while as the Parmesan was melted to itself and the plates and bowls were too hot to touch. On a positive note, my wife's salad was plentiful and tasty.

They were especially hot, I had to wait a little before I could eat.  Josh was quick to get our refills and came to make sure things were good. There was also a point during our meal when one of the waitresses dropped a plate and we all heard a very audible ""What the Fuck"". I was not expecting that type of language when there was clearly three tables with children around. The only other downside was the cleanliness of this place.

His response ""those idiots!"" No I'm sorry.  Another waiter brought over the right order after waiting even longer. The bartender never came over to check on our food or asked if we wanted refills on our beverages.  He had no problem conversing  with everyone at the bar or even the high top next to us. Finally after moving the scraps left on our plates enough, the bartender asked is what we wanted for our second round of endless apps.  Confused we mentioned that the first waitress already took that order.  He went to his POS and then came back with his favorite phrase ""those idiots"" and asked us what we had ordered cause apparently the kitchen staff had messed up again. And yet again we waited a long time to the point that we had lost our appetite. At that point another waiter came over with our second round. Upon seeing that we had no more room for a single plate this waiter decided to clear our dirty plates (something the bartender could have easily done when asking what we would like for a second round).  After picking a little bit we decided that we wanted to leave.  We waited even longer till I just went up to the bartender and asked for our checks.

Dumbfounded she has no idea who I am and if I ever wrote my name down, she couldn't find her sheet of where she put my mind. After finally finding it she states she crossed me off. NOW I'm livid and after going back and forth for a little bit she tries to rectify the situation and immediately Sears my party and I. Once seated the waitress Emily sits us and I order all waters and an apply juice and ask to speak the manager. After a short wait Deb the manager came over and apologized for the wait and offered a free appetizer. Emily took out order and came back with drinks. We waited an additional 20 minutes for our appetizer and maybe another 15 minutes later our food arrived. I ordered the buffalo wingman's burger well done.. when the burger arrived, I took one bite and saw this burger came out rare. Emily was notified and she offered to bring it back and rush them to make it.. WELL NO, it took another 20 minutes and at this point I didn't even want it. Once the burger arrived again it was overly done, to the point it was just burned! I didn't want to make another scene so I just took the burger but I am SO upset at the service tonight and I could noticeably see other patrons felt the same. Staff was dropping plates and spilling drinks, one staff member was even kicked a trash can and yelled out of anger in the kitchen out anger when he shouldn't have done that in an area patrons can visibly see him! Refrain from going here on a Saturday evening, this evening was just hell",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2,1.8,1.8,1.8,,1.8000000000000003
55,Alexandra M.,"Bonham, TX",0,19,1.0,1.0,2017-11-25,"Go to another location if you must eat at Friday's. This location is nowhere near great. The employees are always unaware of what is on the menu & will argue against you if you try to correct them. The food is either undercooked or over cooked, there's never really an in between.  Also if you try to talk to the manager, they blow you off. Definitely not a classy restaurant at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2,1.64,1.64,1.64,,1.6400000000000001
66,Joel B.,"West Warwick, RI",0,8,,1.0,2017-11-29,"Wednesday 330 so place wasn't busy. No one at front door, waited awhile for someone to appear.  Decided on a cheeseburger and chicken sandwich; pretty easy order. The restaurant had an odd smell inside. I'm not sure if the floors were washed with a dirty mop or the bar wasn't clean. Food was not great. My burger had dried up onion slices from being old and lettuce was wilted. My wife's sandwich actually had pieces of lettuce that were black and decaying from age. We had the manager come over. She didn't seem concerned about the food and asked if we would like a free dessert. We weren't interested in free dessert just edible food that wasn't rotting from sitting around.  I've had better burgers from Wendy's.  The waitress seemed more concerned about our food being disgusting than the so called manager.  Never again will I go back. Wished I had read reviews before coming here. How are they still in business?  Why hasn't board of health shut them down?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003
