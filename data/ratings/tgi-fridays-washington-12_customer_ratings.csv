Usually when I find myself at TGIF, it's not b/c I purposefully want to go there but bc I've exhausted my usual options in the Foggy Bottom area.  The other night, that was the exact situation I found myself in. The menus in general remind me a bit of the ones at Silver Diner, Apple Bee's, etc. But unlike Silver Diner, which offers breakfast options at all times of the day, and lower calorie options, TGIF doesn't. They have a few scattered ""lower calorie good price"" (or some variation) options but really not too many.  I got the Korean tacos, which come wrapped in corn tortillas.  It looks like the tacos were grilled or something b/c the veggies/lettuce in the tortillas were also brown.  They tasted okay but weren't hugely filling.  Frankly, I wasn't sure what exactly made these tacos ""Korean"" except that they came with sriracha sauce. Our waiter was friendly but he didn't seem to know the menu too well, specifically the drinks menu.  He had no clue what the Long Island Iced Tea cost but to be fair, at least he readily owned up to not knowing it, asked, and came back quickly with an answer.   All in all though, TGIF will likely remain a place I go to only when I've tired of the other options in Foggy Bottom.  It rings average time and time again and there's no specific reason to return promptly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12?start=120,2.04,2.04,2.04,2.1879999999999997,2.04

We sat there for a good 10 minutes before a young man came by, introduced himself as our waiter and said he would be right with us. No prob. The guy must be really busy! Only two minutes later I saw him standing near the beverage dispenser chatting it up with 4 waitresses. I watched him for a few minutes and discovered that all 5 employees were busy socializing. Niiiiice. We got up and walked out. Nobody cared except for the fact that then the waiter complained to the host he had another table to clean up.

We all enjoyed our food at a reasonable price and had a very funny server. On another Saturday at dinner time, our party of 4 enjoyed a lovely feast of appetizers, cocktails, and dinners, all prepared to perfection. The food isn't gourmet, but it's good, high-calorie cuisine. For the drinks, we ordered off the 7 day a week happy hour menu and I got a rum and pineapple cocktail. He poured it on the other side of the bar so I didn't watch how much of what went in to it, but it was the single strongest drink I've ever had. I told him that that was way too strong, but when he didn't offer to make another one immediately, I just asked him to bring me a half glass of pineapple juice and I'd pour it and mix it myself. I made quite a soggy mess of the bartop and napkins there, and really wish he'd just made a better drink to begin with.

And yeah, it's often a mostly black crowd at the bar and if you can't deal, then you're a racist and you can go live on another planet, bye. This place is really more of a ""local hang-out"" than what I would normally consider a franchise restaurant. If you go there frequently, you learn which bartenders are going to dump half a bottle of vodka in your drink and which ones are going to skimp. (Hint: if you're not at the bar, they'll skimp.) I go because my co-workers know everybody here and even though I am a pretty hardcore introvert, I love hanging out, grabbing a drink, and being able to make small talk with strangers (or just sit by myself while my co-workers are hobnobbing with everyone else). I went here for my birthday and it was rather disappointing. We had a table as it was too crowded at the bar, meaning my drinks were skimpy, and my Jack and Coke watered down. A friend with a vertical ID wasn't allowed to buy alcohol, which is silly. (For the record, I have my ABRA license, and it just doesn't make sense for someone underage to spend the cash to get a fake ID that ISN'T horizontal--so you're more likely to be turning down a legitimate vertical ID from someone who can't easily go home and renew their ID after they turn 21, being in college away from home.) I ordered some sort of nacho dish, and the nachos were actually fried potato chips. They were yummy, but it wasn't what I was expecting.

181,Chris P.,"Alexandria, VA",0,5,,1.0,2014-05-11,"I went to GW, I love to go back from time to time. Still live in the area, and I find my myself in Foggy Bottom every now and again. I'm an open-minded person; I'm not from the ""Greatest Generation"", people are people are people to me, AND I still wait tables part-time, so I know what to look for in service.  There's no way to say this but to say it: In ten years in and around DC, this Friday's is the only place I've truly experienced reverse discrimination. Not just tonight, but the last few times I've been in this place. It was clearly upsetting/angering enough that I (who almost never writes Yelp reviews) thought I'd share this. I took a girl out on a date tonight, and since Froggy Bottom is closed Sundays, we stumbled across TGI Friday's on our way to Tonic. Sat down at the bar, and I ran to the bathroom where I found a drunk guy passed out on the floor and helped him up. Ten minutes later I came back, and she still hadn't been helped. FINALLY the bartender came up to us, I got a beer and she a glass of wine. I got the beer instantly (we could see the taps), but it was at least ten more until she got her wine. Ok. You couldn't find a wine key. It happens. We sat there and chatted for awhile, granted drinking slowly, so no need for helicopter attention. She got a second glass, no problem. Then my beer ran out. I kid you not, I made eye contact with the bartender multiple times trying to get her attention. She ignored me. I asked a second bartender for a beer, he said ""No problem"" and walked away. I could SEE the taps from my chair! Meanwhile, my date SLOWLY finishes her glass of wine, and as she took the last sip (15 minutes later) my beer arrives. Ok, maybe the keg kicked. And you had to drive to Pennsylvania to get some fresh Yuengling. It happens. What bothered me was this: As we were sitting there getting TERRIBLE service, staring at empty glasses, everyone else at the bar was getting served left and right, full drinks and living it up. At least four times the bartenders walked past my ten-minute-old empty glass to refill someone's who still had a sip left. Thank God I was on a date and trying to impress this girl, because my blood was boiling, and in her absence I would've made a horrific scene... And you know what the crying shame is? I paid my way through college waiting tables, still do it part-time, and I'm the kind of guy who leaves a $50 tip on a $50 tab. Even with DECENT service! The ""waiter"" in me still wouldn't allow me to tip less than 20%, but these bartenders made a huge (and costly) mistake ignoring us because we weren't of the same ethnicity as everyone else at the bar.  Bottom line: Give everyone good service, because you never know who's gonna leave you a massive tip. And if you don't, you never know who's gonna call you out on Yelp ;) ...To her credit (the bartender's), she comped one of my beers for her ineptitude. I appreciated this somewhat, but I was (and am) seeing red. Band-Aid on a broken leg.  The atmosphere is ""chain"". The service is horrendous. The staff is racist.  Don't go here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12?start=140,2.44,2.44,2.44,1.7320000000000002,2.44

I went in with my Dad for a late dinner (9:30-10ish), so we figured that since we'd pretty much beat the dinner crowd that we'd have no problem getting service.  I'll start out with the positive: they got my order right, even in asking for things like sauce on the side, etc. I ordered the 6 oz. sirloin with the lemon butter on the side, and they did indeed remember. Now, for the things that didn't quite feel right: Another couple, while waiting for their table to be cleaned off, hovered near ours and started having a loud conversation. It was awkward and kind of killed our mood. Their table also wasn't cleared off till we were almost done with our meal, which was inexcusable since the restaurant wasn't even packed at 10 at night. Also, the music was way too loud and our food took way too long to come out. The waiter was pleasant, but didn't come around often enough. I went home that night after eating the sirloin and my stomach didn't quite feel right, either. Overall, while the food was alright when it got there it was not worth waiting for.

Although my freshman year I did see staff just chatting and not taking the job seriously, the two times I came here, both waiters were friendly, knowledgeable and especially accommodating, giving us a wide variety of recommendations and patience at my nagging (I always ask a lot of questions regarding what to pick). The server actually had the courteousness to ask me to check for myself whether my flat iron steak was cooked correctly. Fast and good service, decent food.

51,Mary Grace C.,"Oakton, VA",0,3,,1.0,2015-06-11,"To Whom It May Concern: Last night my friends and I had a lecture last night in Foggy Bottom DC that ended around 8:15 PM. We stopped into TGI Fridays because it was relatively empty and we had heard great things about your establishment. We were a party of 9 and I know that it's a lot for one server to handle but we were her only table and the place wasn't crowded by any means. We ordered our drinks and waited around for them to show up. It took 15 minutes for our waitress to bring out 3 waters, and 30 minutes for her to tell us that the restaurant was out of most of the drinks that we had ordered in the first place.  One of my friends received a coke that was extremely watered down, and it took forever for her to get ahold of someone to fix that. The waitress just kept apologizing, saying that the bar was extremely backed up and that she can only serve drinks as fast as they are made, which is understandable. Two people at my table ended up going to the bar and getting their own drinks, which took them 5 minutes in total so was the bar tender really all that busy? You tell me. Some of us ordered apps and others entrees, and we were informed that the apps would come out before the entrees. I have been a server for the past two years and I know that if the situation arises where food will come out at different times, you send the tickets at different times to ensure that everyone will be eating together. The apps came out THIRTY minutes after they were ordered, and we added four more people to our party. They ordered some drinks and apps and we told them that we would probably be here for a while due to extremely slow service.  Their drinks came with everyone's main meals, except for mine.  This was about FOURTY FIVE minutes into our visit and the only thing I had in front of me was a glass of water. You'd think that a place like TGI Fridays would have people in and out in forty-five minutes, but I was way wrong there. The apps of the latecomers came five minutes later and I decided to ask the waitress if she had just simply forgotten about my meal, and this was her response: ""oh honey, we are just so busy back there in the kitchen tonight. You see, I can only put in a meal ticket and wait for it to come out. Don't worry baby, we'll get it out to you soon."" Okay, hold up. After two different customer service training programs, I have been taught that it is NEVER okay to call your customer's baby or honey, especially when their simple needs have not been met. The waitress could see that I was very upset and without hearing me out, immediately rushed to get the manager. I didn't want to have to deal with the manager if I didn't have to because I know that bringing a manager is the last resort in a situation, according to basic customer service principles. When the manager came over to speak with me, I had hoped to just explain the problem to him because the waitress had cut me off. I started to talk to him and he cut me off just like our waitress had, and immediately said don't worry- your meal is on us. To a normal customer, that might be just what they were looking for, but not for me. Having been in the restaurant business, I know that it is always important to listen to your customers and hear out their problems, which both the waitress and manager failed to do. I would have been more than happy to pay for my meal if I had been given the opportunity to explain why I was upset and try to prevent this problem for next time. Finally, a whole SIXTY minutes later, my food came out. I had originally ordered a half rack of ribs, and a side of mac & cheese. My plate came with fries, not the side I had ordered. The manager came and brought me my side, which was probably the only speedy service any of us had received that night. I had hoped that after one hour that I would be receiving the best rack of ribs that DC had to offer, but I was wrong- yet again. The food was very mediocre and I don't think anyone would ever be willing to pay full price for it.

The Fridays' out in my neighbor are updated and in way better shape than this one, which is shocking to me since GWU is here and the Foggy Bottom community.   My favorite one is in  Greenbelt.

194,Elijah H.,"Washington, DC",0,4,1.0,2.0,2015-06-25,This TGI Fridays has probably the worst customer service I have ever experienced and I'll tell you why.  I knew right off the bat that the service was going to be lousy not long after I walked in. As soon as I came in I expected a host to be waiting there to greet me and no one was there. I then decided I was suppose to seat myself and as I was going to find a booth I saw the host. It was a woman who was crouched down in a booth on her phone texting or doing whatever on her phone leaving the entrance unattended. I was shocked.  Next thing I was seated and ordered my drink and then my entree. As I had finished my entree I decided to order desert. That didn't happened for awhile as the waitress didn't check up on me for at least 10-20mins. Not only that but the place was almost empty and not even that many people were there. Talk about bad customer service!  The only reason I'm giving this place two stars instead of one is because the food I ordered was decent. On another note I definitely won't be going back and I don't recommend this TGI location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12?start=100,1.92,2.08,2.08,1.6720000000000002,2.016

He proceeded to walk us pass groups and groups of people and empty tables and before we knew it we were walking down a dingy hallway, past the dishwashers to a dark back room, with about two other families. Mind you there's only three of us, we passed several empty tables and booths to be seated there..with two other black families in the back room that was beyond dingy and suspect. I had flashbacks to the 1950's and I was born in the 90's. I chose to overlook this until I opened the menu he had just handed us and the pages began to fall out of the booklet. I'm sorry but does TGI Fridays not fund them??? I looked at both of my family members and said ""Let's leave."" As we walked back I noticed several things yet again, empty tables and booths, well dressed people of Caucasian decent sitting in the booths and tables, as well as African Americans to be fair (most likely all at lunch).

My friend ordered a steak and it was tiny and the meat was overcooked and dry. It was not appetizing to look at or eat. + The AC was broken when we went, it was crazy hot in there. The manager was nice and gave us an appetizer because the temperature was pretty unbearable.  + The service could have been better.

Is it the amount of revenue they bring in each week or each month....it must be. Because the service there is crappy. I've been to this location a total of 4 different times for 4 different events. All 4 times the service is unnecessarily slow. Even when the restaurant is not crowded...practically empty & the service is still slow. Yes the staff is polite but politeness will not stop my food from being cold when they bring it to the table. Politeness does not seem to prevent them from making us  wait 5-7 minutes before providing a menu or a glass of water or utensils to eat with. What exactly could be causing the staff of this popular restaurant to move soooo unnecessarily slow? Could this be the result of the staff gossiping amongst each other too much in between the customer service being provided? Or are the cooks continuously falling behind on the grill?

We were sat after a long journey to the back of the restaurant where our hostess gave us contradicting menus - one had obsolete information on many items. Our server visited us after about ten minutes, apologizing in advance for his poor service as it was his first day at this restaurant. This was excusable to us and we actually really enjoyed our interactions with him. He was nice to us and casual in his conversation with us. We ordered two waters and one Angry Orchard - something that should arrive relatively quick. The waters took approximately ten more minutes. The Angry Orchard another ten minutes. He then left before taking our orders, but returned after about five more minutes. We ordered both a 10 oz. Sirloin with Langoustine Lobster topping with a side of Fries & a Salad and a Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Pasta. The food came after about fifteen minutes (which is actually pretty good). Our steak however was completely wrong. We asked for the 10 oz. steak to be split between two of us. The steaks (which were cooked to two completely different temperatures - medium rare and well somehow) were two 3 oz. steaks. We had received the petite sirloin (6 oz.) split into two. The lobster topping was most likely cooked from cheap and frozen lobster meat. The sauce was pretty good. The pasta, however was good.

Worst experience ever.  I wish I could give this place a negative star. We took a trip to DC for my birthday and the first night there we decided to eat somewhere close by. Since I've been to Friday's a million times I thought it was a safe bet since we were familiar with them-boy were we wrong.  We walked in and passed a 2 people outside gossiping really loud. After standing inside the doorway for a few minutes we see them stroll in and realize they were actually the hostess and the waiter. We were so confused as we walked by and they did not even acknowledge us or even pause their conversation to greet us. We ask for a table for 2 and the hostess said Yea.... not sure what the yea meant . few minutes later a waiter walking by asks what we need and we tell him a booth for two and he asks us to follow him. We do and he leads us to a filthy table with the plates still there and he goes "" oh my bad. Stand here I'll be back"". The restaurant is basically empty so why do we have to wait until you clean this table? So after about 5 minutes we sit down. Now it's the day before my birthday and we've been travelling all day so we kinda want to let lose.. but there's no music or anything just the TV on. We ask for drink and app specials and the waiter  said there are none. I have been to multiple Fridays in multiple states and countries- there are always drinks specials. So i decide to look it up on my phone myself and order the drinks I saw.  AS we are ordering drinks and apps I look at the waiter only to realize he is watching the TV over our heads and not even pretending to write our orders down. I stop talking and stare at him and after a few moments he snaps back and say "" oh yea so you want what again?"" Seriously? After we finally get that part of the order in, he tries to take the menu from us. I explain we actually want to order entrees and requests he leaves them. He puts our order in and disappears for a little while. He then drops off everything and as i reach to grab the menu to place the entree order, he basically runs away and I watch him as he goes and sit down, puts up his feet and watch the game. He doesn't check on us or ask if ok-I couldn't believe he was on the clock and just watching TV. We ended up ordering our entrees 20 mins after our apps when the game finally ended.

I sit here now almost an hour and a half after entering this restaurant with no food. It's 10 at night, and our section only has 2 other groups in it. I would never recommend this place to anyone. I know it's not renowned for its food or drink, but they should supplement that with good service.

We had to request a different table. The server told us she'd clean it off - what she actually did was swipe it with napkins because it was still a streaky, greasy mess. Anyhow, I only got one iced tea - there was never a refill brought out and I found a hair in my tomato and mozzarella salad. My server brought out another salad and then made my whole meal free!

54,M W.,"Washington, DC",0,1,,1.0,2016-07-15,"It's unfortunate that I have to write this message, but after our experience, it would be advisable that this restaurant hire new bartenders and maybe management. Simply bad service and questionable staff integrity.  We decided to leave after an hour of torture, we told the manager that we did not desire to wait for our entrees.  Below are a few excerpts from me and my partner's conversation: 1. ""How is it that half of the tables in the restaurant empty but there is a 15 minute wait?"" We were quoted at 15 but it was closer to 25 before we decided to move to the bar. 2.""How can 20 minutes pass without a bartender acknowledging a new guest?""  There were three visible bartenders behind the bar and not one spoke to us over the hour that we sat there. A manager ended up taking our food and drink order. Guest that sat next to us expressed that that was their experience too. 3.""At what point is it okay for a bartender to blatantly ignore a customer?"" We asked a young lady-bartender with braids for two waters, after 15 minutes we noticed that she was still engaging employees and referring to a recipe book. We tried to get her attention several times and she ignored us. 4.""How do you visibly serve guests next to us and not engage us to make sure that we are ok?""  One bartender, she had a pony tail, did just that. Several times over the course of the hour that we were sitting at the bar. She told guest next to us that they didn't have to pay...for whatever reason. 5.""Are staff supposed to be dismissive when voicing concerned over quality?"" The manager/waiter (Daryn?) was very defiant when I voiced concern over the quality of my drink.  It was a Jack Daniels on the rocks, that tasted like it had been mixed with a rail bourbon. He basically told me that there was nothing that he could do about it. He assured that it came out the bottle and did not offer any consolation.  6.""Are non staff members allowed to engage bartenders behind the bar?"" A young lady, who appeared to be dressed in pajamas with a head wrap had an extended discussion with another bartender behind the bar. The bartender was wearing a latex glove and had a shoulder length hair.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12?start=120,1.84,2.01,2.01,1.7000000000000002,1.942

211,Brian B.,"Washington, DC",129,192,190.0,4.0,2016-09-06,"When I heard that TGI Friday's had a special of unlimited appetizers for $10 I immediately called this location to find out if they were participating. Turns out, they were. Now before the dirty laundry Yelp elites trash this place (I can see they've already started), let's establish something first- No reasonable restaurant in their right mind would offer a deal this good. But TGIF had the plumbs to present what I would argue to be one of the boldest appetizer specials in sit-down family food chain history (your move, Applebee's). .  .  . . . After Drew bribed the host with five dollars to put us in a better, less overly air conditioned (and easily forgotten) part of the restaurant, we were attended to by a very spry and fun waitress named Jenay. She hooked us up and just brought us basically every appetizer on the menu so that we didn't have to keep specifying which we wanted next. She kept them coming! She also made us aware of the drink special of the night which was Long Island ice teas for $5. The drinks were stiff! It was also refreshing to see a woman as our waitress considering that, fun fact, TGIF only let men be waiters as late as 1975!!  I'm going to say three words that are going to blow your mind: Sriracha Buffalo Wings. Ever had them ? Didn't think so. They were toppest of knotch. I would have gotten a second order if I didn't feel the need to explore the entire pallet of TGIFs appetizer menu. Some mad scientist through trial and error figured out that combing these two beloved flavors would actually work in unison. The result was pure MDMA. They were the perfect amount of spicy and the chicken was tender. Kevin thought they were too hot but it's obvs that his Irish taste buds were just not prepared for it.  In conclusion, this place is far from perfect. Their potato skins, for instance looked like they were the same frozen TGIF potato skins you get at the grocery store and had just survived a grease-infused stroked while being heated up in the microwave. Their wontons were also less than perfect and had a stale-ish wrapping. They were ultimately not a total disappointment because the pork itself was on point and it's what's on the inside that matters most. But overall, their appetizer menu is strong and that makes for a great restaurant. I hope that TGIF will consider doing more promotions that keep their competitors honest and keep them at the forefront of chain-dining greatness.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12?start=20,1.92,2.06,2.06,1.8400000000000003,2.004

It is hit or miss with the service and by hit or miss i mean decent to great.  I have seen a few people not satisfied with their bar experience but I have realistic expectstions.  Bad: When there's a shift change the new bartender is more comcerned with stocking the bar than attending to the guests (there should be an overlap so the bar can get stocked and customer service isnt sacrificed.) When it's packed the bartender tends to pick favorites, like regulars and friends. When this happens it takes a little more effort on the customer to get the attention of the bartender (bar backs should be allowed to pour water and soft drinks) At certain times of the day the music is too loud. I completely understand that during the school year they cater to young students and young urban locals but lowering the music would not negatively affect the atmosphere. Good: Bartenders are rather nice and know their drinks and like unusual drink requests. They love sports. - Pleasantly Inconsistent: Meals like cajun shrimp and chicken pasta are plesantly inconsistent. Its not always as creamy but it is always good.  The salmon and burgers are always made to order as requested. Drinks aren't always exactly the same but always good and the proces are some of if not the best in town.

Literally, plates of food everywhere.  2. Stood at the front for about 5-7 minutes waiting to be seated. Never saw a host to come and help us (or the other 3 parties waiting). Finally when the host arrived, be walked through the door smelling like cigarettes and joking. Happy he's in a great mood, but he could be more apologetic about the wait. And if he was on break, someone else should've covered the front. (Have experience for years as a server and hostess. So, I get the business.) 3. Phone is ringing nonstop. Host comes back and jokingly asks why we didn't answer. I've been waiting for a while to be seated as I'm hungry, I'm not in the mood to joke about doing someone else's job.  4. Finally sat us at a ridiculously huge table. A table that could sit about 5-6. And we had no menus. And the table was sticky. We moved elsewhere to a clean table. (Not sure why we didn't get a right size of a table initially when they were clearly available.) 5. After moving, we finally got menus. But no word from a server. So, we moved to the bar as some seats became available.  6. Moved to a table that was dirty (as mentioned earlier that everything was messy and not bussed). Asked if we could sit there, female bartender mumbled to another bartender that we couldn't. Something about a low bartending staff. But Drea (yay! Drea!!!!!) volunteered to work our table.  7. We ordered drinks (there was already a happy hour menu on the table). Tried to get margaritas, but a bartender warned us that everyone sends them back because there's something wrong with their margarita mix. 8. There is no sense of urgency with hardly anybody. We're 60 minutes in of being there and there were still dirty dishes sitting around the bar. (They finally cleaned it up after 1.5 hours.) 9. Bartender comes to our booth to explain why she said we couldn't sit at the table. Didn't apologize but just wanted to clear the air.  10. Other bartender (male) has been so into setting of the music, he forgot to pour our drinks. (15 minutes after ordering -- I had been watching the clock.) 11. Got our drinks. Well, I just got mine. The other two in my party didn't get theirs. I got a beer in a can...no glass. (They get their drinks about 5 minutes later.) 12. 35 minutes after sitting, still no food menus. Table still hasn't been cleaned. (At this point we stay because we feel like we're doing a service for Yelpers.) 13. I ask for a menu because I wanted more than happy hour food. They bring ONE menu. None for the other two in my party.  14. Server didn't come back after 15-20 minutes. Female bartender came to take our order. Recommended a meal for one of us in our party. Buuuttttt she couldn't find it in the menu. Apparently, some of the menus are missing pages.  15. After sitting for an hour, still no water. No silverware. My friend had an appetizer.

She said she was new and some drinks we had ordered she was not familiar with. No biggie. We waited between 15 or 20 minutes to get our drinks. She finally brought them and took our orders. It was a party of 6. About 30-40 minutes passed until our entree came out and would you believe it? 5 out of the 6 meals were wrong. Totally off. I understand it was her first day but only getting one meal right? Cmon. We had to wait another 30 minutes for the right orders to come out. 3 of the orders were steak which were asked to be cooked Medium but were cooked Well. The manager took our food back and gave us 20% off the bill. But the biggest disaster of the night was the women's rest room. The counters are smashed and being held up by 2 2x4's. There's a door missing in one of the stalls and all around it looked like this bathroom belonged in an abandoned building somewhere. We ended up paying $91 for that mediocre dining experience which I felt was too much given only 2 people ended up eating there and we didn't have any alcoholic beverages but I didn't fight it because after 2+ hours I was more than ready to get out of there. This, by far, was the worst dining experience I have ever had in any restaurant in my entire life.

1,Farah C.,"Riverdale Park, MD",119,40,19.0,1.0,2017-10-02,"One of the worst experiences I've ever had with any establishment. My fiancé and I were not greeted by anyone for about 5 minutes while we waited at the front with another customer. When the hostess finally came, she told us all to wait to be seated if not interested at sitting at the bar. The restaurant was mostly empty, but it still took 10 minutes for the hostess to come back to seat the 1st customer. I was surprised when the hostess barely came to the door where we were all seated and from about 6 feet from the girl waiting, said ""hey, come on"", and made a hand gesture for the girl to come to her. I was thinking ""wow... no excuse me or anything.""  About 10 more minutes went by as we waited to be seated and two groups came in after us. When the hostess came back, it seemed like she forgot we were there and proceeded to seat the other group of people, until my fiancé stood up from where we were to remind her we were still waiting. The hostess barely acknowledged us and as we approached she said (as if she just remembered us) ""oh, ya'll can go sit up there"" and pointed. I saw my fiancé look at her confused and said ""What? Where?"" She pointed again from the front of the restaurant and said ""that booth right back there"". As we walked back to the booth she pointed out, we both laughed frustratingly, wondering if this was really happening. We sat in the booth and looked at each other, watched waiters walk by, and bartenders making eye contact with us, but no one checked on our table or was even kind enough to smile, say ""hello"" or ""are you being helped"".  After about 5 minutes of looking around, being passed, etc. I began to laugh when I realized we weren't even seated with menus. We'd just been sitting there the whole time. No one had come by. My fiancé walked to the bar and requested the manager. We were informed the manager would come and speak to us. The manager NEVER came. For about 25 minutes, we reminded at least 4 employees that we were waiting to speak to the manager, each apparently going back and delivering the message. We even saw the same hostess point another group of people to the back booth instead of walking them back there. A lady in the group said ""can you show us? I don't know where I'm going"". While we were waiting, we saw 2 employees hugging and making out towards the back of the restaurant (not in the back- like where guests can't see), in plain view of guests. Bartender cleaning the drink prep area and bar, left dirty soap water in a little red bucket right on the bar where we were waiting to talk to the manager.  Finally, after one employee passed us for about the 4th time, my fiancé stopped her and asked her to assist us with getting the manager out. She stopped behind me and I was in the middle of them. As she began talking to him, I became uncomfortable as she was literally talking to the back of my head, like I was not there. So I moved and said ""I'm sorry. I don't like people standing behind me, talking to the back of my head."" (Side note: I really don't. I tell my child this all the time.) She informed us that she was the shift supervisor and asked what the problem was. As we began to explain the problem, the lady who we saw seated about 5 minutes earlier walked up to her asking if they could have menus. We had just prior informed the supervisor that we were not seated with menus. In the most unprofessional way, she yelled from the bar to the front of the restaurant to the hostess, in front of guests, ""why are you seating people without menus?"" Ummm... ma'am that's neither here nor there. You just lost 2 customers and are about to lose another set of customers, now is not the time to discipline your employee.  After asking for the general and district manager's info, we received it. No one ever apologized for our experience or even attempted to offer and make it right. Again, the manager NEVER came out and spoke to us. That's unheard of. This place needs to be shut down. Terrible representation of the TGIFriday's brand. We drove out to the Virginia location right after we left and received much better service than at this DC location. Shameful...
