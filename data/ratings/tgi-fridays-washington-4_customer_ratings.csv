18,Amanda S.,"Clarksburg, WV",6,5,,1.0,2013-09-09,"This was my second experience of TGI Fridays. There's is, honestly, nothing good to say about it. Five of us were on our way to a concert about half an hour away, and we weren't in a hurry. The concert wouldn't be starting for three more hours so we had plenty of time to sit down and enjoy some chow. The service, to begin with, was awful. The hostess, who just asked if we were all twenty-one, sat us in the lounge. The server didn't appear for at least five minutes. It took her another five minutes to get our drinks. Being a server myself, I know what it's like to be busy, but we were the ONLY table in the lounge. We could see her stopping to talk to fellow employees. Secondly, the food itself was terrible. I got a Caesar salad with chicken, and only ate two bites. I couldn't stomach it. Everyone else at the table must have felt the same about their entrees because they didn't eat much more. When we were finished, to try to save time, we had the server put it on one check. That still took her another ten minutes. Needless to say, I seriously doubt we'll dine here ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-4,,,,,
14,Ted S.,"Virginia Beach, VA",498,177,140.0,3.0,2014-01-16,"I feel like the previous reviews of this restaurant do not reflect its quality whatsoever. At the time of this review (01/17/14) there are three 1 star reviews. I've been to a ton of restaurants in my life--this is not a 1 star.  The location is clean and well-managed. Our server was probably one of the most upbeat, cheerful and reliable servers I've had. Even though we had a large party she stayed on top of things and handled our table very well.  All of the food we ordered came out hot and prepared correctly. My friend got a burger that was a bit dry, but that can happen from time to time and definitely wasn't inedible. Everyone else's food was great.  My other friend got the Jack Daniel's sampler platter which had ribs, fried chicken and shrimp that were all prepared with the Jack Daniel's sauce and it smelled so good I almost knocked him unconscious and took it.  This is your standard TGI Friday's I felt like they were consistent with other locations in their chain. It's a chain and I feel like 3 stars is way more realistic of the experience you'll have.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-4,,,,,
13,Shannon S.,"Escondido, CA",503,605,187.0,4.0,2014-02-18,"Review is for the bar area/cocktails only. I don't know WTF any of the previous reviewers have against TGI Fridays. For god sake, there aren't a whole lot of choices in the immediate area for dining.  The restaurant was clean, service was quick, drinks were as described, and tables were bussed in a prompt manner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-4,,,,,
16,Ashton C.,"Uniontown, PA",0,3,,1.0,2014-06-22,"We were so excited to see TGIFridays, we love the food and they are hard to come by. When we were seated there was a gaggle of waitresses standing around talking, okay, no biggie. But after a half hour wait, a family was seated behind us and waited on immediately! Our drink orders hadn't even been taken! We got up to leave and asked to speak to a manager first. Surprise, surprise, the manager was hanging back ""chilling"" with the waitresses. She offered free appetizers, but after that rude encounter and unprofessional behaviour, we would rather just leave!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-4,,,,,
11,Vinny A.,"Export, PA",79,122,52.0,3.0,2015-02-05,"Came here for a lunch meeting and was pleasantly surprised - as I hadn't been to a Fridays in many years.  The service was friendly and attentive and the food was pretty good for lunch fare.  I was surprised by the menu variety - but had no trouble settling into a tasty club sandwich.  It's clean and yes, it's a chain restaurant, but it serves well and can accommodate a variety of dining palettes.  Standard and consistent...this place serves it's purpose...just like a chain restaurant is supposed to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-4,,,,,
9,Chip R.,"West Mifflin, PA",31,199,759.0,3.0,2015-02-22,"I try to avoid chain restaurants opting for the locally owned and run establishments. Maybe it's my imagination but the food at the local places just seem to have more character and inspiration than what you'll find at the chains. But sometimes my opinion gets trumped by the desires of the majority and such was the case last night when I found myself at TGIF.   Okay,  I know,  I could have done alot worse than Friday's...  I mean,  at least it's not Apple Bees. And they did have Troegs Pale Ale on tap,  so the evening wasn't a complete wash.  The service was good, the waitress was pleasant, and it didn't take long to have our orders taken and for the food to arrive.  I ordered the Jack Daniels  Mixed Grill choosing the half rack of ribs and the shrimp with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The ribs were good but there was hardly any meat on them. The shrimps were small and there was nothing remarkable about the mashed potatoes. Sadly the best part of the meal was the broccoli which was crispy and fresh tasting.  I can't say avoid TGIF but with all of the options available, I wouldn't make it my first choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-4,,,,,
10,Tim C.,"Lockport, NY",49,208,1423.0,2.0,2015-04-16,"It's a chain, I was dragged against my will. It had chain food... Do yourself a favor and try a local joint. My server was very pleasant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-4,,,,,
12,Rick B.,"Jacksonville, AL",24,12,5.0,1.0,2015-06-28,Food was very pricey. Had a steak . Over cooked And sauce mostly on the hot plate was burnt to plate and not on the steak. Not coming back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-4,,,,,
15,Anthony H.,"Washington, PA",1,49,8.0,4.0,2015-10-14,"I'm going to level the playing field here based on the fact that TGI's is one of our go-to places to eat and god knows we've spent thousands at this place. NEVER have we had a bad experience or under/overcooked food. Sure it's your typical chain restaurant and it's loud as all hell on the weekends but the food is great. Especially everything off the Jack menu. You can't beat the apps either. I'm talking appetizers and the friday's app, I can't tell you how much free stuff we've gotten from the rewards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-4,,,,,
7,Rick H.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2,6,,1.0,2017-01-21,"Stopped in on a Saturday, was given a wait time yet no names were ever taken.  Seating was completely arbitrary.  Left.  Won't return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-4,,,,,
3,Josh N.,"Cranberry Township, PA",87,217,45.0,4.0,2017-01-22,"I came here tonight (01/22/17) with one of my old college friends. We split the mozzarella cheese stick appetizer, which was amazing! I had the Parmesan-Crusted chicken with macaroni and cheese and tomato/mozzarella salad. I liked the concept of this dish, just wish it would've been a little bit hotter.  My friend had a chicken/shrimp skillet (I don't remember what it was called) and he enjoyed his meal, too. We both had the brownie obsession for dessert- hands down the best brownie I've ever eaten! Sam was our waitress, and she was lovely. We'll definitely come back to this TGI Friday's! Review #183.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-4,,,,,
6,Stephen P.,"Longview, TX",0,11,1.0,2.0,2017-02-24,Service was extremely slow and they weren't even that busy.  The food was the only thing that gave this one better than one star.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-4,,,,,
8,Shana G.,"Finleyville, PA",2,13,,1.0,2017-03-19,"Won't be back. Appetizers were frozen and brought to us barely warm.  Salad only contained a few of the ingredients listed. French onion soup was beef broth and less than a handful of onions. Service was ok but once we complained about the food, we became an after thought in bring served.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-4,,,,,
5,Haley R.,"Monaca, PA",108,30,1.0,1.0,2017-07-02,Stopped here on a whim and have to say the bartender couldn't have possibly seemed LESS interested in serving us or anyone at the bar for that matter. My husband ordered the chicken sandwich which came with about 10 French fries and I had a chicken Caesar salad which was below average. I asked for more dressing and when it came out it was super watery and gross looking so I passed on eating it- kinda sketchy. It was pretty empty in there and seemed like there were way too many employees on the clock- they were just standing around talking and counting their tips. We left our card and the tab on the bar and the bartender disappeared for over 10 minutes. There were at least 5 other employees standing there and no one even offered to cash us out. I wish I had read the reviews for this location before going here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-4,,,,,
4,Kelly A.,"Clarksburg, WV",20,1,,3.0,2017-09-26,"Great cheesburger, weird Mac n cheese burger, breaded Mac n cheese piece rather than pictured cheesy macaroni melted. Fast service, quickly seated. Super good hot fries!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-4,,,,,
0,Stef W.,"Monongahela, PA",35,84,49.0,3.0,2017-11-28,"I am not too pleased with the quality of food at TGI Fridays these days. Some items on their menu are great, while others are seriously disappointing. The Jack Daniels sliders with Coca-Cola caramelized onions were to die for. I could have ate those all day long! Then my main course came out. I ordered the French dip sandwich. It was almost 100% fat. I mean fat that you can't even chew through...like pure rubber. I wish I would have taken a picture. I've worked in food service in the past, and I always said I would never serve somebody food that I wouldn't eat myself. This meat was so inedible... I would feel bad even making my dog eat it. I think I got about three good bites out of the entire sandwich and the rest I just had to throw away. I was very disappointed by this because I left still hungry. Pro: The drink menu is phenomenal. Tons of different cocktails that I have never heard of or could even dream up. The cotton candy mojito is my all time favorite.  Sadly this isn't the first time I've been disappointed by a TGI Fridays and I'm sure it won't be my last. I I think maybe in the future I'll stick to their happy hour because their drinks are very good and maybe some more of those Jack Daniels sliders.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-4,,,,,
2,Nicole F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",76,95,151.0,4.0,2017-12-07,Steph is great. Food and service are good. Folks are friendly. Tori is awesome. They always make me feel welcome. Fast and efficient. Good for accommodating large parties. Bartenders are very friendly. Bathrooms are always clean. Food is usually very speedy. The people behind the house are very good at their jobs.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-4,,,,,
