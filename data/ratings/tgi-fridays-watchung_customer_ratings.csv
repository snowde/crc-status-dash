Ordered an Irish coffee- must've been made with 2% milk.  Got tired of hearing .. No we don't have that tonight.. Had to settle for basic fried (Fridays) shrimp.  Burger roll was SERIOUSLY dried out!  My husband asked for onions on his burger - later the waiter said - 'Sorry, we're out of onions' napkins didn't arrive until the doggy bags did. Great for a beer around the bar watching the Giants game, but no place for the group of us",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watchung?start=40,1.768,1.768,1.768,1.768,1.7680000000000002

There was a long wait for my appetizer, but after that, service-wise, everything was fine. Food was in-between ok to perfect. Here's what I had: Fried Mozzarella - Very crispy coating with a gooey center. So gooey, that you may have a hard time trying to get all of that cheese onto your fork while breaking it apart from that other part of the mozzarella. ;) The dipping sauce was hot and fresh! Jack Daniel's Smoked Grilled Chicken Breasts - Those of you who have cravings for smoked, grilled meat with tasty BBQ sauce will LOVE this. WOO!!!! :D Parmesan Steak Fries - Could have been better, I could barely taste the Parmesan. A little more of that cheese for those fries would have tasted a lot better. Sure I was able to dip that with the Jack Daniel's sauce, but come on.  Fresh Vegetables Medley - Not so fresh. In fact, it didn't look or taste fresh at all. Edible, but not perfect. Dipping that in the BBQ sauce didn't help either. Overall, it was a fine experience. Getting two complimentary sides with my Jack Daniel's dish was a reasonable value.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watchung,2.096,2.096,2.096,2.096,2.096

40,Sue K.,"Cranford, NJ",10,34,,1.0,2014-06-09,"I wish I could write about the food at the Watchung Friday's. Or even just the drinks. But I can't, as we never got the chance to try them, thanks to a truly baffling service experience. I've been to this Friday's in the past, and it's been okay. My boyfriend and I have had bad service experiences at other Friday's locations, but the other night we were on our way someplace else, and because this Friday's was on our way, we figured we'd give the chain one more chance, against our better instincts. What a mistake. The first sign should have been that there was no wait on a Saturday at 8 p.m. The restaurant was about half full, and the hostess led us to a table in a well-occupied area of the floor. On the way, she joked about us ""not being [her] first priority,"" and we laughed accommodatingly. We should have taken her at her word -- that attitude, no joke, extended to the entire service staff. It seemed a little odd that with the four or five service people bustling around the area, attending to the other tables, nobody stopped by to take our drink order after a few minutes. One of the servers was taking great care to explain the menu and take detailed instructions from the people at the table across from us, which I saw as a positive sign of good customer service. I thought that she might also be our server, which would have explained the delay, but she then blew right past us without even acknowledging us. Meanwhile, other people were seated near us and other servers came by to ask for their drink orders.  Were we invisible? The only indication I have that we weren't is that the hostess didn't attempt to seat anyone at our table while we were there. Maybe some sort of cloak of invisibility shielded us after we were seated? I don't know. It's a mystery. I could have understood the confusion if they'd seated us in a section that had just opened up for the night. Shift changes cause confusion, but this was clearly an area that was being heavily serviced. People around us were getting food, but for some reason, our table was treated like a quarantine island.  After 20 minutes of being ignored, we'd had enough. My boyfriend was going to make a visit to the hostess station to see why no-one had come to take our order, but I suggested we just leave instead. After being denied service for so long, I didn't want to have to wait another half hour for food that might or might not be edible. And at a chain restaurant, which presumably has corporate-mandated training and standards for customer service, we shouldn't have to draw attention to ourselves just to get a bite to eat.  It was particularly galling that so many service people had walked past our table in that 20 minutes without acknowledging us or at least letting the server who (presumably) was assigned to our table know that we were sitting there with closed menus on the table, looking ready to place an order.  Needless to say, we won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watchung?start=20,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001

39,Soojin C.,"Palisades Park, NJ",38,14,6.0,1.0,2014-06-26,"Probably the worst service I have ever experienced. I thought I just had bad luck that night when I went here, but my parents went here for dinner and had exactly the same experience I had.  It took 15 minutes for us to just get our water and menu. We were sitting there for so long. The service didn't improve after that. They either need to hire better staff or hire MORE staff. It was ridiculous how long we were in there. The food was mediocre, nothing terrible, nothing amazing. It was what you would expect at a Fridays. But in my opinion, service is just as important as the food. And in this case, service was definitely disappointing.  So unless you want to spend 2+ hours at dinner, mostly waiting for your food...

The irony of it all was they weren't even that busy!  This establishment doesn't even deserve a rating.  One star is too much praise and would acknowledge they have something resembling any kind of service,  which they clearly don't.  However, since Yelp requires a rating, they will begrudgingly get that one, single, solitary, lonely star.

Typical Fridays but it was kind of on the messy side. I normally go to the Piscataway location and it's much neater then this place.

When we finely got sat place was hot not just warm hot to the point of being uncomfortable and our table was sticky and was going to remain sticky cause the 5 times I asked it wasn't addressed. 18 mins for a water 31 minutes for a beer the wrong beer as well. I asked for the sam's seasonal  despite the server not knowing what it was and even having to look on the menu himself. We ordered our food green been crisper took 46 mins. He came over once not to apologize  about the wait just to say ""dam still?"" The party behind us go nice shots to go in a nice  styrofoam cup but I couldn't get my 2nd beer to stay at all. 4 different  entrées and 2 different appetizers were brought to our table all the wrong ones.

The chicken and shrimp had a metallic taste and the green mush  I assume was broccoli. I didn't get my  Bourbon barrel chicken till 10 minutes behind the chicken and shrimp. The shrimp was cold way to hard to eat and was almost a  cement  color. Halfway threw my food that i was finely given a flat warm beer that I waited 20 mins on again coulda been the sams seasonal coulda been a Corona  waiter didn't know either so i ended up with blue moon this time though.

They said we are leaving but not before we talked to a manger. The manager came over and he said the service here ""Sucks"" and they walked out. Another couple seated across from us yelled. ""Ain't that right and the food is terrible too"". The manger walked away talking under his breath. After another 10 minutes we got up to leave. I said to thee hostess. We are leaving to. 30 minutes and no one has come over. Her response ""so what do you want me to do""!!  The restaurant was dirty. The isle had food all over the floor and servers walked back and forth the entire 30 minutes we sat there and no one cleaned it up. Our table wasn't cleaned, entire restaurant looked dirty. We won't ever go back. Don't waste your time. Too many other better choices in the area!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watchung,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
3,Robert M.,"Mountainside, NJ",1,38,28.0,1.0,2017-05-18,Food was good but our waitress took over 20 mins to wait on us. Then we asked for the bill and watched her wait on other tables and forget about us this time over 25 mins.  Today 4-23-17 ordered out and took the bar staff 15 mins to wait on me. I even mentioned to one of the bartenders that i was here for a takeout order. Place needs an intervention.....fast,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watchung,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
11,Tee L.,"Woodbridge, Woodbridge Township, NJ",0,2,,1.0,2017-06-01,HORRIBLE SERVICE. Drink was WRONG.Food was WRONG. Waiter didn't even acknowledge me. Other waiter caught an attitude with me because I asked for napkins. NEVER coming back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watchung,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
19,Zach S.,"Scotch Plains, NJ",0,2,,1.0,2017-06-03,"The service here that I got was a complete circus. My waitress was such a joke. It took 20 minutes for her to give me my drink and it wasn't even remotely crowded. When I placed an order for an appetizer special, she comes back and gives me separate apps jacking up the price on my order. I told her, ""I ordered a special, not all of these apps separately,"". She tells me she'll fix it right away and got really testy with me. Right away my ass. She tried to avoid me like she was scared of me. Never coming back here again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watchung,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
10,Ashley C.,"Watchung, NJ",0,6,1.0,1.0,2017-07-05,"To be honest they used to be a lot better, now they truly suck. The quality of their food has diminished to slim to none. I always get the pecan crusted chicken salad and each time it gets worse and worse. The lettuce and kale is wilted, the oranges seem like they have been sitting out, they always forget ingredients. You are better off going to Somerville or Union for Friday's. Don't waste your money or time there. ?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watchung,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
8,Travels A.,"Berkeley Heights, NJ",0,14,2.0,1.0,2017-07-08,"Words can not describe how absolutely horrible this Fridays has become. It used to be a good place to take the kids or stop in for a quick bite.   Unfortunately the place has been going down hill for the last 3-4 years and has finally hit rock bottom.  The hostess was completely unprofessional and thoroughly seemed annoyed at our request for silverware..... after our dinners had bee brought to the table!!!   Floors and tables were dirty, manager was utterly clueless and useless when we talked to him. Server was pleasant but wow if it wasn't there first day, then they should look at a new line of work.  Just stay away is my best advice unless you are going to sit at the bar",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watchung,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
1,E C.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",0,15,,1.0,2017-08-04,"NEVER GO HERE- incredibly rude staff.. We stopped in last nt. (fri 8/3/17) at 7:30pm waited at the front door to be seated apparently we're invisible so then wandered to the bar & found 2 empty seats.  We sat there for 10 mins & had 2 female bartenders walk past us - No one acknowledged we were there or asked if we needed menu's, Not even a ""hello I'll be with you in a minute""  There was a guy next to me who said he's been trying to pay his bill for 20 mins but they kept ignoring him.   I've stopped here for a Sunday NFL beer and have never been treated bad by anyone unlike those 2 bartenders last nt. We left after sitting there & feeling like we interrupted their night & since they clearly they don't need our business or tips.  We left and ate dinner at the Stage House Tavern 2 mins away --GREAT PLACE BTW..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watchung,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92

Looks like the clientele here was total garbage people cursing at the bar around small children. The amount time we wait for food and drinks was beyond annoying! I be surprised if they don't close up shop at this location! Manger need to be replaced and staff",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watchung,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003
12,S L.,"Millington, Millington, NJ",0,3,,1.0,2017-08-19,"If I could could give 0 stars I would! When I first walked in the breezeway smelt like sweaty old socks. Very stuffy. Then when I was walking to where I was going to be seated the floor was so freaking sticky that my flip flop almost got stuck to the floor. The waiter was an absolute idiot. It took almost 25-30 minutes just to get a glass of water. And the place was not even busy!!!Then when I got it, I asked for no lemon and they gave me lemon! After that, I ordered my food; a plain American cheeseburger well done with a side of broccoli. When I received my food I got a bacon cheeseburger with the wrong cheese and I had also asked for no pickles and they put pickles on it. The broccoli was absolutely disgusting. Never coming back here again!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watchung,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002
7,Kary W.,"Bayonne, NJ",22,2,,1.0,2017-08-29,The service here is absolutely horrible. The hostess is never at the station so you have to wait to be seated in an empty restaurant.

0,Temmie D.,"New Providence, NJ",1,8,10.0,3.0,2017-11-05,I have been here many times and I will say the food is really good. They have a wide selection of food for good prices. The problems are that it take a long time for the waiter/waitress to come  to the even get drinks. I ordered the rib eye which was cooked to my liking with a tomato mozzarella salad and fries. I don't get the fries so I was a little displeased but I still ate the other side because they probably would take the whole tray out and that would make me even more hungry. Our server Anna was very nice and got us our refills without us having to ask which was pleasant. If yo will go here go early so it isn't packed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watchung,1.68,1.68,1.68,,1.6800000000000002
4,Michael P.,"Fanwood, NJ",22,17,13.0,1.0,2017-11-08,"Small wonder this place is empty most of the time, not the most attentive wait staff. Three times our waiter walked by our table (with empty drinks) and didn't notice. Trying to get his attention failed twice.

2,Colleen E.,"NJ, NJ",23,2,7.0,1.0,2017-12-26,"My experience with this place was horrible and I will never set foot in there again. The place was absolutely filthy-a real dump. The floors hadn't been swept, there were numerous tables that needed to be cleared (some were piled high with dishes) and don't get me started on the bathroom. Paper towels and toilet paper everywhere, garbage and sanitary items overflowing from their receptacles! The service was pretty bad too. They only had one menu to give us and we had to ask for utensils. We waited a long time every step of the way. To top it all off, I was so displeased I asked to speak to the manager and he couldn't care less! He just nonchalantly said they were understaffed and told us to have a good night. The brussels sprouts were terrible and so bitter we had to send them back. I asked for sour cream and she said they didnt have any. NEVER AGAIN!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watchung,1.64,1.64,1.64,,1.6400000000000001
