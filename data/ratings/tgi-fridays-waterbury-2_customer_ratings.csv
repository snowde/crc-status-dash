46,Christopher C.,"Naugatuck, CT",6,70,,2.0,2012-04-02,"Honestly I have grown more and more displeased with TGI Friday's in general. Their prices keep rising and their portion sizes keep shrinking. But usually the food is quite good. At this particular TGI Friday's, however.... the food is not even up to the standards I have come to know at TGI Friday's.... and the service isn't that good either. The Chili's a few dozen yards away, however.... is quite good and I would recommend that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-waterbury-2?start=60,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000004

66,Albert P.,"Naugatuck, CT",0,11,,3.0,2012-11-05,"Well... it's a TGIFs. Pretty much exactly what you would expect from such a place.  Came in on at 7.30pm on a Wednesday and waited 5-7 minutes for the host to show up. I do not know where he was or what he was doing, but it is kind of awkward standing there that long contemplating if you should leave and walk over to the Buffalo Wild Wings for better service. This was the low point of the meal. Waiter was extremely friendly and this mentality appears to carry on through the staff here. We had the queso with beef dip and chips for appetizer which was pretty good. I myself had boneless wings with the Carribean bourbon sauce for a meal and the fiancee had a small steak with mashed potatoes and parmesan fries. The fries were for me and was delicious. She enjoyed her meal also. If you have ever been to a TGIFs before than you know what to expect. Like any other quality chain elements of the chain have strong similarities regardless of where you are in the world. The awkward wait initially by the host knocked the score down a star but the extremely good service nullified this lost. You like TGIF then you will still like it after coming to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-waterbury-2?start=40,1.9320000000000002,1.9320000000000002,1.9320000000000002,1.9320000000000002,1.9320000000000004
64,Jamie L.,"Watertown, CT",69,190,,4.0,2013-07-30,"I personally happen to like TGIF no matter where I go. I usually tend to try to stay away from the bar on this one, only because of how loud it is. If you sit on the other side of the restaurant it tends to get a little more quieter and you can actually hear the other person you're with. The service has never been anything shy of good. My waiters/waitresses are always very attentive and check on us at least a couple times to make sure everything is great. The only thing I will say about this location is I absolutely love the green bean fries TGIF's offers, but the last 3 times I've gotten them from this particular restaurant, I've gotten sick. And it's ONLY that one item because after I get sick, I'm fine. it's the weirdest thing. Other than that, food is always great and tasty. I don't really have many complaints about this chain :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-waterbury-2?start=40,1.968,1.968,1.968,1.968,1.968

It was a hotspot for the young crowd.  Somewhere down the line they changed. no more red & white stripes with flare, no more young vibrant atmosphere. Now it's the equivalent of an AppleBees.  ""Meh"". The food is decent but nothing ""wow"" about it. It's where people on a budget go out for a ""fancy dinner"", NOT a place for foodies or the like.

62,Jason K.,"Waterbury, CT",53,328,700.0,3.0,2014-03-11,"Really came a long way. When it first opened, I thought it was expensive and the food wasn't great. Since then I have enjoyed their drinks and food. Nachos are great there and the chicken is worth a look, but not the price. The place is clean considering where it is, but it still has that grungy waterbury feel on the inside. Especially the bathrooms. Parking lot is horrible. Can never get a spot without parking across the lot. Staff is very friendly and concerned about their customers. For example, the bartender poured a guy a drink, noticed it had not been cleaned thoroughly and re-poured him that very same drink in another glass (foam everywhere in dirty glass). If you are looking for some late night fun, TGI Friday's is a nice choice, but there are better alternatives.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-waterbury-2?start=40,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002

57,Better B.,"Bethel, CT",3,207,2.0,2.0,2014-08-02,"Wow, was that really a Fridays? Arrived about 10pm, hostess advised they'd clear a table for us! Kind of a surprise that late in the evening that they're not keeping up on the housekeeping. Meet our waiter Brad, very friendly, very attentive and responsive. Food comes, all appy's for our late evening snack and even my teen age son eventually utters the phrase ""underwhelmed"" as he pokes one serving around the plate with his finger. This is a guy that will eat raw poptarts and pbj's if left to his own devices. Potato skins, always a great standby,...these looked very familiar. Definitely not the large half skins with fresh cheese and bacon melted inside that you normally see at TGIF's, what we got were the thin quarter potato pieces, with blobby off color, putty textured cheese. I swear, they're TGIF skins from the grocery store. While they're hot, they look like they just slid out of the box from the freezer. BBQ chicken flatbread. Did I miss something? Is the chicken BBQ'd? No BBQ sauce on the flatbread, just a glaze of multicolored cheeses. Again, everything looks dull and oddly textured, like it was frozen a half hour earlier.  Finally Sesame Jack Chicken Strips. First off, we get chicken pieces, nugget shaped/sized chunks rather than anything of length that would resemble a ""strip"", but at least it was whole chicken. Overcooked into crunchy flavorless challenges. We choked these down, total fail, but it's late and we wanted out of there.  TGI's is not cheap, the food has to measure up. This experience pushes the chain as a whole down a peg or two as we work our way through shopping districts with multi choices. Was the wait staff doing the cooking and following the directions from grocery store packaging? This should never happen, 0-3 on appetizers. It's nearly criminal.  A quick walk to the uninspired mens room, found the back half of the restaurant with slipperly, greasy floors, like a KFC.....We were deadlocked on BWW vs TGIF as we entered the parking lot. I broke the tie and headed to Fridays because we're usually pretty happy with the contents of the long plates.

Within ten minutes my food was an ice bucket.  It's a Sunday during football season and NONE of the TVs in the bar were set to the game. Until my fiancé asked to change the program that was already on three other TVs.

Really don't bother unless you want to sit at the bar. The restaurant is just not well attended too. We were shown to our table very promptly, but all the surrounding tables were still cluttered with previous meals left overs etc. Which stayed that way all through our visit.  Our server took ages to come and talk to us and take a drinks order, she was friendly enough, but then she went directly to the front area and spent a good 10 minutes or so chatting with a friend there before putting in our orders. I think the staff try, but its just a reflection of the management or the area that brings this place down. The food is actually not that great, good for a meal to keep you going, but not worth driving to for an occasion etc. Best advice is to go to Chili's across the parking lot. Atmosphere is better, staff are more lively, foods better. It will be a long long time till we return here, if at all. - it probably deserves to close down and be replaced something better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-waterbury-2?start=40,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.084,2.48

I went here last night with my sister. We ordered an apple martini and boneless hot wing app. The wings came before the drinks. 10 minutes later our apple martinis came. First off let me just say I knew their drinks were always disgusting , but in my mind how can u f&@$ up a dam martini? But yea they f@&$ed it up. Lol smh. It wasn't even green? Is this a yellow apple martini? And who puts ice in a martini? wtf ?Whatever, it was happy hour so I just let it slide blaming myself for even bothering.  We both ordered grilled salmon with lobster sauce and mash. Delicious! We ordered another hot wing app to take home. The waitress convinced us to just order the all u can eat apps for 10 bucks seeing it would be the same price. Was ready to go didn't really want too but we did anyway. The wings we first ordered were actually really good. The wings they brought out the second time were disgusting! Old burnt oil taste. What happened? Yall burnt the oil that fast since the first round? No thank you. My sister says the all you can eat apps are the reject wings from other orders lol. She might just be right!

Requested the check for my one martini that in total waited almost an hour for and took my business to chilis right in the same lot.  Got seated served and left in the amount of time I waited for my 1 martini at Friday's,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-waterbury-2?start=40,1.96,1.96,1.96,2.052,1.96

We ordered some beer which had a skunky flavor to them, so we sent them back and requested to sample other beers so we could find something we liked.  We tried 2-3 IPAs and they were both watered down and had zero flavor.  We then decided to get bottled beer and even that was bad, another watered down IPA followed by a Coors Light which we decided to tolerate even though it too had no flavor.  During this time the manager on duty came out and gave us some obviously BS excuses as to why 6 different beers were either watered down or tasted like garbage. We ordered food as well which took forever to come out. It was okay, not really worth the price of going out.   I hate to bash them because our server was being very patient with us and we could tell he was really trying, but there is no way in hell that many problems could occur in one restaurant without some type of negligence toward food/beverage quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-waterbury-2?start=20,2.36,2.36,2.36,1.5720000000000003,2.36

And when you do order a second round of apps, the serving is reduced. One of the apps was the meatballs, first of which we received 4, then on the second round we received 3. The boneless buffalo wings were dry and the chicken flatbread, which was actually very good, they ran out of after the first serving.
