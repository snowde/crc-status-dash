5,Debbie M.,"Houston, TX",5,119,18.0,2.0,2015-08-25,Ordered the famous pecan crusted chicken salad. The chicken was dry. The chicken tasted like it was cooked yesterday then heated in a microwave. Such a shame these Friday's are nowadays. I remember the Fridays of the 80's: YUM. The ones now are subpar. Great server today. It's not his fault the kitchen is lazy.

The next day get a call from my bank someone at the bay area location tried to run my credit card for $357.  Thank God the charge was denied but the hassle of it all and the nerve of someone trying to steal money that's not theirs.

31,Brittany T.,"Friendswood, TX",37,12,6.0,3.0,2016-03-25,"Warmly greeted at the front door to be promptly seated right next to to others families and told it was ""shift change,"" which is no excuse really to not be seated one table further than them. I was asked 2 separate times if I was ready to order while looking at my menu. I wish she understood that my mannerisms and general obvious indecision I had hence the looking AT MY MENU, that I was NOT READY TO ORDER YET. After a third time, I decided on the Ahi tuna ceasar salad which was quite good, but only came with 3 pieces of tuna. My bf got the half rack of ribs with 12 fries and a very tasty coleslaw with a bit of a bite. All in all, I just wish the server was more aware of the obvious things.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-webster,,,,,
2,Paul G.,"League City, TX",0,12,,3.0,2016-04-10,"Visited on a Saturday evening. Not very busy at all due to nearby road construction near the mall.  Had the Endless Apps deal, which is a good value, but were slow to receive the first couple rounds of appetizers.  Service was pleasant and attentive, but when I couldn't finish the last app I was told I couldn't have a box to bring it home -- apparently it's not allowed with Endless Apps because too many people order a bunch of apps and just take them home. I get it there are some gluttons out there, but for people who obviously aren't trying to scam the system there's no harm in giving people a take-home box! Very frustrating.  Apparently Endless Apps is going away soon so it's a moot point, but assuming it comes back next time I'll probably go to a different location where they're willing to ""bend the rules.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-webster?start=20,,,,,

The Bloody Mary hangover brunch is pretty cool- we honestly just came here because we wanted to take pics with their decked out bloody Mary's.

35,Ian V.,"Houston, TX",36,6,,1.0,2016-08-06,Asked bus boy to sit us at a table furtherest  away from a smoker he brings us next to a smoker and he is like there is like a window. My wife is pregnant so we did not appreciate that as well as we had to go find our own table. Management has gone way down in the last year. One star because of inconsiderate buss boy and slow service our waiter was great though just stuck working for a terrible management.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-webster,,,,,
4,Stephanie C.,"Deer Park, TX",1,22,18.0,1.0,2016-09-10,"My one star is because my apps were cooked perfectly. Not burnt or old tasting. I have been going to Friday's every other weekend recently but this location is crap. I walked in and the host just stared at me so I said table for 2 please. Still not a word then he showed us to our table and told us a waiter would be right with us. I was hoping for endless apps but was told by the waiter that endless apps ended a few days prior so that was sad. The entire time I was almost gagging on the smell of cigarette smoke I had no clue the restaurant allowed this, I find it crazy! The moment the waiter approached he did not say hi. He placed napkins down and quietly said ""I'm...(couldn't hear name) I'll be your server, what would u like to drink"" I honestly had to lean in towards him because I could not hear a word he was saying. He didn't once smile and just flat out looked like he did not want to be serving us. Once I ordered he brought the food put it down and walked away without saying a word. The entire time I ate he did not come to the table. Once I was done with my plate he came by took that and again did not say a word or make any eye contact. About 5 minutes later he brought the check dropped it off and didn't say a word just kept walking past the table. I paid he walked by picked up the check book and quietly said ""thanks"" as he kept walking. Never saw him again. I don't believe this guy is cut out for waiting tables, he might be better suited for a library. Needless to say I will NEVER return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-webster?start=20,,,,,
3,Dawn G.,"Pico Rivera, CA",0,11,1.0,1.0,2016-09-20,"We went in on Friday Sept 16th evening around 8:30pm. We had a large group with us, however the tables weren't all that packed. Not as busy as the manager claimed. Told us it would be a 2 hr wait if we all wanted to sit together or he could seat us separately asap. Then proceeded to tell my husband that the tables are very close to each other so a couple of our friends from our party may not fit... REALLY!!!!! Then after sitting all of us around at separate tables throughout the restaurant, got a major attitude when we found out there were 4 empty tables near some of the rest of our party and asked if we could move closer to them. My major issues with this location are: 1. Management SUCKS!!!! Have some understanding and be considerate to your customers, after all they are giving you your paycheck!!! 2. Servers: be more attentive to your tables, we waited 20 minutes then had to get up looking for you just to get our check.  3. Seating: don't sit the tables so close to each other that a customer is snaking another with hair or arms just to move.  We will NOT return to this location!!! Recommendation, if you are a big person, don't go to this location. The manager is horribly inconsiderate",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-webster?start=20,,,,,

I placed my app order got my beer and still no one bothered to clean up the SEVERAL tables that were dirty... me and my family were literally siting in the middle of this mess.  After waiting and waiting and just staring at all those dirty tables I lost my appetite and just canceled my order as I wondered how dirty is their kitchen... nope sorry I pass. As I refuse to eat while I'm surrounded by filth. There was another family that walked out before us.  The waiter Chris was nice and polite which made me feel a bit awful leaving like that but I was not rude or mean either.  The management is definitely lacking. ... my daughter face says it all.

18,John D.,"La Marque, TX",59,177,290.0,2.0,2017-03-25,"The two stars are in regards to the fish and chips, which I tried out of curiosity. It was a mistake I regret. The fish was too hot and had a bit of an iron flavor, the cole slaw was too dry, and the fries were bland at best though it's a bit of my fault for not using ketchup. If there was a saving grace to my dinner, that would be the green bean fries. Dip those bad boys in the cucumber wasabi dip provided. Your taste buds will love you for it.

I ordered today online the black bean burger with avocado. Typically this burger is dressed with lettuce and tomato and onion and avocado. We only asked for no onions.  Once I got home the sandwich was the saddest thing.  Also I waited at the bar for the order. The bartender, Christopher, served me. He was pleasant but after I ordered a drink I wasn't ready to leave. He already rung up my little order. I was thinking come on and ask first.

The loaded potatoes are good too, I don't think you can go wrong on potatoes. Overall my service was excellent.  Sorry no pics this time, I was starving.

Their 4 dollar house LIT can't be beat.  I will say they used to be WAAAYYYYY more lenient in their bar. For example,  the bartenders would tell me to name something and they can make it for 4 dollars, so i always ordered Captain and Diet with lime...that drink is now more pricey and they do not let u stray from the drink specials they have listed for the day so that's a bummer.  If you don't have your ID, you ain't drinking so have it ready...even if you're elderly they don't let it slide. I love that you can still smoke the bar. I usually sit at a booth surrounding the bar but u can smoke there too.
