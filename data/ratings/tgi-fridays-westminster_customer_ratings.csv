26,Julie L.,"Garden Grove, CA",1169,772,2497.0,4.0,2013-11-26,"Grand opening day.  No banners, no specials...but 3 workers said excitedly it was their grand opening.  Same ole TGIF to me, just cleaner than most.  :) $17 Jack Daniels chicken & shrimp.  My 2 sides were the thick cut parm garlic fries & the tomato + mozzarella salad.  My 2 y/o easily finished off half my chicken which looked like 2/3 of a chicken breast.  The fries were wedges fried to a crisp & tossed in butter/garlic/parm.  Which initially sort of grossed me out because they come out saucy looking.  My hubs didn't like it but they grew on me.  The salad was a nice fresh change to usual salad offerings. The portions are not that great for the amount you pay but it could be my ""America, f'yeah!"" mentality.  They have a decent points program & I like their happy hour options & tvs:tables ratio.  I'll be back.  p.s.  LEAH is a great server if you get her.  Attentive & helpful & you can tell she was excited to be there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westminster?start=100,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997
189,Dustin V.,"Redlands, CA",7,6,,3.0,2013-11-30,"Their food was pretty good. I had the Blue Cheese Stacked Burger, they were not stingy on the cheese. it's a little pricy, two burgers and an iced tea aren't worth 28 bucks +tip imo. It kinda bothered me that they use plastic cups to serve their beverages. The service was good but pretty slow, it seemed like their employees didn't have a sense of urgency. The tables seem a little too close together, I could hear both conversations going on next to me.

249,Jennifer A.,"Seal Beach, CA",0,52,,3.0,2013-12-01,"Grand opening day, nov. 26. There was no wait, which was good. A lot of people, (employees) standing around the front sign in area, they all said the same thing as we walked in. I understand they are ""trained"" to welcome you, but c'mon, when the first person standing next to you says welcome to Fridays how many? And you answer ""2"",why do 2 more people need to ask you the same thing? Our waitress was ""over the top"" with her thumbs up gestures and saying the word ""fantastic"" after everything we ordered.  The food is super pricey for what you get. We ordered chips and salsa appetizer, just a handful of chips in the basket. When we asked for more they said they could give us more but they'd have to charge us for more salsa. We declined.  My husband had the jack Daniels chicken, it comes with two chicken breasts and a tiny little bit of sauce. When he asked for sauce the overly excited waitress told him there would be an extra charge. It was already $17 you'd think they could spare a teaspoon of the jack Daniels sauce on the jack Daniels chicken? Nope. Kinda did it for us. Chili""s down the street has 2 for $20 with endless chips and salsa, extras are no charge and they have many more  choices on the menu.  We won't be back Fridays.

205,P S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",20,53,25.0,4.0,2013-12-06,You can definitely tell they just opened. The servers and staff were extremely friendly but seemed flustered and forgot a lot of things. The layout was nice and the food was good. Same as all the other TGIFridays. I wish the prices were a little lower for what you get though. All in all it's a nice place to go out with friends and they have some good Happy Hour deals.

220,Paulina A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",254,118,99.0,1.0,2013-12-07,"So I was so excited to come to this TGIF's as I saw it being build in the mall.  I went here after work with my boyfriend and our friends. The  atmosphere is really nice. The restaurant is huge, very clean, and nicely decorated. Sounds good right? NOPE. The service absolutely sucked. We were greeted at the door, and the greeter took us to be seated. I forgot his name but he was really nice! Then came our waiter.....he started off okay, but as the night went on, the service kept getting worse and worse. We ordered 2 appetizers, the spinach dip and the grande nachos. And for our entree meals we order a chicken plate and two steak plates. We also ordered the strawberry lemonade which was fantastic, but super pricy. They also basically filled the whole cup with crushed small ice so it was a rip off.($4 each + 50 cents for refill) We waited for about 45 minutes until our waiter came back, I believe his name was Paul. He told us he was sorry that we hadn't got our food yet and blah blah, and decided to go to the back and check.  Ten minutes later, our food finally came out after one hour, and to top it off my boyfriends order was wrong. He ordered a steak and overemphasized to our waiter that he wanted it extra well done, it came out medium-rare. One of the cooks brought it out with the older manager (he was a guy), and before setting the plate on the table the cook mentioned the steak was medium-rare, we told her we wanted it well-done and quickly after the manager corrected her saying it was well-done, just so we would take the plate.  The other manager came to our table (Ashley) and she was super nice and helpful. She gave my boyfriend the option of throwing his same steak on the grill or a brand new one. The only downside to the new one was that it would take another 20+ min, and after waiting for about an hour and a half now we just decided to take the old one.  Another twenty minutes went by and we finally got the steak and our appetizers. Ironic right? I thought appetizers came before the main meal. Anyways Ashley told us she would cover the appetizers, which in the end was no big deal since it was happy hour and appetizers are 50% off. the total was less than 8 dollars. After we finally got our meals, we had to ask Paul our waiter for refills on drinks and water and he only remembered one of our orders for a refill on lemonade. My boyfriend had to ask another waiter for water since our own waiter wouldn't bring it to us. We got the bill and the total was $70 after the appetizers were covered, for three plates and lemonades. SUCH A RIP OFF. Oh and our waiter had the balls to tell us to go online and take a survey, but don't mention any of the bad stuff that happened, or if we did, to just blame it on the kitchen, after all what happened. We spent 2.5+ hours at this place, by far the worst service I've had, never coming back, and I'm surprised we even had to pay for our meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westminster?start=220,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308

However, the food was extremely extremely disappointing. It was a very very slow afternoon, maybe 10 or less tables in use. We ordered appetizers, pretzels and pot stickers. The pretzels were good but the pot stickers were cold and not even cooked all the way. I ordered a burger and fries and those came out luke-warm/cold. Not acceptable. Barbara offered to take it back but I hate sending food back so I ate half my burger and put the other in a box but I'll probably end up throwing that out. Casey also helped us by getting a box for our food and was very friendly. Its just the food is so disappointing. I was so excited to come here, but after today I'm not sure I'd return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westminster?start=320,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508

There were groups of employees standing in various locations talking to each other... After about 15 minutes of waiting our server took our order. 2 appetizers  and a pork chop. They forgot one appetizer and It took about 30 minutes for the food to come and it tasted like it had sat under a heat lamp for about 10 minutes. After finishing it took about 15 minutes to get a box and the check. meanwhile, at least 4 different employees passed by to go talk to the employees who were already off, sitting in the booth behind us.  So to sum it up, they were over staffed forgetful and inattentive. Maybe it's because it's a new store, but any decent manager wouldn't allow a store to operate in this fashion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westminster?start=220,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34

I was hungry and cranky when we got here.  Drinks, meat, and more drinks please!  TGIF received plenty of poor reviews regarding service.  Thankfully our service was fantastic that night. (""That night"" because I can't recall if it was Friday or Saturday coming here...) Food came out 30 min after ordering, which the manager, Ashley, thought was just wrong. She comped the burger.  Drinks were delicious but fell short on alcohol. That's where TGIF did not hit the 5 star mark.  Bartender was a little light on the alcohol which made our drinks taste juicy juicy, not alky alky. Our drinks tasted like Fruitopia. Who remembers Fruitopia drinks? WIth more time, this TGIF is on the right track towards being a great place to kick it.

The closest one before was the one at the block. And the best part is, this one isn't crowded because not very many people know about it. I guess that's not good for the owner though... Happy hr prices are fairly cheap. My margarita was good and strong. 6 drinks for 3 people and 2 basket of fries came out to be $35.  That's awesome for a Friday night ! Service was good as well. I did find a potato tag in my basket of fries that said ""best used by dec 18th 13"" though... I just put that aside and kept on eating. At least I knew I wasn't eating expired potatoes. Lol!

I walked into TGIF to buy a $25 gift card as a xmas gift around 11pm there was no one waiting to be seated nor a line ""score"" or so I thought. I talked to the hostess about the gift card and she seemed to have got the message across to whomever handles that. After waiting 15 min and then seeing a group of 2 walk in and then being seated I finally asked the hostess if someone was still getting that gift card, she looked at me as if she was experiencing deja vu. Guess what...they forgot even though I was the only person standing there this whole time, major fail. Never coming to this Fridays again that's for sure. This being a chain restaurant I'm sure the food and drinks taste the same as any other Fridays but this being my 1st impression at this new location it sure made a lasting one.

176,Philip V.,"Huntington Beach, CA",923,401,1528.0,4.0,2013-12-23,"I usually refrain from reviewing chain restaurants, but I decided to make an exception here because the bad reviews are written with injustice!...And also, I love TGIF. Maybe the yelp-hate is conjured up by the owner at Outback (located near there) or some other local restaurant? Lol  Either way, I for one am excited TGIF opened at Westminster mall because their happy hour is outrageously affordable and food is better than average--Come to the bar from 3-7pm or 10pm-close, Monday-Saturday, and you'll find tastefully good appetizers that are half off and heavy-handed drinks for under $5!  (This deal can also be found all-day on Sunday and isn't restricted to the bar.)   The one thing that isn't on the happy hour menu, but is a favorite of mine: The Jack Daniels Burger. The JD sauce has a whiskey taste that's subtle and veers more towards being sweet than anything, but the bacon, patty, and lettuce balance that out.  Perhaps sharing it with a friend is the best idea because people do say the sauce has a chemical like sweetness that's overwhelming, but I'm still a fan! For $10, I've had worse burgers.  Decor here is gorgeous and similar to Vegas.  I dislike how the TV's are placed, however, as they are a little too high.  Despite the negativity about it, the service for me was quick, smooth and friendly.  I'll definitely be back! ---- Conclusion: Thumbs up!

The happy hour here isn't very impressive for drinks, but most of the appetizers are half off! I ordered Nachos Grande and my friend ordered Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Pasta. The food didn't take too long, but then again there weren't many people there at 3 pm. The nachos didn't look very appetizing and the chicken was cubed into tiny pieces. The tortilla chips were a bit harder than I liked and overall the dish lacked flavor. I had to ask for extra melted cheese on the side. One waiter told me it wasn't possible without taking my dish back and reheating the cheese, while another waiter said it was possible and that the cheese was already melted. It took maybe 10-15 minutes for me to get the melted cheese... My friend claimed his dish didn't taste the same and the portion was much smaller. I never had it at other chains so I wouldn't know.

It was the worst TGIF I ever been too. First of all, I should have gave it one star, but since they didn't make us wait to be seat, so they get 2 stars. Long story short, we were ordering our food and it took like 30 minutes to come out. It was a Sunday, the restaurant was half empty, so it shouldn't take 30 to 35 minute to cook our food. Second, our server never bother to check in on us. I believe the only time he checked in on us is when he took our drinks order and our food order, that's about it. He also mess up my friends and my orders. I ordered french fries with my steak and he ended giving me some kind of potatoes wedges with melted cheese on it. I am not even sure if the server know what the difference between the two is. He also gave my friend a salad that has no dressing on it and lied that there is. Its the worst service I ever got from a TGIF. I seriously think they need to hired more experienced server for this location. Maybe then, their rating wouldn't be so low on yelp.

We walked over to the Target since the mall was closed for the evening. I got a text at 7:21 we walked back and were seated. Our waitress was terrible. She took our drinks 2 waters 1 coke and a chocolate milk for my daughter. Took her about 15 minutes to come back with the 2 waters and coke. No milk for my daughter.

When we came back from the restroom the first thing she asked was ""is our food here?"" no hunny, it's still not here.  She then asked if we could just leave, that's terrible when a four year old notices how long our food is taking.  Our food finally shows up about 45 -50 minutes after ordering. It was not very warm and the portions were kind of on the small side. Worse to say, my order was incorrect I ordered the grilled shrimp and he brought out shrimp scampi, when I tell the waiter (because it wasn't our terrible waitress) that the shrimp he brought out was wrong, he say's that's the only grilled shrimp they have (no it's not- i have eaten at other Friday's before). Fine i don't argue any more- will eat it. Cut into my steak and it's bloody. I like my meat well done, I can eat it if there's a little pink but there was blood coming out of it. Gross!!

We ordered the bleu cheese crumble burger, a chicken dish with some sweet teriyaki glaze, and a few mixed drinks. Both dishes were a total disappointment. I was really hungry but neither one tasted nearly edible. I was so bummed out. The burger patty was so dry and completely flavorless. The fries they gave us were old and stale also. They were probably sitting out for a long long time because they definitely did not taste fresh. Considering the price they charge for a burger, this was completely unacceptable. The chicken dish was just so blah. I love chicken but I couldn't even finish it even if I forced myself. The salsa did not even go along with it and the broccoli was wayy over cooked. It was just so soggy and tasted like baby food you didn't even need to chew it.  The only reason why I'm giving it two stars is because our waitress, whom I forgot her name, was a total sweetheart.

My advice is to please let your customers know when you guys are closing, especially if there is an hour or 30mins left till closing time, so they can decide if they still want to eat there or not.

My experiences here were never that good, but the server we had today was just awful. She did not know how to multitask at all. She walked by our table so many times, but never took attention to our table (unless we waved our hands at her) because she was so occupied about that one table she was attending to. It took her a good 10 minutes to get our drinks, which were just water!! The food took forever to come out as well, which I already knew from coming here so many times, but I think the server was just so slow that it probably took her forever to ring in our orders, so the wait time to get our food was doubled. She didn't refill our drinks when they were empty, we had to ask the busser for our refills. Honestly, the only time she was quick was to drop and pick up our checks. I wouldn't have been so harsh on this review if I knew she had a lot of tables, but she only had 4. She had our table (of 4 people), one was paying out, the other table (of 2) just got their food, and the other table were her friends. How did I know they were her friends? Because she apparently had the time to stand there and talk and laugh with them so many times. The hostess was talking to them too, so I guess they're the coworkers. It's so sad that I'm able to observe all of this. It just shows how slow and awful the whole experience was. I've never given any server a $0 tip and she was the winner. I just had to.

The manager does nothing besides stand at the bar. One waiter is responsible for an entire happy hour crowd. The hostess is an emergency waitress who is expected to do a crap load of stuff. French fries is the last thing out to the table behind wings and 2 sliders. You have to walk up to get your own refills at a sit down resteraunt.

That explanation included ""the bartenders would get mad at me"". I'm not sure what their policy on lemon is but you would think that as a server you would do anything in your power to make sure that the guest is satisfied. As a former server myself, I understood that my tip depended on whether or not the guest is pleased with their experience. This server seemed to care more about her COWORKER being displeased with her than she did about providing a great dining experience.  The lemon issue was only the beginning. I could seriously go on and on about how horrible our experience was but that would just be a waste of my time.

My chips were stale, the flatbread looked like it was left out for an hour, there were flies over our table and one landed in my friend's half drunk wine glass. The attitude and the half assed customer service was horrendous. EDITED: I forgot to say that all of our food was slightly warm to cold and my chips were stale. And she had the audacity to not give us our change until we asked for it. EDITED 2: yes, my waitress spoke perfect English (I was asked that question).

So we come in and we sit in a large booth. Since we were seated in the bar area we had some happy hour options to choose from if wanted. Our waitress was a nice person BUT she was OVERWORKED and understaffed for her area. There was a table of 3 and one of the guys in the party was taking so much of her time. I shit you not, he asked about every damn item on the menu and pretty much ordered the whole menu as well!!! He truly kept her from helping 6 to 7 other tables. What a dick he was, you're not the only muthafucka in here trying to eat!!!!!    Finally we put in our drink order. I ordered one of those crack sounding sangrias and my mother and sister ordered their usual non alchy iced teas. So we look over the menu and there are so many damn options! A million appetizers , entrees and just when you think you're done there inside the folds of the menu they have seafood now. Lookin like a Red lobster. We ordered a few things Pan seared pot stickers Bacon mac and cheese bites Parmesan meatballs Crab Cakes Shrimp cocktail Dinner salad Clam chowder   So everything was satisfying BUT the clam chowder. It was HOOOOOOORRRRRRIBLE! Shit was out of a can and wasn't even the right can, it was like can Cream of mushroom!!!!!!!! I told the kind waitress we love everything but the soup is just bad! I never send food back but this was so fucked up on so many clam chowder levels. The founder of this classic would be rolling over in his grave! The crab cakes were TASTY but lukewarm and became cold if you did not eat them immediately. The crab to breading ratio was awesome. Very moist cake, just make sure you get them hot! My mom said the shrimp cocktail was your standard shrimp cocktail like you get at the grocery store. Fresh skrimps but nothing like what my mom had at Slapfish last week LOL. The star of the show for me  were the meatballs! Came sauced up and a nice shave of parmesan cheese. The meatballs were super moist and I truly thought I was eating them at a very good Italian eatery.     Besides the minor setbacks and delay in service, we still had an enjoyable time and we will come back to try the rest of the newer menu :) Plus I LOOOOVED my pear sangria, so that drink menu needs to be slayed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westminster?start=120,2.6,2.17,2.17,2.508,2.342

I like the flat bread pizza that TGIF offers, tastes better than from Chili's in my opinion, you can have a different point of view regarding that.  No words to say or speak of this establishment.  We have heard enough and TGIF is well established brand and also has a place in people's hearts.  Whenever I swing by TGIF, I will have the flat bread pizza first, the rest second.  Just my personal taste, FYI, I do not say other meals on the menu are bad.

250,A S.,"Portland, OR",0,12,,2.0,2015-08-06,"The only reason we decided on TGI Friday's was because it was the closest place open at 11pm on Sunday night that we could find. Also, their fried green beans are our favorite. I ordered the bruschetta chicken pasta, or whatever it's called. However, I asked for no chicken since I'm vegetarian. The waiter mentioned that I could sub vegetables for the chicken, but I asked if I could sub a small side salad instead (in my mind that's no biggie because it's still vegetables). He went to ask his manager and came back asking what kind of dressing I wanted on my salad. Sweet vegetarian success!!! However, when the bill came and after we paid (our fault) we noticed that he charged us for the salad. I wasn't dying for a side salad of dried up lettuce that had probably been sitting around all day since it was almost closing time, so I wouldn't of gotten one if I knew it was going to be extra. It was only $2 and it was almost midnight so instead of going through the hassle of him refunding a mere $2 and some change to my credit card we just left. Point is, don't make it sound like I can sub the meat on my entree for a side salad when in reality you're just gonna charge me for it.

Really liked the balsamic glaze they use in it. It really tasted good together with the pasta and chicken.  Now on to why 1 star.  Drinks-My husband was smart and ordered a coke, can't go wrong with a simple coke. Wish I would of just ordered water. Instead I ordered a blended strawberry margarita. It came to the table looking really light pink almost looked like pink lemonade. I tried to take a drink and was met with a huge chunk of ice, so I used my straw and stirred it, tried again and still another chunk of ice. Mind you this was suppose to be ""blended""! I told the waitress to take it back and have the bartender blend it again, as I am watching the bartender he adds MORE ICE to the blender pours me drink in it and blends it for literately 3 seconds pours it in my cup and brings it to me. I take a drink and another ice chunk and it was so watered down it was gross.  Waitress and Staff-Lets just say ""Horrible"", It was about 5:15pm and there was a few people in the restaurant. We sat in the bar area. We sat there for at least 10 mins after the hostess sat us before the waitress even acknowledged that we were there. She walked by us 3 times before that. She took our drink order and that took 10 mins just to get our drinks, another 15 mins goes by and she returns to take our order. 25 mins later our food comes out. My husbands plate you could look at the pasta and tell it had been sitting in the window for way to long. The waitress then came back 10 mins later and asked if we were okay, I asked does this pasta come with any garlic bread or anything? she says NO and walks away. REALLY!!! When we were done eating it took 15 mins for the waitress to even notice that we were done. Literally sat there with my husbands plate empty. When she finally came over I asked for a box, another 6 mins for a damn box!! Sent the check with my card and we wait again!! The waitress is off chatting with her co-workers and other parties. 12 mins later she decides to bring me my card and the receipt.

We arrived at 3pm and were seated immediately. There were about 10 other tables being occupied when we got there so it wasn't busy by any means. We waited 10 mins to get a drink order. Another 10 to get our drinks and order our food. One entree came out before the appetizer so my sister was forced to eat her food first. By the time the appetizer came out she was already done and she's a pretty slow eater. Then almost immediately the rest of the entrees came out which was annoying. That's when we stopped getting service. No refills, no one asked how the food was ( it was only ok). It took forever to get the check so we could finally get the hell out of there.

136,Sheena B.,"Orange County, CA",7,29,7.0,1.0,2015-10-07,"WOW. I don't even know to begin with the WORST SERVICE I've ever gotten ANYWHERE. Even worse than any Asian restaurants I've ever been to & we all know most Asian restaurants don't have the best service out there. This rating is more for a particular server (not gonna name any names). It's not the restaurant itself cuz I like their food. It's the guy they hired to be serving people. If I could give him a big fat zero star, I would. So we came here for lunch with my parents & their guest visiting from Vietnam. They wanted him to try American food & my mom was bragging to him how American restaurants have way better customer service than Vietnamese restaurants. On this particular visit, service was mediocre at best up until he brought back the bill AFTER we paid then it just got worse from there. The bill was $103 something so we put in $104 cash. This foo brought back the bill pointing out to me that the bill was $103 & there was ONLY $104 in there. Then he proceeded to point out the suggested tip amount options at the bottom. I was thinking ""oh hell to the no did he just do that."" Some of us were still finishing up. We weren't even done eating yet. We usually don't leave the tip until we're about ready to leave. The minimum suggested tip was $15 but I told my mom to leave $10 or less cuz that was the TACKIEST shit I've ever experienced anywhere. He's lucky he even got more than a penny let alone $10 for that. Oh, and it gets better. After we walked out the door, he ran after us asking if everything was alright. I didn't wanna start anything in front of my parents & their guest so I just told him yea it was ok. But his ass kept pushing by asking the same question over again & again. I can see on his dumb face that he was talking about the tip. So I got pissed & told him straight out, ""is this about the tip because if it is, you're lucky you're even getting ANY tip  for what you did in there cuz that was the TACKIEST thing I've ever seen."" He even had the nerve to ask if ""service was good up til then."" Even after I told him it was ok (even though it wasn't the best since oh u know he brought out 6 water with 2 straws, made us wait forever to see his face to ask for extra straws, taking our plates before asking us if we were finished which i did not realized my mac & cheese diaappeared after he had already taken it. And the whole time, I can hear the forced friendliness coming from his mouth even though his facial expressions gave his fakeness away. So yes it was mediocre service at best). His ass went back inside with no apology or anything after I explained to him why he got a low tip. I had to make my parents & their guest leave before I can go back inside to speak with the manager about what just happened. I was SOOOOOO pissed off to the point I was shaking. The manager was super apologetic about it. He asked for my info so they can send me stuff & but honestly I only wanted to let them know this is the kind of person they have working for them in serving their guests. And I'll never be back to this location again anyways as long as that guy is still working there. Who the fuck in their right mind does that in first place. Running after somebody for a tip. Tipping isn't even a regular thing in some countries. I get tips at my job  too so I get it, some of us live off our tips so I always tip well when it's DESERVED. I'm never comfortable even telling my guests that the credit card machine is gonna ask them if they wanna leave a tip. I usually just explain to them that it's gonna ask them a few questions before they can swipe their card. Yes, it sucks once in a while when u get a low tip or no tip but NEVER have I ever point out to anyone that they HAVE to tip nor ever have I ran after anybody for a tip like this idiot did. Ugh that shit made me sooooo mad. TACKY, TACKY,  TACKY!!!

The waitress was super nice and helped me earn my stripes even though I didn't have the card with me. LAST TIME, our table of 3 ordered the bottomless appetizers at $10 per person. We were all ready to take advantage of this, what seemed to be, awesome deal and ask the waitress to keep it coming, with expectations that the food would be good (or at least edible). Too bad they cut out the tacos from the endless app menu. We had to settle for the ""loaded"" potato skins minus the bacon, mozerella sticks, and boneless chicken wing things. Now for the chicken, they came in about 10 different flavors and we were told that you could swap out flavors any time. So we thought, ""Cool. Let's do this."" At first, she dropped off a plate of skins WITH bacon and didn't bother to stay for a second so I had to call her back and wait for her to bring another. When they finally came, they were DAMN GREASY! No other way to describe it. There was so much oil in the thing that it was, like, translucent. All it was was carved out pieces of unsalted frozen potato wedges with a square of disgusting, not even melted orange cheese on each. I know the request was without bacon, but that's because we had a vegetarian on the table who I planned to share with. They could've accommodated us by throwing on some green onions or at least some seasoning! About 6 came on the plate with a tiny sour cream cup to dip (so about 2 tablespoons of it). The mozerella sticks were disgusting. The cheese inside tasted like nothing and got stuck in our throats. They served it with a tiny cup of, I think, marinara sauce that was super overpowering. We chose buffalo for the flavor of our first batch of boneless chicken wings and it was not good at all and very much like frozen Tyson Anytizers. We were already expecting them to have plain chicken at hand to toss in sauce to order but, c'mon. They didn't even cook it with the sauce, which made the flavor and smell so acidic and vinegary. We requested for a bigger dipping cup of ranch to stomach it since the little 2 tablespoon cup did not suffice and she said she couldn't do that for us but promised to bring out more of those little dipping sauce containers. Our next batch of wings were BBQ flavor and AGAIN the sauce was not cooked with the chicken. With this one, we couldn't stand the smell. And where were those extra sauces we asked for? At this point, we were gasping for air and didn't have any water. Our waitress was nowhere in sight and it was a weekday with only about 15 other patrons beside us or less. We ended up eating a total of half a plate of skins, 1 plate of mozerella sticks, and 1 batch of wings and leaving without an appetite -not good! Big waste of our money.

Arrived at 1pm for lunch and was greeted by a sullen hostess.  Once seated we waited to be greeted by our waiter, Austin.  When he came around my requested glass of water with lemon---it  was sans lemon.  Husband orders your endless apps and I ask for a few more minutes to decide.  Waiter shows up after 10 minutes.  Takes order.  LONG wait.  Get the French Dip which has rock hard bread and cold insides.  Ask politely if I can get something hot.  Hear Austin the waiter yelling at chef.  It's now been 45 minutes.  At an hour mark I get my entree which is now hot but the bread is pasty white and not toasted.  (I guess you can have it rock hard or totally cold.)  Opted for cole slaw which has not been dressed or seasoned.  Yuck. Austin is more annoyed than apologetic and nothing is offered for the over hour wait for a sandwich and a cold order.  I'd really appreciate a response back.

207,Vincent T.,"Cupertino, CA",268,4,21.0,5.0,2016-03-20,"I must say it was a wonderful experience eating here. I actually was here for dinner yesterday on Saturday 3/19/16. I was here with my dad. We ordered the Jack Daniel Sampler from the appetizer menu. The Baby back ribs were spot on and was delicious to eat with the signature bbq sauce that came with it. The chicken it came with was also really great along with the fried shrimp. The bbq sauce the whole platter came with is probably the best one had so far out of all the ones ive had. Now call me a pig on this one, but i have a good reason to why i did it. There is the Friday's Endless Apps promotion going on which is where you pay $12 for all the unlimited appetizers you want. Of course, that comes with limitations. There are only 9 different appetizers on the Endless's apps menu. You probably can't handle all of them without a few friends (unless youre me.) Oh yeah, and the good reason to why i decided to do this is that i was hungry. Anyway, the way it works is that you eat your first dish, then when youre finished, you order another one, and so on until you're full. We started with the Tucson spinach dip. Now im a bit of a finicky eater and i dont like onions, but the ones in the spinach dip were ground up into a really fine invisible powder thats mixed into the dip. Therefore, i was able to eat it much to my delight. I will say, its better than most spinach dips in that the dip is easier to scoop onto the tortilla chips that come with it. By taste, it tastes slightly better than the one at Dave & Busters and a few other places. Its a bit hard to describe, the only word i could find for it was ""delicious."" The next thing i got was the mozzarella sticks. I will admit, they were good to eat, but ive had better. Thats my opinion though. Again, im a finicky eater so other people would enjoy it more than me. However to make them more enjoyable, instead of dipping them in the default marinara sauce, use the delicious Jack Daniel Signature BBQ sauce. Makes everything better. The next appetizer we received was the BBQ Chicken Tostada. These are mini round tortilla chips with shredded cabbage and chicken on them. Very delicious. The bbq sauce it came with was very delicious. Im fact, it was the same Jack Daniel signature bbq i just mentioned seconds ago. Note: the tostadas have a dab of mayo on them. This dish was bomb. (The good kind) the next dish was the potstickers. I think these were pork. Anyway, ive had these before at the ""Block at Orange"" location near to Dave and Busters, and they were much more appealing there, but the ones here were good too. The sauce is good too. Unfortunately, it was not the Jack Daniel Sig BBQ, but hey. You can still try. Now by this time, i started to get full. I ordered the last appetizer which was the baked potato skins. Now i dont bother with the sour cream and onion, but i ate these with the JD Sig BBQ sauce and it was very VERY good. The tostadas were good too. These have bacon and cheese on them like most other places, but they taste way better. Especially with the Jack Daniel Signature BBQ sauce.  So lets talk service. BEST SERVICE IVE HAD SINCE never. Our server's name was Jeremy and he was very polite, enthusiastic, informative. He's a very cool chill guy, makes you feel comfortable and right at home. He checked up on us more than a few times which is excellent service by my standards. All the other servers from other restaurants take 15-20 minutes and only check on you twice. He also brought all the food out much faster than my temper under 5 minutes. Basically, once i finished one of my appetizers, i would basically receive a new one within a split second. If you eat giant plates of food within 5 minutes, this guy is the one for you. If you take 5 hours to eat a lollipop, you best find another restaurant with the nonexistent service. So yes, Jeremy is a wonderful server. Very nice.  Also we came around 7:30 which is a good time if you want it to not be packed with people and faster service. (Although Jeremy is probably fast either way) So i will say, this is my longest review so far and it's very rare i review a place unless its very good. Good job TGI for choosing the location at Westminster mall, very convenient to find food. Much better than the food court. (But the food court is good too. Try Fuji Japan if you like teriyaki)  Have a nice day folks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westminster?start=160,3.04,2.64,2.64,3.3160000000000003,2.8000000000000003

When our server came by i had ordered the chicken and shrimp cajun pasta and she ordered the pizza, for appetizers we ordered crab cakes. After a while we started to realize that they were taking quite long with our order and there were only about 5 other people in the restaurant at this time. Finally our food came out about 40 minutes later. Thats a pretty long time if you ask me. I began eating my pasta, it was quite delicious, so i took in fact the time it mustve taken to make this. After we finished eating, we paid the bill and left. I brought my leftovers with me. When we arrived home i started to feel uneasy a little, and i develpoed a few itchy bumps on my face that started to swell as i scratched them. Soon these bumps began to appear on my whole body, and i went into shock. My body was starting to feel like it was on fire, and then at times is get really bad cold chills. I started to feel light headed with a sensation that i might faint. When my mom came home she asked how i got this and i mentioned what i had eaten, telling her about the pasta. She asked me if it had shrimp in it and i said yes. Right then she knew that what gave me this horrible reaction was the shrimp. Im not allergic to shrimp whatsoever, but she said that the reason why i was in that condition was because of the shrimp. She had had the same experience at another restaurant. This is due to the lack of cleanliness of the shrimp. In other words, the shrimp was not cleaned of its defecations. So tgif heres some advice, clean your damn shellfish.

221,Elsa T.,"Westminster, CA",0,14,,1.0,2016-09-22,"We came here for my birthday dinner. It was 6 adults and 3 kids. We get there and it wasn't very busy. Our server comes, says hello and then walks off. Comes back about 10 minutes later to take our order for drinks. Leaves and about 10 minutes later comes back to give us our drinks. He leaves again. I don't even know how much time went by when he finally comes back. He apologizes since he has another big party. He takes our order and walks away. After some time, 2 other workers bring our food. They don't even know what the orders are. But we figure it out but they brought everyone's food except for MY meal. So we tell them I still need mine and they say they'll go check on it. They leave and no one comes back for about 15 minutes. So finally my father in law gets up, goes to the front to ask for a manager since we don't know where our server is. He talks to a manager and the manager just tells him ok, that they'll get my meal out and I can have any dessert I want. Another 15 minutes go by. At this point, everyone I'm there with to celebrate my birthday is done with their meal!!! So my father in law gets up again and find our server. He tells the server that I still haven't gotten my food. He says sorry and he'll get it out. And guess what, they STILL don't get it out to me. My father in law has to get up a third time. At this point we're all upset and I'm starving! Finally after another 10 minutes or so, my food finally comes out. The manager come to the table and just says ""Oh ok. You got your food."" Shouldn't she have come out and checked 45 minutes ago when we talked to you the first time?!?!? She asks ""What dessert would you like?"" She's not even polite and doesn't offer an apology at this point. I finish my meal and they bring my dessert, sing and leave. Everyone at our table, including my kids, are just annoyed at this point. It was just very frustrating having to wait so long especially when we were celebrating my birthday, for my food. After the employees sing and leave, the manager stands there and finally offers an apology. But it wasn't even a real apology. She's looking up at the ceiling, and you can tell she's trying to remember what to say. It sounded so scripted. And what was very upsetting to was that she was blaming the server only. She took no responsibility. Yes, the server could have told someone to cover if he was having a hard time with the other party. But she is the manager! She should be out there making sure the restaurant is running smoothly and if you see your server is busy with one party, help him with his other table. She was being lazy. She knew we were waiting on a plate and didn't make sure it was sent to us. Anyway, they didn't charge us for our dinner but still. The whole thing was so annoying.

I arrived, and they got two items wrong, which was slightly expected for how large the order was. Then they got another item wrong again when they were almost done making the food. Then again. At this point, I thought it was ridiculous. As for the food, the side dishes were literally in a tiny white container that was half the size of other TGIF's. We were very disappointed. For the main entrees, the way they packed our order led to many of the juices dripping out of the containers into the bag, which made the containers soaked along with the packages of utensils.

I didn't want to believe it but I'm pretty sure it's true. My dad ordered a steak that he said tasted like a foot ball...chewy and no flavor. I ordered a chicken sandwich that tasted OK. (I only ate half) All of our entrees came out at the same time with no silverware. Shortly after we received the entrees the appetizer came out. Shouldn't an appetizer come out before the entrees? Then we sat and looked at our food for at least 10 minutes with no silverware. We asked 3 different people for silverware and finally someone brought us some. Just overall not a great experience.

314,Brian D.,"Irvine, CA",65,13,1.0,1.0,2017-02-14,"It's my fault for getting my expectations up. This place is essentially a happy hour burger joint. I should have come for a burger and I'd probably be thrilled, but in my infinite wisdom I opted for the steak and lobster with sweet potato fries and mac and cheese as sides.  It arrived on a plate for grown ups which only served to emphasize the lack of fries, and the children's portions of steak and lobster.  The steak was small enough it would take 3 more to equal the patty of a grown up burger.  The lobster was so small it made me regret choices I've made in my life that led me to this moment. The sides looked ok, but I could count the number of fries on both hands.  The sides tasted fine (it's hard to screw up mac n cheese unless you're BWW) but the steak... actually let's call it what is, a thick slider. The slider should have been medium rare, but came medium well, and was oddly flavorless on one side. I've never known beef to be devoid of flavor, but somehow they managed to remove it. Well half of it anyway. The lobster was about the size of a couple chicken fingers, tasted more like crab than lobster, and clung to its shell in a way that would make crab jealous.  This alone might make me vegetarian. The saving grace was my server Denise who was great and would get 5 stars if this was just for her.  I should have gotten a burger, or drunk.

They have happy hour after 9PM which includes half-off appetizers and cheaper alcoholic beverages. We came in on a Sunday night, and there wasn't anybody to seat us. I think there were only 3 waiters including 1 at the bar, and no host or hostess. We waited in the lobby until one of the shift leads noticed us. We sat down and the waiter got our drink orders. They said they would come back and take our food orders right away but I guess they meant in another 20 minutes. Once we placed our orders, the food took awhile to come out.  We ordered from the happy hour menu which included potato skins, Jack Daniel traditional wings, Chicken nachos, sesame jack strips, hamburger sliders, and spicy fried chicken sliders (new). The traditional Jack Daniel wings was good and meaty but it was lacking sauce. We asked for more Jack Daniel sauce and refills for water. They came back with the refills and forgot the sauce. The potato skins were crispy and delicious, however, the chicken nachos didn't seem fresh; the guacamole seemed like it has been out for awhile. And the sliders were okay; the spicy chicken was full of flavor while the hamburger one was dry and plain. The sesame jack strips are usually really good here, but today, I didn't taste that much meat and more of the flour. We got the bill and they charged us for the extra Jack Daniel sauce which they never told us they would. Once we gave them our card to process the payment, it was such a long wait to get the card back. I saw our waiter actually setting up tables with utensils rather than processing our card.  Overall, the food is okay. I felt like the food was rushed to come out that it wasn't as fresh as it could be. Great service is not something to expect at this location especially when it's NOT busy.

We immediately get seated and wait. And wait. And wait. 10 minutes after sitting down, a server swoops by saying ""I'll be with you in a minute"". So we wait, wait, wait and wait some more. About 20 minutes of waiting was enough. No drinks, no orders taken, no kiss my ass, nothing. We got up and started to leave. One of the hostesses apologized up and down and sat us at another table. We notice the server for this section take notice of us. We wait. And wait. And wait some more. After nearly 10 minutes, again without ANY server contact, we get up to leave. I'm kinda pissed at this point and ask for a manager. Yet another 5 or so minutes pass and this sloppily dressed guy comes out, listens to me tell him about the service and he could not have cared less. We left.

We ordered: - The sampler: the fried shrimp was super yummy, the ribs were very good and tender. The chicken nuggets - well, they weren't so good; too much breading, I felt like I was eating toasted bread. The sauce it all came with wasn't good either.  - Traditional chicken wings with buffalo sauce: It was good and meaty. The sauce needed more flavor and spice.  - Chicken and shrimp pasta:  This dish didn't do a lot for me, but my brother loved it. - Sizzling chicken and shrimp with mashed potatoes: Very good; filling, and flavorful.  My favorite dish of the evening.

The food is amazing and the only problem I have is that it might take some time to get a waiter or waitress to come and take your order. Service is also a slow.  Also, it takes time to get your food.  I constantly have to try to flag down a server but it's hard when they don't come pass you a lot.  I know it's big but like Anais H. said in her review, it wasn't crowded, so no excuse.   Anyways, I don't like the service here.  Too bad, because if the service was better I would definitely come here more often.  As for now, I don't think I will.  I would most likely go somewhere I  will be served better and not have to constantly try to get the server's attention.  Sometimes, when the wait is way too long I make an excuse from the table and go find a server and tell them I need to be waited on.  Hey if you had to wait for 20 or more minutes for food or getting your order taken, what would you do?  I normally would leave but when you are with an elderly person that doesn't want to walk, it's hard to do that.   My advice to your manager is to make sure you are checking with your customers and making sure they are happy and train your servers to check up on their customers once in a while and get their order and food on the table as fast as they can.  If there is a problem or it's taking longer than it should, the server should come back to the table and just let the customer know you are still working on the food and it will be there soon.  Offer free bread or refill their drinks.  Do something to show that the customer is important.  Or they might just walk out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westminster,2.92,2.59,2.552,,2.7219999999999995

316,Matthew S.,"Stanton, CA",61,3,,1.0,2017-11-18,This used to be a great place to go for food and drinks. They raised the price of the endless apps to $15 and it's only 5 different apps now. And I didn't even get endless apps because the wait time in between the apps was so long I lost my appetite. They changed the menu and dropped a lot of things. The waiter was not very good. The wait time for food was just stupidly long. I think this is the last time we will be coming here for a very long time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westminster?start=20,2.64,2.45,2.58,,2.5260000000000002
320,Serena W.,"Fullerton, CA",0,3,,2.0,2017-11-20,"Despite the great food service was rude. I was with my boyfriend and got attitude and looked up and down from a host i tried to catch the name I believe it started with an A, she had no shame in being obvious with dirty looks and said nothing when seating us. The server Mckenna took forever and was sarcastic when my boyfriend asked opinions on the food of what to get. Because of that I asked to speak to a manager and she never got him or her just avoided it. I normally go to the Orange location but thought I would try out this location but after being repeatedly rude to I rather not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westminster?start=20,2.52,2.46,2.584,,2.484

312,Kerry L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",9,7,,1.0,2017-11-23,"If I could leave 0 Stars I would.This place is a waste of time.Came here with my husband for date night last night Thanksgiving eve. We got there around 830. There were about 5 tables having dinner at the time. First when we walked through the door, there was no one there to greet us. Ok! So we stood there for about 5-6 minutes wondering why no one acknowledged us despite several servers and a bartender milling around. Finally the hosts comes out and seats us. Our server McKenna was sweet but very young . She seemed somewhat knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered our drinks .My husband just wanted water. I ordered the ultimate margarita .Mckenna brought the water for my husband promptly , however, I continued to sit drinkless for more then 20 minutes. Twice McKenna informed us that ""she was still working on the margarita"" Still working on it .. the place was dead. Finally I got the margarita only to have to send it back. It was terrible. It tasted like pure mix. I am not one to send things back, but after waiting 20 minutes .... it was that awful. As I sent the margarita back, I ordered a Cab to drink with dinner.... again waited and waited and waited . Our dinners came out. I had the rib eye with lemon butter broccoli and the hubbs has sirloin and Lobster . The food was good... but something was missing .... The glass of cab I had ordered. The cab finally came out when I was completely done with my dinner. I was going to send it back again but damn I was thirsty . Not once was I offered a glass of water or anything while i was waiting for the bartender to pour my drink (not sure what she was doing ...the place was practically empty) . At this point we asked for the manager ...My husband also asked for the menu to order more food because I had just gotten my wine, McKenna was flustered and didn't even hear him . Again we waited and waited and waited some more for the manager to come speak to us.McKenna was apologetic, but at this point we wanted our bill. We were done. Still no manager , our bill was paid, I was seeing red. I asked the gentleman who originally sat us to speak with the manager. 2 minutes later the manager comes out. I didn't catch her name , but clearly was not interested in talking to us . She kept calling us ""ladies and gentleman "" She was definitely awkward. The manager claimed that the kitchen was short staffed... really the problem wasn't the kitchen.. it was the bartender and managements lack of effort to rectify anything . Seeing that we weren't getting anywhere with management we left and we won't be back. We didn't want anything taken off our bill, we didn't want free desert or free appetizers, we wanted to have an enjoyable dinner and this just wasn't. Save your energy folks and go somewhere else",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westminster?start=20,2.24,2.43,2.58,,2.3540000000000005
1,son d.,"Westminster, CA",61,181,17.0,1.0,2017-12-03,"Called in to order their advertised special, a full rack of big ribs for $12.99.  The guy wasn't aware of their special despite being advertised on TV and on their home page.  He said they had two entrees and two sides for $14.99, which I thought was dirt cheap, so I ordered two orders of ribs with a side loaded mashed potatoes and onion rings. My friend went to pick up the order and he calls me and says, ""they only have one order"".  I replied, ""the guy said it was two entrees, it's okay, we'll get split it"".  So he comes back with a full rack of ribs and regular mashed potatoes and soggy onion rings. I go to look up their specials and it was a choice of two meat/seafood options and two sides.  Friend said the hostess was rude AF about the mixup. A week later, tried to order their special again.  Asked the girl for 3 full racks of ribs and mentioned the special on their website, which she was clueless about.  She tells me that special is expired.  She has to ask her manager if they will honor their advertised special, wtf (btw, the special is still on their homepage two weeks later).   So I order 3 racks of ribs with loaded mashed potatoes and fries.  I ask for the total and she says it's $60, in which I reply, ""3 times 13 plus tax should be in the low 40's"".  They were trying to charge me $20 for some bacon and cheddar cheese on my mashed potatoes? This location is one of the worst in terms of customer service.  I can see why it's always so dead there. *Been trying to use their online ordering site for over a month now and it still doesn't work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westminster,2.12,2.43,2.58,,2.3060000000000005
11,Rosie K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",44,39,27.0,1.0,2017-12-08,"This is probably the least interesting place that one will ever eat at. Westminster Mall does not have a lot of interesting food choices, but Westminster/Huntington Beach in general does have amazing food. Do yourself a favor, leave the mall, and drive a few minutes down Bolsa or up Beach to get some delicious Vietnamese/Lebanese/Mexican/Chinese/Thai/Japanese/Italian/French/Persian/German/Indian food. Skip this dump. My friend and I arrived at about 6:30 PM, we were greeted kindly and told that happy hour was until 7 pm. Our server was super sweet, checking on us and refilling our water glasses and lemonade. But, the food was disgusting. I ordered a French onion soup, and a side salad, and my companion ordered some cheesecake. My salad consisted of limp lettuce, some shredded cheese, two tiny cherry tomatoes, and three croutons. The tables had no silverware. Our food was flavorless and boring. This particular location has touchscreen iPads, which would be great if they actually were functional. Our credit cards were not working when we tried to pay so we asked the server to help us out, which was fine. But what is the point of having such technology when it is useless? And forget about going there with old people; I am tech savvy and great with swiping. My companion can barely see, so I handled the payment stuff. I cannot imagine elderly people/grandparents/blind folks eating here and dealing with non functional iPads. I will say that the onion rings are delicious, but we were not served the supposedly stellar barbecue dipping sauce that is supposed to come with them. My friend had a slice of cheesecake that looked tiny and boring. She didn't even finish it. It was nearly $8! We would have been better off driving to Cheesecake Factory down the road. Our meal was overpriced and crappy. But the staff is nice. My stomach is hurting a few hours later. Two thumbs down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westminster,2.04,2.4,2.58,,2.2560000000000002

Funny that not how I asked for it to be cooked. The server took the burger back. I ordered a salad; it's been over 20 min. for a salad. Why did I try this place again WHY!!
