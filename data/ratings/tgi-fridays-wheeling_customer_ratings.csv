46,Pavlo C.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",9,4,,2.0,2012-04-28,Ordered two chicken sandviches to go and got two cheeseburgers It was unpleasant surprise for me when i opened boxes at home. Order waiting time - 20 minutes. When I called manager - she answered that I was supposed to check my order as if it was my fault that I got two cheeseburgers instead of chicken sandviches. My impresssion is that they treat customers like a trash and then if somebody is calling - gift card can fix the problem. I did not want their gift card since I am not going to visit them anymore.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wheeling?start=40,2.536,2.536,2.536,2.536,2.536

My only complaint about this chain is that even though their menu is huge, it always seems hard to find anything you actually want. This may just be me, but even the family seems to have problems figuring out what to eat every time we come here.  The Jack Daniels grilled items are the best things on the menu.

55,Courtney Y.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",0,12,,1.0,2013-04-17,"I went to this location on my 21st birthday to get some food in my two girlfriends and I and the food was okay. We sat in the bar and the service was decent.. that was until we left our tip and paid our bill and then went to the bathroom to find out that when we were done the waitress isn't pleased with her 20% tip and asks us if we were also going to tip the bartender as well (we weren't sitting at the bar). So we walk out to see the waitress following us out telling us she has a three year of son she needs to take care of and calling us ""21 year old s*$ts"" and to never come back again. Her co worker also came outside and yelled to us that if we had anything to say to come over and say it to her face... Never in my life have I seem such immaturity and disgusting behavior especially in the work place while people were there dining as well. When I talked to the manager the first time she didn't seem to concerned and neither did the big boss or owner. I received a $30 money card for their chain and went back to see if actions had been implemented. Unfortunately the waitress apart of this ordeal was still waiting and staring me and my boyfriend down. I don't think I can ever go back to one of their restaurants knowing they support such disgusting behavior. It was the most horrible dining experience I've ever had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wheeling?start=40,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436

43,Joseph P.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",30,471,1434.0,4.0,2013-07-07,"I've been coming here since the doors opened a few years back, partly because it is so close.  It is one of the better locations, and the staff is particularly good here.  Management seems to be hands on - in a good way.  Our favorites are Chicken & Shrimp Pasta, the Ruben sandwich, and Bruchetta Chicken pasta.    Sure, they are part of a large chain, but what sets them apart is that they constantly revise the menu, sometimes exploring into truly creative areas.  The down side is that sometimes great items don't sell well to the ""great unwashed"", and they get discontinued.  I fondly remember a light Pecan-crusted Chicken with tortellini dish served with a salad of grape tomatoes and fresh mozzarella - for under 10 bucks.  The sauce was superb, but it didn't sell well enough and was gone.  Even the Fajitas, which were better than most Mexican places around serve, were canned a few years back.  They were a nice option and I miss them.  Still, I admire the occasional bursts of creativity in the menu and the staff at this location is genuinely nice and always competent. The drinks are often  pricey - the wine list is generally overpriced - a glass of Barefoot brand Chardonnay costs as much as a full bottle at retail.  However, they do run ongoing drink specials if you are open minded.

49,Iris G.,"Wheeling, IL",30,7,,1.0,2014-07-11,We were there on a Friday night.  Since there was a wait we sat in the bar. It was lousy with too  loud music and people yelling at the sports on the televisions.  Waiter finally came over after 10 minute and gave us menus.   10 minutes later asked what we wanted to drink.  We ordered soft drinks. Then the waiter proceeded to go behind the bat nd wait on people sitting at the bar.  Guess we weren't important sine we didn't order alcohol.  So we got up and left. Then the host asked how everything was and we told him that we did not get served and were leaving.  The kid looked like a deer in the headlights.  Take my advice and do not visit TGIF Fridays on a Friday unless you like waiting and LOTS of noise,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wheeling?start=40,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34

She only realizes there are many options after I ask several questions. She wasn't happy.   I order French onion soup as I haven't had that in a long time - me incorrectly thinking it is the crock bubbly kind.  A bowl of Luke warm soup with a cheese covered crouton arrives.  So send back for temp but thinking that the bowl placed in front of me is no way worth 6 bucks.  30 seconds after the soup goes back the dinners arrive. Well at least I now can tell them to forget that crummy soup.  Oh forgot. I ordered a large beer.  10 minutes later I'm told they are out of what I ordered - reordered and took another 15 minutes to get my beer with a 3+ inch head.

First off, we waited too long to be seated considering the restaurant was slow and 3/4 of the tables were open. We ordered our food and drinks and waited. Drinks came out, soda was FLAT! It was gross. I ordered a strawberry lemonade for my son and it took about 15 minutes longer than the other drinks. He's only 4 so of course he whined and complained until it finally came. Then we waited for the food. And we waited and waited. Then, we waited some more. It seemed the food was never going to come. My kids were starving! Whining and complaining.... We ordered chicken strips and fries for them, I ordered nachos and my husband a pasta dish, really nothing that should have taken close to an hour, but it did. When the food finally came, the server was ver apologetic and told us a manager was going to come and speak to us. The food was crap. My kids fries were dry and bland, possibly recooked because they were empty and dry inside and also not seasoned at all. They completely forgot to salt the fries!!! My nachos were stone cold. COLD. If you've never had cold nachos, don't. My husbands pasta was also cold. We ate the food because at this point it was 2pm and we were ravished, not going to send it back and wait longer. Then, the manager came around but he did not visit us or apologize, he did however comp the couple next to us who had the same experience. That was even more upsetting, not only do I have children with me who are vocal about their displeasure, but I also complained to the serve and I feel if other people were comped we should have been also, not only did we wait just as long but our food was cold and unseasoned!! We reluctantly paid the $60 bill. I'll never visit another Friday's again, this experience ruined it for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wheeling,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76

Like similar restaurants -- Applebees, Chilis, Bahama Breeze, Fox and Hound, etc. they provide a wide assortment of options on their menu at a reasonable price, but the execution of these dishes varies widely. On my last visit, I tried a very of different appetizers including loaded potatoes, boneless wings, warm pretzels, mozzarella sticks, and crispy green bean fries. Overall, the food was alright -- food temperature was good, but there was nothing that stood out in terms of texture or flavor combinations. The different items dependent a lot on sauce and seasonings for flavor as nothing stood out about the quality of ingredients that were used.

I noticed she was very friendly and courteous to other tables around us.  Thank you for the delicious meal! We will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wheeling,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
7,JAM T.,"Chicago, IL",35,16,59.0,4.0,2017-03-21,"Thank God TGIF was open late. Otherwise, my family would have starved! But seriously, there weren't many choices at this time of night for a family dinner. My daughter's talent show ended well passed 9pm and we were quite hungry. Our food were excellent! I'd recommend the grilled salmon, chicken pasta, and a bottomless app! We even had a free dessert and chips because of my points! Can't beat that!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wheeling,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

5,Cathy G.,"McHenry, IL",36,1,,1.0,2017-11-09,"I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, for delivery, well done. When the burger was received it was practically raw and unable to be eaten. Fries were cold and condiments requested were not included. I am pretty disappointed. Will not be ordering from this restaurant ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wheeling,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
4,Jim L.,"Wheeling, IL",0,17,5.0,1.0,2017-11-25,They told us to wait for 15-20 minutes. There have 6-8 tables available. We waited almost 30 minutes. Plus any steaks must have broccoli. I don't like to have broccoli. I asked for sub. She said that I'll have to pay extra Ugh,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wheeling,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
1,Bob C.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",39,8,,1.0,2017-12-29,"Restaurant not busy at all, waited at least 5 minutes for server, when we ordered I asked for a turkey burger with pepper jack cheese, Matt the server wasn't sure if they had it, I told him if they didn't then American would do, I also asked him if we got salsa and chips since we were stripes members. Food came out in timely manner, chips and salsa never came, he asked if we still wanted them, we declined. My turkey burger had Monterey Jack, they said since they didn't have pepper jack they just put Monterey Jack, also fries had way too much seasoning on them. Whatever, I'll just eat this. When we finished we waited about 15 minutes for Matt to come by so we could get a Togo box and the check, he took our card, then proceeded to run food and stuff for at least 10 minutes until he finally came back with check.  Usually food and service is good here, don't know what happened.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wheeling,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
