33,Chance S.,"Orlando, FL",10,96,2.0,4.0,2012-03-22,"First, I will say that most people I know do not like this place. But I am usually not disappointed when I go there. One reason could be is that I always go to the bar, so I never have to wait for service. The other people I know complain about the service they get at tables. For appetizers I like the pot stickers and spinach dip. For the main meal I like the cajun chicken pasta and the Captain Morgan Caribbean Chicken sandwich. Seriousy, that chicken sandwich is so darn good! The value here is very reasonable. Right now you get to choose one appetizer and one main meal for $10-$15. I think they also have one of the best mojitos in town, but it is a little expensive. I guess my advice to you is, if you require a lot of attention at a restaurant then maybe this is not the place to go to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita?start=20,2.192,2.192,2.192,2.192,2.192

It took all 4 of us about 30 to find anything Ty easy that even sounded halfway appealing. I ended up with the pick 3 a nd share appetizers. It was awful!

My wife and I were visiting from out of town this weekend and wanted to come here, because we haven't been for awhile. We walked in and were greeted lead to a high table, requested a booth and got one. We looked through the menu and decided what we wanted and waited, and waited. Neither a waiter or waitress came by and said anything to us, like welcome to TGI Fridays, my name is so and so or anything. They didn't even walk by and say be with you in a minute. We were completely ignored by both a waiter and waitress (who kept walking by and scowling at us). After 15 minutes of nothing, we got up and walked out. Someone who I believe was the asst manager thanked us for coming and asked how are food was. I told him that we sat for 15 minutes and no one came by. He wanted to give us a free appetizer card, talk about a slap in the face. I've been in this particular Fridays before, without any problems. I don't what has changed, I may or may not be back.

26,Ava M.,"Andover, KS",1,9,,2.0,2015-10-27,Not worth the money.  The average entree price for TGI Fridays is $20.00.  We got the Jack Daniels entrees.  I had the rib eye which came out cold and the sauce was poured over the steak which in turn the sides that i had ordered came in soaked in the sauce.  My husband ordered the steak and shrimp for $27 and the entree didn't come with any shrimp.  The extra charge for a side salad with entree and the kids meals are more expensive than any other chain restaurant in Wichita.  I will not be back again and I would not recommend this restaurant to any body.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita?start=20,,,,,

18,Majeedah B.,"San Diego, CA",0,23,4.0,1.0,2016-06-27,This place has really went downhill in the past few years. Totally empty on a Friday which was surprising for a summer evening at TGI Fridays. Service was slow. Server did her best though she seemed overworked. Food was overpriced and basic. We could've went to Applebee's because the food quality was probably even lower than theirs. My grandpa paid nearly $20 for the salmon that my 6 year old nephew could easily devour. My dad's chicken looked like it came from a TV dinner. Mashed potatoes tasted instant and super dry. Sweet potato fries and strawberry lemonade were the only joy. And to think this was for my little brother's birthday and his first time there. He wasn't impressed.

I ordered the grilled chicken with shrimp and cheesy mashed potatoes. Chicken and mashed potatoes were delicious, wasn't a fan of the sauce they put on the shrimp. The entree came with what seemed like 2 servings of mashed potatoes so that was awesome. Wednesday's are $3 Martini nights, so I ordered an extra dirty martini (add olive juice) and it wasn't dirty enough.  I let our server know who was also the bartender, and he brought me an extra shot of olive juice- that was nice! We enjoy coming here but it can be a little on the pricey side. I suggest going when they have drink specials throughout the week and bring a coupon!

16,Courtney S.,"Wichita, KS",38,4,,1.0,2017-04-18,"First off let me say that in the past this restaurant was good but whomever they have in charge now needs to go. The wait staff was good but everything from the menu to the food quality was awful. Let's start with the 10.00 all you care to eat Apps...ok the fine print says..10.00 per person at the table. What?? I could see that, if you are going for a game and drinks but to pay that and also eat a meal is ridiculous. My sister ordered Salmon...which she does at tons of restaurants and it was the smallest piece of salmon in existence and it was burned black on the bottom. She sent it back and the second piece was cooked correctly but still half the size of any other restaurant in the city. Another problem was both the broccoli and spinach was flavorless. Also it took forever for them to re-cook it. So, she finally got her meal once we finished. My mother ordered Jack Daniel chicken and shrimp and the shrimp was good but the chicken was tough, stringy and small. They also gave her the wrong sides and had to fix that. I will just say this place has gone so far down hill there isn't anyway to convince me to ever return. One other thing...when an item is sent back, a manager usually comes out...apologizes and makes sure your satisfied..but we never even saw a manager. Crazy!! So, if you are looking for a great evening out, run as far away from this place as you can.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12

19,Theresa M.,"Wichita, KS",0,5,,1.0,2017-06-05,"So all I can say is DO NOT give this place a minute more of your time. Unbelievable! I came in with my family at 6 pm on Sunday Evening. We were one of about 5 tables. More customers followed. It took us 20 minutes to get someone to get our Water and Tea. You would think we would have left but we were tired and hungry. They finally took our order and then the staff disappeared! At the 45 minute mark we asked someone passing by us if they could check on our food. He then disappeared. Our waitress came out of the kitchen to tell us that our food was coming right out. No Food... another employee wandered by and volunteered to get the manager. No Manager. At One hour and 5 minutes we put cash on the table to pay for our Iced Tea and left. Our waitress came running out of the back to see what was happening. We told her that we would not be waiting any longer. She then YELLED at us to say we had ONLY been there 20 minutes and there were people before us. (Which, by the way, were not being served either)  It was NOT 20 minutes it had been over an hour. Very bad form to try and put off on a customer your EPIC Fail.

Sorry!) was very friendly and was eager to make sure our unlimited apps kept coming and were always hot. Our drinks never emptied, and there was always food in front of us. Plus, he stuck around for polite conversation when he definitely didn't have to.  In addition to this, the hostess working that night was also awesome, and made great friends with my daughter.
