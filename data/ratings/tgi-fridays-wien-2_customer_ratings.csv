20,Lavender L.,"Arlington, VA",4,231,,3.0,2013-03-29,"Hmm, a taste of the US. However, the menu is obviously slightly different catering toward the European tastes and the prices are higher. We had a great bilingual waiter. They did not charge for tap water! That was a pleasant surprise! Will return to try some other menu items. We just had a craving for the jack Daniel ribs and burgers. Sweet potato fries were okay, they are missing the accompanying sauce though. Drinks are pricey. No happy hour deals or stripes frequent customer program like in the US. That would be a nice touch..hint..hint..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wien-2?start=20,,,,,
11,Rory R.,"Vienna, Austria",26,287,1162.0,3.0,2013-05-01,As with most TGI Fridays you know what you're gonna get but in my experiences you get just a little bit less here. Which is a pity. Quite expensive too for the quality of food served. (Its good but not as great as at other TGI Fridays I've been to.) Decent cocktail selection. Large screens to watch sports and friendly and plentiful staff. Missing some touches but alright.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wien-2,,,,,
16,Alejandro A.,"Vienna, Austria",10,5,,3.0,2013-11-15,"I personally believe that TGI Fridays here in Vienna is VERY pricey compared to other TGI's in Europe, and the quality of the food is not even near to where it should be. Regardless,  the food is still good, the staff is always very friendly, and the atmosphere is superb!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wien-2,,,,,
17,Damon B.,"Vienna, Austria",37,305,902.0,5.0,2013-12-18,"WOW i never knew Friday's was such a nice place. This was my first time EVER to even go inside a Friday's and i was impressed just walking in the door. I really like the design and immediate injection of a great atmosphere i received after walking in the door. From the moment we walking in the door until we left again, we had impeccable and super friendly service, i really do love a place that knows the value of service. The food on the menu looked great, i really wanted to try everything, however this time i tried the BBQ Burger and i was not disappointed at all, what a great burger. I need to return there at least ten more times to get an better understanding of everything on the menu and to determin if Friday's is like this every time you go.  So wait for my updated review to know more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wien-2,,,,,
19,Bogdan R.,"Berlin, Germany",12,23,,4.0,2014-01-27,"It's expensive but I am a fan for years. Triple chicken sampler, a jack daniels burger and a brownie is all you need. Combine those those three and you are in heaven. The minus are the expensive drinks, the cocktail prices are a joke.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wien-2,,,,,
24,Pardeep M.,"Vienna, Austria",5,7,,3.0,2014-02-02,"It's not as American as it should be.  The food just isn't made the same nor tastes the same, and if you are American, then you will probably be let down.  The drinks are good, but overpriced.  It always seems to have a hefty crowd as it is a popular place, but somehow it is missing the real American feel to it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wien-2?start=20,,,,,
13,A H.,"Vienna, Austria",81,251,1071.0,2.0,2014-02-24,"My brother was craving for burgers, so we tried this American restaurant... Well, the food was good, the burger quite huge (for the greatest pleasure of my brother) and the staff was friendly enough.The interior decoration is quite funny, very ""tourist""-American. But we waited quite a while before getting a table, and once sitted we had to wait again (for ages!) before getting our orders (we got our plates more than an hour after entering the restaurant!). And it is so loud in there that waiting is quite a challenge really. About the food: don't go there if you want a salad. When I ordered one WITHOUT cheese... The waitress tried to convince me to get it WITH cheese. Quote : ""why not? it is with feta cheese, not normal cheese..."" ?!? Finally she told me that it wasn't possible to get this salad without it! Which made us wonder if their salad are fresh or if everything is pre-prepared? Again, we waited quite a while before getting our plates, but I had to wait double for I had to give my salad back : they ""forgot"" that I asked it without dressing on it. And apparently, getting a new already-prepared salad takes about half an hour to make... only to get a chicken almost completely carbonated. Plus, the ""mango"" in the salad was actually only stripes on it, kind of a puree really. :/ My recommendations:  - don't order a salad. - actually, don't order anything that is slightly different from the menu - book a table if you plan to go to TGI Fridays on a Friday evening! Or you'll have to wait for a while... - don't be on a rush - don't go there if you have a head ache, for it is very loud in there...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wien-2,,,,,
22,Carolina C.,"Innere Stadt, Vienna, Austria",0,6,,5.0,2014-03-09,Could go here every weekend! Jack Daniels burger is just to die for! All dishes tasted until now are just tastyyyyy! Cocktails are very good! Atmosphere is just nice!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wien-2?start=20,,,,,
18,Jakub G.,"Wrocław, Poland",32,115,358.0,5.0,2014-03-15,My first time at TGI Friday's and I'm pleasantly surprised. It's a great place to meet with friends. It's a big chain restaurant but the atmosphere they created here is really splendid. The prices are quite high but portions are big and you won't leave hungry. You can try looking for vouchers 'get two pay for one'. It's really worth it. The staff is friendly speaks very good English and doesn't make any problems when it comes to splitting the bill. I was there with a big group and honestly we made the paying process really complicated for the waiter. But he didn't even blink. Kudos!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wien-2,,,,,
21,Bernhard E.,"Favoriten, Austria",14,9,5.0,4.0,2014-10-08,"Das TGI Fridays gehört für mich zu den besten Burger-Lokalen in Wien. Dementsprechend verhält es sich dann auch mit freien Plätzen, denn nicht nur ich scheine so zu denken. Kommt man zur Hauptzeit, hat man es hier schwer einen Sitzplatz zu finden. In den wärmeren Monaten gibt es auch einen Garten mit mehreren Sitzplätzen, die erst recht sofort weg sind, wenn kurze Hosen an der Tagesordnung stehen.  Die Preise sind sicherlich teilweise recht hoch angesiedelt, doch der Geschmack kompensiert das wieder. Wenn man sich einen Jack Daniel's XL Burger für knapp unter € 20,- gönnt, verzeiht die Geldbörse spätestens beim ersten Biss wieder alles. Unglaublich gutes Fleisch mit einer köstlichen Sauce und perfekt gebackenen Brötchen.  Auch bei den anderen Speisen bekommt man Qualität geboten, ob's jetzt Fish'n'Chips, mexikanisch angehauchte Speisen oder eben mal ein Steak (immerhin betitelt sich das Lokal selbst als 'Steakhouse') in die Bestellung schaffen - man bekommt etwas für den Preis.  Sehr nett finde ich auch die Getränke-Aktionen, die es beispielsweise bei Junggesellenabschieden gibt. Hier bekommt man dann -50% auf die Cocktailkarte. So macht man sich recht schnell Freude.  Leichte Abzüge gibt's für den Service. Der wirkt meist bemüht, aber eben auch oftmals überfordert, angesichts der vielen Sitzplätze auch wenig verwunderlich.   Auch Sportfreunde kommen im Übrigen bei einigen Flatscreens auf ihre Kosten!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wien-2?start=20,,,,,
10,Victoria Y.,"Vienna, Austria",20,78,292.0,5.0,2014-11-24,Had a coupon for 1+1 main dish and decided to try it out with my mom. I ate at tgi before in America so I was looking forward to seeing how it is like in Vienna.  The restaurant inside is much more spacious and the music was not as loud as in America. I like it better the Vienna way(I don't like loud music). They still kept the signature stained glass and red and white stripes as decorations.  All the staff were so friendly and made us feel very comfortable. They all spoke fluent English. There weren't many people at the time we were there so our order came really quick. I had salmon steak and my mom had pasta. My salmon steak was very tender and tasty. I requested a salad instead of mashed potatoes on the side and they happily did it for me. I am quite picky sometimes with my order so I really appreciate it when the restaurant is willing to fulfill my requests. Tap water is free which is rare in Vienna and  came in a XL glass. I guess they follow the American way for this ;)  The waitress was very professional and asked how our meal was and if everything was alright.  I was very satisfied with our meal at tgi and will definitely be going there again!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wien-2,,,,,
14,Jerry I.,"Maricopa, AZ",151,131,709.0,4.0,2014-12-10,"To be honest, I actually like this place a lot better than the Hard Rock Cafe.  About 10 years ago, I would have thought the opposite, but I think the food and the drink selections here are a lot better.  First of all, I really like the chicken nachos here.  I like how they actually just take each individual tortilla chip and top it off with cheese, jalapeño, and grilled chicken.  The rest of the toppings, such as the pico de gallo, lettuce, sour cream, and guacamole, are right in the middle of the plate.  So it's not as messy as just throwing all the topping all on top of a pile of chips!  The ribs here are also outstanding, and I think they're up there in terms of quality and flavor, in comparison to the ubiquitous rib shacks here in Vienna.  Now don't get me wrong: there are plenty of great places to get ribs here in this town, but what makes this particular one unique is the Jack Daniels barbecue sauce that it's glazed with.  I also like to get Heineken on tap here, though I've also gotten a bucket of ice-cold beers as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wien-2,,,,,

8,Lisa H.,"Vienna, Austria",1005,185,1203.0,5.0,2015-03-06,"I do just love this place.  They have fantastic food and friendly service with a lot of personality.  Over the many years that I've been coming here there have only been one or two misunderstandings or reasons to complain and the staff has consistently solved these problems in superlative customer-friendly style.  If you want an authentic American eating experience, both from the point of view of food and service, this is the place to come.   They are GREAT with kids, too!  The staff jokes around with them and asks them questions, making them feel at ease and grown up. True, as some reviewers have metioned, it is quite loud here.  And the food can take a while to arrive.  But if you're prepared for that in advance, the rest is well worth it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wien-2,,,,,

15,Corinne M.,"Vienna, Austria",114,197,636.0,4.0,2015-10-31,"Have to say I am a fan of Friday's in America.  It was my college hangout and I miss it.  I could dine alone or with friends and be happy. The one in Vienna does a great job with friendly service and creating that American atmosphere.   I am not thrilled with the quality of the staple menu items like the Jack Daniel's Chicken, but I am pleasantly surprised how they put together a decent burger.   There are many options, great toppings and sauces and a nice array of sides.  Too bad they were out of sweet potato fries the day i went, but the steak fries were a nice substitute.  Be a little cautious with the Italian burger.  My husband had it and it wasn't as fresh as the picture looks and it was very greasy.  My mushroom burger and my family's bacon burgers were great.   All are cooked well done, but they weren't dry or tough.   Nice hang out spot, good for a night when ""well, just don't wanna go too far or pay too much in the city:)"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wien-2,,,,,

1,Undine O.,"Salzburg, Austria",33,97,117.0,4.0,2016-04-17,I am very surprised that most of reviews for TGI Fridays are not that good. I loved it here. The food was amazing - I had the Jack Daniels grilled chicken and my boyfriend tried the combo fajita tower. We were both very happy with our food. The Jack Daniels sauce that came with the grilled chicken was to die for!  I have to admit that the food here is a bit pricey but definitely worth it! Also the waiters were very friendly and cool.  The only reason I don't give them 5 stars - it is much too loud.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wien-2,,,,,

4,Bo D.,"Vienna, Austria",0,9,,4.0,2017-02-12,"This is it. The place for ultimate satisfaction.  The joint you go to when your insatiable cravings for all things meaty and juicy cannot be contained anymore (either that, or you just hate how healthy and fit you are). People don't  come here to just ""eat a burger"". They come here to sin. When you set this place as your destination, you know you're going to walk out satisfied as all hell - even if you'll barely be able to walk afterwards. The burgers are big. They are juicy. Along with the seasoned fries and that sweet, sweet jack daniels sauce, they make for an unforgettable experience. After the deed is done, sure, you'll feel a bit bad about yourself... On the other hand, you'll be happy you did it, and its taste will linger like a forbidden kiss.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wien-2,,,,,
