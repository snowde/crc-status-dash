2,David D.,"Phoenixville, PA",1,69,12.0,3.0,2013-02-09,"It literally is the only place that's open late and serves food and drink. The pretzel app was buttery and served with a beer/cheese sauce, so thumbs up. The lettuce they use on the burgers is pretty good. That is the end of the good things. Fries were undercooked. The bean burger was dry. The blue cheese bacon burger was a petrified salt sandwich. Pretty much what you expect from a chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wilkes-barre?start=20,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005
4,Scott P.,"Luzerne, PA",0,16,1.0,3.0,2013-03-06,"Food was great and price was great! Join strips and you get awesome coupons. We had buy one entree and get one free, no restrictions on price. Only bad thing was the service sucked. I don't think it was our waitress' fault. She was prompt on refills and requests. The kitchen dropped the ball on this visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wilkes-barre?start=20,,,,,
1,Jason L.,"Mountain Top, PA",85,280,69.0,4.0,2013-07-15,"Solid service and good food quality.  Almost never a wait for a table.  As far as chains go, this location is near the top.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wilkes-barre?start=20,,,,,
28,Angela G.,"Wilkes-Barre, PA",246,712,79.0,3.0,2013-08-05,"Decent specials. I come here from time to time for a drink and some apps. I'm not a big fan of their entrees though; the only thing I really like is their cajun pasta. The flatbread appetizer is pretty boring as well. For standard bar food and drinks, it's not too bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wilkes-barre,,,,,
21,Elizabeth B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",187,744,192.0,3.0,2013-09-21,"After an exhausting day of travel and work, my co-workers and I decided to dine at this TGI Friday's, which was located right next to our hotel. I have not been to a Friday's in a long time, but this location looked very old and dark. Hopefully, it will receive a renovation soon. I was most impressed by our waitress. She was very friendly and attentive without being overbearing.  I ordered two margaritas and the pick-three appetizer with wings, crispy green bean fries, and pretzels with beer-cheese. Though on the weaker side, the margaritas were tasty. I knew that I already loved the crispy green bean fries and was delightfully surprised by how tasty the pretzels were. Overall, my experience was not unique or special, but I did enjoy the food and the service. However, I was shocked to receive my bill. Somehow, my two tiny drinks and one appetizer equaled $32 (without tip). I was shocked! I think a bill this high for such little food is absolutely absurd.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wilkes-barre,,,,,
5,Laura E.,"Plymouth, PA",12,4,,5.0,2014-05-16,this place has excellent food and great service. my bestfriend took me here for my 20th birthday this year and let me tell ya the meal i got was excellent and we got a good deal too. we got to split a free ice cream since it was my birthday. i totally want to go again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wilkes-barre?start=20,,,,,
0,Doug B.,"Nanticoke, PA",0,1,,2.0,2014-05-29,Waitress was amazing all three times I have came to This restaurant. The wait for the food after 830 of 28 mins and then for my food to come out wrong each time I go there Is crazy though,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wilkes-barre?start=20,,,,,
20,Josh M.,"Manhattan, NY",541,532,2449.0,4.0,2014-06-23,I have been to This TGI Fridays multiple times over the past 3 years. The location is great. There is 3 hotels connected to this TGI Fridays. The parking lot is always full except past 10 pm most nights. All the other cars are hotel cars. There is a gas station across the street. And you could walk to a mall. You have to cross a 4 lane road but you could do it. I have before. This Fridays is also located 1-2 miles away from the Mohegan sun casino. When I first started going to this TGI service was hit or miss. There is one or two people still left from original staff. Now 3 years later the service is great staff is super friendly. They always remember me. I even had the hostess tell me the waitresses get mad when I don't get put in their section. I know 3 of the waitresses by name and we talk more about life and random stuff than we do food lol. The food is good it is chain food but the burgers are good and you can never go wrong with a drink and a appetizer like wings. Great atmosphere. It does get crowded during the busy times. Call for reservations. The parking lot isn't the biggest ether and is a bit tight when full. Other than that the place is great. Staff is super nice and I enjoy going to this TGI Fridays for a quick cheap meal. Can't go wrong.  PROS: - location. A lot around - friendly staff -cheap CONS: -parking - busy during peak hours,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wilkes-barre,,,,,
23,Kathy J.,"San Rafael, CA",20,91,3.0,5.0,2014-08-10,Love Fridays excellent food and service and is consistent. The sirloin steak with 2 sides is excellent! I stay at the Marriott next door which is excellent too! Really convenient too! Prices are very fair as well!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wilkes-barre,,,,,
29,John H.,"Forty Fort, PA",0,6,,2.0,2015-03-25,"Ate at TGI Fridays in wilkes-barre pa. Won't be back, my wife ordered the blue cheese burger, what a disappointment. Would of gotten more hamburger on a reg McDonalds burger at a $1.29! The blue cheese burger was supposed to be a double burger(not this one) with all the extras for $12. 90. The burger was thin, frozen and tasteless, it was full of grease and not at all appetizing. The bun overwhelmed the meal. The 5 fries that came with were hard to find. What a loser meal for a high price. Not again let the tourists eat there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wilkes-barre,,,,,
27,Karl H.,"Morgantown, WV",11,16,90.0,4.0,2015-06-15,"I had a Jack Daniel's Steak dinner with  salted caramel cake desert with ice cream , Linda had Chicken Bruschetta Pasta.

24,Charles A.,"Beeville, TX",4,15,1.0,2.0,2015-09-12,The food is standard tgi Fridays. It was pretty good. I sat at the bar as I always do. I ordered beer wife ordered beer. The low rating is the service. I sat here and ordered shots for myself and some servicemen two rounds. Sixty bucks just in alcohol not counting the beer. Afterwards the bartenders disappeared. I've been sitting here fifteen minutes and not one of them has said a word to me. Hope you like the ten percent tip. That's odd for me as my lowest is usually twenty percent for bad service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wilkes-barre,,,,,
25,Jesse R.,"Nanticoke, PA",0,22,,4.0,2015-09-29,"They recently remodeled this location and it looks great! Food is still awesome too!! The only downside, when eating outside, people are allowed to smoke nearby and it smells.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wilkes-barre,,,,,
26,Jonathan R.,"Wilkes-Barre, PA",9,7,,4.0,2015-11-20,Service was decent... they forgot my chicken tenders. All the food was amazing. Apps are great. I recommend getting the ribs.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wilkes-barre,,,,,
17,Mizie M.,"Cincinnati, OH",49,64,142.0,3.0,2016-04-09,"What can I say? It's a chain restaurant and it's what you'd expect from a Fridays. The service was decent and we appreciated the attention to some of our special orders due to allergies. The kitchen messed up and added every ingredient anyway, but the server caught it and had the kitchen remake the order. Thanks!  Note that if you are staying at Quality Inn then you can get a 10% discount DINE IN ONLY.  This Fridays would also deliver to rooms in the hotel for a $4.00 charge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wilkes-barre,,,,,
18,KarmaKon C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,14,,5.0,2016-06-10,"Stopped in late after the recent Louis CK show in WB and was pleasantly surprised by this Fridays. Sure, it's a chain, but this is one of the good ones ! The food was great, and I mean really great, not just ""Fridays/chain restaurant great"" ! One small error that was made on our order was taken care of quickly and then actually comped by very friendly management when we didn't even ask for an adjustment - he simply offered ! - and our server, Sarah, was just lovely ! It was winding down as it was late and not too busy, so she was able to stay to talk to us about our trip to Wilkes-Barre, asked how we liked the city, make menu recommendations, etc. What could have been just a very nice dinner turned into an absolute delight because of her ! When I go back later this year I will definitely stop in for dinner and I hope Sarah is there ! Worth noting that the restaurant was VERY clean - always a HUGE thing for me - and every single employee I saw was friendly and had a welcoming smile.  Because this location is attached to three hotels (I was staying in one of them) and very convenient, I'm sure a lot of people end up there by default, but this location is worth seeking out even if you're NOT a guest of one of the hotels !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wilkes-barre,,,,,
22,Karly G.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,3,,1.0,2016-08-11,While on a business trip alone I went to this Friday's because it was close to my hotel. I left this restaurant very unhappy with both the service and food. My original meal that I order had to be sent back because it was bad and cold. After receiving the horrible food I received no apology. Overall the food and customer service was terrible.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wilkes-barre,,,,,
14,Nova O.,"Kingston, PA",12,56,128.0,4.0,2016-08-11,"We prefer sitting at the bar at this restaurant and enjoying the delicious food, multiple televisions, and awesome bartenders. There's almost always some type of alcoholic beverage special for those who choose, but a nice variety of non-alcoholic beverages as well.       Food is consistently good. If there is a problem, they fix it. The remodeling helped update the overall look, and new food specials rotate semi-regularly. Much better than the average franchise. Definitely give it a try if you're in the area.  *There is a Pokéstop right outside, but it can only be reached by certain areas in the restaurant. ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wilkes-barre,,,,,
19,John Z.,"Kingston, PA",1,5,,2.0,2016-08-22,The food is what it is. Franchise food that does the job but my god are the prices out of control on booze. I paid over 6 dollars for a blue moon draft (unheard of outside of NYC). Three beers for 20 dollars. I thought I was in Manhattan or a casino when I got my bill. Haven't gone to a franchise in a long time and I will never be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wilkes-barre,,,,,

13,Jim S.,"Wilkes-Barre, PA",0,8,,2.0,2017-06-14,"I am a regular, at least once a week for lunch.  Good food but overpriced.  Typically good service.  Only frustration is their loyalty program and coupons.  The rules seem to change daily, based on who the waitress or waiter is.  Can make you look like a fool when you ask questions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wilkes-barre,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003
11,Amanda L.,"Rosendale, NY",14,49,16.0,3.0,2017-07-07,"Conveniently located next to 3 hotels. Came into town on business twice within the last month and stayed at an adjacent hotel, ordered take out to bring back to my room. First time I ordered a bacon cheese burger with mashed potatoes and I had no complaints! Food was good and what was expected for a standard chain restaurant. Last night I ordered their million dollar cobb salad and I was disappointed. Some of the lettuce was slimey and rotted so I had to pick around it, I had an excessive amount of onions and there was no avocado. Having avocado was one of the main reasons I ordered the salad. Next time I'm in town I'll probably venture out as there are plenty of other places around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wilkes-barre,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002

10,Nicholas H.,"Vineland, NJ",41,127,126.0,4.0,2017-11-24,"I love eating at T.G.I. Fridays, especially this location. Back when I was in high school this restaurant was the go-to hangout for my graduating class. Now, almost fifteen years later, I can honestly say that I've never had a bad meal. I'm particularly fond of the Jack Daniels chicken sandwich. Even their steaks are great and that's a pretty big deal for a chain restaurant. The bar is wonderful and I particularly enjoy the way they make Old Fashions, though I confess to having an Ultimate Strawberry Daiquiri from time to time. My stepbrother worked as a flair bartender during the late 90s and tried to teach me how to twirl and juggle liquor bottles; needles to say, it was not a success and I will leave the showmanship to the professionals.  I am a grown man (according to most) but I also enjoy the occasional Cup of Dirt for dessert: it contains chocolate pudding, crushed Oreo cookies, and gummy worms. I tried to make it myself once with alternating layers of chocolate pudding and whipped cream covered by cookie crumbles but it just wasn't the same. Maybe this is just nostalgia speaking, but I'm not thrilled with the remodel. The old layout was more welcoming.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wilkes-barre,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004
