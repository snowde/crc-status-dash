I'm only taking the time out to write this review because this particular Friday's is just awful.  Most of them are pretty consistent and okay.  For some reason, the Wood Ridge Friday's is just totally different from the rest. First of all, the food is never consistent.  It usually does not come with the correct condiments or is prepared how the menu describes and most of the time it has to be sent back.  This is the only Friday's that serves nachos differently from the other Friday's.  They are a piled up mess of fake cheese.  Every single time I have been here the food was either over cooked or undercooked or just plain disgusting.  Yes, I know it's Friday's but I've had enjoyable junk food at pretty much all of the other ones in North Jersey.   The servers/bartenders, however, are usually very nice, although not very quick.  I can judge because I was a server/bartender for years.  I waited for the bartender's attention to order food for about 25 minutes.  The only reason that I didn't leave was because I was hungover and too lazy to get up.   I don't know why I keep coming back here.  I just have to step on the brakes a little earlier and go to Houlihan's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wood-ridge?start=40,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000004

Nothing like coming in with friends and family, and leaving full and satisfied. Service is decent, sometimes there's a wait... but that's to be expected, they get busy some nights. Overall, it's a pretty clean place with a big parking lot. The only advice I would give them is this... have the maintenance guy go around. Some chairs wobble way too much, some lights flicker or are burnt out, and some table tops feel loose.

Other poster was right on a very specific point...send a maintenance guy around to tighten up the chairs...all most of of them need some work. Watch out for amateur drinkers here as sometime they don't handle themselves well. As with all Fridays, look for the specials or coupons to get the best value. Avoid the Nachos...Nothing more than tortilla chips with a spattering of meat and a few shreds of cheese. Instead try the Pretzel sticks w/ cheese sauce or the Jack Daniels Sesame Chicken Strips. I also have a problem with another one of the reviewers. ""They didn't want to serve you because you were colored?"" c'mon bro...it;s 2013...That place is filled with white, black and everything else.

52,Robert A.,"Rochelle Park, NJ",19,114,5.0,2.0,2013-04-05,Went for lunch. After a long wait the manager came over stated Victor would be our server and he would help us shortly. He then took our drink order.  When the manager brought our drinks He also brought out an order of nachos and then took our food order. The food was actually delivered by Victor our server. The food was ok and having a gift card meant it cost me nothing to eat that day. Considering the place was mostly empty I think they need to get some servers to actually wait tables.   On a previous visit to this location the service was even slower and they delivered the pretzel appetizer raw!.   With several other complaints about the food that day the manager comped the entire meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wood-ridge?start=60,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024

51,Luis S.,"Kearny, NJ",0,2,,1.0,2013-12-16,I hope people read this review before wasting their money at this horrific restaurant. I was out with my family on a Sunday afternoon so we decided to go eat at this TGIF in Wood-Ridge NJ Route 17. For the most part the service was decent but the portion on this specific dish was very short. We ordered Chicken Jack Daniel's Strips and we literally received about 5 pieces so I asked the waiter if that was the normal portion? She replied buy saying that all dishes are measured sometimes they overflow and sometimes they don't. So she contradicted herself in one sentence. She took the order back and brought out a new one with what seem to be a normal portion of about 10-12 pieces. I didn't think much of it and we actually enjoyed the rest of the stay until I ordered my second beer. After taking a couple of sips of my cup my wife asks me if I had kissed someone with lipstick on because she didn't remember putting any on. I asked her why and she pointed at the cup that I was drinking from and it clearly had someone's lipstick stain on the rim of the glass. You can't imagine how disgusted I felt. I immediately asked to see the manager and showed him the cup and he apologized and stated that I would not have to pay for the beer. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?????? The beer???? I took 2 sips from the beer how the hell was I going to pay for that???? Who's going to pay for my medical bill if I happen to get sick or even worst get herpes or something???? I paid for my check and It's safe to say that I will never return to this TGIF in my life!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wood-ridge?start=60,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.9240000000000002

No big deal.... We head inside and there was no one to seat is for several minutes. We finally was seated in a nice booth by our selves and it was pretty peaceful. We were greeted by a very nice server who was polite and checked on us throughout the entire meal. Her service after being seated was 5 stars all day.  I ordered steak and shrimp n my wife ordered steak and lobster. My steak was suppose to be Jack Daniels however I got a dry hockey puck. The shrimp and mash potatoes were good though. My wife's steak was good but her lobster pieces were way over cooked. We did not send the food back as it was 11pm and we were starving! I just remember Fridays as a very solid place to go get great food with out breaking the bank. I hate to say it but i equate the food to what you get at the drive thru.

We didn't bother calling him back over, just did the math ourselves to square up and tip.  Feel bad for the kid, saw him messing up many other orders when he was actually around.  Clearly, he's just not good at this kind of job.   As for the food, mediocore at best.  It looked yummy, but most of it was microwable quality.  Don't get me wrong, I eat microwavables lol Just...don't want it to taste like that at a restaurant.  The mozzarella sticks were bleh.  I had one bite of the desert, but it was too frozen for a real take on quality.  My fav part was probably the mac n cheese that came with my Parmesian Crusted Chicken.  But what do you expect, it's Fridays.  One thing they have going for them is their setting.  Very lounge like and comfortable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wood-ridge?start=20,2.36,2.36,2.36,1.9920000000000002,2.36
59,Carter W.,"Paramus, NJ",4,79,106.0,2.0,2014-09-27,"This TGI Friday's used to be my go to spot to watch NFL games on Sundays. It was never too packed, they have a bunch of TVs and happy hour specials all day long.  I've been visiting here for a few years now and I've seen a lot of turnover but the service here has really gone downhill. On one visit, a manager was helping out at the bar (which was about 1/2 full) and neither he nor the bartender came to bring us new drinks for over 10 minutes. Part of our food order was never brought out even after we asked about it twice.  The draft beers are always a little warm compared to other restaurant bars. The potato skins are disgusting (it's like a half inch square of american cheese is microwaved on it). The mozzarella sticks are hollow and rarely warm. You'll never have your wings the same way twice. One time you'll have six wings, another time a dozen. One time they'll be doused in sauce, the other time you'll be wondering if they thought you ordered naked wings.  The happy hour prices have all gone up by a buck. Not too big a deal but coupled with the fact that the service quality has dropped and I'm more than happy to go to Houlihans next door or to another place. There are a few people here who are still really cool but it looks like they're onto bigger and better places and good for them, they should leave here.  TIP: On a crowded night, ALWAYS sit at the bar.

38,Robyn C.,"New York, NY",85,133,36.0,1.0,2015-03-15,"Mediocracy at its best.  I stopped in on a Saturday night around 8.  The restaurant was packed, and there were people waiting at the door for tables.  Since I was by myself and just wanted to grab a quick bite, I sat at the bar.   There were two bartenders working behind the bar but I only interacted with the female bartender.   She took my drink and food order.  I asked for a glass of Kendall-Jackson Chardonnay.  Uhm, apparently TGIFridays now operates like McDonalds and there are sizes to their wine?  Anyway, I didn't realize their glasses of wine came in sizes and so I just ordered ""a glass"".  The surprise came at the end when I got the bill.  The bartender never asked what size glass of wine I wanted and assumed I wanted the more expensive 9 oz at $10.50.  I get that you're trying to fatten up the bill so that you can get a higher tip but it's not cool when you take the liberty to do so without asking your customer.  The wine tasted funky anyway, like the bottle had been open for a while.   I ordered the Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta and asked for shrimp only, no chicken.  When my food came out, it was half shrimp, half chicken.  I guess the bartenders here just do things differently and not ask questions or get customers' orders right?  Anyway, the dish tasted just ok, it didn't have that Cajun kick and not how I had remembered it tasting.   She never once came and asked how everything was, so I couldn't let her know that the wine tasted old and that she messed up my food order.  However, she was prompt to come over to grab my credit card when I put it out to pay my bill.   Having been a server/bartender myself, I always feel compelled to over tip but even giving $3 on my bill felt unjustified.  I get that they earn their money on tips but it's not a hand out.  You actually have to do the serving.   I'm not sure how TGIFridays are training their staff or what server manual they're using but they need to get their act together.  It's the simple things.  I will definitely not go back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wood-ridge?start=20,2.32,2.32,2.32,1.8600000000000003,2.32

The waitress informed me that I would need to pay extra to customize my pasta. I had never got that from any of the other TGIFs because I was just replacing a sauce but I obliged anyways. After waiting for another 40 mins, we finally got our food. It was pretty obvious that the food had been prepared long before and was just sitting at the kitchen counter inside. We ordered the Flatbread which was cold. The fries seemed stale and the pasta had dried out. We took a bite and realized we cannot eat this rubbish.

After a good 10 minutes go by I get up and walk to the host and ask him to please find our server.  Within minutes server arrives very apologetic for the long delay, takes our appetizer and drink orders, we explain that 2 more people are coming. This time we wait for almost 15 minutes, no drinks, no server, empty dining area except for the 2 of us. I get up again and ask the host to please get our server and explain that he took our drink order and hasn't returned. **frustrated** After a few minutes said server comes with our drinks and our appetizers and gives us a story of being under staffed blah blah blah. By this point my husband and 4yr old daughter have driven from our house to Friday's and sat down. YES, it took that long to get our drinks!! I ordered the drinks before he left my house! Spinach dip looks disgusting, like it had been frozen and heated up in a microwave, it wasn't even hot, it was warm and looked very unappetizing. Not saying anything, not worth waiting forever for something different. Besides who are we going to ask, the host? My husband orders a beer. AGAIN, very long wait, he gets up to go ask the host (only employee that we can see) for his beer. The bartender happened to round the corner with the beer just as he got up. No server. The server finally brings my sister's meal. He then picks up our unfinished appetizers, not even asking if we are finished with it, (we weren't), and goes to walk away!!

6,Paulette S.,"Kearny, NJ",74,87,25.0,1.0,2017-04-04,"Where do I begin this review...... First of all, when we drove up to the restaurant, the parking lot was virtually empty. I think the only cars that were parked there were the cars of the employees. We were seated by the bar, and the first words out of Bobby's mouth were, what the f is that smell? I think I am going to puke. The waiter came up to us and proceeded to to say, ""hi folks, what can I get for you?"".  I then answered, ""you can get us a seat elsewhere because it smells over here."". He says, ""oh really, I can't smell anything?"".   We should have walked out at that point but we foolishly didn't. We get seated at another part of the restaurant closer to the front door. He took our orders and we ordered the Friday's appetizer combo with buffalo chicken wings, mozzarella sticks, and potato skins. I ordered the same thing I have ordered at a Fridays for the last 28 years and that is the chicken fingers with french fries and extra honey mustard. Bobby ordered a cheeseburger. I ordered a strawberry lemonade for a drink and Bobby ordered a Diet Coke. Both drinks came with free refills.   At any other Friday's restaurant in which I have eaten, the chicken fingers come out pretty much the size of chicken cutlets. That's my over-exaggerated way of saying you get an awful lot of food.  I take one bite of my chicken fingers and automatically my gag reflex kicks in.  I wanted to vomit.  The chicken was freezer burned and yet slightly undercooked at the same time.  The breaded coating outside of the chicken had absolutely no seasoning and was also fried in an undercooked way. Absolutely nothing like the way the chicken fingers have been served to me in the last 28 years in numerous other Fridays restaurants. Bobby had a funny look on his face so I decided to take a bite of his Burger. The meat had no flavor because it was freezer burnt meat and because it had no seasoning. Now, between the time we finished our appetizer and we got our main course, the waiter who took our orders asked us if we wanted drink refills. Bobby said he wanted another Diet Coke. You would think that we would get his drink pretty instantaneously considering the restaurant is completely devoid of customers. But that did not happen. It was almost a blessing that the food was completely inedible comma since he had no beverage to wash his food down with.  The refill on his diet coke never arrived.  I had to track somebody down to get us the check because nobody was coming to check on us. When we finally get the bill, it was $49 and some change. So basically appetizer to drinks chicken fingers in a burger was $50. The girl who brought us our check ask if you wanted to food wrapped up since we barely touched them. I told her no we did not because they were completely inedible. She then proceeded to ask if I wanted to speak to the manager. Gee, Captain Obvious, what do you think the answer to that question is? The manager comes over and asks us the problem and we tell her everything that transpired. We told her we had no problem paying for the drinks and appetizers since we did consume them but we had an issue paying for the burgers and chicken fingers considering we couldn't eat them at all. We couldn't even bring it home because there would have been no point, it would have gone straight to the garbage.  Any other restaurant I have ever been in, the manager would have just comped us the whole bill, even though we had offered to pay for the appetizer. To me, that's just good customer service. Needless to say, we will never go back to this place again.  After I post this review on Yelp and Facebook, I will contact their corporate headquarters to see if this place should be shut down all together. My reasoning for this, is that after I thought about what that smell was when we were sitting by the bar, I came to the realization that smell comes from places which have a cockroach infestation. Also, Bobby had to flick something off the table when we first sat down. I told him after the fact that it was the shell that cockroaches come out of when they go from baby cockroaches to adult cockroaches. You have all been warned.

The waiter then explains that the first round will be half orders, and once the first order has been delivered to the table we can ask for subsequent orders. According to the waiter, we can order anything on the list. I decided to order meatballs, another person decided to order quesadillas, and the other person decided to order potato skins. The waiter, trying to be friendly, said he'll take her second orders now. So, for our second round,  we ordered potstickers, chicken wings, and nachos. After about 30 minutes our first order finally arrived. We all got potato skins. We started working on our potato skins, when the next round appeared. The second round came out correctly.

4,Pilky K.,"Hackensack, NJ",6,21,5.0,1.0,2017-11-10,"Why does anyone even go to this TGI Fridays anymore?  The review are terrible and nothing gets fixed.  After I wrote my review a year ago, the manager contacted me and offered a free lunch.  I didn't take him up on the offer but did give him some advice.  He said this TGI Fridays was an underperforming restaurant and he was brought into to try to fix the issues.  The problems have obviously not been resolved.  I drive by the place during lunch time regularly and never see more than a few cars in the parking lot.  It seems the people in the area know how bad it is.  My advise:  stay away until management and the corporate office decide to do something with this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wood-ridge,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002

2,Kenny N.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",173,1,,1.0,2017-11-18,"I usually go to the TGI Fridays on Route 3, but for convenience sake we came to this one. Honestly, we didn't even get to the part of ordering drinks because we never got the chance to. My family and I got seated, and the waiter didn't even bother to show his face until I started looking around for our waiter. He said that he had a table that asked for all separate checks and asked us to hold on. We waited for 20 minutes and he was still figuring out the checks. He could have at least taken our drink orders or something. My family got fed up with this kind of service and we decided to leave. My dad, who usually doesn't get angry, told the waiter he wasn't happy with this kind of service. We got absolutely no apologies and just excuses. He basically claimed that it wasn't his fault because he explained his situation to us. He got angry at us.  To make things worse, the manager was right next to him and didn't say a word. We will be never coming here again. And seeing all these 1 star ratings show that this place isn't doing so hot. Please drive the extra 10 minutes to go to the TGI Fridays on route 3.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wood-ridge,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002
