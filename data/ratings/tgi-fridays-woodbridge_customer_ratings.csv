We like to order everything at once, just because we're weird like that. I ask if that's okay and our server says that he'll be our Huckleberry. Not sure what that meant, but okay. I got Mozarella sticks, and the flat iron steak, medium rare with broccoli and mashed potatoes. It was all very good and very filling, I couldn't even finish it.

125,Stephanie T.,"Bothell, WA",146,119,3.0,1.0,2013-03-10,"If I could, I'd probably give this a 1/2 a star it was so terrible.  My husband and I stopped in after dropping off his tux at Men's Warehouse.  His receipt from Men's warehouse showed the time of 4:26 PM, putting us at TGIF across the street at nearly exactly 4:30.  We first arrived and they had to have someone clean a table for us.  Mind you there were about 5 other visibly open clean tables.  So while we are waiting 10 minutes for our table to be cleaned another family comes in after us asking for a party of 8-10 people.  They were told they would need to wait 30 minutes to be seated, when there were no others in line and open tables that could be quickly pushed together to seat them, probably in less time then it took them to clean our table.... After wishing them good luck, we headed to our booth, where we proceeded to put in our drink and apps order.  We were told immediately that the bar was backed up so that my milkshake and his beer may take awhile..... After waiting about 25 minutes, my husband's beer came out -- Still no milkshake. We placed our dinner order and about the 45 minute mark, our appetizer finally came out, which was actually good.  Still no milkshake.  So finally the manager comes to inform me that they are out of milk and they are sending someone to WalMart to buy some more -- When it arrived, my milkshake would be on the house.....  So we wait some more. Finally our meals come out about the hour and 20 minute mark.  My husbands Jack Daniel Double shrimp was not good. He didn't even eat half of it.  His caesar salad which came out with his meal was disgusting.  My black bean burger was not great, but ok, after I waited another five minutes for mayo.  My salad had wilted lettuce and came with the wrong dressing.... The bathrooms were not very clean and the whole experience was pretty terrible.  I did finally get my milkshake and it was pretty good..... Our total meal came to about $50 and probably the biggest waste of $50 in a long time.  Our server was nice, but slow and overwhelmed.  The entire facility does not appear to be well managed and though the staff appears to be working really hard, it's clear that they are short on staff.   Each time we have gone to TGIF it's been subpar. I was really thinking this time it might be better since they've changed up their menu a bit, but sadly I was mistaken. There are a ton of other restaurants in the area.  Don't waste your time at this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-woodbridge?start=100,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000004

The constant patrol of the security guy freaked me out to another level.  Sir this is not Detroit or a prison so please stop walking around with your flashlight. 3.) The DJ constantly coming over the mic to holler and yell and people coming in and out.  Also the shoutout thing is not cute.   4.) I had literally had to help the girl clean off the table because she was so overwhelmed by the noise, craziness, and constant demand for her.  I felt bad for her and I hope she made it through the night.   So in conclusion if you are in Hoodbridge and you are not feeling like hitting up a rachet club in DC this may be for you.   The two stars would have been three however with the lounge type thing they have going on and my usual tendency to eat in the evenings kind of ruined it for me.  Other saving graces are the fast service, attentive and night wait staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-woodbridge?start=80,1.768,1.768,1.768,1.768,1.7680000000000002

This place has a weird stench I remember each time I've been. This is my last time going to this location. Server was nice but SUPER SLOW!!! Ordered a Bacardi bc they don't have any other silver rum. My drink took over 15 minutes to arrive. Apps were average and not very warm. The chicken tasted frost burned(yuck). The friends wanted dessert but I was not waiting another 30 minutes to get that.

110,Jesse C.,"Woodbridge, VA",26,50,47.0,2.0,2013-06-07,"Pros: Service was better than previous experiences, sat down immediately  Cons: Food quality continues to be down, drinks are watered down/filled with mixers           After MANY bad experiences with T.G.I.Fridays we decided to try it out once again. We have had a bad experience in the past with this exact T.G.I.Fridays with some of the management being rude, and the quality of food being horrible. PAST Experience: Found a large piece of plastic in my mashed potatoes (they're shipped in a plastic bag. The manager at the time was less than apologetic. The overall manager was nice and offered to help make the experience better.) RECENT:  We went here after many bad experiences hoping that our faith would be restored but sadly we were let down. We were sat fairly quickly for being a later Friday night (8:00pm). Although this could be seen as a bad thing as most restaurants in Woodbridge would have had a wait. I will say the service was pretty good this time around. Takiia our server was fairly nice and was good to meet our every need. She didn't exactly go above and beyond by any means, but better than previous experiences. Drinks (alcohol drinks) were watered down. Sadly our main complaint is towards the food again! My frustration is with the California club. I have been ordering it for many lunches on the ciabatta bread, to find out tonight that it has changed to the baguette but wasn't changed on the menu. (It has been changed on the online menu). Most servers didn't even know it had changed. My other concern is my wife's food. She ordered a New York Cheddar and Bacon Burger and bit down on a small, hard, white object in her burger meat, such as a piece of bone or similar item. It was probably the size of a pea - half dime. We didn't bring either issue up to our server as we hate to be those people who complain, although I do want to pass this information to hopefully warn others about the food here. We're sad to say that we won't be going back to T.G.I.Fridays in the future with the past issues with food and service. We used to have great experiences here and looked forward to the food, but until the quality of both rises, we will never return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-woodbridge?start=80,1.8,1.8,1.8,1.8,1.8000000000000003

I was kind of disappointed that she wasn't the one bringing us our food and drinks considering it wasn't that busy, but she more than made up for it in service. I only give this place 2 stars however because we had the unfortunate luck of sitting next to the door and the greeter's stand. Since it was not busy, a lot of the waiters came to stand there and complain about their customers and sit around. They didn't really pay much attention to the fact they had customers sitting right next to them. It was also unsettling to watch them play around with each other and at one point in each others hair, and then go on to someone's table and handle food.

My major complaint about this TGIF is the quality of food and drinks, and yes there is a big difference. We ordered the long island ice tea, mojito and a blue moon and all tasted horrible (YES, even a blue moon draft tasted bad...). The long island ice tea was basically clear, watered down, and barely had any coke. The mojito was watered down and tasted like the sugar syrup.

Normally it is a fantastic place with a nice atmosphere and great staff. However today after working a late shift and I go in and what I saw was beyond appalling it was downright revolting.  The people at the bar were extremely loud And very rude and exceptionally vulgar. As my hour here progressed; I felt more and more uncomfortable and at points felt more than a little threatened by the increasing homophobic statements coming from a group at the bar. They made several rude, callus and derogatory statements towards gay people in general and used of course, vulgar language.  Normally my boyfriend and I love to go go here, and I am thankful I came alone tonight because I would have been terrified to bring my boyfriend here and I am thankful I didn't. After what I saw here tonight I would be hard pressed to come here ever again. Seeing as though management tolerates extremely homophobic and vulgar bar patrons, since I saw the manager off in a corner laughing and never once asking the group at the bar to perhaps not shout at the top of their lungs and maybe they don't need to use such staggeringly inappropriate language.

I thought the food was pretty good and service was ok. I had a $5 off coupon, but the waitress said I couldn't use it because I had ordered their appetizer and entree deal, which i guess they consider it to be a coupon discount, and they can't accept 2 coupons. I told them to take the $5 off a different entree, but they said they could only accept 1 coupon per table. After having to explain that I'm only using 1 coupon and the items were ordered off menu, the manager was finally able to make it work. $5 isn't a big deal and we sill tipped 20%, but that was a whole lot more effort than was necessary.

Another time I brought my family that was visiting from florida. After a 13 hour drive they were starving. Big mistake. It was around 8pm on a Wednesday. Place was pretty empty. & we were a party of 7. Walked in & was told we'd have to wait despite no one actually being there. 20 minutes later & 5 couples that walked In a got seated we were finally sat. That should've been a sign. The waitress was rude when asking if something was good or not. Forgot a drink. Food took 45 minutes, & was told the wait was due to cook walking out. Appetizers weren't delivered til reminding them. Steak was cold. Sauces were forgotten. & after food was delivered waitress went MIA. Probably because she knew service SUCKED and thought they're not gonna tip so why bother? Drinks were never filled. It was sad. A manager came by to ask about our experience & boy did we tell them. They offered free desert. All of us were pretty much done, but my father wanted some Oreo ice cream sandwich thing. 20 minutes later we were so upset we paid and left. On our way out some girl delivers a sad excuse for a dessert that literally looked like it came out of a wrapper. WHY'D IT TAKE SO LONG?! Don't go there. It's literally a giant disappointment.

We were starving so we didn't put up a fight and sat in high chairs by the bar area. Normally, this wouldn't bother me but it only went downhill from there.  Here are some reasons you shouldn't come here: 1) No soap in the bathroom. Fine, you ran out. Refill it. It shouldn't take me two times of asking and another 15 min wait.  2) Appetizer: chicken flat bread. Matzah has more flavor.  3) Soda was supposed to be coke zero and tasted like root beer. 4) Waiting on burgers. 5) Still waiting... 6) Starving and waiting... 7) After 30-40 minutes my friend and I got our burgers but my girlfriend didn't. The fries had no seasoning, and our double stack all American burgers were tiny and overcooked. The term ""well done"" was taken to a whole new level. I don't think I've ever had a restaurant burger that had crunch to it from being so overcooked. Also, I asked for no bacon on mine and I got bacon.  8) The server came out and brought my girlfriend's burger which was the spicy craft beer-cheese burger. It's supposed to come with fried jalapenos and regular jalapenos. What came out did not remotely resemble that. It had two pieces of what was supposed to be fried jalapenos, which really looked like fried batter and a smidget of jalapeno. There were no regular jalapenos in it.  Despite all of this, our server was a nice guy. But, service in general lagged to say the least and kitchen staff were completely disoriented. They had to have been if they could throw out the crap food they provided.

I'm also going to say that a pet peeve of mine is a dirty bathroom. Makes you wonder if the kitchen is clean and although this one was clean... Kind of, the paper towel dispenser was automatic as many of them are now days. Not to problem normally, but this one would only give you maybe three inches of paper then you had to rip it off to get more.

I decided to pop in and grab a quick bite to go before going to see a movie at the theater nearby, and I could not wait to get out of there. I contemplated sitting inside and eating my food, but quickly vetoed that idea when I got to the front door.  There were people right by the door loitering like it was a club, smoking and making it incredibly uncomfortable to to inside. Right by the hostess stand there was a DJ, and the music was so loud I couldn't even hear myself think. I had to waive over a hostess and we had to walk away from the door and DJ just so she could hear my order.  The place was dead, understandable given how loud everything was, and how it seemed more like a club than a restaurant, which was inappropriate for a 'family' restaurant so close to a mall on a Friday evening. It was barely 9pm when I got there and it was so loud and obnoxious that I didn't even want to sit in the restaurant to wait for my to-go appetizer.  It took forever just to get that, and I'm so glad that I didn't order anything more complicated than the chicken strips.  The food itself was well prepared, but there was no consideration for patrons who might have wanted dinner without the loud music. There wasn't a special event going on, and it was like trying to sit inside a speaker.  Overall it was a horrible experience, and completely unexpected for the Friday's closest to Potomac Mills. I could not expect trying to actually sit in and have a meal there, given how inattentive the staff was and how slow the food service was. Do Not Go.

Because I was a given a warning about my food delay and because maybe the 20 minutes delay might turn into 40 I thanked the host and walked away.  I would definitely comeback when I have a good hour to myself, unfortunately today, I'm on my way to work so I guess I'll eat for free at work instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-woodbridge?start=40,1.72,1.72,1.72,2.064,1.7200000000000002

Anywho, we ordered some wings, pot stickers, and the crown Apple coolers.  The drinks were good, and the food was hot. The reason why I'm giving them three stars is because the bartender forgot about us. Luckily, Ms. Lexis was there to rescue us. It was nice to talk to her.

I called back to again be put on hold for 25 mins before someone took my order. It took the person I was speaking with 20 mins to take my order. When I asked for my total, I was asked to hold on. I was on hold waiting for my total for an additional 37 mins. Yes I held on because my husband was on his way to pick up the order, ( now on a conference call)I held on until he got there. Still on the phone with him and TGIF, he asked for the manager to complain about the service and to tell them I was STILL on the phone waiting. So now the order taker cones back to the phone with a total. I've been on the phone between holding on and being hung up on now for 90 mins. And all I got was I am sorry and 10% off my meal.

The waiter ask did we want salads before meals come or before. We ask for the salads first. Well the salads never came. We order our meals again 1 cheeseburger cook medium well with lettuce, tomato, onion and mayo on the side. And absolutely no pickles allergies. Got the cheeseburger and the burger was still cold and what made matters worse no onion. Even though the burger was cold it had pickles under cheese. Luckily my wife took a bite of the before I did. Cause if I had ate the burger I would have had cardiac stroke and it would been worse. My wife order Bruschshrimp  with no-Parmesan well it came with it. So my wife was upset. because it was like the waiter wasn't listening or just didnt care. Cause he repeated everything we order and nothing came back correct. I  just just pay the bill to which I did and left.  Nevertheless I don't what the problem there but this the very worst experience at a TGIF, Cause I would been alittle more understanding if the manager was avaliable but he had step away for a minute be back. The other problem was I didnt understand why everything was wrong because the resturant was pretty much empty less then 10 tables were occupy with customers. And our order took 30 minutes or so minutes. When I ask for the check the salads were on the bill. I called to the waiter and told him the bill was wrong. He corrected and return with explanation that it was the kitchen mixup. Anyway. We have been coming Fridays for awhile usually at  the 22302 Alexandria about once or twice a month.

Yesterday happened to be our wedding anniversary and we weren't really in the mood for anything fancy so we decided to come here. Bad idea. We usually go to either Tysons or Springfield Friday's, but we recently moved to Woodbridge and this is the one closest to us. Bad service, bad food. Our server never came to our table unless we were able to get her attention. I asked for the Jack Daniel's burger and she didn't bother to ask how I wanted it cooked or what I wanted on it. I thought, fine... I'll just take the pickles off and I like my meat cooked pretty thoroughly, which is usually standard at most places. No biggie. I was about half way into my burger when I take a bite and pull out a piece of plastic wrap about 3 or 4 inches long. Yuck. It took away my appetite and we asked the waitress to take it back. She came back with a coupon card for a free desert on our next visit. Definitely won't be having it at this location. My husband had the Jack Daniel's sampler as his entree... This is our favorite appetizer and we get it almost every time. He said the ribs were burnt and tasted awful. The shrimp tasted like it was days old. We also got the BBQ Chicken Flatbread as a starter and it tasted like it had been sitting out for hours-on-end and popped into the microwave before it was served to us. Lastly, we ordered our all-time favorite dessert; Brownie Obsession. Such a disappointment. The brownie was cold, where as it is usually served super hot and moist and melty. I wish they had given our food to a different table like the girl who brought it out almost did before being told by those people that it wasn't theirs.

What I got was the burgers patties with small spots of the sauces and a weird braised onion mixture with a couple of pieces of chopped meat that I could not identify.  (I like to assume it was sausage).

69,Eric W.,"Jessup, MD",3,24,7.0,1.0,2017-01-19,"I'm usually a very fair reviewer, but my experience at this specific TGI Fridays had me and my fair lady about 2-3 minutes from getting up and leaving.  After waiting 46 minutes and having not received our simple salads.  I hope that no patron visits this TGI Fridays for the first time otherwise they would never go to a TGI Fridays again.  I know that the brand isn't the fault, but merely the way this specific branch is run.  I'll attempt to reach out to the branch manager or higher to explain and attempt to bring some light to this restaurant. I will list out the scenario so future visitors can decide if this specific address for TGI Fridays they would really endure visiting.  We spent a majority of the day shopping and running errands, and needed to hit the gym later in the evening.  Since we hadn't eaten much previously, I figured a salad before the workout would help and the parking lot at this TGI Fridays was empty.  So service should be pretty quick and snappy for a measly salad right?  Well, upon entering it took about 5 minutes of standing next to the hostess stand before we were seated.  Upon being seated, it took ten minutes for a waiter to come and receive our drink orders, water with lemon.  Then two separate parties came in, and they were seated.  They then received more attentive service before us but I let that slide.  The kicker was after about 15 minutes we finally got our waters, and gave the waiter our salad orders with a side of sweet potato fries.  One of the other tables got one of the large appetizer samplers.  We figured surely our salads should be ready soon if they got their order so quickly and we've been staying longer.  Well our waiter was working our table plus the other two and it was becoming increasingly frustrating that our quick meal turned into an actual event.  As our wait time approached 40 minutes, I was about to just get up and leave, but decided to give them another chance.  46 minuets into the meal our food came out, we had a weak amount of sweet potato fries made for us but the salads came out and tasted fine. At this point I was annoyed, but didn't bother to take it out on anyone we just kept our comments.  I noted that they forgot the pecan crusted chicken on my salad so someone had the chef cook that up for me and about 7-8 minutes later it came out.  For what this experience is worth, I would give it 0 stars.  However, you can't do that on yelp and at least when the food finally arrived in bits and pieces off the assembly line it tasted good enough.  Also the fork that I initially had was all bent up, I tried to fix it myself then just requested a new set of silverware...  Overall, I'm a easy going person so despite our waiter making a few mistakes with our order, etc.  His attitude was positive and he didn't give off a vibe that he wasn't trying.  I just guess that something dramatic was going bad back in the kitchen because receiving our order took way too long for a simple salad.  Needless to say, I am not inclined to eat at this TGI Fridays or anyone for that matter.  I will attempt to put effort into getting the issue fixed so others don't suffer the same way we did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-woodbridge?start=20,2.08,2.08,2.08,1.4440000000000002,2.08

It's even gone to the point where we were at another TGI and the server we have there was chatting with us and said there's always issues at the Potomac mills store. When we go to PM, there's always the same 2 gentleman servers working their butts off. They are amazing, amazing servers. There's usually 3-4 hosts and they never seem pleased we are there. Usually it takes 5 mins for them to stop chatting for them to finally ask how many and to sit us. Always with lots of sass and eye rolling of course. When we order take out, there is always an issue with the order. Always something forgotten. I understand mistakes are going to be made, we are only human. But every time? It shouldn't be every time. And if it's too busy, maybe it's time to hire more people. Instead of having an ex employee stand outside cussing telling people to not go in.... all I'm saying.  Anyways. We pay good money for the food there, always tip the servers well. And I'm starting to feel like instead of driving 10 minutes to our local, we should drive 25 to the one in Springfield. Springfield is always understanding, always excited to greet us. The server is always wonderful. Food is always great. The managers are always on the floor talking to customers. I've never once let alone, seen a manager at Potomac Mills.  None the less, we went again tonight. It was rather busy.

Overall, my experience was great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-woodbridge,1.68,1.81,1.81,,1.7580000000000002

76,Keeyhla R.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,21,,2.0,2018-01-02,"I have no clue what has happened to this Friday's location, but the food is not as good as it used to be. I have been visiting this location for over 7 years and have seen a drastic decline in cooks ability. The times I have visited the staff have generally been professional, except the time I got my purse stolen. Altogether, I will drive miles to another Friday's location or simply choose another restaurant over this particular location now. ( Only was able to credit 2 stars because the majority of employees that have serviced me were great)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-woodbridge,1.72,1.81,1.81,,1.7740000000000002
