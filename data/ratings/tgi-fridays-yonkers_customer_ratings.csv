174,Jaquie R.,"Bronx, NY",0,3,,1.0,2012-01-28,"This is by far the worst TGI Fridays I have been to. Most of the staff is extremely rude and unprofessional. The first time we went our waiter was very nice. The second time we has a waitress who took 30 minutes to take our  orders. We waited about 50 minutes for our appetizer to come out and 10 minutes later our food came out cold. That same day their ""system"" was down and we received hand written checks that took another 40 minutes to get. At no point was our waitress or the boss supportive of the situation. She would walk by the table and not even ask if we needed anything.  The third time I decided to go, the ""hostesses"" in the front were extremely rude and literally yelling when asking us a party of how many and if we would stay...I must say Fridays doesn't have the best service but this by far is the worst.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yonkers?start=160,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052

191,nasanta n.,"New York, NY",1,34,,2.0,2012-10-10,"It was a crowded Saturday evening, and a party of three was pleasantly surprised to find their estimated 15 minutes wait cut down to less than 10. The server was pleasant and friendly. The wait for the meals was a bit long. The alcoholic mango drink that one of the party ordered tasted watered down with only a faint taste of mango. The requested medium rare rib eye was not as rare as that one in the party liked, but she liked the sauce. The other two in the party did not care for the sauce. The potato strips with a sour cheesy sauce were pretty good, and so were the vegetables. The fries were a bit salty but still good. A second rib eye dish was ordered with a specific request to make it medium rare a bit rarer. Another long wait, and the server was less attentive, busy with the other customers. The second rib eye dish - well, it was practically a disaster. The vegetables were way too salty. The potato strips barely had any of the cheese sauce on it. And the rib eye? Despite the request to make it rarer, it was more on the medium well done side. At least a third of it was plain fat. And the sauce that the one had liked was practically nonexistent. When the server finally came to ask if all was satisfactory, a polite complaint was made. The party had had a coupon that would have made the cheaper rib dish free. Instead, the second rib eye dish was free. At least that was something. For the writer, the establishment gets 2 stars. She would not mind coming back. For that one?

First off, I ordered a margarita and when I got this watered down margarita, but given that a lot of restaurants water down their alcoholic drinks I didn't  make a big fuss about it. My problem was with my waiter, my friend and I ordered the 2 for 10 with the entree and appetizer after 20mins of waiting some chick (not our waiter) brings out the entree,  were like ""where is the appetizer? That's suppose to come first"" She said ""oh you want me to bring it back?"" No! Sweetie just bring the appetizer out and we will eat both.. 5mins later our waiter comes out saying ""I didn't even kno they brought out the food"" fast forward after laughs with my friend, some other waiter brings out the check, that we never asked for and what made it funny was that the check that she gave us wasn't even ours! Then when we are ready to leave, our waiter is too busy flirting with the other table to give us our check and take our money so that we can leave. We waited 20 mins for him to take out our check..

I ordered a Jack Daniels Shrimp and Chicken, my girlfriend ordered the Flatiron steak. My meal was good, however, I was most impressed with the Flatiron steak my girlfriend ordered. She had asked for a medium steak and that is exactly what she got. I was shocked, she was shocked that at a place like TGIF, the cook or whomever was in the kitchen could actually do this so well.

A couple of employee's passed the group by clearly no concern for their business or any kind or a tip. After the girl returns she never apologizes for making us wait. She then starts walking really fast like she being chased to seat us.She never welcomes us to fridays makes eyes contact or nothing. She seats us at a table that was dirty and broken.

The food came out & there was a long wait for the drinks; when we finally received the drinks they looked horrible the strawberry margarita came out white with red at the bottom of the cup as if she blended up the margarita mix and then just poured red at the bottom the same for the blue margarita all white with blue and red at the bottom all my times of visiting multiple Fridays I've never had my drinks look like that I get this drink all the time. I complained the manger RAFFEAL remade the drink he obviously didn't kno how too this time my drink came out PURPLE!!! How in the world is my drink purple I've never felt so insulted he told me when the drink is on the rocks it's blue but frozen it's purple that make no sense he argued with me infringing of other employees and guest how professional of him. I wish I could insert the pictures of the drinks.

What she failed to mention was that it was $10 per item. At no point during her explanations did she explain that!  So when our bill came, it was $50 in appetizers. We asked to speak to the manager, and he was of no help. Completely clueless on how to handle the situation.  He tried to school us on the deal, and we told him to school his staff instead. They clearly need management to educate them on offers, and how to give good service. Food was nasty, and greasy. Boneless wings were soggy and had a sickening neon orange color.

Service is very dependent on the bartender or waiter that you get.  There is a handful that are exemplary. One that even has my beers ready when she sees me coming in.  One security guard recognizes me as a regular and always finds a seat for me by the bar.  There are definitely ""safe bet"" appetizers you can order. The wings with the bone are good,  ask for the jack Daniels sauce on the side for a tasty tangy twist. Mozzarella sticks vary by the day. Happy Hour (10pm-close everday, all day on sunday) is the best time to go. Later at night and on the weekends can get busy and finding a place by the bar can be difficult.

We overlooked it, reminded him that I also asked for honey mustard as well and he brought the mash out right away. 20 minutes later he brought out my husbands other appetizer. I placed my order a little later than my husband and son but there is no way appetizers were taking so long. At this point I assume a friend of his came to visit so he not only talked to her but he also sat at their table. He then got up walked passed our table pivot... looked at the table went to the back and brought it out immediately. Still no honey mustard. I then asked for to go containers because we had been there for so long. He brought it out to us. If a table is asking for to go containers then you may want to bring the bill as well. Instead we waited another 15 minutes just for him to come back to the table and bring it. He then continued to converse and my husband ended up taking the bill to him.  Worst Service Ever.

102,Rebecca B.,"Bronx, NY",4,63,9.0,2.0,2015-03-30,"This TGIF location gives franchises a bad name.  It's in a busy mall complex (Cross County) and it has a strong brand name... so they are always busy. The fact that they have a built in base of customers at the mall has allowed them to perform on a sub-par level and not see repercussions to their business.  Let me just start with the line.  We were there about 4pm on a Sunday afternoon and we were told the wait was ""about 25 minutes.""  OK fine.  The waiting area was filled up with people and even people waiting in the vestibule and outside (in the cold!).  We went inside to use the bathroom and saw that there were TONS of empty tables throughout the place.  Many of them sitting with dirty dishes on them which weren't bussed for 10-30 minutes!  There were more than enough tables to accommodate everyone in the waiting area.  It is either a case of poor time management or understaffing a busy location on a weekend, or most likely both.  Now on to the service.  While we could see all these empty tables, many waiting to be bussed, at any one time there were 2-6 staff members hovering around the hostess stand.  One was the hostess, one was the girl who seats tables.  Then anywhere from 1-3 waitstaff were standing around there talking with the hostess.  And a tall man in a suit who appeared to be a manager but I'm really not sure because I didn't see him managing.   We had a waiter station near our table and several times there were 2-3 waitresses standing there talking for minutes at a time.  Also, when I went into the ladies room, a waitress was standing in there texting on her phone. No wonder they couldn't fill all the tables - all their servers were TOO BUSY to be serving them! The food... We had 3 burgers and a steak.  The burgers were pretty tasty.  The fries definitely old and soggy, which was a shame because they looked like they would have been great if they were fresh.  The steak was pretty good too, not Peter Luger but better than I expected at Fridays.  One burger we ordered was the Philly burger - we asked for it without bacon and bacon jam (?!?) and when it arrived it looked nothing like the picture (I know, no food ever looks like the picture but this was ridiculous.)  We check it and realize that they didn't put the philly steak between the two patties - the entire point of the Philly burger!  So we had to send it back and ask for a new one.  That was kind of a pain but our waiter James did get a new one, properly made, and it looked MUCH better and tasted good too.   Our waiter, James, was actually pretty good, I have no complaints about him.  Friendly and fairly attentive.  I'd recommend he gets a job in a more reputable establishment because this one is managed terribly!   Oh, one other plus, they had half price appetizers so we got two orders of Buffalo wings for the price of one.  I'd give the wings a B+ but definitely worth what we paid for them.

111,James F.,"Yonkers, NY",0,13,2.0,1.0,2016-02-01,"This is, quite possibly, the worst TGIF I've ever been to.  I understand that not everybody can be happy all the time, but part of your job, working at a restaurant, is to be pleasant to your customers.  1. The hostess sat customers who arrived after I did. When I made mention of it, they explained that they were on the list, pointed it out, and basically proved that they were on the list after me. Then, I was seated immediately.  2. There were many available tables, yet the waiting area was filled with people. When a customer asked why there were so many tables, but no one being seated, she explained that they didn't want to seat anyone while the kitchen was backed up. So, basically, the kitchen staff couldn't keep up with a restaurant that wasn't even filled with people.  3. Cleanliness. Although, I had been seated, we noticed that the table behind us hadn't been cleaned off yet. It stayed that way for about a half an hour.  4. Waiting staff was inattentive. We finished our drinks and appetizers and we sat with empty cups, and plates for quite some time. When the waiter did remove our empty plates, he just moved them to the next empty table, instead of bringing them to get cleaned.  5. The wait for the entree took nearly 40 minutes. I ordered Cheddar Mac n cheese as a side. It was basically macaroni covered in grated Parmesan cheese. The garlic steak fries were only about 5 fries covered in some kind of sauce, and the bourbon chicken was just a small piece of chicken with seasoning on it. Not bourbon.  The person I went with got lobster tail and steak. The steak, lobster, and mashed were all cold. After waiting as long as we did for our food, that meal should have been immaculate. He was so angry, he sent the food back, and the waiter didn't even apologize.  The manager came and expressed his apologies, but did very little to make sure we'd leave feeling better about the situation.  6. All else failed, we went to Red Lobster, where my buddy got a fulfilling meal, piping hot, and I got my dessert there.

After the service we went to IHOP but the wait was over an hr. We called TGiFridays on central ave and asked how long was the wait for a party of 13 and they said they would be able to accommodate us right away. When we got there the service was prompt and our servers were extremely courteous. The food came out hot which is great considering it was so many of us. The mozzarella sticks were crispy on the outside and warm and cheesy on the inside. My rum punch was awesome as well. Last but not least I had stripes rewards which I was having a hard time redeeming. I was going back and forth with the general customer service number so I decided to call the TGiFridays and see if anyone there could help me since customer service was no help. I spoke to the manager, Danny, and he was awesome. I told him what my issue was ... And he actually cared!!  He told me not to worry that he was going to do all he could to get my stripes and within 30 min it was done.

90,Dana M.,"Yonkers, NY",2,37,20.0,2.0,2016-02-22,"Went here today for the first time, around 2pm... Quiet, not busy at all! Place was clean except the seats in the booths were all ripped! The hostess tried to seat us in a booth where the sun would be shining directly in your eyes, something that would not be fun while trying to enjoy your meal! When I asked her if we could be seated else where (mind you only 2 other tables were taken at that time in the same area) she rolled her eyes and made a ""annoyed"" sigh!! Really?!? Sorry did not realize all of your tables were taken!  To the food, tried the endless apps, which are 12$ per person! Not ""just"" 12$ as advertised every where, but ok no big deal they were good!  Decided to have a burger today, try one of their new ones, the New Smoke Stacked Burger! It did not look anything like how it was pictured in menu (which can be understandable)... But unfortunately it was missing a few of the listed ingredients!! These are the ingredients listed in their menu : ""Beer-braised sausage & onions, Asiago & cheddar between two fresh hickory-smoked burgers with sweet Memphis seasoning, melted sharp cheddar, Tennessee BBQ sauce, BBQ ranch aioli, applewood-smoked bacon and coleslaw.""..... The two patties have to be well done, you do not get a choice! The sausage tasted like a cheap sausage from dunkin donuts, and was very small! I had no onions on mine but I guess they made up for it with the one pickle they did throw in it!  To the service- our server Ceana, was not good at all!!! Could not recommend a good burger to try, everything she said was ""eh its pretty good, I like it, its ok, people order it""... Nothing truly special or something to rave about! Not good when their own employees can not say anything impressive about the food... She did sell the endless app, threw in the $12 each thing at the end while I was already ordering so we barely heard her, and honestly were confused by the way she was trying to explain it... Simple! For 12$ each person you get to choose from 6 or how ever many options and have endless refills... Not to hard! Also, never once did she come to see how we were doing or if we needed anything! We had to get up several times to find her! She had us and one other table in our section, and that couple was waiting just as long as we were and left just unhappy as we did!  Another thing- they were training a new young girl and 2 tables away from us, a female and male were yelling at her and made the poor girl cry! IN FRONT OF ALL THE CUSTOMERS! What kinda employer does that?!? Go to a private area to have a discussion, do not do that in front of paying customers!  So at the end of our meal, we were in a happy agreement that this will not be a place we will be going back to!

Our waitress, after 10 minutes, told us she would be with us. She was putting in a bill right next to us, chatting with about three other co-workers. One waitress, who has a shaved head, was on her phone the whole time. I am pretty sure she was still on her shift. Regardless, it took FOREVER to place our order. We waited another 10 minutes for sodas. We then waited a half hour for our burgers. The customers around us were not pleased either. Some of the staff worked their butts off, yet the ones around us today were terrible. At one point, one of the cooks and a lady in a red shirt (not sure if that means she is a manager) went outside, while we were waiting, to see ""their friend"". As a person who was worked in customer service for a few years now, this is not acceptable. Luckily, the seasoned fries were good. I made my own burger, and I asked for it medium well. It came out pretty rare, but it was a decent burger. I will not be coming back to this location. At a time where it was not busy at all, the staff failed to serve. I suggest trying out the locations in Scarsdale, where I had a pleasant experience. Also, I love how NONE of the managers noticed the slow service. Do they not care?

She then goes to say that, customers, along with employees are constantly telling the manager it's cold, and he does nothing. She said he was trying to save money on the heat bill. Ummm really?

First let me say that we were seated in the bar area. When I tell you that the waitress behaved like she didn't want to be there that would be an understatement. We ordered our food and drinks. First of all, she slammed the small plates with napkins on the table. The delivery of the drinks was with the same attitude. Lets not talk about the delivery of the food - we waited and waited and waited and waited. People that came in after us received their food and we were still waiting. The waitress never came back to say anything - at first I thought she went home. I had to ask another waiter to go get my waitress and my goodness she really had no personality. She definitely wasn't trained in customer service. When I inquired about my food order she stated that it was coming - I was saying it's almost an hour. If I wasn't hungry I would have left. When my food finally arrived I really didn't want it but I tried to make the best of it. When it came time for the check I just looked on the handheld device that they had on the table and got my total and called her over and paid in cash. When I think about it I should have used my debit card on that device and paid and left I'm sure she wouldn't have noticed that we left.

First off - it took about 30 mins before we were seated. We had a party of 3: 2 adults + 1 child, it didn't look as though they were very busy, but what I could tell is that all of the staff seemed to look as though they were all very confused and stressed. The looks on their faces expressed that fully. After being seated by the host, we sat at our table for another 15 minutes without a waiter/waitress ever coming by.  A busboy passed by and I had to ask him if he could please send a manager over. When the manager arrived I let him know that we'd been sitting unattended for some time and he had to find someone to cover our table. Long story short: we made simple orders without any substitutions - in fear of them getting messed up, seeing as how the table right next to us seemed to be having difficulties with their order, nevertheless our order still managed to come out messed up and flavorless, even down to the dessert we ordered. Not to mention, while waiting for our food to come, we were approached 4 times by different servers with other orders, asking if we had ordered them. I don't know who this particular location is owned and run by but there is definitely a lack of everything.. I'm scared to even give this location another try.

We waited about 10 minutes for our drinks, which was the only good thing we had. We were never given glasses of water, even though I asked for some. We then waited about 40 minutes for our entrees (the floor was not busy). The table next to us seemed to have been going through the same wait, since they stood up and left when the food finally did arrive, without touching/eating anything. The presentation was terrible, we both ordered the steak and lobster. I ordered mine with broccoli and she didn't tell me there wasn't any until she brought the dish out with only mashed potatoes.

33,Lovely L.,"Yonkers, NY",0,6,1.0,1.0,2017-09-02,"Not sure why I keep giving this place a chance. So let's start by saying... staff here definitely need training. Last time I came our server wanted to joke around with other staff instead of tending to our table(which took him 25mins to even acknowledge us)... this time around the sarcastic server lacks proper training yet again.... professionally. Bless her heart she tried. But word to the wise do not refer to a woman as ""sweetie"" or ""honey"" and her date as ""sir"" and ""mister"". Bad look and quite disrespectful. DRINKS-- I indicated what drink I wanted (a drink that the very helpful bartender always makes for me) welp when ready the recipe the server tells me oh I don't know about this and that she's not sure how to ring it out. I explained I had it before. She leaves and returns to indicate ""let's just go with a safe route"" and presumes to place an order for another drink. 25 minutes later. Still no drink. When they finally came the pineapple mojito taste like medicine and the passion fruit tea was someone's creation gone SO WRONG. Any question on why the long wait... well we watched Meanwhile as the bartender assigned to make drinks for the servers flirts instead of works. FOOD -- oh it will come out hot. OUTSIDE. Inside. Not so much. When I placed my order for my food and made the adjustments needed she told me I couldn't do it become they don't accommodate such needs anymore. Well what do you guys do?!? Not to mention the food came out before the drinks and of course the order was not correct. Burgers were bland and rare when I clearly ordered medium well!!!! As we sat patiently waiting for our food. We watched as 4 staff members attempted to pick something floating out of a customers drink before bring it to the table (see attached photo)All this to avoid making another drink. I think the only thing they managed to do right was sing happy birthday for a staff member. This place needs serious help.

I requested some sauce and the girl that came over said they don't do that here with a little bit of an attitude (let it go) and asked for nieces extra fries.

He asked to speak to the manager and was very upset.
