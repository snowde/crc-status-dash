202,Alaina J.,"East Greenbush, NY",102,137,51.0,5.0,2012-01-05,"A couple of years ago, I would not have given this place above three stars, due to the slow, unimpressive service and the mediocre food that came in giant portions.  I actually refused to go here for quite awhile, and then one day my husband and I were at the mall and got hungry and figured, what the hell, we'd give it another shot.  I'm very glad we did.  For the past year I've had nothing but really outstanding service, and I haven't had a single dish I didn't like.  They have a catfish special quite often that is absolutely freaking delicious, especially considering how hard it is to find good catfish in upstate NY.  The small plates are fantastic, and it's easy to have a light but diverse meal without a whole lot of calories.  I really recommend this place, especially if you were once turned off by bad service or food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-albany?start=200,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.772,3.1200000000000006
126,Sara V.,"Seattle, WA",349,159,1200.0,3.0,2012-04-28,"Dinner food is all right, try it once for the experience then just stop by here if you ever want a cheese cake. All cheesecake factory restaurants seem to have the same decor, but I'm usually impressed by these things anyways so I ogled at the little statues and furniture everywhere. When I went here with five other friends, we were seated in a circular booth with a big table with mirrors behind us. It was really cool. The ambiance here is nice, but it's very very loud. You will always hear the drone of other patrons and the clacking of dishes non-stop. You will always have to wait to come here even if you make a reservation. I wasn't too happy with my server. Every time he came to the table, he said his name and repeated his question to everyone. ""Hello, my name is ___. What would you like to drink? Hello, my name is __. What would you like to drink?"" I don't know if he had a short term memory loss issue, but it freaked me out. Halfway through my meal, we got another waiter. Either the other guy was fired on the spot or something happened to him. I didn't know who to tip at this point, so as we were leaving, we split the tip in half and put it in two different piles. Coincidentally, both waiters had the same name. I remembered because the first guy said his name over ten times. The food re-heats up okay. I wouldn't do it more than once or eat it more than 2 days after you go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-albany?start=120,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.476,3.1200000000000006
222,Alexandra T.,"Latham, NY",0,4,,1.0,2012-05-04,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory on Wednesday, May 2 2012 for my brother's birthday dinner. I have celiac disease and cannot eat anything with gluten in it without becoming very sick. When I first went in, I asked the hostess for a gluten free menu; she said that they did not have one, but that my server would be happy to offer suggestions from the regular menu. Our server, Amy, came to the table, and I explained to her that I had celiac and that I would need suggestions as to what could be made gluten free. She told me that I should pick out a few things from the menu, and she would check in the back and see whether or not they could be made gluten free. I selected five different things, and she wrote them down and went in the back to check on them. She came back about five minutes later and explained whether or not each item could be prepared gluten free. I chose the Baja Chicken Tacos, which she told me I could eat as long as I did not have the salsa, rice, or beans. I was happy to have something delicious to eat, and we left her a $40 tip for being so helpful and accommodating. After dinner, I started to feel very sick, with stomach cramps and spasms through my entire abdominal cavity, and diarrhea. My sister called the restaurant, and the manager told her that the chicken in my tacos was marinated in a flour-based sauce. He told her that there was nothing that he could do for us, and we would have to wait to hear from their Risk Services department. She called back less than two minutes later to ask for our generous tip back, and the hostess told her that the manager had left for the night without even looking for him. As she had just gotten off the phone with the manager, this was an obvious lie, and the hostess begrudgingly went to look for him. He told her that should could come in the next day to get our tip back, but that there was nothing else that he could do. The next day, my sister went to pick up our tip, as I was still too sick to go myself. She was told that the waitress had only claimed a $20 tip on our table, so that was all that he could give her. This was a blatant lie, and it is insulting to insinuate that my family would leave only $20 when our bill was $188. Again, she was told that there was nothing he could do about it. She also tried calling their corporate office, but was given the same answer. No one in this company is willing to apologize or take responsibility for their negligence. Food allergies are a serious thing, and I am lucky that I only became violently ill and was not killed; if I had a peanut or egg allergy, I would be dead. They need to take responsibility for educating their staff. I want to make sure that this story is out there because I don't want anyone else to suffer like I did. I am still waiting for a resolution for this issue.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-albany?start=220,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.212,2.96
174,Tracy P.,"Brooklyn, NY",62,213,292.0,1.0,2012-07-23,"This was my first visit to the Cheese Cake Factory it's true what they say "" you never get a second chance to make a first impression"". With that being said the drinks were ok nothing to brag about the Long Island Iced Tea could have been much stronger. The J.W.'s Lemonade could also have been much stronger it basically tasted like a juice instead of a cocktail.  The appetizers were good the choices were Crab Wontons and Fried Macaroni and cheese.  The only thing I would change is the sauce that comes with the wontons it seems out of place and doesn't compliment the dish.  Entrees were a complete disaster presentation was a zero and taste was non existent. The chicken and shrimp jambalaya with linguini came highly recommended it was a total let down. It looked like a bunch of pasta and peppers tossed together and then up chucked into a plate. The second entree was the pepper shrimp and chicken with plantains, white rice and black beans with a few pieces of pineapple for decoration. This dish was sad the chef didn't take the time to devein the shrimp. Long story short it was discarded before we left the restaurant. The cheesecake factory has a massive menu, which leaves a big chance that executing many of these dishes will fail. I have no plans on visiting this chain again. The place was clean service was decent but the main courses flunked the test. I didn't try any cheesecake I just couldn't accept 1550 calories in a single slice of red velvet cheese cake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-albany?start=140,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.34,2.88

120,Soleil S.,"Mississauga, Canada",517,707,2463.0,3.0,2012-10-07,"I was dragged here for a business dinner and I was dreading every moment. I was already warned by others that this is the epitome of American chain foods. Huge portions, unhealthy, haphazard service, and obnoxious flavourings.  I guess you can say 'large and in charge'. When I arrived, I was surprised. It wasn't as bad as people make it out to be and the service was actually good. It's already been said but the menu is a novel. I've never seen anything like it. It's all over the map as well. Asian this, southern that, deep fried this, comfort food that, and a decent throw in of healthy food.    Seeing we are at the Cheesecake Factory, I made calorie room for that. I shared the chicken lettuce wrap appetizer with the table and had the seared tuna entree. The service was pretty good. The waitress was friendly and the dinner pace was quick. We never waited for anything. Drinks were constantly refreshed and our table of 8 was looked after for everything. The food quality and taste didn't rock my world but it didn't leave me gagging either. The chicken lettuce wrap had fresh vegetables and nothing wilting. The chicken was slightly dried out and yet a bit oily at the same time.  The seared tuna entree was 'healthy' portioned. The tuna quality was ok. It wasn't great sashimi grade and buttery soft. It had a bit of tough chew to it.  The sear did impart a nice smokiness to it.   As for the cheesecakes, dear lawd, thank goodness we shared because they're incredibly indulgent. Rich, creamy, and I'm sure high in calories. Probably the best part of the meal. We tried the Godiva, blueberry, apple strudel, tiramisu, and the Oreo. The tiramisu was my favourite. Great coffee flavour and it wasn't brick dense. The Godiva one was really good too though you need to be a chocolate lover. The blueberry actually tasted of blueberries instead of fake sugary blueberry jam. I wasn't a fan of the apple but then again, apple pies are not my thing. The Oreo was like a candy bar. True to the cookie taste but it was sugar overload. I don't think I'd come here on my own again but if I'm dragged here, I wouldn't fear for my taste buds. I'd just fear for my waistline.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-albany?start=120,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.636,2.92

Oh, over priced food that takes another 40 minutes to reach you, 10-15$ drinks with half a shot of liquor in them if you are lucky and a loud ass venue with mostly screaming kids and annoying familes talking hella loud about shit you dont need to hear. You literally have every option out there food wise and culture wise in Albany so it baffles me that this place is always poppin.  But then again its filled with your typical LL Bean white folk who are petrified to try any spice besides garlic.  Mostly freshman families who have yet to discover the array of cool ass stuff in and around albany, and just want some reliable chain BS. GAG.  I refuse to go here anymore and while the food is ok and has decent size portions, I am all about tryng new and small locally owned restaurants.  I beg all of you to steer clear of this trap.  Wolf road alone has so many other places to try that won't make you wait over an hour for some grub.  And if you need a date spot, try downtown  or even better Lark Street.  Drinks are nicer and you can get three for the price of one drink downtown.  I'm sold in that fact alone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-albany?start=100,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.504,2.88

160,Kathy C.,"Voorheesville, NY",19,7,3.0,3.0,2013-05-21,"About two months ago we went here and I fell in love with one of their pasta dishes.  I've never been a big fan of the place because it's noisy and the food is just ok, nothing in the past that would have me waiting an hour for it. We decided to do dinner out the night before Mothers Day, instead of on the actual day.  Got there about 8, still had an hour wait (I would say not their fault, but...), then waited another 45 minutes for our meal, with one stop by the manager made to tell us ours was about to come out.  We didn't have appetizers, just the main meal. Our waiter was a nice guy, doing the best that he could really.   Kept our drinks filled, brought us the bread basket quickly (thank goodness!).  When our meals finally came, my pasta was had just enough sauce to say there was sauce on it, certainly not enough to give you all the flavor of the dish.  My daughters chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce had about a quarter size spot of sauce on it, and what they brought her for more was just watery hot sauce.  My sons club sandwich was burned on one side, but not so bad that it was inedible, but definitely burned.  My husband and other son had minor issues with their meals as well.  So for over $100 bill, we had a 2 hr wait - again, if the kitchen wasn't clearly behind the wait would have been less, so while I won't hold it completely against the place, it wasn't just a busy time we hit either, and poorly made food.

The menu selection is very diverse with options of pasta to burgers. On my visit I had a turkey burger which came with the choice of fries or a small caesar side salad. My fiancé had the buffalo chicken burger. Now in the past at places I've ate, the burgers have been your average run of the mill frozen patty. But with this one it was obvious that it was a fresh pressed patty. Very plump and juicy, full of flavor, served a freshly toasted bun. On the side was a great garlic aioli. With the buffalo chicken sandwich, it was very visible that the chicken was fresh split a chicken breast that was coated and fried. Before we left we peeked at the desert menu, because honestly you can't go to the Cheesecake Factory and not want to at least look at the variety of the cheesecakes available. We both agreed on picking up a slice of tiramisu cheesecake. Of course we got it to go. But once we got home and had shared the slice, it was DELICIOUS!!

Most entrees are loaded with so much salt it ruins the taste as its all you taste. Their prices for alcohol and mixed drinks are so ridiculous they should supply a complimentary jar of vasoline with them because they are f**king the consumer when it comes to drinks. $8 for a domestic beer and $10 and up for a mixed drink is too expensive when the cup is 80% ice. I honestly don't know how people can think its good food....its below average but their portions are plentiful...that about all I can say that is positive. Their prices are slightly higher than normal for a chain restaurant.

After looking at what Albany had to offer we decided to check this place out. I've personally never been to one before but it was a pleasant experience. I was given a per diem of $35 and since this was our only stop of the day I decided let's just be silly and use it all. Heck, I wasn't paying for it. I started off with the Buffalo poppers and they were greatly enjoyable. Basically chicken and cheese bits fried in what seemed to be some kind of tortilla shell with a side of buffalo dipping sauce. For my main course I chose the Fried Cajun Chicken. It came with a side of mashed potatoes, which were excellent, and then I substituted some fries in. I'm sorry to say I just didn't get the Cajun feel. They seemed like some slightly seasoned chicken tenders. The overall portions were hugs and all the meals we had were take home meals, because none of use could finish them. Now I may have commuted a sin, but I didn't order cheese cake. I know, crazy, right? But I had already maxed out what I was allowed and I'm not that found of cheesecake. Our waitress, who seemed to be new, was pretty slow. We waited quite a while to get or checks and for my colleagues to get their slices of cake. Now if a place is crazy busy, I don't blame the server, I understand how it can be.

37,Steve N.,"Albany, NY",164,381,697.0,4.0,2015-10-12,"Ask yourself this question, and then think about the answer for a few moments. If The Cheesecake Factory is as mediocre as most yelp reviews claim it is, why is it always packed? Not just packed, but has hours long waits at times?  If you're not sure, let me help you with some possible answers. Everyone's cousin dragged them there because said cousin loves: ""Portions big enough to choke an elephant!"", even though they know he has poor taste in food, and thinks the breadsticks at the Olive Garden are ""The bomb"". They're in Colonie Center, and are hungry, but they're too lazy to take the elevator up to the food court, and the giant horse in front of that Chinese place frightened their 3 year old. They have an English exam the next day and decide to read through the entire 27 pages of the menu as prep for the exam. They're in training to become the worlds fattest person, so they order two of the many entrees that are more than 2000 calories each and eat all of it. OK, bad jokes aside, why, despite a completely mediocre 3 star rating is the place always freaking mobbed? This may be hard for some to understand, so pay close attention. Cheesecake Factory is always packed because...  THE FOOD IS GOOD. Yep, it's that simple. And I don't care what the negative reviews claim, the food is made from scratch, and is better than most every other chain restaurant you can name. In fact, The Cheesecake Factory is the best casual dining chain in the country. Period, dot dot. End of argument. Is everything on the menu awesome? No, of course not, but that doesn't mean most dishes aren't good, and some are very good, and when you discover one of those amazing dishes, you'll be hooked for life. Ignore the naysayers who love to hate on the Cheesecake Factory. Go, and start with one of the popular dishes, which are popular for good reason, and then come back to Yelp, and set the record straight.  The Cheesecake Factory makes fresh, delicious food. Plus there's something on the menu for absolutely any palate. And don't fret over the portion sizes.

99,Krista R.,"Albany, NY",57,177,293.0,2.0,2016-03-09,"I generally avoid the Cheesecake Factory because it is almost always packed (not unlike the Olive Garden, which I also avoid), the food is not belly or wallet friendly, and we almost always get seated at the banquette, which I despise. I feel as if I'm eating inches away from total strangers at those dreaded tables. A large portion of the restaurant is comprised of banquette seating, too, so unless you're with a large party, this is probably where you'll end up. Having said all that, my husband and I went to TCF for dinner last night, mainly because we had received a $25 gift card through a raffle. Seated at the banquette (grrrr), we each ordered a drink from the Happy Hour menu. We had no complaints about the beverages. For dinner I ordered the country salad from the Skinnylicious menu, and subbed tomatoes for the beets. I was shocked to see that I was charged for this. I was substituting a menu item, not adding one, and it's not as if tomatoes are expensive. My husband ordered the chicken pasta and instead received chicken tacos. I guess ""pasta"" sounded like ""tacos"" to the waitress. In her defense, his voice probably could not be heard over the tremendous din in the restaurant; it is always very loud in there because of the enormously high, smooth ceilings. She offered to take it back but my husband accepted the tacos to make things easier. So, in some minor and major ways, we were not entirely pleased with our meals. It was not terrible, and it was not great. It was just lackluster, in a handful of ways. Ultimately, the Cheesecake Factory is sort of like an upscale Ruby Tuesday, but at least RT has the salad bar and has its prices under control. Unless we receive another gift card, I doubt we'll be coming back. There are just better places to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-albany?start=80,3.16,3.05,3.05,2.056,3.094

101,Chris B.,"Red Hook, NY",7,825,459.0,5.0,2016-03-25,"I'm surprised by this business. Up until yesterday, I had never went into a cheesecake factory store due in part to hearing that prices were much higher than the average price of cheesecake elsewhere. When going in, I saw their display case for their ""take home"" line of products to order from.  I knew they were a little expensive, so I planned accordingly. From three longer shelves, I picked one that I felt good enough to order (with my Irritable Bowel Syndrome (which the richness of most cheesecake's affect me) and all).  I looked and the one that struck me was the ""Snickers Bar Cheesecake"" which was sitting on what appeared to be the same plate of cheesecake as the Hershey Chocolate Bar cheesecake. ""Oh boy,"" I thought. And I definitely was in for a treat on the rest of the order - but little did I know that their ""Take out menu"" featured an even larger selection of cheesecake and other cakes. It took a few minutes for the last person in line to finish their order and receive it. But I Made it after a few minutes. Things went smoothly, and the employee took my order.  She joked with me a little.  Although I could never read minds, I could tell that she could tell that this was my first time into one when I asked for that piece.  The last person had ordered several cheesecake pies and I seriously thought to ask if they even sold them ""by the piece"" (which I sort-of half knew before I asked anything)?   The rest of the order here went off without a hitch. The cheesecake was so de-licious that I can't even describe it without loosing that specific styling that only a cheesecake factory location would impart. Thank you.  I'm surprised. Yes, it cost me a little more than $8.50 to savor this cheesecake, but it was definitely worth it in the end.  But be careful with their selection of cheesecakes on their shelves, some aren't even cheesecakes themselves - such as the Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake (which someone in my party actually tried on a second trip into the establishment, but that's not something I'm commenting on). I hated not giving them a tip on my bill, but I had some quarters on me.  For the wonderful time I had, I had to give them some money for the wonderful service and great product. Personally, seeing their prices, I don't think I'll ever eat here for other products that they sell here, but the cheesecake was so good, I'm coming back in a few months.  Keep up the great work and the great products!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-albany?start=100,3.28,3.07,3.07,2.388,3.154
67,Ben I.,"Albany, NY",2,14,,1.0,2016-04-11,"If you're thinking of going here and you're picky enough to read reviews...click on somewhere better.  First impression : place is gigantic, packed, noisy, and looks like a casino floor. Half an hour wait to be seated. Is it really so great, or is it location, location...anchor store right in the center or colonie center with a big sign facing the parking lot. I've never been here despite holding a gift card to the place for 2+ years.  My hopes are very low.  The best I can imagine is a 'good' chain like recovery room, but when cheesecake is your main claim to fame I am not even expecting that much.  We're seated. Server immediately arrives and asks if we know what we want. The menus are sitting untouched on the table still.  Not the most observant chap. We get things going.  I skip the apps, although several options sound good.  I am hoping not to spend 'real' money here still. I ordered fish and chips.  I figure that's pretty easy for a place like this, maybe they'll have a decent offering. My dining companion goes for huevos rancheros. Sadly, no.  One can get a better fish and chips at mcdonalds for less than 1/3 the $19 this disappointing option set us back.  First problem, it wasnt one large piece of fish, or even large-ish pieces. They were small, factory-reject looking pieces. Glistening with greasy sweat, too, with the batter torn off some pieces from mishandling.  One step down and you'd basically have gortons fish sticks here, poorly perpared fish sticks to boot. The flavor - was nonexistent, just the taste of fried flour and the blandest whitefish. I'm not even sure if they put salt and pepper in the batter...the tiny cup of tartar sauce is quickly drained. For a 20 bill, I can't even get a legit portion of tartar sauce?! What kind of barbaric establishment is this?     But how about those chips!? Who doesnt love fries - and a popular place like this must have decent fries, right?  Wrong.  They're edible, but bland. Again, I'm left wondering if this could even stand up against fast food fries. Bleh. Like eating fried cardboard, flavorles, dull, stale.  The coleslaw, predictably, was a fail too.  My counterpart's mexican eggs look somewhat better, (and by better, I mean like something edible a grade schooler might put together) but I don't hear any rants and raves about how good it is. It's basically eggs unceremoniously plopped on a tortilla with some can black beans underneath. Oooh, but there's a couple avocado slices! Wow!  I could put this whole thing together in a couple minutes for probably a dollar a plate.  We skip the cheesecake.  It's easy enough to make and kind of just a boring, filling option. I'm sure it's outrageously overpriced. Which seems to describe this place well overall.  To sum up - crowded, loud, long wait, boring, flavorless, filling, overpriced.  I imagine the food comes from some kind of bland gluten machine in the back which presses ""food"" into various shapes and sprays a skin on it after to make it look like food, which providing the cheapest factory fill-u-up calories possible.  Needless to say, I won't ever be going back to one of these.  It baffles and troubles me that many other people line up to eat here, but that seems to be the way of the world.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-albany?start=60,3.2,3.07,3.07,1.956,3.122

The Baja chicken tacos were superb, I also had the chicken samosas as an appetizer. Although they didn't taste much like samosas (an Indian appetizer) they tasted more like a fried dumpling.

57,Jane A.,"Albany, NY",0,7,3.0,2.0,2017-01-22,"Pissed off beyond belief this specific night. My friends and I were given a beeper and told the wait was 50-70 minutes. My friends and I  waited AT LEAST an hour and 45 minutes,before we had enough and left! as we watched people get seated that came 10 minutes after us and only waited 5 minutes! Not fair!  I do not understand what goes thru people's minds! how is it fair that people who wait 2 hours are ignored while people can walk in and be seated in 10 minutes!?!?! The place was humid and hot and I got a horrible migraine. I put the beeper down and walked out to an Indian restaurant around the area,I was pissed. Another thing that pissed me off was the fact that able bodied men were sitting in the waiting area! I saw no woman sitting down and no child sitting down! I do not know how it doesnt bother a 30-50 yr old guy sitting down with his legs sprawled out while pregnant women were standing around and children were standing.   I was standing near a little child, this little boy was  so respectful and quiet. Have some decency and class to at least stand up when you see a kid standing! no morals these days! I was sick of it. The humidity,the long wait,standing there watching as people get seated when they came literally 10 minutes after me and waited 5 minutes when my friends and I waited 2 hours! AND THE BEEPER STILL DIDNT GO OFF! ridiculous! common courtesy,I hope the manager is reading this because this is not an upscale restaurant to be treating people like this.I have been to many upscale restaurants from NY to LA, and they treat their customers with respect.I am a very patient person and I dont mind waiting, the wait isnt what ticked me off.It is the total disregard! the hostesses were making full eye contact with people standing there! couldnt you notice people were standing there as long as your shift was? I am not going to be too hard on them because I have dined in this place and the food was amazing.Proportions were huge! waiters were very kind and helpful. I would recommend the Thai lettuce wraps as an appetizer. however, this place needs  a new system of seating people! because it is not right and not fair for people to be standing for 2 hours, while some people are seated in 3 minutes.  Because what is going to end up happening is these people are going to leave. Nobody is crazy enough to wait 2 or more hours. Without sitting! because apparently those seats are always taken by grown adult Lumber jack built men who cant stand with the rest of us women,children and pregnant people.  MANAGEMENT: if you are going to have people wait ridiculous amounts of time at least put more seating out! so I dont feel like Im playing musical chairs and I'm standing around with no seat. I literally had a throbbing migraine and a turning stomach from the smell of food,humidity,synthetic cheap $1 store body spray from SOME customers who passed by, or the smell of old dirty winter clothing from other customers. It was so packed that people were standing back o back like old school fire drills. So if anyone had bad smelling hair or bad Body odour,it was in full effect. You can not have people standing around. People are standing around in a crowded area while others are coming in, so I was constantly bumping into people by accident.

70,Staycia S.,"Queensbury, NY",20,3,,1.0,2017-05-17,"On May 3rd 2017 I went to the cheesecake factory in Albany NY. I was accompanied by my mother-in-law and my son. I notice that our silverware was just placed onto the table with no napkin or plate underneath them. So I gathered all the silverware an was going to ask for clean ones before we ate. (Im not a germaphobe but I've worked as housekeeping in a hospital an it opens your eyes to a whole new world of germs.) I look to the left and I noticed the busboy quickly cleaning the table not noticing how he ""cleaned"" the table at the time. As I sat there and talked to my very excited 5 year old about his pizza he so wanted badly...The bus boy came to the table to the right of us he quickly scoops the plates into his ""dirty plates bucket"" and resets the table not cleaning off the table with a rag (even though the rags aren't always that clean anyways still seems more sanitary then the person sitting there prior.) He then sets the new ""clean"" silverware on the dirty table. So I began to look at the silverware we had gathered into the middle of the table. Mind you we had not ordered anything prior to this. As normal there was dishwasher water spots on the knifes but what grossed me out the most was lettuce stuck on the fork I was going to use to eat my food. (It actually made me sick to my stomch) As I finally flag down our waitress here comes our food so I refuse the food. I told her nicely I'd pay for the drinks but not the food an we were leaving. She got the manager and told him what I had told her. He said drinks were on the house. Now mind you my five year old son was very anxious for that pizza that was about to be served to him. ( to the point of crying an my mother took him to the car so there wasn't a melt down.) I could not let him eat that seeing how they cleaned their customer side of the restaurant. How was the back of the restaurant cleaned? How was my food prepared? I could not see what happens behind closed doors but definitely saw what was in front of my face. I have never been to The Cheesecake Factory and I have heard so many good things about it. I will never return to this one!!!!

69,Jermaine L.,"New Windsor, NY",0,3,10.0,1.0,2017-05-21,"One of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had. Food was even worse. Had a 630pm appointment. Arrived at 545pm. Lines were moving and we checked in early. Everyone else was sat down before us. Larger and smaller parties so there was no excuses why we were over looked and not sat down until 7:04pm. Didn't see a waitress until over 10 minutes of seating. Came to the table and acted like any questions we had was a problem and that we interrupted her break. Facial expressions and body language was all off nevertheless ordered our food and after three trips to the table with the wrong orders finally got our order after an hour. You can tell they forgot the food under the lamps because my pasta was stuck to the plate and hard( which the waitress seen and agreed yet still delivered it to the table like I wasn't worthy of good service or food) Everyone at the table food was cold.  When we advised our waitress of the food she agreed yet still acted like it was a problem that we complained about our food. Took my plate back to the kitchen which took less than five minutes to bring back to the table only to find out it's the same pasta that left the table, they just put in and reheated it. Pasta was still hard on the bottom. When I advised the waitress just to give me the check and let me get out of here it still took over ten minutes to get the check which she over charged me then took another ten minutes to correct the problem with managements help. The manager came to the table and mind you I'm paying for three out of eleven people at the table and all of our dishes were messed up didn't even apologize. After paying over $85 for three nasty and disgusting dishes which all were taken out the restaurant and thrown away in their trash outside( mind you nothing was taken off the ticket knowing how bad the food and service was) I asked the manager for his card and started explaining what went wrong and he totally brushed me off and basically was told to go back to my table that they were working on it. Bad as it all was the manager didn't even know the waitresses name. She looked so offended when he got her name wrong. I wish I could say that this was the end of my horrible night which was suppose to be a glorious day because my sister graduated college after all the obstacles that she has gone through. As I started to drive home which is about two hours away, I had to make two stops on the side of the road due to me not being able to hold the food down. Threw up all over my dashboard and inside windshield was the first stop and next stop was to wipe down and clean my car out. Do you know how hard it is to clean throw up out car vents while trucks are passing you at 70mph? My two year old son just fell asleep after two diaper changes in two hours. I don't know how you guys stay open with horrible customer service and disgusting food. As I see the comments and reviews I get even more mad at myself for not reading all these before entering this establishment. The replies are so generic and could care less about your experience. So to Oliver Sanders the manager who gave me his card please continue to work on your training and how you talk to people. Take care of your customers, if it wasn't for us you wouldn't have a job. Just a little food for thought. Server 0689 Cierra L. You tried. The Georgia peach was on point from the bar. Everything from the kitchen was horrible. I even wrote that on the credit card receipt, not that anyone one in there cared.

My wife came with the intent of ordering Guacamole.  I was the first to find it on page five, I think.  It is billed as Guacamole Made-to-Order ($11.95) and our server asked us how spicy we would like it - mild, medium or spicy.  We requested ""spicy"" but we think they may have forgotten to put any jalapeños in it.  The salsa that was also served with the chips had more spice to it than the guacamole.  Other than the lack of jalapeño flavor it was OK.  At least it was freshly made. My wife also ordered the White Chicken Chili ($13.95), no I don't recall what page it was on, but I think it was listed on both the main menu and the Skinnylicious ® menu.  The pieces of chicken breast were mixed with white beans, roasted green chili peppers , onions, garlic, and cream, garnished with steamed rice and salsa.  It was a large portion so at least half of it came home, and it will probably taste even better after all the ingredients have a chance to meld. I zeroed in on the two-page Specials Menu and selected Pasta Napoletana ($13.95).  On top of parmesan cream pasta was Italian sausage, pepperoni, meatballs, mushrooms, pepper, bacon, onions, and garlic with a tomato sauce.  The best part was the sausage which had a good flavor and a little spice.  The thin pepperoni slices had a nice crispness, maybe from being sautéed.  Nothing special from the meatballs, but again half of this large portion came home and I'm looking forward to all the flavors blending together over time. Our server was friendly, attentive and conversational.  Maybe our next visit will be simply for some cheesecake to-go!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-albany,2.68,2.72,2.72,2.38,2.704
76,Sean M.,"Albany, NY",119,3,,2.0,2017-06-27,"I wish I could rate the food and the service apart from each other because the service aspect was extremely lacking on this visit.  Arrived on a Sunday afternoon around 2 clock and was able to be seated on the patio since the weather was so beautiful.  Was greeted by our server and ordered two waters, lemon , a coffee and a cocktail.  Half of the drink order was brought over to our table and needed to be requested again because it was clear that with no mention of the rest coming, that it was just overlooked.  Okay, so not a huge deal.  Ordered the lettuce wrap appetizer to share and two club sandwiches.  After 25 minutes of waiting for the appetizer I asked our server if it was coming out first as I did not want the food all at once.  The server said it would be coming out first but gave no mention or reasoning as to the long wait time.   Okay, still not the biggest deal until it finally arrived.  At 28 minutes, the appetizer came out but the server brought no sharing plates.  She recognized this on her own and asked if we would like plates.  We responded yes and ordered another cocktail.  Well five minutes went by and our appetizer was still just sitting there because she never came back with the plates.  Seeing that there was this huge server station on the patio, I stood up, walked over to it and got my own plates so we could enjoy our food.  Exactly why did she walk by this station to go back inside without grabbing plates is beyond me.  It would have taken her 30 seconds instead of letting us sit there with no plates to eat.  The kicker is that when she finally did come back with the drink order, she had no plates in hand  After the appetizer and a order of edamame that we ordered half way through our sandwiches came.  Food was great.  For some reason the fries on my sandwich were cold and my companions were hot.  Honestly, at this point, cold fries are hardly something I care about so I just let that go.  However once we finished our sandwiches our server disappeared...for over 20 minutes.  We sat there needing boxes and the check.  I once again after getting frustrated waiting again, stood up and was about to head to the server station when my lunch companion flagged over a busboy who was quick to get us what we needed.  We packaged up all our food and when the server noticed us doing this, came over promptly with the check and to get the payment.  Maybe she was finally catching on to the fact that we did half our service on our own.  Overall, all the food was great except for one order of cold fries on the sandwich plate.  The service however seriously lacked and is one of those experiences that when your left to wanting to go out to a restaurant for a relaxing experience will make you think twice before deciding to go again.  Perhaps the server had a lot of tables inside and was really busy, I'm not entirely sure, but again, she walked by a station where she could of gotten plates.  That is just plain unobservant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-albany?start=60,2.72,2.69,2.69,2.216,2.702

First off other locations have always taken reservations for larger parties, when I called to make one they said only after 9:30.....even though the web and yelp said they took them. When I mentioned that to the hostess and manager at the counter they disagreed with me in a disrespectful way. All I wanted was to bring it to their attention. We were told that the wait time was 30 minutes but after sitting there for 45 minutes we asked. The hostess said that they had paged us (which was always being held and never went off) then they said called our name, which must have been a whisper since again we never heard that and we were SITTING right there. Overall wait time was an hour. And after all that the meals were less then desirable.

35,Joseph K.,"Schenectady, NY",0,10,1.0,1.0,2017-07-14,"Tonight I called at 6:33 and spoke to Zackary. I told him I would like to place my name on the call ahead service for a party of three. Zackary told me they currently had a 30 minute wait and he said he would take my name and number and add us to the list. I thank him and told him he was great, his reply ""I try"". He said a Joseph we will have a table waiting for you in approximately 30 min. We will see you when you get here. I again thanked him and hung up the phone. When we got there the placed was packed elbow to elbow with people. When I checked into the podium, the young lady chuckles and said I'm sorry, it's a 45 minute wait and offered to give me an buzzer that would go off when our take is ready. I tried to explain that we had called and spoke to Zackary and he said it was about a 30 minute wait when I called and that he would have a table waiting for is when we arrived. A manager was standing within an ear shot of this conversation and walked over and told me I was wrong, that they don't take call ahead seating and that now I was at the restaurant, I would have to wait my full 45 minutes if I wanted a table. I noticed that there was a young man with dark hair and glasses standing behind him acting sheepishly, I looked at the name tag and the name on it was Zackary. When I asked to speak with him, his manager whispered something in his ear and he disappeared. Less than 20 seconds later another manager appears and chimes in said obviously you have never dined with us before and informs me that they don't take call ahead seating and if I still wanted a table I would have to wait the new quoted time of 45 minutes. At that time, I mentioned to him we live in Colonie and have been there several times in fact our friends and family had bought us gift certificates in the amount of $100.00, and we were there for dinner to redeem them before we lost them jokingly. At this point, the second manager to arrive takes it up a notch implying that I was hard of hearing and loudly states that the wait for a table was 45 minutes. He stood there with his arms folded in front front of himself glaring at me posturing as if I was crazy and dared me to say another thing. At that point I was discussed with the level of service and all I could do is reach into my pocket and hand him the gift cards and said we would never be back.  We went to Texas Roadhouse and waited less than 10 minutes and were seated.  So in summary if you want to be lied to over the phone, wait a ridiculous amount of time after you've already been quoted a 30 minute wait, and brow beat and shamed by both of the house managers go there. I hope you have better luck than we did.  One more thing, I also work in the service industry and manage 3 high end salons in the area don't think I won't use this as a perfect example of how not to treat our guests in the next training session.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-albany?start=20,2.48,2.64,2.64,2.212,2.576

38,Corazón V.,"Phoenix, AZ",12,2,,1.0,2017-08-26,"Terrible terrible service. Today we had a reservation at 12:30, sat down within 5 minutes, had Micheal C. as our server, gave our drink order and food order at the exact same time (there was 8 of us) drinks came out right away, bread took a little time maybe (5-10) server was nice but wasn't very involved with the table. One of the waters had a nice smear of butter on the out side from a finger from a waiter and something in the inside of the cup, so we pushed to the side/center of the table and was never addressed. Appetizers that 2 people ordered, which was 2 salads, and (1) taquitos plate with 4 small taquitos. That took maybe 15 minutes to come out. Then we didn't get out main dishes until about almost and hour after initially sitting down. While I understand courses are typically spaces out, even during the items shortly after they were deliver so that it arrived in an appropriate proportion to when the appetizers were done. So, after speaking to the server 3 different times it amazes me that he didn't notify the manager to touch our table to possibly resolve the issue. So finally, after talking to a one of the many managers I believe it was Johnathan, our food cane out quickly but only two dishes at first, maybe after a few minutes followed by alot of dishes and people helping to deliver the food, then to begin eating, both soups were lukewarm, my pasta had a top layer of dryness to it, the sandwich was extremely toasted, clear something's were sitting in a window, and at one point was told that the side to the burger was in its way and that they wanted to get the food out--fries never touched the table. Still, no manager stopped by, no asking if matters were resolved or what had happened. In the end I'm not quite sure what the issue is, I'm not sure if it stemmed from the lack of food runners or kitchen staff, or a terrible management system, but something wasn't right and it was very sad to see people have a bad experience and no one seems to want to recover the business.

Each cake was full with at least 4 slices ind the glass was clean and spot free of handprints.

The second cashier came up and was kind when I asked which cheesecake I should order because I've had them all at least a dozen times (probably more) and wanted to try one of the new ones.

2,Jessica G.,"Margate, FL",481,618,1408.0,3.0,2017-10-25,"This was the first time I have ever actually had a real meal at The Cheesecake Factory! I am no longer one of the few who has never been. We chose this location for a little family reunion of sorts...about ten people, a few kids, on a Tuesday evening. My aunt had called ahead to make sure they'd be able to accommodate our somewhat larger group and they were great about getting us all a table together in the bar area and making us happy...so thank you to the staff! My brother an I arrived a little early and decided to grab a drink at the bar and take advantage of happy hour pricing. Happy hour here only goes til 6pm (boo) but it includes well drinks, house wines and a few fancier cocktails for $6. Draft beers are priced a little lower. They also have quite a few happy hour bites available at a discounted price, but we didn't partake since we were waiting for dinner. Once the whole family arrived we were seated and began looking over the menu. It took us awhile to order because we were catching up with each other and having a great time, and the menu is HUGE. I know eating out is never really a healthy choice, but seeing the calorie counts on the menu were kind of terrifying. I automatically steered myself away from the pastas and the fried items because just seeing that calories was so scary. I ended up going for the vegan cobb salad and added shrimp...so not so vegan anymore. The food took quite awhile to come out, but we were happy because we were chatting. The salad was large, I took half home, and was a bed of romaine covered in avocado, asparagus, chickpeas, tomato, beets (red and golden), and of course my added shrimp. There were only four but they were a decent size and had a nice char to them. My cousin's salad was lacking avocado despite being listed as coming with it and the waiter was happy to bring her out a plate to correct the issue. Overall it was a good meal. It seems you can't leave the cheesecake factory without getting cheesecake so we ordered a few slices to share among the table. They're huge so unless that's all your eating I can't imagine finishing a whole slice. At the table we had cookies and cream cheesecake, and salted caramel cheesecake that I tried. Both super rich and sweet...I'm not too big on sweets but it is the Cheesecake Factory and they have it down. The salted caramel did a decent job of cutting the sweet so I could really enjoy it. Overall great place for upscale family dining, but all that considered it is a chain and they aren't doing anything too unique or amazing, so three stars it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-albany,2.52,2.71,2.71,,2.6340000000000003

66,Samantha H.,"Mechanicville, NY",30,5,,1.0,2017-11-09,"I was here a couple weeks ago with my family for my birthday with a party of 9. We were seated pretty quickly. It did take a while for us to order as the party members did get there at separate times, but as soon as everyone was there it took over 30 minutes for the wait staff to check in on us and check on drinks or ask if anyone wanted appetizers. So we place our orders and it takes over an hour for us to get our food, and meanwhile, no one checked in on drinks or to even let us know what the status of our order was. I had to ask after almost 90 minutes because no one was going to volunteer that information, clearly. So our food finally comes out, everyone's plate except my husbands. Again, there was no acknowledgement made in regards to this at all from any of the 4 food runners that came out to give us our food. So at this point I pretty angrily inquired about why my husband wasn't brought his dinner. Our waitress asked for our patience while she spoke with a manager to find out why his food wasn't ready. So 20 (!!!!!!!!!) minutes passes by with no response, so I had to track our waitress down to which she responds ""I forgot to ask!"" I'm sorry are you freaking kidding me?!?!?!?!?! So about 3 minutes later she comes to our table and says that the kitchen didn't make his food right the first time so they're just now working on his dinner, meanwhile everyone else has had theirs, but has refrained from tucking in so my husband isnt at the table watching everyone else eat. So his food finally comes out 10 minutes later so for a total calculation my husband has been waiting almost 2 hours for his food which is freaking obscene. The waitress was apologetic and offers a free piece of cheesecake but the slice can't exceed $6?!?! are you serious?!?! So I flipped, I won't lie. Not only does she have the audacity to act like its not her responsibility or her JOB for that matter, but to try to reimburse my husband for his 2 hours wait time for a simple freaking dinner and put a cap on how much she'll reimburse for 2 hours wasted....I could have MADE dinner for 9 people in 2 hours. I insisted she take his dinner off the bill and I shouldn't have had to. As someone that worked in customer service for 10 years, I would know, that this is not acceptable. I'll be honest the total bill was almost $300 and we left her a $50 tip, but she's lucky she got one at all. On a side note, turn the freaking lights on in the restaurant would ya?! there were people trying to read their menus with the flashlights from their phones!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-albany?start=60,2.64,2.68,2.68,,2.664

I do have to say the menu is incredible , perhaps a bit overwhelming with so many choices but I like  that the menu also offers  lesser calorie count items.  We had friendly attentive service and even though this was a busy Sunday we were seated within 5 minutes for a booth for 2 . Our waiter was very friendly and attentive and explained any questions we had about the menu . I opted for the soup of the day which was a chicken  artichoke shitake  mushroom soup . It was creamy and delicious. I also ordered the appetizer of a chicken butter lettuce wrap with side sauces and a side of sweet potato fries . My dining mate   ordered the Sheila's chicken salad which had  a citrusy peanut vinagrette . He said it was delicious and refreshing . Portion  sizes were plenty , food came out nicely plated and hot food came out hot . Menu a bit pricey in my opinion for some items . Our lunch for two, over $40. No Room for desserts but the cheese cakes and desserts in the glass cakes looked splendid It was a busy Sunday and it seemed every employee was doing their job to please the customers in every way . I would certainly come back again for a dinner meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-albany,2.76,2.69,2.69,,2.718
22,Abdullah Z.,"Pine Hills, Albany, NY",11,1,,1.0,2017-11-22,This restaurant is not at all worth the price point.  The cheesecake is overpriced. If you're thinking of getting a strawberry cheesecake DON'T. It's literally a tiny piece of cake with strawberry and whipped cream ON THE SIDE as Opposed to on top where it should. Save your money and go to the whole foods next door and get yourself some gluten free cheesecake.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-albany?start=20,2.76,2.66,2.66,,2.7

I enjoy the orange chicken and tasting different cheesecakes but the wait time and cost always deter us from going their more often. The quality of the food is not really worth the price.

Negatives:  Cutlery did not have a clean look, plate was dirty,  food order was not accurate,  drinks were not topped off. The staff were all very polite. We were seated quickly, the restaurant was clean. The steak was requested with no peppers but was brought out with peppers. after bringing that to their attention their remedy was to bring the stake back to the kitchen take the peppers off and give us the food back tasting like peppers.  The whole purpose was to avoid the taste of peppers, if I had an allergy, this could have been a major problem.  The cutlery did not look very clean  And the bread plate was dirty. It's possible that someone was spraying cleaner on a rag and a nearby stack of plates were sprayed with cleaner.  The drinks were not refreshed at all,  after one hour even if a cup is half full of soda it is water down at this point and should be replaced. The taste of the food was great.

20,Nicole M.,"East Brunswick, NJ",0,28,1.0,3.0,2017-12-29,"My fiancé and I visited for an early dinner while driving through Albany on the way to Vermont. Generally, we are Cheesecake Factory fans. The food and service are usually pretty consistent and there is something for everyone on their extensive menu. This visit was lacking in terms of service and general politeness. When we entered, there was a line for the hostess stand, which we know is typical for dinner time at any Cheesecake Factory. After a short wait, we made it to the front of the line and were about to walk up to the desk when two women walked up from the side and abruptly cut in front of us to put their name on the list! Yes, extremely rude, but we'll get over it. Finally get our name on the list and ten minutes later, my name is called. Before my fiancé and I can even walk back over to the host stand, another group walks up and the hostess seats them. Here I am thinking, ""Okay, I have a generic first name so she probably shares my name."" However, over the course of the next few minutes, our name is not called while groups who came in after us were. Went up to the hostess stand again and sure enough, the wrong group took our table. We were apologized to and assured that we would get the next table. However, more time passed and we were still not called. Went up once again and the woman I spoke to did not even remember talking to me, but finally brought us to a table. Not a great first impression. At the table, we were happy to be finally have the chance to relax and enjoy a nice meal. After looking over the menu for about ten minutes, we noticed that none of the servers had greeted us yet. We continued to wait, but sure enough, none of the servers in our section stopped to greet us or even bring over some waters. We were eventually able to politely flag over a server, and the rest of the meal was fine, but that was certainly strike three for our experience. Considering the fact that we began to question whether or not we were invisible to the surrounding guests and employees, we were not impressed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-albany?start=20,2.76,2.63,2.63,,2.6819999999999995

They said it was a fire hazard and that only if I had a car seat.  I understand that I can't park the stroller on the aisle but they didn't offer any other solution.  They could have asked me to wait so they can rearrange a table so that the stroller can fit.   This is at a mall location, how they could not accommodate a stroller is beyond me.

27,Kate B.,"Albany, NY",79,3,,3.0,2018-01-06,"Our server was great, he was efficient and timely, we never had empty drink glasses.  He was friendly and helpful when it came to accommodating our baby- I wish I could remember his name. The food was delicious. However, the hostess table seemed a bit disorganized and the hostesses and were not warm or friendly. My husband forgot to let the hostess table know we had a baby and so we had to wait much longer then expected in order to have a high chair.  When I inquired how much longer our wait was bc we couldn't stick around another 30 minutes with a hungry child and had already been waiting an additional 20 after being told 10-15 minutes, the hostess reminded me that we made the mistake and now we had to wait and refused to give me an estimated time- she could only tell me, ""when the next large table becomes available"". She was demeaning and very rude when I was simply inquiring as I have a hungry baby and needed to plan accordingly- and explained so.  They also need to be a little more discreet when sizing people up to see if they will fit in a booth.  The hostess staff are the first impression so it's important that they are trained to accommodate guests and show grace when mistakes are made rather than make us feel punished for a misunderstanding.  Your staff also need additional training in accommodating children as this was not our first negative experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-albany?start=20,2.64,2.63,2.63,,2.6340000000000003

Instead of a traditional cornmeal breading, they used a chicken batter. Also, they served the belly meat with the gray fat left on. Yuck. The fish did not have a good flavor at all. My husband ordered spicy cashew chicken. The chicken was tender, but the sauce was terrible. It tasted nothing like cashew chicken.
