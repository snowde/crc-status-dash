I ordered the ultimate margarita and I tasted more triple sec than actual tequila. Kind of disappointing seeing that I was in Denver the week prior and dined at a cheese cake factory there and they made a really good ultimate marguerite there. My main disappointment stems from that because I'm in New Mexico and should only expect any top notch margarita or one that has at least an inkling taste of tequila.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-albuquerque?start=160,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668

Since this is the first one in New Mexico and people complaining about it's a two hour wait. It's expected and they have employees from other states helping the Albuquerque employees get on their A-game. Give it a couple of months and surely every waiter/waitresses will know mecca of Cheesecake Factory by heart.

I wasn't that thrilled to go there in the first place having been in other states, but a large group of us wanted to try it out for someone's birthday so I obliged. Two of us arrived early to reserve a spot for 10 people, and we were told we needed a manager's approval for groups of that size, so I was pulled out of the line to wait. Meanwhile, they are accepting names for other parties pushing us further and further down the list. A manager eventually came up to us and told us it would be 2.5 to 3 hours for a group of 10. When we asked why they didn't accept reservations, the manager told us it was because guests waiting in line get mad when they see empty tables being reserved for other guests. Hmm, I wonder how other restaurants get away with it? Perhaps they don't have long lines of guests waiting and getting mad because they accept reservation for large parties to begin with.

The salads came out wrong and he apologized and he fixed the check. But when my wife's food got there and 45 more minutes went by before I had to make a scene to call attention that I had no food. It was crazy. Then the manager doesn't even give us the courtesy of coming by. Just has the bartender to ask if I even want it.  Yeah! Still haven't had dinner. I ate while drinking my wife's water cause not only no water refill but no offer for another beer. He honestly hurt himself. I was ready to spend around $120 on dinner. But oh well the bill was 39 and we still have him 10. Never even met a manager. Never was offered dessert. Even though we were looking around at the cheesecakes. Just over all not good. I hope it's growing pains but for me it will be another year before I even care to give them another shot. If at all. First time at any Cheesecake Factory. Don't know that I care to go back.

As is this new one in Albuquerque. We had waited long enough. I have been to  and people have waited long enough. I understand even though this is my country as much as anyone but I do expect suspicion when I step out of the house. May be I would be suspicious too if I belonged to a different denomination. The manager himself was asked to show us to our table. He literally ran away from us. We thought it was a new place and his hands were full. We were helped to our seats very politely telling us the manager had gone to find us a high chair. I am no longer sure if that's the truth. Our waitress kept asking for our order. She returned to our table three times under three minutes. We hurriedly ordered. The waitress served bread baskets all around but we were simply ignored. After an hour we were told she forgot to place our order. I demanded to speak to the manager. When I finally did get to talk to the manager he did not have much to say. When I told him this was the first time in five years I had felt like this in this city he told me he was sorry I felt that way.  I can live without going to the Cheesecake Factory. They do have a big menu. But the way I look at it its just a fancy Mcdonalds that serves expensive cake.The founding fathers had a vision for a new world. So left some provisions for the people of the future to work with. But in each time we find the worst in us have the better of us. Find new people to spit on from around us.

The waitress arrived next and presented the bill, Miso Salmon removed.  Since the bill arrived with the Miso Salmon removed as promised but without the Miso Salmon re-cooked, I figured the chef had screwed up a third time.  The manager showed up again, apologized, said there had been a misunderstanding of my instructions and the salmon would not be coming out.  I just wanted out of there at that point so I could go to the nearest Taco Bell, where they always present a perfect Taco Supreme.  This particular CCF needs to charge Taco Bell prices until they get their act together.  Additionally, given the myriad Yelp complaints about this CCF, their corporate management should terminate the manager/chef, bring in a new team overseen by someone from the Atlanta, GA or San Mateo, California CCF restaurants to oversee things until this locale lives up to the name.  At present, they are ruining the good will and solid reputation that other CCF's have built over the years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-albuquerque?start=180,2.56,2.56,2.56,2.372,2.56

I got a burger, my husband got chicken Parm sandwich, and my son got pizza. Burger was surprisingly good, and my husband and son both demolished their lunch as well. Soda refills were sporadic, and honestly it was a half-step above Chili's. Good but not worth the work of standing in line and shivering on the side patio.  The second time was much better, on a noon lunch. My friend had the club salad and I had the ahi tuna salad. Really tasty and fresh, and we had better seats by the bar. The cheesecake is FABULOUS (it was my friend's birthday so we had to indulge!) We got a variety with caramel on top and finished very last bite. Service was better, too.  So averaging a 3 star experience with a 4.5 gives Cheesecake Factory a rounded 4 stars. I highly recommend going on an off time. Just not worth it otherwise. I don't see this becoming a regular hangout, but I won't refuse an invite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-albuquerque?start=100,3.08,3.08,3.08,3.056,3.0800000000000005

I came back 30-45min to get seated at a table near the bar. The waitress waiting on my table was very attentive & got us our food in a reasonable amount of time. I got the mac & cheese burger & it was pretty filling. The amount of food you get for the price is pretty good. I also got the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake to go & that was a pretty good decision. The second time I came in was for a cheesecake run... at like 10pm on a weekday night. I was literally the only one in the cheesecake pick up line -- but had to wait like 5min before someone actually helped me.

51,Mike S.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,17,6.0,5.0,2016-07-09,"Very rarely do I give a restaurant a five star review.  Today I experienced 5 star service and 5 star food at Albuquerque's new Cheesecake Factory.   We arrived at opening time,  (11:00 a.m.  Saturday morning)...  Since opening a few months ago, the location  has been overwhelmed with business and it  has been almost impossible to secure a table. I was reluctant to patronize this location after having read several ""negative""  reviews here on Yelp.   But like anything else, food and service is very subjective.    My dining guest  and I decided to experience it firsthand and reach our own conclusion.  Given the fact they have only been open a couple of months, I expected there to be ""opening month""  blunders and lots of them.  That in fact did happen.   Now that Albuquerque's  Cheesecake Factory has had a few months to find their way,  they're ready for ""prime time"".  Bear in mind that I am one of the harshest restaurant critics on the planet earth... Having said that, I must share with you my dining  experience.   We were greeted by a pleasant young man ""DANNY"" , our server.  He was quite knowledgeable about the menu and was personable and friendly. We started with a couple of appetizers. ... Fried Zucchini and Guacamole and chips... They were delivered promptly.   What a pleasant surprise...  The Guacamole was made up of  giant chunks of fresh cut up avocados,  tomatoes and onions and a nice blend of spices,  unlike the usual mish mash you get at other restaurants .  Indeed, the best Guacamole I've ever had in Albuquerque.  My lunch guest ordered fish and chips... I ordered their pit beef sandwich which is a roast beef au jus sandwich which came with a cup of  natural beef dipping  juices  and horseradish on the side.  The fish and chips were  hot and crisp served with tartar sauce.  My hot roast beef sandwich was absolutely delicious...  The beef was  thinly sliced, very tender and  cooked perfectly to a medium and was served with a  slice of cheese and caramelized onions on a delicious seeded roll along with sweet potato fries.

Our server was really nice; she even got in a conversation with my brother. However, we couldn't get a hold of her often because of the crowd.

221,Roberto E.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,28,1.0,3.0,2016-07-16,"Nothing tops off an afternoon of shopping better than a great meal at an amazing place... or so we thought. When we first walked in we expected the crowd at the front so we were ready to wait until we were told we could sit in the bar area which we took full advantage of and thought to ourselves SCORE!... no wait. A couple of minutes later our waitress greeted us and took our drink order. Ten minutes later we got our drinks and placed our order right away so there wouldn't be too much of a delay since the place was getting busy. 35-40 minutes later we received our entrees, we could tell our waitress left them sitting for a while because the top was cold and it wasn't until we stirred them that they actually were warm enough to eat. During the 35 minutes that we waited we saw our waitress a couple of times and she kept telling us they were still working on our order then she disappeared for a while--the adjacent waitress could probably tell we were becoming aggravated and she came over to check on us and offered to refill our drinks which we were thankful for since our own waitress didn't do so. In fact, we waited so long, the tables that were seated after us received their food 10-15 minutes before we did. Our waitress never apologized for the wait nor did she offer anything else, she dropped off our food and disappeared again. Once we finished she promptly brought us our check, she wasted no time ringing us up--I wish she would have been that quick with our food. I have to give credit to this place for having an amazing atmosphere, the décor is beautiful and comfortable even though it was really busy during our visit. Also, once we received our food, the taste was great and the portion just right. I'm not sure what it's going to take to fix the service and attitude of the workers at this location, none (except for the adjacent waitress) seemed to care, even the on duty manager didn't seemed bothered by the mounting complaints as we saw him comping checks from other unhappy customers. I suppose we could have complained to him directly and maybe had our check comped as well but judging by his attitude and the way he disrespecfully rolled his eyes at the customers he comped, it would have been a waste and I would have had some choice words for him if he rolled his eyes at me as well so we instead called it a loss and left. This is by far the most mismanaged location I have ever been to-- there needs to be change from the top. Prior to posting this review I read previous reviews and more importantly the responses from the ""business manager"" to all the complaints posted on this forum which amounted to no more than a poor excuse for an apology to my fellow yelpers, I honestly expect the same lacking response to this posting. I challenge management to make a change, a lasting change that will save this location otherwise it is doomed to go the way of most big chain restaurants--mediocre and forgettable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-albuquerque?start=220,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.7640000000000002,3.0800000000000005

Our server was absolutely horrible. His lack of attention to our table was unfortunately painful. We had to waive our server down to let him know we wanted more iced tea and soda. He brought fresh luke warm tea without ice. Again we waived him down to advise that the tea wasn't ""iced tea"" as it was missing ice. We finished our meal and waited about 20 minutes before we, again, waived our server down to let him know we wanted our left overs placed in a to-go boxes. Keeping in mind that the restaurant was busy, our server walked passed our table six times prior to our getting his attention. We advised our server we wished to order a couple of slices of cheesecake, also to go. Another 15 minutes went by before we were served our desert on plates. We advised our server that it was supposed to be in to-go boxes.  Our server decided to throw a bit of attitude at us.  I took control of his attitude immediately and respectfully told him of our concerns regarding his serving skills.  Of course this just made him delay with providing our check.  I went to the bar and asked for the manager on duty.  After expressing my concerns to this gentleman, we received our check and were surprised that a discount for our inconvenience was not applied. The server was left with a $2.00 tip and a note suggesting he have a remedial course in proper serving procedures.

I've been wanting to try this for some time but just never have. while we were on vacation in NM my step-mother treated us to this restaurant. Although we had kinda a difficult time finding this location we eventually did, its in the back of the mall.  We went in a Thursday evening around 9pm and we still had a wait. One thing that is nice is if you are able to use a smartphone you can pull up their whole menu online so you already have an idea of what you want when you are seated. We were greeted in a timely manner which I always appreciate. the menu ranges from what I could tell is from $12-30, and there are plenty of apps to choose from.  They offer several entrée selections that include but not limited to pasta, steaks , seafood, and salads. I had a ribeye steak for dinner which honestly was cooked like I asked and had a great flavor.  My Father opted for the Hibachi steak which he also enjoyed and both our meals came with mashed potatoes and vegetables. My Wife and Stepmother both opted for pasta dishes which were served with fresh grated parmesan cheese, my Son the fried shrimp platter which he didn't choose to offer me a sample but informed me they were delicious, lol.  and they did look like a nice size of shrimp. All in all we all enjoyed our meals, the only thing we regret is we were all so tired from a day of shopping in Sante fe we didn't try the cheesecake or other desserts.

The falafel balls tasted microwaved and there was way too much kale in it. The dressing they used was good at least. The bang bang chicken and shrimp was mostly sauce and little bits of chicken and shrimp.

94,David M.,"Nashville, TN",2,1,,1.0,2016-09-26,"Let me preface this by saying I had worked for this organization for almost two years and took great pride in the food and customer service. I still work in the customer service industry in another capacity and understand that there are times when things are out of your control. And then there are other times when the experience is made poor because of a lazy or poor server. Unfortunately tonight a one star rating is being quite generous. We had a group of 13 guys out for dinner and drinks to celebrate a day off work. The service was poor at best, our server made no mention of any specials, prefaced by saying bread would take awhile to come out and assumed we all wanted water to drink when he first greeted the table. He simply could have asked our drink order and appetizer order and got the night started. Unprofessional table greet and start. Furthermore when we said we wanted to order some appetizers, he only took our liquor orders and then left. By the time he realized he hadn't taken the appetizer order (15min or so) we had decided to just place a food order. Instead of taking our food order when we said we weren't going to order our appetizers and just food, he walked away AGAIN to get our drinks instead of getting our food order. Furthermore upon delivering our drinks he made the comment to one of the guys ""that our drinks are strong so pace yourself, I don't want to have to cut you off""....not sure the reason for this unprofessional comment. After receiving our drinks we assumed the bread that was ""still cooking in the oven"" (as told to us by our server) would be coming shortly. Another 10 minutes passed. When the bread arrived it wasn't even hot. So either he was lying to us about the bread cooking or he was lazy. Furthermore he brought us enough bread for a group of 6 people...maybe. He asked for more bread and he only brought it to one end of the table.  With our food order in, we decided to have another round of drinks. Our server at this point made the comment that he couldn't allow us more than one drink per hour because he wouldn't want to cut us off. We had been here at the restaurant for over an hour and was on our 2nd round. Quite unprofessional and honestly uncalled for. We weren't even close to intoxicated and if anything super frustrated at the poor service we were receiving and yet STILL ordering $10-14 cocktails for our group. Finally after being told on 2 different occasions that our food would be right out, it arrived about 40min after our order. I can understood a groups long ticket time but instead of an apology for the wait or anything...maybe even a manager stopping by...we got nothing. On top of all of that, the guy who was paying for the entire meal did not get his food until everyone was FINISHED eating their meal. He ordered a burger :/ seriously  Our server said he'd try to make it up to us with a slice of cheesecake or something. And yet he didn't have a manager stop by to say sorry or do anything to make up for it. We had 13 people order dinner and 3 rounds of drinks. You do the math on the tab. Furthermore he didn't even do a dessert presentation or insist on the cheesecake slice because of his blunder with the burger. Finally after getting the check and getting ready to leave, the gentleman who was paying the tab for our company outing spoke to the manager on our way out the door. Her only response was ""I'm sorry.""  She offered to do NOTHING to accommodate the poor service and lackluster experience on a MONDAY night.  To say the ball was dropped on this experience would be a generously kind way of venting frustration. After having worked for the company in one of the top performing locations in the country for almost two years, I'm somewhat disgusted by the lack of care for the patrons and guest experience. Obviously ""ultimate guest satisfaction"" was not a core value of the management or staff we encountered.  It's unfortunate from a personal level because of how much time and energy I had given to this organization and yet to have my fellow co workers have this experience. Management please fix this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-albuquerque?start=80,2.72,3.02,3.02,3.14,2.9000000000000004

The waitress said well I think there is still meat in it at which point we both stared at her like excuse me?! We both told her its a veggie burger there shouldn't be any meat in it at all.  Our waitress then picked up the menu just to make sure.  She said og your right, I'll put your order in and have your food out.  After she left we had to sit and think about what she just said.  I'm just saying its a veggie burger not a veggie and meat burger.  She was a nice girl bit the fact that you don't know that simple is kind of a let down.  Although she was very attentive to us that was her only flaw.  We both and cheesecake and I also had a hot chocolate.  As always the cheesecake was amazing, I had the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake which was amazing!!!

The service was not great! Worthy of a $1 tip kind of horrible. My friend and I went recently and we were seated just fine. However, when drink orders came around the server forgot her drink. Not a huge deal, but his service just got worse. He hardly checked on us. At one point I had to ask a bus boy for the side of honey mustard I had asked for that he had forgotten. We had to wave down other waiters for our check and refills. He was just neglectful. To top it off, my friend noticed him counting his tips while we waited for refills and her salad and my side. It's one thing to be slammed, it's another to just be a bad server. And I can speak from experience, as I have been a server. I really only give such abysmal reviews if the service is bad!

I have been to this location twice and they gave both been positive.  My latest visit our server was Joe G. We were seated at our table with no service for 3-5 minutes initially but I'm ok with that. I like to be able to look at the drink menu before being pounced on. He arrived at our table with a smile and quickly took our drink orders. Mai-Tai for a friend. Classic Mojito for me. Water with lemon all around. My Mojito was on point. Delish. My friend said he wished his Mai-Tai was more fruity than he was given but I didn't taste it so I can't judge on that.  Joe brought our basket of assorted breads and we placed our orders. One Jambalaya, one chicken and biscuits, one veggie burger and i had the Asian chicken lettuce wraps. I did not taste off of anyone's plate but my own but I will say that my lettuce wraps were crisp and fresh and yummy. I had the veggie burger in my previous visit and it was very flavorful. Same reviews were given by my friend on this visit with her veggie burger. My husband loved his chicken and biscuits. Just his kind of meal. Hearty and hot. Now my friend that ordered the jambalaya orders this same dish every time he comes to Cheesecake Factory. I think he dreams about it at night. It is by far his absolute favorite. I don't know why he even looks at the menu.  Of course we rounded out the meal with cheesecake. Always fantastic but then again they are the Cheesecake Factory! Joe G did an awesome job with serving us.  Our water glasses never ran low and we felt very well taken care of.

In truth, I was planning on eating here and feeling dirty after, like I was having a secret best friendship with my best friend's cousin but she could never find out cause she'd be heartbroken. I was pleasantly surprised with the level of service I received a few Saturday evenings ago right around 5. We had a baby and a toddler with us so we were primed to pick apart anything we deemed unworthy of a yelp 'whoohoo' review star. The menu itself is about 20 pages long so please bring your glasses if you need them and some patience;. If you're not great at making up your mind even when looking at smaller menus, this may not be the place for you. My issue with expansive menus is that I can't determine what it is they're good at cooking if they make everything. In order for a place with a 20 page menu to succeed, all of the menu items have to be at least a little better than average.Their cheesecake meets my guidelines. The appetizer was an array of fried avocado and zucchini which I really enjoyed. For dinner, I had pasta dish made with garlic sauce and tossed with veggies--it made me happy. I have to say that the service towards the end was a bit spotty because the servers were in the midst of shift change so if I had feedback to offer it would be to wait until your last table is served to tag team in your partner. Other than that, I'd go back for the cheesecake alone.

First, they say they're open late but what they really mean is that if you come in after 8p maybe you can sit at the bar and maybe someone will be willing to at least take your order at some point but don't expect drinks or bread or any of the other things you'll get in the regular dining areas. So, we came in after 8p, 6 of us. The second we walked in the hostess was less than thrilled to see us and everything went downhill from there. We saw at least 4 waiters/waitresses in the area, none of which could be bothered to help the one server that was taking care of all the tables seated in the bar. Needless to say we got no refills, we had to ask for bread a couple times before we actually got some and the food was not only barely warm and tasted ""meh"", it wasn't even correct!

The wait wasn't too bad, but for it being early afternoon (2:15) it was already starting to get packed. Parking isn't too bad as you can always park further out or walk through the mall to get there as well. Our waitress, Melissa, was excellent. She was able to suggest different drinks and food options to us. Food portions are huge even if you order off the lunch specials. If you palm on coming make sure you have an appetite or you'll be taking some home. We had two small snacks, the fried zucchini and cubano rolls. Both excellent options. For our meals we had the lunch meatloaf, the pasta carbonara with chicken and the bacon bacon cheeseburger. You will not be disappointed with any of them. And for the meatloaf and pasta being the smaller portions we were still taking half of it home with us. And don't even get started on the cheesecake options. Too many to choose from that you will be tempted to take some to go to try later. Overall it was and excellent place to get food and drinks. Only drawback is the price for cocktails drinks.

After being sat we waited 15 more minutes for our server Brian to get our drinks etc.  And 45 minutes for our food.  3. Food was horrible, and tasted like it had been reheated in a microwave.  Server messed up order 2x.  4. They were Out of wife's favorite dessert. (isn't this the ""cheesecake factory?"").

36,Jennifer M.,"Albuquerque, NM",4,65,73.0,1.0,2017-03-07,"Been here a few times and have yet to figure out why everyone says this is such a good restaurant.  Our last trip there seals the deal for why we won't be back again. Friday night, after waiting for a table we finally sit down. First, they're ""out of beer""--something about being out of CO2.. they're also out of the artichoke appetizer. The server said it's because they got a bad shipment last month and they haven't had them since, which I then posit the question ""you only order fresh produce once a month?!""  Ordered the crab dip appetizer and waited to order entrees. We specifically told the server we wanted to enjoy our appetizer before the entrees. Even after waiting to order entrees, our appetizer was out only 2 minutes before they flung entrees onto our table as well. I suppose that was a good thing because we had no appetizer plates and had been eating the bread using our menus as plates beforehand. Asked for another bread basket from the food runner that never arrived. Asked for more toast for the crab dip appetizer that took another 15 minutes so the dip was cold by the time that came out.  Now on to the entrees-- chicken pasta my friend ordered tasted as if they spilled a cup of sugar on top. The salad, which I had added chicken to came out with a cold leftover-looking piece of dried up chicken. So we don't cook the chicken fresh to order. Oh but they were able to microwave it up for me to dry it out even more than it already was--how swell.  At the end of our meal we asked about desserts but made sure to ask what they were out of first; which I believe it was 3 cheesecake flavors. Mentioned again how crazy it was they didn't have beer on a Friday night to our server who then said ""oh yeah they fixed it"" --Awesome, would've been great to know that so we could've ordered one.  The food quality is low, the servers aren't trained properly, and there's little reason to come back when with all the mishaps not one manager seemed to be on the floor putting out the fires.

The hollandaise sauce was putrid and inedible. Pancakes are served with their ""own syrup"" which is basically melted butter with a splash of maple flavoring- gross! So they gave us some cheap Smuckers Lite Syrup packets, like in an IHOP. Pathetic. Their service is like their food, inconsistent and sloppy.

The problem was I wasn't Yelping back when I lived in Oklahoma and would frequent this place constantly every other weekend when I would drive up to the capitol. If I were, I would tell you guys that they are just as amazing as ever, regardless of which one you go to. But the experience varies based on service. The food is almost always good. Usually. Let's talk about the first night I went to the Cheesecake Factory here in the land of enchantment. I ordered the shrimp scampi, which is a bistro take on the traditional dish. Basically, it's deep fried shrimp in a scampi sauce. In this iteration, everything as far as the sauce was spot on. Unfortunately, they took the misstep of burning some of the shrimp. So I thought to myself, ""okay...everyone has a bad night. no biggie. I'll let it pass."" I mean, we were already planning on returning here our last night in Albuquerque, we love the place that much. This second visit, I was determined to try the steak diane. But I didn't want that to be the only protein I had, just in case I didn't like it for whatever reason. So I got the factory combo of shrimp scampi (almost everyone deserves a second chance, after all) and the steak diane. Firstly, I am happy to report that the scampi was MUCH better this time around. All the shrimp were cooked perfectly with nothing singed or burnt. The sauce was just like I remember it. Plus it all blended beautifully with the mashed potatoes. Yeah...the combos come with mashed and Cheesecake Factory actually makes a damn good mashed. That said, we can discuss the steak diane. It was....different for me. Took some getting used to because honestly, I have nothing else to compare it to. I've never really had a steak diane before, much less know much about it. I know that it's a recipe generally consisting of a pan seared steak of sorts, tossed in a mushroom-ish sauce with black peppercorn and onions. Only the sauce Cheesecake Factory uses is slightly sweet. Again, not quite what I was expecting. But overall, it wasn't bad. At least I had the benefit of the mashed potatoes to counterbalance the mild sweetness brought on by the sauce. The steak itself was cooked a perfect medium as requested. But you'll notice from the pic I took that they serve this steak *almost* hibachi style. That's what it reminded me of really. Most places just leave the whole piece of steak uncut. This one came in pieces. Not really a deal breaker for me; just....different. I know that some of you will probably scream bloody murder when I confess this. But no...I did not order any cheesecake either visit. The main reason being is I'm not much of a dessert guy. And even when I am, it's WAY after the fact. The thing is I just genuinely get way too full to consider dessert immediately after dinner. I mean...who, over the age of 12 that isn't female, eats dessert *immediately* after dinner? Really. Guys...my metabolism isn't what it used to be. The ultimate takeaway from all this is simple: if you happen to be in a town or near a town that has a Cheesecake Factory in it, you are absolutely CRAZY not to go! They pretty much never miss the mark when it comes to the actual recipes. The only thing that could ruin your experience would be if you got subpar service. So stop on by! It will change your life. I'm giving The Cheesecake Factory in the land of enchantment 4 big juicy scampi shrimp with no burnt pieces out of 5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-albuquerque,2.8,3.2,3.2,2.8000000000000003,3.0400000000000005

At a whopping 1,000+ calories, this small bites plate (about the size of two handfuls) might kill your diet, but not your happiness! Crispy, savory, and flavorful all-in-all. It even won the heart of my sister, who despises cauliflower. Most of the entrée plates here are on the pricier side, but worth the portion, IMO. However, on my most recent visits, I've been sticking to the appetizers and shareable plates, as the complimentary bread/butter is rather filling. The service here is either decent or iffy, depending on the day of week and time of day you're dining I guess. I came here with my family (party of 4) a while ago on Sunday night, and we had to wait so long for our entrees that we needed to flag down our waitress, who said the food was apparently sent to the wrong table. Returned with a friend a couple months later during a weekday afternoon, and we were in and out within an hour.  I'm certainly not one who would spend around $7 on a single slice of Cheesecake, but my boyfriend has unashamedly done so many times here. As their signature (hence the chain's name), they were admittedly quite tasty. I did enjoy the tiramisu cheesecake, but it didn't blow my mind, to be worth that price tag, and for such a small slice.

The Caramel Cheesecake on the other hand was off-the-hook, lots of layers of flavor and wonderful texture. It is an art form.

We saw about 3 different couples who came in after us get seated before us. And a family of 4 who came in and within 5 minutes of waiting they were sat as well. We ended up waiting 35-45 minutes until we got seated. So that put a damper on the night so far.  Server: Once we were seated our server greeted us quickly got our drink orders, and put in our child's food. When we came back around the second time we asked him about the Crab and spinach dip he said it was amazing its not the fake crab/imitation so we said we would like to try that we also put in our main course during this time. We hadn't seen our server since we ordered our food but child's food came shortly after which was brought out by another server.Maybe after 20 minutes or so still no server our main course came out, we didn't get our appetizer and my sides were wrong on my plate. Finally our server came to check on us to make sure everything was alright I let him know about the app and the sides. I'm assuming he never put in the app because when we asked him about it he tried to play if off like ""oh well let me look into that for you."" We told him we didn't want it now but it think if we were paid attention to more this obviously wouldn't have happened. After this it seems like he was rushing us to get us out of there.  Food: Fish & Chips: More batter than fish, was okay nothing special wont be ordering again.  Fettuccine Alfredo w/chicken: Good full of flavor Kids Mac and Cheese: Very cheesy in flavor but good size portion. Overall: We will probably be back again but on a slower day than the weekends. I don't see why people like this place so much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-albuquerque,3.4,3.13,3.13,,3.238
