186,Liz T.,"Atlanta, GA",1,156,83.0,4.0,2012-03-16,"Haven't been back to a Cheesecake Factory in a while, but the Birthday Girl in our group decided that's where she wanted to go.  They didn't take reservations for less than 7 people, so we went right before the peak lunch hour and were seated right away in a great sunny spot.  Our friendly waiter told us that they had just switched out a dozen or so items on the menu ... since it was such an extensive menu, I'm not sure it mattered to us.   Our vegetarian friend was on a fried avocado streak after tasting some at On The Border, so we ordered their avocado spring roll to appease him and our hungry tummies while perusing the menu.  I've never had fried avocado and will have to admit that it was really, really good here especially with a drizzle of the tamarind sauce; but terribly fat too right? I had the kale salad (one of their smaller portions which turned out to be perfect size!) with their special of the day wild mushroom soup (delicious!!) - i'm now determined to make a kale salad on my own!  The birthday girl ordered a flatbread and when she wondered out loud why they didn't have a chicken option, the waiter offered to customize it for her - great service! .. turned out to be really great too.  One of the guys ordered their mexican or southwest chicken salad; it was the Cheesecake Factory supersized portion but sadly, the chicken compared to the mounds of lettuce was quite miserly.  In fact, when it first arrived, I had to help dig for the meat.  Birthday girl said she remembered the same experience on her last visit.  There were enough real vegetarian choices, i.e. not just rabbit salad food to satisfy our friend and he had a veggie burger which seemed awfully large and came with a good serving of fries.  He said it was good. We ordered two kinds of cheesecake for dessert to share - the Tuxedo and the Banana Cream.  Both were very good and the waiter was spot on with recommendation of the Tuxedo - it was his favorite, and I might be a convert now after tasting it! It was a great re-acquaintance with the Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-alpharetta?start=220,3.72,3.72,3.72,3.088,3.7200000000000006

We came around 6:30 Monday evening, and the place was at about 50% capacity (which was nice, but not too hectic= better service).  It was my mom, both my sisters, my nephews (3), and myself.  We got one of those long booths- seemed to fit alright (with the 2 y/o at the head of the table, ha).   The menu had changed a little, but still overwhelming.  You could literally eat here for a month 3 times a day and order something different every meal- it is one of those kind of menus! My family kept trying to enable my alcoholism so I started off with a Long Island.  I haven't had one of those since I was like 19 (ok, I am kidding, but it has been a while!), and damn it had a bite!  I downed it and stuck to Stella (on tap!) for the remainder of the night. Our server was Yolanda (I hope that is spelled correctly, if not, my apologies!), and she was good looking, and took care of us in every manner- near flawless service for 3 kids and 4 adults. My dumb ass ate a huge meal not too long before, so I stuck with a Santa Fe Salad, and let me tell you, that was one of the bigger salads I have had in my life (compares to a Buca Di Bepo family salad!)- and damn was it good!  The flavors came together well, something I will admit- I didn't expect that!  It left me full, and I could not eat the last few bites... The dessert menu here is top notch- but I was so full, we all ended up declining- probably one of the bigger mistakes in my life- as dessert here is an experience in its own. This place is great since it does have the options; anyone who cannot find something to eat here should be jailed.  I highly suggest coming here after a nice meal if you want a knockout dessert- I mean this place competes with places like Cafe Intermezzo and Alon's- a bold statement, but I would like to stick with it.  Don't forget they handle parties well here too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-alpharetta?start=80,3.72,3.72,3.72,3.152,3.7200000000000006
157,Laura M.,"Alpharetta, GA",34,55,,3.0,2012-06-05,"I know a lot of people scoff when you say that The Cheesecake Factory has good food but I just let them laugh. This is actually our go-to place for my husband's birthday because he loves their cheesecake so darn much. The food is actually quite good and if you can't find something to eat with their gigantic menu, well, there is no pleasing you. I love how you can have a healthy meal with their Skinnylicious (stupid name but good eats), small plates and salads or you can just strap on the food tray with their heavier meals. My favorite dishes are the Summer spring rolls (fresh, crisp and filling), mushroom lettuce wraps (hearty if a bit salty), and the Fresh Vegetable Salad. The kids meals come with fruit and there are plenty of healthy options which is a nice change from the usual kids menu. The portion sizes are gigantic so if you care for your health at all, ask for a doggie bag as soon as you get your food because you just can't finish it all.  Ok, I know you are saying ""But, this is the Cheesecake Factory, talk about the cheesecake!"" Well, I am one of the few people in America who cannot stand cheesecake so I'll give you my husband's take: ""It is eye-rolling good."" The man loves his dessert and the Vanilla Bean cheesecake is the stuff of his dreams. He branched out this year with the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream and enjoyed it but I think Vanilla Bean wins out. For people like me who gag at the thought of cheesecake, there are plenty of other great dessert options- bowl of fruit, ice cream and my favorite: Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake. Their desserts are giant so you'll be able to share with 7 or 8 of your closest friends.

Heard the wait staff sing happy birthday at four other tables before they did it at ours - for our youngest niece.  What a menu!  Changed my mind several times waiting to place the order.  Great cocktails and appetizers, too.  Try the deep fried macaroni - delightfully different but with good old Mac and cheese flavor. Want your food customized - just ask.  I ordered a pasta dish with extra garlic and red chili flakes - no problem.  Wait staff is courteous, funny and professional, something lots of other restaurants are short on.

150,Amy G.,"Atlanta, GA",48,159,7.0,1.0,2012-08-14,"Let me just preface this odyssey by saying that I've been eating at this Cheesecake Factory since it opened in 2004. My family has been a long-standing fan of Cheesecake Factory and will continue to eat at them. Just not this location. Last Friday, I met my family here for a rather routine end-of-week dinner. The restaurant was very busy. We waited and were seated within about 30 minutes. Our waiter was quick to greet us, but seemed distracted by the large birthday party in the middle of the room from the start. Ok. Fine. Par for the course. We ordered wines and waters. He brought the wines, then the bread. No waters. We had to ask twice more before we got them.  While we were waiting for our waters, we carried on with some conversation when all of the sudden BAM! and SPLAT! A nearby food runner dropped a small saucer full of mustard. It must have hit the floor at just the right angle and at just the right distance from our booth to splatter our table and surroundings perfectly. My jeans. My shirt. My purse. Mustard was everywhere. In my wine, on the flatware, on my face, on the wall of our booth. I didn't see exactly what happened, but it made a gigantic mess. Ok so back up to the scene where the guy drops the mustard. (We'll cover the mess later.) I understand that accidents happen. I've worked in the food service industry. But when you do something like that, you STOP what you're doing, locate materials to help clean up, and contact a manager -- or at the very least, the server. This young man did the opposite. He merely picked up the saucer, wiped up the mess that he saw in his tunnel vision, and started to walk away. Mortified by the mustard I was covered in, I sprang out of the booth and rushed to the bathroom to attempt to remove it from my clothing. When I got back, my mother said that she attempted to stop the young man to get his help cleaning up the mess, but he simply handed her napkins and walked away. Wow. Eventually, I got up and walked over to a manager to explain the situation and make SOMEBODY aware. By the time I got back, another manager was over out table apologizing and helping clean up. He got me another wine and offered to pay for dry cleaning to get the mustard out of my clothes. (ha!) But all good and great. Once he was aware, he was on top of it. Though, aside from apologizing the only other thing they ""took care of"" was the wine that had mustard spilled in it. That didn't exactly give us the feeling of being taken care of. Nor did it make a very good impression on us. The issue at heart is not that it happened. It's the way it was handled. This young man did not receive proper training. His on-boarding did not show him how to handle a mess nor how to manage a crisis. He didn't have the native know-how to stop and say ""hey - other people must have been affected by this."" So to know that you're dining in a restaurant with $20-45 plates where the staff hasn't been properly trained/just has poor hiring standards is a bit disconcerting.  I do plan on getting my clothing dry cleaned. And if the mustard doesn't come out, I do plan on being compensated for the value of those clothes. I also plan on not returning to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-alpharetta?start=180,3.56,3.56,3.56,2.9800000000000004,3.5600000000000005

For lunch my mom and I split the Asian Lettuce wraps, which were good, but nothing amazing. And these salmon rolls, which were incredible. We had Key Lime Cheesecake which was amazing! And their coffee is delicious. I love the glasses the coffee comes in.  I really wanted to write this review for the service, however. I'm big on service. The two hostesses were friendly, more so the guy than the girl. Now our server was great. Very friendly. I wasn't expecting much, but was taken by surprise with him! Wonderful server. Made a couple of subtle recommendations without being annoying about it. Attentive without being intrusive.  There was another waitress who commented on how cute my 7 mo. old was and noticed he was teething. She offered to bring over a banana and some bread for him to chew on. I couldn't believe it when she brought over a small plate of already cut pieces of banana and thinly sliced bread. That was SO incredibly sweet of her! I like when servers think of these extra things that I don't even think of. My son was so content eating his banana pieces and eating his little puff snacks in his high chair. She kept checking back to make sure he was all right and continued to compliment him and inquired about this and that. We appreciated the extra attention :) And she wasn't even our server!  My mom and don't like to be rushed and we just wanted to sip our coffee and talk and take our time. I think our waiter caught on to that and just let us be.

89,Jana S.,"Smyrna, GA",170,243,7.0,3.0,2013-07-29,"I have been to this specific restaurant on numerous occasions.  People from my office tend to come here for people's birthdays or other special occasions. I've had mixed results with their ability of handling larger parties.  Let's just say that if you come here with a large party, insist on more than one server. Every time we've only had one server, there have been excessively long wait times and confusions. Cheesecake Factory's menu is a novel.  I really really dislike the size of their menu.  Why on earth would you ever want to have the option of 250 different meals?!?  If you ever research the calorie count on some of their menu items, it'll make your stomach turn.  Even items that seem to be ""healthy.""  1000 calories for their lettuce wraps...??? And that's an appetizer!! I'm very glad that they have started the Skinnylicious menu (all meals less than 590 calories) and due to its more manageable size, I've started ordering only from there. My favorites from the Skinnylicious menu: the soft tacos, chicken salad sandwich, salmon, and my newest favorite: the Tuscan chicken!! Cheesecake Factory holds true to their name... it is a factory! But their food is decent and service is always excellent.  Just beware of what you eat... your waistline will thank you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-alpharetta?start=140,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.9560000000000004,3.4000000000000004

He won't ever say a Mai Tai is a girly drink now. :)  My friends and I shared the avocado egg rolls as an appetizer. It was good but nothing too special. There were only 6 pieces, and it cost $11. Yup. Yup. I ordered the pretzel-ed chicken skewers (unsure of exact name) on the appetizer/small dish menu, and it was pretty tasty. A unique texture to say the least. We ended up splitting a chocolate tuxedo cheesecake (perhaps my friend made the name up). It was chocolaty and delicious.  The waiter at our table was attentive and very friendly. I wouldn't say he was the most knowledgeable when it came to the drinks or some of the food recommendations, but a good enough waiter.

I've had that in the past, one time, but this was bad. The lady didn't seem like she knew how to talk to people at all. She was very awkward and never said Thank you or asked if we needed anything. Very strange. I ordered an alcoholic drink to start off my meal...that had NO alcohol whatsoever in it. I only drink about once a month, so one drink will give me a good buzz. This drink had ZERO alcohol. I was disappointed, but excited to get my main dish, one I ALWAYS order, the Luau salad. I always ordered it because the portion is so huge I eat some, and save it for another meal and for $14, it's well worth getting two meals out of it. The plate arrived at the table and it was ridiculous. The big won-ton squares filled up the entire plate. There was barely any salad. It was less than half what I used to receive in previous visits, ordering the same exact plate. My child got a $9 grilled cheese with fruit on the side. About 4 pieces of cut up fruit. THAT'S IT! Ridiculous!!! I ate the entire salad and wasn't even full. Then I get my bill and see I was charged $10 for a drink that was missing alcohol! My salad was the same $14 price. I was and still am extremely disappointed that I spent my money there. I wish I would've never gone and saved the money for Christmas gifts.

I say ""started"" because it took them a half hour to serve everyone.  They initally brought 12 meals.  Ten minutes later two more people got theirs.  The last one to get her food was the youngest member of our party.  Three years old and all she wanted was her chicken strips.  How hard is it to prepare three chicken strips and fries?  Totally unacceptable.   My wife and I had the club sandwichs.  I think they got the bread from the day old store.  Her fries were too hot to eat and mine were ice cold.  Several others had quality issues with their meals.  The manager was completely uninterested.  I am going to do my best to not let this color my views of all Cheesecake factories.  Since there isn't a CCF in Huntsville we probably won't be visiting one again soon.     I've read the other reviews and see that this a recurring problem with this specific restaurant and it seems to be one of consistency.   Some people get great service.  A lot don't.  They should  be delivering the same, great service and food to each and every customer every single day.  I had to give it at least one star because Linda's fudge cake was so good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-alpharetta?start=180,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.404,3.3200000000000003
128,Michael R.,"Atlanta, GA",28,19,,4.0,2014-06-20,"I have been to Cheesecake Factory in Beverly Hills, San Francisco, and Las Vegas and I have always liked it. They have a great variety menu (the menu is big so it can take a while to go thru the entire menu so I recommend ordering an app so you can have something to snack on while you read over the menu) and great fresh food. My girlfriend had been to the one on OKC and did not like it but since I've always liked Cheesecake Factory I thought it would be good for her to to try a different one and see if I could change her mind. We went in at 5:15pm so it was not busy overall except for the bar area. There were people in there having a going away party. I went to the host stand and told them I needed a table for 2 people. After only 2 mins we were being taken to our table the problem was they took us to a table in the bar area. Since I was not there for drinks or to watch a game I really did not want to sit in the bar plus it was loud in this area so it makes it tough to have a conversation. I was taken back that the host did not ask if I would mind being seated in the bar like is done in most restaurants. I can understand if the dining room is packed but considering how empty the dining room was I really could not find a valid reason for me to be seated in the bar area or at the very least asked if I would mind being seated in the bar. Not a good way to start trying to change someone's opinion.  I was about to ask to be seated at a table not in the bar but as I was getting up our server came to the table so I decided to just go with it. As my normal I placed an order for edamame while we took our time to look over the menu. I love how they serve fresh hot edamame. I quickly saw the Mac and Cheese burger and decided I had to try it. My girlfriend order the skinny tacos. She looked at me like I was crazy to order a burger at the Cheesecake Factory and I asked her if she ever tried them and she said no and I told her to just wait and she will see why I ordered it. We placed our order and our very friendly server came back with bread. I love their fresh wheat bread and butter they give you. The only downside is if you go crazy on it you will get full and leave no room for dinner or desert but I feel that's why you get food boxed and take it home. Our food was served in about 20mins. My burger came out hot and the skinny tacos came out cold as they should. If you have never had the skinny tacos they are chicken and veggies wrapped in lettuce with 2 sauces severed on the side so you can put on as much as you want. Overall they were good but to me it was like eating a salad but since you eat it with your hands it is a little messy but it was a nice twist to a normal salad. My burger was awesome. I gave my girlfriend 1/4 of my burger and she was shocked how good it was. She quickly wanted more. This is the only downside of giving someone a bite...they will always want more so be careful..lol The same thing will also happen to your fries as well so don't be prepared. We enjoyed our dinner and then ordered a slice of Keylime Cheesecake. I selected this one since I did not want something overly sweet and a nice closer to our meal and I was not disappointed. It is a huge slice and big enough for 2-3 people to share and loved the fresh whipped cream. We both loved it. Overall it was a great experience. It was a 100% change from her last experience in OKC and she agreed she was now a fan of Cheesecake Factory. Our server was excellent and very attentive.

Yes, one slice of the cake was about $8.00 and some may find that to be expensive, maybe it is but when I begin to eat it money is always the last thing on my mind. Ok, so I wanted some more dessert before I left town and so a friend and I ordered the Lemoncello Cream Torte to share. This too was VERY GOOD.

I ordered GF pasta which is only the spiral noodle. My dish had wheat noodles mixed in! That is BAD! I was so scared I would get miserably sick the next day.  I talked to a manager about the process in which the noodles are sorted & cooked. THEY SHOULD JUST REMOVE PASTA FROM THE GF MENU THE WAY THAT THEY HANDLE & PREPARE IT.  As far as I know, if you have Celiac Disease or allergies, you must ask to order from a manager there.  The GF salads & chocolate cheesecake seems safe considering possibility of contamination.

I've been in Atlanta for a little over 10 years and I'm taking the time to do a review. Not good. New to the Alpharetta area, I've noticed a disturbing trend with the food quality, preparation and presentation at TCCF at North Point. It seems to have changed about 2-3 years ago maybe but change it has. the Chinese chicken salad appeared to be shards and scraps off a well used carcass. No pieces were identical in texture or size. They were really just bits and pieces.  Really barely enough to identify it as a chicken salad. The dressing was not the usual consistency of the usual Plum dressing- not sure what's going on there, the bun on the sliders was pinched in the cover and noticeably so. A quick swap with a good bun would have gone a long way in presentation of food. I had take out and I did mention this to the VERY nice front staff. (it wasn't worth the extra time to wait for another bun for me. I didn't realize the chicken bits until driving home) My thoughts are- you have an award winning restaurant and good clientele. Why lose it over chicken bits, and squeezed buns. I don't normally write reviews, but I rely on them when I'm considering a new venue and thought this one rises to the occasion. Really, we all work hard and want to enjoy the infrequent times we are able to go out for dinner. This was not worth the money- on several occasions- and it's a shame for an industry that can do much better, not to maintain a standard of quality in their signature product- food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-alpharetta?start=200,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.9520000000000004,2.88

It had been a while since I'd been to the Cheesecake Factory and I was interested to see if the menu was still the same.      When we arrived, there was a 10 minute or so wait, which was less time than what I thought that it would be, being that we didn't have any reservations and it was a Friday night. Once seated, we were greeted by Apple, our waitress. She was nice and chatty, and made sure we were taken care off. She brought us a bread basket to share after taking our drink orders. I've heard that the brown bread is called whole wheat baguette and the lighter bread is sourdough. The whole wheat baguette is always good, but the sourdough bread?? Hard. As. A. Rock. I'll never eat it again.     The menu can be a little daunting, especially when the restaurant boasts that they have over 250 items made on a daily basis, and after going back and forth with what I wanted to order, I finally settled on a red sangria with the breaded Buffalo chicken strips, the alternative to their original Buffalo wings, because I didn't have the biggest appetite.They were covered in hot sauce and served with ranch dressing on the side and celery sticks. I'm not one to normally eat hot things, but the strips were pretty good. The red sangria was ok. I'll try the white one next time.   Overall, the food was good and so was the service.

I ordered a simple pasta dish and I had them place the sauce on the side.  Now, when you deconstruct a dish, each component should be able to stand on it's own.  The pasta was bland, the sauce was bland and I had to actually have the bland waitress come by with the fresh cheese in order to try and add some essence to the dish.  It didn't work.   This is that stereotypical restaurant that is more hype than substance and tends to cater to a very suburban palate, (largely individuals who don't have the time or desire to cook and have forgotten how good home made, well-seasoned food should taste).

28,Sara S.,"Fenton, MI",406,528,2023.0,3.0,2016-01-07,"If my review was based solely on cheesecake, this would be a five-star review, hands down. If there's one thing that the Cheesecake Factory is noted for, it's their stellar cheesecakes- from variety to taste, it's all sublime. For me, though, that's where the praise ends. Granted, if you've been to one Cheesecake Factory, you've pretty much been to all of them, right? That's true most of the time and this one is no real exception apart from the rather slow service. I don't get it, I know it's busy most of the time, but some of the wait times are just absurd. Every single time I'm back in Georgia, my sister drags me here because it's her favorite restaurant in the world (yes, I said it's her favorite in the entire world- she even dines here to celebrate her wedding anniversary every year). Every time, I know that my meal will be a long one in coming and I've yet to be proven wrong. Waiting a full hour for a pizza is wee bit much, but maybe I'm just being a crybaby or something. On top of that, sometimes the staff forgets to buss tables in a timely manner and tables are filled with dirty dishes for way too long while people languish by the door waiting to be seated. However, once you get your food (regular menu items, not the cheesecake, which is beyond reproach), it's pretty hit or miss. I've had both decent and not so amazing pizza and my tried and true greek salad has always been good, with crisp vegetables and delicious dressing, but the stuffed mushrooms were very meh, completely underwhelming and not at all what I was expecting. Honestly, I didn't care for either the texture or taste of them at all. Another time, I ordered a house salad that arrived with a bit of wilted greens with brown spots on it, so I sent it back and received a much-improved dish after an astonishingly brief wait (surprise, surprise).  Now for the cheesecake - the salted caramel is absolutely scrumptious with just the right balance of sweet and savory to make it the perfect dessert, but I'm still a sucker for the traditional plain variety, too. Both the Godiva and Oreo cheesecakes are so good, rich in both texture and taste. Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes really are heavenly and I've never found fault with any of their desserts (not at any Cheesecake Factory location, either) and doubt that I ever will.

We got there at 4 p.m. and had 11 ppl in our party. You would think that if the waiter needed help she would have asked for it, but she did not. It took her forever to get our drinks, bread, and especially dinner. They messed up my husbands order and gave his meal to someone else at our table and then the waitress didn't even tell us, but waited until I went to her and then she said the manager was coming over. 10 more minutes pass and I finally went and found the manager who asked if I knew the situation? I said no and told her this wasn't acceptable. The food was given to a member of our party so instead of just telling us, they made it such a huge secret and I had to end up sharing my food with my husband as his had to be made fresh. We were supposed to be out celebrating my sister in laws birthday and her pregnancy, but this long wait time and food mix up made it horrible. We all wished we had chosen somewhere else. And guess what, it took 3 hours for us to finish and I guarantee an hour or more was wasted on slow service and errors.

125,Chris D.,"Norcross, GA",0,3,,2.0,2016-06-13,"Upon entering this restaurant with my girlfriend, we were very impressed by how the place looked. It was big, colorful and lively. The restaurant was not too busy during the time that we arrived (which was noon), so we were seated quickly. The host and hostess were both very nice and kept a smile on throughout our experience. When our server arrived (who I do not wish to identify), the server greeted us with a smile and a menu as well. However, as time persisted, the server became evidently inattentive and seemed unhappy. My girlfriend and I ordered two appetizers and an entree. The appetizers came out fine, but the entree was not how we ordered it. In addition, the entree was missing one of the item that was mentioned inside the menu. As we waited for a while, our server walked by us multiple times, but I guess was too busy to check up on us (something that I understand, being a server myself). So my girlfriend had to try to get the server's attention to notify about the entree. The server's solution was to get the entree fixe for us. Unfortunately, we were late for a movie so we ended up having to request the bill from the host. We were transferred to the manager, which led us back to our server. In the end, we were given the bill with the entree taken off, but with no apologies from any of the staff members throughout the conflict.

We've had many family dinners - the ENTIRE FAMILY, both sides and in-laws - and birthday and graduation dinners here. And more regular dinners and Sunday brunches than I can remember.  Food is usually pretty great. And the desserts are unmatched.  But it has gone way downhill here in service. And it was made quite apparent to us Memorial Day weekend that Mr. Wendt shares no compassion for a ruined take-out order that customers must RETURN in person in order to prove TCF staff made the mistake.  Then after confiscating the receipt we were made to wait - in an almost 'move along we'll get to it when we're good and ready - nearly three weeks for a refund from the botched take-out. So like the many other complaints in this review thread, our family won't be returning to this TCF any time soon, unfortunately.

Whenever I have had the occasion to eat here I order the Avocado Egg Rolls and the Thai Lettuce Wraps.  I enjoy both dishes.  Well tonight was no different.  Both items were consistent and plenty of food.  In fact, we shared both items and had leftovers.  We had a child with us and he ordered the chicken fingers with fries.  His order was also very generous.  Our server Aaron was very attentive.  After dinner he suggested dessert, Cheesecake anyone??  Well I opted for the carrot cake.  Aaron came to the table with a HUGE piece of cake.  I was not a fan of the carrot cake and Aaron was kind enough to take it off the check.  By the way the coffee was delicious!!!

53,Rebecca E.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",115,106,497.0,2.0,2016-10-30,"UPDATED 3/9/2016 Used the DoorDash app to order some food. When my food arrived at my door, an item was missing. I called this location to see if it was sitting at the togo area so my driver could go back for it. I received the WORST customer service instead. The woman's name was Sheryl and she insisted that I contact DoorDash and inform them of the issue. She refused to just check (or have someone in the restaurant) check the Togo area. It was easier for her to just argue and be stubborn instead of giving me proper customer service and checking on my order. I just spent $60 on a few items. I could have gone somewhere else. After her annoying persistence on contacting DoorDash, i told my driver don't worry about it and I then called Cheesecake Factory back to speak with a manager. Kelly answered the phone and let Me know she ""understands why Sheryl didn't check the togo area because it all the way across the restaurant"". Really? Because I can't be transferred via phone to that area? You don't employ multiple employees that can walk over and check?  This entire scenario is NOT the way to keep clients visiting your establishment or ordering from an online app. From my experience below and now this one, any positive experience has now been deleted from my memory. NEVER AGAIN. I should have reread my previous review before ordering... PREVIOUS REVIEW THAT HAD 4 STARS: Came here for lunch last week and it was kind of busy but it was pretty outside so we sat on the patio. We were greeted by our server and we'll, that was it. 30 mins in we finally grabbed someone else inquiring about the teas we ordered (never mind our food at that point!)...he dropped off one tea for us to share. I waited about what I thought was ten more minutes and went to the hostess station asking for a manager. He walked back to where my table was and then said he would check on everything.  OUR FOOD WAS NEVER ORDERED. We were ready to leave but the manager urged us to stay and that he was buying our meal and just put the order in. At that point I didn't even care about the free food, where the heck was our server for almost an hour??? Don't tell me she got distracted by another table for an hour.  The only reason we stayed was because the weather was nice and the manager was pretty insistent about not leaving.  Can't say we will be back. It's not worth the risk of having piss poor service again. The only reason the 3 stars are there is because of the managers sense of urgency to fix the situation and our food was really good. We ordered the Cuban rolls, fried Mac n cheese, and the omelet with cheese, ham and avocado.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-alpharetta?start=40,2.32,2.64,2.64,2.216,2.512

Dynamite shrimp was a let down. Basically fried shrimp with remoulade on the side, meh. Spinach dip met mixed reviews. I wasn't impressed but others liked it fairly well. The main meal is where the wheels fell off. I chalk this place up to Gordon Ramsay' maxim that a restaurant with an extensive multi page menu can't possibly make it all fresh and do it well.  I got the French dip and it was so fatty I couldn't get past the third bite. Southwest salad had an odd mix of flavors that didn't work together for some reason. The gumbo, well, it ain't real gumbo. My son's medium well bacon cheeseburger was more of a charcoal briquette with slices of thinner charcoal on top. My daughter's kid cheese pizza smelled and tasted like chlorine, weird, right?

For my appetizer I ordered the ahi tartare, which was this chopped up raw tuna tossed with avocado and soy-ginger sesame sauce. It was served in a pool of the sauce, along with four crispy  nacho chips. The tuna was fine, tasted pretty fresh. However, the sauce was salty....really salty. I got hints of the sesame oil flavor, but the soy sauce really overpowered the rest of the appetizer, something easily avoided if the amount of soy sauce was reduced. Overall, it was a decent dish with good presentation. I ordered the shrimp and chicken gumbo as my entree. It was a stew of chunks of chicken and shrimp served with a bowl of rice in the middle. One word to describe it: heavy. It was too much for even a guy like me, I had to take about a fourth of it as takeout. It wasn't really because there was too much on the plate, there was a fair portion, but the amount of butter and thickness in the stew just made it really heavy. The gumbo was also a tad bit underseasoned, at least better than the salt lake of an appetizer I had. The chicken was cooked tender, and the shrimp had a fair texture as well.

9,Cheri R.,"Dawsonville, GA",6,21,10.0,1.0,2017-08-06,"On Sunday- July 30th- National Cheesecake day CF was offering the promo of 1/2 price cheesecake w the meal. My husband & I arrived around 4ish for dinner.  We placed our order for dinner after ordering a tea & appetizer. After a long wait 40 min. later, our food finally arrived at our table & it wasn't what we ordered. Our waitress asked the manager JOHN COOPER to come to our table in regards to the situation.  He finally came to the table, didn't introduce himself as the manager or anything. We conveyed to him the plates of food on the table were not what we ordered. He stood there looking at the food & then said, ""I'll take them off your bill"".  He didn't say ""I'M SORRY FOR THIS"" which a paying customer would expect or to perhaps be offered to have what we ordered remade... NOTHING. After we received our bill I asked him why was our bill still $24.66 assuming he would comp at least half our bill for the inconvenience of the long wait for our order & it being the wrong food, & having to leaving hungry. He said (as if it was a favor he was doing us) ""Well I deducted the price of the two meals you ordered and you are only charged for the appetizer & tea & you're already getting your cheesecake 1/2 off."" (because of the 1/2 off promo). My husband & I just looked at each other in disbelief. So we left after leaving the waitress a tip & paying our bill. We drove to another restaurant to get a meal.  The waitress Claire was very nice & kept checking on our order. I called the restaurant after I left to confirm the managers name --JOHN COOPER. He is not an asset to the company at all in my opinion. Surely not manager material.

We had a party of 10- they refused to sit us even though they had tables. Made us wait 40 minutes. We asked for the manager and explained a party of 10 gives you more $ than you seating singles one at a time (they had sat 3 singles in a row- where they could have joined tables and sat us.) He sat us after we pointed out his hostesses poor hostessing skills. 2. Sat us, finally, and we told the waitress to divide bill and add the birthday girl to each of us. Apparently they can only divide 4 ways (though we NEVER have a PROBLEM at any other restaurant) and we tip well knowing we are a party of 10. Well that wasn't going to work because it was 10 of us. They finally said they could only divide it by 9. Uh, what?!!? So we told them, fine do it by 9. They got it wrong. They had to re-do and reprint all the bills again.  Took over an hour to get our bills.... 3. Unpleasant experience when we were trying to take our birthday girl out to enjoy her birthday. They practically threw her cheesecake at us and ran. 4. We tipped the girl 18 to 20% even though her service was horrendous and I haven't even delved into it in this review nor will I bother you elaborating on it. 5.

We mentioned how we noticed she engaged in no conversation to ppl of color, but greeted and spoke to tables that werent. We told the manager and it was obvious she saw it too because she then went over and spoke to the table that was given the silent treatment by Courtney. Now, had she thought there was no merit to our observation, she would've spoken to the other tables being ""served"" by her. This location needs a customer service training. Not even the managers are up to cheesecake standards, based on the numerous locations we eat at nationwide.  This isn't too be mean, but to hope they better their service.

Then we waited for 4 waters for another 10 minutes. Server acted like we were inconveniencing her. We ordered and when the food arrived two meals were Burnt and I ordered a flat bread and I received an entire pizza. After the server dropped our meals off we did not see her for another 15 or 20 minutes to check on Meals. My friend sent his back and by that point the rest of us were about through eating. What's the point in remaking his meal when we were all done. Then some kid manager came over and didn't even know how to handle the situation.

37,Alyson R.,"Roswell, GA",0,3,,1.0,2017-08-28,"Terrible service at the Bar.  Got there on Saturday at a little after 3 pm and NO ONE was seated at the bar besides myself.  No staff was behind the bar either.  A few minutes later, a bartender came over, said hello, and took my order.  Very simple - a club soda and a hot appetizer.  He entered the order immediately, and took care of a couple who just sat down.  For the next twenty minutes, he carried on a full conversation with the couple, who got their food, while I was still waiting on mine.  No one even cared that I was sitting there for 20 minutes with no appetizer - I had to ASK him to please check on my food.  A couple of minutes later, the app came out and it was tepid - not even lukewarm.  Obviously no one let him know the order was up, or if he knew, he just let it sit there getting cold.  I told him the food was cold, and a manager came by to apologize and said he would reenter the order, and it would be ""on him"".  I waited another 20 minutes, and no food.  One other customer came to the bar and ordered (and got) his food and drink.  Still no appetizer.  I finally walked out.  There was not even a bartender at the bar for several minutes for me to ask to check this time.  He was off doing other things,  I guess.  You'd think the bartender or manager would be extra mindful of a customer who just had a bad experience, to constantly check on my food and bring it out to me immediately after it was ready, and then make sure I was happy?  Not so.  Took 40 minutes with no appetizer.  This is unacceptable.  I have been to the Perimeter location hundreds of times and the bar is packed with customers ordering complicated drinks, customized entrees, desserts, etc., and the staff are always delightful and attentive, and the food always comes out hot and exactly as ordered.  The staff pay attention to all the customers, not just the ones they wish to chat to. The North Point location can't even handle 3 people at the bar at the same time when the place was so slow? This is not the first time I've experienced deplorable service and long waits at this location, but it is the last time I will ever visit.  I will drive to the Perimeter location next time I'm in the mood for CF, even though it is farther from my home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-alpharetta?start=60,2.28,2.37,2.37,,2.334

Couple items that I usually get here that I like are the Miso Salmon, Santa Fe Salad, Asian Lettuce Taco's, Chicken Dumplings, and Hazelnut Crunch Cheesecake.

I initially called for curbside service but somehow the hold time on the phone was terrible so I decided to just go ahead in. The place was packed. It could've been due to the fact that it was New Year's Day. It took about 30 from placing my order to receive my food. I will start with the good food first. The samosas were amazing. The cheesecake was very rich. Now onto the not so good.... the teriyaki chicken was drowning in sauce. The sauce overwhelmed the chicken. My friend couldn't even finish it.  The Cajun chicken jambalaya was by far the worst I have ever had. The chicken was seasoned perfectly. The pasta was NOT seasoned at all.

My visit was a 2-star one, but I have faith in their food and enclosing booths so I'll give it to them. Food: I would not recommend the honey chipotle chicken pasta. The lunch portion is definitely plentiful, though the price is definitely high enough to reflect that. The sauce did have A flavor, but I'm not sure what flavor exactly it was going for - it needed to either be smokier or spicier or something. They cut the asparagus into finger-length pieces but left the chewy stalks in there so I found myself spitting into a napkin. The pasta itself was al dente and I've enjoyed it in other meals. Dessert: We did not get dessert this time, but I have two comments: 1) Eight dollars for a slice of cheesecake!?!?!? 2) The oreo one is my go-to favoriteeee because every bite is magic. Service: While we didn't have any issues with the service, it wasn't particularly special during the lunch hour. The waitresses we had were certainly polite and well-trained for our order and requests, but it was a bit too bustling for them to really feel personable. Seating: The issue with going during the busy times is that the tables that have booths along one side are entirely too close together, so you feel like you are a part of your neighbors' conversations. I had come to have a specific conversation with my lunch date that I didn't end up getting to, and I also had our neighbors chiming in giggles to some of my comments (which I don't blame them for).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-alpharetta,2.64,2.47,2.47,,2.5380000000000003
