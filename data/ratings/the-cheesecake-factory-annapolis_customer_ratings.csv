125,Igor B.,"Bowie, United States",0,44,6.0,3.0,2012-03-09,"We had a good dinner here, and the service was good.  Like many chain restaurants, not big on atmosphere, in spite of the fancy decor.  It's a cavernous place, like a factory, and apparently quite popular.  Reminds me of the glorified New Jersey diners I can remember, but much, much better.  A very extensive menu, and they seem to do it all well.  Good selection of cheesecakes for dessert, of course.  I'm curious about trying some of their other menu items, to get a better idea of how well this restaurant's seemingly well-developed system really works, and how the various other cuisines on the menu come out.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=140,3.36,3.36,3.36,3.0200000000000005,3.3600000000000003

The portions here are huge and there's no way you'd be able to finish it.  So, even though it's expensive, you get to have another meal out of it. I tried a Mojito and was not overly impressed.  I'm looking for something that has brown sugar in it,with crushed mint leaves.  Not sugar syrup.  Far too sweet!!

90,Donna O.,"Greater Upper Marlboro, United States",14,6,2.0,2.0,2012-11-22,"Longest wait ever. No reservations available although it says they accept them online. Besides that my family and I had an almost awesome waitress, Genie. She was energetic and definitely had personality but she was so rushed that she missed the simple things like refilling drinks, and our frantic waving trying to get her attention. Additionally the kitchen was off.  The food was either too salty or had sweetness that it wasn't supposed to have. This was by far one of the worst experiences I ever had at a cheesecake factory. I will not be returning to this particular franchise. It was my send week in a row going there (trying to give them the benefit of the doubt) but the service and kitchen were even worse this time around. I'd go elsewhere.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=100,3.56,3.56,3.56,2.9200000000000004,3.5600000000000005

117,Kanani S.,"Santa Rosa, United States",69,232,85.0,3.0,2013-01-04,"I always love the Cheesecake Factory - this one was ok. The food was good and in the beginning the service seemed to be fast. Our appetizers and drinks came out fairly quickly but our main dishes took WAY too long to come out, about 30-40 minutes after our appetizers. My friend and I were put in the corner kind of hiding from the main dinning hall and pretty much forgotten about. Our meals were 2 simple pasta dishes. Our waitress was ok, she didn't seem to attentive as she walked past our table 2-3 times before finally letting us know 30 min later our food would be out shortly. The place wasn't busy so I'm not sure what happened and why our food took so long.

67,Kelly G.,"Washington, DC, United States",643,1117,2185.0,3.0,2013-01-16,"What everyone who wants to go to this restaurant at prime time should do is: Pull up front, send in a person from your party to put your name on list + get your pager. THEN go park. Shortens the wait. Or it seems like it shortens the wait.  That is not what we did. We pulled up front. Unloaded my father into his wheelchair, walked in, put our name on the list, were told it was a two hour wait, were told to come back in an hour to get a pager, and then left to go shopping. In the end, it all worked out but it just was not optimal. The food and decor here are just like every Cheesecake Factory you've ever been in (or just like any Grand Lux Cafe (Vegas) you've ever been in). The servers here are trained in the same corporate niceness as every other Cheesecake Factory or Grand Lux Cafe server you've ever been served by. And the line cooks in the back use the same techniques to dish up the same gigantic portions as every other Cheesecake factory you've ever been in. And it is good.

88,Heather G.,"Annapolis, United States",9,18,,4.0,2013-01-28,"I'll get the negative out of the way first: if you're not at a booth, then you're packed like sardines into narrow, crowded tables, practically knocking elbows with your neighbors. You can end up waiting a while for a table unless you go well out of the normal rush hours, and there aren't a lot of places to wait. As is to be expected from the packed tables and the wait, this is a rather noisy restaurant. Also, this is definitely not a cheap place to eat. That said, I do love going here once in a while as a treat. Whether you're in T-shirt and jeans or a dress/suit, you won't feel out of place. The decor is kinda fun, and the waitstaff are friendly and attentive. The menu has an extremely wide variety of drinks, eats, and desserts, so no matter what your tastes you're likely to find something here. The avocado eggrolls are a fave, along with the sweet corn tamale cakes. There's pizza, pasta, burgers, salads, sandwiches, and just about everything in between. My favorite part of the menu, however, is the ""small plates."" If you like variety, get a bunch of these to share around the table. From mini crab cake bites, to stuffed mushrooms, to some delicious salads and crunchy fried things, there's a wonderful array of delicious little foods. Also, if you have a small appetite (most of their portions are huge!) then this is a nice way to not overstuff yourself. As nice as the cheesecakes are, I rarely get one for dessert here. They make fantastic milkshakes with a touch of liqueur in them that are just wonderful, in all sorts of flavors (the flying gorilla is one of my faves, if I'm remembering the name right). They also have some very nice fruit smoothies. If you come here for cheesecake, though, they have an amazing variety of delicious flavors. Whenever I do get cheesecake, I always end up having to get it to go. Everything is just so filling here! (And did I mention those huge portions?!)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=100,3.36,3.36,3.36,3.12,3.3600000000000003

He was not nearly as charming as I had first stated and the service was slow.  Maybe I caught him on a bad day this time or maybe I had just caught him on a great day before.

86,Sarah M.,"Fort Meade, United States",64,102,14.0,5.0,2013-05-18,"I guess I can't write a new review...so this one is going to have to cover 2 visits. My friend has a strange allergy- canola oil- which is found in many things. Many of which you might not expect! The first visit, we communicated this to our server, who was very helpful and immediately asked one of the main chefs to come out personally. He came out right away and was very friendly- my friend let him know which dinner options she was most interested in, and he spent a few minutes discussing how he could make these without canola oil for her, and how he would personally make the dish himself and cook it separately to make it canola-free! We ordered and our food was out in less than 10 minutes- the chef who made it came out to check on her just a few minutes after we had started eating. He was animated and friendly, and so wanted her to enjoy her dinner without having to worry! It was a great success and she was able to enjoy her artichokes without any issues. My sliders were AAAHHHHMazing!! They were seriously fantastic and I was so happy to have ordered them- maybe because he made them too, so they were as hot, fresh, and delicious as could be? In any case, they were awesome! The second visit, I came back with the same friend. We asked for that chef again, but he wasn't working, so the server offered to ask another chef. I can't remember his name, but he was a very tall black man, who came up to us smiling and very charming. Again, he listened to her concerns, but not knowing exactly how his colleague had prepared her artichokes last time, he offered a few different options that all sounded good. He had a lot of ideas! We told him that we love Food Network and that he was welcome to experiment if he wanted to and ""go all Food Network on us,"" because we were sure she'd love whatever he brought out.  He seemed so excited to have the freedom to make what he wanted! Her artichokes again, were super delicious. He came out a few minutes later, hesitant and hoping that she'd loved them. When she told him how delicious they were, he was beaming! Apparently, he hasn't been able to have that much fun in the kitchen (at work) since culinary school! It was a great experience, both times, and I'm convinced that of all the CCFs in the area, this is the one that sets the standard. I've only had one negative experience here and I spoke with the manager when it happened, The rest of the time, we have really been well taken care of, and we will definitely return! The only suggestion I have is that they somehow put in a microcell or something, because there is nearly no cell signal inside the restaurant. Which is fine... unless you're using the mall's free childcare option to enjoy a bite to eat sans children. They couldn't get ahold of my friend, because we were dining inside CCF and the line wouldn't go through when her child was crying and they needed her to come pick him up. But that's a minor thing!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=100,3.4,3.4,3.4,3.2520000000000002,3.4000000000000004

When I was acknowledged I was told it would be a 15 minute wait. The waiting area had to be around 85+ degrees. While waiting for our table, we were able to listen to the hosts discuss their ""boob sweat"" and watched each one fan themselves with menus that were eventually given to customers.

I always order the Ahi Carpacio as an appetizer. It's always so fresh and delicious! Its the best choice they have. I highly recommend trying it! As a meal I love there skinnylicious Cesar salad. You wouldn't even know its healthy! It has a ton of flavor! Of course there bread is delicous, especially the sweet brown one.

Anyway....unlike most CCF's, we weren't made to wait for a table (no matter how many empty tables there are they always make you wait, just like Olive Garden) and our service was fast, efficient and friendly.  I do like that they have a fairly big selection of ""healthier"" choices but you still need to be sensible. Ordering a ""under 500 calorie"" app plus a ""under 600 calorie"" entree still equals a lot of calories. They don't post individual calorie counts per item so you just have to guess that the turkey burger is better for you than the ""healthy taco plate"".  Speaking of my turkey burger, it looked like it might have been hand formed & the taste was above average.

That's not a complaint, just an observation -- which, means that people like the place. It's funny. I spend what seems like a half hour going through the menu everytime I go, but I always seem to settle for one of few of the same items time and time again. I really like the Thai Lettuce Wraps -- I've been tempted to order like three plates of them and just make that my dinner. Their burgers are very good -- second best in the area in my expert opinion. Many other menu items I've tried have spanned the spectrum between good and great. It's hard to go wrong. OK, the biggest star on the menu is the first thing you select, but the last thing you eat -- DESSERT! Pack an extra vile of insulin or whatever you need to do and just have DESSERT! My biggest complaint is that I can't get AT&T cellphone service in the blasted place! I can't post a picture of my stacked burger or seven thousand calorie tower of cheesecake until I get in the car!

First, a group of 3 and I waited for a table, which was not an issue, but when were seated our server came to our table only 3 times, to take the order, leave drinks  and check without us asking. A table across was receiving more attention than ours.  Second,I ordered the Jamaican black pepper shrimp with rice and mango salsa. The shrimp and mango salsa were good but It was forgettable.  Third, I enjoyed and savored the Passionfruit Margarita and happy it was prepared with real tequila, Milagro not Patron, which people only buy because they're commercially told to.  Fourth, I enjoyed the Godiva Cheesecake,  very good!  Our bill came up to $70.00, not bad at all for a table of 4. I really wish the server would have communicated with us a bit more. I hope she didnt think we weren't going to tip because we were Latinos or maybe because we were Latinos, idk.

124,Mocha Mama M.,"Bowie, United States",0,1,,1.0,2014-08-13,"I am writing to make known the horrifying experience I had yesterday afternoon at The Cheesecake Factory. My family of six ventured to Cheesecake to celebrate my daughter's birthday, but our experience and her day was ruined by the disrespectful way our waitress treated our party, especially me. First, we sat longer than usual before we received our complementary bread. Our waitress came to the table to take our drink order and again for our food orders, and never mentioned bringing bread and took her time deciding to bring some (After my later experiences with her, I guess she wanted to make sure Black folks were actually going to order something before they were approved for the free stuff . . . anyway.). I made known when the waitress took our order what items were to come as appetizers and which should come with the entrees because there were a couple of items from the appetizer list that would serve as entrees. After waiting about 20 minutes for the salad and crispy fried cheese, I stopped our waitress and said I wanted to check in on the appetizers. She curtly responded, ""Well, they have to cook it"" (As if I don't know that food has to be cooked). I was taken aback by her shortness, especially since it was only a small side salad and cheese sticks, which I've never known to take a long time to make.  She shows up five minutes later with cold cheese sticks (which means they had been ready a long time ago), the side salad, and the entrees. As she was passing out food I reminded her that I had just asked her about the appetizers, which she had implied weren't ready, and now she was bringing them with the entrees, defeating the purpose of an appetizer, which should precede the main course. As I was trying to explain myself and why I inquired about the appetizers and why I thought her previous remark was out of place, she interrupted me several times, got loud, and ordered the waiters helping her deliver the meals back to the kitchen, leaving my entire family, including my three hungry children and elderly parents (one disabled), with no food. At this point, my daughter is upset about what's going on, and our waitress and food have disappeared without an explanation. The manager appears 10 minutes later, and I briefly explain to him my issue. He never asks my name; he never apologizes. He asked if I had the food I was supposed to have and if everything was okay, now. I informed him that things were not okay, that we didn't have our food, and that our appetizers arrived cold--after waiting a lengthy time for them. I also informed him that my family dined at the restaurant at least 3 times a month and that the waitress that he reassigned us could attest to my frequency, which she did. He also said that he'd recognized me. However, I informed him that he would not be seeing my family's faces anymore, and that everyone I knew, on every social media account that I have would be informed about my experience. He said that we'd get a new waitress, which we did. However, the previous waitress made it a point to stop at the aisle in front of me several times, make eye contact, and smirk at me. As I began to observe her interactions with her White customers, I realized that she had pleasantries and patience, but she seemed to think African Americans were beneath her. I witnessed her yell at and berate an African American busboy in front of others, as well. I am completely disgusted with my experience at Cheesecake.  I am so appalled by this experience and the manager who seemed to condone it by his lack of apology, his lack of showing any visual concern about my having to endure such treatment from a staff member, and his failure to address his employee and her actions. I certainly would have expected an apology for how I was treated, but he obviously condoned her treated of non-White patrons. Business went on as usual, and at the end the day, we still received our bill, without so much as a happy birthday to my daughter who had to witness such nonsense. It is unfortunate that in 2014 my African American family cannot go into a restaurant and expect to be treated in a dignified, respectful manner.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=140,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.9800000000000004,3.2800000000000002

73,Joe C.,"Bowie, United States",5,32,4.0,4.0,2015-07-21,"I ate here over the weekend.  I love this chain and its novel-length menu, but my number one recommendation for every restaurant I've ever reviewed is to only go in their off-hours.  For any Cheesecake Factory attached to a mall (which has been all of the ones i've ever been to), this means steer clear of Fridays-Sundays.  Only go between 2pm-4pm Monday through Thursday.  We came at about 3pm on a Sunday, and wrongly assumed that at such an odd hour, it wouldn't matter that it was still technically the weekend.   Our wait was only about 15 minutes, but the hostess hadn't asked us how many were in our party; she saw two of us while our third was on a phone call outside, and assumed two.  So when our pager went off as a table for 2 had opened up, they crammed us into the section of a different waitress who was already in the weeds.  She was friendly, but it was almost fifteen minutes after being seated that we finally got our drinks; in fact our bar drinks were delivered by a bartender before I got my iced tea.  My empty glass sat for more than five minutes at a time throughout the meal.   I asked a food runner to bring me a refill, and her response clearly reflected that she was either new or also in the weeds herself: ""I got other things to do.""  I'm a prior food service man, so I understand that food runners are supposed to take stuff from the expediter and get it to the tables, and aren't the ones you ask for sides of mayo or to put in another appetizer order, but she COULD have gotten my refill as we were seated right next to the server station.  I could've poured it myself if I wanted to break from propriety. The food was as good as any other time I've eaten there, with one exception. I am a fond admirer of appetizers that wrap foods in other foods and fry them; my favorite here is Tex-Mex Eggrolls.  I had to wonder if these hadn't been properly wrapped (assuming they wrap them in-house), because even after they had been brought to the table, I bit into my third one or so and was greeted with scalding hot oil on the inside of the egg roll. When they were fried, a good amount of deep-fry oil must have gotten trapped inside and remained boiling hot even ten minutes after coming out of the fryer.  I will still order them every time I go here, but shame on you fry cook! My enchiladas were delicious.  Not as good as I make at home, but for the convenience and price, they will keep me from ever having to make them.  One of my dining companions got the  Shrimp Gumbo over rice and cleaned his plate.  I can't remember what my other companion got, but she talked us into NOT getting cheesecake for dessert, in lieu of carrot cake.  I kid you not, carrot cake!!  Get the cheesecake, America.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=80,3.72,3.72,3.72,3.024,3.7200000000000006

I'm guessing since it was a thin crowd and one of the servers had enough time to watch at least ten minutes of the game that eventually someone would surface. The bartender came back (I guess from a break) and she was pleasant and helpful in her suggestions for late night noshing. I wanted fish but didn't want to be overly full since it was after 8p. I got the catfish, mashed red potatoes, corn and green beans. I immediately knew that I'd be eating the other half of this for lunch the next day.

Our server, Elizabeth, went well above the call of duty for us. She even brought us to-go cups of strawberry lemonade when we were leaving, without us even thinking to ask her. She threw out a few suggestions for us and gave us her personal opinion on a couple of food options.  We couldn't have asked for a better server.  We ordered the fried mac and cheese for an appetizer and they were phenomenal! I'm upset it was only four on the plate, so I only ate one.  SIGH!  I ordered a basil and chicken pasta dish that was really good.  Everyone else ordered cheesecake and I ordered a few slices to take home to my parents and they enjoyed it.

Once we got seated is when it all went downhill. Our server was friendly enough, but very inattentive. Drinks came out one by one and then sat empty for long periods of time. It was close to 15 minutes after we sat down before he finally stopped at the table long enough to take our lunch order.  After putting in our order, we waited for our food for around 45 minutes. Why we sat there that long I will never know. Our waiter rarely checked in on us, again, drinks remained empty. Bread basket, empty.  When the food finally arrived, it was absolutely not worth the wait. My better half ordered an omelette, toast and potatoes. The toast was burnt, the omelette was tiny and horrible tasting. My son got the mini corn dogs and he seemed to enjoy them.  I ordered the Mac n cheese burger. Which was awful. The Mac n cheese was basically flavorless mush. I asked for my burger to be done ( a risky move, I know). What I got was a burnt, shriveled chunk of meat. Inedible without loads of ketchup. I also ordered sweet potato fries in place of regular fries. Initially they sent out the wrong fries.

The ambiance is always enjoyable, the lighting is my absolute favorite! As far as food choices, there are TONS of selections. Although, I've been a couple of times, I still find myself having to look over the menu a couple times before ordering. The buffalo wings are classic appetizer and their blue cheese is really good. (Which is actually sold at the front of you wanted to take some home). The calamari is also good. As far as entrees, I usually go for the the steak tacos, chicken Cobb salad or the Cajun pasta. You can never go wrong with either selection.  Desserts...where do I start? If you are a regular at Cheesecake you know that the selections are epic and it would be so much easier to ask to try everything. However, if you had to choose per say, the red velvet cheesecake is to die for!! The snickers in my opinion is right after that!

Also large are the portions whether it be a salad, iced tea, pasta dish or slice of cheesecake. The atmosphere here is ok.  I've never understood the decor that Cheesecake factory uses and how it relates to the restaurant but that isn't an issue.  I do wish the tables were a little farther apart because sometimes the high density of people, coupled with many hard services, can make it very loud in here.  Unless you have an empty table next to you, there isn't an opportunity for private conversation here.   The cheesecake here is good, but some flavors are certainly better than others.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=40,3.28,3.42,3.42,2.6399999999999997,3.3640000000000003

Very friendly, quick and efficient. I ordered the Hibiscus lemonade as my beverage, which was highly recommended by our waitress& it was phenomenal! It had a very fresh and flavorful floral taste, in addition to earthy hints!  The food took a while to come out, but it was well worth the wait. As my main dish I ordered the Baja Tacos and man oh man, lets just say that they didn't last for more than 5 minutes!

Totally unacceptable. I've brought  this to the attention of the hostess as well as management and have heard everything from shift changes to kitchen and computer being down offered as an excuse several  times in a 3 month period.

Additionally, I've noticed 2 party's who have been seated well after me have gotten there food before me on various occasions. This time, once the food finally came, it was off and the plate missing a side that is usually there. The concession offered was insulting at best, and I'm a regular, the times this has happened before nothing. Certainly not looking for a hand out but rather my food, as ordered, in a timely fashion -without excuse- and not have to wander about looking for resolve or to call the waitress back asking why the Jamaican shrimp has 0 shrimp but instead chicken?! After all the wait, It as passed off like I wouldn't notice- again insulting, communicate if something is out so I can make other choice at my discretion, not yours!!!

I have been to. We were seated right away, but it went downhill from there... Service was really bad, it took forever to get our food order--Our server was so slow and not friendly at all. I asked him to take our group's photo and he said he will be back, but of course he did not return, only when he had to give the bill.  Food sucked!

Hostess was nice upon entering but immediately noticed how dirty the restaurant was. Why was their trash visibly on the floor? The bathrooms trash can was also overflowing. The worst of it all was the table we were seated at- there was a glass salt shackled that had broken on the floor. I asked three times for someone to come and clean it- they didn't. It wasn't until my niece got a small piece stuck in her thigh while she was seated in the booth section- I guess the shaker smashed all over. They need to take their time and clean all areas of the restaurant and tables after a party has left. The manager did come over and made sure we were okay but didn't do a thing other than give us a bandaid and antiseptic.  Mind you this all happened while we waited well over an hour for our food! That's crazy. The waitress was good and she wasn't to blame for anything. I really liked the flavor of the shrimp and pineapple chicken Asian dish except for the white rice- it was horrible- Chinese takeout rice is better. Parts of it was hard and dried out. You should at least be using jasmine rice and a nice rice cooker.

I bit into something that I initially thought was the rice noodle garnish, but I decided to take it out of my mouth because it felt slightly harder and scraped the roof of my mouth the wrong way. It turns out, it was a metal wire of some sort. Not just a twist tie, this was some serious gauge metal that could've caused considerable damage to my intestinal tract. I'm betting it's from their frying baskets that they cook fried food in. Regardless of where it came from, I hope that this location improves its safety procedures to avoid such incidents.

My mom and I ordered the same gluten free pasta dish I always get. It came out and looked very different. I asked the waitress if they changed the recipe and she said no. It was tasteless and extremely liquidly. The waitress asked if we liked it and we explained that we thought it was terrible but we were hungry and in a time crunch so we would eat it. Very nicely she called over the manager, who said yea that looks different I'll take it back to get fixed. At that point I said I didn't have the 20 min to wait and I no longer wanted it. He took the plate and left. Terrible business sense, a good restaurant would have at least offered a free dessert for the inconvenience. We ordered a piece of gluten free and regular cheesecake to go home. As I was eating it, I realized they cut it in half with a contaminated knife and now my mom and I are violently ill. Poor management and most of all poor quality food.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=40,2.76,3.22,3.22,,3.0360000000000005
148,Iris D.,"Annapolis, United States",2,24,39.0,1.0,2017-09-30,"Positive: The variety of cheesecake and the extensive menu of food. My favorite to order is the salmon option -- grilled with 2 sides of vegetables or the miso salmon with rice. Both choices are great; however, I've experienced a few times where the salmon doesn't taste fresh. I contacted the manager and they were able to assist in changing my order. I've tried other choices such as the fish tacos, variety of pastas, salads, etc. on the menu and not one stood out beyond ordinary. Negative: Long wait up to 45 minutes especially dinner time on the weekends; they don't offer reservations so it's on a first come, first serve basis. Also, finding parking can be a pain. The service is also a hit or miss and so is the quality of the food. The most unfortunate is the  cheesecake size; it has gotten smaller in size over the years (30%-40% reduction in size, but yet prices keeps increasing). So disappointing. But the worse is the....Eek! We saw a baby ROACH on the floor. It went inside a hole on the wall before I was able to kill it. There's a possible cockroach infestation behind those walls. Yuck. Filth. Rating went down from a 2 to a big fat 0 because of this. It maybe a long time before I return. Gross.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis,2.76,3.19,3.19,,3.018

24,Lucy C.,"Severna Park, United States",0,5,3.0,1.0,2017-11-02,My family and I don't usually indulge in cheesecake but we decided upon getting some from here the other night. We were excited to eat the slices we bought but we're immensely disappointed to find that they were dry and unenjoyable. Certainly not worth the cost per slice. The next day we returned to the store to speak with the manager about the quality of the product and to maybe get our money back- we certainly didn't want another piece of cheesecake after our terrible experience- and he told us that they sold thousands of slices a day and never got any complaints. Terrible customer service. We will not be returning to this establishment again. If you want a good dessert check out The Main Ingredient or other delicious non-chain restaurants in the Annapolis area.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=40,2.76,3.17,3.17,,3.006
15,Natasha W.,"Annapolis, United States",14,2,,1.0,2017-11-15,"I normally love this location, but our server (Sydney) was awful. I have worked in many restaurants and I know how servers should treat guest. She only came to the table twice, and ignored us when we called. She never checked in on our table. She was very lazy and not enthusiastic at all. The food took 40 minutes to come and that was not the issue. The problem was that she never updated us on the food or apologized for the inconvenience. The restaurant was not that busy, nor was there a wait. We ordered a second glass of wine and Cydney never brought it out, never acknowledged the birthday that we mentioned (it was my mother's birthday). The table next to us spoke to the manager about her and their over cooked steak (we did not speak to the manager about ours though).",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=20,2.68,3.13,3.13,,2.9499999999999997

The music was extremely loud and added to the loud conversation made the hearing level painful. We were told we were waiting for the bread to come out of the oven, but the bread that reached our table had been out of the oven for an awfully long time. I ordered the chicken enchiladas which I have enjoyed in the past. There were a few burned spots on the enchiladas but at that point I was too hungry to bother complaining. We will be removing the Cheesecake Factory from our normal rotation of restaurants for a while in the hope that they can return to previous excellence.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=20,2.68,3.12,3.12,,2.9440000000000004

Normally no problem but this particular group was loud and vulgar. I went to the front and told the girl working it needed to be addressed I wasn't going to listen to ""F you and God D"" my entire lunch. I went back to my seat for this to continue and no one bothered to even come over and ask them to keep it down. The last few times we've been in it's been one thing or another...rude staff, cold food, being out of items (which happened again today, how do you just open and you're out of food?)

146,Kimberly J.,"Baltimore, United States",122,222,296.0,4.0,2017-11-27,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory location at least twice before this visit and it has been pretty good. The food is good and the service is excellent. However, this most recent visit, my food was not the best. I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, one of my favorite pasta dishes from here. The peppers and mushrooms were burnt. I probably should have sent it back but I was starving and didn't feel like waiting for them to remake it. I just removed the burnt parts and ate the pasta. My boyfriend ordered the Factory Burrito Grande and that was as great as always.  Our server was great. He was very attentive and friendly. When we left, my boyfriend left his hat and the server ran behind us to make sure we got the hat. I honestly think it was just a busy day and the kitchen  just made a mistake.

147,Cam C.,"Washington, DC, United States",68,74,275.0,2.0,2017-12-11,"My family and I come here all the time. The service at this location is inconsistent. Our most recent visit was the worst experience yet. Our waitress had a horrible attitude and looked annoyed the entire time! She barely communicated with us. Her poor attitude and lack of communication caused multiple issues: We asked for certain items to be separated on our bill, and before we could tell her which items should be charged to which debit cards, she takes our debit cards and abruptly walks away. And as one would expect, she charged the wrong items to the wrong cards. When you have an attitude like our waitress did, I guess you don't care about your customers' finances.  With my brunch combo, I asked for fried eggs cooked hard. They brought out scrambled eggs instead. Not a big deal. I do like scrambled eggs, but it's not what I asked for. By the time they brought out the correct eggs, I was basically done with the rest of my food. I'm not sure if our waitress or the cook is at fault for this, but regardless it was an inconvenience.  After we finished eating, I asked for a burger to-go. At the time I didn't even think to mention that I wanted it well done, because usually a GOOD waiter/waitress will ask how you want your burger cooked. It wasn't until I got home that I realized my burger had pink in it. This lets you know that the waitress decided on behalf of me, instead of being honest and going back to me to see how I wanted it cooked.  This was the first time we've had this particular waitress, and I certainly hope it is the last. On a positive note, all of our food was delicious as always. Also, the wait for a table was pretty short (about 10 minutes) for a Sunday afternoon.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis,2.56,3.04,3.04,,2.8480000000000003

All I asked was how much longer until my table would be seated, and instead of being kind, the hostess replied by saying we had only waited partial of our presumed wait, not all of it yet. I don't understand why she had to be so rude when I nicely asked what our wait time was. Not to mention we had already been waiting an hour. My party asked again, and they continued to extend our time past what the originally stated. l will not be bringing my service back, and I am not happy with the service anyway.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis,2.36,3.03,3.03,,2.7619999999999996
