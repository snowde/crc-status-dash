(it comes with creamy sauce and mustroom)  2) Fried Calamari (very yum, I love their garlic sauce, I always ask for more) 3) Baked Potato Soup (only for Wednesday, really delicious) 4) Cream Chicken soup (only for Saturday, my favor) 5) Avocado eggrolls (eat with the garlic sauce from fried calamari) 6) Miso Salmon (this is my friend's favor, to me, I feel like it's just a simple salmon steak) Their wheat breads are complimentary and they are warm and YUM. The price is okay comparing to other American type of foods.

841,Will T.,"Torrance, CA",198,95,11.0,1.0,2012-01-12,"Pro-Tip: There's an additional parking lot in the back that you can park in that's very close to the Cheesecake Factory. If I could leave a 0-star review I would and it's because of the General Manager, Justin Park. I find it very disturbing that someone in charge of the restaurant would be so rude and careless about customer service. I even told him that he should be fired and he agreed with me! I might expect that kind of apathy from a busser, but not the manager. Justin Park's actions were disgusting. I came here with my family (including my wheelchair bound grandmother) for a New Year's dinner. Apparently while I was in the restroom, there was a server switch. What resulted was us not getting service for over 20 minutes. We had to ask random people walking by for utensils and water refills. Finally someone in my family told me what had happened that I was finally able to talk to our new server and get better service.  Before Christmas, my girlfriend and I had also come in and bought a lot of cheesecakes for a Christmas party we were going to. We each decided on a piece that we wanted and took it with us. When we tried to eat it the next day, we noticed that they tasted funny, mostly the whipped cream. I called in and was told that if I brought them back that I could get them exchanged. When I gave them to my server, she was very nice and told me that I would have them waiting for me after dinner. Instead, I got Justin Park. He walked up to our table and stood right over my grandmother and stared down at us. He asked me for my receipt. Unlike him, I do not walk around carrying every receipt that I've ever received. I also doubt that I could have picked up Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes from anywhere else other than the Cheesecake Factory. He told me that he would not be exchanging my cheesecakes. The entire time, he was harassing my grandmother with his presence as I could see her becoming agitated. When I brought the slow service problem to the attention of Justin Park, his simple response was that they had a server switch. No apologies, no explanations. A rude ""this is how it is and that's that"". I exchanged a few more works with him and finally told him to leave so he wouldn't bother my grandmother anymore. I now have a very negative perception of Cheesecake Factory because one manager decided 2 pieces of Cheesecake were worth harassing a family over. I tipped more to my server than the value of those 2 pieces of cake. JUSTIN PARK SHOULD BE FIRED!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=680,3.8,3.62,3.62,2.404,3.692
150,Alan K.,"Monterey Park, CA",472,653,10.0,4.0,2012-01-15,"The Cheesecake Factory never really disappoints whenever I come here. The food here is not superb, but they have quite a selection most of which is of high quality. I think the prices here match what they give you, especially since the portions here are pretty huge.  FOOD QUALITY: Of all the food that I've ordered here, they all come in big sizes and there is a certain richness to every item.  Factory Meatloaf is one thing that I usually get -- there's three slices of meatloaf, served with gravy, grilled onions and mushrooms. Alongside that are slightly buttered mash potatoes and peppered corn & bell pepper bits. Meatloaf is soft and full of flavor. Mash potato melts in your mouth and helps break down the meatloaf bits, while the corn gives you a slight crunch from the plumpness. Pastas are usually not a letdown since they do slightly different things that you would not normally find in a restaurant (unless you order the basic things.. which I avoid) Louisana Chicken was one of my recent discoveries and that was delicious! Cajun style bowtie pasta with flaky fried chicken. Pasta cooked to perfection and the flakiness from the chicken definitely added a lovely subtle texture of crunch into the pasta. Flavors were strong, but was definitely oily. Other pastas are pretty good (Farfalle and the chipotle liguini are the two others that I tried) Fish and Chips were pretty good too, but not the best I've had.  Marsala Chicken was also good, but there was a lot of bowtie pasta that came along with that.  SERVICE: Is usually friendly, polite, and attentive. They offer to refill your waters, oblige to give you more bread, and sometimes the manager comes around to see how the service is. One time we commented that our food was late and they gave us a free cheesecake for dessert.. D: ENVIRONMENT: This is a huge place. There are a lot of tables so I don't think I've ever felt that my personal bubble space was violated. I hear this place gets crowded but I usually come here right as they open for lunch or early for dinner crowd.  I like coming here and this is a certainly a place that I'd suggest if I had to eat around the area. Good food. Oh wait. I forgot to comment about the Cheesecake here. YUUUUUUUMMMMM! Rich. Though I probably wouldn't get one right after I eat here since they give so much food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=560,3.76,3.65,3.65,2.768,3.694
91,Erica L.,"Los Angeles, CA",598,245,1506.0,1.0,2012-01-30,"Curse me for succumbing to a free meal, thinking it'd be a good -- nay, decent -- meal.  My boyfriend and I came to the Cheesecake Factory based on the fact that we'd accumulated $100 in gift cards, and thought, ""Might as well use it!""  Neither of us had been to a Cheesecake Factory since our college days, and we were about to get a swift kick in the pants of *why*. WAIT SERVICE: We walked into this cavernous restaurant, and wondered who decorated the interiors.  Utterly garish and gauche, the interiors reeked of McMansion.  We were quickly seated by front of house, and our waiter, after a brief introduction, the general fetching of water, and taking of our order, told us he was going on his 30 minute break.  We had previously joked that there was so much choice in the menu (indeed it reads like a small book), so I innocently asked, ""And what will you be eating on your break?""  Initially jovial and casual in attitude, he quickly replied, ""In and Out,"" followed by a short, stiff bark of a laugh.  Um, OK...  He then introduced his substitute waiter, who's name escapes me, but whose manner turned out to be utterly annoying.  He didn't win any favors when he made a completely unprofessional and racist comment right off the bat.  Then he proceeded to check in on us and our meal TOO often, with a smiling, obsequious, over-compensating manner that just made me want to reach out and slap him (I did not, for fear he'd spit in our food).    When it came down to the ordering of dessert time, he told us to ""take our time,"" and then never returned to take our order.  WTF?  First TOO much checking in, then leaving us in the cold?  Seriously un-smooth.  Our original waiter finally returned and by then, we weren't at all appetized for dessert, having been turned off from the wait service in general, choosing instead to order dessert to-go.   FOOD: We decided, since we weren't famished, we'd order several appetizers, share a salad, and indulge in Cheesecake Factory's dessert.  After all, that's what they're known for, right?  As pescatarians, the choices are slim.  We ordered: Stuffed Mushrooms, Pear and Brie Flatbread, and Warm Crab and Artichoke Dip, plus a Seared Tuna Salad.  Sounds pretty good right?  In reality: completely under-whelming.  The mushrooms were OK, the Flatbread decent, but the Crab and Artichoke Dip was just plain gross.  Have you ever had a cheap, warm tub of seafood-flavored mayonnaise?  Yes, that's what makes this dip so overly-rich, and undigestible.  Note to the Head Chef: there are other food seasonings other than fat. The salad was OK, but surprisingly, wasn't large in portion, so the both of us ended up hungry, and unsatisfied (for $53, that's leaves a lot to be desired).  As for dessert, by the time I got my Oreo cookies 'n cream milkshake and slice of Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake in my hands, my stomach was doing flips from the crab dip.  I felt nauseated, and couldn't wait to get home to nurse my tummy with peppermint tea.   It's not that the food's inedible.  It's just that it's wanna-be good food, and not prepared with much love.  Cheesecake Factory might appear ""successful"" since its a chain, and it's known for its huge portions, however, more does not necessarily mean better.  I now remember why I never returned to this place after my one experience during college, and even though we still have remaining credit on our gift card, after looking through CF's menu and last night's dining experience, there's nothing remotely enticing about this place or its food that I'd return to order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=540,3.64,3.62,3.62,2.404,3.6280000000000006

675,Wasin L.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,73,198.0,2.0,2012-02-22,"Normally I don't waste my time reviewing chain restaurants because you know what you're getting when you come to these sort of places. Generic menus with generic food. I don't even like eating at these sort of places but the other week a couple of friends and I were around the area and didn't know where we could grab a quick bite. We went on our foursquare app and found out this Cheesecake Factory was offering a 20% off $50 discount so why not. Their pastas are decent right? Our dinner took longer than originally planned. It was the weekend so it was packed. We waited 30 minutes before we were seated but that's fine, the hostess told us this when we asked to be put on the waiting list. But seriously, do people not have better places to eat at? I started off with their sour apple martini. I'm a sucker for appletinis. This had to be the worst appletini I've ever had in my life. It tasted decent enough, like their strawberry lemonade. But I ordered a martini. Where was the alcohol in here? I can understand them forgetting the vermouth but where was the vodka to the schnapp? Not to mention it was $12. I normally do not complain about drinks but seriously, a simple cocktail for that much? Especially when it's obviously watered down? And the server had the audacity to ask if I wanted another one. Shakes my head. Moving on to the food. Started off with their avocado eggrolls. That dish is pretty darn good. Much better than their crab cakes. Then we had our entrees. I had the shrimp scampi with their diane steak combination. The shrimp scampi and mashed potatoes were decent enough I suppose. I actually like the scampi without the capellini. However the steak medallions was terrible. What wine sauce do they use to cook it with here? It clashed with the meat terribly. It was like they put an asian oyster sauce in hopes of marinating the beef but it came out as a fail. And the cooks here needs to learn what a medium steak looks like. It seems they have trouble with all types of meat because my friend's meat loaf didn't come out so great too. In summary, we were so dissatisfied we even bother trying one of their cheesecakes for desserts. You can come here if you want. But my experience here this past week reminded me why I wouldn't.

What's not appreciated is that no employees is even considerate enough to offer accommodation for big party (10 & up) seating even when there is enough outdoor seating? Honestly, tables with no customers seating on them are just plain waste. Out of your own employee's convenience, you would rather have your customers wait 1~1.5 hours for the indoor seating.

If all of your food chains are operating under the same system as the one in Arcadia, I would rather go to my preferred restaurant and/or eat at home.

But yesterday, my boss and a few co-workers were invited to have dinner to celebrate Administrative Professionals Day (I didn't know we kinda people had those days! The rest of the calendar year is Step on Your Admins Day). We were greeted fairly well by one of the waitresses and was promptly seated thereafter. Our waiter, Casey or Keith was very nice and patient with our party of 8. He helped each and every one of us as we slowly trickled in. The strawberry lemonade was delicious, I stayed away from the complimentary bread and butter (need to shape up!), but ordered the salad and shrimp creole off of the skinnylicious menu (which by the way, I love!). The salad was a great size because it kept me from eating the entire entree. The entree size was enormous, but I knew if I didn't have that salad before, I would have eaten the whole thing! It was scrumptious! We then ordered cheesecake for ourselves and do I have to say anything else? It was so good (I only had a bite and saved the rest for my brother back at home--he could eat a horse and still weigh 120lbs).

They have like 99 other things on the menu, but I can't seem to give anything else a try. I just LOVE this pasta! It comes with spaghetti in a buttery garlic sauce, lightly breaded shrimp, mushrooms, tomatoes and topped off with a bed of arugula (YUUUUMMMM). But I did order the shrimp pops and they were excellent! My son loves their fish and chips. Taste like H-salt but better!  The bread and butter they place on the table before your meal is addictive so be careful. I really wish they'd bring back the pecan pie cheesecake.

This location is usually pretty crowded, but Sunday brunch was really quiet.  My latte really hit the spot, although it was odd that it was served in a tall glass normally used for iced drinks when I ordered it hot.  I really enjoyed the baja chicken hash--crisp tortillas topped with a hash of potatoes, chicken breast, chorizo, chiles, and corn.  Topped with poached eggs and hollandaise.  It was quite rich, like most of Cheesecake Factory's food.

Ahi Tuna Tartare:  It's a small dish.  But totally excellent.  If you like avocado, raw Ahi Tuna, and Soy-Ginger Sesame Sauce, you'll love this.  I'm not entirely sure what the cracker/chip-like item is that they give to you to eat it with, but it definitely adds excellent texture to the dish. Seared Ahi Tuna Tataki Salad:  This salad is just brilliant.  The person who made it should have a statue erected in his honor.  The mixture of leafy greens and the sauce with a bit of avocado and the thick pieces of seared Tuna together make this a perfect dish.  I won't lie, it's a bit spicy, but hey, doesn't make it any less delicious.  The salad is a bit pricey as well, but I'm not complaining. Ravenswood Zinfandel:  My taste for it is still developing in terms of identifying and being able to pair good wines with food.  However, I can sometimes pair up a pretty good wine with a pretty good dish.  For example, the Ravenswood Zinfandel actually compliments the Tuna quite nicely. Blueberry Mojito:  Mint, Blueberries, Booze.  Enough said (it's really good).  I wasn't expecting miracles or a glass of Amy Winehouse's blood (too much?) or anything, but this stuff came pretty close. In terms of the service, usually whenever I go there, the service is pretty good.  Really the trick to getting decent service in any restaurant is to sit somewhere where your server goes by frequently.  Or just be human to them and they may tend to notice you a bit more.  In some cases, I've gotten a little chatty with my server and they've apologized in advance for not swinging by frequently enough because it was so busy.  Long story short:  Don't go to a restaurant with an attitude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=580,3.12,3.5,3.5,3.636,3.3480000000000008

Unless you consider mastering a dish injecting enough sodium to kill a small donkey. Because that's what the food taste like.  Also it taste like misery.  I say misery because I don't know how else describe a poor sense of taste that would result in answering ""Where do you want to go for your Birthday/Father's day/Mother's Day/Graduation/?"" than by having no answer leading you to choose the cheesecake factor for such festivities.  It shouldn't, but yet it's one of those go to places and all humanity suffers for this.

16,Connie C.,"Orange County, CA",633,392,1135.0,1.0,2012-11-29,"Eleven months ago...the food and the service was excellent. What happened? Management.  First, we were greeted very quickly. We were seated as well and given menus. Then, I wanted to go to the restroom to wash my hands and omg...horrid...the most unsanitary restroom. The stalls...disgusting. I went to the front desk to tell them to clean the restroom and I stood there for a good three minutes. The hostess was too busy communicating with her co-workers that they even noticed and did not say anything. Strike one. Second, I went back to the table and glanced through the menu...took awhile since the menu was soooo long. Then, our waitress decided to come to our table...twenty minutes later. Strike two.  Third, we ordered 3 items...Factory chopped salad, chicken carbonara with meat sauce (lactose, so I didn't have the garlic green pea cream sauce), and miso salmon. The factory chopped salad had onions, mozzarella (supposed to be blue cheese, but I changed it), avocado, romaine lettuce, tomatoes, corn, and chicken. This was refreshing; however, the onions definitely threw off the flavor as well as the vinaigrette (very tangy). The chicken carbonara has bacon (made perfectly), spaghetti, basil, and meat sauce. This didn't taste that great because the olive oil was too overwhelming taking away the flavor of the dish. The meat sauce was salty and wasn't cooked to my liking (stick with Buca or Olive Garden). Lastly, the miso salmon is made with your choice of white or brown rice (brown of course), and had snap peas for decorations. The dish was beautifully displayed. The salmon was cooked to perfection, just melted in my mouth. The snap peas...disappointed because they forgot to peel the top portion which should have been pulled off. The sauce was pretty good though. So one out of three? Kind of a miss for me. The unlimited bread that was given was hard as a rock as well as the butter. So really...I guess this makes it Strike three? Overall, eleven months ago...what was I thinking giving five stars?

I have been to multiple locations and I've always hated it, for various reasons at different times. Sloppy service, shite food, high prices, lame atmosphere. You pick, this place can dish up any or all on any given night.  I was with my beautiful and wonderful girlfriend, and we were near this particular Cheesecake Factory, and I said lets go for it. She (smartly) told me ""No, you know you hate that place."" I insisted. ""Maybe it will be ok"" I thought to myself. Hey, the world just seems like a brighter and better place with her around. And Cheesecake sounded good anyway. I had never actually tried the cheesecake here. It seemed like a good night to do it.  I felt like Macaroni and Cheese, and so did the GF. They don't seem to have that here (the one thing that they DON'T actually have on their godforsaken menu), so I ordered the Five Cheese Pasta (with chicken) and she ordered the Macaroni and Cheeseburger, and we split them. The five cheese pasta was a flavorless mess, and the extra money for the chicken was not worth it. Once again, no surprise, another culinary failure from the Cheesecake Factory.  The Macaroni and Cheeseburger is slightly better, but only just. The beef patty for the burger itself had a strange and none-too-pleasing flavor, but the fried Mac-N-Cheese patty was good. Hey, I guess even Cheesecake Factory can't screw that up. Of course, those patties probably come to them frozen. Not hard to just dip them in a deep frier.  So hey, dinner was a bit of a waste (well, a huge waste), but what about desert? The waiter brings the desert menu around and shows off thier featured cheesecake, a yummy looking oreo cookie concoction. I peruse the menu looking at the various cheescake selections, of wich there are quite a few. Then I notice the price, $6.95 - $7.95 per slice. What? Seriously? I asked the waiter if that was for like 1/4 of a cheesecake, and he said no, but that they are decent slices. I felt like telling him to go eff himself, but it wasn't his fault, he doesn't set the prices, and he was a nice guy who gave us good service, really the only upside to the night. As it was, the bill was $31.43 after tax but before tip, with no drinks, no appetizers, and no fucking overpriced Cheesecake. Just two lame-assed dinner entrees.   So, seriously Cheesecake Factory, fuck you. I'm not kidding. I don't like to be vulgar or crass or rude in my yelp reviews, but I have to do it this time. You guys suck ass, and furthermore, anyone who really likes this place doesn't know a good meal from a hole in the ground. Again, I don't like to get all snobby about my foody-ness, but I'm going to this time. After being thoroughly disappointed by three different Cheesecake Factory locations on four separate occasions over the last six years (that I recall) I will never darken your towers again.

239,Kim B.,"Tustin, CA",1,4,1.0,1.0,2013-02-18,"My family and I went to the Cheesecake Factory last night, there were FIVE of us.  We sat on the patio, Jeff was our server.  The funny thing was we really enjoyed Jeff, he was polite and prompt and got all our food right, which can be an inconsistency there. My family and I are playful with our servers, my brother and I are servers ourselves so we want to make the experience enjoyable for everyone. Well, we thanked Jeff for everything and said we had great service, however, when he brings the bill gratuity was added.  It clearly states it is added for parties of SIX or more. So Jeff and apparently the manager agreed to add gratuity.  This is hugely disappointing, for some reason Jeff and the manager judged my family and thinking we would not tip.  We did not say anything, nor want anything for the disappointment, we just will not go back.  We are great tippers and would have actually tipped a lot more than what was added, but the principle of the matter is he did not deserve it after all.  That shows poor character on JEFF and the restaurant.  Being the industry for a long time I have heard that this Cheesecake Factory Location is the one of the SLOWEST and now I know why, with attitudes like this no one will trust them.

664,Calvin C.,"Arcadia, CA",42,214,34.0,4.0,2013-02-22,"Cheesecake factory! It's the chain everyone really knows about... anyways here are some quick tips: 1. Parking in the mall... plentiful! 2. Monday - Friday, Happy Hours 4-6 PM! Oh god, the $5 appetizers are nuts! I love the calamari and the buffalo blasts. 3. Don't get the nacho's for happy hour, chicken is extra! 4. Lunch specials til 5 PM! 5. Try the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut cheesecake.... oh god. 6. I like the factory burrito, but it's pretty expensive for what you get! The portions are pretty big though! For more read on! I used to go to this place for dinner... but by gosh it's REALLY expensive. I still think though that Happy Hour has some great drink/food deals. They have appetizers for $5 and it also happens to cross over to lunch deals too! But regardless, I have some key dishes that my family swears by when we head to Cheesecake: - The factory burrito -- a fat burrito, topped with cheese and chili verde sauce and filled with white rice, onions, corn, tomatoes, and chicken. Also comes with a side of sour cream and guacamole! I would suggest extra chili verde sauce! - The jambalaya -- My mom loves it, though I'm sure most people will agree they have had better! - Barbecue Ranch Chicken Salad -- This salad is amazing. It's like a southwest chicken salad to begin with, but you add onion strings and barbecue sauce and ranch! It's so good and the portion is huge! Highly recommend for the deal during lunch hours, only $10! - The White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake -- absolutely tremendous cheesecake. SO good. But so expensive........... I remember a few years back when they had a free piece for cheesecake day.... but I digress! There are plenty of nuts in this cheesecake and the white chocolate is sweet, but not too overwhelmingly sweet. Anyways service for my family and my girlfriend have always been good!

93,Summer S.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,681,3.0,1.0,2013-03-27,"Aww, shucks. I come here too often due to its convenience in location. However, today was not as good as usual! What happened? I had a ""Slice of Joy"" gift card that granted one slice of complimentary cheesecake that my best friend gave me for Xmas that was expiring, so I nudged my fiance to come here. In addition, I also had a gift card that I used half of that I wanted to finish. Hey, that was a good enough incentive, right? Well, WRONG. First of all, there was a wait on a Wednesday evening! We actually had to wait for 15 minutes to get a table when there were clearly a few tables open! Holy cow. Second of all, the waitress was very inattentive. She took almost 10 minutes to come acknowledge herself. We kept looking around and I kept wondering who our server was! And when she did take our order, and we asked for lemon with our iced water, she forgot it! She was also not very communicative. Third of all, my Bistro Shrimp Pasta has deteriorated in quality! I haven't had it in a while, because I usually order salad at Cheesecake Factory, but today I felt like pasta and it did not deliver. The sauce was too sour (and lemony), and the whole dish was too high in fat and cholesterol content. It just wasn't a good combo. Fiance's salad was not that good as well. He wasn't that excited to eat it. Fourth of all, I got a stomach ache after my dish! It was not pleasant. What happened, Cheesecake Factory? I hope it steps up their game before our next visit. We usually come here a few times a month but today just wasn't good. Fortunately, though, we did bring home a Banana Creme Cheesecake (per our complimentary gift card), so I did get to indulge a little after my stomach ache and aftermath was situated. The one star is for the Banana Creme Cheesecake. It really was amazing. But that was the only amazingness we got out of this trip, unfortunately.

171,Hanson T.,"Los Angeles, CA",372,204,1558.0,4.0,2013-04-05,"I avoided The Cheesecake Factory for the longest time because I had the misconception that no respectable establishment would or could ever serve good food in a shopping center, and especially not near a food court. Big mistake on my part because this place has stellar service and serves amazing food in bloat-inducing portions.  No idea what it's like at other locations, but the service here is excellent, comparable to what you'd experience at a higher-end restaurant. On both of my visits, my waiters were lightning fast, attentive, helpful, unabashed and simply awesome. Their suggestions made ordering for a first-timer much easier, especially considering the huge selection of items. No blunders were made with our orders, and our servers were so great that I wouldn't have been bothered if there had been.  While there's nothing wrong with the ambiance inside, I prefer their outdoor seating. It was a bit stuffy when I sat inside, but I enjoyed every minute of my outside dining experience.  Even on a chilly night, the patio heater hovering over our table kept us warm and cozy. Definitely consider getting a table outside, if there's one available.  We had to wait a bit before our entrees arrived, but the baskets of complimentary bread kept us occupied. To our shock, our waiter confirmed that the brown bread we kept requesting was actually just their version of wheat bread. Still, it was seriously addictive, and I would have loved to take a couple of loaves home.  I had the Chicken Madeira with mashed potatoes on my first visit, and it was phenomenal. Covered under a layer of melted cheese and glazed with sweet, succulent mushroom Madeira sauce, was a large piece of  sautéed chicken breast. My knife cut cleanly into the chicken and each bite of meat was delightfully moist and tender. On a subsequent visit, I had the Hibachi Steak. Though it didn't taste quite as exquisite as the Chicken Madeira, the steak was well-seasoned and cooked exactly to my preference, and I found it similarly satisfying. On both occasions, my entree was served with a side of mashed potatoes, which had the rich, creamy consistency typical of traditional mashed potatoes, nuanced by a mixture of textural elements, transforming a household side dish into an appetizing pleasure. Neither the steak nor chicken were visually impressive and I could feel the pounds packing on as my meal progressed, but compromising my diet for delicious food was a tradeoff I was prepared to make.  We found most of their desserts to be less enjoyable. The Godiva chocolate sundae was good for the first few bites, but it quickly became a chore to finish. The Oreo cheesecake was equally decadent, with flavors far too rich for a palate accustomed to tasting sweets in moderation. Even when shared between my entire party, the desserts remained unfinished. We avoided a chocolate-based dessert altogether on our second visit, and opted for the mango key lime cheesecake instead. While still a tad too sweet, the cheesecake was good, and something I could actually eat a whole slice of.  The Cheesecake Factory is a reliable chain that features a relatively unchanging, but comprehensive and diverse menu, making it a suitable choice for any occasion and a great destination for groups that have trouble deciding where to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=460,3.24,3.34,3.444,3.12,3.3000000000000007

851,Alvin P.,"Torrance, CA",1,15,,4.0,2013-07-03,"I love this Cheese Cake Factory.  I go here for special occasions.  I guess that's a fairly strong indicator of my classiness, or lack there of but I don't mind.  The truth is I have simple tastes; I like the decor and ambiance here, it's owned by the same company that owns the Grand Lux Cafe so pretty similar in every aspect.   The menu is vast and frankly it can be hard to know what to order so I keep it simple by always ordering the same thing: Miso Salmon.  It's absolutely delicious, you can choose between white and brown rice as a pedestal for the delectable salmon.  Comes with a crown of nice crunchy snow peas and two sauces, a white one and a brown one both of which are pretty awesome. I always order mine as rare as possible. (i'm a sashimi fan) and i've never been disappointed with it.    The brown bread they serve with butter is by far my favorite. soooo good. Sometimes i'm tempted to go there and just eat bread. The cheesecakes they serve are numerous and all very good.  My favorite is the white chocolate raspberry truffle.  oh my gosh!  You cannot go wrong with that. It's a bit expensive but the slices are quite big, I rarely finish mine despite the fact that it's so good.  The best thing about this location is that Christine works here.  What an awesome server!  She always remembers me when i come in and she greets me and my guests even when we're not seated in her section.  She's constantly smiling and pleasant to chat with and she's attentive and expeditious with the order.  She knows i love the bread and she always brings me all brown bread with extra butter.

I opted for soup, the guy didn't mention the soup of the day which was lenti soup. I would never pay for lentils, they're so cheap and easy to make. It had bacon and some spice in it that was horrible. If it wasn't for my friend that offered a slice of his pizza I would not have eaten. I understand that the waiter wanted us to leave soon but that does not justify poor service, I didn't get refills on my water and he said that the kitchen was closed for coffee.

Every single time I have come here, the food is always perfect. Nothing is bland, or too cold. The meat is always flavorful, tender, and juicy. You can't go wrong.  Cheesecakes: I can never come here without having at least one for here, and one to go. My favorites are the banana cheesecake, pumpkin cheesecake (seasonal), cherry cheesecake, and the red velvet. Some of the other ones like the key lime, Snickers, etc. are a bit too sweet for me.  Downside: They have one burrito dish, they don't tell you on the menu, but it comes with white rice which I find odd. I didn't like that at all. Another downside is the wait.

Like many others, I was impressed by their variety but having worked in the restaurant business, I know variety rarely allows for consistency or any specialty at all. I guess the only specialty here is their cheesecake.  My reason for the one star is that I came here for dinner and had chicken sliders that tasted like greasy KFC. I was also told they have no MSG free options and their gluten free menu appeared very limited. After notifying the waitress that I did not enjoy my entree of choice at all, all she said was ""Ohhhh."" In a sad tone. That's all. No apology. No questions. No suggestions for a different item. And as if that didn't outrage me enough, she had the nerve to follow up her shallow 'ohh' with ""well, and room for dessert?"" Really?!...no thanks Cheesecake Factory-you've failed to impress me at all. ....your cheesecake is good-but that's about it.

They told us 30 minutes, but we waited for over an hour. The Assistant Manager and Senior Manager were both aware of our situation and apologized. Chris, the Senior Manager, took our orders for the four kids even before we were seated to ensure they would be served first. We were seated and were almost immediately greeted by Chris and the Chef who had personally brought out the food for the kids - thank goodness! They were very apologetic for the long wait and allowed us to order a few appetizers on them! I thought it was very kind of them to do so. The food was great, Chris kept on checking up on us to see if we were ok and we had a great dinner despite the super long wait.  Then when we got the bill, we found out that not only did they comp the 2 appetizers as he mentioned, he also comped the 4 kids meals!!! We really didn't expect that and would never ask for it! So we went to say thank you and he again apologized for the long wait. We knew it wasn't his fault at all; sometimes bigger groups take longer to leave which is the only reason why we had to wait so long. But both managers really took care of us and definitely made up for it. They really went out of their way to make sure of it and that is very much appreciated.

Their food is USUALLY good and the service is good! I've gotten their factory nachos and the last two times I got it I was a little sad because they use the liquidy cheese instead of just all shredded cheese and it doesn't create the same ooey gooey-ness it used to. They have a HUGE menu and they have some good inexpensive small plates from some delicious fried cheese triangles to a roasted beet salad. Their calamari is also pretty good too...and I rarely ever eat calamari...the breading was delicious and I LOVE their dipping sauce. I usually get a pasta dish when I go there and 95% of time it's always good. The other 5% accounts for the times I've ordered something and it was quite bland. I either the pasta carbonara, five cheese pasta (and add mushrooms), the bistro shrimp pasta (the shrimp is fried so it gets a little greasy), or the crusted chicken romano which is  GIANT plate of panko breaded chicken and pasta. I like to mix in alfredo sauce in the pasta to make a creamy marinara mix and add mushrooms and spinach. It's absolutely delicious. They put so much on there I have enough for two meals. & who can go to The Cheesecake Factory without trying their cheesecake?

Awesome brunch with my best friend.  Only thing I'll take away from this was that my girlfriend didn't much like her pancakes cause it wasn't lemony enough and knowing Sundays are family days, parking will be bad whether you self parked or chose to do valet, it's horrible parking no matter what.

It's not too hard and crispy so it feels great against your palate, unlike the sourdough one they give you. I always end up asking for at least two more baskets of the brown bread.  Whenever I go here, I usually order the same thing, which is the Spicy Chicken Chipote Pasta. If you like creamy sauces with a kick of spiciness, this dish is for you!

A lot of wines but my gf and I aren't wine ppl so maybe this is just distasteful for us. The menu seems a tad bit over priced.

In high school I used to come here for dinner before my formal dances. I am always satisfied with their food and the cheesecakes are bomb. The menu gives you more than enough options to choose from. Service can be slow sometimes especially for dinner since this place is so popular and mainly located around shopping malls. There's a bar inside that serves good mixed drinks and you're welcome to eat at the bar too. When you're seated they used to give a small basket of complimentary bread but now I noticed that you have to ask them for it.  For starters, I love soup so I would ask what the soup of the day is (Small $5 Large $7) and so far I like the Wild Mushroom Soup. I usually order the Factory Combination of Steak Diane (med rare) and Herb Crusted Salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus ($20). The steak is full of flavor with pepper and mushrooms. The salmon tastes fresh and moist. The mashed potatoes are buttery and I love the potato skins in there. I know TCF is not the healthiest as it's packed with thousands of calories! However, they do offer a Skinnylicious menu that offers lower calorie items but haven't gotten around to it since I only go here for my usuals. The bf loves pasta and usually orders the Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo ($17). It's creamy and the chicken is not bland at all. Lastly, how could you not order dessert at Theee Cheesecake factory. I've tried numerous cheesecakes here (about $7 a piece) and I can't remember all of them but the most recent I've had is the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake and The White Chocolate Macadamia Caramel Cheesecake (ain't that a mouth full!).

394,Emily C.,"Culver City, CA",446,252,228.0,3.0,2014-06-10,"I'd recommend coming for the lunch specials or happy hour (Mon - Fri: 4 - 6pm) Parking: On the weekends, the mall is always super packed and it's tough to find parking, especially in the shaded areas. I usually have to circle the lot a good 5-10 minutes before actually finding parking. Service: I usually experience pretty good service at Cheesecake Factory. The staff is always friendly and helpful, although they may not be attentive when you need them. Sometimes, the food isn't cooked to my liking, and they're always willing to remake it (I'm hoping no one has ever spat in my food). Food: My favorite thing to order here is the Ahi Tartare small bites. The tuna is probably not the freshest, but with the avocados and sauce, it really doesn't matter. Next favorite is the avocado eggrolls. The tamarind salsa is so yummy that we always ask for an extra. Also, there is so much avocado inside! Try to catch happy hour so that you can get the avocado eggrolls for $5 (normally $10)! As for the entree, I normally order the Pasta da Vinci. I'm not a fan of mushrooms, but I enjoy the pasta. Sometimes, it's made too salty for me, so it just depends on the day - some days are good while others are not. For lunch, I like to also order the Pizza & Salad combo. I think it's a pretty good deal for the amount of food you get, but the size of the pizza might have gotten smaller. I am not a fan of their other pastas/entrees. Make sure to save room for dessert! You can't go to Cheesecake Factory and not try one of their cheesecakes! Most of the chocolate based cakes are too rich and heavy for me. My favorite cheesecake is Vanilla Bean, Original, and the Tiramisu. The Vanilla Bean is my all-time favorite and is probably the only one I can finish an entire order of without feeling sick.

Because it is attached to the Arcadia Westfield mall, you are more likely to run into jerks like me that bring their kids out to a restaurant on a Friday night.  Crowds tonight or considerable, and the supposed 15 minute wait time came and went like the minuscule bread plate put on our table with three ravenous children at the ready to devour.   We saw one very young couple - maybe 16 or 17 years old - that appeared to be here on the first date.  The extended wait time in the lobby resulted in the casualty of an apparent wall in conversation. I knew he was in trouble when she took out her phone made a call, and started talking as if he wasn't there. Epic fail. As previously stated, the menu has been discussed ad nauseum on other reviews.  Interestingly, this particular cheesecake factory has the added bonus of good people watching, considering that it is so close to Arcadia, the freeway, and to repeat-- it's attached to a mall.

The restaurant is two doors down from Jumpin' & Jammin', where kids have fun climbing around on giant hamster happy trails, and no single father is safe from the onslaught of... Attention.

The food isn't the best, but the quality and taste is consistent, my expectations are always met, and the menu has a variety of safe choices. This particular location has been around since the mall remodeled and added the current food court area (10 years now?). During high school, Cheesecake Factory was the fancy schmancy ""it"" place you'd go to for special occasions, so I've been here more times than I can care to remember. Now, it's a place to go to when no one can decide what to eat. Bar seating and high-top tables are first come, first serve. I don't think I've ever waited for a table at this location, just because I usually come on weekdays (if you're a local, you know to stay away from this hell hole of a mall on weekends). There's also patio seating, which is nice, but there's not much of a view to look at. The service has always been a hit or miss, averaging 3-star quality. For food, I usually stick with a pasta: either Pasta Da Vinci or Tomato Basil. If I'm not in the mood for carbs, I'll get a chicken or fish dish. I'd recommend Crispy Chicken Costoletta or Miso Salmon. Portions are always double what you're actually able to eat, so it's nice to pack up the leftovers for lunch or dinner for the next day. Whatever you end up choosing, I'm sure it will taste fine. Dessert options are endless as well, but I find myself gravitating towards the Original Cheesecake with Strawberries more often than not.

So I waited a long time for a sucky $18 pasta.. Great -_- Also it was bland for my taste ( and I had heard good reviews about this one too). My friend orders the basil shrimp pasta thing (I don't know if that's the right name) but that was pretty good! But my review is just based on my experience this time, it was also my first time at this location. So based on this time, I can't say I'll be going back to this one..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=500,3.12,3.42,3.436,2.9240000000000004,3.3000000000000007
816,Kevin A.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",10,99,,4.0,2014-11-27,My wife and I had a lunch at this CF recently and enjoyed our meal. We were seated right away by a friendly hostess. We ordered off the Skinnylicous Menu which looked ok. The portions were smaller than normal hence the menu name. Chicken salad sandwich was good and also ordered the chopped salad. Both were the right amount of portions. The complimentary bread basket was delish! Never had a bad meal at this location.

A waitress started to lead us to our table, but then, for some reason, she ended up walking away without giving us a table... So I turned to one of the waiters and asked about our seating, and he gave me a mean look and said ""-__- go to the front."" I was a little bit surprised, because usually Cheesecake Factory servers are really friendly, but we all have bad days... So my mom and I, both of us a little bit pissed off, went back to the front to again ask for a seat. We were instantly given a table by another friendly host and our waiter was Cody. Cody was friendly, helpful and attentive. He frequently came back to check up on us.  Good portion sizes, but the food was a little bland. The spaghetti and meatballs tasted like something out of a can, or maybe my taste buds have just been spoiled by Di Pillas (so good!! if you're in the SGV area I highly recommend Di Pillas)  Waiters and waitresses are friendly but it's hard to get their attention sometimes because they're so rushed.

613,Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782.0,4.0,2014-12-23,"This Westfield Arcadia is one of the nicest So Cal shopping malls that I have ever been to, and this Cheesecake Factory (TCF) location is no exception. I've probably been here about four times with several different friends, and I always experienced attentive service and a clean environment. Because I was dining with just one other friend, we usually didn't have to wait for too long to get seated (I think one exception was on a Saturday night for dinner, but that was during prime dinner time). Usually, I can count on being seated promptly (perks of dining in a small party). My great experiences at this Cheesecake Factory ensure my return if I'm ever at this mall or in the area. Though parking can sometimes be a pain (especially on the weekends or during holiday season), dining at this Cheesecake Factory has been mostly pleasant and hassle free.   I think the most memorable experience I had at this Cheesecake Factory location was dining with a friend for a late lunch/early dinner one Sunday afternoon, and the eatery wasn't too crowded. We ate at our leisure and I think we were actually in the restaurant for almost three hours total, just catching up, talking and having a good time. I love when dining experiences are memorable because of the company and because of the relaxing environment (would have been a totally different experience if we were rushed through our meal and the eatery was super crowded, as the Waikiki Cheesecake Factory always is).   Here are some of my favorites when it comes to dining at the famous CF: ""Fish & Chips"": My mom ordered this entrée once for dinner and I had one of her fish pieces. I'm always on the lookout for a good fish & chips meal, so I'm glad I got to try this dish. It features hand-battered fillets that are fried crisp and served with cole slaw, French Fries and tartar sauce. The fish's interior was moist and I did like the battered interior -- crispy, crunchy and buttery, but not overdone. I did like it enough to order it for my entrée in the future, but the fish pieces were pretty small for the hefty price of the meal. If the fish pieces were bigger, it might be more worth it, but that price holds me back and keeps me sticking to my usual burger/sandwich entrees. ""OREO Dream Extreme Cheesecake"": Though I prefer the original version of this cheesecake (and want it to return), I was glad to try this slight rendition. This cheesecake differs from the original OREO one because it includes a layer of moist fudge cake and OREO cookie mousse atop the cheesecake. It's similar to the original in that it has OREO cookies baked into the creamy layer of cheesecake and is topped with a milk chocolate icing. I had mixed feelings about this cheesecake and preferred the original just because I was not a huge fan of the mousse layer (I don't like mousse in general ... nothing against this cheesecake). But, I really liked the layer of moist, fudgy chocolate cake interspersed with the layer of cheesecake (similar to my favorite ""Reese's Peanut Butter"" cheesecake), and the OREO cookie chunks baked into the cheesecake itself is probably my favorite component of the entire dessert. If the mousse layer were eliminated, I would have no problem with this cheesecake being on the menu instead of the original OREO creation. ""Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake"":  I have ordered this cheesecake once, and though it was good, I felt that for this version, the red velvet cake would have tasted better when separated from the cheesecake. This was a combo that actually shouldn't have combined the two delicacies. I did like the red velvet cake, but felt that the cake itself could have been more moist. However, that cream cheese frosting was amazing and gave the drier cake some redemptive quality. I did like the Original Cheesecake as well, but again, it would have been better not to mix the two. At least I did get to try this red velvet fantasy. I still really like red velvet, but would have preferred this cake solo for dessert (or the cheesecake solo ... either or, not both at once). ""Godiva Chocolate Brownie Sundae"": My friend told me that she ordered an ice cream sundae from TCF before because the brownies were superb, so I might have to order one for myself to see what she's talking about. This sundae features a rich Godiva chocolate brownie topped with vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream and toasted almonds. Since the brownie is Godiva, I believe it when my friend said that this was one of the best brownies she's ever tasted. I would get this sundae sans the whipped cream and almonds, but everything else sounds wonderful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=320,3.2,3.41,3.472,2.8640000000000003,3.326

However, if my friends choose to have a meal here, I'll happily oblige. The few times I've dined at this location have been fantastic. The service has been wonderful and the food have been well-prepared.  Skinnylicious Grilled Steak Medallions - Angus beef over a bed of mashed potatoes and surrounded by asparagus, Shiitake mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, in a Madeira wine sauce and sprinkled with crushed croutons. Absolutely delectable. I would definitely order this again.  Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken - Thick pasta with chicken strips drenched in a Parmesan cheese sauce. Heavy stuff, so it's good to share, unless you can finish the entire plate yourself. Factory Combination: Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi - Angus beef coated in a black peppercorn, mushroom, and wine sauce along side 3 large shrimps sauteed with cloves of garlic, tomato, and basil atop some angel hair pasta and separated with a generous portion of mashed potatoes. Gotta love this land and sea pairing. Wild Blueberry White Chocolate Cheesecake - Cheesecake swirled with blueberries and topped with a layer of white chocolate mousse and shavings. The crust had hints of cinnamon. I don't like cream cheese, but this was quite heavenly. The blueberry added that tartness, white chocolate provided the smoothness and cream cheese was pure richness. Factory Peach Bellini - Champagne, peaches, and peach liqueur. It's like a peach slush. I like their complimentary little bread basket. I especially love the squaw bread! This brown bread has a nice crust, soft center, perfect amount of sweetness and topped with rolled oats. I usually like to ask for more, if I'm particular ravenous that day.

We were excited to go, we had few gift cards and my boyfriend wanted a steak and I wanted a salad with their yummy blue cheese dressing.   Since we had the gift cards, we decided to have a couple of drinks, which we don't normally do, since they are about $12 a drink, which is ridiculous to pay, especially in Arcadia.  But I love a good raspberry lemon drop and they make killer ones, so that's what I ordered.  The waiter seemed confused.  A raspberry lemonade?  No, a raspberry lemon drop... I know it's not on the menu, but I've been ordering them at multiple Cheesecake Factories for the last 5-10 years.  You put your raspberry puree at the bottom, then the rest is like a lemon drop.  Well, of course the waiter came back saying they didn't have them.  To me, it's quite ridiculous of a bar to say they don't have something... especially when they have all of the ingredients and you are paying $12 a drink.  I tried to explain I'd been ordering them for years, but I'd pick something else, to give me a minute. The waiter came back shortly saying there was a miscommunication at the bar, they did have them and I'd get one shortly.  The waiter came out with something not in a martini glass that was a raspberry lemonade type drink they had on the menu, which was not the same thing.  It really didn't taste like there was any alcohol in it, and it was so hard to drink, it was insanely sweet.  I should have sent it back, but I felt like I didn't want to be a problem, didn't want spit in my drinks or food, etc.  I drank about half, put a bunch of water and ice in it and gulped down the drink as fast as I could, it was nauseating.   I then ordered a grey goose on the rocks, thinking they couldn't mess that up.  Wrong again... it was definitely not grey goose.  It tasted like lighter fluid.  We were seated outside, which I don't mind due to the heaters, but we had to listen to people honking non stop near the valet while we ate, which everyone outside was complaining about.  Luckily it started at the end of our meal, but it didn't make for a great dining experience.  To top it off, we had left over avocado egg rolls and it really irritates me when they don't pack up the dipping sauce with it.   It's a damn shame when the bread is the best part of the meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=440,3.28,3.27,3.44,2.6280000000000006,3.274

They didn't even pretend to be happy only one person was smiling while singing and they sounded like they were mumbling the words their clap was very weak too. They sucked the happiness from the whole table,It just felt awkward the whole time. I wish my 1st experience  here wasn't this awful maybe they just need better employees ... sigh* I'm never coming here ever again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=640,3.16,3.27,3.408,2.436,3.226

The salad was fresh and plentiful with arugula and radicchio and the dressing with tangy and sweet also with a generous shaving of parmesan cheese.  The chicken piccatta: the chicken steak was pound out thinly and with creamy sauce and spaghetti and a generous shaving of parmesan cheese. The spaghetti was soft and Al dente. Though Mom wasn't a fan of this one since there wasn't even sauce to mix the spaghetti with. I didn't mind this one and it made for a nice lunch to take to work tomorrow.  The avocado eggrolls: soft creamy avocados rolled into an egg roll and I dug it. Mom being the eggrolls making Queen giggle at this American creation, but she actually liked it as well. We both ate 3 each and saved two for me to take to lunch tomorrow. I loved the dipping sauce too - sweet pesto basil sauce, yum!

It's salmon pieces wrapped in spinach and fried in a crispy wrapper with sweet and spicy chili sauce for around $12.  While the presentation looked nice, that was about it. There's only four pieces on the plate about the size of a roll of quarters, and the inside reminds me of how bags of chips now are: 70% air 30% food; not much there. There's also a large piece of cabbage to fill the plate if you like eating it.  Overall, the experience is good and food consistently good.

The chicken was white meat, so it tasted fresher and healthier at the same time. The orange chicken taste itself was sweet and not spicy at all.

Sunday rolls around and we all get there by noon and our name is placed.  The wait was quoted at 1 hour 15 minutes!!  I knew we were gonna wait and that the tip to come early really depends on the day of situation... but wow that was super long! In the end, we waited a whopping 1 hour 45 minutes!!!  We had several young kids and they were not happy (and when they are not happy, they are not sitting still!!).  We asked for bread for them, which the least they could do.  Finally, we get seated and the server was great a little slow but we were a big party.  Food still took an hour to get out to us though!  Must've been slow and lazy Sunday for everyone working bc things were def lagging!  We got an array of foods ranging in the menu from brunch, lunch specials, regular entrees, burgers, and breakfast items.  Nothing really stood out as far as taste and flavor, but maybe we just waited too long for food that we just did not care anymore. I got the Renee's special and the soup du jour was Chicken Artichoke.... there were NO other choices!  So, I was stuck with that...

WTF?  First, we have small kids who can't sit still then we also have elderly ppl who can't stand for 2 friggin hours (We sat at the food court at the mall.... ten steps away and she told us we COULD NOT!!).  Well, instead of getting a cell # to call us when our table was ready, they should have given us a restaurant pager like what everyone else got....

I came with two of my girlfriends for a late lunch and our server Steven knew how much we loved it that he gave us each a loaf and another two each to take home --such great service even if it's complimentary! Since I wasn't too hungry, I ordered the mushroom, avocado, and zucchini fries ($6.95). They were super delicious and did not disappoint at all. I actually couldn't even finish it all, but it's going to become a must order for me to share as an appetizer in the future. My usual order here is the Louisiana chicken pasta ($16.95). It's seriously my favorite pasta and I'm also a huge fan of bowtie pasta. I love the way they cook up their crispy chicken mixed with the sauce.

On 8/31/2015 we went  to the Arcadia Cheesecake Factory for dinner and I ordered the Pit Beef Dip sandwich. I chose the salad over the fries. I asked if I can have iceberg lettuce instead of the typical bitter lettuce they serve. The waitress brought a very small bowl of just iceberg lettuce. No cucumber, no tomato, no croutons, or anything else! To top it off, I noticed the very, very small sandwich on my plate. We're talking Mac Donald's small cheeseburger size with a little bit of meat and onions, and a small 1oz saucer of the dip. I'm not kidding. I've had roast beef sandwiches, but this was a joke. I wish I was joking for paying $14!  I informed the waitress that this was not at all what I was expecting.  She said well our normal greens come with the vegetables you want, but you ordered iceberg sir. Yes, I replied, I asked for a iceberg ""Salad"". Not a small bowl for a turtle to feed off of lettuce only. Wow! The manager delivered the same size bowl of lettuce with the addition of vegetables this time. I informed him right off that I was not trying to be rude, but for $14 this was a very small portion of food. The manager had a smug look on his face acting like this was actually normal. He was NOT apologetic and asked if there was something else I wanted. I said no thank you, and told him that I was giving feedback only. Now I know it's not the manager's fault, and not the waitresses fault regarding the serving of food we get.

It's a bow tie pasta with a delicious sauce and crispy chicken! The chicken pieces are huge too! I usually eat half and save the other half for tomorrow or share with someone.

Daughter and I walked in and we were seated immediately at a small quiet booth.  Okay, I was liking my seat...then we were handed the giant book of a menu and a small 2 pager menu.  The 2 pager menu was the ""skinnylicious"" menu of entrees under 590 calories.  FINALLY.  After consistently having entrees ranked the worst in the country for calories & sodium, you have listened and created healthier options.   Further, I was able to get a glass of a good Russian River Chardonnay. My entree? Seared Tuna Tataki Salad-The Ahi tasted fresh and was prepared correctly.  Plus, I enjoyed the Wasabi vinaigrette and appreciated that they put it on the side so that you can decide how much you want to add to the mixed greens. Finally, our server, Cody L was fantastic.  He was attentive and friendly.  Further, he offered to give my daughter a soda in a to go cup.  KUDOS; my daughter loved this.

The menu is the same so just flip to the Sunday brunch menu right before the dessert page. I felt like pasta so the server recommended the Jambalaya served with shrimp and chicken. I also tried the Factory Huevos Rancheros and the lemon-ricotta pancakes. The Rancheros were delicious especially with the soft flavorful black beans and all the condiments layered on top. The lemon-ricotta pancakes were good since it wasn't too dense or tart. The Jambalaya gave a kick of spiciness so I enjoyed it. It's just really filling with it's large portion. We finished off with a birthday sundae and a pumpkin cheesecake. The sundae was ordinary but I liked it because it was chocolate. The pumpkin cheesecake tasted like a creamy version of a pumpkin pie without the crust. It was just something I had to get for the holiday season.

Some dishes ara more flavorful than others and at the end of the day is about choices and preferences. If you go at night the customer service is the worst or maybe they didn't have enough staff working that night but I literally stood up and went to look for my waitress....but I might go back for the convenience after doing some shopping at the mall.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=180,3.6,3.09,3.324,2.572,3.294
643,Michelle W.,"Alhambra, CA",277,114,426.0,2.0,2015-12-11,"Alright so, for some reason, I keep having a really hard time with this place... Around October, on my friend's birthday, we decided to get food here. The experience was the same, very good! Before we ordered, we mentioned it was our friend's birthday so he would get a song and some special little dessert! The food portion seemed smaller than usually but I could manage! Everything was fine until I found a pea in my meatballs and 'penne' (I switched it from spaghetti to penne cause you can do that!). I brought it up with my friends and then we laughed about it since it was just a small out of nowhere experience. And besides, I like peas in the first place! But what happened next was pretty terrible. I bit into a piece of sharp, flat, charred piece of metal. It cut the gums behind my teeth...  I started bleeding slightly, it wasn't that deep of a cut, but I was panicky. If I had swallowed that, there would have been consequences. We told our waitress about it, and she looked at the food. Afterwards she had to get the manager and he apologized for it and took the food away. He said he wouldn't charge me either, but I still was really hungry. I only got to eat one meatball and some pasta! Afterwards, I think the girl made a mistake on the check because she 'paid' for my bad meal? Like she gave us an extra 18 dollars? We asked but she seemed like she was confused and in a hurry.  My friend never got his birthday song, and I was still pretty hungry. I visited again after a couple of weeks, and was randomly chosen to do a survey on my receipt. I told them about my experience, and they gave me a $10 card, but I guess because it wasn't a good experience, they apologized and offered me a $50 gift card! I like the gestures but I would really appreciate it if they actually talk to their team about this. So on the 10th of December, I ordered a lousiana chicken pasta and a shephard's pie, both lunch size. They told me it would take 15 to 20 minutes, which I gave them before I walked there since I work at the same mall. They made me wait 10+ extra minutes even though my order was right on the side, and I ended up using most of my break time. Plus the walk to and back are around 5 to 8 minutes long each. (I work at the opposite side of the mall and I have short legs since I'm 5'1.). The food by then was damp, clammy, and dripping wet. The man who helped me however, was very nice about it and made the experience a bit better.  Other than that, I feel this place is losing its touch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=240,3.64,3.1,3.32,2.44,3.3160000000000007

The restaurant is within the Santa Anita Mall so the parking lot can be packed on a busy night, but you should be able to find parking, although it might be a longer walk to the restaurant.  Hilariously, half of our group ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta ($16.95), including me! This bow tie pasta dish is served with crispy chicken, mushrooms, peppers, and onions flavored with their Spicy New Orleans sauce.  Don't fret, it's just a hint of spicy, nothing too crazy. I really enjoyed this dish, it was flavorful and tasted great.The portions were also plentiful, most of us had leftovers for to-go.  For dessert, we ordered three cheesecakes: the Original, Fresh Strawberry, and Red Velvet. The Red Velvet Cheesecake was gigantic! I recommend sharing it, I cant imagine how anyone could finish one by themselves! The other two were nicely portioned.

We're at the mall, why wouldn't we take a little walk. Came back early only to be told, we paged you already.

529,Ashley J.,"San Gabriel, CA",159,9,6.0,3.0,2016-01-14,"As we walk in, boo and I could tell that it was a busy night so when we gave the hostess our party number and name she said it would take about half an hour just to be seated.  We were really hungry and were not willing to wait even longer to eat so we decided to sit at the self-seat high tables by the bar (NO WAIT!!). At first, it took a while for any server to notice us. When a young lady finally did, we were given menus and complimentary bread that Cheesecake always provides. First thing I noticed when we were given the bread was that we were given some short (only 2 loaves in the tray)... and it was absolutely cold. I had wondered if the waitress brought us bread from a different party who did not finish theirs? (Kind of upsetting if that actually happened). Boo had to ask for fresh bread from a male server. When the bread came, it was fresh out of the oven and hot! with 3 loaves... Hmm.. We ordered the Cajun Jimbalya and the Chicken Biscuit. Cajun Jimbalya is usually very flavorful and spicy, but this time did not seem to fit all those categories. There were too much noodles and not enough flavor; bland. Had to ask the waitress for more spice and seasoning, but she brings out some sort of ""cajun"" soup that tasted awfully like tomato soup. So I had to ask another waitress that knew exactly what I meant and brought my dish back to the kitchen to be retossed in the Cajun butter. For dessert, boo ordered the Oreo cheesecake that was too sweet for me but he seemed to enjoy it.  Overall, the service was minimal (not sure if it had anything to do with being seated at self-seating tables) and the food was just OK. I would probably only come back for their complimentary honey wheat bread  and possibly an original cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=160,3.68,3.14,3.332,2.54,3.3560000000000008

But I was quite surprised at this location. The staff was very friendly. Our server must have visited us 6 times before we were ready to order (and still we were a little indecisive).  She went over the specials again and we have her a couple of our choices and asked,  ""Which would you pick""  lol.  She gave us a little run down in each choice, ultimately making it our decision and that was great.  She even brought me a small sample of the chicken tortilla soup, add I was in the fence about it. It was really good. And yes, that's what I ended up ordering.  Our drinks were always filled,  plates swept away, and dessert options announced. Mmmmm desserts. Wait! Mmmm CHEESECAKE!  Yes I know we are at the Cheesecake Factory. Yes I know I'm going to want cheesecake. Why why why do I fill up on the free bread?  Oh yea because it's warm and delicious. So, nope... no room for the yummy cheesecake. And averaging the cost of a small meal,  my check book says that was good of me.  I would love to see this place add small small bite size desserts to their meal. That gives people the sweet taste after a meal and makes them want to bring home a slice or whole pie. I just dint get why more places haven't re adopted this way of eating. Courses!  I think that's why I eat at home so often.  I want a small salad or soup and a small meal and a taste of sweet. But not so I can bring home a bunch of leftovers that won't get eaten and not a bill that costs $30 for one person's lunch. I'm just saying.  But overall we really enjoyed this place!

Sitting outside is basically asking to be ignored by the servers and weekends are so hectic you won't even be able to ask for more butter for your bread! Nonetheless, the food is decent, but the lunch specials are what makes it worth coming! There is also a new addition to the menu called ""superfoods"" which is great for vegans and vegetarians like myself! I recommend the falafel salad (extra dressing on the side since kale is a little bitter), french country salad, herb chicken, and da vinci pasta.

356,Jeff T.,"Alhambra, CA",241,388,2015.0,3.0,2016-04-17,"It has its pros and cons.  To start, this location is particularly busy, being part of the Santa Anita Mall.  The wait can get pretty crazy, but they have those buzzer things they give you to let you know when your table is ready.  Restaurant ambience is pretty nice and dim, but not sure if its date night material, considering the sheer volume of people and loudness.  Good for group events though. The bread they start you off with is amazingly addictive; at least the brown bread is.  If you're not careful, this can end up being your entire meal.  This last time I went, I shared the factory combo of the Steak Diane + Salmon (served with mashed potatoes) and a small-dish beet salad w/goat cheese.  I asked for medium-rare for the Steak Diane and it came in more of a rare/med-rare, which I wouldn't normally mind, but it was a bit too chewy and tough.  More of a preference thing, but the mashed potatoes were a bit too chunky for me.  The herb-crusted salmon was fine though.  Lastly, the beet salad was delicious, but we just wished they had a large plate option.  I wasn't a huge fan of the combo meal, but would recommend the Chicken Bellagio w/Pesto Pasta instead.  If you happen to be on a diet or watching what you eat, they do have a ""Skinnylicious"" menu.  Everything outside of this will easily break your calorie budget.  Would recommend if you've just finished shopping and don't have the energy to go elsewhere, but there's also Woodranch next door if you're more of a bbq type.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=120,3.16,3.1,3.168,2.8600000000000003,3.1240000000000006

The last time I was here, we ordered the California Cheesesteak, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and a Tiramisu Cheesecake for dessert - It was very good.  I would say though that the pictures on the website menu section seems like a much larger portion than the one they serve on the table.

She said they predetermine how much drink they put in, so since I didn't want much ice, this is how much it was. I think that's crazy. Asked to speak to manager. Had to ask to different staff members before manager, Kenny, came to my table. Explained my issue, he offered to bring my drink in a smaller glass since I didn't want as much ice. What the hell.

We finally decided on the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Before we got the food however, we waited a very long time. I guess I'm used to it because the wait always takes really long at Cheesecake Factory, but I wish they could do something about it. We devoured the free bread in the meantime.  When we got our food we saw that it had asparagus, red and yellow peppers, honey-glazed chicken on pasta in a parmesan cream sauce.  I don't understand the reviews claiming this was super heavy, but maybe I was craving something heavy that day.

CHICKEN MADEIRA - thin chicken breast with madeira sauce, mushrooms, cheese, asparagus with mashed potatoes. Mmm... i usually split the chicken madeira since CF portion size is generous. for those who say that CF is expensive, they probably don't share an entree. if i order the chicken madeira myself, i would have to box half of it up. if you don't, that is why america is obese.  food comes out in a timely manner. this is one of the biggest reasons i go there, besides the food. when you have such a well-run chain, you get efficiency. also, my fave appetizer are the avocado eggrolls. they are premade. they have cilantro which is highly dislike...but this is still my favorite appetizer. what does that tell you? ha.  i've had the eggroll platter, the one where you get 4 different kinds of eggrolls, but that was overwhelming. would be good to share if you had more people with you. their salads are huge. you can't go wrong with most of the menu.  however, i must say that the most disappointing thing i have ever ordered was the soup. way too salty. i couldn't take more than two spoonfuls. i never get to eating cheesecake but if i were to recommend one, it would be the vanilla bean. i had it at a party...best cheesecake ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=100,3.16,3.22,3.124,3.152,3.1960000000000006

I had been there before and always the waiter or waitress would take it with the bill. I had to ask another person if I could order something and was told that the table I was sitting at was not their area...I found them to be rude and uncaring.  Finally after asking for help someone decided they would take my order.  I think these people have little regard for customer service and think that because I was by myself I did not deserve some help.   Customer service is  not always great.  I have once gone there with a friend and asked that the each of us be given separate checks.  Instead the entire check came out to me.

When we first arrived, the hostess ignored us for a good 5 minutes before someone else came up to us to help us put our name down.

My ""clean"" napkin had green stains on it and my mom's ""clean"" knife had food stuck to it. We told our waitress shortly after we were seated but no one came to wipe our table down until shortly before our food arrived. Even after reminding the waitress about my dirty napkin and the stained knife twice, we didn't receive them until after the third request much after our food arrived.   After we finished our dishes, we were considering ordering a cheesecake to end the meal. However, our waitress just dropped off our check and walked away. That was our sign that our dinner was over before we were ready for it to end. I was shocked that they did not ask if we wanted to see the dessert menu or asked if we wanted anything else considering this restaurant is known for their cheesecakes.

All Butter tastes the same to me.  We ordered off the Skinnylicious menu. My mom got the lemon-garlic shrimp with angel hair pasta which in my opinion looked amazing but for the price is was at, I think the portions were on the smaller side. I guess it makes sense though since every entree on the Skinnylicious menu is supposed to be under 590 calories. I got the chicken pasta from the same menu and mine I think was more worth it. Yes, 590 calories worth of delicious tomato sauce & a little pesto rigatoni with chicken bits. I could only eat half before I got way too full.

I typically come here with family when we have a birthday to celebrate and want to go to somewhere local, semi nice, yet also not too pricey. This is one of those restaurants that reminds me of the high school days, when large groups would go out to eat together before heading to Prom or the Homecoming dances.  My favorite appetizer would have to be the avocado rolls. i normally am not a huge fan of fried foods (especially as appetizers), but it is quite tasty despite being fried on the outside. The sauce complements the avocado very well. Moving on to the main dishes... I highly suggest the miso salmon for the healthy eaters out there. The salmon is cooked perfectly (almost) every time and the sauce is also an A+ with the rice on the bottom (choose brown rice if you want to be extra healthy). But on the days when I'm craving straight up pasta, I like to get the angel hair shrimp, which is just a huge plate of plain old angel hair and shrimp drenched in tomato sauce with a hint of garlic and lemon. The farfalle pasta is also a good option I go to if I'm not in the mood for angel hair.

I think your food and service are awesome and consider every single visit to your restaurant a privilege. My last visit, however, was not my typical positive experience with your restaurant.  We ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad and I asked for no peanuts. There was no follow up question from my server. When we were eating I noticed that the salad had almonds in it, I assumed that if I say no peanuts it's probably safe to not put any kinds of nuts. Anyway I raised my concern and my server was apologetic. She offered me a new salad but we were almost full by that time. The manager then came by and said ""there's no peanuts you're good to go,"" Then I responded it has these nuts, he said they're not nuts they're almonds so you're fine. I said no thanks and he took the food away. Common restaurant courtesy, if you're going to take someone's food away you should not charge them! Needless to say we were charged for the stupid salad.

725,Steve S.,"San Gabriel, CA",312,177,412.0,3.0,2016-09-18,"Ok so this review is going to be honest on our experience as of what we saw, experienced, tasted. I hope there's no character limit as to how much I can write. In all honesty my family and I love Cheesecake Factory but on our visit this latest time we were with friends that just came in to town and I was really disappointed with quite a few things since we love how this place was consistently in the past.  First thing I noticed when we were lead to our table for lunch was the cleanliness of the table and the dishes and silverware. It was like the night crew just used a dirty rag to clean because there was crumbs all over and sticky table. The bread dishes had food stuck on 6 out of 7 dishes, that is bad. I understand 1 or perhaps 2 but 6?! Really was the dish washing machine broken or the dinner crew that slammed the night before that they stacked plates thinking it was clean? The silverware was much better just a few forks were crusted and sticky. I didn't notice what letter grade they received but hopefully not a C.  Now on to the food and drinks which were all very good, with the exception that when a child orders a simple butter Parmesan bow tie pasta you figure it's hard to mess that up, but yep the pasta station messed up in the back, there was a few  green onions that got in and a smudge of marinara sauce that dripped in and got served. Um this would be bad if someone has food allergies with either the ingredients of marinara or green onions, luckily my kid doesn't, but doesn't like either of the accidentally included bonus ingredients. We ended sending it back because what was included was enough to change the flavor of the dish that my child wouldn't eat it. You figure it would be quick to get a fresh one out, um no we were almost all done before it got out to her. Wow that's really amazing.  When we were looking for our waitress the few times we needed help, no where to be found. Waited quite a bit of time. I understand we came at that start of the weekend lunch rush but it's really bad to be not available to your guests, I figure it maybe the decision poor grouping of who takes care of which stations because I didn't see out wait staff really attending anyone else around us. She was pleasant and nice but if she was tasked to help our line table and other tables else where of course I wouldn't assume she's be close to us, she would be all over the place. That is poor management of table groupings for the poor server. The adult drinks were done really well, we had a few between us and our friends and they were all mixed quite solid. The food over all was very good. The other thing I was concerned about was the amount of salt that was used in the French onion soup, wow I used my sandwich to help cut the salt and it balance out better but I just left that ocean in its bowl. I think it was saltier than the Saltons Sea down in imperial county, it was so salty. The salad was good, fresh and tasty. I had the chicken salad sandwich combo with salad and soup.   Over all experience was not what I expected from an older seasoned establishment as this. I hope it was just a one time deal. I will be back again to see if things changed. New edit...9-18-2016 So The mother ship aka corporate reached out and asked me to address my concerns to their corporate site.  will do over and out so I bring back 1 star but I need to send in yet another written letter of addressing my experience? Ok that's a bit much if they can't read my review here and figure something is up. Not being a brat or a complainer but just stating facts of what I experienced and hope the branch fixes it. Last couple times I've been there have been eh just ok not blow my mind wow the experience was awesome. I guess experience goes out the door when you have too many people waiting for a table and you care less. Latest Edit 9-24-2016 Ok guest services addresses me again, glad they are now taking me seriously and taking it internal. After it takes initial and edited post to get it this far wow. People don't think to take it serious after the first review. Uncleanliness is unacceptable period and if it takes 1 review and 1 edit to get it addressed then there is some breakdown in communication. Is my writing too unclear or verbose, I'm not certain but I'll keep it short next time.

The thousand island sauce with the butter toasted buns made this a great burger. The fried macaroni and cheese was good as usual, but they slightly burned the edges.

We ordered our ""go to"" dishes, Angel hair pasta with shrimp, firecracker salmon and goat cheese and beet salad.  Let's start with the appetizers. The firecracker salmon was less salmon than firecracker sauce. Lots of shredded cabbage garnish, but only 3 very tiny salmon rolls. Barely a mouthful. Goat cheese and beet salad was light on all the key ingredients, namely the cheese, the beets, walnuts and heavy on the bitter tasting arugula. Lastly, the shrimp and angel hair pasta was super small and overpowered by what tasted like canned tomatoes. I like the portions, quality and ambience of the Pasadena location much better.

We were seated right before the two people at a table next to us. My husband immediately noticed the table was dirty and proceeded to clean it, before I sat down. After sitting, I noticed my small plate was dirty. My husband gave me his, but that one also had food on it. When the table next to us sat down, immediately the server, Christopher, greeted them and took their drink orders. We still waited for Christopher to come to our table. The table next to us got their drinks and bread, yet my husband and I were still waiting. Finally, Christopher came to our table. We told him about the dirty dishes and he just said ""uh-oh."" Christopher takes our drink orders and then took the meal order for the table next to us. After awhile, he brings water that we didn't ask for. And we wait...the table next to us get their food and we're still waiting for our drinks and bread.  Christopher finally brings the drinks and bread. He left then came back and dropped off plates. Another 10 minutes goes by or so and he takes our order. After another long wait, my husband gets his appetizer. After that, we saw Christopher pass by a couple of times and yell out something like still waiting, without even stopping at our table. After the table next to us are done eating, he immediately took their plates away and joked with them. He then came back and gave them their check. The table left. That was it! I went to the hostess stand to find three employees chatting with each other as I stood there. I called out excuse me loudly and asked for the manager. They quickly dispersed and one went to find the manager.  The manager, Shannon, came out and I told her about my horrible experience and still no food. She quickly apologized and said she would check on the order and comp the entrees. I went back to my table and the table next to us have already left. Shortly after, Christopher comes over and asks if we want more bread and apologized for the wait. Completely fake! He didn't care. Shannon came over and again apologized and offered us a drink and we declined stating that we just wanted our food.  The food finally comes and Christopher haphazardly thanked us for our patience. The food was great. After we paid, Shannon came over again and asked if we wanted dessert to take with us on them and we declined. As we left, no one at the hostess stand said anything to us. The restaurant was pretty empty by then. Earlier, I had noticed the hostesses excitedly wishing leaving patrons a good night and thanking them for coming in.  I know this place has the worse reviews, but I had never been treated so badly there. Christopher not only serviced someone who sat down after us so quickly, but he didn't even care about how he wasted our time. Time is something we will not get back. We don't need food compensated. We have money to pay for what we want. I just don't understand why we were treated like that. And I would hate to think about ethnicity. Christopher is black and so am I. The table next to us were Hispanic. My husband is white. All of this shouldn't matter and hope it didn't matter to Christopher.

The Chicken Bellagio is a great dish to have.  Their BBQ chicken ranch salad is great and the different ingredients add a lot of texture to it.   They do have a happy hour here that is kind of on the down low so if you happen to be here during the week in the afternoon, get some cheaper appetizers in the bar area.

Once we sat down, it took another 5-10min for service.

So, I ended up with leftovers for today and to my surprise...more bones...l pulled out 5bones and then decided I had enough.,I'm sure there were more bones in the salmon cuz I still had a quarter piece left...I'm thinking I'll avoid ordering fish here from now on...this was not the first time that I found multiple bones in my salmon.

In all the times I've been here, there is usually a wait to get seated. My experiences at the Cheesecake Factory have been pretty consistent. Adequate service and the quality of food doesn't deviate (most of the time). On my last visit, I ordered my usual at Cheesecake - the seared ahi tuna tataki salad. Even though I had this so many times already, it still feels weird that the tomatoes come in slices like you'll have on a burger, rather than chopped up in wedges like a normal salad. BF branched out and tried the cajun chicken littles, which were fried boneless chicken breast pieces with mashed potatoes and corn succotash. BF subbed in french fries for mashed potatoes. It was good, though I doubt he'll add it to his rotating repertoire of what he'd usually order. It must have been super busy because we had table bread served on a plate and not the usual basket, even though the two tables next to us had their bread in a basket.

He asked that we give them a second chance and return and a few weeks later we did. He assured me that he had sent the incident to corporate but that the isolated worm incident was a risk with any raw vegetables... except for salad which was triple washed. Personally, I think they should have the same washing standards all around, but that's just me. He said to ask for him, and I did. He said he would come check in us and make sure the experience was better, but I never saw him again after being seated.

516,Sandy Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",566,500,7270.0,3.0,2017-04-10,"Located at the Westfield Santa Anita Mall, this restaurant has been here for as long as I can remember as one the original ""regular"" restaurants chains in the mall. Fixed between Wood Ranch Grill & the newly opened Benihana, the atmosphere of the space is very similar to the majority of the other Cheesecake Factories around with the dimly lit interior space, comfortable (yet rigid) décor and the whiff of cheesecake in the display cases off to the side as you make your way to the hostess booth.  I arrived on a late Thursday evening and was seated promptly with my party (wait time can really range depending since it could be super busy or flowing traffic with no consistency). Our waitress was super attentive and brought everything to our table timely and refilling our waters often. We ordered a side order fries to share & it was quite yummy... their portion offerings are often quite large enough that you can share them among 2-3 people if you eat family style or if you want to share among yourselves. In addition to the double order of fries, we ordered several pasta dishes as well as their meatloaf. You can always count on Cheesecake Factory to present their foods with good taste and I haven't experienced any really bad service from this place yet.  + Spaghetti & Meatballs with penne substitute: pasta was al dente & the 3 meatballs were nice and moist - not dry at all in the center. But be warned, this isn't consistent since it really depends on how long they leave it cooking. + Famous Factory Meatloaf: Comes with a generous heaping of potatoes, 3-4 slices of meatloaf & a side of greens, this dish was pretty satisfying as well. Meat was thoroughly cooked and not dry at all. + Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta (comes with Penne pasta): chicken was delicious and the spicy chipotle creamy sauce hit the spot right on! + Vegetarian twist on the Evelyn's Favorite Pasta: this dish has the makings of all that vegetarians love with a carb twist - fresh broccoli, eggplants, peppers, artichokes, etc. all doused with a light olive dressing. Very flavorful and we added extra parmesan cheese for a nice cheesy flavor twist. We finished our meals and were off on our way, full & satisfied. But again, like I said, very typical of other locations and nothing that really sticks out as out of the norm here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=20,3.24,3.27,3.156,2.732,3.258

We looked everywhere and we were sure that we had it with us 'since we used the hotspot of the phone before lunch' but all of the sudden the phone is not there. We called the waitress, if by chance she picked it up by mistake while picking up the dishes, she said No, she haven't seen it, so we called the manager, she was very helpful, took out the seats and looked for it everywhere with us, but still no phone, I tried to call, but still no answer, no rings, nothing...  The manager told us that she can check the security camera to see what happened, at that moment the waitress who just left us decided to come back telling us that someone have found the phone in the restroom and gave it to the front desk, and she gave us the phone back asking us wether it belongs to us or not. Obviously it was our phone. The only problem is that My cousin haven't gone to the restroom at all or left our booth where we were sitting.

Our server took a couple minutes to come over and she took our drink order while we went over the menu. We put in an order for the avocado egg roll appetizer and they came out about 10 mins after. These egg rolls never disappointment me and I swear they get better every time.  I ordered the chicken piccata off the lunch menu. It came out about 15 mins after our appetizer.

It's one of my favorite dishes the mushroom lemon caper sauce that comes on it is so refreshing and satisfying.

It's pretty big with a lot of seating, but there can still be a wait during busy weekend dinner times. You can definitely grab a drink in the bar area while you wait. If you're into yummy cocktails, I would suggest the Strawberry Creamsicle or the Peach Bellini!  As for food, they have a ton of options ranging from pastas to pizzas to protein dishes. My favorite is the Lemon-Herb Roasted Chicken. I just love the light lemon herb sauce! Also, the mashed potatoes are great because I love mine chunky. The Pasta Da Vinci is also a good choice. It has chicken, mushrooms, and a great wine sauce. They also give you free unlimited bread here that's really great. I love the ""brown bread"" which is a sweet wheat and oat brown bread that tastes like chocolate in my opinion.  And of course, you can't forget about the cheesecake. They have so many different options that it's always hard to choose. The red velvet one is really good, and so is the white chocolate raspberry truffle.

The last time I came here was to celebrate an early father's day. Location/Parking: Located at the Santa Anita Mall. You'll find this restaurant next to Wood Ranch BBQ and Grill. Parking can be a bit troublesome during peak times. Ambiance/Decor: Nice ambiance with modern furnishings and a outdoor patio to people watch. They also have heatlamps just in case it gets chilly willy! Wait time: You might wait for awhile during peak times. So call ahead and make a reservation. Service: Service was fairly consistent. Staffers were friendly and attentive. Food usually takes awhile, because they usually bring all the food all at once. Food: They mostly offer high calorie (1,000+ cal.) dishes. If you're calorie counting, don't get scared off. They do offer a skinnylicious extensive menu for all you healthy peeps. Over the years, I've tried a lot of items, but my top 3 plates that I rotate (creature of habit) through are: 1) Meatloaf: Comes with mashed potatoes, mushroom gravy, grilled onions, and corn succotash. Meatloaf lovers will definitely love this dish. Very moist and very flavorful! Mushroom gravy, grilled onions, and corn succotash is the cherry topper for me.  2) Miso Salmon: Comes with snow peas, rice (white or brown), and topped with a miso sauce. Very yum! I'm a salmon lover and this one is tender and flavorful. The sauce is beautiful! :)  3) Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken: Comes with mashed potatoes, carrots, and watercress.The chicken is flavorful, tender, and beautiful!!! I also like eating the skin! For me, the mashpotatoes, carrots, and watercress balances this plate beautifully.

Because I've never met such a clown, as manger (Amber Knowles). Not only is she rude and inconsiderate but she's a liar. I placed an order three hours in advance for a happy birthday cheesecake with a happy birthday plaque (that I payed extra for) that should have said ""Happy 14th Birthday Meyance"" but when I got home it said ""Happy Bday Neyance"" with a horribly written ""14"" in the corner, honestly, it could of been mistaken for a 19. Who the hell they got writing on the cakes ? Because they need to get fired along with Amber. I repeated my order and the birthday girls name 3 times, you would think they would get it right and the most Amber can say is ""I understand"" like okay? I don't need you to understand I need you to make it right. I told her I was coming back even though I live 30 minutes away and wanted a full refund because I didn't touch that small ass 7-inch cheesecake that was 27 damn dollars. And she told me the most she can do is give me a gift card? I almost lost my damn mind. Like I said I live 30 minutes away, and I never come to Cheesecake Factory... How you gonna take my money, mess my order up and think you're not gonna refund my money? I have my receipt & I will be getting my full refund, because a claim has been made with corporate.

This restaurant chain has a soft spot in my heart ever since my mom started taking me here for my birthday every year. I love the free freshly baked bread- especially the honey wheat. My family and I always shamelessly ask for refills on bread throughout our meal.  Avocado Eggrolls- (5/5) My favorite appetizer! I love the contrast of the crispy exterior with the soft, creamy avocado filling. The tamarind-cashew dipping sauce is absolutely delicious & really elevates the appetizer.  Thai Lettuce Wraps- (4/5) Make-your-own lettuce wraps that can get a bit messy. The appetizer comes with 3 different dipping sauces and an assortment of lettuce wrap components to customize my wrap just to my liking.  Factory Combination: Chicken Madeira & Steak Diane- (5/5) My absolute favorite entree at Cheesecake Factory is chicken madeira. I can never get enough of the madeira sauce. Steak Diane is chunks of steak covered with black peppercorn & covered with a delicious wine sauce. The combination of the chicken and steak was delicious.  Tiramisu- (3/5) not a super strong coffee or liquor flavor & there was a bit too much whipped cream for the dish. I can't hold this dessert against the restaurant, since they are known for their cheesecakes- not their tiramisu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=20,3.4,3.25,3.224,2.516,3.31

My family and I been coming to Cheesecake Factory for years now and I have been getting good services except for this one recent visit we had. On July 2 my family and I went to Santa Anita Mall and after shopping my kids said ""Mom, can we have dinner at Cheesecake Factory?"" So I said sure!. We go there and I told the guy table for 4 please and he asked ""Outside or Inside?"" We all decided we wanted to eat outside and he said ok and gave us the buzzer for us to wait and was told 15 minutes wait. So we waited...waited...waited and after 25 mins of waiting our buzzer started buzzing so we gave it to the guy. He took the buzzer from my husband and was told just stay on the side. We waited again bout 5 minutes and finally the girl said ""Let's go this way"". We followed her and she took us to a table which it wasn't outside like we told the guy but we all decided to just take that table because we were all hungry already. Another 5-7 minutes on the table Kalyn took drinks order then she came back with our drinks but without any straws so I asked her if we could have straws and she said ""I'll be back"". She came back with our straws and left right away. So we were waiting and waiting and waited again and hey guess who showed up after minutes of waiting? Yes, Kalyn decided to show up gave us 3 pcs of bread with 4 pcs of butter and took our orders. After she took our orders my daughter asked her if they have some type of wipes or hand sanitizer and she said ""No but we have napkins. Would you like some?"" My daughter said ""Yes, please"". My daughter waited and waited and waited but she never came back. So by this time my head was already pounding from hunger. 25 minutes pass us sitting from our table another family sat by our table. She brought them 4 pcs of bread which they were only 3 but hey that cool by why we only got 3 pcs of bread which there was 4 of us? Anyway, she took their orders. Everyone happened so fast from the table next to us that their food even came first before us. We waited 40 minutes for our food!. So we ate and we ran out of drinks but she didn't come back to us if we needed anything. After we wait we waited and waited and after 10 minutes she showed up and said ""everything ok?"" And my husband was like can we have more soda? And said for here or to go? We said to go cause it might take another 20 minutes. She came back with the soda to go which was only 3/4 she didn't even fill it up. She asked if we want desserts and I said no we will just buy it at the front and she looked at me and gave me a fake smile. So she gave us the check and we gave her 2 Cheesecake Factory gift cards that was given to my kids both $25 each and the rest I told her to put in my debit card. 5 minutes later she came back and told us that one of the card didn't have money and only one went through so I said just use my debit card for the rest so she left. She handed me the gift card that supposedly didn't have any money that she said she ran twice. My husband and I was thinking why wouldn't have the card any money? Anyway, she came back and gave me the receipt that I needed to sign and left. So we got up and decided to get desserts at the front and at the register where I was paying I asked the girl can you try if this gift card would work and she did. After she ran the card and it actually worked and she even said ""You have $7.35 left"" after she charged me with 2 Cheesecakes. So we were all like hmmmm why  did  Kalyn the waitress said there was no money ??? Well, over all we were disappointed that's the bottom line.

718,Kathy L.,"El Monte, CA",1,53,63.0,3.0,2017-07-21,"This Cheesecake Factory is located at the Santa Anita mall. I came here on Thursday for lunch around 2:30. We did have to wait because it was pretty busy, but it was no more than 10 minutes.  FOOD: I've eaten here a couple times, but this time the food just didn't taste great. I ordered from the lunch specials and got the meatloaf that came with mashed potatoes and corn mixed with vegetables. The meatloaf just didn't cut it for me. I probably enjoyed the corn the most. The portion was very generous though, I expected it to be a lot less than what I was served.  Besides the meatloaf, we ordered two appetizers - tater tots and the fried macaroni. I liked the tater tots, which was filled with bacon, cheese, and green onion. It came with sour cream and sriracha mayo, but I only dipped it with the sriracha mayo since I do not like sour cream. The fried Mac n'cheese wasn't too bad either, I just wished they added a bit more macaroni inside.  SERVICE: service could be better. I don't know if it was because we looked like a bunch of kids or if it's because they put us in a corner, but they could have been more attentive. They probably came to our table only twice besides bringing us our food. We also had to ask our waitress a couple times before we got what we asked for. At the end, she came with the bill and I gave it to her when I was ready, yet when she came back with the receipt, she handed it to my cousin instead. I was kind of taken aback because and confused why she handed it to my cousin instead of me. I'm not trying to make that a big deal because it's not, but was it because I looked to young that you didn't give it to me instead ? Doesn't matter though, but please be more attentive to your customers.  PRICE: I think it is pricey, but its price is comparable to places like BJ's or TGIF.

It loses to Red Lobster but it's still delicious. And very filling so you have to be careful not to eat too much before your actual meal haha.  As for appetizers, I've enjoyed their crab cakes ans fried calamari. The sauce goes super well with the fried calamari.  I pretty much always order a pasta when I come. My favorites are the Four Cheese pasta and the Angel Hair with Shrimp Scampi.

During my high school years was when they opened (10+ years now) I never cared for their food because I never knew what to order. I always stuck with the same food. It wasn't only until recently I started trying out some new dishes like the Chicken Madeira, Pasta DiVinci (along with all the other flavorful pastas they have) , and the most appealing dish to me was their Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo. I've never had gumbo before (I've only heard about on TV shows) so I thought I'd give it a try. And the minute I tasted a few bites I fell in love. Their Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo is extremely flavorful, so full of different spices all mixed together in a thick, soupy texture mixed with rice that gets your mouth watering with every bite you take. I'll definitely be coming back for more of that Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo for sure! However, it is on the little more spicy side, so if u can't handle mild spicy, I suggest u ask the server to make it less to non-spicy.

This is a chain restaurant ,so many of us are familiar with this place. However, the location and staff make all the different. Location: At Santa Anita Mall in the back  by AMC movie theater/Food Court Parking: free or you can get valet in right next to the restaurant Decoration: Modern furniture. It has inside and outside dining area. You also have a bar area for happy hour. You don't need reservation to sit in this area. Outside area also have heat lamp for cold nights Service: Service oriented restaurant. People appear happy and ready to do a great job Food: I got the Fried Macaroni and Cheese. It was melt to your mouth with  crispy cheese ball and you dipped in creamy marinara sauce (delicious). I got the Skinnylicious Chicken Pasta. It was sautéed perfectly with tender chicken and top with fresh basil in Rigatoni pasta Price: $13-20. It is reasonable for the amount of food you can. You can also ask for lunch or dinner portion. If you are into portion control Dessert Menu: Tiramisu,  Chocolate Tower Truffle cake, Fresh Strawberry shortcake and of course any kind of cheesecake you can think of (Ex: Fresh Strawberry, Coffee & Cream Chocolate,  Salted Caramel, Toasted Marshmallow S'Mores , Oreo Dream, Lemon Meringue, Peanut Butter Cup Fudge, Red Velvet, White Chocolate Rasberry Truffle, Dulce De Leche Caramel). I can go on and on about their mouth watering desserts that  will clogged all your arteries. However, you will die happy. They have Sunday Brunch  from 10-2pm If you are into dieting, this is probably not the place for you. Their food are in high calories and it is written write next to the name of the dish.

I usually order my favorite farfalle pasta! It's a bowtie pasta with a garlic creamy sauce, chicken, and mushrooms! I am obsessed with garlic, so I can definitely taste the garlic with my pasta. The chicken with the pasta is also extremely good! It isn't dry and the sauce goes well with it.  The chicken madeira is also a huge win for me! It's a sliced piece of chicken breast, with the madeira sauce! It is soooooo good. The sauce is addicting! It's this wine/mushroom sauce. It went perfect with the chicken and mashed potatoes it came with! Another plate we enjoy ordering, is the avocado egg rolls! My mom loves the sauce it comes with. It's this sweet, cilantro-ish sauce, which is quite flavorful. I just love the avocado rolls by itself! It literally just tastes like you are eating huge chunks of avocados wrapped in a fried blanket of carbs!  I rarely come to cheesecake factory because of the prices. I feel like with the prices of the items on the menu is a little high! There are definitely chain restaurants that are more affordable.

Our server, Mercedes, provided fantastic table service by ensuring that our bread basket was always filled and promptly packaging up the leftovers from our meal. We browsed the cocktail and wine menu, settling on a glass of Chapoutier Rosé wine for me (my first time trying this specific wine and loved the light yet crisp flavor elements) and a Red Sangria for my friend.  Next, we shared the guacamole and chips appetizer (also includes condiment-sized cups of salsa and sour cream), which is priced at $12.50, but overlooking the steep price since the guacamole was THAT GOOD for standard American fare. For our main entrée, we shared the Bistro Shrimp Pasta (pasta portions are ample here, so I suggest sharing if you can't finish a whole plate of pasta by yourself) and an appetizer side salad; a tossed green salad that we asked to have two different dressings with: bleu cheese and ranch. The salad was exceptional for a regular green salad, since the lettuce selection wasn't iceberg lettuce heaped together, but actual green leaf lettuce freshly chopped. The pasta dish was wonderful, however the crispy battered shrimp was great tasting, but not my favorite kind of shrimp since I usually prefer my shrimp pasta dishes to have sautéed shrimp instead of fried. Therefore, if I order this pasta another time, I will choose to swap in sautéed shrimp instead of the former, because that basil-garlic-lemon cream sauce on the pasta was delightful! Although quite pricier compared to other restaurant chains, this Cheesecake Factory location delivers splendid customer service and cooks up consistently delectable pasta dishes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia,3.68,3.15,3.172,2.8320000000000003,3.362

Of course this place is packed but not as bad.  Parking: Parking is ample at this time since everyone is typically leaving for the mall. Parking is pretty easy near JcPenny if you don't mind the walk! :)   Ambiance: Its very loud and lively here. The decor is very grandeur. It's a very casual place nonetheless. Some come dressed. Some come from walking around the mall.  Service: We ordered two waters at 6:25pm. We got our waters at 6:27pm, we also ordered two entrees during this time. We were informed that our complimentary bread was in the oven, which was gratefully appreciated. Our waitress was a very nice young girl that was prompt and nice.  Food: the bread was very nice and toasty and crispy. So perfect for a snack. So appreciated. Our entrees arrived at 6:38pm I got the chicken chipotle pasta while my bf got the four cheese pasta with chicken. The four cheese pasta was ok. The pasta itself, hard. Honestly, I wish they offered freshly grated Parmesan cheese on both of ours. My chipotle pasta had a nice kick, but was over salted and the pasta itself was very dry. The plus side of being at this place are the portion size in comparison to price. I'm getting a two person portion for less than $20. Can't complain.  For dessert, what we mainly came for, was the fresh banana cheesecake. For some reason, our cheesecake was coated with a layer of ice on top. I was so disappointed.

We expected to wait a long time for such a long party but got irritated when we saw multiple parties of 8, who arrived later, get seated before us. When I went to inquire after waiting an hour, the poor attitude from the guy at the host stand was unacceptable. First, insensitively saying we were only there 10 minutes longer then the quoted time - when obviously we had waited for over an hour and not having any reason why at least 3 other later large parties were seated ahead of us. With 3 young kids, waiting an hour is hard enough without dealing with seeing other later parties being seated first and a poor attitude. My husband went to confront the host, who threatened ""I'll take you off this list right now!"" At that point the manager came over to diffuse the situation. We were seated at a table for 8 in the front of the restaurant that stood empty for at at least 15 minutes. I have no problem with waiting but the poor attitude and threat of being taken off the wait list after having been there for an hour was totally inappropriate.

I do enjoy getting their appetizers. I like the chicken sliders, avocado egg rolls which is deep fried, Factory nachos are really good and loaded with everything, macaroni balls are delicious, the side salad is okay and comes in a huge portion, the sweet tamale is very delicious (I don't know where I can this type of fusion) , spinach dip is delicious and not too oily/salty, and the buffalo wings is amazing because it's crunchy. They also have happy hour which is half off on selected appetizers. Entrees of pretty delicious: I have tried the salmon steak which is wonderful and good. It's not too dry.  My favorite is. Pasta Da Vinci. It's a sweet oily taste. Comes with loaded mushrooms, onions and garlic. Penne pasta. I love the hint of wine along with such delicious chicken. I will definitely order this again and again.  My bf had the four cheese pasta and it's definitely cheesy if that's how you I like your pasta. It's really good according to him until his cheese turned cold haha and it also comes with chicken with a spoonful of more cheese in the center.  Love their fresh squeezed orange juice.  Their mojito is delicious and refreshing. I usually get this during the day along with my appetizers. Love the mint leaves  Before I had diabetes (2017), I always get their strawberry cheesecake!!

But after that they served me Carbonara pasta without the sauce and I was like ok I'm done. I'm not gonna keep complaining cause this is just too much. The whole experience sucked and it New Year's Eve. And the funny thing about the restaurant is it wasn't even pack. We only waited 9 minutes.

441,Brian L.,"Orange, CA",243,120,35.0,3.0,2018-01-02,"Came here for dinner on New Year's Eve and the wait was almost an hour. So if you want Cheesecake Factory, especially this location, and don't want a long wait. Avoid the holidays. This location is one of the more bougie and grand than some other ones. The staff is nice and friendly and the food is decent. One of the best things about this place is that serving sizes are fairly large. However, I would stay away from their combination options if you're hungry. My farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic was great and I was able to have some leftovers even after sharing with another person. Definitely try one of their cheesecakes because hello... Cheesecake Factory. Can't go wrong with any choice, but you can always ask your waiter for recommendations. My party actually ended up sharing a tiramisu cake, which wasn't bad but they put a ton of whipped cream so that was meh. Their cocktails/mixed drinks are pretty good as well. Their passion fruit mojito and Georgia peach are great, but will cost you a pretty penny. Their moscato is a great alternative and is more cost effective. My only complaints about this place are that my party had to wait an extra 15 minutes because the hostess at the counter put me down as a party of 2 when I actually had 3. And the waiter we had was here and there and would disappear for some time while his tables needed him.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia,2.72,3.07,3.16,,2.9299999999999997
437,Ivana D.,"Rosemead, CA",284,68,233.0,5.0,2018-01-03,"I actually love this place! Though probably explains why the line at night is so long! Portion sizes are huge as well so you can definitely share or take home left overs!  First to start off with the bread, I love the brown bread that I usually just ask for that one especially when it's freshly warm and the butter gets all melting into it..yuum. Some of my choices to get would be the factory combination of the steak diane(?) and herb crusted salmon. The steak is a little on the sweeter side, it comes with mushrooms and mashed potato in the middle separating it from the creamy sauce for the moist salmon. It comes with some asparagus which goes great with the sauce. I like both side sauces actually but the creamy one for the salmon is addicting! So addicting sometimes, I just get the herb crusted salmon by itself. Another option I absolutely love is the Louisiana chicken pasta! The sauce is creamy, a hint of spicy, with some flavorable veggies like bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms. This comes with bow tie pasta, my favorite pasta. The chicken is breaded and fried, so its a bit crunchy but still moist. Also, you can add as much freshly grated parmesan cheese as you want! The sauce is so good, I like practically clean the plate squeaky clean. I never really tried other cheesecakes but I usually go with their most popular if I'm in the mood. Which is the ultimate red velvet cheesecake. Some days its not so good, other days it's the best thing ever. So I think this is the only thing that isn't always consistent, food wise.  Same goes for service, sometimes the service is amazing, other days, maybe not as good? It's still decent though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia,2.76,3.08,3.176,,2.9520000000000004
440,Henri V.,"Beverly Hills, CA",18,176,319.0,3.0,2018-01-04,"Happened to be in Arcadia earlier today and decided to do a look see through the Westfield's and Cheesecake Factory's menu offers relatively healthy options. Really had to have the larger portion of the grilled salmon, steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes...all yummy good, although I noticed the portions have dramatically decreased from their standard generous portions, was not happy since I ordered the dinner entree and instead received the lunch portion and was charged for the dinner...NOT cool. Unfortunately, that killed my appetite for dessert, and skipped on cheesecake. This particular restaurant in Arcadia was clean and the service from the hostess, waiter and servers were professional, prompt and nice. Watch out for bate and switch, and double check your bill before paying...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia,2.72,3.06,3.176,,2.9240000000000004

The wait to get a booth was very short (only a 5 minute wait). Once we were seated and ordered, our food came quickly. Our waiter (forgot his name) always checked up on us and was very attentive.

They said that they called our party 30 minutes ago! The pagers did not go off and we were just standing in front of the door. So then, they wanted us to wait on the side for another 20 minutes. While waiting on the side, we heard them give another table of 5 who just check in a 10 minute wait. Unbelievable!  Service was slow, and food was mediocre.

438,Alvin S.,"Los Angeles, CA",122,153,133.0,2.0,2018-01-10,"I'm only giving this restaurant one star for service and another for the bread.  Came here on a weekend for dinner with a group of 6 and because they don't take reservations, we wound up waiting in line like everyone else for nearly an hour and a half to be seated. You line up and make your way through hoards of people waiting inside to put your name down and grab one of those buzzers. There's no fancy text messaging system to alert you to return when your name is about to be called. I expected some wait during the weekend but we were finally seated after 90 minutes.  Your experience with service here will vary depending on who you're paired with but our server was cute in an awkward kind of way. He made sure we were well stocked with delicious brown bread and sourdough bread with butter while we waited for our food. And this is where the positives end. Eating at the Cheesecake Factory is not cheap, and while I hate the idea of eating at chain restaurants, my girlfriend really loves the strawberry shortcake here and we decided to bring the family along. At close to 15-20 dollars a dish, you expect to have some decent quality to the food. I'm not sure if the chefs were particularly burnt out this evening but all of our dishes came out terrible and almost inedible. Shrimp Scampi - bland overcooked pasta with a scattering of limp shrimp drenched in butter and lemon juice. If they had kept this al dente, it may have been okay. Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp - overly sweet and rich coconut sauce was overpowering and the hints of ginger made this an entree that looked like a sad attempt at thai fusion curry. Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - overcooked green pasta with no sauce. It tasted like someone had left the pasta boiling in the water 10 minutes too long and washed out the sauce after realizing that it wasn't clinging onto the noodles. Tasted a lot like mealy carbs with cajun seasoning sprinkled on and not much else. Miso Salmon - the one acceptable dish but it came out overly sweet today and my parents didn't care for it. Thai Coconut Lime Chicken - ordered this as it was on their list of new items and I'm a huge fan of thai food. This was more palatable than the overly sweet bang bang chicken but the sauce was way too strong, and again tasted like syrup and coconut milk poured atop coconut flavored rice.  Smokehouse burger - bun was burnt to a crisp and extra smoky. 'nuff said. Those in the kitchen seem to have given up. Quality control between the various Cheescake factories needs work in order to demonstrate to customers that their food is of good value. When you're paying north of 20 dollars per person for food after taxes, it is quite sad when the star dish of the day was the complimentary bread served before the main courses.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia,2.6,3.04,3.192,,2.8640000000000003
510,Ellen M.,"San Marino, CA",0,1,,1.0,2018-01-13,"One star for the bread, and I would give a half star for the guy who grated our Parmesan (yelp won't let me give an extra half star). This is why... My friends and I called this restaurant to make a reservation, but they said they only did walk-ins. Therefore, we walked all the way across the mall to The Cheesecake Factory, and they told us we had to wait for 10-15 minutes to get our table, guaranteeing us that they'd have one ready. We reluctantly left the restaurant and came back when they told us to, in which they told us to wait for ANOTHER 20 minutes for a table. We finally got seated at a table outside that has been open the whole time, although they only let us sit at it 20 minutes after they told us to wait for a second time. The waiter seemed a little sketchy, but we thought it was probably the end of his shift. He asked us for our drinks 10 minutes after we were seated, although he saw us waiting right after we were assigned to our table. We ordered our food right when we ordered our drinks, but it took another half hour for our food to come. During that half hour, my friend asked where our food was. The waiter (David G) replied rudely, ""Probably in the kitchen"" and proceeded with a snarky head nod. After our food arrived, I felt like throwing up in the middle of eating my Pasta Da Vinci, and I never felt that way eating at The Cheesecake Factory before. My friends agreed, as they also started to feel sick, and I'm not surprised if we all get food poisoning the morning after. Additionally, one of my friends got the Fettuccine Alfredo which had the blandest chicken, even though she had to pay an extra $4 for it. We then asked for the check, which took 20 more minutes. Our visit was absolutely abysmal and overall disappointing. Never coming to this restaurant again. In fact, I'd rather eat at the Wood Ranch next door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=20,2.44,3.02,3.18,,2.7880000000000003
