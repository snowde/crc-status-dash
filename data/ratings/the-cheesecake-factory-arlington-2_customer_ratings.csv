131,Jacob K.,"Los Angeles, CA",125,11,89.0,4.0,2012-01-02,"I've been to this place a few times, and for the most part it's pleasing. The waiters are always expressing their interest in catering you, and the food is always good. However, my last visit wasn't the most pleasing. I tried to switch up my regular orders to see if everything was as good as expected. I ordered the Baja Chicken Tacos, and wished I didn't. They fell apart as soon as you picked them up because there was to much sauce. The Ceasar salad was good though, as is everywhere.  Overall, this Cheesecake Factory is good and I would recommend it. Just not the Baja Chicken Tacos!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington-2?start=120,3.3760000000000003,3.3760000000000003,3.3760000000000003,3.3760000000000003,3.376000000000001
188,Natalie C.,"Arlington, TX",0,9,,4.0,2012-01-22,"I was very pleasantly surprised! Never having been to a CF, I was curious and we decided to try it on for size. YUM! The appetizer of Buffalo Blasts were a new spin on an old favorite, and even though they were fried, weren't very greasy, which I was thankful for. I had the Pear & Endive salad, but substituted goat cheese for the blue cheese that it come with, and it was phenomenal! Everything was fresh and crisp, the chicken moist and flavorful, the cheese creamy and light. Hubbs had the Blue Cheese BLT Burger, I stole a bite of it before he inhaled the whole thing, amazing! Meat was quality and cooked to specifications, and sadly we were too full to eat dessert there, so we brought it home. I haven't tried it yet, but the Key Lime Pie cheesecake looks fantastic and I plan on being balls deep into it as soon as I have room in my tummy! Also, had the iced green tea while I was there, it was lovely!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington-2?start=200,3.16,3.16,3.16,3.408,3.1600000000000006
186,Catherine P.,"Mansfield, TX",0,21,5.0,5.0,2012-01-29,"What a delightful experience! I just have to say that after expressing my disappointment concerning a recent visit to my ""home"" Cheesecake Factory in a review here...to my great surprise, the General Manager actually contacted me via YELP and asked me to give his staff another chance. I did. My visit today was wonderful! Exactly what I had grown to expect from this team of professionals! The food was excellent, the service was superb..thank you Jackie, the atmosphere was 5 star and I have removed my previous review. Any establishment can fall short of their goal on any given day, as we must all confess. However, just how many times does the management AND staff take the initiative to correct the situation and stay true to their goal of making sure you, as a customer, are satisfied..let alone impresssed? Let's just say, you will not be dissapointed when you take the time to visit Raymond Day's Cheesecake Factory! If you get a chance, ask for Jackie or Austin...both of these gentlemen take special care to make your dining experience one to remember!

You will blow your ""diet"" but it is always oh so worth it. I have never seen a Cheesecake Factory NOT busy. So if you plan on trying this place out, expect a crowd.

Their Vietnamese tacos are my favorite, even tho being vietnamese myself, i have to say, it's kind of a half n half vietnamese tacos. The inside is real close to what you would get in a vietnamese sandwich (banh mi), but the buns outside is straight up chinese lol. Still, the flavor is sooo good!!! I also love their wheat bread, it has a lil hint of sweetness and maybe something else in it that makes me almost addicted to it :D.  Their jambalaya pasta or watever it's called is really good. You have to give it a try.  I have had the red velvet cheese cake, another cheese cake with kalua coffee, and the black out cake.

196,Jennifer C.,"Arlington, TX",132,36,3.0,4.0,2012-04-16,"Plan on an experience when going to The Cheesecake Factory and be prepared to browse through a book they call a menu. It can be a bit overwhelming and it all sound delish! We went recently for my 12 year old's birthday(her choice). We went on a Thursday evening around 5pm and there wasn't a wait. Although, I've been on the weekend a little later. You can bet you'll be waiting then! On this particular occasion, we were seated right away and greeted by a very personable waitress. She took our drink orders and was prompt. We ordered appetizers of calamari and spinach dip. She also brought us a complimentary baby plate for our 18 month old that included chopped bananas and bread. My husband, 9 year daughter and son enjoyed the calamari, while my 12 and 8 year old daughters shared the spinach dip with me. I really liked that they served sour cream and tomatoes on the side. For entrees we ordered mac and cheese and chicken strips for the 9 and 8 year olds. They were happy enough. My other daughter ordered a Smokehouse BBQ Burger which came with onion rings on it. My husband ordered some kind of burger too. He ate the whole thing before I ever looked up! You can order your meat cooked to preference. They both really enjoyed it. I dined on the Chicken Bellagio which was out of this world. It was two coated pan cooked chicken breasts over basil pasta and parmesan cream sauce topped with prosciutto and arugula salad. This is by far my favorite item I've ever eaten here! I've also enjoyed the lettuce wraps in the past. We then ordered desert.....it's cheesecake, come on! Between all of us we had the Original(my personal favorite), Resse's( peanut butter heaven), Lemon Raspberry Cream, and Wild Blueberry White Chocolate. They were all terrific. I think I prefer the Adam's Peanut Butter over the Reese's. And if you love Red Velvet you'll really love the Ultimate Red Velvet.  It is a bit on the pricey side, especially if you have a large family like us. It ran just shy of $120 before tip. But it's definitely a nice treat! And the service is usually great. On your birthday they bring your cheesecake out on a plate decorated with Happy Birthday and your name spelled out in chocolate. They do sing, too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington-2?start=180,3.6,3.6,3.6,3.504,3.6000000000000005

163,Damon B.,"Arlington, TX",541,287,77.0,3.0,2012-07-30,"My wife wanted to go here for her birthday so we loaded up the Flex with the kids and made the short trip to The Parks.  We went on a Tuesday around 7:30pm and The Factory was not busy. Because the entrees are so large, we decided to pass on an appetizer, until we saw the Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip.  It was OK, as other restaurants, instead of chips, you get toasted bread with it.  Something about eating this type of dip with chips instead of bread.  Anyway it had good flavor and was enough for the four of us to share. For our entrees, my son had The Club, my daughter had the 4 Cheese Pasta, my wife had the Garlic Noodles with Shrimp and I had the Clubhouse Salad, minus the Beets.   All of the meals hit the spot and of course the women had plenty of left overs. We ordered 3 cheesecakes, a Hershey's, a Red Velvet, and a White Chocolate Macadamia Nut. The cheesecakes are not cheap ($8-9 per slice) and The Factory does not put the prices on the menu.  Make sure you ask, as the 3 we ordered cost $26.  And, of course they were great! They only have a few draft beers available.  Overall, good service, good food, and warrants a solid 3 star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington-2?start=160,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.436,3.5600000000000005
157,Rebecca G.,"Brownsboro, TX",5,26,,4.0,2012-08-06,"I found myself torn between 3 or more stars.  The menu is far too big for those like me who are indecisive with yummy choices.  The server was of little help on our questions, and told us that our salads were small.  Since we were hungry we got an appetizer too, only to find out that we could have shared the ginormous salads and still had dessert!  To top it off, the salads lacked flavor except for the few pieces of fruit/nuts/cheese sprinkled throughout.  It was like searching for gold nuggets in a sea of bitter lettuce. Of course, the two highlights far surpassed everything else so much, that I had to opt for 4 stars.  Appetizer:  Firecracker Salmon...I wish this was an entree. Albeit an incredibly fattening one, but needless to say I want more!  Perfectly crisp bites with salmon that is not too overpowering the way salmon can sometimes be.  Skip over the forgettable salads and onto dessert because you can't go to a place named ""The Cheesecake Factory"" without trying it.  We shared a piece of Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake.  Oh, mouthful of joy!  I could have eaten the whole damn thing!!  I think next time I'll skip the meal and leave more room in my belly for appetizers and dessert  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington-2?start=140,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.6,3.5600000000000005

143,Kayla J.,"Arlington, TX",8,46,,4.0,2012-08-30,"""You never ate at The Cheesecake Factory before? How could you have not?"" My friends were shocked when I said I've never been there. Honestly, the only thing I knew about The Cheesecake Factory was what I've seen on The Big Bang Theory.  I was with a group of friends one day and we were all craving different things. When one suggested Cheesecake Factory, everyone agreed in unison, then I was bombarded with questions like the one above when I asked what type of food they serve. Wow, oh wow, I was not prepared for the menu. No wonder it was easy to settle on The Cheesecake Factory when we were all craving different foods. Burgers, pasta and -WTH- even Asian food were listed on an X-amount-of-pages menu. Food was awesome! LOVE the Ahi Tartare. Even got a couple of cheesecakes to bring home (it felt like taboo if you don't buy cheesecake at a restaurant with CHEESECAKE in the name). The cheesecakes were just holy yummylicious melt-in-your-mouth goodness. As for the service, 5+++ stars! Our waitress was very attentive, helpful and friendly. We went on a stormy day, so the power got knocked out a few times. But a manager (I think he was?) went to each table and apologized for the food delay and explained how the power outage caused the food orders to slightly back up. Even after our food arrived, he apologized again and made sure everyone was satisfied. First Cheesecake Factory experience, and it definitely won't be my last! I'm determined to try everything on the menu (which would probably take a few years!)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington-2?start=140,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.536,3.76
162,Mimi T.,"Dallas, TX",73,482,74.0,4.0,2012-09-13,"I'm a fan of this place only because of their chicken madera! Lightly breaded chicken breasts served on a bed of mashed potatoes and asparagus with this delicious brown sauce. YUM! My sister and I came in for lunch one nice day, and sat outside on the patio area. It was pretty nice until the wind caught us and blew on this dirt onto our food.  We ordered several plates to try, but definitely shared a chicken madera. We tried the...  Ahi tuna tartar- served with wonton chips. The dish itself was good, and I didn't need the wonton chips. Samosa- huge disappointing dish in my opinion. I've had samosa at traditional Indian restaurants, and this tasted nothing like it. It really lacked flavor. about 3 or 4 came in one order, I took a bite, and stopped eating. Wish I could have sent this dish back and not get charged for it, BUT I did stay classy, and just paid for it because I did order it after all.  Firecracker salmon rolls are my favorite appetizers here. It's like salmon wrapped in a spring roll, fried (think of salmon egg rolls), and served a tasty sauce.  Dessert: red velvet cheesecake. It was huge, of course. My sister and I were only able to take a couple of bites, and had to box the rest home.  Overall, we had a good lunch out here. Would have been better without the wind. I think we'd opt to sit inside if we come back.

Had the usual 1 hour wait but we walked around and waited for our page. Service was good until they sat a very large party next to our booth (maybe 16 people in a long row of tables). Then the waiter didn't bother coming by for a long time. they served our food and just left. No shaved Parmesan for the pasta, no refills of drinks - just nothing.

I ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta which is great, I order it every time.  This time there was a slight issue with it..i found a strand of hair in my food. I didn't make it a big deal because I thought it was mine so I just tried to pick it up and realized it was stuck in the breading of my chicken. I then knew it could have not have been mine since I just got my plate. Didn't want to make a big scene so I flagged the next server I saw and told him about it he quickly apologized and had them make me a new one. My server came over and apologized and so did the manager on duty and made sure I was tooken care of. Manager offered me a slice of cheesecake on him which was really kind of him. What I did have a problem with was that when my server brought my new plate over she made a joke about how she checked to make sure there was no hair in my food and that her hair was blonde so the hair in my first plate couldn't have been hers. I just kind of felt like she was trying to say it was mine or just kind of being sarcastic about it. She also messed up on our check at the end. She didn't even show us the itemize receipt she just charged our card. Then after she already swiped it I realized she charged me twice for my entrée and she also charged me for the cheesecake that was suppose to be comped. Overall, this place is great.

65,Lauren M.,"Fort Worth, TX",273,219,642.0,3.0,2014-03-12,"Went to dinner here with family and friends for my bro-in-law's 21st birthday.  Very busy on a Thursday night at 6:30pm, but it was spring break. Waitress was quick with taking drink orders and very on top of drink refills.  She even took a group picture of us before we ate. Complimentary bread (white and a brown bread) served room temperature with cold pats of individually wrapped butter.  This is a huge pet peeve of mine....if the bread isn't warm, cold butter doesn't work! Could only take pictures of four entrees, due to the size of our group.  First was this ridiculously large bacon ranch chicken salad, with mixed green  veggies and grilled chicken cubes with BBQ sauce.  The one who ordered this shared some with three other people and still didn't even eat half.  Shame, as the salad comes already dressed, so no way to take it home. I ordered the fish and chips and it came with five, yes five, pieces/slabs of fish.  They were hot and the batter was flaky and very crisp.  The fries were meh, so I only ate a few.  I gave away one piece, at one and 1/2 and took the rest home.  The coleslaw was cold, crunchy with a great flavor.  Big slabs of carrots, seriously 3"" long, mixed it...not sure how you eat those!  Be warned, if somehow you eat the whole thing, it's over 2100 calories! Hubby had the wasabi crusted tuna, cooked rare, and ate most of it.  He ordered brown rice and it's nice they give you a choice. FIL and BIL both got the crispy spicy chicken sandwich and remarked that it had no spice at all, even with buffalo sauce and chipotle mayo.  They both loved this in the past because it was super spicy so both were disappointed. We opted for no dessert as we were having cake later; however, they brought a scoop of ice cream, with whipped cream and a candle, for the birthday boy.  I thought it odd that they didn't serve him a piece of cheesecake since that's their signature item, but given the price point of those ($8-$12) I guess that's why. All in all, very passable food for a huge chain, but I wish there was a way to order smaller versions of this high-calorie, probably really bad for you food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington-2?start=60,3.88,3.88,3.88,2.9560000000000004,3.88

This is great for date night and the food is always good. We decided to sit outside, not a good idea. Because we were the only group outside it took forever to get any service. Felt like our waiter forgot he had a table outside. Took 20 min to get any kind of refill and that long to get the check after asking for it... They give out complimentary bread, different variety. Our favorite is the wheat bread so that's the only kind we ask for. I had the Cajun chicken pasta, my favorite! It's a little spicy and has great flavoring. The pasta was sprinkled with a kind of tortilla chips..definitely makes the dish! My friends had the shrimp pasta and a pepper burger. They all raved about their food. For dessert we shared the snickers cheesecake and caramel cheesecake. Both super delicious and for $8 a piece, sharing is caring. :) Overall, food is always great but service was a little lacking that particular day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington-2?start=120,3.84,3.84,3.84,2.9560000000000004,3.84

I ordered the Pasta Carbonara and was worried when the waitress informed me that spaghetti noodles would be a bit al dente. I didn't want to feel like I was eating uncooked pasta because most people can't get the right texture but I was really happy after I took that first bite. The bacon flavor mixed well with the chicken pieces. I ordered the lunch portion and was very happy with the serving size. At other restaurants that specialize in Italian foods, I have been disappointed when the dinner portion can all be pushed to one side of the plate. You feel kinda ripped off.  When it came time for dessert, I looked at that cheesecake menu and thought.... How in the world am I gonna pick just one! Lol! My 8 yr old ordered the S'mores Chocolate Cheesecake and my oldest ordered the Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake! For those of you that don't mind feeling like you broke every diet you can think of these desserts were well worth it... Lol. Chocolate lovers I'd try the s'mores one. They were both creamy and rich. Although my oldest didn't like the whipped cream, I thought it balanced out the sweetness. Told the girls next time we come just for dessert! The waitress was awesome. She remembered me saying it was my little ones birthday and when it came time for dessert she added a little treat to the cheesecake along with six singing waiters! I was shocked because I didn't even think to sneak away (like you do at most places) to ask them to do that. Just one more reason I had to write this looong review lol!

It was quite busy (we went around dinner time, so it was to be expected), but our wait wasn't that long. We decided to start off with the Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip as our appetizer. The dip came out hot and fresh. It was very creamy and they didn't hold back on the crab, which was a plus. For my main dish I ordered the Fettucini w/ Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoes. To be honest, this is one of my least favorite dishes that I have tried from The Cheesecake Factory. Although my food did come out hot and seemed to be fresh, it was lacking flavor. I started to order the Garlic Pasta, which is a favorite of mine, but I decided to try something different. Needless to say, I won't be order this pasta dish again. For dessert, I ordered the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake. Let me tell you, this is heaven on a plate. The cheesecake was so light and fluffy and creamy and just overall wonderful. It wasn't too banana-y and the whipped cream was a great touch, although it really isn't needed at the end of the day. That cheesecake was the bomb.

I don't think I would bring children to this establishment though. It's more adult friendly.  Now of course you have to order a cheese cake from this establishment.

My most recent visit to Cheesecake Factory was to celebrate my birthday. It was a cold, rainy day (which is strange in Texas in May) so the restaurant was pretty empty. Actually it seemed like there was someone celebrating their birthday at virtually every table. Our waiter was extremely attentive and kept our bread supply at a great level the entire night.  I ordered a chicken club sandwich with avocado and my cousin ordered some variation of surf and turf. Both orders came out hot, fresh, and delicious. Since it was my birthday, I decided to go for the cheesecake. When you go to Cheesecake Factory, you don't just get regular cheesecake. I ordered the red velvet cheesecake, which I couldn't even eat that night because their portions are so huge and I was stuffed.

I would suggest requesting an English Muffin with it to soak up all of the remaining sauce at the end. The Chilaquiles were also very good . I was not a huge fan of the fried tortillas that came with them though, because they were too dense. My kids had the Elvis style Belgian Waffles and those too were very yummy!

For appetizers I recommend their chicken samosas which comes with this mint cucumber sauce which complements the samosas well. I also recommend the avocado egg rolls too! My Mom loves those! For the entrée, I always get the tomato basil pasta with shrimp. SOOOO GOOD! The basil is what makes this dish! The last couple of times however, I noticed it was a bit on the salty side (so you may want to tell them to hold the salt on your order or go easy on the salt). My other favorite entrée is the Crispy Chicken Costoletta which comes with three breaded chicken breasts, mashed potatoes with the skin left in, and plantains. Both dishes are absolutely divine! The service can be hit or miss. On some occasions, I have had great service but other times (like the last time I ate here), my service was slow and the waitress we had was terrible. I figured she was new because she didn't know much about the menu and she didn't really check on my friend and I. Can be pricey. Usually my order consists of two appetizers, a drink and an entrée and for that I end up spending close to $50 not including tip. I wish they took reservations especially on holidays.

Finally, once the food came, I was told that the salad dressing I requested off the menu was one they did not offer. What? Once I showed the server the dressing listed on the menu, she then explained to me how I could just make it myself if they brought me some vinaigrette and lemons. Again, what?  Fast forward. My appetizer finally came out after we finished our entrées. Our server admitted remembering my appetizer order, but not realizing that I wanted it BEFORE (NOT AFTER) my main course. Third time, say it with me now, what?  After ordering cheesecake, the manager was nice enough to comp the appetizer and dessert. Great move.

Usually when a restaurant is this busy its either a sign that it's really good or a sign that the service is really slow. On this particular night, it was the latter. My family loves CF but had never been to this location (and wont be back for that matter). Our waitress Kadesia (sp) was awesome. We ordered the avacado eggrolls as our appetizer. My family loved them as well as their sweet sauce. Definitely better than the ones they serve at BJ's but just not my thing.  Too southwesty for my taste. I stuck with the fresh wheat bread. Its my favorite. My husband and myself both got the cajun jambalaya pasta. After adding a ton of salt it had flavor but I just couldnt get past the very over done and mushy linguine. I had 3/4 of it boxed up for my dog. He doesnt mind mushy noodles. For dessert I ordered the tuxedo cream cheesecake and it was GREAT. These people may not know pasta but they do know cheesecake. My husband was less satisfied with his. He got Chris' outrageous cheesecake (reminded him of a german chocolate cake). It was good but he felt like he missed out on something great by ordering this. I will say though, he did eat the entire thing. We ended the meal with a cafe mocha each. It was good enough. He drank his and mine. Pretty much... it was a disappointment. If not for the great waitress, fresh delicious bread, and the yummy cheesecake I would have given one star. Food service was slow, it was really loud, and if youre charging me $17 for a plate of pasta it better be aldente. If a chain restaurant is what you want just go to Macaroni Grill.

Seating occupancy I noted was 408 people. There was 5 people in my party and we were seated immediately. Our server was very attentive and kept our glasses filled. The menu was VAST.!!  It looked like a mini-book. For our appetizer I decided on Thai Lettuce Wraps. Beautifully presented and they were  delicious, fresh and light. (I forgot to take a picture ). For my entree I ordered the Salmon Genovese. The salmon portion was HUGE.  I noted how there was not a fishy taste to the salmon. I did take a picture so be sure to check that out. It was served over a bed of couscous with a basil almond pesto.  Other entrees within our group were chicken and biscuits and the filet. Everyone was pleased with their meal. And let's not forget desert... Cheesecake of course !!  I had the Dulce de Leche caramel cheesecake (see the picture) and my friend had Banana cream. Mine was delicious.

We ate here on a Tuesday evening and walked right in without waiting. I had to add sour cream, cayenne pepper and salt to the spinach artichoke dip to give it some flavor and to help it from being dry. My wife and daughter shared the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. My other daughter ordered bbq bacon burger and I ordered chicken and shrimp gumbo. Just as dinner was about to arrive, the waitress came to the table and let me know that my gumbo wouldn't have any rice because they ran out. She wanted to know what else I would like with it? I said it's not really gumbo without rice, can I order something else? They obliged... But everything I happen to like from there is gumbo or Chinese (rice dishes). I had them bring out my families dinner so it would be hot, and then ordered Chicken Bellagio (their recommendation). It took about 25 minutes for it to come out. My family was almost done eating when it arrived. The pasta was cooked together (clumpy and under done), sauce was weak and almost non-existent, and it was way under seasoned.  On the upside... The Bellagio was free. The downside, Gordon Ramsey wasn't there to back me up!  I didn't say anything, because I really believe they were trying hard to please. The sad thing is, my wife and I ordered a strawberry shortcake to share and they shorted us on the strawberry's (about 1/2 cup). My daughter got the lemon meringue cheesecake, with the meringue runny and my youngest ordered plain cheesecake with extra, extra, extra whip cream (she received an extra spritz).

I ordered it medium, it came out burnt. By this time, I just didn't even want to complain anymore.

The waiter goes to find a bigger area.... 15 mins later the person still standing and obviously upset ask to use our chair, which he gladly gave up. We receive our food 15 mins later and what do you know two more people have arrived to the birthday party. Now the booth part where my wife is sitting is the only available spot for them to sit. Without asking we now have a guy partially sitting at our table sitting elbow to elbow with my wife while we eating. He's feeling uncomfortable as we are too.. my wife now trapped in between the guy and the wall would obviously need his permission to leave the table looses her appetite and stops eating. By now we have been here over an hour packed in a corner with an overcrowded party group who was promised a bigger table space but now are receiving there food instead. I finally ask to speak with manager and for a carry out for my wife. 15 mins later comes the manager, by this time I'm pissed, I explain ever thing to him as the group of 9 closely listens.  He looks at me like what exactly do you want me to do about it, states that they been working on getting the party a bigger table and walks off....  Clearly leaving me and my complaint as if I should not been complaining.... anyway we payed for the food tip the waiter good as he had nothing to do with the seating arrangements and was getting a hard time out of the birthday crew a left never to revisit this location as long as this manager is working there",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington-2?start=140,3.08,3.41,3.41,2.148,3.278
156,John F.,"Fort Worth, TX",231,5,,1.0,2015-11-20,"I'll start off by saying I love the food here, it is always consistently delicious and Cheesecake Factory has a super well rounded menu. This was still the case when I went here last night, but the service was absolutely terrible with nothing done to try and amend it. My friend and I sat in the bar area so we could enjoy happy hour drinks. We arrived at 5:30 and each ordered a mojito...10 minutes later we still didn't have our drinks so my friend inquired with our waitress who said they should be out shortly. Well 20 minutes later (no exaggeration) we finally had our drinks and our waitress informed us that the ticket hadn't been put in for some reason. We ordered another round of mojitos so that we could get them in time for happy hour, which took at least another 15 minutes to receive them. We also placed our food orders within 10 minutes of first sitting down. About 30+ minutes later another employee (I'm assuming some form of manager) informed us that our waitress had clocked in as a trainee and therefore our orders hadn't even been placed. He offered us an appetizer for while we waited but we declined because they always serve big portions and we didn't want any additional food...I did mention that the same thing happened with our drinks and how service had been frustrating. Overall, it took over 50 minutes from the time we ordered our food until we actually got our meals. Then came the bill, and absolutely nothing was comped. I would have been at least happy had they taken off one of the $5.50 mojitos that we waited an absurd amount of time for, or given us a voucher for future meals. But this was not the case. I could understand if it was just our drink order that was delayed, but our food was delayed too and we were expected to pay full price for admitted incompetence. You would think that continued business of a customer would be would be worth more than the cost of a drink or food. But this experience made me extremely disappointed with the manner in which our dining experience was handled. I hope upper management gets to read this review because it's been a long time since I've been so frustrated over a dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington-2?start=140,2.92,3.38,3.38,2.18,3.196

She literally ran to the table and without saying hello, stated what do you want to drink? I first thought to myself, she is rushed it's okay due to it being packed. However, when we asked for another loaf of bread we were told we have to finish the bread on our table before she will bring another one. I have never heard of such, especially when you are paying for the meal.

Ordered the parmesan crusted eggplants, and the dish had 4 eggplant medallions and pesto angel hair on the side. The medallions weren't as crispy as I would like, and the pasta was way too dry. The flavor of pesto was so-so.  My friends got the fish and chips, with coleslaw and it was done right. But again, very basic taste.  What I did enjoy were the cheesecakes.

Upon seating down our waiter Daniel was a bit rude while taking my drink order. While giving my drink order i was interrupted as he stated that he needed time to write down my request. His level of sarcasm went unwarranted and was a bit tacky  considering that i was patient in telling him what my drink was. While giving my order which was specific to my vegetarian inspired diet, Daniel appeared to be coherent. Later he brought my pasta out which was all wrong and upon my ackowledgement that the order was made incorrectly ; Daniel stated that he hadn't heard what i said as if to insult my integrity and suggest that i by some reason was making the infraction up. I mean tell me who wants to sit at a table full of food  and everyone is eating except yourself. He then asked would i like it to be remade.  When i answered yes he became upset, snatched the plate,  and mentioned  before walking off that it would take awhile. I believe with having a background in customer service, it would be customary to apologize when a customer brings to the attention of a representative of a restaurant, that something is wrong. Daniel lacks basic customer service guidelines that other lesser restaurant chains have cultivated their employees to acquire as a characteristic. He even said sarcastically to our table before bringing my pasta out that my fancy pasta was almost ready. When i asked him if he was being sarcastic, he rudely said that he wasn't.  I brought this to the attention of the manager Tim, whom apologized but really didn't seem to care. Not once did Tim take ownership of the issue and at least offer a viable solution. I was most upset by the fact that Tim's non chalant attitude toward paying customers mimicked the attitude of his subordinate, Daniel. I have been to The CheeseCake factory many times and this was the absolute worst. Then to add injury to insult, we ordered the craigs crazy carrot cheese cake, and our waiter Daniel took 20 minutes to tell us it was frozen. I am very displeased by this situation considering we were celebrating my friends birthday and would suggest others to steer clear of the CheeseCake Factory in Arlington if you prefer ""decent"" and i mean mediocre customer service.

Our waiter, Jason, started out on a pleasant note. He was quick to bring us drinks and to help us place our orders. After our meals arrived you would have thought the building was burning down. Jason stopped by our table to ask how we were doing no less than 8 times. He never offered us another drink. Mid bite with a half plate of food sitting in front of me, he asked if I was done and if we would need to go boxes. We told him over and over again we were doing great and would let him know if we needed anything. He brought our check to the table in a booklet and left it standing up on the table. I laid it down on the table as not to distract from our meal or conversation. A minute later he came back (we were still eating) and said I'll take care of this for you. I told him my card wasn't in the booklet. He told me to leave the check booklet upright until my card was in place. Totally unprofessional. As we were about 3/4 through our meal he came back by and asked if we would need the salt and pepper shakers any longer. Sensing he wanted us to pack it up I asked if his shift was ending. He enthusiastically said yes and he would like to close our tab. We weren't even done with our meal.  He reluctantly turned us over to another waiter. We ordered another round of drinks.

I've never been to a location that was understaffed and tables dirty.  They have an extensive menu. It's probably too large but you have an array of options which can make deciding difficult because the food descriptions are so good.  I usually have a strawberry lemonade which is freshly squeezed and a mojito. They use fresh ingredients.  Love the fresh soft bread they serve. They provide an assortment but I ask for the whole wheat bread. I love how it's warm enough to melt butter. The food is always good. I've had several dishes and each have tasted great.

While waiting for our entries to arrive we munched out on the incredible bread. It works out perfectly since I love he bring bread and my wife loves the sour dough (which I think it is). After a short wait our entrees arrived. My wife said it was one of the best burgers and fries she had eaten in a long time. I am a huge catfish fan so I was looking forward to my succulent catfish platter. I was disappointed since I am normally used to somewhat thinner catfish filets and a lighter ""fry"". The filets that they served were very thick and fried luch darker than I prefer. Also towards the end of one of the filets it was undercooked.

Although they did have some tasty appetizers (calamari, tuna tartare) and some pretty good cheesecakes (tiramisu and choc tuxedo cream), I don't think they hit the nail on the head with their main dishes. Maybe that's because I've tasted what their versions of ""Jambalaya Cajun pasta"" and ""Shrimp Scampi"" were before, and was knocked out in the past. So meh, is about right in my attitude of this establishment. I mean, the ""Cheesecake"" in Cheesecake Factory would hint what they'd specialize in, amirite?  Don't come here for the whole appetizer + main course + dessert trifecta, but after you've already eaten elsewhere and are craving some silky, not-too-sweet cheesecake with that billowing hill of whipped cream. My table's absolute wow-factor flavor had to be the tuxedo one. We nearly inhaled it. Yes, this will surely drag my butt back here in the future (or maybe just for take-out). Our server (dunno her name) was kind of rude, and took half the table's orders and then ran off? Tf? Came back after a good 10 min and then kept ushering us to order more and more and MORE! Like, stuffed that capitalism down our throats, she did. So be weary of this methodology. Use your personal freedom to say: NO THANKS, I will just stick to my choices, thank you. Don't let them make you feel pressured into stacking more plates on your order when you don't want to. Pricey dishes that taste SO MEDIOCRE don't deserve that. Plus, posh and truly upscale places won't have servers who are forceful. Like, she recommended pot-stickers. ""OMG, they're SO GOOD!"" But ya know what? They were terrible imo. Blandy bland bland. Maybe 'cause I'm Asian and know what they should taste like, lol. Anyway, rant over on this issue. Just be warned.

Was told food would be ready in 25 minutes and I arrived in 23 minutes but had to wait for service at pick up.  My Order wasn't ready so I waited 5 minutes and the associate went to the kitchen and came back with the $11 sandwich which he added to the bag where my $20 salmon entree had bees sitting on top of a cooler case in the bakery for more than 10 minutes.  I asked for a refund for the salmon and the associate asked if I would like a fresh entree - will take about 15 minutes if you want to wait. I've already waited almost an hour from when I first called so I said I would prefer the refund. Then had to wait for the manager to come to refund the entree.  I asked him why they would send a $20 entree out of the kitchen when the rest of the order wasn't ready. They don't send food to tables that way. Another woman who picked up take out related that she had a similar experience. She had been waiting for her food for 10 minutes beyond the time it was supposed to be ready and her order had been sitting on top of the cooler case the whole time she was waiting.  Two women appeared to be waiting to be seated but I learned that they walked in and ordered (and paid for) two slices of cheesecake. They had been waiting 45 minutes.  This is such a good example of the type of poor service given to take out customers. I've picked up cold food from there several times which is why I pushed it back to them this time.

36,Dalma P.,"Grand Prairie, TX",0,2,2.0,1.0,2017-07-27,"This was my worst experience to date here at the Arlington establishment. I was in charge of getting my best friend's Cheesecake for her surprise birthday party. I ordered her two favorite flavors, mango key lime and Oreo extreme. I ordered the cake in advance so I could come in and pick it up and be on my way since I live in GP and she lives in Waco.     When I got there to pick it up it turns out they couldn't find my order. They spent about 15 minutes looking for my cake and then 20 minutes looking for my order slip. The restaurant isn't even that big so I'm not sure where she was looking??? When the employee finally found my order slip she said they must've forgotten to make my order since it wasn't in the front or the back.     Then she started grabbing slices from the cakes on display and was suddenly in a rush. Bare in mind, I'm the only customer at the Cheesecake section of the restaurant. No one is waiting behind me so why start rushing now??? As I'm waiting I see her tell a girl to go get a cake box from the back and she reluctantly goes. Clearly both annoyed at the situation. They spent about 35 minutes throwing my order together. When they were done, they rudely showed the cake to me and were overall just being unpleasant towards me. How is it my fault they didn't have my order ready and now I was making them do their job? It was ridiculous, I swear I wanted to leave but I had already paid and had promised my friends to bring the Cheesecake or else I would've asked for a refund immediately.     The cake looked SO BAD. It was clearly just thrown together in a bad way and it didn't even look like a cake, just a bunch of cheesecake slices in a box. Smushed and honestly poorly put together, I was mad at the service of the Cheesecake Factory. Why allow people to order a cake in advance and promise it will be there if it isn't? I don't recommend buying a full Cheesecake, I paid $57 for a very ugly cake.

The waitress brought us the bread basket (I love bread!) however usually it has an assortment of bread whereas this only had one however I was there for cheesecake so I got over it quickly.  The waitress took our orders and suggested that we go ahead and place our Cheesecake order as it was taking about 30 minutes to get the order out. So we placed our order and began waiting.  The drinks came to the table quickly - I got the blood orange margarita which was strong but didn't taste like it had any blood orange in it & he got the old fashion, which he enjoyed.  Shortly after the appetizers came - chicken taquitos were good and the Nashville hot chicken nuggets were okay.  Moving on to what I came for . . . The cheesecake! There was a new cheesecake that just came out that day so I wanted to try it, the ultimate birthday cake. Sadly, it wasn't to my liking (should of stuck to the Oreo). The cake layer was dry, the presentation was sloppy and it was just a let down.

I asked for it to be served dry with no dressing. I simply wanted olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The waitress brought me the olive oil and the balsamic vinaigrette dressing. So I had to repeat my request for the balsamic vinegar, which she did eventually bring. My salad was 90% kale, 10% arugula. According to the menu, it should not have had any kale in it. It had two or three very small pieces of shaved brussels sprouts, and no avocado at all. I did ask for some avocado and she brought me some on a plate.  My son ordered the meatloaf. It had a good flavor but was drowning in the overwhelming sauce. My husband asked for spinach instead of potatoes and he got spinach and potatoes instead of the other vegetable that was supposed to come with his steak.   I asked the waitress what was in the Skinny cocktail cosmopolitan. How was it different than the regular Cosmopolitan Martini? She said there was less ""flavor"" in it. I have never known there to be ""flavor"" in a martini.  So I asked her again? Do you mean the simple syrup? She said yes there is less of that in the regular one. Well, this is in contrast to the last time I asked the bartender here what the difference was and he told me that there was simple syrup in the regular one and Splenda in the skinny one.

I ordered the shrimp summer rolls, off the skinnylicious menu. I am used to the real ones (spring rolls) from Vietnamese restaurants, so these were a little different. I should know better than to order an Asian specialty at an American restaurant! They sounded good and heathy so I got them. The order comes with two summer rolls ($7.95) that are cut in half. I know they cut them for presentation but this makes them harder to eat bc they fall apart. The rice paper was thicker than normal with a strange texture. They tasted pretty good, they were full of flavor and the inside ingredients tasted very fresh. The peanut dipping sauce looked a little strange (there was a white liquid at the top of the peanut sauce) but tasted decent. You also get a spicy dipping sauce, I didn't try this bc it looked oily. Their cheesecake menu is overwhelming! They have an extensive list of wonderful and unique cheesecakes. My favorite so far is the Godiva cheesecake. For dessert we ordered the lemon meringue cheesecake. It was delicious and almost too pretty to eat! It was very refreshing and decadent. The meringue on top was lightly toasted, it almost had a marshmallow fluff consistency/flavor. The cake was thick and rich  with a lemon moose layer in-between the meringue topping.

I was visiting the mall as an artist for a big MAC Cosmetics event being held & I wouldn't recommend it if you're on a time crunch. I had fifty minutes to be in and out and I even asked for my ticket early but I was still there way longer than I had time to be.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington-2,3.2,3.03,3.03,,3.098

She was also attentive and always stopping by at our table to ask if we need anything else. Thank you!! The bread was really good and so as the food! Just one thing I didn't like is how they set up the utensils on the table, literally touching the table. I don't think it is sanitary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington-2,3.2,3.03,3.03,,3.098
