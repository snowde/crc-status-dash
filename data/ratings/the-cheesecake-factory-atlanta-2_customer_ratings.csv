Most restaurants overreach and quality suffers when trying to provide so many choices, but not this Cheesecake Factory. I've had a number of different dishes and all were excellent. The staff has always been attentive and responsive.  And kudos to the management. With so many customers, they run a smooth ship and the one time I had a small gripe, the manager was quick to resolve my problem.

274,Shea B.,"Atlanta, GA",4,37,3.0,4.0,2012-03-18,I will say this one of my favorite restaurants to go to every now and then. I am a creature of habit at times and I just love the Chicken Madeira which I usually order. The menu is like a book with plenty to choose from appetizers to small plates to entree size portions. I have tried quite a few things here and have never been disappointed. They did use to have this seaseme crusted salmon that was oh so delicious but now I think they have it as s pecial every now and then. Too bad because it was definitely better than the Herb Crusted salmon (which is good). They also have good drinks and from what I hear the Cheesecakes are good (I don't like cheesecake).  There are a few restaurants around Atlanta so if one is crowded drive around to the Cumberland location or Buckhead the location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=280,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.056,3.76

The food was ok but we were not happy with the way we were treated. I emailed the corporate headquarters and they in turn sent my email to the restaurant manager. He and I spoke about the incident and he was very apologetic, and offered to mail us a gift certificate so that we could come back for a better experience and told me he was going to follow up on the matter.

Never!) the service is remarkably subpar. Not only is it usually slow, but I've had a few waiters be downright inattentive to the point of rude. I have a suspicion it is because I'm usually with my younger siblings (high school/early college aged) and they assume that because we're all relatively young that we don't tip well. On the contrary, my standard tip is 20%, with percentage deducted only for bad service, and all my dining companions tip the same way. We're never rowdy or rude, so I am really shocked to see that this behavior by the waiters is a pattern and not a fluke. This is the only Cheesecake Factory location I've ever had a problem like this at.

144,Angela S.,"Smyrna, GA",362,568,2414.0,3.0,2012-09-07,"(Note: Since it's been a very long time since I'd last dined inside this particular Cheesecake Factory, this review is specifically for the take out section.) After enjoying our lunch at Maggiano's Little Italy on a Sunday afternoon, my sister wanted dessert, but not just any kind.  My sister was craving GOOD cheesecake, and she wanted to treat me, too!  =)  Since it was blazing hot that day, I drove the (incredibly) short distance from Maggiano's to park closer to this Cheesecake Factory. We walked straight to the take out counter, which is on the right as soon as you enter the restaurant.  There was one customer in front of us, and since my sister and I pretty much knew what we wanted, we had made our decisions on which cheesecakes we wanted by the time the customer was done ordering. To make a long story short, the employee taking orders at the cash register was busy taking orders over the phone and preparing take out meals.  We stood and waited at least five minutes before she finally took our cheesecake orders, and we specifically requested whipped cream to be included on the side (since I wasn't sure whether they always provided whipped cream).  After ordering and paying, we waited another ten minutes or so for our cheesecakes.  The employee was not friendly or apologetic about the delay. When we finally got our cheesecakes, we looked at both to ensure we got the right ones and that they had whipped cream.  Neither included whipped cream, and one order was incorrect.  My sister had ordered the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake, but she got the Oreo one instead.  WOW.  So we requested the whipped cream again, which they put in plastic containers.  And, of course, my sister notified them of the mistake they made. If you've never ordered the Red Velvet cheesecake, you should know that it is a HUGE slice, so it's put in a plastic container that is larger than the standard cheesecake slice container.  The container is large enough to fit a huge salad.  However, instead of putting the large container in a plastic bag for her to carry, the employee simply handed it over to her.  Per my suggestion to request a bag, my sister got one because it would have been awkward to carry the large container, and of course there's a higher risk of dropping it on the way to my car without a bag.   Once we got home, we didn't eat our cheesecakes right away since they were no longer cold.  We put them in the fridge for a few hours and let them chill so that we could enjoy them later. * Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake ($6.95) - Per the menu description, this is a ""Silky Chocolate Cheesecake Topped with a Layer of Belgian Chocolate Mousse.""  Although I'm normally not a dessert person, I am a huge fan of chocolate mousse.  This cheesecake was as delicious as it sounds.  I just love the smooth texture of mousse, and it isn't overly rich like regular chocolate frosting.  You must put a bit of whipped cream on each bite!  Yuuuum...  =) * Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake ($7.95) - ""Moist layers of Red Velvet Cake and our Original Cheesecake covered with our special Cheesecake Factory cream cheese frosting.""  It's HEAVENLY.  There isn't much else to say, but I really like that there isn't an overly cheesy/milky aftertaste as some red velvet cakes have.  I definitely want to get this one next time! Overall, The Cheesecake Factory (take out section ONLY) at Perimeter Mall gets 3.5 stars because the cheesecake is amazing, but service wasn't.  The cheesecake itself easily deserves 5 stars.  So good!  I know this will sound crazy, but their Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake is the best red velvet that I have ever tasted!  I can't believe I had never tried it until recently.  I highly recommend you try it if you haven't already!

257,Jessica D.,"Atlanta, GA",322,445,227.0,3.0,2013-01-30,"Came here again last night for a birthday dinner. Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations, so it was a bit difficult to be seated since half the party showed up almost an hour late (better late than never, though!). We were among the first to arrive and went ahead and gave them a head count of 15-20. It actually wasn't too long until the tables were ready, but in order to be seated, we had to have at least 8 people present. At the time, we didn't, so we made the executive decision to give up our table and wait until they could get enough seating again later. It was a shame, because they actually held our table for about 40 minutes. If only people would just show up on time. The staff was extremely understanding, accommodating and kept us informed throughout the duration of our wait. 5-star service right there, folks. Fast forward an hour later, and a few moments after the final guests arrived, our new seating arrangement was ready for us. Here's the rundown: Service: Our two waiters were friendly and came by often enough for refills on everything but water, for some reason. Overall, not bad. Drinks: Frozen drinks were good; I'd recommend the Georgia Peach. Mixed drinks ($10) were okay but they were mostly ice and not enough of the drink itself. Just request for a little bit of ice and you'll be good to go. One buddy of mine ordered his usual Crown on the rocks ($12) and received some sort of mixed Crown concoction. The color was VERY off and it tasted extremely light. Skip on getting anything on the rocks, because they seem to cheat you of your spirits. Food: For the bigger foodies, we thought the dishes were very.. mediocre / subpar. For those who don't get out nearly as often, they thought it was great! Food portions were giant (that's their signature thing) except for the ""combination"" plates. So, keep that in mind when you order.. whether you have a big appetite or not. I got their crowd pleasing Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (according to the menu) but I found it to be very bland and the shrimp was overcooked and tough. If you come here, I'd suggest sticking to ordering small plates / appetizers and desserts only. I can't remember a time when I thought any entree was bomb[dot]com. For small plates / appetizers, I recommend: 1. Vietnamese Tacos. It's not authentic, and it's pretty much a glorified, Americanized version of a banh mi. It was interesting, but pretty darn delicious nonetheless. 2. Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip. You can never go wrong with any sort of cheese dip to start off your dinner! 3. Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes. D and I got these on a whim when we were here before and it's probably my most favorite thing off their entire menu! However, much to my disappointment, it wasn't there or I overlooked it, in search of it ten times over. For desserts, I recommend: 1. Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake. There are layers of red velvet cake and cheesecake, combined to create this piece of heaven. It was sweet, but not overly sweet. Simply put: it was perfect! 2. OREO Dream Extreme Cheesecake. This one is new, and an amped up version of their OREO cheesecake they offered before. 3. Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel. I thought getting something with fruit in it would make me feel less guilty about ordering a dessert. Nope! This one is actually the sweetest tasting of the three I suggested. Surprising, huh? There is no free dessert for birthdays (darn!) but they do write a pretty message on your plate and come by to sing happy birthday. There were a LOT of birthdays celebrated yesterday. We heard the staff sing 3-4 times before it was finally our turn. Parking is ample, as Cheesecake Factory is attached to the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=220,3.64,3.64,3.64,2.9560000000000004,3.6400000000000006

It tends be very busy during the weekends. I have been here for lunch several times during the weekday and it's not as noisy, which is relaxing when you can actually hear the music.  I have been here numerous amount of times over the year. I remember celebrating a birthday dinner here about 4-5 years ago and at the time, they accommodated my large party with reservations prior to the event. I don't think they do it anymore based on some recent reviews I've read.  FOOD/DESSERT: Pretty good food and portion for the price. I love their calamari and tex-mex egg rolls appetizer. For entrees, they have an extensive menu ranging from items such as pasta to burgers to salads. They also have a SKINNYLICIOUS menu for folks watching their calories. That's always a cool thing.  Cheesecake is pretty good as well as their cakes.

Overall, they do do well at not serving super authentic food that manages to still taste really good. The portions are huge, and good for sharing family style. The bread that is served with the food is DELICIOUS, fresh and warm. I go for the dark bread only. Their mojitos are well made, some with Trinidadian 10 Cane Rum (MY FAVE), and are well mixed. Not strong drinks though they have strong drink club prices. The cheesecake or dessert will run you anothe $6 to $10 so it's NOT a cheap date-- and at over 1000 calories a slice, it's not waistline friendly, either. Eater beware and budgets beware.

307,Ariana M.,"Sandy Springs, GA",1,8,,1.0,2014-01-05,"Updated review: I wrote a review for this restaurant before but recently I have went in and was completely disappointed! The server was rushing me to order because I was the only one at the table who didn't know what to order so she attempted to help me out quickly and ended up recommending a pasta with bacon in it without letting me know that it has bacon in it. I do not eat pork and I violate my religion! When I asked the server if it had pork it in she did not know, which shows that they do not know about the food they are selling, not do they care if the customer will enjoy the meal. When I told her I couldn't eat pork she grabbed the plate the plate from me and said ""what do I do? Do I move it away from you?"" In a sarcastic tone as if there was something funny about this situation. I refused to pay for the meal and was told that I ate all of it and that can't be done. I'm sure that even people who do not like their meals at other restaurants the waiters and managers are pleased to satisfy them without even a question and offer them another meal. The manager at this Cheesecake Factory took this situation very lightly as if it was unimportant to me or him! He was very careless about my religion and not very sympathetic! This is was truly pissed me off, I know people make mistakes and when they are not able to own up to those mistakes and act careless as these people who would ever want to come back here? As I was waiting for my friends I overheard other workers who had no part in this situation speaking about me, laughing and mocking me to their coworkers. After hearing this, I asked the guy who was speaking of the situation for his name which he would not disclose, and neither would the manager! He just stood there as if he was not a manager and as if there was nothing wrong with that .This situation was not everyone's business and I will be going to corporate about this, if not any further!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=300,3.32,3.53,3.53,2.8520000000000003,3.446

I always remember Cheesecake Factory as HUGE portions for the price you pay. I prefer getting the classics, and you can't go wrong with the Shepherd's Pie or the Meatloaf. Any of the pastas aren't bad as well. Everything here is quite heavy, and the cheesecakes are intimidating but the best (and unhealthiest) dessert ever. RED VELVET CHEESECAKE ftw. They offer a Skinny menu for healthier eating... but when you're at the Cheesecake Factory, why bother, just go all the way :)  Service is usually pretty good here. Although it's quite busy, I've never had to wait more than 10-20 minutes for a table, whatever the size of our group is (I've never been during a peak hour before though so that may be an inaccurate estimate). The servers are usually nice and friendly. One of my friends dropped his flatbread seconds after the server delivered it to our table. Although I'm sure both parties were at fault (the server set it down dangerously close to the edge, and my slightly buzzed friend brushed past the platter when standing up to go the bathroom, they quickly moved to replace it free of charge, as it should be.

Absolutely delectable layers of vanilla cake and lemon mascarpone cream are topped with streusel and served with strawberries, syrup, and whipped cream, and I think I tasted lady fingers as well. The cake is so moist and soaks up the strawberry syrup, strawberry juice, and lemon mascarpone. You can see the photo I posted. The mixture of the strawberry and lemon made it taste like passion fruit. I am not a fan of their cheesecake; I find it too soft and lacking in taste, and it just doesn't have the right texture - I am quite smug about the cheesecake I bake (my secret recipe), although ordering cheesecake is fun here because of all the choices. The rest of the menu is just okay; this is a chain. I was recently in Austria and Germany and was terribly disappointed by the desserts there, even in Vienna's famous cafes.

83,Thomas L.,"Norcross, GA",26,87,4.0,3.0,2014-03-06,"I don't normally enjoy writing reviews about corporate, chain restaurants. Firstly, I believe their atmosphere and theme to be silly and derivative, and secondly, I'd rather spend my money on an establishment where the money flows more directly into the community. With that said, I recently visited the Cheesecake Factory at the Perimeter Mall and it warrants a review, for reasons both good and not so good.  To begin with, the interior of the restaurant looks like something one would find at Disneyworld - this is to say somewhat cute, an obvious attempt to come across as attractive. I don't even know where to begin to describe the décor or this place - it had fake columns reminiscent of the Classical world,  carved faces in the fashion of the Aztecs and Mayans, and painted ceilings resembling poor man's imitation of Michelangelo. Weird, but not outright unattractive.  The Cheesecake Factory is always busy and doesn't take reservations on weekend nights during peak  hours. This means you will wait for 15 - 30 minutes to be seated. That's not so bad, but even though the restaurant is quite large, it's also cramped and loud making conservation quite difficult. The service is definitely friendly. I was asked, ""How are you tonight, sir?"" multiple times (which I presume to be a dictat from on high to the staff) but it's not very snappy, either. This is to be expected and forgiven in such a busy establishment, though. That said, it's not somewhere I'd recommend you go out for a date night or an intimate and relaxing dinner.  The menu is very extensive, almost overwhelming. Personally, I prefer a restaurant that trims downs it menu and focuses on doing several things very well, but the Cheesecake Factory takes the opposite, broader approach.  Now, to the most important part - the food. It's nothing to write home about but I certainly didn't leave hungry, either. I had the fried macaroni balls for the appetizer - rich and filling, and chicken pot stickers for dinner. I've certainly had better pot stickers, but they were quite good, served with a slightly crispy shell, chicken and seasoned with ginger soy sauce. I cleaned my plate and have no real complaint to deliver about the fare, but no accolades, either.  The drinks are a bit on the pricey end of normal. The house wine is $8.00 and the Lemon Drop I ordered was $10. Not outrageous, but more than what one would pay at a similar corporate chain restaurant.  Finally, the place is called Cheesecake Factory for a reason. Numerous varieties of that delicious pastry are available and if you like them as much as do I, you won't be disappointed. Personally, the Red Velvet is my favorite, but I plan on trying the numerous other varieties over time. Finally, The Cheesecake Factory is a  restaurant that does what it does without having a unique experience and serves good, though not exceptional food. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to eat here, but if you know what you're getting into, and want to take home a delicious cheesecake for a midnight snack, give it a shot.  Pros: CHEESECAKES. Extensive menu means that even pick eaters will be able to find something they enjoy. Cons: Not much to offer in terms of ambiance, and while the food food is nominally good, nothing stands. Verdict: Recommended IF someone else is paying, or a group can't decide what kind of good to eat that night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=200,3.32,3.52,3.52,3.1480000000000006,3.4400000000000004

All I had remembered the menu is HUGE and the cheesecake is tasty.  We were going to get Mexican, but it was 5pm and the height of rush hour.. we sat for 15-20 minutes and didn't even get barely a mile. We were both in the ""I'm too hungry to talk to you, be nice to you, or not scream in traffic"" kind of mood, so we pulled into the mall, thinking we'd just walk around and get something from the cafeteria.. and then we walked towards Cheesecake Factory, because of where we parked, and we decided to give it a go. We were sat pretty quickly. I noticed it was in the middle of happy hour and waited a few minutes for drinks and bread. One lady walked by and dropped off some bread, some rye? pumpernickel? with oats?  I don't know, but it's good.  I think it's the same as O-u-t-b-a-c-k bread actually. AN-Y-way, We ordered about 10 minutes in.. we finished our bread and almost our drinks..  and before I knew it, we had been sitting there for over 40 minutes and still no food, no bread refill. The table that showed up after us, was getting their food. I was sure they didn't order before us.. I was about to get angry, when our food was placed in front of us. He got a turkey avocado sandwich, which he inhaled, with sweet potato fries.. which we brought home. I ordered the Chicken Bellagio, which besides sounding like a fancy-as-$#@! name, is delicious. Crispy baked chicken on top of basil pasta with a bit of a buttery creamy sauce, with prosciutto and arugula and parmesan cheese on top of that.  The first bite was delicious.. and then then next and the next and the next.. and soon I realized how RICH and savory it really was, and decided to box up over half of the plate to bring home.  The waitress came back by and we asked for the check and a piece of the Adam's chocolately peanut buttery fudge ripple cheesecake to go.  We ate it later at home and it did not disappoint. Overall, if the food sucked, this place would be a 1 or 2 star experience, because tonight's service was not impressive.  However, we both really enjoyed our meals, so there's your saving grace. After all, the actual food can have an impact on how you feel about a restaurant.. sometimes. We have a bunch of food leftover, and I'm not sure if I'd go back necessarily, unless someone specifically requested it, or it was the only thing open, but 3 stars for this experience.

This is problematic because it appeared it was contaminated with wheat flour noodles. I actually ended up getting pretty sick from it, as I have an allergy... Sure they have a disclaimer for no gfree kitchen, but I don't understand how other noodles ended up in my pasta. My suspicion is they cook noodles together. That was a big negative to me!

After noticing that the majority of the other guests that were waiting had been seated, I checked with the hostess to find out how much longer our wait would be. When I handed the hostess my pager she looked in the system and she seemed very confused. She checked with another hostess because she could not find our pager number in the system. He told her he paged us already and went back to what he was doing. The original hostess told me to go get the rest of my party and that we would be seated right away. I did that and when we got back to the desk they continued to seat other parties. I finally had to ask if they were going to seat us and eventfully our name was called. I immediately asked to speak to a manager and I explained the situation. She said it's not their fault the pager didn't work. I, of course, understand that if it was true that we received a busted pager, it obviously wasn't their fault but a simple apology would have diffused the situation and in all of my years in customer service, I've never told an angry customer that something wasn't my fault.  The manager did offer to comp an appetizer after I expressed my extreme displeasure with the service I received but when the bill came, the ""free"" appetizer had not been taken off.

We didn't have room for dessert but you can't go to cheesecake factory and not have cheesecake so we got a slice of vanilla bean with 6 spoons!  Simple but amazing creamy rich cheesecake.  It may be my favorite now.

The Perimeter Mall location is not really an exception, you might be able to eat at a lull sometimes but I've seen this place be busy at 3 PM or 9 PM, so it's a bit of a crapshoot. Cheesecake factory always has a huge menu of options, like any place with so many options you'll get some things that are better than others. The fried mac and cheese appetizers are really good, they give you 4 and that will fill 2 people up before any entree itself. I've had entrees like chicken parm, philly cheesesteak, and some of the pasta dishes. I think overall the quantity is huge, they give you a lot for what you're paying. The food doesn't always taste quite cohesive, for example the philly cheesesteak has too many large peppers that kind overpower the meat. Service and quality can be variable sometimes, when it gets busy it can be hard to get a waiter or waitress, and i agree with some of the comments that you might notice a few dirty plates/utensils because they didn't clean it well (perhaps they just put it in a washer without scrubbing completely). I do think they try to make the place clean but with so much foot traffic the quality of cleanliness seems to drop sometimes. Overall it kinda does feel like a factory, there's large quantities of decent food at ok prices, but a lot of small details can get overlooked with service and cleanliness.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=140,3.16,3.44,3.44,2.636,3.3280000000000007

Then another waiter came apologized for the confusion, took drink order, appetizer order and main entree order.  I thought we were on the right path when the drinks and hot bread (full serving) with butter arrived at our table within 5 mins.  Waited another 25 mins - no appetizer or waiter.  After overhearing a table near us complain while speaking to the manager, we PAID for our drinks and left after wasting 2 hours attempting to eat ( we only waited 15-20 mins to be seated).  Will never go to Perimeter location again.

Granted, this location is next to Perimeter Mall, and the restaurant is always overwhelm with customers (so I don't blame them for not implementing a tradition ""Call-ahead reservation system"".

One thing I never understand at this Cheesecake Factory is that they call my buzzer and let me wait for another 10 minutes every time. Anyway, our waiter seated us. At first his service was pretty decent, he took our order very carefully, even kneed down to the floor because he couldn't hear us very well. We ordered bufflo chicken meatball and decided to share Louisiana chicken pasta since we decided to save up our appetite for some cheesecake! He offered us water as we wanted pretty fast and then VANISHED. And things went down from this point. Nobody brouht us any bread or butter, we just sat for our meals with an empty stomach for over 20 minutes since the restaurant was packed. Here comes the worst part, our meal came out before our appetizer! How ridiculous was this! My boyfriend and I were so starving that we even didn't care about this ""accident"". The waiter who  brought our entree ( not our waiter) heard about our meatball didn't come, he asked us whether wanted to wait for it first, we just too eager to eat and  let it go. When we almost half done with our meal, the appetizer came out,  as I imagined, it was cold. I don't know how long it was seated under the heat lamp but it was definitely not fresh. I was pretty irritated by what happened there, but to this moment, our waiter even didn't show up once to check on us or refill up our water. I just finished our meal really quickly and decided to leave ASAP. Right before we finished our pasta he showed up with the dessert menu, I just ignored him and asked for the bill.

202,John E.,"Atlanta, GA",1070,642,7819.0,3.0,2016-03-14,"You can find this location of the Cheesecake Factory at 4400 Ashford Dunwoody Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30346 towards the northeastern corner of Perimeter Mall (far right when facing the main entrance from Ashford Dunwoody Rd). Parking is easiest from the lot to the right in front of Dillards department store and walking across, unless you want to pay the valet but you'll still end up walking a bit so I'd advise you to forego that inconvenience. I have a feeling that most of you have had the experience of the Cheesecake Factory - the first built (and now closed and replaced by a different location) in Buckhead at one time was the highest-grossing restaurant in the US. I believe this location was the second or third built in Atlanta and it's a really fantastic location. The interior has a fantasy array of Byzantine columns, wonderful fantasy-like wall sconces and very feminine fresco-like murals on a warm tan stucco adorning the ceilings - quite nice and it will make you feel a bit like you've entered a Disney theme park restaurant, however much like said-park the experience hardly meets the promise. I've worked in this area of Dunwoody for 15 or so years off-and-on so I've had many occasion to eat at this Cheesecake Factory. It's not a bad place to meet for special occasions as they can accommodate large parties - for my most recent visit I met with many coworkers for a bittersweet occasion - a member of our team was leaving for another work opportunity. When you are seated you'll be presented with a booklet of many, many items and now I'll voice my biggest gripe. The menu is much too large - I mean it's so big that there's advertising on some of the pages - is it a menu, or a catalog? I really don't see how any restaurant can offer so many dishes and hope to do all of them well. The last thing I want to see is a binder full of pages - where do you start? What's good? What's not? Too many choices.  The food here, and I've tried dozens of items, is passable - no real standouts from the many appetizer or entree sections. I honestly can't recommend any one item as something that's your missing or something you can't get elsewhere and I think this is where the restaurant's identity takes a hit. You're sitting in this fantastic setting yet with one exception, the food is pretty humdrum. We'll get to that exception shortly. I do like the basket of bread that they bring out - something about that wheat bread I really like. But then again, don't come here for the bread. When I think about the food here it reminds me a bit of TGI Fridays. Not that they are all that similar, but the food is very formulaic which is both a good and bad thing. It's good in that there's usually some semblance of food balance - starch to fat to acid ratios are good. It's bad in that the combinations are a bit tired - not much magic here. For mall food it's good and certainly better than the food court - of course you're paying more for it as well. Back to the Fridays comparison - I think the food here is better than Friday's as it's less snacky and more of a meal. Satisfying but not awesome. The exception of course are the desserts. I am not a big fan of cheesecake - it tends to sit very heavy with me, but I'll concede that the cheesecakes here are exceptional. I also like the Sunday and the ice cream in general. And maybe that's the point - I mean it is called ""The Cheesecake Factory"" so perhaps everything leading up to the dessert is just the build up to the big finish? But if so, why the phone-book menu? My final point is about the service. I find it very hit-or-miss. I've received both exceptional service and horrible service and it doesn't seem to matter what size the party is - sometimes the service is amazing on a group of 20 and terrible on just two. No rhyme or reason for it. I've had so many orders get screwed up here and it's really unclear if it was the server or the kitchen. I've had tables where everything showed up together except one lost plate and it took 20 minutes for it to appear with everyone either finished or sitting in front of cold plates, to wrong items showing up, to meals with food restrictive (bacon) items showing up with extra (bacon), etc. When service is good the server is usually very attentive and fixes any mistakes quickly. When service is bad you can't find the server and the attitude is really crappy. Like I said, hit-or-miss. So what's my final overall opinion? I think The Cheesecake Factory is exceptional for their desserts. The appetizer and entrees are mediocre but palatable and certainly better than mall food. The service hit-or-miss. Would I eat there again? Sure as it's close and useful for certain situations. Do I find myself wanting to go here? No. On a scale of 1-5, it's a fairly solid 3 due to the desserts.

So we wait for 45 minutes then we were seated at a table that was too small for the 8 of us. They made us get up and wait another 30 - 45 minutes. So by the time we were sitting down we were pretty mad. We all ordered and the waitress was nice but still awful service. We received the food after we waited for another 30 minutes.

I ended up killing one on the window but more kept coming and along the window seal my friend pointed out lots of dead little bugs... Gnats, flies... yeah so I wanted to move immediately... Should've take that as a hint to leave the restaurant completely but we were starving and wanted a quick bite before the movies and The Pub was packed.... should've tried The Cowfish place...  So we move to another table... no bugs near by but they cleared the table we left and reset it like nothing happened... they didn't even clean the window seal after we'd pointed out there were dead bugs on it...  I felt bad for the people they sat at the table right after us... I could still see little flies buzzing around that window...  So we decide on our food and while we wait we munch of the regular ol' bread they bring out... The wheat bread was fine, but the sourdough was odd, so we just picked at it...  It didn't take long for our food to come out and initially everything looked ok but it just went to meh in a hand basket as we started to eat.   I ordered the factory nachos, which I've ordered numerous times before and they came out luke warm with globs and Globs of cheese melted on top... I ate what I could but it turned into a soggy unappetizing mess before I could get a quarter of the way through them.  There was a pool of grease underneath the pile of soggy chips and I just gave up.  I drank my strawberry lemonade and waited for my friend to finish the chicken sandwich she wasn't really happy with.  She said the chicken was falling apart and not in a good way... It was probably reheated from earlier... she said the toppings didn't help it either...   Anyway as we were leaving the restaurant, I told her next time we come back to Perimeter Mall... I wouldn't be suggesting Cheesecake factory at all... Just a bad experience all around and their saving grace was the super nice server we had...  Only saving grace... only.  So many other options to choose from at Perimeter and after today even the foodcourt will be an option before we come back here...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=60,2.48,3.04,3.04,3.0160000000000005,2.8160000000000003

Our entire party wasn't there yet, so most of us had to be there to be seated.  Our server seemed quite rude and stand-off-ish. From the moment should spoke to us, she didn't seem so friendly. Weird because we're a friendly group haha. There were little things that bothered us about her, especially her serving etiquette. Our last person came late, and he literally had to stand even though we asked for a chair the moment we sat down. He went to the bathroom and came back, and we still didn't have a chair yet. We ended up having to flag down a hostess to bring us a chair. If you requested anything from her, she would walk away without saying a word. We received our appetizers but no plates, so we had to flag someone else down for plates. Then for dessert, I asked for plates with forks and she gave me just plates.  I ordered the steak diane with shrimp scampi. The portion of steak is very small, but the portion of shrimp and mashed potatoes is plenty. The shrimp scampi is not what I'm accustomed to. I assumed it would be sautéed shrimp in a butter and garlic sauce, but it was breaded shrimp in a creamy sauce. Not a fan.  I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in awhile, so I remember the slices of cheesecake being humongous, but I guess they're a lot smaller now. Still tastes good though. For appetizers, if you like buffalo chicken, then I highly recommend the Buffalo Blasts. Its shredded buffalo chicken with cheese then deep fried. It's a huge portion!

They stopped serving my favorite snack - buffalo chicken meatballs.  They were so delicious and a perfect appetizer size.  I hate that they no longer carry them.  That being said, I console myself with the fresh kale salad and sausage and ricotta flatbread.  My favorite cheesecake is the key lime (... but I also like pumpkin when it's in season.)  I used to avoid CF because their portion sizes were so large but now with their small plate options, it's a much more reasonable place to consider for lunch or dinner.   I'm writing this review because I think people sleep on the good cocktails that are made at CF.  If you work in the area, the CF bar is a great place for happy hour.  The drink sizes are generous, suitably potent and worth their price point.  My favorites are the Mai Tai and J.W.'s Lemonade. You're not drinking a ""crafted cocktail"" but you're drinking a well-made cocktail and that's okay too. I usually sit at the bar here and service is okay.  I don't hate it but I don't love it.  They could be more attentive, but this isn't a five-star restaurant so we have to take what we get. *le sigh* Yelp 100 #46",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=60,2.84,3.04,3.04,2.7640000000000002,2.9600000000000004

The hostess was very friendly and surprisingly  there was no wait so our party of 4  was seated immediately out on the patio.   We waited for our waitress for about 15 minutes before she showed up to take our drink orders.  After our waitress  dropped the drinks off and walked away we waited for another 10 minutes for her to come back to take our food orders. I had a Strawberry Daiquiri which lacked flavor and alcohol. Everyone at my table ordered the Ceasar Salad and their Ceasar dressing was flavorless, it tasted like I was eating lettuce with heavy cream on top, the salad was a total fail. Since their portions are typically big enough to feed a family of 4 I opted to just order a appetizer.  I ordered the bang bang salmon wraps which looked delicious from the  description , I assumed bang bang meant spicy but apparently I was wrong, the Salmon was fishy and the flavors did not go well together. The other members at the table seemed ok with their selections with the exception of my one niece who did not like her entrée. Although during most of our dinner, our waitress was not very attentive, she did make every attempt to make sure my niece liked her dish by bringing out sauces and when that failed even though we didn't ask or complain she removed the Uneaten dish from our bill. To top off what started off as a horrible birthday dinner, our waitress brought out a birthday dessert for my niece because she overheard us talking about it.

We were met with blank stares (by the afternoon manager) and shuffled off to a noisy seat by the kitchen after asking to be moved from a boring, cramped, two-top booth looking out to the side parking lot. I explained to the manager and staff that I was taking my son out for lunch after college finals and we wanted to enjoy the space (which was not at all crowded at 3:30 pm). Over the din of tacky tourist muzak and clattering plates and glasses, I asked that we move again, this time a little closer to the bar. Again, the room is nice and airy, but the tacky muzak just beats down on your mind and provides great cover for the waitrons to momentarily acknowledge the customer, throw stuff on the table and keep moving.  My son said his Kobe beef burger was great. My ""Jambalaya"" pasta was so-so...spicey and plentiful, but frozen shrimp and dry chicken place keepers were inexpertly prepared and presented.  ""Close...but no cigar"". The contempt by the manager and staff for the suckers whom wander in to overpay for the mediocre, loud tourist experience is pretty thinly veiled--but given cover by the relentless cacophony pressing down from above. Why unlock the doors and let folks in if you don't really want them there? I mean...show more love, man. Turn the Muzak down a little.  What a shame.

Service was staffed accordingly as we strolled in quickly and we're seated in less than 60 seconds.  If anyone has ever been to this place, you know the decor, menu, bar and dessert area is all the rave. The menu boasts 45 pages at last count, with too many options for you to consider in the 5 minutes the server leaves you to decide the next phase of your journey. Joy, our server was phenomenal! She offered her suggestions as I asked because our party of 4 has some questions and I was on the fence with going to my 'old trusty' or venturing out to something new. We ended up with sliders, fries for a meal, fished tacos, salad/black beans, and Monte Cristo sandwiches.  The hibiscus lemonade is the bomb-not too sweet and won't send you into diabetic shock, lol. Considering we were ordering dessert, we definitely wanted to snag some cheesecake on out way out, we ate light today. When the food arrived, it came out hot, fast and correct. This establishment rarely gets the order wrong, although I admit I almost ordered my son's food incorrect if I had not been reminded to add cheese to his sliders, and just ketchup and nothing else. Our server Joy was very friendly and gracious and make the adjustment immediately.  As I stated before, we arrived before noon, so we saw a ample supply of empty tables, however that changed by noon- almost 50% capacity. The bar boasts a big screen TV where you're invited to chat with the bartender or servers. The temperature was nice enough for outdoor seating although I wasn't sure if that's an option this time of year. We ended our experience on our way out and ordered some cheesecake.

Though Cheesecake can be a headache with long waits and too many options, its always the perfect option to cater to all cravings.  Yesterday, I finally satisfied my craving of a burger with the skinnylicious burger.  Though I didn't really eat skinnylicious when I ate a good portion of my fiance's Louisiana chicken salad on top of their bread lol. That brings me to their awesome Hawaiian and sour dough bread! Try to tame yourself though, you get all your carbs before the actual meal, which we usually do.   Typically we come to cheesecake without getting cheesecake due to the HUGE portion sizes here but great for sharing.  Some of our favorite plates are:    -Luau chicken salad that comes with crispy wonton flakes that you break up with tangy and sweet dressing -Louisiana chicken pasta - flash fried chicken cutlets with peppery and creamy bowtie pasta -Pasta carbonara that's creamy and bacony with a spoonful of green peas (That counts as veggies!) This is one of my favs but totally made out of carbs, hence the name. -Cajun jambalaya pasta - Bountiful of chicken and shrimp with fresh tomatoes on top.  Pretty tasty! -Chicken lettuce wraps - Awesome taco alternatives by substituting the tortilla.  Flavored with Asian sweet sauce. And the list is endless... But on top of it all, they have skinnylicious cocktails so you don't have to skimp out on Friday night celebration or any celebration. IF you have room for cheesecake, I would highly recommend the banana pudding cheesecake.  Even for those who doesn't like cheesecake will like this with fresh bananas and cheesecake so airy and fluffy with light, refreshing banana flavor. Cheesecake offers all and will leave you full everytime!

""Renee's Special""  (who's Renee?) is a good deal.  Half turkey or chicken salad sandwich, a bowl of soup AND a salad for $12.50. Well looky here: they brought me a whole sandwich!  But the chicken salad was null and void.  Right proportion of chicken to mayo, but not enough zing.  Rather than a choice of soups -- surely they should have at least two -- the restaurant only prepares one per day.  Yesterday's soup du jour was 'loaded potato': thick, gloppy, highly caloric, not my thing.  (For what it's worth, Ellen enjoyed hers.)   The field green salad was fine -- a good-sized portion -- and the balsamic vinaigrette dressing -- ""on the side, please"" -- was excellent.

This was probably the first time I had been in a Cheesecake Factory in years... and it was disappointing.  It's great that they put how much calories their food contains on their menu, but this sucked in the sense that I went from wanting a cheesecake to not wanting one at all because of how much calories are in these slices of cheesecake. The cheesecakes I originally wanted to try were all around ~1500 calories per slice... Wow, that's about all the daily caloric intake I need in one whole day. I ended up compromising for a tiramisu cheesecake which had just a little below 1000 calories. The cheesecake was just okay. It may have been in the freezer/fridge for a bit too long because the cake portion of the cheesecake had a stale fridge taste to it (like it's been soaking up the smell of whatever else was in the fridge with it).

They put all the toppings like lettuce, tomato, etc on the side, and they gave me honey mustard on request. They make their own so it's really good. They also sell all their sauces up front in to go.  You should also try such items as avocado eggrolls because if you love avocados, it's pretty much a must! Also, the chicken Bellagio is a pasta dish that packs some flavor without looking like it's doing a whole lot.  Don't do the artichoke appetizer; it's a whole artichoke so you're going to be biting each tint edible bit off of each hard non edible bit.

74,A G.,"Lithonia, GA",0,1,,1.0,2017-03-23,"To whom it may concern, This is a two-part story, I visited your Cheesecake Factory at Perimeter on 2 occasions and the experience was very unacceptable. 1st occasion, we went in January of 2017 on a Saturday around noon or so, we were placed in a booth; 15-20 mins passed; no server came and I decided this isn't going to go well, lets just leave. The restaurant was empty because it just opened therefore my motto is, if it don't feel right, just go. 2nd occasion, March 22nd, 2017.  We went after shopping and the wait was not long, maybe 15mins;  It was me, my son and girlfriend.  My Waiter-Marcus came and we ordered our drinks, food, and appetizer.  Everything rolling along fine until we placed our order.  Appetizer came out within 15mins, after that radio silence. My girlfriend ordered the turkey burger, I ordered the Gumbo, and my son order the Filet Mignon, therefore we were spending a good amount of money w/ drinks.  After 25-30 mins, we looking around like where is the food; Marcus comes by and says nonchalantly let me check on your food.  About 5 mins later (30-35 total),  turkey burger came and Gumbo. I ordered my gumbo w/ white rice which sits in the middle of the bowl, this one had brown rice. I told the server I order Gumbo w/ white rice. The server said here I will bring you out some white rice, I said no take this back, that is not what I ordered. He stated it only sits in the middle.  I am like, did he just try and give me a different version of what I order and wanted me to make the adjustments on the plate that I am paying for.  I told him to take the plate back and bring it out correctly.  During this point our server Marcus is no-where to be found in response to the mishap.  And notice, I did not mention my sons plate, because he hasn't received it.  So now, here comes my corrected Gumbo w/ white rice, no apology or anything.  Also here comes the Filet Mignon w/ mashed potatoes and green beans. My son ordered a Filet Mignon w/ French fries and broccoli. We look at the plate and say, are you serious?  Mind you that's a $30 dollar dish, at this point Marcus appears and I inform him, this is not what we ordered, His response, "" I'll bring him out some fries and broccoli"" (i.e No accountability or apology).  He brings out a bowl of broccoli and unseasoned fries, and says my bad to my son.  At this point, Marcus isn't even worth eye contact because I'm upset. I am the type of person that if good service and quality food is provided, I will forever patron your restaurant.  Because, I can count on feeling good about the entire experience.  I don't know why the service was so horrible nor do I care because I am the customer and Marcus was the face of Cheesecake at that point.  You had 3 orders, got 1 right and 2 wrong, that's 33.3%; that's below failing.  I hate when people do not tip and give good service a hard time, but on occasions like these, I see no reason for anyone to hold back if they want that type of confrontation.  Me, I am a little more reserved and better voicing my opinion in other ways, such as this.   Finally when the check comes, there isn't an apology or nothing.  I am like this is ridiculous.  I expect more from a location such as yours and its disheartening knowing people aren't treated with the type of service they are paying for, And the only reason Marcus got a tip which was 14.00 dollars on a 100.00 tab is because we chose to come and eat there.  But, let that had been no tip, the only comment would have been, black people don't tip, even though the service you provided was awful; between you and the kitchen staff.   I am not a waiter but if I was, my main goal would be to provide the type of service that you cant deny giving me an exceptional tip no matter what is going on in my life, that is blocked out because I am working.

A local diner can do this better. Breakfast for 4 people took 45min for the food. We are not talking about peak hours. It was 10:50am!  - Bad service staff: even after I complained about the food, she still included full amount for something I didn't eat in the bill.  - The WORST manager: this is the root cause of everything. Their management is really bad. I called the manager and explained my experience. He had no facial expression and he did NOT say the word ""sorry"" at all.

It was not crowded outside ... got my drink fairly quickly, but my wife's never came.  The waitress finally, after maybe 15 more minutes, came to take our food (dinner salads only) orders - never coming back to offer a drink re-fill to me or additional bread.  When our order didn't come after 30 more minutes (about 1 hour total being there ... and, again, it was NOT crowded outside!!), we decided to leave.  I went inside and asked for a manager to tell her we were leaving and I would pay for my drink - and she was as pathetic as our waitress - only said she was sorry - never said something like ""please hold on, let me check to find out what's the problem"".  I then walked outside with her and pointed out our table where my wife was still sitting - she then walked back inside to a computer screen, presumably to see what we had ordered and when.   My wife later told me that while I was inside talking with the manager, the waitress came to our table with a drink re-fill for me and said she'd check on our meals (salads, no less) that had been ordered about 30 minutes prior, and my wife told the waitress that we were leaving and the waitress just said ""ok"", never apologizing or saying she would get a manager.  My wife then walked up and the manager never offered us anything such as a complimentary meal in the future, a take-out of our order for free, or even a dessert to go --- and she never said anything about finding out what had gone wrong - she just said, ""I'm sorry"" - right, that only goes so far. - pitiful customer service.  We've been to this Cheesecake Factory at Perimeter Mall many, many times, and told that to the manager, but that didn't seem to phase her.  We have never walked out of a restaurant due to poor service, but everyone failed here - absolutely the waitress, presumably the kitchen and definitely the manager.  BOTTOM LINE - WE WILL NEVER GO BACK HERE, NEVER!

It takes me a long time to figure out what I want to eat, so I usually pick it out on the online menu ahead of time. I feel reviewers are slightly biased against chains - keep that in mind when you view a chain restaurant's score. Reviewers favor restaurants that are not well known- it's like a hipster mentality thing. They give these novel one - of - a - kind spots raving reviews, and then when you go there, you're like, why was everyone raving about that? There's a reason why there are 20,000 MacDonalds, but every MacDonalds somehow has a 2 star rating *thoughtful finger on chin emoji*. You know where chain restaurants actually rack up big points?

65,Rachel P.,"Schererville, IN",99,2,6.0,1.0,2017-04-30,I wish there was a way to rate this Cheesecake Factory less than one star because it doesn't even deserve one star. I don't even know where to begin. After we were seated it took a good 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged our presence to get us drinks. We then waited an hour for our food & when we finally did get our food 3 out of 5 meals were cold. When we informed the waiter about it he asked if we would like him to heat it up for us and then informed us that the area where the pasta is cooked is not working properly so none of the pasta items were cooked correctly but still brought it to the table for us to eat knowing it was not up to standards. We also only saw our waiter maybe every 30 minutes. My friend ordered a lunch menu item and because we were there for so long they then charged her item as a dinner entree because lunch was now over. (Even though when we ordered our food it was still lunch) I think our drinks were refilled once in the 2+ hours we were there. The table next to us waited almost 20 minutes until their order was even taken & the table on the other side got up and left because no one ever came to help them. Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants but me and my party of 5 will probably never be returning after this awful ridiculous experience.

The hostess didn't introduce herself, didn't welcome me to the cheesecake factory did not say thank you and moved 2 people in front of me even though i was the first one in! This happens a lot in Georgia the only thing i can assume is because i am not of the same ethnicity. Coming from the west coast this has never been a problem but it happens all the time only with women in Georgia. Then the girl who seated me actually went out of her way not to give me what i wanted. I asked if i could sit in a booth and was told there is no server in that section, and low and behold there are now people sitting in that area. Maybe its just me but i think her attitude and LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE stinks. I'm just visiting Atlanta and this will be the last time i will come to the Cheesecake Factory here.

Today I ordered the House Salad and Pizza combo from their lunch menu.  The house salad consists of greens with tomatoes and choice of dressing.  The pizza options are from the regular menu, it is just a bit smaller on the lunch menu.  I am usually a big fan of their food, but today, even though the pizza had lots of toppings, I had to eat it with a fork because the middle was soggy. :(  I'm hoping this was a fluke - as I have not had this issue in the past.

My friend ordered the angel hair shrimp pasta and oh my gosh, that was the worst thing ever! The noodles were no where near al dente and basically melted in my mouth, and that's not a good thing. The noodles just broke apart because they were so over cooked. Plus, the portion was oddly small for a Cheesecake Factory plate. We also ordered an appetizer, the fried tods.

135,Terry H.,"Atlanta, GA",0,79,219.0,3.0,2017-07-30,"I've been eating at Cheesecake Factory ever since they opened their DC location in 1993, the chain's 4th location and 1st location outside California.  Despite wait times often exceeding 3 hours (and my limited dining budget), it was part of my regular restaurant rotation.   While I don't frequent the chain nearly as often as I did, it has always been a great choice for quality food and good service. Unfortunately, today was different.  It was National Cheesecake Day but we arrived around 11am while the restaurant was still half empty.  I ordered the Spinach and Cheese dip and Cajun Jambalaya pasta.  The food was served in a timely manner and the food tasted great.  But aside from taking our initial order, our server was nowhere to be found.  We waited and waited for drink refills or for anyone to check on our table. Once we were done with the food, we were ready to order dessert.  My dining partner ordered a cheesecake and I ordered the Apple Cobbler.  We also asked for drink refills.  A few minutes later, the server returned to inform me that the restaurant sold out of Apple Cobbler.  Not a big deal if this was a mom and pop restaurant but this is a billion dollar company that should be better at supply chain management.  Worse yet, I never got my refill.  If he hadn't taken my glass, I could have quenched my thirst with the melting ice but with no glass, I just finished my meal and ate dessert without a drink. Our server was friendly but hardly present. Not sure if he was inexperienced or if the restaurant was understaffed.  Either way, the service was below expectations for the Cheesecake Factory.   I hope this was an isolated experience and not the new standard.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2,2.88,2.91,3.156,2.572,2.8979999999999997

136,Charlie H.,"Lawrenceville, GA",7,4,5.0,4.0,2017-08-01,"I should be coming here for the desert right? Nope! Not to say that their Cheesecakes are bad, because they are anything but, I actually really like their food! If anyone has seen the menu, then you will know right away that the menu is more like a short story book rather than a typical menu, which some people will have a problem with, but I don't mind too much. During my most recent visit to this establishment, which was indeed quite recent, I have to say, I was quite impressed with how everything went! Usually when I do go to Cheesecake Factory, I always expect slow service, like really slow... However, to much of my party's surprise, everything went quite smooth and efficient. Whenever we are around this area, especially around dinner time, there are always a lot of options to choose from. So when we decided to go to Cheesecake Factory, we were expecting to wait 30-45 minutes (at least) to be seated, however, it only took us 15 minutes to be seated! I think that should be considered an all time record, especially since it was during a weekend afternoon. So after we got seated, we were greeted by a very lovely server, named Nikki (sorry if not spelled correctly). She took our drink orders and in no time at all, we had our drinks. She was also very fast in bringing our bread and butter, and if you know me, I love me some complimentary bread! After our table basically devoured the bread, she was so kind to ask us if we wanted more, and of course I said yes. Again, her service was exceptionally fast! Whenever I do go out with the family, we sometimes decide to eat family style (sharing entrees) which we did for this night, after we ordered our food, she brought us extra entree size plates without us having to ask. Again, Cheesecake Factory has a good amount of things to choose from, and whenever I go, I have to have at least one pasta entree (they make good pastas!). Because their portions are quite large, you could easily share one entree for two people. We ended up getting a Pasta Carbonara w/o chicken ($16.50), a Crispy Chicken Costoletta ($17.95), and a Factory Chopped Salad ($12.50). The food came out within 15-25 minutes and everything tasted great! The Carbonara is always made well, the chicken was seasoned well and had a nice crispy bite to it, and the salad was delicious, dressed with just the right amount of dressing. I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 because the service for this particular day was phenomenal, again, thanks to our server Nikki, and the food was superb. If they continue with this type of great service, as well as continuing serving good food, this place will easily be a 5 star for me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2,2.92,2.93,3.148,2.6719999999999997,2.926

I ultimately went with 3, because to get a 2 from me there usually has to be something definitively wrong with the place. And there is nothing wrong per se with Cheesecake Factory at Perimeter.  I just do not find the food special, and for the price it really should be something special.  This location is located at Perimeter Mall.  It gets pretty busy as most Cheesecake Factories. Being at a mall there is usually not a major issue parking, just a matter of how close you can get.  There are plenty of jokes around about the size of the menu at the Cheesecake Factory.  It certainly has a huge selection. I tend to suspect that is why nothing is special. If you try to be everything, then nothing is great. Some of the best places in my opinion have a few things they do, and they do them well.  Last time I went to Cheesecake Factory it was me and my wife for lunch. I had a buffalo chicken sandwich and my wife had a not memorable pasta dish. No alcohol and our bill was almost $40.  Again, nothing wrong with the food. The food was just okay and the service was fine.

I can understand not worrying about a table if it isn't yours but if you see menus on the table with no bread for an extended period of time, it's just curtious to ask if we have been helped. I honestly thought that we were being treated that way because the servers did not think we were going to tip them well. But it is not fair for someone to judge us before they even served us. We had to inform someone that we had not been seen. And even after we told the hostess we were still not seen. I had to ask for a manger to explain that we had been waiting for so long and it was not fair especially since all the surrounding restaurants were preparing to close. Otherwise I would have gladly just left. The manager quickly sat us down and our server was great.

If you are looking for a place with an extensive menu and a plethora of cheesecakes then this is the place to go. Now about the Perimeter Mall location...whoever the young lady was working take-out two weeks ago, she had a very sour attitude and lied to me about them discontinuing a menu item after we had a disagreement on the name of the item. I was trying to order cauliflower wings and she stated that they did not sell those. After a few seconds of back and forth and having her get a menu for me, she informed me that they are called Korean fried cauliflower and that that menu item has been discontinued. Therefore, that day I left only with a slice of pumpkin cheesecake. Well then, why to my surprise did I go back to CF this past weekend and I was magically able to order the Korean fried cauliflower? Smh, not a way to build customer rapport. Also, I don't know when or why restaurants started doing this, but there were three people in my party and each person got their food at a different time, the last person getting his 20-25 minutes after the second person.

There was a combination of flavors to include garlic, onion, and pineapple- which added a nice sweetness. The chicken and shrimp were fried and tossed in the sauce as well.

112,Ming N.,"Atlanta, GA",0,37,4.0,2.0,2017-12-17,"Service was incredibly slow today, you can maybe chalk it up to the holidays but I'm pretty certain this is probably pretty normal. 10 minute wait for someone to come bus the table, another 10 for the server to show up, about 25 minutes for the food to come out. Food was kind of lackluster and bland. Normally when you think of Cheesecake Factory you think gargantuan portions. Not the case today.  Overall our server was not attentive, she was too busy talking with another employee. The only reason for more than 1 star, is their cheesecake is still pretty decent. Won't dine in again at this location, if I go back to a CF it will just be for the cheesecake, to go....ordered in advance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=20,2.64,2.79,3.028,,2.7300000000000004
113,Angela S.,"Sandy Springs, GA",18,1,,2.0,2017-12-18,"Visited Perimeter Cheesecake the other day and the waiter got my order incorrect. I ordered the herb crusted salmon and received the grilled salmon (that has grill lines). In the attempt to correct the problem, the manager returns with herbs heated on top of the grilled salmon which was totally incorrect. Herb crusted salmon is not grilled! As to not cause any additional problems like someone tampering with my food by a second refusal, I accepted it unwillingly and picked over it. This was poor customer service in the attempt to disguise what was already an error and pass it off again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=20,2.56,2.76,3.02,,2.68
109,Erika S.,"Lawrenceville, GA",222,12,1.0,1.0,2017-12-20,I use to love this loocation better than all of the other locations but not anymore. I dined their just yesterday and I came in at 10:15pm on a date. The server we had rushed the entire time. Saying things like can you hurry because the kitchen is about to close and that the kitchen is yelling at her to get our food order. I asked her for a recommendation and said well I'm vegan. Then I asked her what's popular and she didn't even reply. My date didn't order anything becauee of it. I ended up ordering the orange chicken which was Cleary rushed as well because the rice tasted undercooked. When I asked the server for more Brown bread she said I don't know because the kitchen is really closed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=20,2.4,2.74,3.02,,2.604
0,Jaclyn K.,"Gainesville, FL",482,5,1.0,1.0,2017-12-27,I am extremely upset about the quality of food at the Cheesecake Factory as it has gone down hill significantly over the years. I called ahead to order the BBQ chicken salad but with shrimp instead of  chicken because i don't eat meat. It was about 9 o'clock on a Wednesday night (not a crowded time). I was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. I arrived in 25 minutes and it was not ready. In fact i don't  believe they event started making it because the girl went back to the kitchen to get it for me and she was gone for over ten minutes. This salad has 6 ingredients (besides the shrimp) and i was charged over $21 which is absurd in an of itself. But they left off one of these ingredients (the fried onions) which i did no notice until i arrived home. Some lettuce and the avocado were also brown. I was also given no butter with my bread. Needless to say i will not ever get food at this location again as this is not what i expected and a huge waste of money.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=40,2.4,2.74,3.012,,2.604

131,George E.,"Marietta, GA",0,7,,1.0,2017-12-30,"We went there for lunch on on 12/28/2017 & I wish we didn't . The Cajun jambalaya was burned , it literally tasted like a burned pan. The shrimp scampi was so oily , it looked like they put a stick of butter in the plate before they warmed it in a microwave. And last but not least, the waiter was pushing us to finish & leave as quick as possible. When we ordered dessert at the end , the waiter said "" to go I assume"".  We have been to different locations many times before & we like it , but this visit to the Dunwoody location ( in perimeter mall) I give it a 0/10.

121,Honesty G.,"Atlanta, GA",0,11,6.0,1.0,2018-01-05,"The cake nightmare!!! I am DONE with Cheesecake Factory. We ordered a Oreo cheesecake for a colleague's birthday with her name written on top. You have to pay extra for the name to be written on a special card to place on the cake.  Upon picking up the cake from CF, the girl proceeded to tell us that they do not have anymore cards, and the name was not written on the cake for that reason. She was not apologetic by any means. She actually looked annoyed. How could you be annoyed? You're not the one that has to give a birthday cake to someone without their name on it. Personalizing a birthday cake is how people feel special on their birthday. This is a very important part, not to mention the fact that we are spending OVER $50 for this cake! Why didn't anyone call us!? Why is the girl behind the counter having an attitude?  Finally the manager comes over, his name was Patrick. He was very nice and at least tried. He wrote the name on the cake. It was not the prettiest but he tried. I gave one star bc he tried. In the future, do not have an attitude with the customer, it isn't their fault that your inventory is not correct and we were not notified. Also if you're going to work in the bakery, and have an attitude, maybe you should work in the back. Bake the cookies, rather eat a cookie and have a smile! She needs a new job. She is lucky she didn't have her name tag on! Patrick thanks for trying... but after $50 that is ridiculous! To others just go to Publix and buy a cake. At least they will not give you an attitude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2,2.08,2.72,2.988,,2.4640000000000004

Most CF locations are average, 3 Stars but this one, this one is a 4. Went here to catch up with friends tonight and had excellent service! The passion fruit mojito was a hit! Served in a martini glass and well made, great bartender! Bravo to you. The avocado egg rolls are good (maybe need a little extra salt). Chinese chicken salad was good too. And as always, great cheesecake, Oreo is my fav...but I got the hot fudge sundae this time, still good. they kept the fresh bread coming...carbs, ice-cream/hot fudge and alcohol...this is key to keeping girls happy :) good job Cheesecake Factory, good job. Well done. FYI it's at the Perimeter mall so parking can get annoying but it's free and a huge lot. Great location.

So I occasionally drop in to sit and the bar and grab some beer or a slice of cake but never both cause I feel like that wouldn't taste good together. They might. I haven't tried. I like the place. The menu is hilariously large so me trying to try everything on the menu who do be a task. I've had most cheesecakes though. Of course #1.
