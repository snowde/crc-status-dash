212,Shana B.,"Atlanta, GA",89,174,11.0,2.0,2012-01-08,"Cheesecake Factory is usually a fun experience with over 300 menu items to choose from and great desserts to try after dinner. However, our experience at the Cheesecake Factory was a disappointing to say the least. The waitress seriously needed to be fired. If I had a dollar for every item that she forgot while she was serving our food, we would have gotten a free meal. When we finally got our food, we were satisfied but it took such a long for the waitress to bring the food out. I also ordered cheesecake as well and I think the waitress mixed up the cheesecake order but we were were so exhausted after complaining so much that we kept whatever she brought us.  In terms of our food, I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and it came with fries. I loved the sandwich and would order it again. As I mentioned earlier, the food was good but the service was AWFUL!!!

I've been to other Cheesecake Factory's on weekends and they weren't as bad as this was....I guess I'm just trying to say it was extremely crowded. The service here (or at least our particular server) left a lot to be desired also. I had to flag down another server on two different occasions just to get our drinks refilled and to get some more bread. Additionally, our server never came back to see how we were doing.....and all of this was reflected in the tip I left for her:) Anyways, good food as always but crappy service.

My mom had the shepherds pie and my sister had the Diane Steak and Shrimp. Both my mom's and sister's food tasted the same because of some wine sauce. Both of their entrees tasted like a Lean Cuisine. Very disappointing. I tried some of  a cheeseburger and that was good. I got there at 7:15 and put my name and in we were finally sat at 8:40.

140,Amanda S.,"Smyrna, GA",49,35,210.0,4.0,2012-11-06,"4.5 Star.  Cheesecake Factory (this one particularly) is a staple favorite of Mine ever since the T.G.I Friday's left Powers Ferry Road in Marietta. It's My go-to for many dinner dates and afternoons with friends.  A party of 2 can expect 20 minute - 1 hour wait times on a Friday or Saturday night. Valet is available on these nights, and it's recommended since parking spaces are few and far between.  The large fountain courtyard is a good place for your party to relax and chat while awaiting a table if sitting at the bar isn't of interest. Like all Cheesecake Factory's, portions are huge, the selections are extensive, the ambiance is lively but romantic under some circumstances, and the interior decor is beautifully designed. The soaring mural ceiling and large windows (which are promptly shaded upon sunset) really give the place a sense of spaciousness. There's an outdoor dining patio scattered with powerful heat lamps so diners can enjoy it even during really chilly evenings, it it also quieter than indoors. I always seem to order the same thing, despite the vast number of items on the  menu.  When I have ventured to try other items, I haven't been disappointed. My favorite order is the Thai Lettuce Wraps followed by a Chinese Chicken Salad.  The Thai lettuce wraps are insanely good and the portion is more than plentiful, it is a meal in itself. There are large lettuce leaves (iceberg and a purple variety?) which you fill with Satay chicken, shredded carrots, bean sprouts, and noodle strings. It is served with 3 different Thai-inspired dipping sauces, they are so delicious, I always order extras of each. Things will get messy with these wraps, but I promise that you wont even care! Other favorite appetizers are the Firecracker Salmon Rolls, Avocado Eggrolls, and Buffalo Blasters - they're awesome and great to share. The Ahi Carpaccio (raw tuna with wasabi and avocado cream) is also wonderful. The Chinese Chicken Salad mountain makes a grand entrance, it is piled high! Crispy rice noodles and wontons, savory grilled chicken, mandarin orange slices, sesame seeds and other toppings grace this delicious Asian-inspired salad. The tasty Chinese plum dressing really sets it off. Yum.  Their orange chicken is pretty good too, it's not actually spicy though and I wish the sauce was heavier. Same goes for their Bang-Bang chicken & shrimp and the Caramel Chicken (which I ordered sans-mushroom) entrees.  The best way to order your drinks is directly at the bar, the bar also offers the perfect diversion if you're stuck waiting for a table. They have added a ""Skinny Drink"" menu, and many other drinks can be made ""skinny"" as well.  On the ""Skinny"" note, I once ordered the grilled artichoke, it was surprisingly tasty.  Once you're seated, even if the place is packed and service is slower than usual, you'll be given a complimentary basket of 2 sliced bread loafs with sweet butter to accompany them. The basket will be replenished upon request. I've always received reasonably good service here, no complaints to make. I rarely order dessert because I'm already bursting at the seams and holding a to-go box by the time I'm finished with My meal. However, you really can't go wrong no matter what you order! I enjoy My cake ala mode when I'm able to indulge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-3?start=160,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.12,3.3200000000000003
247,Marie M.,"Atlanta, GA",206,214,37.0,2.0,2012-11-27,"I will start by saying that I usually love the Cheesecake Factory. But this location is very dissapointing. When we first got there, they greeted us just fine but when we got to the booth that we were supposes to seat at the hostess all of a sudden said that she had to check because they had told her that it might be taken. So, we stood there while she went back to the hostess desk to check and then she moved us to another table. Our server; well, we never learned his name. He never provided it. The drinks took forever and it was only water and one margarita. The plate that they brought my 3 yr old's pizza in was SO hot that the runner felt bad and went back to get another plate to switch the pizza. They didn't have any kind of crayons or anything for kids. The food itself was bland.

199,Jennifer H.,"Atlanta, GA",216,89,572.0,4.0,2012-12-21,"Our family decided to meet here at TCF outside of Cumberland Mall this past Sunday for lunch at noon. I had called earlier on the phone but they do not take reservations even if you are a party of  8. Upon arrival, I had to to circle around several times at the parking lot as it was very crowded. Plus the Christmas season around the corner did not help either. There are a few empty spots reserved for call-in-take-out orders where the staff will bring your meals to you at the assigned parking spots. That is always a plus if you don't have time to sit down. We are a party of 8 and we were seated pretty quickly at noon. It was a big surprise to me as I expected a long wait. Maybe I had been to TCF at  Buckhead way too long.  So I was very happy to find our seats right away. The waiter came to get our drink orders and later came with 2 baskets of bread. There were 2 different kinds of bread that came with the butter slices. For appetizers, we had Margherita Fresh Baked Flatbread. It had Mozzarella, tomato and sprinkled basil on it. The other Flatbread we had was the Wild Mushrooms Flatbread. It was filled with mushrooms, garlic, shallots and fresh herbs. Very yummy. For my main entree, I had the lunch size Luau Salad. It had slices of grilled chicken breast buried with mixed greens, cucumbers, onions, red & yellow peppers, carrots and crisp wontons with some nuts, all tossed in a light vinaigrette. I was hungry and cleaned my plate. My hubby had the Caesar Salad. It was the normal lettuce with croutons, Parmesan cheese and Caesar dressing. It was alright for him but no wow factor attached. My brother-in-law had Sausage and Broccolini Pasta as his entree. It had everything a guy would want - Italian sausage, tomato, fresh Broccolini, spinach and asparagus tossed with Penne pasta and Parmesan cheese. Yum!  It must be delicious because my BIL had a fairly clean plate at the end. My SIL had the Crab Hash from the Sunday Brunch menu. It had poached eggs and Hollandaise sauce on top of sauteed crab meat, red and yellow peppers, onions and potatoes. Please check out my pictures for a better idea. She said she enjoyed every bite of it. I am now hungry thinking of her meal as it is breakfast time now.  Of course I had to save room for my Cheesecake dessert. I had the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake. It was a little too rich for me and I had to take it home with me. However, I did get a bite of my hubby's Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake. It was moist and delicious. The Caramel Mousse did it for me. My SIL had the Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake. The layered cream cheese in between was so good. Of course, I had to get a bite of that too. Overall, everyone had a nice dining experience including the kids. The waiter did come back twice to check on us. He had to adjust my tab since he charged me for an extra cup of hot tea which I did not order. No problem after the adjustment. Food was good, nice atmosphere and ambiance, attentive waiter and cheesecake is always calling my name. So I am coming back!

You're better off using a coupon for domino's and getting more slices. also, the pizza doesn't taste all that great. It's like eating slime on a cardboard shingle. However, I've had their burgers and those are awesome. My friends order the pasta dishes and seemed to love it. The complimentary bread and sweet butter is very tasty.

To the kitchen's credit, they didn't just toss the chicken under the warmer to keep it but actually remade the dish. I had the Firefly martini which was very good but sadly took forever to get. A friend that joined us only had time for a couple of glasses of wine and had to go back to work. She was able to order her second glass, ask the server for the check, give her card, pay for her drinks and about 10 minutes later finally got her glass of wine. She was pretty annoyed as were the rest of us. The food was great but the service was very slow.

I understood that National Cheesecake Day would understandably be a busy day and I expected a long wait to be seated. That part wasn't as bad as I thought. I was quoted an accurate wait time. The bad part was our service. I cannot think of the young man's name that waited on us . That's how crappy our service was. When we were seated he did come immediately to the table and took our drink order. We only ordered water and coke zero. That took 10 minutes in itself. My grandma said he must have placed us on a low priority since we didn't order expensive drinks. When he did come back to our table he did have bread with him which was a plus so I figured he would be very efficient. I thought wrong.  Once our order was taken we never received anymore bread, was never asked if we wanted anymore. I was lucky to get a refill on my water. The expeditor brought out our food. Our waiter almost passed our table before he realized the food was there to ask if we needed anything else. After that, he didn't come back to the table within a span on 20 minutes to ask if our food was okay or even to ask if we wanted to go on and order our cheesecake. I grew so irritated I just got up and ordered my cheesecake from the takeout line. I have worked food service before in every level imaginable, from hostess to manager. So I always try to give the benefit of the doubt on an exceptionally busy day. But when it seems like our table was a second thought to our waiter, that's a whole another thing.

I went during the week around 7-8 so it was a reasonable wait of 5-10 min.  Also ordered some cheesecake (Reese) which was excellent.  I'd have to agree with the title of the restaurant because all of the cheesecake choices looked phenomenal.  While the menu is very diverse, from an assortment of chicken entrees, italian dishes, cheesecakes, sea-food, hamburgers, mexican dishes, etc...it is definitely worth a try especially if you have been holding out as many years as myself.  The service was fast and our server was very friendly/knowledgeable of their menu.  I would highly recommend to anyone in the area to try this delicious eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-3?start=280,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.612,3.5200000000000005

My second sense of displeasure: the hostess was somewhat rude when asked questions. Yet, she took the time to hold conversations with ""friends"" who passed by as they were leaving. My third sense of displeasure: The same rude hostess seated another large party that came in AFTER I did before me.  It took me complaining to TWO managers to get us seated. My fourth sense of displeasure: Our waitress , Sandy B.  It was 5 minutes before she acknowledged us. She asked us for our drink orders, left before we could utter the words ""we're ready to order now"" as we had a loooong wait and knew what we wanted.  She came and sat the drinks down and left again.  However, she was very attentive to the table across from us.  I had to raise my voice  to get her attention as she yet again passed our table so that we could place our orders.  When she finally came to take the order, one of my party put in a special request ""ABSOLUTELY NO TOMATOES"" on her burger.   When our food finally arrived, my pasta dish was overcooked (noodles clumped together and dry); the special request ignored. I was snippily told that the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta was not a ""saucy"" dish.  and grudgingly offered to have a new one prepared.  When told about the tomato, she, instead of apologizing for HER mistake in not forwarding the request, asked whether or not no tomato was requested.  As she walked away, I asked her to make sure that a new turkey burger was prepared and the tomato not simply be removed as the party was allergic, she mouthed ""B&*^H"". Because I had ""impressionable youths"" with me, I did not create a scene. I simply left her a note explaining how I felt about her service.

This experience and a few other like it may have me walking past one of my old favorites. For starters, the bread they served was smashed and not that fresh. We ordered my favorite appetizer the avocado egg rolls. They were okay but not up to standard. My wife and I shared a chipotle chicken pasta that was not up to CF standards. It was supposed to have asparagus but I couldn't find any. It was dry and finally the chipotle was not subtle but overpowering. I'm good w spicy food but this was too much. We added some cream sauce to it but it didn't help. We finished dinner w the Godiva brownie hot fudge sundae. They should've served a microscope at the same time because we could barely find the hot fudge and had to order more. My wife thought the brownie was excellent. Too frufru for me.

They have several flavors - I like the Asian one the most. Mexican ones are a little too plain.  Overall I think Cheesecake Factory has quality food like pasta, salmon.  - good service and a variety of choices. Nothing too special but something for everyone!

Like, so lazy, I did their curbside to go because I didn't want to get out in my pajama pants. So I appreciate the fact that the waitress was efficient and even complimented me that I looked great. I tipped her well. I ordered just a few things: Ahi Tuna Salad: Still really consistent at every Cheesecake Factory I've been to. They keep the tuna chilled, make sure there's lots of fresh greens, and there's more than enough dressing.  Mushroom Flatbread: Not impressed. The portion is good for one person, but it didn't look appetizing with its shape. The taste was ok though, but I probably wouldn't order it or any other flatbreads again. Chicken Samosas: The sauces with the samosas are delicious. The samosas themselves were flavorful and a little too salty for my taste. Then again, I did just order samosas from a chain restaurant that doesn't specialize in Indian cuisine, so I blame myself for that one. I was just too ashamed to order something like southwest eggrolls. So Cheesecake Factory is still a good ol standard to eat that's a step-up from the other fast foods.

We areived at 7 and had a cocktail then I got notified that our 14 was now 16. I went to let the host know at 7:30 that it was going to be 16..in which I was told ""well we will see what we can do"" ok, no prob. Here comes 8:45 with no word on the table, when asked we were told since we added two more people it will take longer. Ridiculous.  We then asked to speak to a manager and let him know the situation and he, again, told us the extra two people are what screwed everything up. Longer story short... we get seated at 9. We had a waiter and waitress. Isabella and a swrver who will remain nameless..

209,Marcia A.,"Powder Springs, GA",5,4,1.0,2.0,2014-08-16,"Went this evening with the family.  Upon arrival we were greeted by a hostess who clearly has no enthusiasm for people or her job.  She didn't smile and barely made eye contact.  As I surveyed the staff, I saw the gloomiest crews of wait staff I think I've ever seen.  No smiles, no pleasant greetings, the total opposite. Everyone looked angry.  So, so much for atmosphere.  Our waiter was pretty ho hum about taking care of us but luckily his shift was up and early in he was replaced with someone who had a bit more enthusiasm for his job.  Interestingly enough my daughter had pointed him out earlier as the only one in the place (on the staff) who was smiling.  So we lucked up and got him as a waiter, he did a pretty good job of being attentive, too.   As you  probably know, the menu is massive.  They have plenty to choose from, which always worries me in a restaurant.  We ordered Calamari, Edamame, Chicken Picatta, Seafood gumbo, salmon salad, 4 cheese lasagne with chicken and 3 different kinds of cheesecake - vanilla bean, oreo cookie and classic/strawberry.  First the appetizers and dinner was a big disappointment.  My daughter enjoyed her 4 cheese lasagne but the rest of us kept trying to add salt because it was so bland.  The chicken picatta had none of that lemony dill flavor you expect, even though it was covered in lemons and capers.  The salad had to be doused w/more salad dressing and the salmon hit with table salt. The gumbo was spicy but that was all. It was pretty...well, ""Meh"".  The bright spot was the cheesecake.  We all enjoyed our cheesecake.  The oreo cookie was everyone's favorite.  It was huge and super rich. If you're a chocolate lover, this is for you.  The vanilla bean was subtle and really delicious.  It wasn't overly rich and slightly smaller than the others but there was plenty and it  didn't leave you feeling like you'd over indulged.  The plain cheesecake w/strawberry was great, too.  Exactly what you expect in a classic. The cheesecake factory certainly doesn't skimp on portion sizes but if the food is bland and tasteless, who cares how much they give you.  We havet to go boxes in the fridge because I figure I can doctor it up and make it tasty. The truth is it will probably sit in the fridge until I finally toss it out. I'd go again for drinks and dessert but I'd have dinner somewhere else and if a friendly, hospitable, upbeat wait staff is important to you, skip this place altogether.  Lots of places make good cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-3?start=220,2.52,3.18,3.18,2.6640000000000006,2.9160000000000004

251,Gabby G.,"Acworth, GA",2,132,118.0,3.0,2014-08-23,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory at the Cumberland Mall to enjoy our anniversary lunch date while our kids were in school. We always get good service and great meals here so this was a no brainer, or so we thought. We're very familiar with the Cheesecake Factory menu and had an idea of what we wanted before even arriving.  The very young maître tried to seat us in ""singles-row"" where there wasn't even any other customers sitting there yet, but booths were open?  Hum. So my wife said, ""no"". I asked for a booth, so she continued on to an open booth. Problem solved.    We were already gazing at their ridiculously large, and bad layout of a menu when our server showed up. She told us about their new daily lunch specials, not, the average price was $15 - HUH?  $15 and up for a special?  Anyway, I went right into ordering our favorite appetizer, their Crispy Crab Wontons, plus waters, and a Stella Artois draft. The waters came. The crab wontons came. My Stella? Apparently there was an issue with the tap, as our server stated. After a 10+ minute delay, I stopped our server and started asking for a different beer when a manager came over with my Stella in hand, apologizing for the delay. No harm, no foul, as it was a cold Stella draft. Crisis diverted. Now it was time to order our meals. My wife opted for their Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club and I the Chargrilled Coulotte Steak which is a fancy way to say sirloin steak, medium-rare, no fries, rather spinach. The server repeated the order, shifted to walk away, then turned back and said, ""medium on the steak?""; I quickly replied, ""NO, medium-rare"".  The Crispy Crab Wontons were excellent as always. My wife's Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club came, and then a 2 minute delay then my sirloin steak arrived. As soon as the server placed my steak plate in-front of me I was concerned as my steak looked over cooked, well charred in-fact. The server didn't ask me to cut into it, nor waited, she was off - note, it was lunch and they were getting busier by the minute. I immediately cut into the ""medium-well, to well done"" cooked steak. Looked at my wife and sighed. I got up, found the server and explained the issue. She took the crispy critter away. A few moments past, and a different manager came over to apologize again, this time for the steak, he would make everything right, yada-yada. Typical manager spiel. OK. Fine.  My wife, a slow eater (true honey), was done with half of her massively huge, incredibly tasty sandwich and would be taking the other half home. Me? The spinach was excellent and I gobbled it up. Steak?  What steak. My steak never came and we were at the hour-twenty mark. I was done. I had enough fun for the day. This wasn't going to happen for me. I got up, found our server and said, ""I'm done. The steak never came. She looked shocked and gasped ""what?"" I stated, ""never came, I want the check. OK?"" She apologized, removed the $18 steak off our bill and handed me the check. I paid the $36 balance and that was that. What's curious, no other manager came to our table. After the hour mark they definitely should of showed up with more spiel but nothing. Live and learn.  I have to state I usually get the Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club  or Classic Burger and both are always outstanding. Lessons learned - I should not have ordered a steak and can not recommend a steak at this Cheesecake Factory location. I have to add there was discontent within the server staff at this location; things I overheard that I clearly didn't need to hear. The overall service is slipping into a spiral at this location.  Will we go back to this Cheesecake Factory location? Time will tell. This location is clearly not managed very well anymore, and is not like the Cheesecake Factory of old. We're going to try Maggiano's Little Italy next to the Cheesecake Factory on our next visit to the area.

Obviously we ordered cheesecake afterwards, Ryan got the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake and I got the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake, both were mighty delicious and creamy, enjoyed them completely. In my opinion we should have gotten a discount for getting part of the order wrong, or at least charge us the price for the sun dried tomatoes which is cheaper the fettuccini alfredo, but they charged us full price, that is the only reason I'm giving four starts instead of five, other than that, we had a great experience all around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-3?start=120,2.68,3.13,3.13,3.024,2.9499999999999997

Well, I didn't get peanuts or cashews...I got pecans. And there was no avocado at all which is a complete brainteaser considering the word ""avocado"" is in the name of the dish on the menu.  Also, I'm not sure which restaurant can lay claim to being the first but this salad is very, very similar to the Thai Chicken Salad at J. Alexander's...the chicken is even sliced in the same super-thin, length-wise manner. And considering the one at J.Alexander's is far superior to this salad in just about every way (flavor, texture, value, etc.), this salad felt like a knockoff.  The avocado misstep normally wouldn't deserve one less star but since it's in the name of the dish itself I couldn't look past it. Not remembering the peanut switch request also wouldn't normally be such a bad thing but I got neither what is normally on the dish (cashews) nor what I asked for (peanuts). Therefore, that was worth an entire star, too. Two big mistakes on the same day made me miss the J.Alexander's version even more. It's never good when a dish reminds you of a competing restaurant.

If you are in the mood for sweets, may I suggest venturing out of their cheesecakes and try any of their chocolate cakes?? they are huge and decadent so I suggest to have at least 2 people work on that baby ... maybe even 4 people for every slice ... SERIOUSLY!! Now i forgot the name of the cake I had the last time, but it had three different layers of chocolate with all kinds of other chocolate stuff around it. Now, make sure you have a reservation and patience during their peak hours, cuz the wait can be long.  I definitely enjoy their free bread and soft butter/margarine while you wait for your ordered meal. They have white and wheat bread to choose from. The only thing about this is that you need to sorta kinda control yourself because it is unlimited and it is so easy to fill up on these things before your actual meal comes.  Most of their pasta dishes are huge and can be split with two people. So, unless you are just hell-bent on devouring some food that day, i would say that splitting one pasta entree between two people is the perfect portion per person. We always have the chicken scampi, and it is always on point.  I do not suggest their miso salmon on rice - if you are familiar with what actual miso really is ... It is nowhere near the Japanese miso that we envisioned ... it was more like teriyaki salmon. Eek.  Their meal easily range from $12-30 so it is really up to you how to make the most out of your money and meal. They have a HUGE selection on food and prices really varies due to this.

With plenty of menu options and delicious cheesecake, you just can't go wrong.  Plus the bonus was that you usually can find a Cheesecake Factory next to your neighborhood mall so it was quite convenient.  Not much has changed since then because this location and its sister locations are all within the major malls as well.   I've somehow managed to avoid dining at this chain for most of my 20s but have recently started going back for casual lunches and dinners. Mainly, because of the delicious cheesecake we pick up for dessert.  This location is in Cumberland Mall.  You can't miss them because they are located near Ted's Montana Grill.  Service is excellent the handful of times we have visited so far and of course the cheesecake is always delicious. During our last lunch visit however, they served me a slightly frozen slice of my favorite ""Wild blueberry White Chocolate."" It wasn't a huge deal for me because it was still delicious but I can see how others might be peeved by it.  My boyfriend ordered the ""Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel"" and he enjoyed very bite.  If you love apple pie, you're going to love this cheesecake.   During our last visit, we were both craving burgers so he ordered the Mac n Cheese burger and I ordered the Factory Burger.  The Mac N Cheese is exactly what you think it would be. Picture a juicy burger with includes a mac n cheese patty.  He loved it and was very pleased with his menu choice. I also enjoyed my burger. I was drawn to the wheat bun and the fact that it came with caramelized onions. It's the same wheat bread that you are typically served while you wait for your entrees.  The meat was cooked well and we both left satisfied. NOTE: Our server gave us a heads up that at this particular location, they tend to under cook their meat so if you generally order ""medium"" then your best bet is to order ""medium well"" and so on.   I'm sure we'll return soon enough for more cheesecake slices and explore other menu items.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-3?start=40,3.08,3.14,3.14,2.8960000000000004,3.1160000000000005

Since the aisles are so narrow, we had to put the baby's stroller near the narrow-door entrance, not the main entrance.  I ordered the fish tacos. They were devine. The first two were so good. You know how something has such a distinct taste that after awhile, your taste buds get over them quickly? No? Okay, maybe it's just me. After the first two, I was asking for a taste of my partner's Shepard's Pie, which was SOOO good. I almost wished I'd ordered that. Maybe I will next time. The fish tacos had a nice seasoning, helping of guacamole, and a sweet sauce. Loved it. Just got tired of the taste after the first couple.  I also ordered the Apple Crisp instead of cheesecake, since I'm not a cheesecake fan. Well, this place is called the Cheesecake Factory, so perhaps, I should have tried out one of 'em. The Apple Crisp was disappointing. I'm not a fan of nuts, so the fact that the entire bottom of the dessert was a layer of pecans was disappointing. I totally missed that part on the menu.

Our Chicken Costelleto was cold...the chicken...the asparagus...and the sauce. The only thing hot was the mashed potatoes. The manager said the sauce was supposed to be room temp. No sir...bullcrap! We asked our waitress to make sure our sauce was hot. It still came out cold!!! The kitchen at this location is a constant disappointment and I say Im going to give it another try. NEVER AGAIN! Sad that management wants to use the excuse that the sauce is supposed to be room temp. What a bunch of crap!! Obviously the manager has better things to do then care about his customer base.

My first time going to Cheesecake Factory was not so great so my hubby and I went back for Valentines Day and this time we took the kids. We had to wait 2 hours for a table which we were ok with.  Our problem was the food...again. This time I ordered the shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta and it was just ok. It was very bland and I kept complaining to my husband that I didn't taste or even see any chunks of garlic. Anything with the name scampi you assume would have a very garlicy taste. It came with 6 nice sized shrimp, a small portion of pasta and a small slather of sauce for almost $20.  My son had the kids spaghetti and meatball (yes one meatball not big enough to suffice) and was served 3 times more pasta than what I had on my plate with even less sauce. It was very dry and also very bland and he didn't want to eat it so I gave him my plate and I ate his...ugh is all I can say to describe the taste.  My other son had the kids chicken quesadilla and loved it, although you really can't much mess up a quesadilla.  My daughter had the kids sliders which she didn't like, but love the mixed fruit she ordered with it.  My oldest son and his friend ordered the kids chicken tenders which turned out to be more the size of nuggets. They liked them but not the fries.  My husband had the chicken alfredo which he liked but said there was nothing extravagant about for $20. My homemade seafood alfredo is better.  No one liked the sweet tea but my ultimate margarita was nice. All in all we won't be wasting any more money at the Cheesecake Factory.

The dropped the ball in every other area. I ordered the salmon and it was extremely bland. It definitely needs some more flavoring. I used my whole lemon to try and vamp it up some. The mashed potatoes were really good. The bread was extremely hard and not warm. I like my bread soft and warm and not crunchy like a potato chip! ;/  My date got the parm. chicken and it looked really good.

After telling her it was my very first time here, she never even acknowledged the fact, much less welcomed me as a new guest.

First of all this location is ALWAYS crowded.  One of the main reasons I hate coming here.  But it wasn't my choice, so I was a good little soldier and didn't complain. At first.  Now it's not necessarily their fault that they're a popular franchise in a high-traffic location, but if they managed it better it could possibly work.  We had a large party, so I figured that our friend had made some sort of reservation. Well. It turns out that The Cheesecake Factory doesn't DO reservations. I know, crazy right? I had no idea either!  So we were forced to wait. And wait.  For more than two and a half hours until they could accommodate us.  In the meantime, we watched smaller party after smaller party get seated ahead of us and proceed to occupy tables LONG after they were finished eating their meals.  And once we were finally seated, we still weren't all seated together.  Sigh.  Oh well, on to the food... The long wait meant that we didn't get served until after 10pm. Way too late for my over-40 butt to be eating anything spicy. Regardless, I ordered the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo.  A few measly shrimp, bland broth and some chewy, gristle-y chicken.  I thought the late meal time was the reason I started feeling nauseated a few bites in, so I stopped eating and asked for a to-go box so I could order what I really came for: Oreo Cheesecake.  It was great.   One thing The Cheesecake Factory never gets wrong is, well, cheesecake.

One Sunday I had a gift card and decided to sit at the bar and order. I ordered the Chicken Madeira, the bartender said it was the most popular chicken dish. It also indicated that in the menu. I also ordered the special house made lemonade. I believe there are no free refills on that so sip slowly although that was a struggle (it's reallly good lemonade). I'm not sure why the chicken madeira is the menu favorite, it wasn't over the moon good. In fact, I won't order it the next time I eat here. It was ok, mostly the sauce made the dish. The dish consists of sauteed chicken breast topped with fresh asparagus and melted mozzarella cheese, covered with fresh mushroom madeira sauce. Served with mashed potatoes. I don't know what madeira sauce is but it's similar to carbonara sauce. I believe it's a wine based sauce. Anywhoo, the chicken was a little rubbery for me. The melted cheese on top gave it a tangy flavor which would have been excellent if the cheese was actually melted all the way. The asparagus was amazing and so were the potatoes. But I found myself picking through the chicken to find good pieces. Maybe I just had a bad batch. I also ordered the Salted Caramel Cheesecake to go. It was really really tasty, but nothing beats the red velvet I'm sorry. It took me 3 days to eat that one piece of cheesecake though so maybe I wasn't really feeling it.

Where in Chicago same dish consists of 6 pieces of steak and 6 pieces of shrimps . Seats were uncomfortable to. Well it was just a one day visit to Atlanta so no more worries,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-3?start=120,2.88,3.12,3.12,2.248,3.0240000000000005
124,Yeeli C.,"Powder Springs, GA",0,4,,4.0,2016-07-11,"After 9 days on the road, driving cross country from AZ to GA, we arrived at our hotel on my birthday. :) After getting settled in, we thought Cheesecake Factory sounded awesome. Since this location is close by our hotel, we head over at about 5pm. With 2 young children in tow, we always try to beat the crowd and make breakfast, lunch and dinner just a little earlier when eating out.  We got there slightly past 5pm, was seated immediately with no wait. I told the hostess to put us in a booth or table, preferable away from everyone else, as my 2.5yo can be quite ""distracting"" and likes to play with others who seats around us. I mean, it can be cute when a 2.5yo plays peek-a-boo with you from behind a booth. But after about 5 mins or so, it gets bored quickly... ;p We were seated at a booth along the glass windows next to their patio seatings. It was perfect! I think we were the only table there at that moment, but our server came quickly to take our drink orders. Warm bread were brought to the table shortly after, drinks, and then dinner is served.  I ordered the shrimp and sausage with pasta. It is in a red sauce with a little spice to it from the sausages. Wish there were more shrimps in the dish though, but it was pretty good. Leftover was even better the next day.  hubby ordered chicken Alfredo, the sauce was rich and creamy. Leftover for this dish, however, was not that great the next day because there were not enough Alfredo sauce in the togo box. Think our server might have missed some sauce when she packed up our leftover. The kids ordered from their kids' menu -- pizza and chicken quesadilla. They were amazing!! Portion was quite big, but we don't really mind as we adults were eating of the kids' plates. ha! And yes, there were leftover from these too. And they were great the next day. And we can't leave without having some dessert. I got the oreo cheesecake, and the boys shared something with a lot of chocolate on it. And the waitstaff sang happy birthday to me. I can tell that aside from our server, who was GREAT and AWESOME, the other 2 staff members were not too excited about singing me my birthday song. They sang with minimal expression on their face and left immediately after the last note. Well.... I was not expecting it, so I was not too disappointed by it either. :) Our server was great though. I wish I remember her name. She is petite, in her 20s, African American, with a great smile! Service was great, our server was great.

You could tell our waitress was having a bad day but we made sure we smiled and was friendly but to no avail she just didn't care about us! So now here comes the fun part, food showed up one meal at a time 6 to 8 minutes apart, 4 of us getting our meals 20+minutes apart. I ordered chicken pasta and my meal had 3 pieces of chicken the size of dimes. I asked the waitress if this was correct and she said I don't know and walked off. So I reached out to another person walking by and they said they would carry it back. This time when the food came back 30 minutes later after everyone else had already finished the manager said nothing , not I'm sorry not have a nice day, not even enjoy.

Due to their long wait times we always order for carry out. In the past we've spent 10-15 minutes in line just to pick up the order but figure it's better than waiting 2 hours for a table. Tonight I placed an order well before 7:00 and asked that it be ready by 8:00-I figured an hour plus was plenty of time to assemble some salads and cheesecake. My husband got there at quarter to 8 and there were no less than 30 people (he counted) standing to either place or pick up an order. In 25 minutes the line hadn't moved. He asked the hostess and was basically advised ""oh well-you have to wait"". What is the point of ordering ahead? Why in 25 minutes had the line not moved? When he asked to speak to a manager and asked if maybe there was a need for more help the manager's reply was ""sorry-we're just busy"" How do you wait in line to PICK UP food and there is no movement for almost a half hour?Especially when you have more than an hours lead time.

She came back and checked on us and told us that was our waiter that brought the waters of table and we were shocked... He had a big attitude from some reason and didn't bother speaking... That ticked me off but I just carried on, then I was about to eat my bread and the plate was noticeably dirty, I saw a man walking by in a suit so I figured it was management. I asked for replacement and he then bought me another dirty wet plate, as if he just rinsed it off!!! That pretty much did it for me...

190,William C.,"Smyrna, GA",0,2,,1.0,2016-10-16,"Me and my party arrived and put our name on the wait list. We waited right next to the podium. The first call for our table was heard ""Last call for ... party."" The first call was already the ""last call."" We are seated and minutes later we order our meal. We are seated by 1:12 pm. I order the white chicken chili. It's a meal I've had before at the Cheesecake Factory and like the name states it is supposed to be a white chili, which is a basic (not acidic) dish. What comes out is a tomato-based acidic chili with a few white beans tossed in. When I informed the waitress of the significant difference between the first time I had ordered the same dish and the current time, it was offered to replace the dish. Who I can only assume was the supervisor came over, introductions were not made, and when it was explained that due to reflux I was not able to eat the acidic dish which had, in previous experience, been basic and was described as and commonly is basic, it was stated by the supervisor that it is a white chicken chili because there are white beans in it, though she seconded the offer to replace the meal. No additional requests had been made after the initial offer and acceptance by myself or the rest of my party. I ordered the Factory Meatloaf instead. It was then 1:43pm.  At 2:20pm, the meatloaf dish arrived, my party long since finished eating. It initially looked fine, but due to the previous issue and the long wait time for what is typically a pre-prepared and simple dish, I took a closer look at meal, particularly the meat which was covered in onions and gravy, which was not unexpected. Upon review, the bottom of the first piece was burnt black on the edges encroaching toward the middle, but, after waiting so long, I wasn't inclined to send it back or complain for what was still largely an edible dish. I checked the second piece, and the entire bottom was blackened to the point that my fork could not pierce it. Over an hour had been spent waiting for food, and without a desire to wait another 40 minutes for a meal and have my party wait further,  and with the lack of desire to trust a request for a third meal without tampering, we opted to leave, a second chance already having been given. The item itself was removed from the bill, but no offer of recompense was made for the wasted time or for the poor experience, including lack of offer for the bill itself being cleared (party having only consisted of myself and one other). These days it seems like quality of service is in decline and you are only offered compensation if a scene is made. Decorum and fair exchange of goods is a thing of the past, as certainly my and my parties time and experience did not equate to the monetary value required in relation to the services and goods received. At this time, I do not intend to return to this location of The Cheesecake Factory. The waitresses service was adequate, and she was still tipped, as she did not do any wrongdoing herself and therefore should not pay for the poor experience. My problem is with the establishment itself and with the quality of the food, the chefs, the length of time for service in receipt of the food, and the amelioration of the situation. Certainly, if the food had not been burnt and overcooked, it would have arrived quicker, killing two birds with one stone. Over an hour passed, an hour wasted, and I'm left to seek another establishment for nourishment. Unfortunately, this time, Wendy's proved better and more reliable fare.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-3?start=180,2.52,2.94,2.94,1.924,2.7720000000000002

Now we have eaten at different Cheesecake Factory locations for years. This was by far the worse location we have ever visited.

Not knocking them but The Cheesecake Factory is the on the next level. I've been here and many locations of the chain but never reviewed any of them. So with today's lunch being sponsored by my company, I thought I would share my indulgence.  I am tracking my calories so I am so glad they have the Skinnylicious menu. It offers a ton of items that are still tasty but the calories are cut and listed. Compare this to the regular book menu the restaurant offers. I'm pretty sure a dish averages 15,000 calories overall, and that's being generous. I ordered the Lemon-Garlic Shrimp with angel hair pasta. I never really eat pasta dishes because it is so high in fat and calories but this was a great chance to take advantage. I had about 6 large shrimp in my dish with a red and green sauce. It was good to taste.  I also had a few tortilla chips dipped in spinach and artichoke. It was kinda of bland to taste but I preferred that to salty. Of course the hot bread was delivered. Our service was pretty solid. Brandy started not to check on as much towards the end but her and other staff members kept our water glasses full. I think I took 2 sips and put my glass down and she was refilling. No complaints from me.  How could I leave without trying a piece of cheesecake. My boss recommended the Mango Key Lime Coconut in which I had a 1/4 of it. Wow, it was rich. I don't think coconut is mentioned in the name of the cake so it was a bit of a surprise. The consistency was so thick and rich it seemed like a sherbet or ice cream with graham cracker crust.

Try this:  order carry out, walk to the pick up section in the back, and see how many people  walk right by you avoiding eye contact , and see how long you can go without anyone asking how they could help, if you have been helped, etc.  The only way to get your order is to literally wave your hand and desperately try to make eye contact with someone, and then when you ask who can help with your to go order, they often shrug and say, ""some lady does that stuff, but I have no idea what her name is.""   Even the so-called managers look visibly stressed and see you as someone who is just making them work harder. They are EXPERTS at avoiding eye contact and ignoring guests.  I can sense tension in the team, the coworkers don't like one another, and disdain their managers.   And it reflects in how they treat their customers.  Ultimately disrespectful for an establishment that is in the business of serving people.   No one knows who does what, no on takes ownership, and absolutely no one cares about customers when you walk in as a carry out guest.

This particular one is located/attached to the Cumberland Shopping Mall along with other restaurants. Parking is found in the lots surrounding the mall or the valet service. Every time I have came here it takes a while to find an open space; however if you are getting your food to-go there is one to two spaces to park at for 15mins to pick up your food. The wait time can rage between 15 mins and 45mins, just depends on day and time. Weekends are extremely pack and during the week not so much. The bar area is available as well for faster seating but once again it tend to be filled up. My favorite appetizer that I highly recommend is the fried macaroni and cheese balls---delicious and needed before the meal. My whole family loves them since I introduced them to it. I tend to order the shrimp and chicken gumbo paired with brown rice and maybe a daiquiri. The presentation of this dish is beautiful and the flavors and  taste just the same if not better. I highly recommend this dish and it will fill you up with leftovers to take home as well. If possible please leave room for dessert or take it to-go. I cannot visit any location without ordering one of the cheesecakes. I have personally tried and loved the following kinds: Red velvet, Original Strawberry, Chocolate lover, and Oreo.

And despite having a Cheesecake Factory 20 miles from my house, I decided instead to travel 2,000 miles to try it for the first time.  I might have make that shorter trek sooner or later. Ordered mini crab cakes, Chicken Riesling, a slice of Cheesecake, soda, and a Gin & Tonic. This entire thing, tip included, came out to about 45 dollars. Normal folks who don't need all of that will naturally pay less. The drink came in a rather large glass, far bigger than most places I've been to. I ordered a Hendricks & Tonic, which is a more premium Gin, but I was surprised that given the size of the drink it was only around 9 dollars. I had honestly expected it to be more.  The crab cakes weren't bad, but slightly burnt. Without prompting, inquiry, or concern for this though, the chef had another order of crab cakes brought out to me pre-empting any concern. While I didn't take it, that is... actually a hell of a thing to do. Even when a touch burnt and not completely uniform in size, it was pretty solid.  The Chicken Riesling is a mix of chicken, bacon, onions, and a creamy sauce with pasta. To me, that hits basically all my happy notes. I don't know if it does for you.  Their cheesecake is also pretty solid, and the Sour Cream top works well for it, although I'm not really a huge sour cream fan. I would probably have given this four stars, but the fifth star comes from the chef caring enough to actually pre-empt any concern of mine and deliver another appetizer that didn't meet their own standard.

Finally a server showed up took our drink orders and left. Another server dropped off our drinks and I had to stop a random server 5 minutes later to POLITELY ask for waters that we asked for along with our wine and bread. She was so rude and responded ""what do ya need?"" with a nasty face on. Our server finally brought waters and bread and took our orders. WE SAT THERE FOR 45 MINUTES WAITING FOR OUR FOOD WITH NO SERVER CHECKING ON US. Everyone around us who came in after had already finished dinner. Manager finally brought our food out after the server spoke to him, he was probably too embarrassed.

Once the food arrived I immediately realized the mistake.  I apologized to the waitteress and she said it wasn't a problem and she would call the manager over and replace it with the one I wanted. She was very nice about the situation.  I hate that I forgot her name.   Once the manager came over he wasn't very happy at all and I could tell that he was irritated ( I forgot his name). Once he displayed his frustration I was no longer interested in having my meal replaced.  As I was preparing to pay for the drinks and appetizer the waitress comes back and I tell her we are just gonna skip dinner because the manager wasn't happy and I wasn't comfortable ordering another dish. She told me that she would get the general manager.  His name is Alex.  OMG ALEX...he came over tapped me on the back of my hand and told me shame on me in a very playful manner lol.  He was very friendly nice and understanding.  He said that it was no problem and I felt comfortable ordering our dishes.  Not only was ALEX a sweetheart, he was also very handsome.  IJS.  Thank you Alex you were awesome and you rock.  I appreciate you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-3?start=20,2.96,2.68,2.988,,2.7920000000000003

2,Joy B.,"Atlanta, GA",1,35,33.0,2.0,2017-10-01,"Update: I visited The Cheesecake Factory for lunch and the service was horrible. I'd never seen it so disorganized and a server that was so uninterested in serving the diners. He was dry from the moment I arrived and ended the visit by not speaking to me. It was very unprofessional. He would take forever to come to the table and when he did I asked for condiments. He responded by saying ""Is that it?"" And proceeded to walk away. About 10 minutes later when he returned he didn't have everything. I was growing impatient. So I asked for a Caesar Salad Togo because I never got the condiments I'd asked for. He said he would bring me a Togo box. Everyone knows you can't take a salad with dressing on it to go. It withers. I asked the manager as she was visiting the table next to me about the salad. Side note: They were on their second steak that was prepared incorrectly. The next time I saw the server he just dropped my Togo salad and ticket on the table. He didn't speak. He just walked off with his head turned away from me. For a $20 sandwich and salad, they need to hire more carefully.  Also, my table (or the neighboring tables) was never cleaned off. My drink was empty. I went through 3 sets of silverware to get a clean fork and knife.  Previous rating: 4 I visited this location multiple times. The good thing about it is that the food is pretty consistent. The bad part is the menu is so big and diverse and can be hard to decide. The large menu probably contributes to the taste of the food. They don't have a good specialty. So some items can be extremely bland for the price. I have a couple of items I eat every time I visit and those are great. I LOVE THE CLUB and CEASAR SALAD. It's great. They also had a shrimp club and crab cake sandwich that were delicious. They also have good drinks at the bar.  The service is good (dine-in and take-out). There can be a long wait and parking can be an issue depending on the day/time. I personally just park in the mall parking deck and walk through the mall to the restaurant. They could step up cleanliness. I've sat at tables with crumbs or received bread plates with crumbs. Overall, I would recommend this location, just know what you want before you arrive and stay away from the bland pasta.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-3,2.76,2.68,2.956,,2.712

I'd give it 5 stars if the food were actually great, but it's just a mediocre stomach filler. I've never WANTED any food from here. Just the cheesecake that the place is named for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-3,3.16,2.72,2.952,,2.8960000000000004

My sister in law is in town so we decided to drive over and the experience was mostly terrible. The food took forever, they got our order wrong, we ordered the Chicken Romano and it had the wrong sauce on it so they offered to replace it, which was nice but it took another 25 minutes for them to replace our food and the manager was extremely rude about it. The ONLY saving grace for this particular Cheesecake was our waitress Leni Andro, she was amazing!! She was apologetic, very sweet, and she personally paid for a mistake the kitchen made at another table, out of her own pocket. This girl loves her job and Cheesecake is lucky to have her, especially this branch! She could teach the manager a thing or two.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-3,3.04,2.71,2.94,,2.8420000000000005
