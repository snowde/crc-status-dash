GASP .. no Thai Chicken Pasta. :(  My heart was broken by the lack of my favorite lunch item, but my server suggested the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, which was awesome. In fact, you could hold the shrimp and hold the chicken and just give me the sauce over rice and I'd be happy. Especially with the wheat bread to dip in it.

We had to wait minutes for the slice of Pineapple Upside Down Cheese cake and slice of Blackout Cake we ordered. I checked the order and the sliver of cheesecake was about the same size as the to-go fork they gave us. There was a line by this time so I didn't bother to say anything to them and would just have to deal with it (such a scam). What the heck is with this bait and switch Cheesecake Factory pulls with to-go desserts??!! Come on! When one is paying nearly $8 for a slice of cake it better be worth $8 bucks, especially when I know I could get an ENTIRE cheesecake for $8 else where, yeah it's called Publix bakery.

62,Cindy A.,"Marietta, GA",59,168,138.0,5.0,2014-06-21,Cheesecake Factory is one of our favorites. The new location at Lenox is really nice. The decor is appealing and the wait staff is very competent and attentive. The bread is so good to start with. I had the teriyaki chicken and my husband has the chicken and biscuits. Both were delicious and had enough to take home for lunch. Then there was dessert. OMG- the cheesecake variety choices. Not a bad one in the bunch!  We shared the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake.

However, the hosts were very welcoming. For the most part the food was good. The crab wontons were very good and the bread (as always) was good. I ordered the garlic noodles with shrimp added, which costs an additional 4 or so dollars. I was a little disappointed that I only got 4 and they were a bit overcooked.

The buzzer buzzed some time ago, we handed the buzzer to the hostess. She took the buzzer from us, did not say a word and turned away from us. We are clueless, not sure when we are getting our table. Finally someone called one of my friend's name, we followed her just to be told to wait again as table was not ready. No apologies, nothing. Yup, we are the dumb people who chose to come here and being snubbed by this 5 star fancy restaurant. We deserve to be treated badly! Seriously??? The lack of basic customer service among the hostess(es) was appalling. Why are these incompetent people even here?? Yes, the place was busy, people kept coming in and the inadequate of proper place to accommodate those who were waiting for a table. But that is no excuse to be rude and snooty. By the way, whoever designed this place is a joke. People were standing in front and everywhere simply because there is no designated area for them to wait for their table. More waiting... Finally.. Our table is ready.. (To be continued) ... It's 10pm now, just got home..  Continuing from earlier... After almost 2 hours, my friends got their food. Shortly, a gentleman came to our table (whom I  believed to be the manager) started apologizing, letting me know the fish & chips I ordered has gone missing. He said he has already asked the kitchen to redo the fish & chips and it would be out shortly in a minute or two. I felt a lot better even though my fish & chips has gone AWOL, at least someone came and informed me and apologized for the wait. Our server, David, who has been very nice all these while also came and apologized about the long wait for the food.  Based on that only, I have gone ahead and amended my review draft from a 1 star to 3 stars.  Food was good but I supposed a piece of bread will be just as tasty. I was starving since like about 3 hours ago. At the end of the night, the check came and David told me they have taken off the fish & chips. I thanked him for that, took care of the bill and off we left. We lived like a couple of minutes away from the mall. By the time I got back home, it was like 10pm.  It was a disaster to come here for dinner. Guess the manager and our server managed to save this place by helping to bump this review from a 1 to 3 stars.  Phew!!

12,Samantha H.,"Atlanta, GA",1,14,,2.0,2014-07-13,"I came here for lunch with a friend and was highly disappointed.  I ordered the lunch salmon special and it was very bland. My friend ordered a soup, salad, and sandwich combo and the bread was as hard as a rock (literally), the soup looked like pancake batter, and her salad was very sloppy.   Since I never complain I barely ate my food but paid for my meal anyway with no complaints. My friend advised our server that she didn't like her meal and ordered something else that was also badly plated and poorly seasoned. The worst of it all was really the service.  I think our servers name was Jaylene.  Apparently, during our dining experience, Jaylene was getting off and the next shift was starting so she asked us 6 times (we counted) if we wanted dessert.  Once before I even ordered my meal (my friend arrived before I did).  My friend eventually asked her if she was getting off and offered to pay our tab.  It's in bad taste to be rushed out of the door at 3pm in the afternoon.

Outside of ordering takeout cheesecakes, I usually go to the Cheesecake Factory with groups of people, mainly because of the varied menu and the ease of accommodation. I've never had any problems until now. I planned to visit today with a group of 11 and was thoroughly turned off by the service I received. I called in to inquire about a reservation and was met with a rude hostess on the other end.  She tartly told me they don't take reservations and they don't accommodate large groups well. That was news to me since Cheesecake Factory's own website, specifically the details section for the Lenox location says ""We can easily accomodate large parties."" She also said we'd have to wait two hours. As I was saying, ""Ah OK, thanks,"" she simply hung up the call. Wow, really? I planned to call the manager, but didn't want to be put on hold for an obscene amount of time. Instead, I'm calling corporate about the sorry service.  **Manager's take note: Service is still a priority for many patrons.

57,Joey R.,"Atlanta, GA",74,68,115.0,3.0,2014-07-30,"I love the new location.  It's much more convenient to access.  They also have curbside takeaway!  They have designated six parking spaces where you can have your food delivered to you after you phone in your order.  The booths are more intimate than all of the seating in the middle.   The manager mentioned that the new restaurant is literally half the size of the previous one (from 500 down to 250) but they have literally doubled the number of people coming in there each day!   On my recent visit the food was consistent as usual.  The tex mex rolls are always great...the sliders and chicken sliders have always been one of my favorites. Their menu is a small novel, so you will always find something....no matter what your mood is.   The biggest downside on my recent visit was the service.  The service is hot and cold here.  This time the server was nowhere to be found for most of the meal.  I kept having to flag down other servers.... The other complaint most people have is that in this day and age, it's hard to go somewhere that doesn't take reservations.  It's so easy to make online reservations at most Atlanta restaurants and not have to wait ...sometimes it's hard to justify going anywhere won't accept reservations.  I always recommend calling and finding out how bad the wait is before going to Cheesecake Factory.  I would also recommend staying away on a Saturday  night.  There are hundreds and hundreds of top Atlanta restaurants that are on Opentable and accept online reservations.  Why bother going somewhere on a Sat. night where you might have to wait an hour to be seated??",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-4?start=120,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.892000000000001

177,R N.,"Roswell, GA",0,4,,3.0,2014-08-27,"Good Service!! Cheesecake Factory has always been a bit over rated in my book. It is always overly crowded and never more than a mediocre experience with the food and drinks. Service is normally decent, I have never had an issue (The Original Buckhead Location). Overall it is not truly worth the cost when you combine it with the wait time, which is always outrageous! So this is the relocated location which has moved to Lenox Mall, this is a bummer because going to Lenox is such a hassle in my opinion. We were not aware of the move when we visited recently, or we would have gone elsewhere. We decided to just go anyway. The food was better than usual, not OUT-standing, but pretty good. Drinks were good, & the wait time was fair (because we sat outside and it was fairly warm).

I've had Cheesecake Factory's hot fudge before and was looking forward to it as a topping for my vanilla bean cheesecake. But instead I got a small cup of a thin chocolate sauce that was clearly not hot fudge. I asked the waitress about it, and she said, ""We have two, the pump and the squeeze bottle. Sometimes the pump acts up and they use the squeeze bottle."" She went back to check on getting actual hot fudge, but returned and repeated, ""Yeah, the pump is acting up."" Seems like they could simply take off the pump and scoop out the hot fudge, but either way, substituting what was clearly Hershey's syrup is not a solution. I would have rather she'd told me they didn't have hot fudge so I could order a different flavor cheesecake.

Flagged a manager down and said it has been 15 minutes and still no bread, he said its been baking. Really? It's lunch hour and its baking, for 15 minutes? I don't think so. Our food came out, all was fine and dandy, but no bread. Finally the waitress brought the bread out and it did not even seem fresh. We told the manager that all we wanted was some communication from our waitress. Did not get drink refills, nor did she ask how everything was. She was just terrible, a few other little things I am not going to mention about her attitude, I'm not going to post on here. Had to flag her down for everything. I have been a waiter for quite a while at a few restaurants and I can be patient and understandable about most thing. But if you do not communicate with me and leave me hanging, you will not get my respect or a tip from me. If you are busy, just tell me and I will understand. but don't tell me you will be right back with my girlfriends drink and some bread, then disappear for 15 minutes. Just communicate with me, refill my water, and ask how our meals are. That's all, it's not that hard. Left zero tip, as she did not fulfill a servers basic, I mean real basic duties.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-4?start=200,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.7880000000000003,3.1600000000000006

The menu takes at least 5-7 minutes or more to view from cover to cover.  That's why it's the perfect place to go to if you're just craving a predictable menu with solid service.  Oh, and I'm sure most of you dine here for their dessert menu as well. The last couple of times I was here, I went for a birthday brunch and happy hour.  Our brunch group was over 10 people and the service as stellar. We could not have asked for a better team of servers that took great care of us.  I ordered from their lo-cal menu and got their BBQ chicken salad. Portion size was perfect and my chicken was well cooked.  On another visit, I went to their happy hour on a weeknight with a dear friend, Morgan W., before heading to the YELPmas holiday party and sitting at the bar was quite the experience. Our bartender that night didn't quite understand that waiting 15-20 minutes for a drink order was frustrating because he just assumed his order was being handled by another team member.  Luckily for him, I wasn't in the mood to get i-rate so I just asked one more time for my friend to check on her drink order and that was all it took. My last visit was yesterday and decided to order something complete different.  The Chicken Madeira was calling my name because it came with their infamous mashed potatoes and asparagus. My chicken was cooked well and had this delicious, tangy and sweet sauce that seemed soy sauce based.  I dug it and completed my entire plate. It came with about 2 pieces of chicken breast (grilled) topped with melted mozzarella cheese, sautéed mushrooms, and the grilled asparagus. YUM.  Our server was fantastic. She was on the ball and gave me my extra plate of lemons for my water and tea and made sure that our tea mugs were always half full.  Kudos to our server for taking great care of us on a busy Sunday!!  I look forward to returning for future happy hours during the week since my office is less than 10 minutes away and post shopping lunch and dinners.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-4?start=60,3.04,3.04,3.04,3.4760000000000004,3.0400000000000005

The menu is extensive - I recommend checking it out online if you can before you go, unless you enjoy leisurely considering menu options when you're starving. i enjoyed my Caesar salad and my friend liked her baked chicken which i thnk was accompanied by quinoa and vegetables. The dessert we had later on was the highlight of the day, however. We both had the apple pie a la mode which came with the most diesel dollop of whipped cream on the planet! Each bite was euphoric.

The cheesecake is even better. So many choices, so little time.  Good thing they have a walk up counter for the cheesecake so you don't have to dine in to get some.  I was annoyed at the hostess stand because we had a party of 5 and of course they don't seat until the whole party is there. Fine, those of us who are there are checked in.  But when our party was fully there, we had to wait?

My bf first brought me here one year ago b/c we were in the mood for some dessert after our dinner. I've never been to this establishment before despite it being a commonplace chain. We were seated in one place at first, but we wanted a different seating and got it cuz it wasn't so busy that late night so kudos to the waiter. We told the server that we were only going to get dessert and he still gave us the complimentary bread with butter, which was really tasty and awesome.I actually wished I wanted more but had to hold back cuz I just had dinner and needed room for the cake that were going to order. We got the Tiramisu Cheesecake and Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake (Raspberry-Vanilla Cake, Creamy Lemon Cheesecake, Raspberry Lady Fingers and Lemon Mousse) We both enjoyed the Lemon Raspberry chzcake a lot more than the Tiramisu. The tiramisu wasn't bad, but I think we only found out that we preferred the sweet-citrusy taste over the coffee taste.  For my 2nd visit, we found out that it had moved to Lenox Mall, so of course it was extremely busy. We arrived around 7:15pm, got a ticket that said ETA 75-90 minutes (yikes! used the waiting time to explore the mall). They got our cell phone number to text, which was nice.

First the waiter did not bring the complimentary bread , we ordered Nachos and we asked for the jalapeño to be on the side , the dish came burned and soggy with all the sides on another plate , and it seems like it was leftovers and was reheated . We asked to talk with the waiter since he was busy chatting with another waitress , instead he sent the manager to talk to us . He came and was like what do you want ? We told him that the waiter did not bring the bread and he said it was still in the oven !!! Really 20 minutes and may be over in the oven , we told him about the Nachos he seemed like he does not care , he just shoved the plate and told us that another one will be ready soon ,no apology or nothing !! We were so hungry so we waited , otherwise we would of left at this point . Suddenly the waiter appeared he apologized and asked us if we want to continue our meal or not ?  We told him yes . He brought the bread and the Nachos then came the Fettuccine and the pasta that we ordered , no need to say that the Fettuccine pasta was all broken as if it was the leftovers on the bottom of the pasta box and it was mixed with the other type of pasta that we order , it looks like that they were boiled together !!

When water came out, another guest had ice and water spilled on her by the server. Food finally came out and servers were calling out orders instead of knowing where the food goes, one had to wait an additional 5 minutes for her food. We got checked on once, dessert was ordered while people were eating, and dirty entree plates sat in front of people until dessert came out. One was supposed to be to go and it came on a plate, a few came out frozen.

However this last visit to the Lenox location was HORRIBLE.  My family of six had our family brunch.  We ordered our food and only 4 of us got our food. We thought that the 2 orders would come out.  It turns out one of the meals was not even made, and the other was just sitting on the counter waiting to be delivered to our table. So my brother waited 20 minutes after we had all gotten our food. My sister had to wait an additional 30-40 minutes!!!!  This there our whole day off, and we were late for our next event!! The manager (whichever manager that is present on Sunday afternoon) was not very sympathetic.  He had the audacity to only offer to give us a single slice of free cheesecake as if that would fix everything. Its so sad because he relayed this message through the wait staff instead of coming out to speak to us.  So we immediately asked to speak to the manager. He offered to take one of the late meals off the ticket and give us two slices of cheesecake. But he did so rather unapologetic about the inconvenience that was caused and was rather defensive.   The Cheesecake Factory Lenox location absolutely just lost 6 customers.  We'll take our money where management demonstrates better customer service and treats their patrons like they actually want their return business",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-4?start=120,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.372,2.8

It takes a minute to digest the ""book"" of a menu.  I have appreciated their ability to produce so many different dishes.  My wife wanted a salad and settled on the vegetable chopped salad.  For some reason the chicken piccata caught my eye.  We decided to have the salad out first and split it and then the entree size piccata.   The salad was nice and cold and fresh.  It is so large that splitting it was great.  Quite frankly we could have stopped there.  Nice fresh vegetables and a very nice citrus vinaigrette dressing.  Our server did not rush us and the entree came out at a perfect time and again the size allowed us to split with not problem.  The sauce was very good, not the best I have ever had but very good.  The chicken was tender and not breaded, which is a mistake I see often with piccata.  There was nice amount of capers and a al-dente angel hair pasta.  I also appreciated that there was not too much garlic.

149,Dustin D.,"Sparks, NV",0,1,,1.0,2015-10-28,"This was a sadly poor experience with a large group (14).  From the start we, as a group came in during a slow period in the evening this Wednesday. There were plenty of open tables, yet we stood waiting to be seated for 30 minutes.  The service was exceptionally slow for the traffic this night and the waitress was adamant to let us know early on that it would be ""very difficult"" to split the check as we needed and she preferred to do it in a different manner. Also, later informing us that our checks would take a long time to be dealt with due to the size of the order. It's simple math really. Total in dollars divided by 14. Wow. This is my second time visiting this location this month and my second poor experience, except this time I felt it was necessary to let others know. On this side of Atlanta, you would expect better, quality service. Specifically in the renowned Lenox Square.   To top it all off, the dessert.... You guessed it, cheesecake was also served incorrectly.  Literally, the only reason I came to CHEESECAKE Factory was for the cheese cake. Avoid this location, they couldn't care less about your time or service. Just a sad few experiences for such an ordinarily decent experience.  If you're having a bad day, fine I get it. But you just made over $100+ in tips in one and 1/2 hours. Be grateful you have the opportunity to serve in such a high class area, otherwise you'd probably get stiffed; and that goes for the whole staff. I signed up for Yelp solely to leave this review.

128,Rae Lynne K.,"Brooklyn, NY",175,382,69.0,3.0,2015-11-05,"I've been to this location a couple of times and must say that it remains a solid 3 star visit. The service has been hit or miss, which is the primary reason for the low stars.  Upon check in, the staff always seems in overwhelmed mode, and can be on the rude side. I asked both times to be seated outside. The first visit I was seated right away, the second time I was told there would be a 15 minute wait, and there was very few people seated outside. Now I don't mind waiting, but after 25 minutes, I was still seated inside, after being told that there was no available tables outside. I do like the fact that you can enter your phone number and receive a text message when your table is ready. However, when you receive that text message, be prepared to wait at least another 10 minutes while someone else comes over to help you, or as they stand there looking at you, holding your seating fate in their hands. The location is very nice inside. When I sat outside, we were able to have the heater turned on making for a very comfortable environment. On the inside, the place was extremely loud and the table was cramped. Not to mention the people seated next to me thought it was a good idea to enter my personal space with their chairs. Definitely not the best dining experience as I had to ask the woman twice to move over, as her hair ended up in my food both times. The waitress just kind of shrugged at me after the woman refused to move over, and had I not been an adult, I would have just dumped my dinner on her since her hair was in it anyway.  Now to the food. I've tried the buffalo wings on both occasions, and they are very good. I also tried the fried mac and cheese which was delicious. I like the skinnylicious menu as well. I've tried the cajun jambalaya pasta dish which was delicious, just the perfect amount of spicy, as well as the grilled salmon, although a slight bit overcooked, still moist and delicious. The portions are large, and the pricing fair for what you're getting. Drinks wise, I've tried the pina colada, the tropical martini, and the pineapple mojito, all of which were good on the amount of alcohol and fantastic on flavor.  The best part about the Cheesecake Factory is, and will always be the cheesecake. I always get the red velvet cheesecake as it is my favorite. Save lots of room for the cheesecake, the portion is huge, and extremely filling. This place certainly does cheesecake right.  Now, if only they can get the service improved, the rating would improve. But I'll eat here again for the cheesecake alone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-4?start=100,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.412,2.88

I really hate to only give them 2 stars but this location deserved it. Poor service! So, I went to this location a couple of weekends ago around 3:30pm. We were told it would be an hour wait for a party of two. We ended up waiting almost an hour and a half. But I was excited to show the place off to a newbie so we waited. I've been to other locations - Jacksonville, FL, Miami, FL, Cherry Hill, NJ, and Charlotte, NC. I knew what to expect as far as decor and prices. Yes, they are pretty pricey but it has been worth it at every visit EXCEPT this one. The service was just awful. No other word for it. I had a spicy pasta and had to stop several other waiters for a refill as our waitress literally took our orders and brought the check. I asked her for a refill and she said ok but I saw her walk past several times. The food was so subpar here. The bread they give you was cold and hard. The table next to us had to send their pizza back because the bottom was completely burned and black. The cheesecake never disappoints though. It was great as per usual.

I guess there are so many reviews out there and it is a chain restaurant so what you get is pretty standard wherever you so.

222,Chanel R.,"Atlanta, GA",5,31,121.0,4.0,2016-01-19,"The Cheesecake Factory at Lenox Square Mall is amazing for its ambience. The lightings of the restaurant are dim and yellow, the concept of the restaurant décor is mixed, it can be romantic but also suitable for groups and gatherings. There is a bar too, so the noise level is quite high and not suitable for business meals. The seats at dining area were not very comfortable, the tables are quite small for two especially if you are going to order a lot of food.  I came on a Saturday, the restaurant was crowded, however, not difficult to get a seat. The staffs at the front desk were attentive and they serve you right away when you entered. Few tables were assigned to each waiter/waitress, so he/she will definitely be attentive to serve you. I was quite satisfied with my waitress. At times, she was too busy serving other tables, but she came back to check and apologized.  Before the meals hit the table, I was served with two different kinds of fresh baked breads, brown honey wheat bread and sourdough. The breads were soft and served hot, goes well with butter.  I ordered the Cabonara spaghetti pasta Smoked Bacon, Green Peas, and a Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce and Tortiglioni pasta with meatballs. The portion of the dishes were filling, pastas were cooked well and the taste was quite ok. I would say a 5/10. As for dessert, I ordered a lemon raspberry cream cheesecake. The cheesecake was a little wet and too sweet, too much whipped cream. I was quite disappointed as I was having high hopes on Cheesecake Factory since cheesecakes are their main iconic food. I give it a 4/10. I will still visit again when I crave for dessert, willing to give it another try. The service is great, the ambience is nice, the food was ok, slightly costly.

Cheesecake Factory has always been a part of my Atlanta chain restaurant staples. My first experience at a Cheesecake Factory was at the original Buckhead Cheesecake Factory. The wait on a Friday night was pretty long for 2 people. My sister and I got to the restaurant around 9:30PM and waited for about 25 minutes. We were seated in the back of the restaurant, and were constantly being interrupted by people leaving or entering the restaurant through the mall entrance in the back. We rarely saw our server, but were served our basic needs, albeit at a slow pace. My sister ordered a strawberry lemonade and it was SO sickly sweet. She asked for a free refill, but even my sister, Queen of sugary sweet things, couldn't finish a second glass. She ended up taking a to-go cup.  THAT BROWN BREAD THOUGH. I know it's not pumpernickel, but we trick ourselves into thinking it is so maybe it doesn't seem as unhealthy. Not that using an entire stick of butter on the bread is any better. It took a while to get to us, but once it did, it was soft and warm.  My sister and I split a pasta and an order of calamari. I got tired of the calamari real fast - my sister didn't like it so I ended up eating the whole $12 appetizer order of fried squid. It was just too much. I prefer not to take fried food to go, so I ended up leaving 1/4 of it there. My sister ordered the tomato basil pasta, and it wasn't too bad - just a standard pasta. My sister is a picky eater, and didn't like the pesto drizzle on top - that was NOT listed in the menu. She tried to eat around it, but as the trend goes, I ate most of her meal.

A manager dropped it off and asked if we needed anything else. I told him that we ordered an app and that it hadn't come out yet, but we didn't want it anymore because our entrees were already on the table. He says he will go check on it.... He never returned, go figure... Mind you our server has been walking past our table and didn't realize we didn't have our appetizer... We are halfway through our meal and she runs up saying ""oh let me go check on your appetizer"" I tell her we don't want it anymore and that we are ready for the check. She brings the check and I give her my gift card right away so that we can leave as soon as possible. She gives us back the receipt but decides to keep my gift card.

Get this, there was only one of those Dutch Caramels ordered and a Dulce cheesecake ordered originally, but they sent us two Dutch Caramels; we didn't even request that cheesecake be sent, so some smart person gave $20 away.  If service was like this at their previous location on Peachtree, I'm not surprised people zoomed right by without stopping!  The ambiance of the Lenox Mall location is way too nice for these nasty people-- they need to be replaced and should find jobs away from people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-4?start=120,2.56,3.03,3.03,2.468,2.8419999999999996
237,Victoria B.,"Augusta, GA",4,28,33.0,2.0,2016-02-29,"We went to the Cheesecake Factory restaurant at the Lenox Square Mall yesterday (2/28/16) and I had mixed feelings about the visit, so I decided to give myself 24 hours cool down before writing this review.  First, the Cheesecake Factory is a chain. We have eaten at various other stores and are familiar with their offerings. As usual, have rave reviews for the food and drink. Everything was delicious, well-seasoned and the quality I like to see at restaurants. In addition, our server Brittany was fast, efficient and very pleasant. Cudos all around for her performance. Where this visit went off the rails was at reception. The hostess was nice, but seemed a little frazzled. We were given a 40-minute wait time and instructions on how to respond to the page to my cellphone. Waits at Cheesecake Factory are business as usual, so we took a seat outside. As we waited, I counted 5 empty (dirty) tables waiting to be bussed. The hostess actually cleaned one of the tables when she came to seat guests, but the remaining four were dirty the entire time we watched during our wait. After we were paged and went inside, there was another queue to wait in for a hostess to seat us. Once again, I counted 3 booths and a table (visible from where we were standing) that were dirty and in need of clearing before seating other guests. A number of other guests who had already been paged were lining the walkway and waiting to be seated. (This design created an obstruction to the walkway and a potential hazard.) As we were seated, I noticed that in places the floors were slippery, but this could have been just a spot or two of water spilled on the floors. While we enjoyed our meal, I did notice that a manager was clearing tables, so it's possible this was an isolated incident, but this is the type of thing that spreads ripples through an entire service. Uncleared tables lead to decreased capacity and longer wait times. These in turn poorly flavor the guest experience and affect return visits. Our visit was early (3pm) Sunday afternoon, not during the busiest service at all. All things considered, we're happy with the food, but with other comparable competition, no longer make The Cheesecake Factory a regular dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-4?start=80,2.56,3.01,3.01,2.6960000000000006,2.8299999999999996

Keep in mind I always order the same thing each time I go so I noticed the difference right away. Then when my chicken and biscuits arrived they was luke warm and was not seasoned. My spouse ordered the chicken carbonara which the alfredo sauce was runny like water so we sent it back. Once again we had to ask another waiter to get our waitress and by the time she arrived it is now after 11:00 pm and our original waitress says well the kitchen is now closed. The manager comes over and says let me see if we can get you something else which we ordered a BLT. The BLT comes over and the fries are also luke warm and the manager says he guess they was left over. I never asked for a discount because I pay for what I want so the manager ask me if I wanted a slice of cheesecake and I told him I don't like sweets. He says well I'm trying to offer you a $ 9 cheesecake for a $ 1 fry. Now talk about insult I told him to take the BLT and chicken carbonara off the bill and I wanted corporate's number.

When we got there, it was a long line for indoor seating but only a 5 minute wait for outdoors. We got lucky with that. Their seating are cushioned and not metal hard chairs like other places. The atmosphere was also way more quiet than sitting indoors. The chicken lemon couscous is now my favorite dish there.. it has all the healthy vegetables that I like! Kale, green beans, corn, tomatoes, and much more. However, the creamy mayo like sauce that the couscous was sitting in along with the heavy amount of butter was borderline too much for a dish that I chose because the description made it sound so healthy.

When we ordered cheese cake the waitress remarked ""oh, is this for here?"" Returning to literally throw the plate onto the table without bringing forks or refilling drinks. We asked a team member to speak with a manager, they acted as they were going to get one and then stated bringing out food for another table. The waitress returned and threw the check on the table and waited for the payment to be placed in it as if she was rushing us out - no manager ever showed up.

If you have ever had the Cheesecake Factory the name alone is a three and everything else is just a plus. The only reason I am giving this place a four instead of a perfect is because of the wait time after we were done eating and the time it took for the waiter to come back and provide us with the desert menu. I will say that we came right with they opened so it was very easy to get a seat. Also, I asked the seater for a table and he gave us a booth (I didn't bother to correct him). The variety of food is too much as always. I was switching back and forth between a salad and macaroni burger. I thought it was a little crazy that the salads were almost $20, so I ended up getting a burger. I guess part of the price is the experience. Of course if you come to the Cheesecake Factory you have to get some Cheesecake. Was a little disappointed they didn't have the Khalua available at that time, but no harm no foul. The wait time for the food wasn't long, but again, we came right when it opened.

79,Alicia M.,"Atlanta, GA",0,11,8.0,1.0,2017-02-02,"I had the worse experience ever in life at this place and I frequent here quite often. My fiancé and I decided to go a late night date after been apart for almost two weeks because of work! When we walked in the hostess didn't acknowledge us for about 10 minutes and when she did her response was "" what do you need"" after placing our name on the waiting list we took a seat! The wait wasn't long at all maybe 10 minutes so when we were seated she sat us in the bar area at a table. The waiter ""Justin"" came to the table and introduced himself and brought a basket of bread. While going through what I took as a normal routine of telling any specials and recommendations I stopped him to tell him that the silverware was filthy with food still stuck in between the fork prongs and as I examined further the saucer for the bread had a black/brown food debris in the middle so I showed him that... He never said anything but he aggressively grabbed the silverware, napkins and plates up with rage! He mad such a ruckus that the table of 4 sitting next to us stopped eating to see what was going on... He then proceeded to walk off with an attitude to the hostess stand where about 6-8 employees was standing along the manager (that stated he was new there and had only been there 2 days ,he looked like he was of Spanish decent, from Knoxville, Tennessee so he didn't know all of his employees yet) I took it that he went to vent to them about the situation all while still clutching the dirty dishes in his fist. My fiancé was appalled so he got and proceeded to the hostess stand to find out what was all that about and exchanged words with Justin who then stormed off to the kitchen area. The ""new""manager came over to ask what had happened and we explained the situation but he had no remorse for the situation but only thing he could tell us was that he was new and did we still want to dine in! My fiancé didn't want to eat anymore but I wanted to eat bc it was already late and it would be hard to find another restaurant before closing time. He told us he would get us another waiter which was ""Cooper"", he was totally amazing, but the Mgr never apologized but he did ask us what do you want me to do then, of course my fiancé said fire him but I was realistic about the situation and was he needed to be reprimanded for that and suspended so he can appreciate his job because we as consumers keep him with a job! If we don't come in and eat then he has no job. We moved tables because the scene had blown up so everyone in the area was staring to see what would happen next so we moved to feel a little more at ease. I would have thought the manager would have offered some compensation or remorse but of course he didn't but the waiter Cooper made sure he tried to make the experience pleasurable with his outstanding customer service skills. Our bill ended up being about $167.?? and tipped $30 but at no point were we offered a discount or even a heart felt apology. I will never visit this particular restaurant again because I didn't feel like I was appreciated and even after he horrible experience I still ate, paid and tipped but I had to let it be known what had happened! Justin is a horrible disgusting person that shouldn't be working in anyone establishment with that poor customer service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-4?start=140,3.08,2.85,2.85,2.436,2.942

What particularly impresses me about this place is: First, their menu is really extensive. They have so many options to choose from; from snacks,appetizers to entrees the range of dish and cuisine is commendable. Second, whatever dish corresponding to a cuisine that they offer, is true to it's flavor and toothsome.   They also have a separate brunch menu.  AMBIANCE:  Beautiful decor with large sitting area. classy ambiance with lively energy as the place is usually packed on weekends! FOOD: They serve hot and fresh mini baguettes with butter spread as complementary starters.  Placed the following order for our dinner: Appetizer:  1. Nashville hot chicken nuggets(~$10): juicy chicken nuggets, fried to perfect crispiness smothered in a delectable hot sauce and pickles. Loved it! 2: Chicken Potstickers(~$10): The potstickers were good but what stood out was the sauce! It's very delicious.  Main Dish: 3. Chicken Madeira(~$15): this is their most famous chicken dish which comes as perfectly cooked chicken breasts topped with mozzarella cheese and served with mashed potatoes, asparagus and mushrooms. Tastes good. Portion is huge 4. Jamaican black pepper shrimp & chicken(~$19): this is such a wholesome meal. You could choose either shrimp or chicken or combination of both which I did. Shrimp and chicken pieces in a spicy black pepper sauce served with brown/white rice, black beans, fried plantains and pineapple salsa. Absolutely loved the spicy black pepper sauce and the fried plantains. The portions of food here is huge. Every time I am here, I always have left overs to take away. During my earlier visits, I have tried the stuffed mushrooms, crab cakes, shrimp scampi and chicken marsala; all of them being delicious! Their Cheesecakes which they are famous and known widely for is classic and perfect! I have had Cheesecakes here(carry out) so many times that I cannot even  keep a count of it.  SERVICE: Friendly staff, service is fast and efficient. It could get really busy on weekends so there could be long waiting time. Overall, a great choice to dine when you are in mood for a  three course meal in a fancy yet casual atmosphere. Also a very good option to dine especially when you are not sure what cuisine you want to eat on a particular day, as they offer so many choices here. A dish/cuisine they offer might not be the best in the city but everything is tasty, high quality, true to its flavor and of huge portions.  If you are not in a mood to dine, then it's an ultimate place to have Cheesecakes as carry out from their take away counter.

This is a really nice Cheesecake Factory location.  This CF is located in Lenox Square Mall.  It's in the front main entrance area near Starbucks.  I must say I was disappointed when they shut down the original Buckhead CF location a couple of years ago; however, they did this new location nice!  It's not two stories like the old location but this spot is bright, open, and very spacious.  I dig the layout.  Love the signature yellow tone colors with the cool light fixtures on the high ceiling and the new modern addition of mosaic artwork behind the bar.  That mosaic artwork is so pretty!!  The bathrooms a little far off if you're sitting at the tables near the bar but it did allow me to see all the cool details of this place.   Service was good.  Hostess was friendly, prompt, and helpful.  Our server made sure we had everything we needed and checked up on his throughout our meal. The lettuce wraps was a very nice generous portion and had beautiful plating.  We also ordered the Da Vinci pasta, jambalaya pasta, and Madeira chicken.  Everything was pretty cooked well and you know, Cheesecake Factory does NOT play with their portions.  They are very generous in the portions for all their main entrees.  Always enough for you to take some leftovers home.  The Da Vinci pasta didn't have enough sauce on it but did like how generous the portion was.  The mashed potatoes on the Chicken Madeira is sooooo good! We opted out of the desserts this time but their cheesecakes are pretty amazing.  Actually...they are really amazing.  They have a huge variety available as well every time.

I got home & it was still 100% frozen (like their other pre-made chain food). Why the heck make me wait almost an hour just to go up to the freezer & pull out a frozen cheesecake. When I discovered this at home I called to complain & was told the reason was miscommunication, they were busy, they shouldn't have told me it was going to be 15 minutes, etc....  Terrible service!

Brittany was our server and if you get in her section bring some crackers. She's terrible.

203,Raisha S.,"Atlanta, GA",156,70,118.0,2.0,2017-12-11,"I've been to cheesecake factories before, this place is known for being packed and hours of wait time which wasn't different for us on a Sunday night either. We had a 70 minute wait time, still opted for it because of the group we were in, didn't mind the wait too much. When our wait was over and we got the text, there was another 10-15 min wait to get seated. So after an hour and a half wait as we get seated, there wasn't a server to our table for another few minutes. Silverware missing, had to grab it ourselves from another table because the wait is too long when we asked for anything. Didn't get water or menu for a while again. No fresh bread either, it was apparently in the oven forever.  We ordered Louisiana chicken Pasta and Parmesan Chicken Pasta Pizza. Food arrived another 30 mins later. Although the portion size was great, the food quality was below average. Wasn't fresh, everything tasted as if they were frozen. By that time in 3 hours the restaurant was already half empty, so not sure why there was still so much of a delay. All servers are running around but didn't seem to get anything done - probably short staffed. Multiple tables were having similar issues like us.  Cheesecake Factory is a popular chain in the nation, receiving such poor service and food was highly disappointing - most likely never going back.

It took an unusually long time just to get our drinks and even longer for our appetizers (30 minutes to be exact).  Management did explain the cook burned one of the appetizers, that explains the delay for the chicken quesadillas . To top things off, we used the rest rooms which was in a horrible state (not clean at all).  I had to ask an employee to please make sure management takes care that. Last but not lest, I wanted to order a slice of strawberry cheesecake to go however they were out  I will say that I've visited this location at least a half dozen times before and this is my first bad experience.  If that was not the case, this recipe would have one star.   !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-4,3.12,3.03,3.03,,3.066

180,Jack S.,"Atlanta, GA",1,12,3.0,1.0,2017-12-21,"50 minutes.  That's how long it took from order to food delivered to table on a Thursday night.  Got there at 830, waited for a table until 9, ordered at 915, dinner ""served"" at 1005. Not even an apology for how long that took.   No restaurant in the world is worth that sort of wait. We should have just walked.  There's nothing special about this food--it's just another chain. With so many great options in Atlanta, I got outvoted because a few people in my party really wanted ""great"" desserts.  The cheesecakes are frozen, people.  They are made somewhere else and frozen, then (mostly) thawed at the locations.  I am re-evaluating my ""friends"" that thought this place was a great idea. Such poor judgement suggest deficiencies elsewhere.

201,Ashley T.,"Old Fourth Ward, Atlanta, GA",80,205,273.0,5.0,2017-12-22,"It's a tradition that my co-workers and I come here for our annual Christmas party and besides coming with my co-workers one time a year, I can say I rarely venture to Cheesecake Factory.  It was super busy at the mall (when isn't it?) so finding parking was an issue but my superpower patience kicked in and finally found a spot on the other side of Switzerland.  Anyway, I got there about 10 mins after they open and was able to put our name on the list but of course we couldn't be seated until half of our party showed.  The hostess was kind and checked in with me periodically as to whether or not my party showed and we were seated as soon as everyone arrived.   The restaurant is huge and has both indoor and outdoor seating as well as a take out area andddd the amazing display glass of cheesecakes.  I do wish they would make the waiting area bigger because that place gets packed and when there's a line, it's just super congested and you don't know who's waiting or who's in line to be put on the waitlist.  We were seated in the back of the restaurant but for a group of our size, they put us at the smallest table.  There were any other tables we could move to so we bunched up and made it work. Our waitress Jade was sweet and I loved how she interacted with the group.  She was attentive, apologized for delays, and I could tell she was a people person and handled our group with ease and threw in jokes here and there so that made our visit enjoyable.  The menus are huge and have sooooi many items to pick from (they do need to be cleaned because most of them were quite sticky) but I kept is simple and ordered the pasta carbonara which came with green peas, bacon, a garlic Parmesan cream sauce, and I added chicken.  It arrived hot and smelled reallllly good.  The sauce wasn't overwhelming and the bacon was divine.  I also ordered a red sangria (kudos to the bartender) and the white chocolate cheesecake to take home (ohhhh it's in the fridge and will be noshed upon at the perfect time). Overall a great experience and if Jade's manager sees this.  Give. That. Lady. A. Raise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-4,3.12,3.01,3.01,,3.054

After we were seated, we ordered drinks, Gin on the rocks, and a few appetizers, Fried Calamari, Buffalo Blast,  and a Greek Salad. The Greek salad was great, the calamari was cold, and the Buffalo blast was sent back to the kitchen. The server was friendly, but she totally kept forgetting to pick up the dirty plates from our tiny table for 2.
