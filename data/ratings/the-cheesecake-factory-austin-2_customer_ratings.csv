I LIKE NORDIE'S BISTRO AND SARKU TOO!"" ************************ (Editor's note: Errol M actually lives in a very small world. The new Cheesecake Factory at Barton Creek Mall is a superb example of maximized seating in a minimal space, along with its ""inside patio"" & outside tables. It has the same extended CF hours & extended menu, along with the best-trained staff in the business. They've introduced valet service to this old-school Simon mall, and it's simply hard to dislike their cheesecake.

67,Dennis G.,"Kyle, TX",101,64,69.0,4.0,2015-09-02,"TLDR: Day service from the kitchen is still a work-in-progress. Go for dinner or give them at least another couple of weeks before dropping by for lunch....Unless you have a couple of hours to play with. Food was excellent as usual from CCF.  Have Time: I kind of feel like my in-store comments to the manager fell on deaf ears so this is mostly a ""just in case"" review/shout out.  Thank you Zumar for the excellent service and attention!!  Day shift servers don't get enough appreciation! Basically since this is still a less than two-week old location, they have the ""green"" cooks working during the slower day shifts and the experienced guys putting out plates at night, this makes sense to me. What doesn't make sense is that it took about 30 minutes to put out a:  -Caesar Salad -Personal pizza -Pulled Pork Sandwich All of which tasted phenomenal BTW. These are all pretty easy lunch items. Zumar did everything he could to expedite the meal, he kept checking in the kitchen, he made sure our drinks and bread stayed fresh, he even comped a piece of cheesecake for the wait.  I'll give them another chance simply because of Zumar's service. I told Mr. Manager this but I didn't feel confident this would go anywhere, considering he went right back to his conversation, I didn't see him write anything down.  Drop in for dinner or give them another couple of weeks to get the day cooks together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin-2?start=80,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.5120000000000005

Came on Saturday for lunch and waiting was 10 minutes for 2 which is alright. Bar area is small but service was quick. Dont make the mistake of laying your drink on their wood cabinets because there is nowhere else to set your drink like I did. Manager kindly asked me to move to marble countertop area which was near POS system. Not my first choice but ok sir. Anywho rest of experience was service with a smile and prompt servvice. (Thank you Iris) Food is what you came to expect from Cheesecake factory, so thats good. We had the Fried Macaroni and cheese balls, the fried avocado-mushroom-zuchinni spears and a salted carmel cheesecake. Not exactly a healthy lunch with beer, but hey!, its good eating.

As soon as we walked in the door I was very excited and then immediately pissed. A place that looks as gorgeous as this should have top notch employees. We stood in front of the hostess podium for a couple of minutes being completely, and blatantly ignored by 4 hostesses while they enjoyed their conversation. There was hardly anyone in the restaurant. My husband finally chimed in and said, ""Two please."" And without even a, ""Hello"", or a ""Sorry"", or even a care in the world one of them bitchily says, ""Your name."" ""We'll be with you in a few minutes."" Then a few minutes pass by and they sit us at a table with 8 plate settings! Wtf? The waiter had a better attitude then the hostesses. Which is the only reason this place gets stars at all. These employees need to take a field trip to Chick-fil-a and learn a little bit about customer service. If I was a manager at this cheesecake restaurant I would be absolutely ashamed.

I tried the crab cakes....a giant 10-inch tall salad that looked like a beaver hut and tasted super yum.....the fresh yet conventional salmon dinner with fries....the enormous plate of nachos big enough to feed a pee wee football team....the chocolate cheesecake....and the strawberry cheesecake. Oh, and the hand-squeezed strawberry lemonade.* Service was phenomenal. There was even a crazy moment where a new person was being trained and the trainer would stand behind the trainee and write down on a little pad of paper what needed to be spoken aloud. I felt as if I were in a Vaclav Havel play for a moment there.  There is marble, marble everywhere, and even marbled cheesecake to eat.  I can't say I would go here for a date night, but if I were ever in the mall with friends or family, and got hungry, I would definitely choose this place over any other restaurant in the Barton Creek shopping compound, including CA Pizza Kitchen or Abuelos.  Whatever you do, be warned:  1) There are over 250 items on the menu 2) The portions are HUGE.  So, it probably is not good to bring your indecisive, dieting friend here for her/his birthday.

Okay, I get it, sometimes a wait goes longer. But after waiting 50 minutes THEY SAT US IN THE BAR. Other people walked in way after us and walked up to bar tables and waited for them to be cleared and  then took a seat PRIOR to us being seated. If I am going to wait for close to an hour, don't seat me in a bar area where then have to wait even longer for a server trying to manage far more tables than he is able.

Most mistakes I can overlook at a new restaurant, but this was not a simple mistake. This was dangerous. We alerted out waitress but didn't get so much as an apology. It was basically, ""Oh shucks, let us remake that for you."" The waitress didn't apologize, the manager was having a goodbye-party in the back and we never heard from her. We paid for an entree that had to be remade (for SAFETY reasons) and came out 20 minutes after everyone else's food. Basically, we were served contaminated food and a $100 bill. The Cheesecake Factory, this was not an acceptable response to something so serious. When we have to visit a doctor after eating at your restaurant, the very least you should do is apologize.

The Ahi Tartare... a nightmare. The raw tuna was not even diced/sliced properly.. The pieces were like half cut, but still stuck on to each other like links of fish?

However, it was a lot spicier than predicted and the dish was SO SALTY, I needed to drink so much water! The Thai lettuce wraps was OK, but the butter lettuce used was not fresh.

Which you would think at a place called Cheescake Factory the furniture would lean toward the heavy side but it was more like outdoor furniture. Okay enough about furniture. Once you are seated have fun reading the menu which way too many pages of food. We split an order of avacado egg rolls which by the way were delicious. Then we made the mistake of ordering an entree. I had a carbonara plate. Huge portions it was yummy but after three bites I knew it would go home to make another meal. I had to have a slice of tres leche cheesecake. It was heavenly. My companion had lemon meringue cheesecake that was out of this world. All in all we both dropped $30 a piece which is pricey but it fed me twice. Very good overall good service and a desire for more cheesecake in my future.

In short: they cooked it with cheese, realized their mistake, scraped it off (likely holding it in their hand) not getting it off successfully from the entire dish, put it back, forgot the sauce, and voilà: my dish. You mess it up? Redo it! I had to throw it away because the image of someone in your kitchen scraping off the cheese of the meal was gross.

But we go out to eat because food is delicious, much more so when you don't have to make it yourself, and that is where I ran into some problems.  I ordered a burger off of their (way too) large menu.  So many choices.  When your menu has ads for other items, you need to trim it down a bit.  The server said it could be cooked to order and didn't bat an eyelash when I asked for rare/medium rare. After a moderate wait, the food came and I ate the French fries first because obviously fries lose that special something when they get cold and they are just never the same.  Then I cut into my burger and it is super well done. Not a hint of pink to be found, at all.  The server decides that this is the perfect time to transport to an alternate dimension, fall in love, have children, grow old, and then come back to this dimension and check on us. I tell her about the burger and how I can't eat it since it is wildly overcooked.  She asks if I want a replacement. I say no because I had filled up on the bread and fries and since there was the long wait until she came back, my body got the memo that it is full. So she brings out the receipt and my burger is still on it. I ask her to remove the burger that I couldn't eat and that she took away and just charge me for the fries.  I have never seen someone look so lost and confused before.  Ten minutes pass. A manager comes over and starts talking about the burger. Saying it is a delightfully tasty entrée and that he is sorry it was mixed up. I said I was sorry as well but we would really like the check now please.  He comes back with another burger and tries to give it to me.  I explained, again, that I didn't want the burger. I was full and it was unnecessary and it wasn't even the right burger.  Fifteen minutes later, we finally get the updated check. They did comp my entire entrée and fries but that was not the issue.  I would have happily paid for the fries because I ate the fries. I left my tip and moved on with my life.  Honestly, this has happened at literally every Cheesecake Factory I go to.  My order is always screwed up, no matter what I order. This was my first time getting a burger and it surely will be my last.  Probably even my last time at any location, at least for a good amount of time.  This one is pretty but a bit cramped since it is in the mall.  Nice server who still was tipped heavily because she didn't do anything wrong.  Maybe speed service up a bit?

We were acknowledged by the guy (unfortunately we were unable to get his name) with him saying, ""they'll be right with you""... He then walked away to make small talk with the hostess. He could has easily helped us. Meanwhile the other two girls behind the counter never acknowledged us.  Anyway, we left without cheesecake and a very uneasy feeling.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin-2?start=20,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.572,2.88

I would definitely give 5stars to my server Emily who were really kind and professional. I feel even so sorry for Emily that i am giving 1star just because of a rude hostess Jamila (i am not even sure if i spelled it right) who can never say sorry to customers that were pretty irritated by her attitude. it was my party's turn to be seated after 20 minutes waiting. We approached to the hostess and she told my girl friend to step aside so she can talk to a lady behind of us. If was our turn and the ones who were behind were seated first. We also got seated right after but i was quite upset about the behavior and headed back to the hostess station. All she said was that ""oh we dont do it that way. I told you to step aside so you could be seated."" Now what. I explained how we were irritated and she would never say sorry. I did not want to argue and told her that it was all our fault to get upset because you did not do anything wrong. Guess what she said. ""Oh yes we dont do it that way."" And i got sick of talking to someone who does not understand human language.

26,Omar R.,"San Marcos, TX",1,14,16.0,4.0,2016-12-08,"Walking into the Cheesecake Factory it reminds me of a cruise liner's restaurant. I don't know why. Maybe because the layout has a lot of curvature. Glancing around, the restaurant looks really taking care of. Very whimsical in a professional manner.  Michael, my waiter, was quick to serve my table. (I timed it btw) as he quickly brought my drink and a side of bread with butter. He was knowable about what's on the menu, very helpful for any first timer. Also adding I never had an empty cup. So far so good...now I wait for my order. (FOOD) I ordered something simple, the Americana Cheeseburger with the side green salad, a sweet tea and an order of the original cheesecake. ( Of course I'm going to get a cheesecake, it's the freaking Cheesecake Factory).  Out came the order and it looks fantastic.  Americana Cheeseburger was great. The potato crisps as the garnish was a well addition to the burger, it had a nice little crunch to the burger. The top bun was lightly toast with their secret sauce spread (not bad) it had a light sweet taste to it, but went well with the burger as a whole. The grilled onions might have been a little over cooked. (Personally I was never a fan of onions, so...). Ordering this burger you will not be disappointed, its a simple classic.  The green salad is what you think it is, romaine with light ranch dressing and a tomato wedge. It was good. It was a salad.  The cheesecake was excellent. I'd be disappointed otherwise, because obviously reasons, right... The experience was great. Will I come back again, yes I would. Recommend? Yes.  Don't let bad reviews or even good reviews make your decision. I just told you my own experience. Try it out for yourself and you be the judge. Good luck.

We noticed that the bar had a number of open tables, and she told us that we could be served dessert there (all we wanted). Although the bar was not especially crowded, the service was ridiculously slow. It was probably 20 - 25 minutes before our orders were taken and at least that long again to receive our desserts. Remember, the desserts are already prepared and cut, they just have to be plated.

Service: 4  Food: 5 Ambience: 5  The only reason I'm docking a point off service is because of how busy they are. The servers always seem to have more tables than they can handle but are sweet regardless.  With their huge portion sizes, the prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. This is not the place to go if you're on a diet haha even though they do have a Skinnylicious Menu for those looking for a lighter fare. Everything on their Skinny Menu doesn't taste quite as rich as their regular menu but that makes sense considering it lacks butter and such.  Another reason I enjoy Cheesecake Factory is the wheat and sourdough bread that comes for FREE with your meal! The bread is warm and I always land up eating more of it than I should.

Maybe their oven is too hot? But everything is always burnt. The bread is hard as a rock and burnt, the biscuits on the chicken and biscuits were like hockey pucks.

We were actually talking about getting up and just leaving and she finally showed up.  The food took a long time. It was after lunch time and I'm not sure why it took so long.  The food was so disappointing. Flavorless grilled chicken. Fries that were warm but tasted old.  We got the jambalaya with extra sausage and chicken and we could hardly find one piece of sausage in it.  We will not be back to this location for the bad service and less than mediocre food. We live close to the arboretum and that's the only location worth going to.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin-2,2.92,2.79,2.79,,2.8419999999999996
5,Gina H.,"Austin, TX",427,243,1492.0,5.0,2017-06-16,I am thrilled to eat at this location everything was great except the Beef medallions  was a little  tough overall good. Parking easy especially lunch crowd. Janne is our server attentive  and polite  clam chowder is to die for... Salmon was very good as well. I will try more of the menu upon my return. The kale salad served with the crusted salmon was tasty and loved the way it was cooked. This location is at the Barton Creek mall which is off mopac and loop 1. I ordered the lemonade is not tart but perfect the way lemonade should taste. I would let everyone know they do get busy since they are right next door to a movie theater so just to tell you serving can be a bit of a wait.

31,Sara H.,"Austin, TX",3,5,2.0,2.0,2017-07-02,I ordered takeout- not worth the money at all. Their Caesar dressing tastes nothing like caesar. It was basically ranch so I threw it away.

We had a a party of 5, and our wait time was only 15 minutes.  Service was great, the hostess and the waitress were really nice and accommodating. The waitress was really sweet and on top of it! I can appreciate that.  The food was delicious.  Appetizers: -Fried Mac & Cheese Balls: crunchy on the outside, perfectly mac and cheesy on the inside WOW  -avocado egg rolls: pretty good!  Entrees:  Bistro shrimp pasta (we all got this)  Pretty good- although a bit greasy  Cheesecake:  Tiramisu cheesecake- mmmm I love anything tiramisu so this may be biased but it was so amazingly delicious.

7,Wayne N.,"Austin, TX",61,587,133.0,3.0,2017-07-10,"Surprisingly, despite living for 27 years now, this is my first trip to any Cheesecake Factory. That's pretty shocking considered how popular it is to many people. A friend gave me a gift card here for helping him out, so figured now is as good as ever to try it out. Although I wasn't ecstatic about my visit, I will say I can cross an item off my to do list of food things every person growing up should try. That said, as much as I appreciate the calorie info on the menu, it's kinda disgusting how unhealthy everything is, especially since the portion size is pretty normal sized...that said it'll help you make some better health decisions cause the taste that you get is marginal difference. The bread is pretty good. Normally I reach for the white bread and though the sourdough baguette is alright, the brown bread with the oats is pretty good. A little pat of butter makes it great. And as for what we ate? I got the chicken madeira and steak diane combo - the wife got the herbed salmon and shrimp scampi. The chicken madeira as their signature dish I would have expected more from. A razor thin chicken cutlet with cheese and chicken wasn't that impressive. The mashed potatoes are buttery and chunky with the red skins, so I appreciate the all natural feel of it. The steak diane is good - sirloin tips with a bit of heat and creamy sauce. Salmon is perfectly cooked and flaky with some herbaceous notes. The shrimp scampi was the favorite of them all - though it tastes more like roasted shrimp than any shrimp scampi I've ever had. Weird it didn't come with noodles on the combo plate either. So the food is pretty good, cheesecake slices are huge, but just can't help but think given what else is in Austin (and even within similar genres), there's better to be had. Sorry to be a local snob over the chain, but hard to argue with the truth....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin-2,3.08,2.86,2.86,,2.9480000000000004
14,Russell S.,"Houston, TX",333,3,1.0,2.0,2017-07-20,"Wanted to get a warning to Vegans or people with food allergies. This location has no problem serving foods without following your requests. Our visit began with a 40 minute wait for edamame. The server came by and offered us free cups of soup for inconvenience and blamed the slow service on the computer system going down.  When we finally received our order, they served our veggie burger which we ordered dry with mustard on the side, fully loaded with mayonnaise. No mustard to be found. We waited 20 minutes with no sign of our server. So battling between ethics of eating the eggs in mayo or going without lunch, decided to scrape off the mayo best we could and eat the burger with ketchup.  We told the server and she asked what our problem was with her. We told the manager and he seemed to not care. Now I am wondering if our pasta was dipped in butter instead of the olive oil as we asked. Lucky this wasn't a food allergy or we would be off to the hospital. Just be careful when you eat here.  They really don't care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin-2,2.96,2.86,2.86,,2.9

My now fiancée attempted to propose to me here last weekend. The floor was so disgusting she couldn't even get down on one knee to pop the question in fear of ruining her pants. And let's not mention how inconsiderate and rude our waitress was. Maybe she wasn't too fond of seeing a lesbian couple, I don't know. It was no excuse for her lackluster service. She seemed as if she just wanted us gone. I am extremely disappointed in the Cheesecake Factory. I love going here, but I had much better service at the one in Houston.

15,Lisa H.,"Berkeley, CA",0,5,3.0,5.0,2017-09-16,"Well I came in dressed in my gym clothes because I planned to work out afterwards. I was greeted kindly and with a smile by the hostess. I wanted a particular booth that was somewhat quiet. The host gave the staff person the directive to find such a booth for me, I followed.  She took me outside of the inside dining area, and pointed to, not a booth, but a table closest to all the chaotic crowds that was trafficking the mall. I asked to be placed in a booth that was quiet and away from lots of people she was taken aback a little so she stared at me not understanding. She asked me to repeat, I did so. I went back inside she followed me. She said, ""All of the two-party booths booths are taken,"" implying that I have no choice but to take what she's chosen for me.  That would never do for me, I would've driven away and gone elsewhere. But instead I looked around and found an empty booth in the corner close to the bar, no one was in it apparently it was a ""four party booth."" I could see the struggle in her face... Number one, I was not ""four people,"" and number two, I was dressed in my gym clothes. I understand.  But I was not going to be any longer than an hour. So I let her know that that's the booth I prefer. She said, ""let me go see if my supervisor approves."" Or something to that effect. She began to walk towards the host and I followed...really in case there's a short conversation against my sitting there. She realized I was behind her and so she pointed to the booth without a word so that the host could see which table it was. The host said ""OK."" So she led me to the table, I said ""thank you"" genuinely, but she just walked away. I felt a little chill; and it wasn't the air-conditioning. I hope she wasn't upset but if she was, perhaps there's more customer service learning to do on her part.  My experience became a more positive one when I met my waiter, Castro. He was upbeat and kind. He was funny, light, and very creative in this banter with me. I hadn't been to this restaurant in a long while in fact I used to go to the one up north in the Arboretum often years ago. This is the first time actually sat down in this particular location. I usually get either the salmon dinner or the salad and pizza. The salad was well-dressed, there was not a leaf of lettuce that did not have Caesar dressing on it, the right   was crisp to the last bite, and I don't croutons but they were really big and enticing. They were toasted in such a way you could get a crunch and  wouldn't break your teeth. I tried one.  Since I was getting the lunch special which was a salad and a small pizza I didn't want to load too many carbs up. By the time I had my slice of pizza I was already full.  So now I have pizza for dinner since I got the rest of it to go.  There was no attitude toward me about my reading and writing during my meal.  I could take my time I think. I spent about 45 minutes to an hour at my booth. Castro remained kind in a non-strained sort of way, it was genuine. I left the restaurant with a light heart grateful to have a little privacy within the public crowded mall.  The restaurant space inside manages to have their own ambience apart from the mall chaos. I recommend it. It is a good place to unwind and have a nice meal after a days worth of shopping.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin-2,2.92,2.82,2.82,,2.86

My last three experiences have been less than adequate. The last one though completely blew me away with her rude tone and inability to understand our order.  She seemed polite at first but as time went by she had a frustrated tone. We ordered something they ran out of and I was a little upset but accepted it. Her response ""oh yeah sorr----y"" was what made me question her. After this she messed up our order and then at the end didn't offer us second drinks, immediately wanted to give us a box and made me box my food (I don't care if I had to do it I just know they do that there and I always liked that).

My son has swim class off Bee Cave so I decided to treat myself to two of my favorite things from TCF; pumpkin pecan cheesecake, and their French country salad. I looked a hot mess after the pool so I called my order in. Customer service was great, from my phone order to picking up, AND I got a front row spot at the mall for once.  The anticipation was killer on the drive home, I contemplated taking the cheesecake out for a bite while stopped at a light. I refrained because I didn't feel like teasing myself. I get home, take a bite of cheesecake before I open my salad - AMAZING, everything I've been hoping and dreaming about. Then I decide to tear into the salad. I LOVE the dressing so I drizzled every last drop on that shizz. I start munching, eating mostly spring mix with plenty of dressing, saving the best for last. I get to the bottom layer of greens, and an so upset to see the lack of components that make the salad so yummy. I literally recall 4 pieces of asparagus, and very little goat cheese. This is an $11 salad, so I definitely felt ripped off. Had I dined in I would've sent it back to be remade, but I was 18 miles away, and stuck with it. Damn you, salad maker, damn you.

It took our server over 10 mins to greet us, and then we had to wait for bread and our sweet teas. No worries, we were patient.
