137,Aaryn P.,"Cedar Park, TX",296,722,190.0,2.0,2012-01-07,"This particular CcF is dramatically beautiful - inside and out. Unfortunately, the meals, (mainly) ho-hum service and  general experience did not match the grand decor of the place.  We came in for lunch today and were seated right away which was a plus. Our waiter came by a few minutes later and took our drink order. In true CcF fashion, it took us about 15-20 minutes to pour over the exhaustingly huge menu. Our waiter came back and took our order - we had: 2 Pizza/Salad Lunch Specials 1 Wild Mushroom Bread 1 Order of Sliders 1 Order TexMex Eggrolls Everything came out fairly quickly and the food was alright. So, what was my big problem here? For some reason, our waiter had memory problems, and unfortunately they were directed towards one particular person in our party. This person initially ordered coffee. When he was done with his coffee the waiter came over and asked him if he wanted a refill, and he said, ""No, but I think I'll switch to Coke."" We waited for that Coke... the waiter even came back and refilled everyone else's drinks without bringing that Coke or re-asking the person if they wanted anything else to drink. So, someone had an extra water, and they gave it to that person... but there was no straw. The same guy asks the waiter for a straw...and we wait for the straw...and wait. His girlfriend finally had to ask a second time for a straw. It was just a little wtf, that's all.  Anyways... I'd give this place 3 stars for A-Ok because..ehh it was anything special, but it was alright...but the service needs to improve before I add that third star. Meh, I've had better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=200,2.92,3.27,3.27,2.8560000000000003,3.13

Luckily we had not had any bad experience as of yet, I do think their prices are a bit high, but the food is great. but paying 3$ for ice tea is a bit much...but in general its a good environment and their new french toast are absolutely AMAZING but dont look at the calories lol.... Im french Canadian and they use REAL maple syrup but their syrup tasted differently it was a lot sweeter.. so I ask our waitress; she was very friendly to us (her name was Noel) and she told us that they put butter in their maple syrup and I have to admit it was VERY VERY VERY good. again fatning as hell Im sure.. but once in a blue moon we need to spoil ourselves right :)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=360,3.04,3.27,3.27,3.056,3.178

Bucks a plate I would think it would be top notch. Then the steak n shrimp plates u get like 3 shrimp and about 4 pieces of small cut up steak for 21.

They seated us in 3 back to back booths, so we were all split up and could not see or talk to each other. I give it 2 stars only because the food was good. Since we had a party of 20, they could not handle splitting up the checks. It took 45 minutes for them to determine the bill after we ate. We kept asking about splitting the bill from the time we started ordering drinks and they said it would be no big deal at the end.

Unfortunately, the meals, (mainly) ho-hum service and  general experience did not match the grand decor of the place.  We came in for lunch today and were seated right away which was a plus. Our waiter came by a few minutes later and took our drink order. In true CcF fashion, it took us about 15-20 minutes to pour over the exhaustingly huge menu. Our waiter came back and took our order - we had: 2 Pizza/Salad Lunch Specials 1 Wild Mushroom Bread 1 Order of Sliders 1 Order TexMex Eggrolls Everything came out fairly quickly and the food was alright. So, what was my big problem here? For some reason, our waiter had memory problems, and unfortunately they were directed towards one particular person in our party. This person initially ordered coffee. When he was done with his coffee the waiter came over and asked him if he wanted a refill, and he said, ""No, but I think I'll switch to Coke."" We waited for that Coke... the waiter even came back and refilled everyone else's drinks without bringing that Coke or re-asking the person if they wanted anything else to drink. So, someone had an extra water, and they gave it to that person... but there was no straw. The same guy asks the waiter for a straw...and we wait for the straw...and wait. His girlfriend finally had to ask a second time for a straw. It was just a little wtf, that's all.  Anyways...

What a disaster it was this time! We each ordered something different after having a drink. My wife and I decided to split a $7 small asian salad rather than the huge $14 salad served as an entree. The friendly but untrained waiter served us the expensive one. A few minutes later while serving the first two of the four entrees, the waiter nonchalantly said to one of our friends, ""I'm sorry. We're out of the sushi."" No kidding! That was our friend's entree choice ... not an appetizer. He had to wait another 20 minutes for his entree which was served as the other three were perusing the cheesecake menu. The icing on the cake was our cheesecake order ... which was why we went there in the first place. My wife and I selected two choices in case they were out of our first choice. ""Do you have these two?"" we asked the waiter. He seemed a bit insulted, ""Of course we do. We ALWAYS have every cheesecake on the menu."" He returned 10 minutes later and said sheepishly, ""Uh. We're out of your two choices. What's your next choice?"" What a joke! We did select another cheesecake, which was tasty but pricey.

The friendly but untrained waiter served us the expensive one. A few minutes later while serving the first two of the four entrees, the waiter nonchalantly said to one of our friends, ""I'm sorry. We're out of the sushi."" No kidding! That was our friend's entree choice ... not an appetizer. He had to wait another 20 minutes for his entree which was served as the other three were perusing the cheesecake menu. The icing on the cake was our cheesecake order ... which was why we went there in the first place. My wife and I selected two choices in case they were out of our first choice. ""Do you have these two?"" we asked the waiter. He seemed a bit insulted, ""Of course we do. We ALWAYS have every cheesecake on the menu."" He returned 10 minutes later and said sheepishly, ""Uh. We're out of your two choices. What's your next choice?"" What a joke! We did select another cheesecake, which was tasty but pricey.

The amount of stuff on the menu is overwhelming and leads me to believe they are mostly prepared from frozen food. Which leads to my other observation that many of the dishes are very salty. Obviously the cheesecake is great. It's what gets people in the door, and rightfully so. But beyond that, its a place that is expensive and specializes in nothing.

I was excited not only because it was my sister's birthday (party of 16) but also it was my first time being at The Cheesecake Factory. It is a very nice place but after about 1.5 hours later we were finally seated. The food was pretty good. We left the restaurant around midnight and noticed several cop cars out front. We get to our truck only to find out we've been a victim of ""ATTEMPTED AUTO THEFT."" The thieves broke the lock to our truck and also jammed and damaged/broke our ignition switch. Our truck couldn't even start!! My family was stranded! I was in shock because this has never happened to us, not to mention we couldn't believe this actually happened in a ""nice"" part of town.   So here is my question: Where was the mobile security patrol? Hmmm good question! We filed a police report and were told by officer M. Heyward that 4 trucks (in addition to ours) were also broken into ....WOW UNBELIEVABLE!!   Result: So here is my little family, stranded with no option other than my husband calling a tow truck company from the town we live, which by the way is about 45 minutes away from Austin. I was in complete shock all weekend until Monday. I called Cheesecake Factory early Monday and spoke with manager Sherston to let them know what happened in their parking lot and felt someone should be liable for their customer's damaged property. Unfortunately, Sherston was quite insensitive and quickly referred me to Simon Properties. I called Simon Property early Tuesday only to be instructed to call back after 1 p.m.   Conclusion: When customers visit an establishment, they should have a reasonable sense of security that their belongings will be safe. If something is damaged, there is such thing called insurance....but I find even getting to this point is almost impossible... so far. 2 stars because the cheese cake is excellent !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=220,2.96,3.09,3.16,2.148,3.038

We sat at the bar both times. I had high expectations going both times due to all the hype Ive heard from friends and others. Both times we went, we had the same bartender, I believe Jackie is her name. She was attentive and fantastic both times we were there. Never a dry drink and quick with any requests we had. The cheesecake we had was ""Adams Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple"".

The guac was good and fresh, but I had to salt it 4 times before I felt like it was right. Guac is very simple, salt being one of the key ingredients. I thought it perplexing that there was little or none in ours, and at $10.95 I dont feel like a little salt is a lot to ask for. The parm polenta fries struck me as straight out of a frozen bag into a deep frier, nothing special here. The crispy crab bites had big chunks of crab in them which was nice, but they were slightly undercooked, pretty greasy and served with a side of what Im assuming was supposed to be tartar sauce. It was more like mayo with 4 peices of relish in it. The dynamite shrimp was a big let down. There was nothing dynamite about it. There was no heat anywhere in the dish and the flavors were pedestrian at best. The worst thing we had was the Vietnamese tacos.

162,Ryan H.,"Cedar Park, TX",6,169,6.0,2.0,2013-05-02,"There is nothing inherently wrong with this place besides maybe the prices. Its just underwhelming. The prices are very high for what you are eating (typical appetizer in the $8-10 range and meals about $15 all the way up to $30 for a ribeye). The amount of stuff on the menu is overwhelming and leads me to believe they are mostly prepared from frozen food. Which leads to my other observation that many of the dishes are very salty. Obviously the cheesecake is great. It's what gets people in the door, and rightfully so. But beyond that, its a place that is expensive and specializes in nothing. Its probably good for a group of picky eaters because the menu is so large its hard to find something thats not on there.

I was excited not only because it was my sister's birthday (party of 16) but also it was my first time being at The Cheesecake Factory. It is a very nice place but after about 1.5 hours later we were finally seated. The food was pretty good. We left the restaurant around midnight and noticed several cop cars out front. We get to our truck only to find out we've been a victim of ""ATTEMPTED AUTO THEFT."" The thieves broke the lock to our truck and also jammed and damaged/broke our ignition switch. Our truck couldn't even start!! My family was stranded! I was in shock because this has never happened to us, not to mention we couldn't believe this actually happened in a ""nice"" part of town.   So here is my question: Where was the mobile security patrol? Hmmm good question! We filed a police report and were told by officer M. Heyward that 4 trucks (in addition to ours) were also broken into ....WOW UNBELIEVABLE!!   Result: So here is my little family, stranded with no option other than my husband calling a tow truck company from the town we live, which by the way is about 45 minutes away from Austin. I was in complete shock all weekend until Monday. I called Cheesecake Factory early Monday and spoke with manager Sherston to let them know what happened in their parking lot and felt someone should be liable for their customer's damaged property. Unfortunately, Sherston was quite insensitive and quickly referred me to Simon Properties. I called Simon Property early Tuesday only to be instructed to call back after 1 p.m.   Conclusion: When customers visit an establishment, they should have a reasonable sense of security that their belongings will be safe. If something is damaged, there is such thing called insurance....but I find even getting to this point is almost impossible... so far. 2 stars because the cheese cake is excellent !",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=220,2.72,2.89,3.156,1.924,2.822

345,Mrs. M.,"Austin, TX",0,82,4.0,2.0,2014-01-03,"I have eaten here many times and it is nothing special for the cost of an arm and a leg.  The menu is, indeed, overwhelming and you can't get through it in one night, so you might do well to choose a ""favorite"" if you are thinking of returning.  The cheesecake, itself, is pretty good (the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle is my personal top choice) but did you know you can buy a whole one at Costco or Sam's or wherever for, like, half the price?  Buy the plain and add your own toppings and save yourself the trip.  The wait is almost always long.  I have to use the light from my phone to see my food.  And they fail to mention that when your selection from the children's menu can include juice, the orange juice will cost you an additional $3 because it is ""fresh-squeezed.""  What that means is it is a $3 glass of pulp with seeds.  My daughter didn't even drink it, and thus we avoided a potentially hazardous situation.  Many better restaurants to choose from in this city, so take your pick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=400,2.12,2.62,2.996,3.1120000000000005,2.42

The Cheesecake Factory has a great selection of cakes as you walk in. I've always ordered a slice or two on my way out. This night, however, featured some of the clumsiest and worst customer service I have ever experienced at a restaurant. It was a birthday dinner for a friend of ours. A cheesecake was purchased up front as we waited to be seated. The wait time was only a little over 30 minutes on a Friday for a large group. Not bad. That was the end of the good experience. The menu is overbearing, the servers have no idea what is available and what isn't available. You finally make a selection only to have the waiter come back ten minutes later and tell you there is no pizza dough. That is the most frustrating feeling when you are hungry. I tried to order a couple of margaritas while we waited. The waiter suggested I try some of the famous cocktails instead. He talked me into them, so we ordered two. Five minutes pass, no cocktails. Ten minutes... We ask him where the cocktails are? He looks up into the ceiling for a second as if he is in deep thought... Oh he forgot to key them into the system and they were never ordered. Wow what a disaster of a visit this is. Our food has already arrived, no drinks and a confused service attendant. We ended up declining to have the drinks ordered at this point. Why give them the money? We had mentioned at the beginning that it was someone's birthday at our table. The other tables around us got birthday songs and normal treatment. This waiter spaces, didn't say a word to our birthday patron and then managed to forget to bring out the cake twice. When he did finally bring out the cake, he kind of looked at us not saying a word.. then realized he had brought no plates or silverware for us to consume the cake with. As he reached over the cake to pickup our old plates, he almost made contact with the cake with his shirt several times. He then proceeded to bring out two boxes that didn't fit the cake. I've never seen someone so lost in space or on another planet in my life. Save yourself the trouble people. Order a dessert to go from the front and run run run away from here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=200,2.12,2.61,2.996,3.0760000000000005,2.414

Server was lots of fun, we really enjoyed her. Drinks were kind of steep, but we were all taking it easy anyway.

Cheesecake Factory is one of those strangely elusive chain restaurants that holds a special place in my heart. I spent my teenage and college years in Michigan and surprisingly there is NO Cheesecake Factory anywhere in the state. Strange, because Troy, MI (my hometown) is like the king of all large chain restaurants. Regardless, because of this cruel twist of faith that withheld Cheesecake Factory from my taste buds, I was determined to try it one day. I ended up trying it on a trip to Chicago and well, I didn't know what to order and was instantly overwhelmed by the monstrous menu. I remember the meal being decent, but somehow it didn't live up to my hope and dreams. Fast forward to two years later when I moved to Houston. I mentioned to my boyfriend at the time that I wasn't sure if I liked Cheesecake Factory and he insisted we go that day. I believe I got the Shrimp Etouffee and actually liked it. He got the Chicken Madeira which blew my Etouffee out of the water. I was sold. Since then I've gone to a few Cheesecake factories in various cities around the US. This location happens to be the only location in Austin. I like that it's almost always open until 11PM which is great for late night desserts! Most of the servers are pretty good but some standout ones are Natasha (I believe she introduces herself as 'Tashi), Tanner, and of course, as mentioned in my tip, Janelle.  I still go for the Chicken Madeira, but I've tried a few other items on the menu and have to admit that the Avocado Egg Rolls and the Thai Lettuce wraps are pretty good too.

I settled on Cheesecake Factory, knowing there extremely large menu and building would satisfy both issues.  I became, at first, slightly concerned by the reviews that were all over the place for this location. Then I got annoyed. Most reviews were about decor (that you don't eat) and menu size (you have to be extremely difficult to complain about TOO many choices.) so I decided to give it a shot anyway, having had excellent experiences with other locations in San Diego and Vegas. Our meal was perfect. Our party of 10 and 2 infants was sat immediately despite the after church crows (which is quite busy here in the South.) Between food allergies and picky eaters, we were not an easy group and our server Alicia handled it with ease. She was extremely attentive, but not annoying. She was quick on drink refills and ensuring we had everything we needed. Everything came out perfectly as ordered.

802,Ryan B.,"Austin, United States",242,190,169.0,1.0,2014-04-01,"Shockingly bad customer service experience. Disappointing visit after visiting this location multiple times. The Cheesecake Factory has a great selection of cakes as you walk in. I've always ordered a slice or two on my way out. This night, however, featured some of the clumsiest and worst customer service I have ever experienced at a restaurant. It was a birthday dinner for a friend of ours. A cheesecake was purchased up front as we waited to be seated. The wait time was only a little over 30 minutes on a Friday for a large group. Not bad. That was the end of the good experience. The menu is overbearing, the servers have no idea what is available and what isn't available. You finally make a selection only to have the waiter come back ten minutes later and tell you there is no pizza dough. That is the most frustrating feeling when you are hungry. I tried to order a couple of margaritas while we waited. The waiter suggested I try some of the famous cocktails instead. He talked me into them, so we ordered two. Five minutes pass, no cocktails. Ten minutes... We ask him where the cocktails are? He looks up into the ceiling for a second as if he is in deep thought... Oh he forgot to key them into the system and they were never ordered. Wow what a disaster of a visit this is. Our food has already arrived, no drinks and a confused service attendant. We ended up declining to have the drinks ordered at this point. Why give them the money? We had mentioned at the beginning that it was someone's birthday at our table. The other tables around us got birthday songs and normal treatment. This waiter spaces, didn't say a word to our birthday patron and then managed to forget to bring out the cake twice. When he did finally bring out the cake, he kind of looked at us not saying a word.. then realized he had brought no plates or silverware for us to consume the cake with. As he reached over the cake to pickup our old plates, he almost made contact with the cake with his shirt several times. He then proceeded to bring out two boxes that didn't fit the cake. I've never seen someone so lost in space or on another planet in my life. Save yourself the trouble people.

I don't know if the crab was off or it's just that awful a dish, but we each tried a couple spoonfuls of it and then ignored it in favor of the bread. My girlfriend got Evelyn's Pasta, which wasn't bad...in the middle. There was a huge ring of inedible pasta that had dried up from sitting under a heat lamp. I got the meatloaf. It was a different flavor than I was expecting, but okay. Then I noticed that the grilled onions in sauce (that was all over the meatloaf) had lots of inedible onion peel. So I decided to eat my sauteed spinach instead but it was so loaded down with pepper that I couldn't eat it.

Specifically that I ordered a $7 pretzel chicken app. It never arrived and about 10 minutes later, an ashen-faced manager arrived, apologized, and told me the kitchen had ruined it and it was the last one they had. This, after telling me it's a ""scratch kitchen."" If that is the case, shouldn't they be able to re-create it using fresh ingredients?

I settled on Cheesecake Factory, knowing there extremely large menu and building would satisfy both issues.  I became, at first, slightly concerned by the reviews that were all over the place for this location. Then I got annoyed. Most reviews were about decor (that you don't eat) and menu size (you have to be extremely difficult to complain about TOO many choices.) so I decided to give it a shot anyway, having had excellent experiences with other locations in San Diego and Vegas. Our meal was perfect. Our party of 10 and 2 infants was sat immediately despite the after church crows (which is quite busy here in the South.) Between food allergies and picky eaters, we were not an easy group and our server Alicia handled it with ease. She was extremely attentive, but not annoying. She was quick on drink refills and ensuring we had everything we needed. Everything came out perfectly as ordered.

Specifically that I ordered a $7 pretzel chicken app. It never arrived and about 10 minutes later, an ashen-faced manager arrived, apologized, and told me the kitchen had ruined it and it was the last one they had. This, after telling me it's a ""scratch kitchen."" If that is the case, shouldn't they be able to re-create it using fresh ingredients?

We were seated and waited forever for someone to wait on us. When our waitress came, we ordered drinks, waited about 10 mins. She left, came back another 10 mins to see if we were ready. We said we were still looking, and as soon we said that, she started to walk away and I had to shout out ""Ma'am!"", because I was expecting her to offer us an appetizer. I ordered the app, another waiter brought us our food, and refills on drinks. Our app took about 10 minutes, and after about 5-10 mins of eating our app, the waitress comes to our table and says, "" Let me get this app out your way"" and starts to walk away again. I shouted at her and said we were ready to order. Wow. She takes the order, the food comes out by yet another waiter, and we eat. At the end, she doesn't offer dessert, and so we asked for a dessert menu, because after all, this is cheesecake factory, and we had told the waitress it was a special day. We get some cheesecake to share and they bring us the plate with a candle. All in all, it was an okay dining experience, but come to find out, they were supposed to bring us bread (in the beginning), and the service really sucked! Not very impressionable for me, it being my first time; not very impressionable for my wife, it being her damn birthday. I feel let down, and after tipping a large amount, feel ripped off.

In fact I'd say if you took a grand hotel restaurant and made it larger and had itself cheesecake you would get precisely the Cheesecake Factory if you like that that's great I do.  Place is very clean staff is very friendly and attractive. But they are a little bit disorganized. I called for a pick up order and it took 30 minutes and it was only a burger and I was on hold for about 8 minutes. It wasn't a busy time it was 11 o'clock in the morning. I was a little surprised. There's a lady named  Kasey. Observing her multicolored nails and Super friendly attitude I became convinced she is quite rare and noteworthy.

Cool. we ask for comp bread and butter (waiter says they are out of bread and butter). so I order nachos so we can snack on something before our cheesecake comes.

394,Amanda S.,"Austin, TX",1070,644,5678.0,2.0,2015-03-10,"It was a friend's birthday and she wanted to have her birthday dinner at Cheesecake factory.  I knew I was in, but wasn't too excited.  I wasn't sure why.  I had been to Cheesecake Factory 2 other times - once in Hawaii with my family and once in Dallas with a large group of girls.  The only thing memorable from those 2 experiences was that I recall their portions being HUGE.  We had a party of 12 and had to wait about 30 minutes or so.  We went over to the bar and ordered drinks.  I ordered the Blueberry Mojito ... mistake on my part.  It was way, way too sweet.  It was really pretty though.  It was also an $11 drink ... a little pricey I think.  We finally got seated.  The service was pretty good from our server.  He never let anyone's water glass get empty, which I always appreciate.   Steve H and I decided to share the Thai Lettuce Wraps.  We knew that these would not be traditional Thai style but we were ok with that.  Steve H had done some research before hand and found that this is supposed to be one of the better dishes offered here.  Oh and by the way not only are the portions huge, but the menu is huge as well.  There are just so many options it is honestly a daunting task to look over the menu fully and make a decision on what to eat.  When our lettuce wraps got delivered they were on a huge plate.  My first thought was where is the chicken?  There was hardly any chicken on the plate for the plate to be so big.  I would have enjoyed my lettuce wraps a bit more if they had more protein in each wrap.  They were mostly veggie wraps with a bit a chicken.   Finally we got to the end of the meal and I was excited for my cheesecake - because who isn't at the cheesecake factory??  I went with the Vanilla Bean cheesecake.  It was definitely the highlight of my meal.   My friend next to me got the BBQ chicken salad she said it was ok, but the BBQ sauce was a little over powering.  I also tasted a Cuban egg roll or something and it was not good at all.   So overall my experience here was - meh.  Will I go back?  Probably not unless it is someone's birthday again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=40,3.12,3.0,2.976,2.7920000000000007,3.0480000000000005

To me it's worth it because I have not had another peach drink that I like as much as theirs, but to others $9+ might be a little much.

The booths offer a lot of privacy. The interior design is beyond extraordinary..... I feel like I'm in the lobby of the Hilton in Houston it's quite grand. In fact I'd say if you took a grand hotel restaurant and made it larger and had itself cheesecake you would get precisely the Cheesecake Factory if you like that that's great I do.  Place is very clean staff is very friendly and attractive. But they are a little bit disorganized. I called for a pick up order and it took 30 minutes and it was only a burger and I was on hold for about 8 minutes. It wasn't a busy time it was 11 o'clock in the morning. I was a little surprised. There's a lady named  Kasey. Observing her multicolored nails and Super friendly attitude I became convinced she is quite rare and noteworthy.

The usual stuff like living the dream & eternal sunshine kind of fall into that ""been there, done that"" category for me, and I've got to have something to wake up for. Incidentally, the journey can often be more rewarding than the destination.  But becoming Cheesecake Jesus requires some careful planning & patience on my part, or the carbs will blow me up like a cheap balloon. With one exception. When the delightful Ashley S texts with ""Let's do dessert,"" the proper response is ""Which two cheesecakes are we trying today?"" And we went with White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle & the S'mores Galore. And once you realize what seems to be melting vanilla ice cream is actually toasted marshmallow, you'll think ""Cool!""  And then you'll think, ""Holy sugar rush, these two cheesecakes are really sweet."" I still think it's hard to beat the Chocolate Tuxedo with Mascarpone mousse here. Let's see, what else? Oh yeah, I guess I should complain about Cheesecake Factory being another corporate chain polluting the local restaurant landscape, but screw that - I like the place. I'm actually more interested in how the upcoming Cheesecake Factory inside Barton Creek Mall will affect this one, because the Arboretum CF has the coolest ceiling ever.

We received our appetizer and it was cold. Then once we put in our order for the second time, since they ran out, he had to come back to our table to get what the other person had ordered because he had forgot. It took almost an hour from when we sat down to actually get our meal. On top of that the table that sat down after us received there food 20 min before us. This is not the service i'm used to and will not be eating here again anytime soon. The icing on the cake is when we asked to speak to a manager she never came to our table because she was never notified. We had to go up to the host stand and ask for her.

The hostesses were very nice. They told my friend and I it was going to be a 15 min wait. It took about 10 mins.. the hostess took us to a table that was already sat and apologized and took us to another table. Which was completely understandable. Ok. So our server. He meant well that's all I'm gonna say. He took our alcohol drinks without carding us. I'm 24. I pulled out my ID he said that was fine. My friend asked for an unsweet tea that she didn't get until after the meal was brought because we asked a Different server that brought out our meal if she'd get us one. She ordered an appetizer that we had to remind him we wanted and he obviously didn't ring it in until after the meal. I told him I had never been there and the menu all looked awesome. I ordered something that  but modified it. He got 1 of the modifications right. He never touched the table again. I had to wave him down for a box. Again, for our check. But what pissed me off the most was that he kept using the word ""f***"" with us like he was talking to his buddies and still charged for the appetizer. If I everrr go back there I would request NOT to have that server. The food was delicious.

The usual stuff like living the dream & eternal sunshine kind of fall into that ""been there, done that"" category for me, and I've got to have something to wake up for. Incidentally, the journey can often be more rewarding than the destination.  But becoming Cheesecake Jesus requires some careful planning & patience on my part, or the carbs will blow me up like a cheap balloon. With one exception. When the delightful Ashley S texts with ""Let's do dessert,"" the proper response is ""Which two cheesecakes are we trying today?"" And we went with White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle & the S'mores Galore. And once you realize what seems to be melting vanilla ice cream is actually toasted marshmallow, you'll think ""Cool!""  And then you'll think, ""Holy sugar rush, these two cheesecakes are really sweet."" I still think it's hard to beat the Chocolate Tuxedo with Mascarpone mousse here. Let's see, what else? Oh yeah, I guess I should complain about Cheesecake Factory being another corporate chain polluting the local restaurant landscape, but screw that - I like the place. I'm actually more interested in how the upcoming Cheesecake Factory inside Barton Creek Mall will affect this one, because the Arboretum CF has the coolest ceiling ever.

So, if you are on a budget.... please exploit their happy hour.  I ordered 3 appetizers, 2 mixed alcoholic drinks, 1 soda for a family of 3 - and the bills came out for under $30. We are all full, happy and satisfied without ordering desserts..... (Please tips your server for their service fairly. ... give them at least $10) Our server, Brandon was also great. He is polite, friendly, fast, efficient and quite funny. He reminds me if Mitchell from the show Modern Family.  Another advantage of coming here during happy hour, you can actually have a conversation with your family without shouting at one another due to the noise level.

We had a party of 12 and had to wait about 30 minutes or so.  We went over to the bar and ordered drinks.  I ordered the Blueberry Mojito ... mistake on my part.  It was way, way too sweet.  It was really pretty though.  It was also an $11 drink ... a little pricey I think.  We finally got seated.  The service was pretty good from our server.  He never let anyone's water glass get empty, which I always appreciate.   Steve H and I decided to share the Thai Lettuce Wraps.  We knew that these would not be traditional Thai style but we were ok with that.  Steve H had done some research before hand and found that this is supposed to be one of the better dishes offered here.  Oh and by the way not only are the portions huge, but the menu is huge as well.  There are just so many options it is honestly a daunting task to look over the menu fully and make a decision on what to eat.  When our lettuce wraps got delivered they were on a huge plate.  My first thought was where is the chicken?  There was hardly any chicken on the plate for the plate to be so big.  I would have enjoyed my lettuce wraps a bit more if they had more protein in each wrap.  They were mostly veggie wraps with a bit a chicken.   Finally we got to the end of the meal and I was excited for my cheesecake - because who isn't at the cheesecake factory??  I went with the Vanilla Bean cheesecake.  It was definitely the highlight of my meal.   My friend next to me got the BBQ chicken salad she said it was ok, but the BBQ sauce was a little over powering.  I also tasted a Cuban egg roll or something and it was not good at all.   So overall my experience here was - meh.  Will I go back?  Probably not unless it is someone's birthday again.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=40,2.36,3.08,3.092,2.7600000000000007,2.7920000000000003

A family of 3 could easily break $100 for dinner (plus desserts) Recently I discovered their happy hour special..... hallelujah! Smaller menu,  great price!  Their appetizers are only $5.50 - and they are the same size appetizers that you order from dinner.  Mixed drinks are also only $5.50. So, if you are on a budget.... please exploit their happy hour.  I ordered 3 appetizers, 2 mixed alcoholic drinks, 1 soda for a family of 3 - and the bills came out for under $30. We are all full, happy and satisfied without ordering desserts..... (Please tips your server for their service fairly. ... give them at least $10) Our server, Brandon was also great. He is polite, friendly, fast, efficient and quite funny. He reminds me if Mitchell from the show Modern Family.  Another advantage of coming here during happy hour, you can actually have a conversation with your family without shouting at one another due to the noise level. Oh..another one. .. you don't have to wait for 30 minutes or more just to get seated!

They said yes but we couldn't order off the happy hour menu. Happy Hour menu is only available in the bar area. What? People only get happy in the bar? Really. If it's Happy Hour why is in not available through out the entire place, especailly if the rest of the place was practically empty. And it's not like it's a completely separate area.

The bill was right at $100.00 and I left the waiter a $20.00 tip after all it was not his fault.

500,Sharon Y.,"Austin, United States",390,77,160.0,2.0,2016-02-05,"Cheesecake Factory is an appropriate place to go to for celebrations because the atmosphere is warm and it's easy to accommodate big parties.  As for the food, it's pretty much the same at any Cheesecake Factory you decide to go to. The plates are pretty large and the quality is average -- definitely not quality food, but it suffices. The pricing is consistent with your typical dinner Italian meal, so it's not bad especially since the portions here are generally quite large.  I don't usually go here when I'm craving Italian food, but Cheesecake Factory seems to be a trademark place for celebrations. I haven't set foot in one of the branches in a while, I was excited to visit this nostalgic restaurant. I usually consider Cheesecake Factory as a 3-star restaurant, but the location in Austin seems more disappointing because of their clumsy snd disorganized service. The wait time was said to be 15 minutes but we waited for over half an hour, our server forgot to bring bread out & shoved my burning hot entree plate into my hand when placing it on the table, and by the end of our meal, everyone's water cup in my party was empty because nobody came to refill it. The food took longer than usual to come out, and when our server came to hand us a slice of cheesecake, she moved too quickly and the whip cream fell off --to which she simply said ""oh well!"" and left.  Perhaps I came on an off day, but I didn't have high expectations when coming to this restaurant. So for every person in my party to constantly bring up how dissatisfied they felt during the dinner, I'm not too sure if I'm going to be coming back to this location.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=80,2.6,2.79,2.996,2.3760000000000003,2.7140000000000004

73,Ven S.,"Austin, TX",2,24,32.0,1.0,2016-02-07,"My wife and I went to the Cheesecake Factory quite regularly. Between taking visiting family and friends there or just going for dinner, we were there once every 3 weeks at least. Most of our experiences thus far have been positive. Food and beverage is pretty tasty albeit quite mainstream to appeal to ""the masses."" The only complaint I ever had till tonight was the long wait on busy nights, and that is expected and never warrants a negative review. However, tonight was a different experience. We met two of our close friends for dinner there tonight, and took our 2 month old baby too. We got our apps, and beverages ordered with our server - Cassidy. I ordered a Pineapple Moscow Mule. The apps showed up and my drink came too. However, amidst being engrossed in conversation with our friends and sampling the appetizer, I didn't notice for a few sips that I had the wrong beverage. After more than half the drink was gone (not more than 3 sips with the amount of ice these drinks have), I noticed that my drink was extremely sweet and full of mint leaves, and did not taste of vodka at all. Tasted more like rum (mojito). I told our waitress that although my drink was delicious, it couldn't possibly be a mule (even with it being pineapple flavored) and if she could possibly check with the bartender about it. She returned saying that the bartender had made an error and made a pineapple mojito instead of the ordered pineapple Mule. She asked me if I would like to keep the same drink or have her make the correct drink. I requested for the correct beverage to be made. The correct drink arrived and it was admittedly quite delicious. We continued with our meal and got 4 entrees at our table as well. After hearty laughs and chatting, and boxing our left overs, we requested checks. When the check arrived, I noticed that our check had 2 Pineapple Moscow Mule's on it. (I just had the one). This is where it went down hill. I asked for the waitress and asked her if there was an error, since they had brought me the wrong beverage and I only had 1 of the Mule. She was being very nice and apologetic and told me she would have to call her manager since she was under 21 and couldn't tell the drink was incorrect when she served it (not sure that is a valid excuse either). Up walks the manager - CHARLIE MARTINDALE. This gentleman shouldn't be even washing dishes or busing dirty tables, let alone be in charge of managing anything with patrons. He walked up to the table and almost rudely said ""Is there a problem here?"" I explained to him that my beverage had been prepared incorrectly and that the waitress and bartender agreed that they had made the wrong drink and replaced it with the correct one, and that I somehow had been billed twice. This is where it gets simply unbelievable. He says ""But did you drink the first drink?"" I explained that I had taken a few sips of it since I was preoccupied before realizing it was wrong. He said ""You drank too much of that drink for me to be able to comp it."" I informed him that both, his waitress and his bartender had agreed to the error of preparing the incorrect drink. To this he snapped back to me ""You drank the drink, didn't you?"" He then said he would fix the price of one of the Mule's to that of a Mojito and that it would reduce my bill by 50 cents or so. I could not believable what I was hearing. The funny part is that it isn't even that $9 that the beverage cost that I was unhappy about. It is the way this manager of a higher-end chain handled such a petty issue with rudeness and talking down to a patron that really rubbed me the wrong way. At this point I told him that I no longer required his help and paid off the bill as is. Needless to say, there was no tip left on this bill. My wife and I will never go to this or any other Cheesecake Factory or Grand Lux Cafe (same ownership). Our friends who accompanied us tonight also left with a bitter taste in their mouth and will no longer frequent this establishment either. Cheesecake factory had provided us with a reasonable and tasty dining option thus far, and hired what seemed like good staff from all our experience till today. However, like it is said too often ""All it takes is one."" This one rotten apple was the manager - CHARLIE MARTINDALE. The waitress Cassidy was being extremely apologetic when I asked for her name and the manager's name. She said if it was up to her, she would have comped the drink since it was her error. She repeated that since she was newer and under 21, she didn't have the required authority to modify alcoholic beverage orders. We have returned home with a bitter taste in our mouths, and this review is what has resulted of it. Sorry Cheesecake Factory - you need to do a better job of training your managers in customer relationship management - at least this one!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=120,2.48,2.76,2.968,2.34,2.648

We came in here also cause I had a gift card that i purchased a while back and a free offer for cheesecake. i thought why not have a lovely mid day lunch here.What I did not enjoy was our meal at the end of it all.The waiter took to long to attend us and bring us our waters,bread,order our food, cheesecake and check(note different waitress brought our food in the end). When we told him why everything was taking so long for our waters and bread, all he said was it was busy on a Sunday.He rubbed off the wrong way, the way he talked and expressed himself,almost as if he did not like attending us. After we waited about 20 minutes between the waters and bread , we were already thinking of leaving. I do not appreciate waiting that long for something so simple. He then took another 15-20 minutes to take our order. After we ate we waited yet another period of time waiting to take our plates and bring us a dessert menu. I mentioned the free cheesecake offer when we received our waters/bread. By this time I just wanted my cheesecake and be done. By the time we finished it no more than 10 minutes cause we took most of the cheesecake home. He had us sit there for another 15 minutes while he was passed by the hall not noticing that our plates were to the slide and we were waiting for the check. Ultimately I flagged him down for the check. He then said that my gift card and cheesecake took too long to process since they were tricky, what is so tricky about that?!  When we were ready to pay he brought the wrong check and took another 10 minutes to bring the right check out.

The bill was right at $100.00 and I left the waiter a $20.00 tip after all it was not his fault. I was overcharged on the meal by having to pay for a higher food item.  I waited for a few days to calm down before going to see the manager Charlie Martindale.  I went to speak with Mr Martindale and gave him a letter of the events along with a copy of the bill.  He seemed concerned and said he would find out who the manager was and find out what had happened.  After not hearing anything for 2 weeks, I contacted Mr Martindale.  He said he thought that by us talking that everything was satisfactory.  Everyone can have a bad night and all I really wanted was an email, a note, or a call saying something like ""I am sorry that we did not live up to our usual quality of service that you have received in the past"".  I did not receive such a small sign of customer service.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=280,3.28,3.02,3.008,2.472,3.1240000000000006

As for the food, it's pretty much the same at any Cheesecake Factory you decide to go to. The plates are pretty large and the quality is average -- definitely not quality food, but it suffices. The pricing is consistent with your typical dinner Italian meal, so it's not bad especially since the portions here are generally quite large.  I don't usually go here when I'm craving Italian food, but Cheesecake Factory seems to be a trademark place for celebrations. I haven't set foot in one of the branches in a while, I was excited to visit this nostalgic restaurant. I usually consider Cheesecake Factory as a 3-star restaurant, but the location in Austin seems more disappointing because of their clumsy snd disorganized service. The wait time was said to be 15 minutes but we waited for over half an hour, our server forgot to bring bread out & shoved my burning hot entree plate into my hand when placing it on the table, and by the end of our meal, everyone's water cup in my party was empty because nobody came to refill it. The food took longer than usual to come out, and when our server came to hand us a slice of cheesecake, she moved too quickly and the whip cream fell off --to which she simply said ""oh well!"" and left.  Perhaps I came on an off day, but I didn't have high expectations when coming to this restaurant. So for every person in my party to constantly bring up how dissatisfied they felt during the dinner, I'm not too sure if I'm going to be coming back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=80,3.32,2.99,3.004,2.504,3.122

I ordered my normal salmon salad and my boyfriend ordered a po boy. We came in here also cause I had a gift card that i purchased a while back and a free offer for cheesecake. i thought why not have a lovely mid day lunch here.What I did not enjoy was our meal at the end of it all.The waiter took to long to attend us and bring us our waters,bread,order our food, cheesecake and check(note different waitress brought our food in the end). When we told him why everything was taking so long for our waters and bread, all he said was it was busy on a Sunday.He rubbed off the wrong way, the way he talked and expressed himself,almost as if he did not like attending us. After we waited about 20 minutes between the waters and bread , we were already thinking of leaving. I do not appreciate waiting that long for something so simple. He then took another 15-20 minutes to take our order. After we ate we waited yet another period of time waiting to take our plates and bring us a dessert menu. I mentioned the free cheesecake offer when we received our waters/bread. By this time I just wanted my cheesecake and be done.

Ultimately I flagged him down for the check. He then said that my gift card and cheesecake took too long to process since they were tricky, what is so tricky about that?!  When we were ready to pay he brought the wrong check and took another 10 minutes to bring the right check out.

652,Ven S.,"Austin, United States",2,24,32.0,1.0,2016-07-02,"My wife and I went to the Cheesecake Factory quite regularly. Between taking visiting family and friends there or just going for dinner, we were there once every 3 weeks at least. Most of our experiences thus far have been positive. Food and beverage is pretty tasty albeit quite mainstream to appeal to ""the masses."" The only complaint I ever had till tonight was the long wait on busy nights, and that is expected and never warrants a negative review. However, tonight was a different experience. We met two of our close friends for dinner there tonight, and took our 2 month old baby too. We got our apps, and beverages ordered with our server - Cassidy. I ordered a Pineapple Moscow Mule. The apps showed up and my drink came too. However, amidst being engrossed in conversation with our friends and sampling the appetizer, I didn't notice for a few sips that I had the wrong beverage. After more than half the drink was gone (not more than 3 sips with the amount of ice these drinks have), I noticed that my drink was extremely sweet and full of mint leaves, and did not taste of vodka at all. Tasted more like rum (mojito). I told our waitress that although my drink was delicious, it couldn't possibly be a mule (even with it being pineapple flavored) and if she could possibly check with the bartender about it. She returned saying that the bartender had made an error and made a pineapple mojito instead of the ordered pineapple Mule. She asked me if I would like to keep the same drink or have her make the correct drink. I requested for the correct beverage to be made. The correct drink arrived and it was admittedly quite delicious. We continued with our meal and got 4 entrees at our table as well. After hearty laughs and chatting, and boxing our left overs, we requested checks. When the check arrived, I noticed that our check had 2 Pineapple Moscow Mule's on it. (I just had the one). This is where it went down hill. I asked for the waitress and asked her if there was an error, since they had brought me the wrong beverage and I only had 1 of the Mule. She was being very nice and apologetic and told me she would have to call her manager since she was under 21 and couldn't tell the drink was incorrect when she served it (not sure that is a valid excuse either). Up walks the manager - CHARLIE MARTINDALE. This gentleman shouldn't be even washing dishes or busing dirty tables, let alone be in charge of managing anything with patrons. He walked up to the table and almost rudely said ""Is there a problem here?"" I explained to him that my beverage had been prepared incorrectly and that the waitress and bartender agreed that they had made the wrong drink and replaced it with the correct one, and that I somehow had been billed twice. This is where it gets simply unbelievable. He says ""But did you drink the first drink?"" I explained that I had taken a few sips of it since I was preoccupied before realizing it was wrong. He said ""You drank too much of that drink for me to be able to comp it."" I informed him that both, his waitress and his bartender had agreed to the error of preparing the incorrect drink. To this he snapped back to me ""You drank the drink, didn't you?"" He then said he would fix the price of one of the Mule's to that of a Mojito and that it would reduce my bill by 50 cents or so. I could not believable what I was hearing. The funny part is that it isn't even that $9 that the beverage cost that I was unhappy about. It is the way this manager of a higher-end chain handled such a petty issue with rudeness and talking down to a patron that really rubbed me the wrong way. At this point I told him that I no longer required his help and paid off the bill as is. Needless to say, there was no tip left on this bill. My wife and I will never go to this or any other Cheesecake Factory or Grand Lux Cafe (same ownership). Our friends who accompanied us tonight also left with a bitter taste in their mouth and will no longer frequent this establishment either. Cheesecake factory had provided us with a reasonable and tasty dining option thus far, and hired what seemed like good staff from all our experience till today. However, like it is said too often ""All it takes is one."" This one rotten apple was the manager - CHARLIE MARTINDALE. The waitress Cassidy was being extremely apologetic when I asked for her name and the manager's name. She said if it was up to her, she would have comped the drink since it was her error. She repeated that since she was newer and under 21, she didn't have the required authority to modify alcoholic beverage orders. We have returned home with a bitter taste in our mouths, and this review is what has resulted of it. Sorry Cheesecake Factory - you need to do a better job of training your managers in customer relationship management - at least this one!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=120,2.72,2.91,3.04,2.436,2.8340000000000005

I arrived at 11a which was the promised pick up time and walked out at 11:40a causing my 11:30 meeting to be late. What I encountered when I was there was inefficient, untrained staff that need better skills. In addition one of the items on my receipt was left off so I had to get that added, then again when they charged me the wrong price for a lunch item which they rang up as a dinner item, then once again to get lemon wedges that they kept forgetting after asking numerous times (and forgot to put in my bag so I had to grab the container sitting in a separate area myself).

The restaurant was slow, with few customers and the countergirl at the cheesecake display area said it would be 10 minutes' wait.  We sat and waited for over 45 minutes, asking twice before our Korean Cauliflower came in a bag. When we took it out to snack, the app was not hot nor crispy, as we had expected, and had fewer florets (only about 11 or so) compared to the dine-in version, mostly crammed with ranch sauce. Also, the breading on the cauliflower floret was not mixed smoothly/well, so there were chalky clumps of raw breading about half the size of a crouton, glommed on. It was so unprofessional, that if we were eating inside the restaurant we would have sent it back to the kitchen.

610,Taylor R.,"Cedar Park, United States",241,15,1.0,2.0,2017-04-08,"Came here for my husbands birthday with the family on Cheesecake Day. I called ahead to make a reservation and was informed they do not take reservations. We got there an hour early to put our names in then walked across the street for some drinks (the bar was packed here). We planned on being back in a little less than an hour but called them to see if they could call us when the table was close to ready to make our way back as sometimes the wait times aren't always accurate. The hostess seemed annoyed and said just come back in 20 min. We came back and 9 of us were squished into a round booth in a back corner. I looked up and noticed everyone was sweating. I asked the waiter if the AC could be turned down and he replied, ""the ac is broken, imagine how my days been"" and walked off. Our waiter came by and let us know that the cheesecake was taking about 30 min due to the high volume. Then the waiter just stood there and then asked what Cheesecake we wanted. I said ""oh I didn't realize we were ordering that right now"", and he said ""yeah that's why I told you it was taking 30 min"" even though this was before we even ordered our entrees. My cucumber mojito just tasted like soda water. The entrees were decent. The Cheesecake was so bland. It tasted like something I could defrost from a heb freezer. So disappointed, not to mention upset that just my husband and I's ticket was over $100!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=60,2.28,2.79,2.872,2.504,2.5860000000000003

Any type of food you could think of was on this menu. I loved the bread that they bring out. Our first batch of bread was perfect. Nice and soft. The batch after that was burnt. The waiter tried to bring out more bread in hopes of it being better, but they were all burnt. haha. It was okay. I started off with the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. I love Jamaican food, but I should have known better ordering it from anywhere other than a Jamaican spot. The presentation was perfect, but I was expecting my food to be spicy. It was so sweet and taste like pineapple. I decided to send it back and try something different. I probably should have got the gumbo, but I opted for the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. This was good, don't get me wrong, but it would have tasted better with rice or a bowtie pasta. I love that it still came with a little heat behind it because I love spicy food. Our waiter, Jason, was fantastic. He was so pleasant and helpful as struggled deciding on what to eat.

So daughter leaves to the bathroom and I just had to ask the waitress what happened.   She looks embarrassed and puzzled in how to cover her tracks and proceeds to share with us about how it was in her pocket then got moved to a drawer than got moved to kitchen and something must've happened... ya just admit that someone broke it, apologize and let's get on with this lame horrible disaster of a night would ya??!!! OMG- NEVER GOING BACK. Just horrendous service.  Whoever you are managing this place and was there on the night of 7/26/17 at 5:45 PM, fire the hostess who would rather be smoking crack in the alley then graciously  serving customers and turning them into repeat customers.

I called ahead to make a reservation and was informed they do not take reservations. We got there an hour early to put our names in then walked across the street for some drinks (the bar was packed here). We planned on being back in a little less than an hour but called them to see if they could call us when the table was close to ready to make our way back as sometimes the wait times aren't always accurate. The hostess seemed annoyed and said just come back in 20 min. We came back and 9 of us were squished into a round booth in a back corner. I looked up and noticed everyone was sweating. I asked the waiter if the AC could be turned down and he replied, ""the ac is broken, imagine how my days been"" and walked off. Our waiter came by and let us know that the cheesecake was taking about 30 min due to the high volume. Then the waiter just stood there and then asked what Cheesecake we wanted. I said ""oh I didn't realize we were ordering that right now"", and he said ""yeah that's why I told you it was taking 30 min"" even though this was before we even ordered our entrees. My cucumber mojito just tasted like soda water. The entrees were decent. The Cheesecake was so bland. It tasted like something I could defrost from a heb freezer.

627,David T.,"Cedar Park, United States",0,132,102.0,1.0,2017-11-02,This place is a mess.  I'm absolutely confident that the management specifically the store manager do not care about service or quality of the food. Or they have no clue that there's a problem either way that definitely makes them incompetent of running the restaurant. Our service was really slow and the food took a long long  time to be ready.   They brought us the wrong food .  My wife's salad had bacon which wasn't supposed to and my sandwich was really disgusting.  Very disappointed and I know none of the managers care .,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=40,3.08,2.7,2.828,,2.8520000000000003
645,T B.,"McKinney, United States",0,3,,1.0,2017-11-02,Worst experience in my 49 years. I am a loyal Cheesecake Factory patron in the North Dallas area and was visiting Austin for a rugby tournament. Saw there was a restaurant nearby and had to go. My daughter and I sat down outside at 5:00 pm. No wait. It was busy but not packed. We waited 10/15 minutes for our waiter to acknowledge us. Brought sodas and bread. No plates or napkins so I take them from a table next to us. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs and my daughter orders a kids alfredo. We waited a good 20 minutes. My food comes out but we had to wait another 10 minutes for my daughters. I don't know how someone can ruin spaghetti and meatballs but it was horrible. Very dry pasta and the meatballs were dry too. Not enough sauce. Horrible. The WORST I have ever had.  Avoid this location. A letter will be written to corporate.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=120,2.92,2.66,2.824,,2.7640000000000002

It still amazes me that so many people come and wait on tables here, even though the place is the size of a castle. You'll notice that the menu is massive, so give yourself time to look over it. The items are priced high, but note that you will get a portions big enough to share with someone, or last you 2 meals. The avocado toast and calamari are good apps to share. I LOVED the shrimp, chicken and sausage gumbo. It comes on a giant plate and tastes even better reheated for left overs the next day. I also tried the chicken Romano pasta- chicken was crispy and easy to eat with the tomato sauce. The steak is also really yummy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin,3.24,2.77,2.86,,2.958
