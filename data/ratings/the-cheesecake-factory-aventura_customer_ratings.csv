218,Vanessa G.,"Miami Beach, FL",6,35,,4.0,2012-02-12,Well all cheesecake factories have the same look and food so if you've been to one you've been to all. My favorite appetizer is their avocado egg rolls they are the best! The red velvet cheescake is amazing!  As for our experience today the server was very nice but the bread took forever to bring out. I had to ask for it several times. Also they brought out our dinner plates at all different times.

The haters' usually end up coming the most. If you're worried about waiting, then don't go to Cheesecake; for whatever time you spend bumping into rich foreigners, you'd have wasted a well considerable amount of time. It's a chain, folks, it's to be given. That being said, I did experience a long wait, and understanding the high-volume pace that a chain habitually brings, I had no problem waiting a few... a couple... alright, it was a long wait dammit', but I knew the food was going to be worth it. Me and a friend chose to sit outside, and we were immediately spotted by our server. The menu, which should include a dawm encyclopedia, is undoubtedly one of the longest menus' I've taken to read. If this is your first time at Cheesecake, make sure you're good at narrowing down brackets. My sever was extremely busy, yet she still had the skill to keep us contempt with bread and water refills. Furthermore, the food did come out in reasonable amount of time, and I really have to say our server was phenomenal, and this coming out of a chain. I ordered a Chicken Madeira, and it was very tasty and filling, all of which I look for in a restaurant.

Love their bread always fresh and hot of the oven, and my favorite dish on the menu it has to be the ""Chicken Madeira"" can't get enough of it.

The burger I ordered actually came out med-rare like I ordered it. Which is surprisingly difficult for most restaurants. My wife ordered the tuna tartare and the lettuce wraps - she liked them both.

But this most recent visit (yesterday for lunch) it seamed to lose its fairy dust. Aside from the annoying tourist blocking the enterence with their purchases from the mall, and waiting 10 mins for an outdoor table when we saw 5 tables emply upon entry and everyone infront of us wanting an indoor table. There seemed to be an 'eh' additude from the hostest, and the server. There were flies everywhere and I spend more time shooing then chewing and the cultural diversity was lacking.

The food and service is good either place. It really is worth waiting for.  They are open for lunch and dinner and there is something for everyone.  I love the Lettuce Wrap and the Cobb Salad, the Hamburgers are delicious.  We never had a bad meal.

I didn't really think it was a big deal (i mean i would have just ate the wrong order but lightly let the waitress know) But I thought it would have been more professional to not abruptly accuse the customer by saying ""no you didn't""  when the customer said they ordered _____, regardless of the fact of who's at fault.    They should have rounded the corners and not make the atmosphere so heavy and awkward. My friend later requested to see the menu again and they both kind of realized how it was an honest mistake.  The manager later came to apologize for the mixup and got our orders in right.

203,Jerry P.,"Miami, FL",66,29,1.0,2.0,2012-11-20,"We're creatures of habit so we usually stick to the same 'ol thing.  Humus here is great. Love the soft warm bread that comes with this appetizer.  For dinner we both opted for the Teriyaki Chicken. You have the choice of bone in or not; pick the bone in one since it seems much more moist.  And for desert, we always choose the Tirimisu desert, not the cheese cake.  So why the 2 stars? I believe Cheesecake Factory does many things well, but they only do cheese cakes exceptional. I ordered a steak one time here and it came overcooked despite me advising the sever that it has to be rare.  When the steak came that time, the plate was super hot telling me that the runner or server left it under the heating lamp too long and sure enough, it was medium. The server gladly took it back and the manager brought a new one to me. It was super rare which is fine and I enjoyed it. The meat was red but not a deep red color as when you would get beef from a butcher shop. This quality of meat was inferior and that's what I meant by their menu being large and serving it all.  Also, we ordered take out last week and were looking forward to enjoy our dinner while watching a move at the drive-in at Swap Shops. While we enjoyed our humus, when we finally got to the Teriyaki Chicken, there were no utensils. I called Scott the manager and he offered nothing but an apology. Now imagine you're in the middle of watching a movie, and about to eat your dinner, but now you're completely distracted because the moron handling the take out decides to not pay attention and leaves you no way to eat. So now instead of watching the movie, you're scratching your head on how you and your wife are supposed to eat dinner. Needless to say, management here needs much improvement. Or it needs to be replaced. Training is paramount and here it's lacking in the worst way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=200,3.68,3.68,3.68,3.208,3.6800000000000006

I devoured the Americana burger which has a delicious ""secret sauce"" which is a combination of ketchup mayo and what i believe are chopped capers ? With a slice of American and cheddar cheese, you cannot go wrong.  My husband had the Kobe style burger which he said was good, but wasn't crazy about the sweet taste of the BBQ-like sauce mixed with the onions and mushrooms.   For dessert we decided on the Reese's PB chocolate cheesecake - amazing and delicious!

You will also hear almost every language but English customers in the restaurant. We come before going to a movie at the AMC in the Mall. The service is always great. We had waters and they kept them filled.  I ordered the Caprese mozarella pizza it was thin crust, great cheese and flavor. I gave my man a bite and he said it reminded him of the pizza from Italy. I recommend the pizza. The Smokehouse BBQ burger made with onion rings, bacon and cheese.  The burger was well crafted and the side of fries come in a wax paper cone in a metal spiral holder, so not that many fries come with the burger -he didnt complain. It was a great burger. We came back and ordered dishes for dinner that were great. Got a Slice of the Linda's layered chocolate cake to go.. I must say as a chocolate lover I compare every piece of cake to it, and none make the cut.  Cheesecake Factory really makes outstanding desserts. The layers of chocolate icing and moist chocolate cake and topped off with chocolate chips up the side and served with whip cream. I really love this cake! Another fav is Godiva chocolate cheese cake as a chocolate lover I even had ordered one for my birthday one year! My man is a red velvet cake fan.

112,Brenda D.,"Mississauga, Canada",35,67,114.0,3.0,2014-12-06,"Background: My husband and I were looking for a place to eat a late lunch so we decided on Cheesecake Factory because it's familiar territory. I ordered the skinny licious soft chicken taco and husband ordered mushroom, spinach, bacon and cheese omelet that came with a side of potatoes and toast. Order came up to $40 for the two meals plus an iced mint green tea.  The Good: - The wait time for two people on a Saturday at around 3 was less than ten minutes  - We were seated in an area where we had plenty of room unlike some parts of the restaurant where you are practically touching your neighbor - Waiter came fairly quickly to take order  - The menu is in itself a book! Tons and tons of options.  - The bread provided was nice and warm  -  My husband commented that the omelet was flavourful.  The Bad: - The tables around us who came after got their food much quicker than we did. It wasn't too big of a deal but we were starving!!! - I asked for extra cilantro and crema on my tacos but it didn't come with it. The waiter did ask if the request was fulfilled but I was too shy to say no so I guess that was my fault.  - The tacos themselves were pretty bland. The chicken didn't have much flavour and it just didn't have too much flavour overall. I was very disappointed actually. I understand that it's supposed to be part of the skinny licious menu but a little more oomph wouldn't have hurt.  Summary: I think I would go back to another Cheesecake Factory but wouldn't order these tacos again. It's a great place for groups of people because there's tons of choices. As well, the cheesecakes are pretty good especially if you want to take one home to eat later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=100,3.08,3.43,3.43,2.732,3.29

That's where a place like CF comes in: there's something for everyone, because the menu is huge (as are the portions).  It's funny that a place with a name focusing on dessert (cheesecake), serves food in such large sizes that you are nearly certain NOT to have room for dessert. Even if you share, it seems any cheesecake you order will be ""to go"".  Food snobs would not even stoop to review a chain restaurant, but I live in Aventura (basically), and I feel a civic duty to tourists to paint a full picture of my home turf. And CF is really not that bad. There is variety, value (items are not cheap, but big - lending easily to sharing or a second leftover meal), it's good for families, it's in a mall (you'll be there anyway, so if you want something a step up from food court...), and it's worth a try if you are a tourist from a place that doesn't have an outpost (I'm thinking here of my fellow Canadians).  I say 3.5 because I think it has more appeal than next door ""Grill on the Alley"" for the reasons in the previous paragraph.

58,Lambert P.,"Toronto, Canada",387,1093,4867.0,3.0,2015-04-30,"I've been to this particular Cheesecake Factory numerous times through out the years and it hasn't really changed.  In relation to where this restaurant is located it is a part of Aventura Mall at the southern east mall entrance between Sears and Bloomingdale's.   There is an entrance also from inside the mall beside Trattoria Rosalia's not far from the Apple Store and the 8 star pointed fountain. While the service at the Cheesecake Factory always seems to be good there are some things here that could use improvement.  The outdoor seating for example, when it rains there are a lot of seats available but some seem to get slightly wet.  If they could do a better job covering those tables perhaps they would be able to be used all the time.  There are fans above the covered area so I'm guessing they don't want those to get wet considering they use electricity.  Somehow, perhaps protect those tables from getting wet so they aren't left idle and more people can use them. Another issue is the inside waiting space.  It's very small, the bar is also very small compared to other Cheesecake factories I've been to.  Lots of people are willing to wait for tables to eat at this place.  There really needs to be some more accommodation for them somehow so they aren't all cramped in that dim area. The bar being small is sort of closed off from the waiting area and other areas have glass partitions.  This particular restaurant just seems more closed off than others we've been to.  I get that you want privacy but this Cheesecake Factory just seems cramped.  I don't necessarily get the same feeling from say the one at Cocowalk. The food is the same here as it is at the other Cheesecake Factories I've been to which means it's good food, big portions and large everything except for space on the table. One piece of advice, don't eat the bread.   You're going to most likely get full off just your main dish so apps are also a trap.  Don't eat bread or apps if you want cheesecake for dessert but don't forget you can always take your food home with you too. One more thing, this place can get pretty stuffy inside at times.  It's almost like the AC can't keep up with all the people generating heat in this place.  I changed my table from first available to inside just because it was way too humid outside to enjoy dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=40,2.88,3.32,3.32,3.308,3.144

The wait was 30 minutes so we went to walk around. We got a text saying our table was ready. We were right outside so we went to the counter and said we got the text so they told us to wait towards the window so we did. They then proceeded to call several other tables while we waited for almost 20 minutes. We went up to the counter twice within the 20 minutes to tell them we were waiting. On the second time we went up to the counter the lady told us ""We called you, you didn't hear us"" Which after she said that I was appalled. Forgetting about that we were taken to our table by another lady. When we got to the table it was covered with bread crumbs and spilt drinks. We then had to stand for 5 minutes while the bus boys cleaned the table and set it for us. When she was placing the menus down we asked why we didn't get a booth (another party of four came a sat down right after us) she said ""Those are for parties of 6"" even though they were the same number party as us. Our waiter came right after we had sat down and asked for our orders and then took our drink orders. We waited for the food. We got our fire roasted artichokes and they were supposed to be served warm but were slightly warm on the inside and cold on the outside. We called the manager to ask if they were supposed to be served cold or hot because different restaurants serve them in different ways. It took an average amount of time to get the rest of the food. The food was okay we got three entrées and one appetizers. We started eating and it was all fine. Then as we were eating my brother found plastic in his shepards pie. We told the server and he called a manager. When the manager came he apologized and said he doesn't know where that could have come from. He said he would take care of it and took the plate. We asked for the check and some boxes to take the other entrées. We payed and left. Over all this was a horrible experience and something I would never expect from this location.

Went to another table to check on his guest across from us and we waited almost a good 10 minutes before he came back only to find out the utensils were all dirty as well. Poorley washed and one knife seemed as if someone just cut into a slice of cake. So i started to help him clear the plates and utensils. He still didn't apologise so we left. Speaking with a manager we tried to have us stay. How can you eat in a restaurant that has filthy utensils and is not clean.  Manager should ask herself would she sit and eat after that?

I wonder if it truly is the namesake, or the allure of the overdone dining hall, or just the options for days on the menu. Anyway you slice it, Cheesecake works for a lot and the food is more than adequate. This location in Aventura mall of course is always packed. I went this past weekend with my folks, so it was three of us, and the wait around 6PM was about 35 minutes. Not too bad after we surveyed the amount of people I must say. But with a huge outdoor area and vast dining room, that amount of people still needed a substantial wait. No big deal. Once we sat, we were promptly greeted by a nice server who gave us bread right away, always a plus, and brought our drinks quickly. After we ordered, the food came rather quick with all things considered. I am happy to report, and also have posted a photo for, the newly added ""Falafel Salad. I realized after I ordered that I had made it vegan, which works for me even though I am not. I just opted for no feta cheese nor dressing, and added some olive oil. This made for a wonderful salad filled with Kale, Romaine, Tomatoes, Cucumber and of course, Falafel. A great taste and would be a recommedndation from me for others. We of course concluded the meal wiht the perfect slice of fresh strawberry cheesecake and split three ways, none of us felt bad about the adition I am sure. Ha.

They reeled me in with a Mojito for $5.50. The best happy hour food were the fried chicken sliders. There were at least four reasonably sized sliders. They arrived very hot, freshly fried. Aventura's chicken sliders were more substantial than Dadeland Mall's chicken sliders I tried a few weeks later.  I wouldn't recommend the ""Vietnamese"" summer rolls. They must be made way in advance because the rice paper became very white and hard. Ideally the wrapper should be dipped and rolled just before serving, so that it's still soft and chewy when eaten. The pork eggrolls, artichoke dip, and ahi tuna tartare were okay.

Today was the first day I really did not enjoy our experience. I ordered a app. Size Caesar salad with grilled salmon without croutons and my husband ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken breast with broccoli. The waitress asked if he wanted the lunch  portion and clearly he said no the full size as he could only eat the chicken and veggies no carbs. So our food arrived with his being the lunch portion , and my salad having croutons. The waitress didn't even say anything about my croutons so I just removed them .  I was eating the salmon and did not notice at first it was medium rare. First, I never knew I had to tell my waitress what I would like. The salmon looked fully cooked on the edges until I cut it in half. I asked the waitress and she told me I need to tell my waiter or waitress how I like it cooked. I looked at her like you are our waitress. I never knew that and told her I wish she would have mentioned that to me because each restaurant has a different way of making food. She said yeah and just ignored the whole response. She is lucky I am not pregnant because if I was I would lose it. You don't as me how i would like my salmon cooked and you pick for me medium -rare. Wow , just wow. Her name was Sarai. My husband meal took forever to correct that he just had it to go . She never once talked to the manager to notify him of the issues not apologize for the mistakes.  It is sad when a good company has certain people that make it look bad. I had some really amazing waiters and waitresses here that work there butt off and if there is an issue they try to resolve it. They know how to be efficient and provide great customer service . So she does not reflect her co workers that are actually good. I just won't want her to be my server ever again. Also, if it is true what she said about the Salmon the company needs to put that on the menu. Undercooked fish is dangerous and can make someone sick.

I ventured in the Sunday brunch menu and found ""chilaquiles!"" - one of my favorite Mexican dishes.  The plate came in with a generous portion as it is typical of The Cheescake Factory, but it looked like a large bowl of Nachos with pieces of scrambled eggs and a few chunks of fried pork (carnitas). It didn't look  like chilaquiles.  Maybe the item was incorrectly named and should have been labeled as 'Breakfast Nachos' or it simply was a rendition created by someone who has never eaten Chilaquiles.  Either was it was just a bit disappointing.

My entree I had a chicken and biscuit it is not like the traditional southern chicken and biscuit. The chicken is not fried and breaded. The biscuit was deliciou. For my drink i had a atrawberry cream sicle it was  worth it. It remind me of a grown up strawberry milk shake with alcohol.  If you are looking for a southern type of chicken biscuit try something else on the menu. The gravy was divine it had carrots and onions. The mash potatoes had a rustic taste to it. My husband had the turkey burger off the 500 and below menu. If you order the turkey burgers on the regular menu it is huge. Order the one on the menu that is 500 calories menu. The dessert I had a tiramisu cheesecake which was very delicious and my husband had the Craig crazy carrot cheesecake it was very good. The waiter was very tentative and nice so he deserve his tip.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=140,2.92,3.14,3.14,2.9320000000000004,3.0520000000000005

Surprisingly only had to wait 5-10min for a party of two around 5 on a Thursday.  They were out of the wonderful wheat bread which is surprisingly a first. Our waitress was very sweet but being here I kept getting the feeling that we're being rushed out of here So they can turn over tables. I ordered the ginger smash - a whiskey cocktail with ginger, simple syrup and Sprite, it was bright and refreshing.  The avocado egg rolls are the best, so simple but bright and the sweet sauce of mango and cilantro accompanying it makes the avocado, red onion wrapped in wonton. In addition split the pasta carbonara with the sigfig, it came out promptly after the egg rolls. It had more lemon than I'd prefer but it was still good. We got a healthy dose of parmesan atop the pasta and feasted.   This is certainly the place you go when you want consistently good food and can't decide what to get. The menu is huge along with the portions. Highly recommend splitting an entree so you can save room for the amazing cheesecakes for dessert. My favorites are the lemon raspberry, then the coconut, and Carrot cake cheesecake. Again, portions are massive so definitely recommend splitting them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=60,2.92,3.15,3.15,2.9320000000000004,3.058

Food was ok, and service ok - nothing absolutely extraordinary but we were satisfied. We asked for our cheesecakes to go. When the time came to paying the bill, we left what was asked for, plus a few extra $$ for tips. After the server picked up the check and counted the money, he quickly returned asking for us to follow the tipping guidelines on the bottom of the check asking us to add between 18-35% of the meal! I guess this is the norm in the US, but since it's our first time in the states we didn't know and it made us feel pretty awkward. I think a 18% tip is very high - and yes I know, it's a way to keep the wages down for servers, but 12-15 usd for one paying customer (and he probably have 30-50 customers a day) 6-7 days a week is 11.500 usd a month! I have now learned the way to tip in USA, and when coming to a different culture you have to follow the norm, but I tell you.. It is a corruptive system, that you have to pay extra to get the service you are paying for through the price on the menu. Anywho.. It's just my opinion.

It was so good.  I can honestly say that it was hot and fresh and the ingredients were well worth it.  The dish is kind of spicy but if you can handle the heat then definitely make it an option the next time you are there.  The only thing that I didn't too much care for was the Crispy Crab Wonton. When we ordered them they were hot and crispy but the filling with the crab was not too tasty for me. I can't really put my finger on it but I just didn't like it too much.  I've had Crab Wonton from other Asian restaurants and they were really good.

I returned to the Togo area and the helpful staff pointed me to an outlet I could use while I waited for my dinner. Would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the rude entourage at the hostess stand.

My very nice server came, took it to get cooked up for me. When it came back it was well done, so she  had them start my whole plate over. New person brought me a whole new plate but with chicken. As I do not eat chicken I gave it to my companion as my server didn't come back for a few minutes. The steak was again well done again and at this point I no longer feel like eating, but the server sends out the steak (hopefully cooked correctly) in a to go bag. When we ask for the check, my dish is still on it. Given that it was sent back as many times as it was I figured I at least given a discount, having not been able to eat my meal. So the manager comes out and very rudely says that we should be thankful because I got 3 plates for the price of one.... meaning the 3 plates that were messed up and were sent back. She then asked where the chicken on the 3rd plate went, and I said my friend took it since I don't eat chicken. She then said that she would have to charge my friend for it if she was going to take it, even though we never ordered it. Mind you, it's not just what she is saying, its the eye rolling and condescension. Rather than have them toss , since I already pushed it around with my fork, I gave it to my friend. It is their fault for giving me the wrong dish. She then made my friend take it out of her to go box and put it on a plate to throw away! At this point I'm beyond upset and tell her to take my packed side (the fourth attempt to get it right) and to just take it all off of the check. She was so nasty and condescending the whole time, and refused to tell me her name. I promptly asked for another manger who was much more understanding and apologized on the other woman's behalf.

With that being said it is always packed and therefore they should plan for the crowds but they don't.  We put our name in party of 2 10 minutes believe me there is no science to this as they just give a time of 10 minutes so you won't leave. We said we will sit inside or out but either option is crowded and loud. So after 20 minutes we get called for a table for 2 inside one side bench seat the other side chair. The entire evening my husband would move his jackets that he just purchased so the 2 year old next to us could go back and forth to her seat all night.  The service was lousy as our waitress took our drink orders but came back saying it will be awhile as the bar is backed up. We order our food and various servers came to bring our appetizer and than our entrees. These are not timed but just randomly given out. Therefore you get your appetizer and once you start eating my entree comes and than by the time I am done my husband gets his entree. Also forget about getting another drink as that ain't happening.  So the Mojito I had was great but if I want another drink I guess I have to go somewhere else. The Tex mex rolls were good mini in size and the dips of salsa and avocado were great. The lettuce wraps too generous a portion so I got a to go box that was flinged at me quickly so I will get to eat later when I can get a drink to wash it down. After we already asked for the check and got it from our server she thought it would be a great time after the fact to ask if we want dessert. Crazy I know but I needed a drink and that wasn't being offered as I guess the bar is still backed up.

First of all I want to say that back in Chicago we went to Cheesecake Factory often, and always loved the food.  I ordered my usual dish...Evelyn's Favorite Pasta. The dish was OK - not the same amount of flavor as always, and the eggplant was missing. On the other hand, the pine nuts made up for the missing flavor in the dish.  My boyfriend got the spaghetti and meatballs...we had asked the waitress if they had spaghetti bolonese and she said that this was the same dish...WRONG...besides being the wrong dish, the noodles were stale and the dish was dry. We returned the dish.  In place, we ordered the peanut chicken...hoping this dish would be better...Sadly, everything was drowning in red salty sauce...like a soup. The waitress brought us a side of rice to make it taste better, but the whole thing was just a disaster. On top of all of this, we had to ask for bread/water after not receiving any. Plus, the other tables our waitress served also kept looking for her to get bread/water. By the way, the customers who were sitting behind us made a joke to the waitress about us being difficult and she rolled her eyes and said ""I KNOOOW"". Not OK.  We told the waitress about all of this and she didn't really seem to care and denied talking about us to the other guests. We wrote her a LONG note on our receipt so she would never serve/treat her future guests this way at Cheesecake.  This was a huge disappointment for us..will not be coming back to this location that is guaranteed.  Best part of the whole meal was the bread...

This was especially annoying because he asked the table next to us how they were. Then, when our main course was halfway done (brought out by a food runner) someone else asked if we were ok. I asked who she was and she said she's our server. I asked who the first server was and she said there was a mixup. Interesting. Maybe this is why we were ignored our entire meal? Took the manager aside and told her in detail my negative experience and she said sorry and that she will have to follow up with my server. She then asked if I will be paying in cash or credit. When I handed her my credit card, she charged me my full bill and didn't so much as offer me a cheesecake.

On top of patrons trying to enter the restaurant, you will also be amongst the servers going in and out the door! There likely won't be a place for you to have a seat (waiting area is subpar) but you can get a buzzer and do a little shopping while you wait (I'm unsure how far the pager goes).  My experience... my husband and I asked for a table of two and had to wait approximately 5 minutes. We were seated next to the kitchen door which is normally extremely frustrating to me but the back of the booth has such a tall divider that I couldn't even notice.  Our waitress was most helpful. I ordered strawberry lemonade (which is honestly way too sweet but I had a sweet craving at the time). I always request to only have the wheat bread in our basket because... well, it's just that darn tasty!

When it arrived another 5 mins later, it wasn't packed up so we had to package it ourselves and wait longer for to go bags.

My visit was on July 23d, 2017. I invited my friend that was visiting from another country to have lunch with me at this location. After being sat by the hostess we waited around 15min and nobody approached us. So I stopped the server that was talking to the table next to us and sure saw that I was looking around and just ignored the fact we are not being helped and told her that we've been waiting for a while. She didn't even smile or tried to be polite and just said it's not her section and she will tell our server. I work in restaurant bussiness and at my restaurant servers are tought what means team work! After waiting a few more minutes our waitress showed up chewing a gum and looking absolutely unprofessional! She approached me with an attitude and just asked ""Can I help you? "". Excuse me??? Am I at the doctors office??? I just kept looking at her because I was so shocked that didn't know how to react. No apologies that we were waiting, no smile, no greating, Nothing! I literally read in her eyes how she doesn't want to deal with us since we already complained about waiting and that we're probably one of those tables that don't tip. Wrong! I always tip good 20% and all you had to do is just apologize and then do your job. I immediately asked for a manager and explained the situation and asked to be served by another waiter. Manager looked too busy to really show he cared. We had lunch and the girl brought the check, and still no apologies, no manager coming back and making sure if everything was fine at the end. I still regret that I was too nice and didn't ask for a manager to come back to make a big deal out of it. I should have asked what was that server's name so I could mention it here. In my restaurant I always compliment guests with a discount or a free desert if they didn't like something and I can't believe I had such a bad experience at this popular chain restaurant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=60,2.76,2.9,3.196,,2.844

Never seen that, and for a good reason, when I taste it's awful. Picata is in a WINE sauce. So I send it back then order the chicken parmagnan pizza, whatever that is supposed to be. I said let me give it a shot. Pasta on top. I was starving. Two bites of it and I knew things were going downhill fast. So I sent that back. By then 0 for 2, I figured I'd play it safe, and order NOTHING. Finally my family, who weren't satisfied either, ordered the cheesecake, which really, was just average. Nothing compared to Junior's in Brooklyn. 3 bites turned out to be my dinner. Actually, the bread rolls were terrific and the high point of the meal.

We reached out to Door Dash who confirmed that the driver was running late and was not yet at TCF.  Which we knew because we called TCF directly.  We ended up having to pick up our own food and serve 18 appetizers (which arrived cold and soggy at 6:30 p.m.) 2 hours after the delivery was to arrive we had to reheat EVERYTHING.  Completely and horribly embarrassing.  My recommendation is that Cheesecake Factory disassociate themselves from this horrendous delivery service and use someone else.  DO NOT USE THE ONLINE ORDERING FEATURE.  GET IT YOURSELF.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=20,2.64,2.85,3.136,,2.766
