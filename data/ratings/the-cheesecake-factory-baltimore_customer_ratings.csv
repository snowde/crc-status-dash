We got there around 6ish and was told there would be a 45 minute wait so we walked around for a while and was seated almost exactly 45 minutes later. I started with the Roadside Sliders (8.95) yum, about 4 or 5 palm sized tasty sliders cooked to my requested medium rare, very tasty. My friend had the Crab cake app,(12.95) it looked great. For my entree I did the Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo (16.95) a great dish of spicy chicken,shrimp and diced ham served over a bed of brown or white rice. I like. My friend did the Cajun Jambalaya,(16.95) quite good as there was little talking while we feasted.   The iced tea here is some of the best tea I've had in a restaurant. the bread is delish too.  For dessert I tried the Lemoncello Creme Torte,(6.95) wow. I loved it. My dining companion took some cheesecake home. The check was about 100 bucks. Our server Jenell, (hope that's spelled right) was the quintessential experienced waitress.

I'd initially dropped by to see if they sold tomato-bacon jam in jars as they do with some dressings and sauces, and thought I might grab some food too. The girl at the counter was so incredibly rude and condescending. Rather than clarifying and maybe asking what menu item it's served with or something, she acted like I was making the item up and instead of checking if they sold it or something, I was just told no and that was it.

Requested a seat outside, and was told the wait was 50 minutes. Not a problem, the bar had some seats available to pass the time. My only complaint for this establishment occured then - their draft beer selection is very minimal. After a few rounds of beers, our buzzer started vibrating and we were then escorted to our table, a perfect seat overlooking the water. Just like other Cheesecake Factory restaurants, the food on this day was very good and consistent with everything else I've eaten at this chain restaurant. Our server, Dominic, was perfectly attentive and had a great combination of professionalism and humor.

14,Mo A.,"Washington, DC",3757,414,2038.0,3.0,2012-07-23,"I'm generally a harsh critic when it comes to chains.  There's a lack of consistency with the food, ridiculous wait times, inflated prices and poor service.  Generally speaking, Cheesecake Factory can fit that description at different points.  Once in a while though, they can get things right.  This was one of those times! This Cheesecake Factory location is at the Inner Harbor section of Baltimore, overlooking the water.  From a physical standpoint, the restaurant is not a stand alone location but actually is in a small mall of sorts that's in the middle of the Harbor scene.  The mall itself is basically a tourist trap with a couple of restaurants and stores that sells refreshments as well as memorabilia.   Came to this location after the speedboat disaster.  My date emerged from the boat looking fairly presentable....minus a few hairpins and one set of eye lashes.  Nothing that dim lighting can't fix! We entered the restaurant and were given a wait time of 15-20 minutes.  As you would expect, there were several tourists packing the place.  So what do you do when you're stuck in a packed lobby with a date who has more detachable parts than a Mrs. Potato Head toy?  Start looking at the cheesecake display cases!!  So many flavors looking oh so good! We were finally seated and started putting in our orders.  Since we had lunch not too long ago, drinks and desserts were on the agenda.  It was also the safe choice because let's face it, cheesecake is the only thing this chain does consistently well.  Our waitress was friendly and fairly prompt as she took our orders and served us during our stay. I ordered the raspberry lemonade, which was amazing.  Very tart with a hint of sweetness from the sugary rim of the glass.  I think I had 4-5 glasses.  I don't know if I was being drugged but that stuff was like liquid crack.  The waitress did quip about putting me on restriction after my 3rd cup but one look at my dilated pupils and she made like a good dealer and kept the ""stuff"" coming.   We ordered the hershey and red velvet cheesecakes.  Very generous portions means happy days in my world!!  The red velvet was nice to look at and tasted good.  I'm not the biggest red velvet fan because it's more savory than sweet but that's just a preference.  The Hersey on the other hand is likely to be banned by the American Diabetes Association.  Chocolate upon chocolate upon chocolate.  It was really good but honestly, it might have been too much chocolate....gasp....if there is such a thing.   Like any other tourist trap, it felt like the prices were a little inflated but either way, it's not a bad option in a high volume sight seeing location where many of the other choices specialize in highway robbery!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=160,3.36,3.36,3.36,3.0200000000000005,3.3600000000000003
356,Nikila D.,"Baltimore, MD",634,183,405.0,3.0,2012-08-01,"I went to this Cheesecake Factory on Otakon weekend, so all of us went in with our full cartoon/superhero/pop-culture costumes. Fortunately, half the restaurant was filled with Otakon-goers/tourists, so props to the staff for being accepting and accomodating about that! Our large group of around 12 came without a reservation and had to wait about 45 minutes to be seated, which was expected of the weekend and of the chain. However, when we were seated, we realized that the air conditioning seemed to be broken. Keep in mind this is a Baltimore summer evening, with the temperature being around 95 degrees, and all of us are in full body costumes... not pleasant. There were no other restaurants that were less packed in the area though, so we just had to deal with it. Our waiter seemed very flustered by the whole situation, and it took a while for him to get all of our orders down while separating the checks. It also took quite some time for the water to come to our table, which, complemented with the lack of A/C, was not the best impression. However, the food slightly made up for our uncomfortable situation. I ordered the The Incredible Grilled Eggplant Sandwich, which is two fluffy buns encasing eggplant, peppers, onion, and cheese, with fries on the side. It was on point. And HUMONGOUS. I actually had trouble figuring out how to eat it initially. I could taste all of the vegetables' flavors distinctly, and the garlic aioli brought out all the strong flavors even more. All of my friends were really pleased with their courses as well. For dessert, my friend and I split a Hershey's Chocolate Bar cheesecake, which was decent. I wasn't raving about it like my friends were about their cheesecakes, but it was a solid cake.

Cheesecake factory is in general a 4 out of 5 chain for me. The food is pricey, but the portions are large. The desserts are tasty, and that is basically why anyone with a clue would go there. This location gets only a 3 because the service left a bit to be desired. We waited a long time to get drinks, a long time to order, and a long time for things we asked for once our food came. It was a typically crowded Sunday evening, so maybe that had something to do with it. No big deal, but worth noting nonetheless. If you like cheesecake factory, go to this one.

140,Jasmine T.,"Washington, DC",512,100,118.0,2.0,2013-11-25,"This is a very unfortunate Cheesecake Factory location. I feel it has a lot of great potential, but need stronger management in terms of training staff on hospitality. I've only dined here once and it will be my last time.  We arrived around 3:00 pm on a Saturday to catch a late lunch. We only ended up there because the place I really wanted to go to had weekend happy hour (La Tasca), but it didn't start until 4pm. We didn't feel like waiting a whole hour, so we decided to brave the crowd at Cheesecake Factory.  Since there was a 45 minute wait for a table, we sat in the bar area - which we were told - was attended to by a waiter. We noticed when we sat down there was the folder that contains the check and 50 cents laying on our table. We were surprised someone would leave such a crappy ""tip""; however, we should have taken it as an omen. A sign sent from God to run far...far away from The Cheesecake Factory! We saw the waiter a couple of times, he visited several other tables but it took him 15 minutes to come to our table and take our drink orders. It took him another 15 minutes to make it back to the table. Bread...10 minutes...taking our food order another 10 minutes...we were trying to be patient. We know that we were sitting in the bar area, but we saw him talking to other parties. We were more confused than anything -- why would he talk to other patrons, but not to us? I blame my personal lack of confrontation on the sheer fact that I was terribly hungry. After finally coming back to our table to take our meal orders we noticed it took the server a while to actually put them into the computer. I finished my drink and wanted another, but he had not returned to the bar area. I approached the bartender and tried to order a cranberry juice. She was very rude and even hostile! The lady wouldn't even pour me a cranberry juice; mind you I'm hungry, thirsty and very tired of waiting at this point. I even tried to explain to her that we had been waiting a long time, but she cut me off and told me order it from my server. She summoned the same server to the bar area, told him that I wanted a cranberry juice and he brought it over...5 minutes later (eye roll.)  When I received my food it wasn't hot, meaning it probably had been sitting in the kitchen for quite a while. It tasted good, but it kind of doesn't make up for the fact that we received such poor service. I was too hungry to send it back, but we did let him know it was cold and that we felt we waited for a very long time. The only reason we didn't ask for a manager was because it was too busy. The restaurant side was crazy, and disorganized so we can only imagine the problems guests may have been experiencing.

296,John M.,"Baltimore, MD",1,1,,4.0,2014-01-04,Cheesecake Factory has always been a safe choice for me when I want a good meal in a nice restaurant setting. The prices are reasonable and the dishes are of good portion. This particular restaurant has a great location looking over the Baltimore harbor. My Fiance and I both ordered the Factory Burrito Grande which has always been a good choice for me. It's a good price for a lot of food. I usually don't finish it and save it for left overs. Two meals for the price of one. Not bad. The waitress we had wasn't intrusive and made sure we were taken care of. For desert we ordered the Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake. It was very good but very rich as to be expected. The portion was big enough for the two of us to share. Overall it was a good meal in a nice location. I would definitely recommend it 4/5.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=340,3.12,3.35,3.35,2.8960000000000004,3.258

I would compare their menu length to the bible, hence there is no trouble finding something on the menu for everyone.  I ordered The Classic Burger. It was a gigantic chop house hamburger. Served with a slice of grilled red onion, lettuce, tomato and french fries. It was by far the best burger I have ever had. Cooked to my perfection, very tender and juicy. And the fries were also amazing. We ordered red velvet cheesecake for dessert, which was huge and split among three people. Which was also very delicious. On top of the awesome food was the awesome service. I asked our waitress early on if they had onion rings and ranch dressing, in which she told me, ""We don't have onion rings, but those do sound delicious with ranch."" Later on as I was enjoying my meal, the waitress came back with a cup of ranch dressing for me to dip my fries in. They were absolutely divine dipped in ranch dressing. And the best part was, I felt like the waitress actually cared about me because she remembered me talking about ranch dressing earlier for onion rings. And on top of the awesome food and services, was the awesome price. Considerably less expensive compared to other restaurants in the inner harbor area. The restaurant is located right on the inner harbor, so the view is fantastic. And the atmosphere of the restaurant is also awesome. 5/5. Very Delicious. Great Service. Awesome Price.

The crust had the perfect amount of crisp. Also, the pizza was huge so I got to take home half of it! I had the regular tiramisu for dessert, which was tasty although it was very dense. I wonder if that might have been the cheesecake version that they accidentally brought out instead of the regular tiramisu. I tried a bite of the new Smores cheesecake, and I wasn't a huge fan.

I've gone to quite a few, and it's always a safe option, with generous portions and good food if you pick the right choices.  Unfortunately, this one in inner harbor is no exception to some of the Cheesecake downsides, including not accepting reservations for small groups and the long waits for a table and for dinner to come out. It's in a good location if you're coming from public transportation, but a little hard to find parking. (Of course, this is inner harbor.) You get a bread basket with butter as you're waiting for your food. The dark bread is always gone in a second.  The menu itself is very overwhelming if you're a first timer. My go-to's are usually the pastas, specifically:  -Louisiana Chicken Pasta -Evelyn's Favorite Pasta -Pasta Da Vinci (-Cajun Jambalaya) Otherwise, specialties and burgers are good. Salads are nice, but I find that the prices are a little too high for what you get.  Cheesecake recs  (note: I always go for those that are not super heavy, as the red velvet and 30th anniversary chocolate are): -Godiva is always a winner for rich, dark chocolatey goodness -Banana Cream  -The Original/Strawberry -Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake for something interesting (slightly heavy)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=180,3.32,3.39,3.39,2.54,3.362

Our waitress was friendly enough, but was a bit on the slow side. I would suggest investing in a few more waitstaff since it is clear they are understaffed during the busiest hours.  My biggest complaint is smoke from the outdoor seating area coming inside. Now I know it is legal for patrons to smoke outside, but I do think the restaurant should re-think the layout of the outdoor seating, so that the indoor diners are not as affected.

This time around I got the Bang Bang Chicken amd Shrimp entree. Wasn't that big of a fan of it though. The sauce with the rice was flavorful but the chicken and shrimp itself were pretty bland and a little tough. I also had a Pina Colada which I enjoued even though I don't like alcohol all that much. My friends ordered Filet Mignon, Buffalo Wings, and the Lemon Garlic Shrimp from the Skinnylicious menu. We also ordered the Pot Stickers appetizer which was REALLY flavorful.

The manager was far less than understanding and sympathetic. In fact, he defended the server and said he would not allow another server to take our inadequate server's duty to our table.

I liked my egg rolls, it was filling, nice presentation. all fine and good at this point. but then the check came.. and on it was the ahi dish. so we told the server, who took it off. so our bill went from 38 to 30 and change. friend hands over a $40 gift card. it comes back as only having an extra 3+ bucks as a balance, which was weird but hey, maybe there was some kind of gift card fee. so we leave her the rest of the card as the tip, and I put an extra 2 bucks on the table. she goes home and checks, and somehow someone has authorized 36 and change to be put on the card.. which is why it was showing a 3+ dollar balance. not 30, not 38.. but an extra 6 bucks, and cleaned out the rest of the card with the tip. and got cash too. fortunately it was a gift card, and only a matter of 5-10 bucks.. buuuuuuut if this happens often, nightly, maybe with bigger checks and other credit cards.. thats a problem. there is a survey on the receipt, and she gets $10 for filling it out, so she gets her money back there. theres also a line up top that says ""separate checks"", making us wonder if she rang up a separate one to clear the card.

We had originally come for drinks but, they didn't offer happy hour on weekends and a Long Island was $10. We just stuck to an appetizer, the avocado rolls. The rolls were too heavy on the avocado and just too small, would have been better with some more bell peppers or an added texture. The sauce put a sweet twist on the otherwise bland rolls (docked half a star). They were not worth the $11 we paid though (docked a star).

She had her other brother almost on the floor trying to get out the seat. This is ridiculous. Yes, come to find out it was a ROACH!! Yes, roaches at the cheesecake. I NEVER... I waved down the manager and showed him our visitor. He said he would move us and our food. We were standing up waiting until they could clear off a table. Well it took about 5 minutes for that to happen it was not quick, let me just say that. We continued on trying to enjoy the evening but it was hard. The manager took my name, address and number and told me someone would be in contact after an issue like this because they would need to know what happened among other things.

182,Vic G.,"Quincy, MA",976,416,471.0,3.0,2015-06-09,"Quite a mixed set of feelings about this Cheesecake Factory. I do like this chain. They are very consistent and clearly - they know their niche - the cheesecakes.  This location is in the Inner Harbor mall. A prime location with tourists and locals making it a very busy hot spot. There is quite a bit of seating outside when the weather is nice. And if going here during usual peak hours or weekends - expect a wait - as is the case at most other locations. Here's why the place gets 3 stars in a nutshell.  - Decor / design: The place is over crowded with more tables than it ideally should have. Especially the outdoor seating, was simply put - chaotic. We got a table for 6 outside and although the view of the harbor was pretty, our table was right next to 2 other tables and it was quite a mall cafeteria kind of experience. Then there was this whole umbrella issue. The attendants outside could not have the tables covered with enough umbrellas given it was s scorcher of a day. Again - very chaotic.  At one point, we considered moving indoors. But after taking a quick look inside, it wasn't a great idea to switch tables. It was a massive wait for a table inside. So we stuck to what we got.  Food: I don't think I have ever had a reason to dislike their food. If there is one thing I can describe the food as - it would be consistently the same across the board. No matter which location you go to, you know you are at Cheesecake Factory. Given the hot summer day - I got a salad. Sheila chicken with avocados. Very light and fresh through and through. Others next to me got fish and chips and Bang Bang chicken and shrimp. Everyone was happy with their meals including myself. Service: This was a very mixed experience. First the positive. Our waitress was very kind and always around to check on us. Our meals arrived on time. We were quite happy. Now The negative. The staff outside wasn't very accommodating with the arrangements. Primarily the umbrella situation that I mentioned above. This is probably a point that should be noted by the management of this branch. They should either reduce the table count outside or figure out a way to make the patrons comfortable outside when it is hot and humid outside.  For food alone, I would rate this location 4 stars. For the overall experience - the 3 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=80,2.72,2.98,2.98,2.2199999999999998,2.8760000000000003
58,Jill W.,"Baltimore, MD",37,112,36.0,2.0,2015-06-12,"The location is amazing. On the water, prime downtown Baltimore real-estate. Has a lot of potential. I'll be a pessimist and list the CONs first: - The bathroom was dirty.  -The host was seating someone for probably 4 minutes when we got there and so many employees walked by us, none of them acknowledging us with eye contact or a 'someone will be right here.' It was kind of frustrating.   When she returned she said ""Two?"" (as in ""Do you need a table for two?"") I said ""Outside, please"" and she said, ""We don't do outside service. Only to-go.""  I was kind of confused. I  guess it was because it was nighttime. But why would I order a nice, fairly pricey dinner to-go then un-package it 20 feet away?  I'd rather sit down and enjoy my meal with service. and be able to have a drink.  So we opted to sit down... -Our table was REALLY close to our neighbors table (maybe 1.5 feet away) and we were trying to have a nice quiet dinner out.  -The drinks are strong and tasty but REALLY expensive - $11 and $12, which once you add 20% tip equals $27 for two drinks. Ouch! -This may be a PRO to some but was a CON to me - the menu is beyond huge. It's an entire book. My boyfriend and I spent a very, very long time debating what we wanted to order. Chicken A VS. Chicken Pretty Similar to Chicken A, appetizer w/ seared tuna and avocado VS appetizer w/ seared tuna and soy sauce with dipping sauce... you get the idea.   This was overwhelming and I would prefer less options. PROs: -Amazing waterfront location. Found metered street parking fairly easily. -The Cheesecake is AMAZING!  We went simple and got the blueberry. So heavenly and presented well. -Food arrived quickly. I recommend getting your app then ordering your entree so they dont come out too close because the servers do not pace properly. -Jamaican Chicken and Shrimp was so excellent! My boyfriend and I shared it -the portions were huge. -Strong drinks. Service was decent, no problems and I was indifferent to our waitress. This place gets pricey if you add on drinks to your meal though.  I can imagine sitting on the waterfront has to be really nice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=120,2.76,2.98,2.98,2.12,2.892
142,Asia R.,"Baltimore, MD",49,57,23.0,2.0,2015-06-13,"This review is about the service and not the food particularly. I've been to Cheesecake Factory on plenty of occasions and it is one of my favorite chains so I figured this one would be no different. I was wrong. When we first walked in, a party of 3, we told the hostesses and they were so busy giggling and laughing amongst themselves that we were sitting there with blank stares wondering if they were really even helping us. When we did finally get seated, our waitress, who I wish I remembered her name, came over and took our drink requests. Neither of our drinks were alcoholic, all regular drinks. It took us 15 minutes to get those and that's when we knew this was going to be a long night.  To be a Friday night, they were not particularly crowded. We figured with as many empty tables there were, we would be able to catch a movie afterwards. We put in our food orders and waited another 30 mins for our food. When we got our food, my order was wrong. I ordered 'Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon' salmon, asparagus, mashed potatoes. I received a 'Herb Crusted Salmon Salad'. When they sent it back, the manager came out. Told me there were two similar things on the menu and she just got confused. The waitress never apologized for the mixup. Came over hundreds of times but never said sorry about that. Waited another 30 mins before I got my food. When my friend ordered cheesecake, she brought it out and then she decided she wanted it in a box. The waitress walked around to about 3 or 4 tables with the cake in hand, breathing over it and the customers breathing over it, before she finally went to the back with it.  The food was okay, not great, but not terrible either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=200,2.64,2.96,2.96,2.12,2.8320000000000003

My kids were in from Milwaukee for the weekend and coming to a nationwide staple seemed like the right thing to do given our experiences in Wisconsin, Arizona, and California. This experience in Maryland, however, was not a stellar one. Granted, it was busy when we sat down...but isn't this place usually always busy unless the doors just opened for the day? At least that's been my experience over the years. We ordered an appetizer (Parmesan-garlic cheese bread) that didn't arrive until after our entrees. Ooops. It was swiftly removed from our bill, thankfully. Our entrees were mediocre at best. My son's fettuccine alfredo with shrimp was sorely lacking in the shrimp department - come on! We're on the water, for heaven's sake! I don't think there is a shortage of shrimp in the area. His girlfriend's rib eye steak was a bit overdone and was, sadly, fatty - lots of waste to be had. She ordered it because of her iron deficiency anemia and felt that ""some steak would do my body good."" Suffice to say, we needed to make up for it and find other natural sources of iron over the course of the weekend. My veggie burger was the highlight of the three orders - it was very good. Perfectly cooked and with sweet potato fries on the side? I was a happy girl. My kids? Not so much. Being lactose intolerant, I passed on the cheesecake but my kids happily indulged in slices of strawberry and chocolate - their eyes spoke volumes and dessert was clearly the highlight of their experience. I guess the place lived up to their ""cheesecake"" name...that's about all, though, this time around.

46,Iris V.,"Tampa, FL",0,2,,1.0,2015-08-23,"Being a Cheesecake Factory fan ...i was extremely disappointed in this location. We had someone in our party who was celebrating a birthday.  We asked to be seated outside and we were.  Every now and then the breeze blew by and it smelled funky. We ordered an app to share and then our food which included salad and miso salmon with white rice.  The app arrived and we were told the bread was coming. The food came and was dropped off.  No salad no bread.  The salmon had brown rice.  The waiter Erin never came by to see if the food was ok.  I had to flag another waiter down to ask if he could ask Erin to come to our table.  Everyone else had finished their meals before Erin arrived. The white rice was delivered ...we were done with our meals when the bread and salad arrived.   One plate which still had some tomatoes and sauce was pucked up and taken away by Erin without asking if the customer was done ...which she was not.  She had been dipping bread (now that we finally received it) in the sauce.  She went so fast and didnt even look us ...so we were not able to stop her. This is unacceptable and we got nothing more than im trying to get it out to you when we asked about the bread.   No heartfelt apology ...no visit from the manager no comps even though they knew we were there celebrating a birthday.  Not that a birthday customer should have a better experience ...but it was a special occassion. We were so over it and ready to leave that we left the credit card behind.  When picking it up the following day ...a manager said he had it and would pull it out of the safe and would be RIGHT with us.  Fifteen minutes later ...we see the manager behind the cheesecake counter doing all sorts of things ...looking right at me on one occassion and not even acknowledging my existence.  He was on his way to the other side of the room when we grabbed him and his excuse was ""i got pulled in a different direction"".  This from a manager?  Again ...missing out on that heartfelt apology. Dont go there!  There are many other wonderful restaurants in the area that will want your business.  I wish I had looked at the reviews before going.  Didnt think I could go wrong with this chain ...I was wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=120,2.4,2.8,2.8,2.2760000000000002,2.64

Of course with the consistency of the service, food and atmosphere throughout the US, we took it as a one off bad experience. We should have stopped when we were ahead. This was THE worst dining experience the 3 of us have ever encountered. From no plates or silverware when the app came, to waiting forever for food to only be cold, overcooked and drowning in sauces or water. The manager was less than apologetic but perhaps he's numb to the complaints by now. Another issue was that the homeless folks and folks walking by just stroll in to use the restrooms and it was so filthy I wouldn't have let my dog walk in without a hazmat suit on.

We got a beeper and an estimated wait of 20 mins which turned out to be 10, so it wasnt too bad. The ambience is very low lit and formal. Perfect for a dinner date. (There's no dress code BTW) and there's a good mix of booth and table seating. My utensils were dirty, but they were quickly replaced, so no problems there. We didn't get any bread, but I didn't want any so that was fine too. Our server was nice. We ordered chicken potstickers as an appetizer. They were half boiled, and pan fried on one side so the texture was weird, but they tasted okay Nothing too amazing. I got a raspberry lemonade (really sour) but the sugar on the rim of the glass helped out. And my boyfriend got a simple sprite since the only tea they had was unsweetened. The menu is about a thick book long and its filled with sidebar ads which distracted my from ordering. I ended up getting the chicken bellagio which sounded better than it tasted. The chicken breading was soggy, the arugala was bitter, the prosciutto was slimy and the pasta was a little on the aldente side. In fact the best part about my meal was the side order of Mac and cheese - An Ooey Gooey Overdose of Cheesie heaven served in a small cast iron dish. My boyfriend ordered the bacon bacon cheeseburger that had thick cut slabs of bacon (putting down my weak prosciutto) and he recommends it. I had a bite. It was delicious! The waitress took forever to come back with the doggie bags and check. And when she did, i ordered the salted caramel cheesecake to go The meal was around $78 (gratuity tip not included) Overall, the experience was pretty good.

The menu is so overwhelming with pages and pages of delicious options that I almost chose something different about 3 or 4 times before settling on the filet mignon cooked medium rare and I must say it was probably the most perfectly cooked filet mignon I've ever had and I've frequented my share of high-end steak restaurants.  I experienced several bites that literally melted in my mouth.  I regard a steak highly that does not require any steak sauce and this one fit the bill. The waitress was patient with me as I tried to pick a dish that would satisfy my picky youngest who wanted to try shrimp like his big brother and suggested a dish and recommended modifications to fit his picky palate.  I was set at ease to see he gobbled every last piece of shrimp and even went to his brother's side to try to scavenge from his plate as well! We ended the meal with a slice of their beyond compare Key Lime Cheesecake --which is a MUST for any visit to the Cheesecake Factory!  My oldest got a slice of the chocolate cake --which looked decadent and mouth-watering. I even ordered about 4 pieces of cheesecake to take To Go --including the Mango Key Lime one which I will probably not order ever again, but that's OK.  I just wanted to try it out.  The coconut flake infused crust did not meet my expectations, but if you LOVE coconut you may take to it better.

I went to eat with my friend. After waiting over 20 minutes for guacamole as as appetizer, it then took 40 minutes for our food to arrive, the table side service was few and far between (only refilling my water one time, etc.) we ended up having to have our food boxed because of time. I was very disappointed, but have the benefit of the doubt.  My mistake.  4 days later I ordered guacamole for pick-up 15 min before leaving work. I figured it was an easy enough request. When I got there to pay and retrieve, I had a To-go box of what what very clearly just mushed up avocado. I respectfully asked that it be sent back to have GUACAMOLE ingredients added. Trying to maintain patience as I stood waiting, my view of the kitchen shocked and startled me. NO GLOVES...people directly preparing and boxing food with bare hands. Employees eating food that they were boxing up for paying customers. Mind you, this is in plain view of all guests. I will never return to this location and made my concerns known.

As soon as we walked in there was people everywhere waiting to be seated and we thought to ourselves oh boy! We went to the hostess stand and asked how long the wait would be and she said 30-40 minutes. Mind you we haven't ate all day and we were starving. We decided to wait the awful long 30 minutes. I manage to look around the bar area to see if there was seats for us. One couple finally got up and we took their place. We was excited and starving. Our waiter cleaned off our table and gave us some water to start off with. We had a while to look over the menu since it was super busy there. We decided on two small plates; stuffed mushrooms and chicken samosas. The chicken samosa was pretty good and the sauce that came with it was amazing; it gave it an extra zest to it. The stuffed mushrooms was okay, I was expecting a more explosion in my mouth; I love stuffed mushrooms but this one was okay :( We both ordered Cajun Jambalaya Pasta which we normally don't do. We tend to ordered different items to try each other entrees however; it sounded delicious! The presentation was beautiful however; the taste was very bland. You will need to add a lot of salt to the noodles. The chicken and shrimp was okay; plus the tomatoes was good too. The fettuccine pasta had regular pasta and green pasta. If you get this meal don't expect to be WOW by it. We was highly dissapointed! I would not recommend this entree. We literally ate the shrimp and chicken and a little bit of pasta and was done. Now on to the desert; we are Oreo lovers so of course we ordered the Oreo cheesecake. I have to say the Oreo cheesecake was the best part of our entire meal and that's just sad. We didn't finish it all due to being over stuffed and it being extremely fating haha. Our overall experience was okay, the server was very attentive; I forgot her name but she was nice and pleasant.

We sat ourselves at the high chairs which was  not a issue since the place was extremely busy. So we sat down waited for 15 minutes, the waiter came expressed about the soup of the day. We listen to that and asked whats good on the menu. Waiter told us about the few items which was blah, so we went with our choices. Which anyone can relate to. 1. We ordered the shrimp rolls which was very greasy to the point which our hands were super oily. We bearly could of eaten them because they were dripping of oil. 2. The dynamite shrimp tasted like imitation shrimp, and breaded to the point where we had to strip the bread off to try it. That was uneatable as well.  3. The so called - potato tots was verrrrry nasty and super oily. If you want to get a clogged artery, and have high cholesterol go this place. 4. We got there at 4pm, waiter brought our drinks at 4:35. Got bread at 5:15pm. Then took our order for 3 basic appetizer. I could of went to PF Chang's and enjoyed the service and food but wanted to try the hype behind this place.

The service was incredibly slow so I nicely asked if our waiter could receive some additional help since it was 13 people.  The manager approached me and stated the reasoning for slow service was my party didn't arrive at the same time. I went on to explain we had all been there for 45 minutes and hadn't received anything to drink.  He made the exact same statement and walked away. After an additional 20 minutes our order was taken. A full hour passed after our order was taken and still no drinks. Finally a waitress walked out with food and our waiter (who was serving drinks and food to another party that arrived well after us) told her not to serve the food. I was confused and surprised.  I then requested a  replacement waiter for my party because it was rude to stop food from being served after the long wait. The manager came to speak to me and refuse to give me anyone else. He kept saying the food would take a while and that it was our fault. So I attempted to redirect him by pointing out drinks had not been received after over an hour. The manager then admitted he checked the arrival time vs when our food was put in and confirmed it was over an hour. My husband asked the manager if he thought that was an acceptable level of service. The manager said no but still surprisingly blamed us for not arriving together. He became very upset place his hands in my face in a sort of back off me motion. I could not rationalize the reasoning for his tone and attitude, we were upset but never aggressive. So I took a step back anyway and suggested he go if he wasn't going to be of any service or resolve to the problem. The manager then yelled ""No you Go!""  which we did. I am still unsure as to how this escalated or why he took this tone to what is a very common service problem at a restaurant. I would suggest some additional training in customer service.

He even brought out a chef to customize our order! Because of Paul, I was able to have my favorite dish in forever! My son had great time exploring that doesn't send him to the emergency room.

When we were sat down it took a while for our server to even acknowledge us and even longer to get us drinks and take our order. Thankfully my daughters mac and cheese came out fast and it was actually delicious!  We ordered the chicken taquitos for an appetizer, they came out on a hot plate and were comically bad. They were squishy and the filling was very bland. It was also smothered in tomatoes and sitting in some sort of sauce that I'm sure destroyed the integrity of the taquito, but I wasn't even interested in picking it up to investigate.  When our food came out my husbands shrimp scampi was lukewarm at best. The pasta was stuck together and had the shrimp actually been warm would have probably been very good. The plate was screaming hot so it obviously sat under the warmer lights for a while.  I got the Thai lettuce wraps as my entree. I've had them before at other locations and love them hence me ordering it again. The components looked fine, but the chicken had big chunks of burnt pieces (probably the sugar in the seasoning, but it was black... eww).  When we let the waitress know the taquitos were not good she said 'oh, they were nasty?' Umm... yeah that's why we didn't eat them, so then she took them and disappeared.

We sat outside on the patio where we listened to nearby music and looked at the water. Our server suggested a sauvignon blanc that I enjoyed very much, and I also ordered an impressively tasty iced coffee. my friend ordered a smoothie that she is still talking about.  Upon looking at the extensive menu, we decided perhaps an appetizer was in order. I chose the Ahi Tuna Tartare. I've never seen such beautiful food presentation at a chain restaurant and I would definitely order it again. Our friends joined us and after looking at the menu ordered a Georgia peach , chicken Picatta, and I believe a Turtle cheese cake. All were delicious.   The food was so good I strongly suggested to my husband (who had an event at the convention center that day) that we go back, he agreed and I returned with him, and I talked it up so much a group of his friends from the convention center joined us. I ordered the same wine, he ordered an iced coffee, and his friends ordered smoothies(with the same reaction as my friend had the day before). We ordered Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls (the Peanut sauce was amazing). We ordered Thai coconut lime chicken, bacon-bacon cheeseburger, Louisiana chicken pasta, pasta Napoletana, and four cheese pasta-each of which we all tasted and loved.

Go to the one in Towson or Columbia...just so much no.  *EDIT: I can't really say to much about the restaurant as a whole...this review it mostly for the bar area only* Let me just say how bad it smelled in here ok? It smelled BAD. Whoever mopped the floor the previous night must have used old water or something because the whole front room smelled like clothes left in the washer for 2 days.  I wanted to give them benefit of the doubt and blame it on the harbor but as I walked around different parts of the restaurant it was obvious the smell was coming from the counters and floors.  Arrived at 5:15 on a Friday and it wasn't quite busy. People we were just starting to show up for the Happy Hour rush. Took a seat at the bar and ordered a couple of drinks. I'm guessing the bartender who was serving us was about to clock out or something because she kept rushing us through our orders and then giving us a check. (I'm assuming she wanted us to pay and tip before she left but we literally had just got there....) After she printed the 3rd check we had to tell her - ""Hey were gunna be here a while and probably order some more stuff so can you just keep the tab open???"" I mean really that should have been obvious from the start. But the real upset came when the next bartender showed up for her shift. She blew into the bar making a whole bunch of noise and then proceeded to CHANGE HER CLOTHES RIGHT AT THE BAR.  Shirt off. Bra out. Tummy out. JUST EVERYTHING OUT. WTF?? You guys don't have an employee lounge or locker room? A BATHROOM???? Like she really just changed her clothes in front of all us just sitting at the bar.

But even still- this was my first experience at this location and I'm sorry but it was a bad one and I have the right to express that! Half way through my time at the bar the manager had to come out with a toilet plunger and unclog some drain at the bar that was messed up.  ***Imaging sitting down at the bar trying to enjoy your meal when some guy comes right in front of you with a freaking plunger and starts thrusting it up and down right in front of your face*** No excuse me. No I apologize but... just WHAM. Out of nowhere he just pops in with a huge plunger and starts hacking away at a clogged drain.....wtf guys...what the....f*ck. One of the bartender girls was like, ""Haha did you get that from the bathroom?!"" He smirked and didn't answer... I REPEAT HE DID NOT ANSWER.  Everyone sitting at the bar just stared at the guy. Like....are you going to confirm to all of us t patrons that YES INDEED THAT TOILET PLUNGER WAS NOT ACTUALLY USED ON A FREAKING TOILET BEFORE YOU BROUGHT IT OUT HERE AND STARTED USING IT ON STUFF RIGHT NEXT TO OUR FOOD AND DRINKS????

Unfortunately we have no utensils, no napkins, no anything. And the image I remember of my brother messily rubbing butter onto his bread with his bare hands is what best represents this...establishment.    Aside from the manager's ability to calmly handle the situation, this place was a complete mess. The extremely long waiting times definitely wore down our spirits by the time the waitress even showed up. I haven't the faintest idea why they sat us down when they didn't even have UTENSILS! And in between every different problem there was a 15 minute wait for the waitress to return! Our appetizers were a whole different story too! After an hour and a half of waiting we find out that there was some problem with them and we'd have them available WITH our main course, 15 minutes from now. We told her to just cancel it, and 10 minutes later a cook comes out with it anyways. I have no earthly idea what happened there but clearly there was an absence of basic communication. Finally our food arrives, and everyone can agree it was mediocre, room temperature, and overall, certainly not worth the completely ridiculous prices. And on top of all this, our waitress noticed we were a tad disappointed, and she continued the night with the worst attitude one could imagine, causing trouble for us at any turn possible.     Overall, this was a gigantic mess on everyone's part. Completely overpriced, completely mediocre, and a complete waste of our time- a long 3 hours down the drain. I can't even imagine what was happening behind the scenes, but we most certainly should not have been even SEATED if they don't have enough forks, knives, or even napkins.

70,Camice J.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,,1.0,2017-10-07,"This review is for Paul Herbert-manager. Yesterday, I had the unfortunate experience visiting this establishment.  I work for a major humanitarian organization, and I value the treatment of such practices.  Upon arriving to establishment, I ordered a drink from the bar. The glass was filthy, however the bartender was amazing about it and swapped glasses quickly. We were seated by an amazing waitresses ( the epitome of what this place should model in terms of service) named Jayla B. I selected this place as I wanted something familiar to celebrate my boyfriends work accomplishments. Let me cut to the chase, after reviewing the menu, I selected an item that I thought were buffalo chicken blast-which I now know are discontinued thanks to Google.  However, I received something very different. After politely asking the woman (not my waitress) who set my order down what happened to the buffalo chicken blast, she rudely told me I had the wrong restaurant and did I want them or not? I I asked for my waitress, as I do not engage in someone's lack of knowledge about the history of discontinued items in the manner she presented herself. Jayla B took our order. The food arrived unpleasantly cooked and lacked taste ( we ordered Cajun pasta with a side of Alfredo as we did this before). The manager Paul Herbert came to ask us about the meal we returned. Now, my boyfriend is a ""go with the flow man"" and even he hated it.  After telling Paul my issue , and then repeating my cold appetizer and dirty glass experience, he rudely responded, ""The cajun sauce is a broth (yelp readers, please note that this menu item is listed as a Cajun cream based sauce and not a broth) and the reason the meal was bad is because you added Alfredo."" Shocked (as I also own a very popular catering company and work as the head chef in addition to my day job) I responded that the broth should have flavor to add decadence to the ingredients in the dish. Furthermore, me adding Alfredo (which looked like evaporated milk-guess the chef was heavy handed on the whipping cream in the sauce and forget to season the entire meal) should have complimented the dish, but such an addition was not the reason it lacked flavor and texture. I also mentioned that the sauce ""broth"" (whatever Paul mentioned) did not even hold the noodles and my dish was watery. Paul tries to convince me I was the reason I did not like it. I ask for my waitress Jayla. Jalya, whom was AMAZING, took another order for us (please note, I have been here for two full hours now.) This meal came back terrible as well. Disgruntled, we ordered what we came for-dessert.  I asked Jayla how the bill would be handed. She said she would bring her manager. Guess who comes back? Paul. I asked Paul how he would adjust the bill after explaining my experience with both meals, and his less than exemplary customer service and rudeness. I asked him what he should do to ensure I invite my colleagues back or how he wanted me to share my overall unsatisfactory experience at his restaurant. I added that the highlight of my evening was Jayla and how well she treated us knowing we were unhappy and did not eat a meal. Paul kneels beside me, seeing the second meal touched by one bite of dissatisfaction.  This man says, "" I took care of the appetizer but because you ordered a second meal. You are going to pay for it."" I repeated, I'd be more than happy to pay for what I consumed, however, I was not paying for what I did not eat- the second meal. After moments of back and forth banter, he told me I was paying and had ""police on deck"" to handle situations like this. I did not mind him calling the police because I was the one being robbed-being charged for 2 meals not eaten.    During this time, the dessert came (Paul went to get the bill). I had requested the dessert to be voided. Paul told Jayla to take the dessert away because I was not paying for it. Jayla looked confused, but followed the bosses orders- who lacks the competence and professionalism to have the position. When the bill came, Paul told me he was not leaving till I payed.  He stood up beside me, and hovered over my table for the duration of this experience.  Mind you, the ONLY reason I paid was because my boyfriend dislikes confrontation of this measure and we had a flight to catch. I paid for the second meals, although I told Paul it did not meet my expectations in our earlier conversation. He gave me his card and told me he would be okay if I shared this experience, so I am. After this, I will call the Better Business Bureau, write Corporate and share my experience on all social medias for this location. Furthermore, every single friend and colleague will not visit this establishment when in town for business.   I will not rest until Paul receives the necessary training, education, intelligence and empathy to be a manager of a food chain in which prides themselves​ in the customer service experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=20,2.36,2.55,2.728,,2.474

100,Meagan P.,"Middletown, MD",142,136,200.0,5.0,2017-12-27,"This is my favorite place to eat when I'm in the Inner Harbor area. You definitely get the bang for your buck! At my most recent visit, I ordered the Chicken Bellagio, which featured breaded chicken over spaghetti pasta in a buttery sauce with arugula salad on top. The dish was flavorful and honestly 2 meals in one. We also ordered the chicken samosas as an  appetizer (technically, it's considered a ""small plate"" instead of a full blown appetizer...perfect serving size for two people!) and they were wonderfully seasoned, slightly spicy, and fall apart in your mouth delicious!  For dessert of course, you HAVE to try their cheesecake. They serve at least 30 different kinds and they have plenty of gluten/sugar free options. I usually go for the classic original, but this time I was adventurous and tried the tuxedo (chocolate mousse, mascarpone cheese, chocolate fudge) and would highly recommend it for all chocolate lovers! Be wary that the cheesecake slices are huge and can easily be split between two people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore,2.68,2.61,2.704,,2.638

103,Bryan R.,"Mt Sinai, NY",1,7,1.0,1.0,2018-01-06,"2 waitresses argued with my girlfriend and I that this was a medium burger. Manager apologized and took it off the bill but, at the end of the day, this is how people get sick. I wasn't born yesterday. The fact that someone had the audacity to even argue this blows my mind. There are way better options in the inner harbor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore,2.6,2.61,2.684,,2.606
