110,William D.,"Dayton, OH",41,50,13.0,3.0,2012-06-09,"If you come here on the weekend during peak hours like we did, you need to have your head examined. A constant stream of people coming and going. We felt like cattle. After a 50 minute wait, luckily we were a party of two or it would've been much longer, we were rounded into our tiny booth. We enjoyed a basket of complimentary bread (no silverware so we had to dip our bread into the butter packets like heathens.) After looking through their 79 page menu I decided on their herb crusted salmon and shrimp scampi. The salmon was very tiny and no way crusted in herbs. Tasty but small. The shrimp scampi was also pretty good but only consisted of 3 shrimp. My girlfriend got an Asian chicken salad or something to that effect and the Asian plum dressing was the best thing on our table. Pretty solid. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that their mashed potatoes that came with my meal was a 5lb mass of sheer density. Could've been used as spackle. As I sit here belching and farting from tonight's meal I promise I'll never step foot inside this place again. I don't get the appeal. Food was ok but it's not worth the headache, not by a long shot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beavercreek?start=100,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668

104,Kristie S.,"Downtown, Cincinnati, OH",6,19,5.0,2.0,2012-08-01,"Let me preface this review by saying, we were going out with a large group (16 people).  Sometimes you have to go where the group wants to go. We got there at 7 and had a 7 o'clock reservation.  The hostess said she could not seat us until half of our group arrived.  Luckily they walked in the door right after us because we have a 2 month old and we needed a place to sit to feed him.  Once we had half the group the hostess told us that they only had room for 14 of our 16.  We could wait until there was room for the other two or we could sit down and when the other table finished their desert we'd have room for all 16.  We opted to go ahead and sit, but I never noticed any issues with the number of seats at the table. The restaurant is loud, but that's a good thing when you have several kids under 10 in your group. I ordered the eggplant sandwich and subbed in sweet potato fries.  The sweet potato fries were delicious.  The eggplant sandwich was not good.  Eggplant can be iffy and this eggplant was tough.  It was more of a fork and knife eggplant than a sandwich eggplant. I took a couple bites of the cheesecake.  That was good, three of us tackled a single slice.   Our server did a great job of managing our large group.  Refills were timely and our orders all came out right even though we seemed to be playing musical chairs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beavercreek?start=100,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005

It isn't anything super special, and I would tend to agree with others that the customer service is a little hit or miss. If you go on a busy night expect to wait, and expect the hostess station to be a little confused.

While the waitress (Erica) was awesome and knowledgeable, she couldn't make up for the obnoxious 20 page menu full of advertisements and 30 min wait on a Friday at 1 pm. My partner and I ordered the salmon carpaccio, Vietnamese Tacos, and Ahi Tuna Tempura Roll, Spicy shrimp and our friend ordered the Cuban sandwich.  Salmon carpaccio was  served  with dinner plate sized sliver of salmon,  red onion, avocado and spicy mayo. Tasty but too many mushy elements together.  The appetizer of 3 Vietnamese Tacos was supposed to be a sticky bun with pulled pork (akin to bahn mi). The bread (DRY) was similar to white bread, also the pork was dry. I could keep going on...

And boy do they really have both. The menu is almost a magazine and the cheesecake list tops probably 30 varieties. Most of the food is average, but there are definitely some gems. I highly recommend the pork chops, the lettuce wraps, and the salmon. All are great and very filling. Now for cheesecake I'll leave that up to you. All that I've tried are superb.

I think I've read novels shorter than it. On the upside, if you have a lot of picky eaters in your group everyone is bound to find something to eat!  I'm not the biggest advocate of chain restaurants but The Cheesecake Factory is one of the better options. Rather than ordering a single entree, I decided to make the most of their myriad of options and order three small plates: The Vietnamese sandwiches, crab cake bites, and tuna tartare (See photos). Crab cake bites were the most popular at our table. Light and fluffy texture but still creamy on the inside. Could use a little more crab meat, but those are ""crab"" cakes for you. The Vietnamese sandwiches are banh mi inspired. The dish comes as three small bao sandwiches but are pretty filling. The tuna was well prepared but they could have gone slightly lighter on the soy sauce.

We topped the meal off with of course a slice of cheesecake that we shared.  We had the dolce de leche.  It was very light and delicious.  I could have almost finished the whole thing by myself.  We also had a cup of coffee.  This is one of the few places that serves something other than a mild/medium brew.  It tasted like it was French Roast.  So if you are not a fan of dark roast coffee you might want to skip the coffee.  But for me, I was delighted.  The darker and stronger the better. For some reason, the place was really crowded and it took a little longer than usual to get our food.  I'm attributing this to the weather.  This was one of the first days over a weekend where the temps were Spring-like.  After the winter we have been having I am guess everyone was suffering from cabin fever and needed to get out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beavercreek?start=60,3.16,3.16,3.16,3.124,3.1600000000000006

There is ample parking in the lots as we'll as metered parking along the sides of the businesses. Because it is the most moderately priced ""nice"" restaurant in the area, I've been told the wait time at Cheesecake Factory can be anywhere between 15-30 min. Lucky for me, the longest I've waited at this establishment was only ever ~10 min. Moving on, service at the Cheesecake Factory at The Greene has always been above average. My servers never go above and beyond (servers in Connecticut offer wine/alcoholic choices with my meals), but they've never slighted or ignored my table... It's really whatever. The same can be said about the food. It tastes like every other Cheesecake Factory in the country (CA, OH, MA, NY, etc). Mind you, I find that to be a good thing- I always like to try new things on the menu, but am glad to have sure-fire dishes to fall back to.

I didn't taste any miso what-so-ever!  One HUGE disappointment for sure.  I know I shouldn't be so picky with the chain restaurant like this, but if I'm spending average $17-$20 a plate for dinner, I expect a bit more than what we had tonight.  So only one out of three dishes are good, that's why I decided to just give it 2 stars this time.  If I ever make it back there, we'll see if it gets better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beavercreek?start=60,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.9840000000000004,3.0800000000000005

41,Andy K.,"Englewood, OH",69,163,4.0,1.0,2014-11-13,"Jules and I hadn't been to the Cheesecake Factory in years, but when a friend's birthday popped up, we were eager to celebrate with them.  As such, just yesterday, we braved the November cold to head into The Greene and grab some dinner. Now, this review must come with a fairly large caveat.  We had a large group in our party--9 of us, in all, which includes one late attendee.  However, you'd figure that a place as a big as the Cheesecake Factory would be able to accommodate this well?  Well...in truth?  Not so much. The service at this Cheesecake Factory was absent-minded and barely competent.  Numerous errors occurred throughout our meal:  we were brought incorrect appetizers twice, special requests (no salt on a margarita for the birthday boy's father, who's on heart medication) were ignored.  My wife's Garlic Noodles with Shrimp were sent back twice, because there were no shrimp on the plate!  Our bills were similarly messy, with Jules' and my bill being the only one totally correct.   In each case, the waitress did, in fact, do her best to rectify the situation, but the sheer number of mess-ups made the meal a frustrating experience. That said, the food was pretty tasty.  The Crispy Cuban Rolls were a neat take on the classic Cuban sandwich, with a delightfully zingy mustard and a flavorful pork filling.  My four-cheese pasta was competently done, with plenty of cheese and chicken.  A friend's ""Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp"" smelled pretty fantastic, with a delectably scented curry surrounding a massive mound of sticky rice.  Our cherry cheesecake--taken to go!--was creamy with good flavor and a solid amount of cherry preserves. Under normal circumstances, when I review a restaurant, good food + lousy service tends to result in a 2 or 3-star review.  In this case, as you can see above...no. You see, I woke up this morning feeling a little under the weather.  I stepped out of the shower this morning and almost immediately started heaving over the toilet.  Out came my dinner, the cheesecake, and everything else I'd eaten yesterday.   No amount of good flavor forgives food poisoning.  Avoid, avoid, avoid!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beavercreek?start=40,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.9160000000000004,3.0400000000000005

It is a chain restaurant and is located throughout the U.S. This one is located at the Greene and is on the corner right when you enter on Indian Ripple.  What I love about the Cheesecake Factory is their consistency with their food, presentation, quality, and service. There are often deals on free slices of cheesecake during the holidays when you purchase a $25 gift card.  I have tried many items on the menu and my go to choices are typically Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo, Chicken Madeira, any of their huge salads, hamburgers, or Renee's Special with Chicken Salad sandwich. All of their portions are huge and you will definitely have left overs. This is a place to share with your friends and family. Don't forget to save some room for their iconic cheesecake as well!  For this visit, I had Renee's Special with Chicken Salad sandwich. I love ordering this one because it comes with a little bit of everything. It includes the chicken salad sandwich, spring salad with balsamic vinaigrette, and their soup of the day. Their soup of the day was cream of mushroom.  If you are not feeling like soup, you can always substitute it for something else for no extra charge. I have substituted my soup for french fries or mashed potatoes before.   Have I mentioned that I'm a big fan of this restaurant yet? I have almost tried all of their cheesecakes already and my favorites are Tuxedo, Kahlua, and Godiva. Although I have a sweet tooth, I do try to have some self-control and share with my hubby. :)    And yes, every time I enter Cheesecake Factory, my eyes dart directly to the cheesecakes in the display case and can feel like I have gained 10 pounds before my meal. I definitely recommend coming here if you are visiting the Greene.  If you visit during the weekends during the dinner rush, expect to wait for an hour or possibly more.

39,Alexander C.,"Dayton, OH",0,12,2.0,2.0,2016-10-18,"I didn't think my experience at this Cheesecake Factory could be worse. I was here about a month ago and I had a similar problem. The servers cannot handle a 5 table section which is standard at most restaurants. I was in on Saturday for the Ohio state game and sat at the hightops near the bar. The problems started stacking o top of each other. First I try to order a pizza and our server insist on not getting anything out the oven because the cook at that station apparently "" sucks "". Very unprofessional from an employee to say things like that to a customer. Anyways, I decide to order the chicken pizza anyways because I've been craving it since the last time I had it. Normally the pizza is fantastic, but this time I swear the whole thing was so undercooked that every single price was unable to tear from the pizza. The crust would just pull off! After not seeing my server for fifteen minutes , my friend who also got a pizza ( which was perfectly fine) was finished with his meal and my server finally comes to the table. I tell her about the pizza and she apologizes and walks around with the pizza in her hand for 20 more minutes before taking my order again. Finally I order my chipotle chicken pasta which is another one of my favorites.. the pasta was literally swimming in sauce. Pasta is not supposed to be drowned guys! My fork was also an issue. I couldn't believe how many things went wrong. My fork was literally bent at the tips and in the dark light it could hurt someone's mouth! And after another ten minutes goes by I see my server , tell her about the problem and she huffs and puffs about it. In the end I ate a cold pasta. My pizza was messed up. And my server had no idea on what serving a table meant. There's not even a manager on sight to complain. Food here is very inconsistent.

Large portions, tons of options, decent prices, beautiful restaurant interior. 'Nuff said! Their famous desserts, however, are the real reason I keep revisiting to try some new things. This time I ordered a Hot Chocolate beverage and the seasonal Pumpkin Pecan Pie Cheesecake and my husband had the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake. I must say, I wasn't blown away with any of these choices. The hot chocolate was pretty but had NO FLAVOR at all. Tasted like hot water. No sweetness, no chocolate explosion that I was desperately hoping for. Very disappointing. The pumpkin pecan pie cheesecake was good but not amazing. The pumpkin pie part didn't have a ton of pumpkin flavor, but the pecan pie base was gooey and tasty at least. The white chocolate raspberry was incredibly subtle, which my husband enjoyed but I personally like a distinct pop of flavor on my tongue and I just didn't get it with any of these desserts this visit. My previous visit I ordered Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake, which sounds similar to German chocolate cake. This has been the biggest disappointment so far. It was served to me in the restaurant ice cold, so I could barely get my fork through it, and it tasted way too much like super fake coconut. Huge bummer since I absolutely adore the chocolate, coconut & nut mixture of most German chocolate items, but this tasted like a rock dipped in coconut tanning lotion. Not good at all. I will say that my most favorite dessert I've had at Cheesecake Factory so far is the Salted Caramel Cheesecake (Heaven on a plate!!!!) so maybe I'll just stick to that from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beavercreek,2.88,3.08,3.08,,3.0000000000000004

Then we were led around the entire crowded restaurant like the march of shame and left standing there before they seated us at an appropriate sized table that was empty when we first got there. There were other ugh seating moments but that was the worst. Also, be prepared for Pasta Problems. On one visit their pasta maker was down, so no pasta dishes. Today we waited over 40 minutes because the guy who makes the pasta quit mid-shift lol On a more positive note, our servers have always been very nice and professional.

7,Jennifer H.,"Mountain View, CA",0,16,,1.0,2017-10-06,"Decided to stop in tonight for some dessert. Got seated on the patio immediately and waited for a waiter. Then we waited some more. After 10 minutes we asked for a waiter or waitress. Waited some more. Finally someone showed up. We asked for 2 waters and ordered dessert. After another 15 of waiting and getting neither water nor our order, we left. We told the hostess, but were afraid if we asked for a manager it would take too long! I would recommend trying ANY of the other restaurants at the Greene before stopping here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beavercreek,2.56,3.0,3.0,,2.8240000000000003

But a lot of the time (especially when I'm with my hubby) we just want something stress free that never fails to satisfy us completely. So we come here to Cheesecake Factory! This location gave us a particularly awesome server. I wish I'd gotten his name because he was one of the most over-the-top professional and sweet servers I've ever had. He was a young gentleman, quite tall....I hope you get him when you visit. He's great at checking in to make sure everything is to your liking. We were so impressed by him that we mentioned him to the manager on the way out. We're definitely going back to this location! Our go-to appetizer is the ""Spicy"" Chicken Loaded Nachos. It's big enough to share and tastes absolutely perfect. I love that it has both cheese sauce and melted shredded cheese. Also, the seasoning on the chicken is so good! But we have many other favorite options - any other the egg rolls, fried Mac and cheese balls or even the Asian Chicken Lettuce Wraps.  If you want something on the healthy side, they have some pretty epic salads. Try the Greek or the Cobb.  For dessert we always order two to share. A recent combo I particularly enjoyed was Oreo and S'mores. But we're also pretty obsessed with Reese's. The Dulche De Leche, Tiramisu, Chocolate Hazelnut and Salted Caramel are all amazing as well! And if you don't want Cheesecake, go with the Godiva Brownie Sundae - it's huge!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beavercreek,2.72,3.03,3.03,,2.9059999999999997
