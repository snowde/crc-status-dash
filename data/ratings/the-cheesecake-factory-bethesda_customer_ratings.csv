We had a phenomenal server who was just super awesome. I regret forgetting his name and not writing it down, but he was fantastic. A lot of fun but very professional. He made sure we had a great time. The boy and I are huge eaters, so we ordered the roadslide sliders to start. We wolfed them down like animals because we were hungry, but they weren't quite slider-sized. They were actually almost exactly the size of a McDonald's plain hamburger, but a bit tastier. Nothing particularly outstanding, but they did the job they were supposed to do, which was help stave off hunger while making the other couples who didn't order appetizers hungrier. =P I ordered one of the specials that day, the barbecued salmon. It was VERY good, and I'm glad it was one of the specials because I was going to otherwise order the regular grilled salmon. The sweetness of the barbecue sauce was delicious on the salmon. Accompanied by a giant mountain of yummy-in-my-tummy mashed potatoes (seriously, that thing was the size of a softball), crispy thin onion rings (more like onion strings but ring-shaped), on a bed of corn succotash, I believe? Very tasty. And of course, our table totally demolished the bread offered with as much decorum as we could muster. The boy had the chipotle pasta which he didn't seem to love. It was also an overwhelming portion. Some friends ordered the hibachi steak and they seemed to LOVE it. Most of us were way too stuffed for dessert, but the people who ordered cheesecake got it quite fast. I definitely had a fantastic time here.

I love coming here because my food is usually done right, taste great and my service is nine times out of ten on point. Today my mother and I went to have lunch. We got there just as soon as it was opening and were seated promptly. The staff is friendly and always professional when I have dealt with them. My first order was one of my favorites the strawberry lemonade, but when it was brought to me it tasted terrible. At first I told the waitress and told her not to bother as to not seem rude. But she promptly fixed it and brought me a fresh glass made from a different bottle. I decided to forgo getting more strawberry lemonade and went for the decadent Dulce de Leche milkshake (not for the weight concious) I proceeded to order the Dynamite Shrimp with dipping sauce which I love. My mother ordered another one of our favorites which are the crab bites. I also recommend the buffalo blasts, popcorn shrimp, buffalo wings, dumplings, and my utmost favorite the calamari. We both ordered the shrimp scampi (mine with no tomato extra garlic) and that came out piping hot and with a little kick. This time the kitchen added some hot pepper making it even more tasty. My other favorite meals are the Thai Chicken, Chicken Picatta, Beef ribs (which was removed from the menu), and the Orange chicken. We decided to forgo dessert we were so full by then. I loved the atmosphere it can be a little loud but you can carry on a comfortable conversation if need be. The ambience is always soothing.

Quiet, and the waiter was friendly and attentive but a bit of kinda a rusher. Came back to our table like 2 minutes after we sat us down and gave us the menu! Then kept checking on us excessively during the meal. It's like okay, I know you want a good tip, but some people like to be left alone a little!  Menu is very pricey during dinner just to forwarn you. Chicken fettucine alfredo I had was $18.......   Great serving size and it was good, but a little too on the garlic-y side for my taste. But it was very saucy and a huge portion so I took home like 3/4 of it, had a litte later in the night.......... AND POW!  in the middle of the night I was puking. I don't know if it was the cranberry and vodka I made myself when I got home, or the overload of pasta....but my tummy wan'ts feelin too good. So... I can't say esactly what made me sick, but my date was okay, he didn't get sick... He got the Jambalaya pasta which was tasty also, the chicken and shrimp in it were on point.   We got the Turtle cheesecake, with chocolate, pecans, and caramel, which was really good, but really rich, and one slice is $8, and plenty for 2 people, maybe 3!

Now that they print their calorie count (which has to hurt since the portions are ginormous), I am guessing that is why they came up with their ""Skinnylicious menu"". Yay!! We started off with their skinny summer rolls ($7). I'm not sure if you could make summer rolls any skinnier, but they did. Delicate Rice Paper Rolled Around Asparagus, Shiitake Mushrooms, Carrots, Rice Noodles, Green Onion, Cilantro and Shrimp with a peanut dipping sauce as well as a chili, soy one. YUM!! It was a busy Saturday night with a 40 minute wait so we scoped out the bar and managed to find a table in 10 mins. Natascha was our server and I'm not sure if she was having a bad day but she was not on point. She smiled when I smiled at her and she refilled my drink without asking but my two sisters felt neglected as she did not refill their EMPTY glasses. Granted, they were packed like usual but as I used to be a server, the bar is set pretty high (sorry guys!!) I had the Factory burrito grande ($14). I had seen facebook pictures of it and wanted to try what looked like the biggest burrito in the world!! It was packed with chicken, rice, peppers, onions, cheese and cilantro and smothered with sauce and more cheese. There was a side of black beans, guacamole and sour cream....and it was very delicious!!! But it was not as big as it was in the past...but I am glad I tried it...next time will stick with my favorites though. (I packed 1/2 of it to go so I could save room for cheesecake!!)

I've always seem to favor the Cheesecake Factory but until this past experience, I will not visit this restaurant again especially this new location in Montgomery Mall. Our party of seven arrived at 7:50pm and was told a 40 minute wait. We didn't mind as much since the mall was open and we roamed around. After our 40 minute wait was up, we checked with the hostess twice in between to see how much longer the wait would be. The response wasn't very clear but we thought we would wait it our just a bit longer until we threw in the towel. It wasn't until 9pm we were finally called for our table.  Our seven guests were escorted to a table for six. Our seventh guest asked the host if we could pull a chair from an empty table right next to us instead of standing awkwardly while everyone else was seated. The host replies with ""that's going to an issue because we will need that chair for that table."" UHH what type of response is that? Mind you nobody sat at the empty table next to use the whole night!!  Starved and now parched we were excited to order drinks and appetizers. The waitress we had was friendly but as for service... not so great. Our appetizers came before our drinks, which in my book is a big no no. We were all digging into the bread, chips, and dip but dying of thirst for water. We had to wait until half way through until she brought our drinks.  We put our entree orders in and waited a long while before it came as well. A manager came over and informed us it was just going to be another minute before the food came out. By then it was 9:40pm until our entrees arrived. The gang ordered mostly appetizers as an entree which was a huge portion for an entree alone. I had clearly ordered a chopped salad with no chicken and when my salad came... surprise, there was chicken! I informed the waitress and she quickly took it back and I waited about five minutes while watching my friends dig in until my chicken-less salad came back. The funny comment the waitress said was ""I took the bacon out too and saved the day!"" One of our friends mumbled you would have saved the day if you didn't bring the chicken out in the first place. No apology whatsoever.  The food was average and overpriced. The tex mex eggrolls and sweet corm tamale cakes apparently are a hit with a few friends. The buffalo blast which is Chicken, Cheese and Our Spicy Buffalo Sauce all Stuffed in a Spiced Wrapper and Fried until Crisp. Served with Celery Sticks and Blue Cheese Dressing, is NOT a winner. It's shredded chicken and then overly battered and fried, which was one hot mess and artery clogger. After two, the guys felt their chest hurting a little from all the grease. My chopped salad could have had more flavor but I wouldn't have paid $11.50 for it.  After our entrees were cleared we ordered coffee and of course cheesecake. Most of us shared with one another but it took more than15 minutes for them to make the cheesecakes from scratch I mean, grab it from the fridge. Splitting the bill was very difficult. Meals were all over the place on different bills. The waitress clearly acknowledged she had put some things on the wrong check. Good thing, our group of friends were understanding and most of us just paid each other back instead of having the waitress fix it... which by the way she didn't even offer.  In conclusion  Cons: -Service is SLOW -Waitress was not tentative -Food is greasy, flavorless, and overpriced Pros: -The cheesecake is still awesome By the time we paid and left it was 11pm... between one hour of waiting and two hours of service or lack of service..

245,Chris P.,"Silver Spring, MD",13,75,1.0,3.0,2014-01-05,"WTH...NO FLAVOR?!?! OK, for what it's worth the new location is just fine--over at White Flint it was guaranteed I'd have to wait 30 minutes or more for a table. Now, not a problem...and I wonder why people are complaining about parking. Really? Maybe around Christmas time you would. Not now. So....what about the food? That should count more, right? Yes indeed, and I'm disappointed. I had Moroccan Chicken with couscous and onion rings. The chicken had no flavor, the couscous had no flavor and the onion rings...Holy shiiiiite! No flavor. Is this on purpose? Real grilled chicken would have some kind of flavor, which makes me think it's some microwaved crap purchased from Target. (Then again, frozen chicken from Target, Giant, etc., usually HAS some flavor!)...and even I know how to add something to couscous. But the onion rings---THAT is unforgivable.

We were brought to our table and our friendly waitress brought out bread and drinks quickly. She was obviously very busy but provided good service overall. We ordered buffalo blasts as an appetizer. For our entrees, I ordered the chicken Marsala and my husband chose the smokehouse BBQ burger. Food was delicious, on a scale of one to ten I'd give it about a twelve. As is the case with the Cheesecake Factory, there was a ton of food and our waitress was happy to box up the leftovers, as well as two pieces of cheesecake (Oreo and s'mores), which we enjoyed the following day. I've noticed a few recurring themes in negative reviews. One is that there is a long wait. Of course there will be a wait, since it's a very popular restaurant! But you will get seated eventually, like I said we came at a very busy time and were seated in about a half hour. The other complaint I see a lot is the price.

My parents are vegetarians who love Mexican food.  Naturally, the giant ""Burrito Supreme"" called out to them. Only problem was that it had chicken in it. We asked the waitress who was assigned to us the first time we went there whether or not it could be made without chicken. She told us that the chicken inside the burrito could be removed, but the sauce was marinated in a chicken broth. Over the last seven times we have been there as a family, we have received a different answer to the same question every time. Some hosts say that there is no broth used, while others say that we can replace the sauce entirely. For that reason alone, I remove a star. Our most recent waiter, and its a shame that I forgot his name, was absolutely amazing. He was of Asian-american descent and was extremely friendly/ready to help. Food: I personally love every dish I have ordered here. Its nice to see that there is at least one restaurant left that doesn't skimp on quantity. Portions are huge and I highly recommend the factory nachos as an appetizer to share. I also love how there is now a calorie count for each dish. Most of my friends who count calories gawk at the four digit numbers next to many of the dishes. I just sit there like ""I ain't even mad."" All of the cheesecakes are delicious, however I have run into a few instances where they are not available as slices, especially towards the ened of the day.  Environment: It is a dimly lit restaurant with tons of artwork all around...even the ceiling is painted intricately. The restaurant is loud. Bottom line...it always is packed and the great thing is, regardless of how packed it is, I have never had to wait more than 20 minutes to be seated. This may not apply come holiday season, labor day, etc. but still very impressive in my honest opinion.  I would be more than happy to give the restaurant five stars, if someone could just answer once and for all, can the burrito be ordered without any meat whatsoever?

I've celebrated my birthday at least a dozen times at various locations throughout the U.S. Sadly I hate giving only 1-star review, but the service here is awful. Came here for lunch on a Saturday. Place wasn't too crowded, plenty of open tables. The host was friendly and seated us right away. The waiter, on the other hand, was operating in slow-motion. He took forever to take our order. We ordered an appetizer and entrees. The appetizer came out before our water! We specifically requested lemons with our water and of course, the waiter forgot the lemons so we had to re-request them. A different person delivered our food (not the waiter) and he was fantastic. Even the bus boy was attentive and extremely diligent. We ordered a kale salad without cheese and the dressing on the side. The waiter heard the dressing on the side part but when I asked if the white grated stuff on top was cheese, he was like, ""I have no idea."" Uh, ok buddy. He sure as heck knew it was cheese! GUILTY. And I wasn't about to  let him take it back to the kitchen. We asked for more bread and I swear it took him half an hour. I was so irritated that I didn't even want to order dessert. I ALWAYS order a slice of cheesecake. Ugh. I asked for the check. It took him another half hour to bring that out.

To my surprise, this place was PACKED for a Monday night and there was a 15 minute wait for 3 people. The restaurant itself is pretty spacious and I really appreciated that the seats were far enough apart to not feel cramped. The ambience is really nice and what I like to call ""classy casual"".  It took longer than usual for the waiter to get around with bread and water, but he was super friendly which made up for it. He got our drink orders in quickly and we didn't have to wait long before our orders arrived at the table. I ordered something off the ""Skinnylicious"" menu because I was shocked that most of the entrees on the regular menu were close to 2000 calories - usually my entire daily intake. My girlfriend was ambitious and opted for the carbonara pasta (2500 cals!!) while our other guy friend got the chicken with biscuits. His looked really good and HUGE... the plate was loaded with a heaping serving of mashed potatoes, a large homestyle biscuit, and chicken with some veggies scattered about.  My entree was the chicken pasta - gremelli (skinny spirals - I had to Google this at the table) with marinara sauce, tomatoes, and grilled chicken. The portion size was perfect and I felt very comfortably full at the end of my meal, with room to spare for dessert. The chicken was seasoned well though slightly dry for my taste. The pasta itself could've been cooked a little more, but I prefer more tender pasta to ""al dente"" so I probably should have specified. All in all, it tasted healthy and was exactly what I wanted - plus it was only 500 calories!  We also ordered the Oreo cheesecake to split... though I ended up having to take 2 bites and pack the rest because my friends were stuffed. It is very rich and chocolatey but extremely delicious... honestly all of the cheesecakes I've had here have been divine, so it's good to know the chain is living up to its namesake.

283,Preet M.,"Clarksburg, MD",1157,103,60.0,4.0,2014-09-04,"Service: This is the only reason I take off a star, and even this is not applicable to all guests. My parents are vegetarians who love Mexican food.  Naturally, the giant ""Burrito Supreme"" called out to them. Only problem was that it had chicken in it. We asked the waitress who was assigned to us the first time we went there whether or not it could be made without chicken. She told us that the chicken inside the burrito could be removed, but the sauce was marinated in a chicken broth. Over the last seven times we have been there as a family, we have received a different answer to the same question every time. Some hosts say that there is no broth used, while others say that we can replace the sauce entirely. For that reason alone, I remove a star. Our most recent waiter, and its a shame that I forgot his name, was absolutely amazing. He was of Asian-american descent and was extremely friendly/ready to help. Food: I personally love every dish I have ordered here. Its nice to see that there is at least one restaurant left that doesn't skimp on quantity. Portions are huge and I highly recommend the factory nachos as an appetizer to share. I also love how there is now a calorie count for each dish. Most of my friends who count calories gawk at the four digit numbers next to many of the dishes. I just sit there like ""I ain't even mad."" All of the cheesecakes are delicious, however I have run into a few instances where they are not available as slices, especially towards the ened of the day.  Environment: It is a dimly lit restaurant with tons of artwork all around...even the ceiling is painted intricately. The restaurant is loud. Bottom line...it always is packed and the great thing is, regardless of how packed it is, I have never had to wait more than 20 minutes to be seated. This may not apply come holiday season, labor day, etc. but still very impressive in my honest opinion.  I would be more than happy to give the restaurant five stars, if someone could just answer once and for all, can the burrito be ordered without any meat whatsoever? But until then, I will enjoy my favorite chicken, seafood, and other meat dishes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=220,3.08,3.29,3.368,3.056,3.206

Place wasn't too crowded, plenty of open tables. The host was friendly and seated us right away. The waiter, on the other hand, was operating in slow-motion. He took forever to take our order. We ordered an appetizer and entrees. The appetizer came out before our water! We specifically requested lemons with our water and of course, the waiter forgot the lemons so we had to re-request them. A different person delivered our food (not the waiter) and he was fantastic. Even the bus boy was attentive and extremely diligent. We ordered a kale salad without cheese and the dressing on the side. The waiter heard the dressing on the side part but when I asked if the white grated stuff on top was cheese, he was like, ""I have no idea."" Uh, ok buddy. He sure as heck knew it was cheese! GUILTY. And I wasn't about to  let him take it back to the kitchen. We asked for more bread and I swear it took him half an hour. I was so irritated that I didn't even want to order dessert.

563,Katie W.,"Damascus, United States",2,19,,5.0,2014-12-03,"Yum yum yum yum! My husband and I visited on a Saturday night at peak time. We were given a buzzer and told there was a wait, which we were expecting. So we went to the bar and enjoyed some drinks, which we finished just before the buzzer went off. We were brought to our table and our friendly waitress brought out bread and drinks quickly. She was obviously very busy but provided good service overall. We ordered buffalo blasts as an appetizer. For our entrees, I ordered the chicken Marsala and my husband chose the smokehouse BBQ burger. Food was delicious, on a scale of one to ten I'd give it about a twelve. As is the case with the Cheesecake Factory, there was a ton of food and our waitress was happy to box up the leftovers, as well as two pieces of cheesecake (Oreo and s'mores), which we enjoyed the following day. I've noticed a few recurring themes in negative reviews. One is that there is a long wait. Of course there will be a wait, since it's a very popular restaurant! But you will get seated eventually, like I said we came at a very busy time and were seated in about a half hour. The other complaint I see a lot is the price. But considering the portion sizes it's not that bad, you will almost certainly have enough for leftovers so you're really getting two meals out of it, of superb food!

We got it as carry out, so we couldn't really say anything. It was unbearable to eat. The cheesecake was excellent. After a few additional times visiting Cheesecake Factory, and reordering their pasta - its back to normal and not the salty dish that we first got when we went there. My favorite pasta at Cheesecake Factory is their Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. I also enjoy the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. The portion is large enough to make me full and is really sauce and great with their brown bread.

340,Erin W.,"Gaithersburg, United States",89,204,27.0,3.0,2015-03-08,"What can I say about the Cheesecake Factory that hasn't been said before. Quick, starch and salt filled food, expensive drinks, and slices of cheesecake which contain more calories than an average adult needs in a week. There is nothing about this location that is any different than any other location except for that it's at Montgomery Mall rather than Anymall USA.  Decent place for a girls night out if you feel like treating yourself to martinis and cheesecake. Okay place if you're in high school and want to go on a ""fancy"" date. Expect a lot of noise, people with massive amounts of shopping bags and to leave feeling full, bloated, and probably a little worse about yourself after consuming a 5000 calorie meal.

136,Lea K.,"Clarksburg, MD",12,7,4.0,2.0,2015-03-11,"I'm writing this review a month late because I wanted to give this restaurant the benefit of the doubt.  I loved the Cheesecake Factory when it was located in White Flint.  I used to be one of those crazy people that would wait 2-3 hours for a table.  I used to also order to go when I couldn't wait in those lines.   Now for my recent experience.  On New Year's Eve, I ordered to go.  I drove 30 minutes to Montgomery Mall to pick up my food.  When I got there, the individual that brought my food out told me that my cheesecake was not quite ready since they had to put strawberries on it.  I waited an additional 10 minutes and even tipped the server  extra for bringing my food out to my car.  Because it took so long for my cheesecake to come out, I did not check it.  When I got home, I opened the box only to find a frozen cheesecake without any of the toppings they were supposedly putting on it while I wait an extra 10 minutes.  I called the restaurant and the manager was kind enough to give us a cheesecake for my husband to pick up on his way home without making us bring back the other.   Fast forward to February 14th, my husband picked up food for Valentine's Day so we can have a nice dinner in with our kids.  Again, Cheesecake made a mistake with our order.  They charged us for a dessert item but did not include it in the bag.  I called the manager and she took down my address and name and told me she would be sending us a gift card in place of the dessert.  I thanked her and waited for the gift card. It's now been a month and no gift card.  My low rating is for the poor customer service at the counter when we picked up the food, the mistakes with the dessert, and finally for the lack of the manager following through on her promise to send us a gift card.  I can honestly say I will never order take out from Cheesecake again and probably would not set foot into their restaurant.  I no longer have the patience to wait 2-3 hours for a seat in a restaurant that does not take care of its customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=120,3.12,3.1,3.36,1.9920000000000002,3.1080000000000005

Decent place for a girls night out if you feel like treating yourself to martinis and cheesecake. Okay place if you're in high school and want to go on a ""fancy"" date. Expect a lot of noise, people with massive amounts of shopping bags and to leave feeling full, bloated, and probably a little worse about yourself after consuming a 5000 calorie meal.

It's now been a month and no gift card.  My low rating is for the poor customer service at the counter when we picked up the food, the mistakes with the dessert, and finally for the lack of the manager following through on her promise to send us a gift card.  I can honestly say I will never order take out from Cheesecake again and probably would not set foot into their restaurant.  I no longer have the patience to wait 2-3 hours for a seat in a restaurant that does not take care of its customers.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=120,3.2,2.9,3.14,2.504,3.0200000000000005

Instead she again in an even ruder voice said ""I'm helping someone else"". So we left.

I'm not trying to harp on the CF; it's a good place to go for some American chain restaurant dining, even if you're going there ""ironically"" like my friend and I were. Anyway, our experience: Walked in the and the hostess said hi and just stared at us, I'm not kidding. After a few awkward seconds, I asked for a table for two and she led us. Weird, but whatever. Our server, whose name we never got, didn't even bring us drinks (when we just wanted water) until after he had brought us our bread basket. The sweet brown bread was delicious, but the white bread was rather stale. He then took our orders, and our food was brought out within reasonable time by a different server who set it down and left. My friend ordered macaroni and cheese and was brought the fried macaroni and cheese balls appetizer. I ordered the Skinnylicious lemon garlic shrimp and asked for a side of vegetables instead of the pasta, but was instead brought a bowl of lettuce. As a former server I completely understand mix ups happen, but it was frustrating because if our server himself had brought us the food (instead of shmoozing with the table of girls next to us, which he was doing all night), he could have attended to it right away. When he saw us with our food he came over and right away pointed to my bowl of lettuce and said ""That's not a side of vegetables"" and picked it up to take it back. My friend is very shy and I knew wasn't going to say anything so I went ahead for her and let him know that she wanted mac and cheese, not the fried MC app. His response was ""Well, that's not what you were pointing to on the menu"", which kind of took me back - not how a server should respond. We both just kind of looked at him and he said ""Well, I can put in mac and cheese, but that's going to take a while"", and my friend said the app was fine, but I was pretty put off by that.

The MC balls were good but we were very unhappy with how he handled the whole thing. Also, if you go to CF, don't order off the Skinnylicious menu. I paid 17 dollars for six tiny pieces of shrimp and asparagus. It's not worth it - make CF your cheat meal, don't try to be healthy there. Lesson learned.

452,Amanda I.,"Cabin John, United States",21,87,120.0,4.0,2016-02-20,"Recently I have just been getting desserts here! The service depends on the server, I come pretty late at night so they sometimes rush me. Some servers are really friendly, I had one that was more on the rude side.. My friend always gets coffee and it is always hot, which is obviously good.  I have gotten Linda's fudge cake, this is super moist and served with three dollops of whipped cream. It has a rich chocolate ganache frosting on top and layered in between, I do wish there was more between though. There is a thin layer of the ganache on the backside of the cake too and this part is covered in chocolate chips, which add a nice crunch. I would definitely recommend this cake to someone looking for chocolate cake here. My personal favorite dessert here so far is the Godiva fudge brownie sundae. This comes with 3 triangles of rich fudge like brownie, 2 scoops of ice cream with dollops of whipped cream on top, some fudge sauce and 2 chocolate squares. I love how big this dessert is! I do eat the whole thing by myself (I have a very big sweet tooth!) but it could definitely be shared with 2 or 3 people... probably more but I wouldn't share with more than one lol. I love that the brownie is so dense and fudgy and the vanilla ice cream goes so well with it, I am drooling now.... I got the pumpkin cheesecake. The texture was good and the crust was nice and crisp. There was a big dollop of whipped cream on top and on the plate that went well with the smooth cheesecake. My problem with this was the size, compared to the brownie sundae it is significantly smaller and I didn't feel satisfied after. But this is coming from a sweetaholic. The apple crumble is big topped with ice cream and whipped cream. The crumble part is really good when it mixes with the apple ""goo"" it almost has a cake batter texture and there are also walnuts in there to keep some crunch. However I thought this dessert was a little too sweet, I would not be able to eat half of it because of that.  Let's talk about some savory food! Pasta da vinci is super yum! This is probably my favorite dish here. It is penne pasta tossed in a madeira wine sauce that is super creamy and decadent and it has 2 kinds of mushrooms in the dish as well as chicken. This is a very hearty and comfort food meal that I love! The Chicken stuffed tortillas are also good, however sometimes inconsistent. I have gotten these probably 3 times and once there was barely any chicken in the tortillas and then another time they were more stuffed with chicken. This comes with a corn cake that is very good (we usually ask for extra!) The cake is a little sweet and crisp on the outside from the grill and soft on the inside- these never disappoint! They also come with a tomatillo sauce, which we get more of this too because it adds a ton of flavor. It is a little tart and tangy I would say. The tortillas come with a huge side of black beans. The BBQ ranch chicken salad is not the best salad. It comes with a lot of different things on top, but there wasn't enough of any of them to make the salad make sense. It almost felt like there was too much going on and not enough of any one thing. The toppings are split up into sections. So there was chicken in one section with the BBQ topping. The chicken when I got the salad was dry, so that was disappointing. There was a small amount of tomato, corn and beans in the salad (which I never thought I would use small describing a cheesecake factory dish!) And then on top of everything were these thin cut fried onions, there were a lot of the onions and they were really good, but I wish everything else had more too.  The Chinese chicken salad is pretty good. The dressing is delicious and I like the addition of the mandarin oranges and slivered almonds for some crunch. The salad has way too many of the crisp rice noodles that taste like Styrofoam. Other than the noodles I would say this is one of the better salads here. The tossed greens salad is actually good for being so simple. It is just lettuce, tomato, cucumber, sliced zucchini and sliced beets. You get to choose your dressing and we usually get the skinnylicious balsamic, which has a lot of flavor for being a skinny dressing. I like this simple salad as an accompaniment to an entrée.  The cheese pizza is one star- it tastes like one of those fake cheese pizzas from my childhood. The cheese is cheap tasting. The marinara is ok (we sometimes get charged $2 for an extra small side of marinara and sometimes don't). I would not recommend the cheese pizza here. However, the bbq chicken pizza is on point! This pizza has the right amount of bbq as the sauce and a good amount of cheese and chicken. While it is probably the same cheese they use on the original cheese pizza it must go better with the tangy bbq and chicken. I have gotten this a few times and would get it again!

214,Amanda I.,"Cabin John, MD",21,87,120.0,4.0,2016-02-20,"Recently I have just been getting desserts here! The service depends on the server, I come pretty late at night so they sometimes rush me. Some servers are really friendly, I had one that was more on the rude side.. My friend always gets coffee and it is always hot, which is obviously good.  I have gotten Linda's fudge cake, this is super moist and served with three dollops of whipped cream. It has a rich chocolate ganache frosting on top and layered in between, I do wish there was more between though. There is a thin layer of the ganache on the backside of the cake too and this part is covered in chocolate chips, which add a nice crunch. I would definitely recommend this cake to someone looking for chocolate cake here. My personal favorite dessert here so far is the Godiva fudge brownie sundae. This comes with 3 triangles of rich fudge like brownie, 2 scoops of ice cream with dollops of whipped cream on top, some fudge sauce and 2 chocolate squares. I love how big this dessert is! I do eat the whole thing by myself (I have a very big sweet tooth!) but it could definitely be shared with 2 or 3 people... probably more but I wouldn't share with more than one lol. I love that the brownie is so dense and fudgy and the vanilla ice cream goes so well with it, I am drooling now.... I got the pumpkin cheesecake. The texture was good and the crust was nice and crisp. There was a big dollop of whipped cream on top and on the plate that went well with the smooth cheesecake. My problem with this was the size, compared to the brownie sundae it is significantly smaller and I didn't feel satisfied after. But this is coming from a sweetaholic. The apple crumble is big topped with ice cream and whipped cream. The crumble part is really good when it mixes with the apple ""goo"" it almost has a cake batter texture and there are also walnuts in there to keep some crunch. However I thought this dessert was a little too sweet, I would not be able to eat half of it because of that.  Let's talk about some savory food! Pasta da vinci is super yum! This is probably my favorite dish here. It is penne pasta tossed in a madeira wine sauce that is super creamy and decadent and it has 2 kinds of mushrooms in the dish as well as chicken. This is a very hearty and comfort food meal that I love! The Chicken stuffed tortillas are also good, however sometimes inconsistent. I have gotten these probably 3 times and once there was barely any chicken in the tortillas and then another time they were more stuffed with chicken. This comes with a corn cake that is very good (we usually ask for extra!) The cake is a little sweet and crisp on the outside from the grill and soft on the inside- these never disappoint! They also come with a tomatillo sauce, which we get more of this too because it adds a ton of flavor. It is a little tart and tangy I would say. The tortillas come with a huge side of black beans. The BBQ ranch chicken salad is not the best salad. It comes with a lot of different things on top, but there wasn't enough of any of them to make the salad make sense. It almost felt like there was too much going on and not enough of any one thing. The toppings are split up into sections. So there was chicken in one section with the BBQ topping.

I asked the lady who placed my order for the bread and she rolled her eyes at me.  15 minute wait time was quoted but I waited longer for my food... which wasn't too bad  I drive all the way back to work & open my salad and find 3-4 pieces of bacon in it.  I didn't order any meat and there shouldn't have been any mix up or traces of other food mixed into my salad.  Also, the salad was not so big- it was packed into a large dinner size container with a large bag....wasn't necessary.  1 star for the host who greated me & 1 star for the 3 extra things of butter she threw into my over sized bag, along with the salad being 80% lettuce -------this is why I need extra dressing !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=120,3.44,3.03,3.048,2.8880000000000003,3.194

It's usually my family's choice of restaurant to go in any kind of occasion. We do obviously try new things,  but whenever we don't feel like thinking about when and where too much, we pick here. It usually has a waiting time of 30-50 minutes so it's better to go from 3:30-6pm when it's not that full and you'll get a more calmer experience. And of course, the cheesecake is brilliant.

Andrew is the manager of a sales team, and as a team dinner we decided to all head over to the restaurant. We had a party of about 15. Everything about dinner was great, the food and the service were wonderful, or so we thought. When the check came around, it was about $77 for the whole meal. Including a $14 tip for the waitress, the total came out to about $91. We put $70 in cash into the check holder along with a debit card to cover the remaining balance of about $21.  I thought that this was common knowledge, seeing as how I have worked in my fair share of restaurants, that when both cash and a card are put into the check holder it means to use the cash first and then put the remaining balance onto the card- but if the waitress had any questions about this we would certainly be more than happy to clarify that for her. She had no questions and brought us back the receipt. Andrew did not realize that she had charged him the ENTIRE $91 onto his card AND also taken the cash. That is the problem.  If she would have charged the card for the whole thing and given our cash back, things would be just peachy but she did not.  Andrew did not notice that he was charged for the whole thing until yesterday (Wednesday 6/22). He called the store and the general manager, Liz, told us that he signed a legal binding document agreeing to be charged $91. That is fine. But give us back our cash. To this she responded, ""Well we have no way of proving that there was any cash taken by the server. We will call and ask her and its basically her word against yours"". That is absolutely ridiculous. Yes, we should have been paying a bit more attention at the time and noticed then, but the nature of the  response we have received and lack of any customer service what so ever is appalling to me. I do not see how it is difficult to check the logs which, I would assume must be kept when each drawer is counted out each night and see if that particular drawer was over $70. She has not even given us the courtesy of checking back to that day and seeing if there was any mysterious extra cash anywhere in the restaurant. And if that drawer was not over at all, maybe you have the bigger issue of a waitress that is stealing from the customers. Liz has basically told us ""sorry, but your stupidity lost you $70 to us"". She claims that she called the waitress that rang up our bill, but the waitress has not called back. I'm sorry but that is not my problem.

So the server then gets his manager (Amos), who said the same exact thing the server said ""we strained the pineapple juice because you didn't want ice"". We felt so insulted.

438,Sharon W.,"Silver Spring, United States",86,367,,3.0,2016-07-09,"Previously, I rated The Cheesecake Factory based on the D.C. and White Flint locations and only gave it one star. Recently I met friends for lunch in Bethesda at The Cheesecake Factory now located in Montgomery Mall (my friends' choice). The restaurant is easy to locate and has plenty of parking within easy walking distance. There is also valet parking for a nominal fee, and they'll stamp your ticket in the restaurant. The ambiance at this location is much nicer to me than at the previous location. It appears to be larger and the seating seems more spread out. It's still noisy, but 5 of use had no trouble conversing. One of the best parts of the visit was our server, Scott. I can't imagine what he thought when he saw our table of five 50 years+ women. He was great though, and even offered to split our checks without our asking. It was a little hard for me to find something that fit into my diet, but I settled on a small Greek salad. It was decent, but nothing really too special. The crab cake that another guest at our table ordered just looked okay and I noticed she didn't ask to have the leftover boxed to take home.  Since Montgomery Mall is a convenient place to meet friends in the Bethesda area, and we had a pleasant experience at this location, I'd actually suggest it myself as a nice place for lunch.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=40,3.56,3.3,3.124,2.2199999999999998,3.4040000000000004

Our server came by around 5:45 and I told her we were ready to order.. She asked us what we wanted to drink and she walked away and came back with our water. Then she immediately took off and was nowhere to be found for 15 minutes. At 6pm, we flagged down a manager who took our order. I told him it had already been 15-20 minutes and I didn't feel like waiting forever for my food due to the wait. After all.. I came prepared.  The food came out at 6:12 and that's when our server reappeared out of thin air. We asked her for more brown bread and she said ok. We waited till about 6:23 and then reminded her we asked for more bread. Also asked for ketchup and butter this time because who knows if it'll arrive. I know things move fast when we engage the manager as I explained earlier. She looked at us like this was the first time she heard it even though she clearly acknowledged it at 6:12pm and said ""oh sure, I can bring more bread"" with a blank stare. Bread came out around 6:35 with the butter and ketchup.. 23 minutes after our initial request.  Looking around baffled at the service we were getting from her, compared to the 2 tables around us where she was treating them like gods... We were very disappointed. One could consider this discrimination as we were the only non-Caucasian table she was servicing (from what I could see).  Anyways, it was hard to tip when we paid the check. Sadly we gave up 11% because her tip obviously gets split among others. If she was the only one to get a tip, 0% would be a very high tip in my opinion...

Typically, I go to Cheesecake Factory for their huge menu that has something for everyone. The food is typically pretty tasty and they have a vast ""skinnylicious"" menu.

She took our drink orders shortly after we sat down and then did not bring those drinks for at least 10-15 mins. She then took our order and proceeded to take drinks and the order of another table before inputting our order into the computer. Usually our food comes out quickly and to the proper temperature. Today was no different, but that was after she finally inputted the order. The food arrived to the table at approximately 1:45. So 40 mins for 2 salads and 2 sandwiches. It wasn't the speed in the kitchen, but the speed of the server. The food runner was pleasant and retrieved the bread I requested. After we were served, I asked the waitress for a refill assuming it would take a while to get and I was right. I could see our waitress leisurely talking to staff near the kitchen while I waited for my refill. I honestly would not have minded if she was prompt otherwise.

Then she immediately took off and was nowhere to be found for 15 minutes. At 6pm, we flagged down a manager who took our order. I told him it had already been 15-20 minutes and I didn't feel like waiting forever for my food due to the wait. After all.. I came prepared.  The food came out at 6:12 and that's when our server reappeared out of thin air. We asked her for more brown bread and she said ok. We waited till about 6:23 and then reminded her we asked for more bread. Also asked for ketchup and butter this time because who knows if it'll arrive. I know things move fast when we engage the manager as I explained earlier. She looked at us like this was the first time she heard it even though she clearly acknowledged it at 6:12pm and said ""oh sure, I can bring more bread"" with a blank stare. Bread came out around 6:35 with the butter and ketchup.. 23 minutes after our initial request.  Looking around baffled at the service we were getting from her, compared to the 2 tables around us where she was treating them like gods... We were very disappointed. One could consider this discrimination as we were the only non-Caucasian table she was servicing (from what I could see).  Anyways, it was hard to tip when we paid the check. Sadly we gave up 11% because her tip obviously gets split among others. If she was the only one to get a tip, 0% would be a very high tip in my opinion...

Recently I met friends for lunch in Bethesda at The Cheesecake Factory now located in Montgomery Mall (my friends' choice). The restaurant is easy to locate and has plenty of parking within easy walking distance. There is also valet parking for a nominal fee, and they'll stamp your ticket in the restaurant. The ambiance at this location is much nicer to me than at the previous location. It appears to be larger and the seating seems more spread out. It's still noisy, but 5 of use had no trouble conversing. One of the best parts of the visit was our server, Scott. I can't imagine what he thought when he saw our table of five 50 years+ women. He was great though, and even offered to split our checks without our asking. It was a little hard for me to find something that fit into my diet, but I settled on a small Greek salad. It was decent, but nothing really too special. The crab cake that another guest at our table ordered just looked okay and I noticed she didn't ask to have the leftover boxed to take home.  Since Montgomery Mall is a convenient place to meet friends in the Bethesda area, and we had a pleasant experience at this location, I'd actually suggest it myself as a nice place for lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=40,2.56,3.1,3.004,2.7,2.8840000000000003

After about 10 minutes a waiter showed up and took our drink orders. We then waited another 10 minutes for our drink orders, and when they were delivered we told the waiter we were ready to order. He told us he would be right back. After giving our orders, he tells us that the bread isn't ready yet, and he will bring some out when it comes out. After about 20 minutes we see other servers carrying bread to tables. We look for our waiter but he seems to have disappeared. We finally see him bringing food to the table behind us whom arrived after us. We flag him down, and he tells us about how they ordered salads and that takes less time. I told him I thought 40 minutes was a long time to wait for a cheeseburgers and salmon. He then brings out the bread and our food. My salmon was overcooked and cold. My husband's burger was also overcooked. My daughter's salmon was perfect. My mother-in-law's burger was not right.

Too much dressing on side salad that came with our veggie burger.  The chicken in the pasta de vinci was overcooked and dry. Wasn't given big chunks of breast but rather like chick fil a nugget-size and the cream sauce was much saltier than before. Seems like they took a piece leftover chicken and cut into weird little pieces. Also, too much parsley in the sauce.

For appetizers, we shared the Avocado Eggrolls, which consisted of three egg rolls stuffed with avocado, sun-dried tomato, red onion, and cilantro deep fried in a crispy wonton wrapper, served over crispy vermicelli with a sweet tamarind cashew dipping sauce. Instead of getting his usual, my dad ordered the  Chicken Riesling, which consisted of tender chicken breast sautéed with mushrooms, bacon, onions, and garlic in a slightly creamy white wine riesling sauce. I believe that the pasta tasted better with the same sauce as opposed to the butter parmesan sauce. My mom ordered Skinnylicious Chinese Chicken Salad, which consisted grilled chicken, romaine, carrots, bean sprouts, green onions, cilantro, rice noodles, wontons, almonds, and Sesame seeds tossed in a sesame-soy dressing. Her only compliant was it was a bit soggy. I ordered my usual - Miso Salmon, which consisted of salmon marinated with a sweet miso sake glaze served over white rice and snow peas in a savory  white miso sauce.

It was my graduation lunch, so we didn't make a reservation, thinking the ceremony might go longer than anticipated. Anyway, we had to wait 30 minutes, which was kind of a blower because I was in four-inch heels, needed a seat, and the one seat in the small waiting area was occupied. But the time went by faster than expected, especially considering the place was PACKED. (It's much smaller than I expected, too.) I found the hosts to be less than friendly. They were stale-faced and did not apologize when they messed up our table ticket. But our server, Nick, was fantastic. He was fast, polite, genuine, and got all of our orders right without even writing them down! That is a skill only seasoned servers can master.  The bread was not ready for about 15 minutes and when it came out, it wasn't that good. I've definitely had better bread. The entrees came out in record time. I was baffled. I ordered the Shrimp Bistro Pasta and it was phenomenal. Naturally, it was drowning in butter. But the flavors were on point and done tastefully. The only thing I didn't like was that the shrimp were breaded. I feel that is unnecessary. The breading on my shrimp was unevenly cooked (partly burnt, partly soggy, not yummy), but if I removed the breading altogether, the bare shrimp were cooked well and tasted better with the pasta. As a side note, if you're watching your weight, just don't come here. They have a ''skinny'' menu, but why? You're surrounded by cheesecake! You will be tempted. Plus, there's no way I would pay $18 for a salad. For dessert, we were very naughty and ordered a slice of cheesecake EACH. We didn't expect the slices to be that big or that amazing, but they were. The Fresh Strawberry is their most popular flavor and I loved it. It's basic cheesecake with a strawberry topping and it's done right. The Salted Caramel tasted just like you would expect true salted caramel to taste like. The Godiva one had big chunks of real Godiva chocolate - holy smokes. The best one by far was the Oreo. Everyone was blown away.  We took half of everything home in boxes because that's how big the portions are. The menu seems to be expensive, but the huge portions make up for it. We also ordered an extra entree and cheesecake to go and our bill was under $150. Not bad for four, essentially five people.  I will definitely be back here. My first visit was a 10/10.

He told us he would be right back. After giving our orders, he tells us that the bread isn't ready yet, and he will bring some out when it comes out.

If I would have known I was purchasing a frozen cheesecake I would not have brought it. 35 minutes later I am home and my cheese cake is icy in the middle. Guess I have to learn to make my own cheesecake now! SMFH... Never again all I came in for was the cheesecake.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=40,2.76,2.8,2.928,2.3440000000000003,2.784

We have been coming to this location ever since it moved from the White Flint Mall location.  Last night, we came here around 9:30pm, the restaurant was not busy and seemed like they had ample servers still working. We were seated immediately, and our server took our drink order. However, he did not ask us if we wanted any bread, and never brought out any of the bread. After waiting for 20 minutes (he had already taken our orders at this point), I asked him to bring us out some bread, and he finally did but the bread was cold! Bread here has always been warm, at least luke warm, but last night, the bread was just cold. Our order also took around 20-25 minutes to arrive even though the restaurant was NOT busy. Not sure what the deal was there, but we have never had to wait that long even during busy hours. Then, we order a slice of cake and we definitely noticed a decrease in size. I am not sure if this is something that the corporate has changed recently but we were incredibly surprised. It seemed that they were trying to fill the plate with whipped cream instead.  I have been a cheesecake factory regular probably since 2012, but last night was definitely one of the least pleasant dining experience.

THEN he took my order by saying  ""what do you want""....ummmm not exactly the friendly Nature i'm used to getting from the day staff at other locations. I ordered and paid. Then I politely pointed out that the next available slice of pumpkin pecan was missing the pecan portion in the center, and I didn't want to get served that piece. Saul snapped at me....and said ""what"". Then said ""ya ill take a look at it"".  He pulled the tray out and muttered ""not a big deal"", but clearly a huge chunk was missing like from a previous serving spatula grabbing it. He grabbed a tissue and plucked the piece off the tray and plated it and put it in the cooler! Some other poor sap was going to get ripped off!   Then he proceeded to grab the next slice and throw it in a container....literally, dropped it from about 8"" above the counter.  I consider myself a CCF connoisseur, so i KNOW that he shouldn't have even been packing the cheesecake. There are dessert staff behind the counter that tray and top the slices and the server usually packs them in the to go bag. I got annoyed and started texting my husband .....HUGE mistake to take my eyes off my food. A few minutes later, saul slides my bag across the counter. He used a brown paper bag, which cant hold 4 slices well, i shouldve known that, but it didnt dawn on me. I saw no silverware and asked ""can i get some silverware"". Saul replied.... ""whatcha want?""  Then grabbed forks without me responding and said ""forks good"" and threw them on top of the bag.  At that point, I just left. What a terrible experience.  BUT THIS IS THE INFURIATING PART: i live 55 minutes away. I got home and pulled the slices out of the bag.  THE CONTAINERS WERE TOSSED IN THE BAG LOPSIDED!!!!

I was surprised and impressed there was no wait. May have been because we dined at 10:00 pm. The restaurant didn't seem very busy but our waitress was clearly overwhelmed with our party. Slow off the bat and slow at keep drinks refilled. What was frustrating was that there always seemed to be 4 employees standing around not doing anything. At one point there were about 10 empty plates on our table that needed to be removed and a group of employees was literally standing next to our table. Several of them looked at the table and clean up. Later when a food runner dropped off some of main courses I politely asked him to take some of the plates and he had an attitude, he scoffed but he took them. Regarding the food, the crab dip was good. The egg rolls were wack. The bread to start was decent. Rock hard butter but decent bread. My main course was a bacon cheese burger. I think it was called the bacon bacon burger. Asked for it medium rare, it came medium well and was not very good. Five guys is about 10 times better than that burger. Fries were good but not hot. The highlight of the evening was the macadamia nut cheese cake. If it weren't for the cheesecake I would never return. Next time I would literally only order the cheesecake.

Well first let me say, when i called to make the reservation i asked if they took reservations and the guy said No! Then i said 'even for large parties' and he said, well for large parties then YES. He should have said that bc if I hadn't asked further we wouldn't have made reservations.  Fast forward to the date, several folks arrived early and they told them the reservation had been changed to a different time. I was confused bc they called the day before to confirm so who would have changed the time? I called them on my route but they said i called them at noon to change the time which i hadn't!!! At first i thought maybe my boss had called bc we have similar names but she said she hadn't either?? Either way, they were able to seat us outside on their ""outside patio"" which is in the hall of the mall.

15,Dan F.,"Potomac, MD",0,2,,1.0,2018-01-09,This restaurant is disorganized and incompetent.  I picked up 2 salads to go and when I get home I realized that 1 of them was missing the chicken. So I called to ask for a refund for one of the salads. I was told only a manager could process a refund and put on hold for 10 minutes. A manager never came to pick up so the woman at the desk promised me that she would take care of it. Not surprisingly  I checked my credit card online and I was never refunded the money. So I called back again and was put on hold for another 10 minutes to talk to a manager. This manager told me that since the incident happened several days ago she was unable to process the refund for me.  Needless to say I would not advise carrying out from this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda,2.44,2.78,2.844,,2.644
8,Penny C.,"North Bethesda, MD",2,36,,1.0,2018-01-13,"We ordered carry out for the first time and were really disappointed with the quality and portion sizes. I was quite upset to see such small portions when we normally get much larger portions when we dine in. They use huge containers but barely put anything in them. Also, nothing tasted good. It all tasted like cafeteria food. I am so, so disappointed with all the food we had. We would have better off eating at the eatery in the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda,2.44,2.78,2.836,,2.644
