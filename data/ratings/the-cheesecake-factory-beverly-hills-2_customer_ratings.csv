181,Liz C.,"Los Angeles, CA",246,173,52.0,4.0,2012-01-16,"I have a love-hate relationship with The Cheesecake Factory... I love, love, love to indulge on tasty pastas, burgers, sandwiches, and salads here. I really love that they have huge portions so that I can save half my meal for another meal later. I also truly love their extensive menu (although I think a few items need the boot) that is updated with new items to try quite often. I hate that I cannot resist from stuffing myself with their warm bread and more of my dinner-size pasta and steaks -- after I'm already feeling somewhat full from the bread. I also hate that I want to try every new item they bring to the menu because the descriptions and ingredients seem so delectable! It really doesn't help that most of their foods are quite heavy and portions are incredible. Needless to say, I'm stuck in the middle. But, I always leave with a happy stomach and leftovers for later, so 4 stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beverly-hills-2?start=300,3.48,3.48,3.48,3.3120000000000003,3.4800000000000004

365,Jackie T.,"New York, NY",70,155,556.0,4.0,2012-01-18,"I love this place for its happy hour prices (food), tasty menu choices, restaurant decor, and service.  I usually visit this Cheesecake Factory as a party for two and we share the following happy hour dishes: Avocado Egg Rolls, Chicken or Beef Sliders, and Calamari.  We also share a slice of cheese cake. The slices are huge, so it's definitely fit for two people, especially after feasting on the happy hour menu.  Every time I visit, I like to try a cheese cake that I haven't tried before. My favorite so far is the Ultimate Red Velvet cheese cake. Our bill usually totals to about $30-35, which is quite a deal for Beverly Hills.

313,Jeff B.,"Los Angeles, CA",617,801,7330.0,4.0,2012-03-24,"(Dined 3/18/12 SU): The name says it all, but it is so much more than that! I would start adding the word ""Burger"" to the name. A friend and I had a free Sunday after we cancelled a wine tasting event due to possible inclimate weather (this never materialized), so we had an open day of psuedo-spontaneity which took us from the Valley, to the Eastside, Mid-Wilshire, and ultimately to the Westside at The Cheesecake Factory in Beverly Hills. Neither of us have been to this location, and I was driven by the $25.00 gift card that needed to be used. Although my phone's GPS guided us here, we initially missed it because of a tall leafy tree covering up the store's neon sign out front. It was around 8pm when we finally walked in, and the place was packed...but not packed enough to seat us immediately. I can honestly say this was the first time I've never had to wait to be seated. Karma was on our side this even, and in fact, the entire day. At this point, we were both starving, so it took us some time to figure out what to eat because everything we saw around us and what we read on the menu was appealing to us. After getting glasses of water and at least decided on a blended mango margarita for me ($10.95), and a ""skinny-style"" red raspberry martini ($8.95) for my friend. I eventually decided on the Macaroni & Cheese Burger ($11.95) and substituted for sweet potato fries ($1.00 extra), and the Fish Tacos ($13.95) for my friend. To finish off the meal, we had the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake ($7.95). While we carried on our insightful conversation and exhorted about our day's adventures, we enjoyed our drinks and the table bread and butter. I can't speak about her martini but I do love their margaritas, and this instance was no different. Our food soon came out and man did it smell amazing! Again, I can't speak about her fish tacos, but my glamburger was about to take over the world...like Kim Kardashian's ass! I literally had to size this bad boy up. Two encounters with humongous burgers in recent weeks, I don't think my heart can take it anymore! The best plan of action was to stack everything together and smash it all down, so at least it's manageable for me to wrap my pie-hole around it. I truly do love their assortment of glamburgers, and I've never tried this one before. No words can do justice how much I thoroughly enjoyed the combination of throwing a dollop of fried mac & cheese on top of my burger patty - ingenious! In order to have room for dessert, I had to have half of this and my always tasty sweet potato fries packed-up for a later meal. Now, I've had the Reese's cheesecake which happens to be one of my favorites, and my friend loves peanut butter, so we were both on a peanut butter high. We amazingly polished off the cheesecake, probably to our detriment.    One other thing (mentioned the waiting earlier) I've always had an issue with them was their service. This time, I couldn't praise the service more. Our attractive waitress, Amanda, was very attentive and accommodating. Our water glasses were always filled (very important to me), and she was able to include some marinara sauce on my burger (I guess it normally doesn't) as it does when you only order the mac & cheese. I should have asked for her number (I was with a more familial female friend so it would have been fine)!  Parking is everywhere, from the street, valet, and parking structures. We parked in the structure across the street with a flat $5.00 fee. Overall, I'm usually not a fan of chain restaurants (I do list Elephant Bar, Outback Steakhouse, Claim Jumpers, and Red Robin as some of my favorite chains), but if I keep having experiences like this with the Cheesecake Factory, I might have to add them to the list. Maybe I just have to come to this location! Their cheesecakes are undeniable, and I now always go for their glamburgers. These two menu items for me have singled them out among the crowd. There is value based on the portion sizes and as noted by the prices I quoted above (total bill was around $54.00 before gift card and tip). The atmosphere is casual and family-oriented, but this particular location had the lighting set to more romantic mood, which is fine by me. Because of the dim lighting, I honestly don't know how the décor is. Where we sat (close to the front window), it did feel a bit tight, but we made the most of it. And they take my credit card of choice...AMEX!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beverly-hills-2?start=240,3.84,3.84,3.84,3.248,3.84

I go to different franchises of this restaurant, but I thought the service would be spectacular since it is in Beverly Hills-I thought wrong. We were seated with no issue, but the hostess ended up taking both our drink orders and entree orders because our waitress, Kelly, did not acknowledge us. Actually, she never introduced herself and I had to ask another employee for her name. The service was terrible, I felt rushed and the employees did not seem happy at all. Another thing, the open kitchen in this particular restaurant is something I have never seen at a Cheesecake Factory. However, all the employees were snacking on food and soda the whole time!

The message to consumers... you're going to get more food than you can devour in one sitting.  In fact, most items are meant so that you will have two (let me repeat 2) servings.  With that in mind, you should always share at Cheesecake Factory (unless of course you want to eat a second helping of what you ordered later in the day). On another note, Cheesecake Factory has a lite menu.  Everything on it is under 500 calories. That sounds grand for the person that wants to actually eat and finish a meal here.  With a big party, I only ordered a 400 calorie Greek Salad (quite nice and rather small) only to partake of the meals of everyone else that ordered a regular meal (serving for 2).  Long story short, Cheesecake Factory is one of the better restaurants to have a family style meal.  With 4 or more people, just order half the number of meals (plus one if you're really hungry) and share.  That's the true value of the Cheesecake Factory.  And I'm a fan of that... sharing is caring!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beverly-hills-2?start=300,3.68,3.68,3.68,3.2800000000000002,3.6800000000000006

The food, itself, was served hot and was thoroughly delicious!...... My recommendation to others (who would consider ordering this) would be to allow yourself to indulge in a couple of extra slices of bread served before the meal. Otherwise, you may need a slice of cheesecake to finally get full..... As for their coffee, if you desire hair on the soles of your feet, by all means order a cup!!! Otherwise, AVOID!!! Their blend is extremely bitter and way, way too strong!! In closing, I am mostly not a fan of this restaurant. Truth be told, I would not come here on my own.

401,Rita W.,"Rockville, MD",527,337,1553.0,2.0,2013-02-14,"What happened to this location??? I remember enjoying it about 5 years ago, but after dish after dish of disappointment and bad service (and possibly bad luck), I've decided to write a review for this Cheesecake Factory location.  I used to looooooove cheesecake factory. The environment looked very nice, and they have great variety, as well as amazing cheesecakes. Service used to be better, but my recent experiences were just the opposite.  This is from my most recent experience: We got in and waited, but no one was there to greet and seat us. Once someone came by, we got seated quickly, which was good. The waitress said that she can take our baby's stroller away and bring us a high chair. The bf collapsed the stroller to save room, but it took nearly ten minutes for the high chair to come.  Our orders were taken, and she said that she will bring us our bread and butter. That never showed up. Other tables got bread and butter, but we did not. We also were not offered refills of water.  It took a long time for our appetizer to come out. We got the buffalo wings that day because I wanted something spicy, and we can feed chicken to our little one. Once we were done with the wings, we waited nearly half an hour for our entrees to show up. Ahhh.. that means we had to pay for parking in that 2 hour free lot, since we waited so much already!  Anyways, the buffalo wings were just decent. Not worth the money. The sauce tasted great, but the meat itself was just super dry. I've had better from Domino's. Quite depressing, huh?  So our entrees finally came. We ordered the grilled chicken kids meal for the little one, the burrito for the bf, and the chinese chicken salad for myself. The kids meal was a total rip off. Our little one refused to eat any of it! She normally loves chicken, but she kept spitting it out. UGH!! Oh, it was just super dry. Gross.  My salad looked smaller than the other times I've ordered it. Maybe I should have stuck with a sandwich or a burger. The salad was drenched and all disgusting, as if it was just sitting out there for at least half an hour. There was only a few small pieces of chicken inside. TOTAL RIPOFF! It used to be great, but that salad to price ratio was the worst ever. Other chains, such as cpk, now offers better chinese chicken salads. Sorry, cheesecake factory... what happened to yours?? I would have ordered the tuna tataki salad, but I'm pregnant again, soooo that was out of the question for uber safety issues.  At least the bf's burrito was decent. The presentation was one long burrito on an oval plate with sauce and tomatoes on top of it. It was the most worthwhile thing we got that day. It came with a side of guacamole, sour cream, and black beans.  Sooooo.... overall, Cheesecake Factory has declined a lot. Portions used to be bigger, service used to be better, and I've always got my free bread and butter, but that experience... nope. Horrible. Just horrible. I was lucky that I paid mostly in giftcards because if I were to use my own hard earned cash at this place, I'd be super pissed. Sad that the San Vincente location in west LA closed.. *SIGH*  In the past, I've tried the following:  tons of fun burger (decent), chicken enchiladas (yum), veggie burger (decent), mushroom burger (way too greasy), chicken teriyaki (too many fat chunks), chicken picatta (second grossest thing I've had here), pulled pork sandwich (lacking the meats quite a bit), fish tacos (okay), tuna takaki salad (probably my favorite entree, but such a small portion), the navajo (good sandwich), chicken sandwich (okay), fish and chips (use extra sauce and ketchup in case of dryness), lettuce wraps (used to be better as well), chicken pot stickers (so small!), avocado eggrolls (meh), and more.  I've also tried most their cheesecake menu, and those at least were always par or better. My faves are the vanilla bean, dulce de leche, and tiramisu. I will be trying their mango keylime tonight, since I got it to go. When I'm not pregnant anymore, I'll probably just return for drinks (MOJITO!!!!) and cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beverly-hills-2?start=180,3.36,3.52,3.52,2.8880000000000003,3.4560000000000004

396,Jim B.,"Vaughan, Canada",44,653,411.0,4.0,2013-05-05,"Whenever I venture across the border, a visit to a Cheesecake Factory is always part of the plan, mainly because we don't have them in Canada and secondly the food has always been good. You know you're going to get a great meal, reasonably priced, huge portion size, combined with the largest assortment of cheesecakes on the planet. This location bills itself as the original location of a franchise that now has restaurants in most major US cities. It's location...in Beverly Hills, one block from Rodeo Drive, is ideal. We found parking on the street ($2/hr), but noticed several parking lots in the area with decent rates. We were seated immediately (in Buffalo the wait can be upwards of an hour) and then the real challenge begins...what to order from their HUGE menu. We opted for the Orange Chicken (lightly battered white chicken pieces, smothered in an orange sauce, with veggies and brown rice) and  Cashew Chicken (lightly battered chicken pieces in a spicy asian sauce with brown rice)....both were $16.99 each. The portion size is gigantic.....the chicken must have been two full breasts cut into pieces....rich in flavour with a great balance of orange flavour. Our server, Lauren R was great. She was attentive, friendly and very efficient. The table next to us were a real pain and she kept her cool through every interaction she had with them. Kudos to her. If you're fortunate enough to have room left over after dinner, a piece of cheesecake is in order. I've tried approx. 6 or 7 different kinds, with my favourite being the Key Lime Cheesecake (or what I prefer to call a slice of heaven here on earth). I usually take my dessert to go as I'm always full from dinner. I really have only two minor complaints about this location: 1) the tables are very close together...so private conversations are not possible (and as a side note to the two dudes seated next to us)..it is a courtesy, when eating out, that you chew your food with your mouth closed, not talk with your mouth full, use utensils, etc, etc. 2) my biggest complaint......please open a restaurant in Toronto.....we need a Cheesecake Factory there.

Just the right blend of spices, chicken, peas, and a dash of crispy tortilla strips. Their blackened chicken sandwitch is fantastic...

Normally we like to go to Beverly hills and eat some authentic Persian Food at Aram Restaurant just down the street from the cheesecake factory. On this day, we went to Beverly hills and after many years our famous Persian spot closed. Instead we decided to go the cheesecake factory.  First, we were on a one way street and we had to turn around. We decided to turn into a parking structure, but this car was backing out of the structure and almost hit us. We ended up just u turning it and going around the corner, were a cop turned on his lights behind us. We told him what happened and he ended up letting us go with out a ticket to ring in the new year.  Thank god for that! We parked and went to the restaurant. They were really busy, When I went up to the hostess, I thought she would say the wait would be at least 30 min. Luckly, we got sat right away. I orded the vegi burger with coleslaw. I have to say this was one of my faviorts. Of all the vegi burgers I have ate, I give this an A Plus. We also got the small plate lettuce wraps. They were good, but it was hard to roll them up in the romaine lettuce they give you. My kids got the kids burger sliders, and my husband ended up getting fish tacos. The fish tacos were plain, and the should have been served with some cabbage.  Our server was a very tall, I think he said he was 6 Ft 6. I was not ready to order because of the largeness of the menu. He came and checked back several times. When we were ready to order, I noticed he took our order with out writing it down, and then he went and took 3 more tables orders. When we got our food I ended up waiting for another 10 min for my vegi burger because he forgot to put it in. It was so good though, that I really did not care.  For dessert, we ended up getting two cheesecakes to go. Pinapple upside down cake cheesecake was really good!!! Then we got a raspberry cheesecake with a chocolate crust which I did not care for. 2 pieces of cheesecake cost me almost 17 dollars.  Above all the food was great and so was the atmosphere. My server was great two, he just needs to smile a little more, and when he goes to a new table, he needs to present himself by saying his name or letting me no what the specials are ext..

She sat me in a crowded section of the restaurant when there were so many other available tables. She asked me to sit in the booth section of the table because I would be"" in the way "" of other guests. I ordered the chicken picata with extra sauce on the side, which she failed to bring me until I reminded her. She brought it to me at least 15 mins after the request and it was cold thus due to the wait my entire meal became cold. She didn't ask  once if I needed a drink refill.

The sliders I had for my starter were four almost standard size burgers. Then the main meal came and I barely made a dent in it.  Perhaps wouldn't be too bad if you knew in advance they were that large and then you just bought one to share between two, but that feels a bit pointless. Also, the menu was huge. Possibly the largest I've ever seen. So large that it stopped for an ad break from time to time. Point for awesome looking desserts (that I never got to trying as the starter had filled me up already) and another point for amazing value. But cheap meals and oversized portions aren't for me.

At the Cheesecake Factory in fashion valley (San Diego) it's more crispy and fresh. Still, the one in BH is passable. The Caesar salad was flavorful but the lettuce was too wilted for my taste. Could have been much better. I've been to this location on several occasions and I always make sure that I sit out front near the sidewalk. The people watching is outstanding.  Our server, Kurt/Curt, was new and you could tell. He was nervous. And he made sure that he told us that he was new. He handled our orders just fine but he struggled mightily with our neighbor (a 20-year veteran of the BH location). The woman asked for X and he brought Y. Customer pointed out that Y was not X. Tried again but this time the server brought A instead of X. The customer was clearly growing tired and impatient with the new server. The server eventually got it right, though. Anyhow, felt sorry for the guy. Hopefully he's given a chance to improve and excel. All and all, very middle of the road experience.

It was smaller than most Cheesecake Factory restaurants that I have been to, half the employees looked sloppy, were too loud, and not very clean cut, and the environment just felt very stuffy.  The food was good but the atmosphere was very disappointing. It kind of reminded of being in an unfamiliar city or state at a restaurant that was trying to be nice but isn't really that nice.  You would think with this being the Beverly Hills location that it would be at the top of the charts. The service was fake. Not genuine at all. Very dry energy. There was one point when he came to the table on his way to the kitchen and said ""Everything ok here? Ok good"". He never stopped at the table. He just said it as he walked by.

When he brought the milkshake out, he apologized that it took so long due to the whole made by scratch getup. We didn't even mind the wait until he kept bringing it up with his weird excuse. We ordered at that point, and received our food a quick 10 minutes later.  Andrew and his runner practically threw our plates onto the table which alarmed us and the other 6 people sitting on top of us before they quickly ran out of the room. The boyfriend's chicken was fine, but my salad was completely soggy. Considering they didn't even ask if everything looked ok, I decided sending it back would be a waste of my time.  Throughout the meal, our server kept grabbing small plates, ramekins and silverware off the table which was so unnecessary and rude considering they weren't very busy, which also made me wonder why he was sweating so much...

The waits like at any Cheesecake Factory are long. The menu even longer. Seriously, the selection is just too  big. Somehow they manage to make most dishes really taste ok. You can eat anything from American to Mexican cuisine here, really anything you could be in the mood for, I am sure they will have. I usually go with one of the huge salads, good but enough sodium and fat for the entire day.

372,Daniel H.,"San Francisco, CA",87,300,205.0,3.0,2014-08-01,"This place has its ups and its downs, but is pretty much an all around average chain restaurant located in Beverly Hills. I've been coming to this location for many years because it has always been a consistent and pretty convenient place to come to grab a bite to eat. Sometimes you just feel like munching away on one of their many popular menu items.  The portions here are pretty big, and most of the time I have to take what I am eating to go with me. Most of what I've tried here is pretty good, but I have a few favorites that I always return to. I really like the salads that they have here, and the portions are generous...I think my favorite would be the BBQ chicken salad but take a look at some of the other creative salads that they have to offer. Pasta dishes are another favorite of mine, and I like the Chicken Bellagio, the Cajun Jambalaya, and the Garlic Noodles with chicken. You can start of a meal with one of their many appetizers too, and my favorite is the Tex Mex Egg rolls. Like I said, since the portions are big, I never really have room for dessert here. Overall, I have found their food to be pretty consistent, which is good for any chain restaurant. I think the one thing that is inconsistent here is the service. On some days everyone is excellent from the hostess that greats you in the front to the waiter that takes care of you throughout your meal. However, in some cases, they are kind of lacking in customer service and really need training to learn to be more consistent to their customers. On my latest visit here, my sister went to the hostess, but they didn't acknowledge her immediately because they were too involved with a personal conversation. When they seated us, our table was clearly missing a chair that we needed, and when I said something about this she had already run off, so I had to pull one for myself from another unoccupied table. Moments like this just take simple thought, and I'm surprised that something as easy as this went unacknowledged by the person who sat us at the table...totally unprofessional! The waiter that day was friendly, but could have been a bit more attentive give that there were not too many other guests dining at that time. Other times, the waiter service has been excellent here though. I'll probably come back to this location again, but I really hope that the service improves and doesn't continue to decline over time. Compared to other restaurants in the area, they do remain more affordable in terms of their pricing. As a word of caution, they do get very busy around meal times, especially during the weekends. There is also not much waiting room to stand near the hostess desk so it can get pretty cramped with people and servers walking in and our of the main doorway...so just keep that in mind if you choose to dine here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beverly-hills-2?start=260,3.28,3.33,3.33,2.8280000000000003,3.31

Our drink order was quickly placed, so we were glad about that, especially since we did a lot of walking. Now, here is where it gets a little tough, we had to request bread a few times before the waiter brought it out, and the waiter  seemed a bit preoccupied or something. It didn't really bother us at the time, however in completing my review, I like to be honest and that could be the drawback to why I did not give 5 stars. We also had to request our check a couple of times, and this is huge when you paid for metered parking and the time is close to end, and you are parked far. Food wise, we always enjoy the Cheesecake Factory food, so no complaints there. The location is good. I wish they had more patio seating in the front, its designed not for a family or group, but for 2 people or 3 not as endowed people.

It pains me to write this review.  The Cheesecake Factory is my favorite Chain Restaurant.  I became a Cheesecake Factory fanatic after eating here 25 years ago!  Found ourselves in Beverly Hills recently, so I was excited to take my wife and other family members here!  I have to say that this is not the same Cheesecake Factory I remembered.  It was a very disappointing and disheartening experience!!! Took me a little while to locate the restaurant because their name is covered by trees.  Finally found them and walked in.  Greeted by the hostess and only waited a few minutes before being seated.  First thing I noticed when we were inside was that this place is small!  Never noticed that before.  They are much smaller than any other location that I have been to even with their being some tables outside.  The restrooms?  Do not recommend using them.  They were dirty!  There is one restroom that is shared by both men and women.  If you go through another door (which most of the employees go through), then you will find a separate men's room and women's room.  Both were also not very clean.  ( 2 stars for the ambiance). Service was below average.  Our waiter was attentive, but it really felt like he was rushing us to finish and leave.  He never cracked a smile or even introduce himself.  Not what I'm used to when I go to Cheesecake Factory locations.  ( 2 stars for service). The food was disappointing as well.  I ordered the Kobe Burger.  I ordered it medium, but it came out well done.  I should have asked for another one, but I did not feel like waiting another 30 minutes because I was already starving.  It was the worst burger that I have ever had at any Cheesecake Factory.  ( 2 stars ) My brother in law was also not happy with his burger.  He had the Classic Burger.  He said that his burger from Black Bear Diner was much better than the one made here.  ( 2 stars ) There was some good news, though.  My brother in law's wife loved the Miso Salmon.  ( 5 stars ) My wife ordered her favorite which is the Chicken Katsu.  It did not disappoint her.  She said it was as good as the other locations, if not better.  ( 5 stars ) This is the first time ever that I have not ordered a slice of Cheesecake from The Cheesecake Factory.  I was just so disappointed with everything that happened!!!  Did not want to stay in the restaurant any longer. I will always be thankful for discovering The Cheesecake Factory here In Beverly Hills 25 years ago.  I just do not know if I would ever come back here after this disappointing experience.  At least I never had this bad experience the first time I went here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beverly-hills-2?start=100,3.28,3.26,3.26,2.408,3.2680000000000002

Also, the Herb-crusted Filet of Salmon was obviously NOT FRESH.  The 6'6"" waiter was terrific and so were the help, but the food was very subpar for such a restaurant! To top it off, the Valet parking was a big problem.  We paid $7.00 to the person at the front and then he took off and when our car arrived, the I gave the person who retrieved our car a $1.00 tip.  He quickly came back and said that I did NOT pay the $7.00 and accused me of lying and asked another person if we paid the $7.00 and the ""new"" person at the counter said that we didn't!  The said that we didn't pay and when I protested that I did and that the person to whom we gave the $7.00 had gone to park a car, he then tried calling that person with his cell phone. We were delayed from leaving the restaurant for over 15 minutes, until the guy came back.  We realize that the Valet parking is not directly connected with the restaurant, but it added to our distaste of this particular Cheesecake Factory and we would never go back there again and we will definitely tell all our friends to not go to a Cheesecake Factory since the food is now very subpar and the food that they prepare is very old and not FRESH! We eat out a lot and we used to frequent Cheesecake Factories which we felt had outstanding food, but the last two times we went to the Cheescake Factory (one was at  the Sherman Oaks Galleria), we were extremely disappointed.  At the S.O. Galleria, we waited a long time after ordering out food and when it finally came it wasn't cold and the pasta was NOT COOKED (still hard and when we called the manager, he sent the pasta dishes back and it took them over a half hour to bring back the ""cooked"" pasta dishes and it was very cold (obviously sitting on the counter for a long time after the cook finished it)l  The portions on ALL OF THE DISHES were appallingly small.  We don't know whether this was a new cook or not, but whoever prepared our food was obviously did not belong with the Cheesecake Factoryl After our last two experiences, we can understand closing down Cheesecake Factory restaurants.  We used to go to the one in Woodland Hills (on  Canoga Ave.) and on this particular night, we tried finding the C.F. at 121 LaCienaga in all the traffic around the Beverly Center.  It took us over 1 1/2 hours trying to find this particular CF, & had to call someone to find out the closest CF to the one that WAS at the Beverly Ctr. which was the one on Beverly Dr., BH.  When we asked the waiter in the BH restaurant, he didn't know of any CF on LaCienaga.

Because my friend had just gotten off a 13 hour shift and hadn't eaten, we took the manager on his word that our entrees would come out right away as we ordered.  A few minutes later (an hour into waiting for food so far) the food comes out, and again the completely wrong order and ICE COLD!!!

I have came here numerous times and have held back writing a bad review just because I like the food at Cheesecake so much, but today was the last straw.  I came here for Mother's Day with my family and the hostess would not seat my brother and I who were waiting for the rest of my family who was still finding parking outside even though more than half the restaurant was empty. Then when my family finally came inside we asked to be seated on the outside patio and she said it was full, my father literally walked her outside and showed her an Open table after arguing back and forth and she finally sat us. The manager came out and apologized but 15 minutes of our time was wasted, and at the end gave us 30% off the bill, but money is not an issue here, while the manager was nice and didnt charge us full price i would have much rathered pay extra and have a better experience. I have had numerous bad experiences here from the waiter spilling a drink all over my clothes, to being charged extra on the bill.  It is such a shame because the food is truly amazing and most of the staff is very nice but the ones who don't know what they are doing truly ruin it for the restaurant.

When waiting at the front, what I don't like about the location is the very slim hallway you walk through to enter.  It was crowded and there was no other place to wait but here.  We blocked the hallway and had to keep moving around so the waiters could deliver food to their customers.  The wait was long, but this was not The Cheesecake Factories fault.  The front desk guy seemed a little snooty, but it was late and he could have just been tired.  I was a bit grumpy after waiting 15 minutes.

I have been a loyal customer to this chain for the past 10 years, most of my visits being to the one in Chicago. Either way, I've had almost everything listed in that menu book and a majority of the cheesecake flavors as well. I always attend half off cheesecake day, stocking up on a few great flavors/slices. I clearly remember in the past being able to go to the takeout counter and order multiple slices. This time around, 1 hour before closing on the last half off day, I was told I can only order one slice per person. But first, I waited in line for about 20/25 minutes picking out cheesecakes / asking my friends over the phone which slices they wanted. It's finals week at school, some people just don't have time to make it out here to get their own slice. So being the nice friend, I took orders to bring it back to them. By the time I reached the counter, I am told only one slice per person. Now, I have 7 orders currently waiting to be fulfilled. I asked him why I couldn't get more than one slice and he kept saying 'only one'. I then go talk to the host about this issue and then a manager. After asking them why they didn't want my service / money for these seven cheesecake orders, I still got the 'one per person' speech. HOWEVER - My friend went 3 hours before me to get cheesecake to go as well. She was able to bring home multiple slices; the man at the front even asked her if she wanted any more slices to go. Walking into the restaurant, I see a man coming up with two large to-go bags filled with only cheesecake to go boxes. One man... about 10 cheesecake boxes. Things just don't add up and I am very disappointed and angry at The Cheesecake Factory. Right now, I'm not sure if I will ever be a returning customer here - as well as my family and 6 friends who wanted those slices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beverly-hills-2?start=80,3.0,3.13,3.316,2.468,3.078

206,Donald S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,2.0,2015-08-25,I would only give 1 star but I feel the waiter did a good job. He was wierd and didn't make eye contact. I had the chicken and biscuits which is like a pot pie without the pie. It had 2 hairs in it. They said it was corn husk fibers but there is no corn in the chicken and biscuits. I don't think there any corn with husks on the menu at all. They replaced my dish very quickly almost suspiciously so.  In closing I can not recommend this place unless you like your chicken and biscuits with a side of pubes.

The shrimp with angel hair was served not fully cooked. The noodle was all sticky together like very tough. They recooked for me but still got some tough noodles in it.  The shrimp was not too bad.

The strawberries did not seem fresh at all. They had little flavor. The cheesecake crust was soft instead of having a slightly crunchy/hard graham cracker crust. The cheesecake could have been a lot colder.

Food wise, just about everything is par and the portions are huge.  We ordered the Thai lettuce wrap and the grilled chicken tostada salad.  The Thai wrap was a great choice and healthy.  I highly recommend it.  We wanted the grilled chicken tostada's pico de gallo sauce to be on the side instead of tossed, but it didn't come as we wanted ( though ok. We didn't mind).  The chicken was rubbery and chewy.  We could have had the tostada salad without the chicken.  It would have probably tasted better. This is the first Cheesecake Factory that I came to as a kid, and it used to be busy as well all the time but well managed and organized.  It's kinda sad to revisit and see this place a chaos with a crowd hovering around the check in table and bumping into each other while the waiters and waitresses can hardly do their jobs right.   I am sure the cheesecakes are delish.  We didn't have any desserts because I pretty much lost my appetite sitting in this restaurant watching chaos flashing right in front of my face between the customers impatiently waiting to get their tables versus waiters & waitresses bring out the wrong charges to the wrong tables....yikes.

155,Jocelyn L.,"San Francisco, CA",356,482,337.0,2.0,2016-01-18,"Can't believe I'm reviewing this place. I came here with friends, only because the cool jazz bar that we wanted to try down the street, Spaghettini & Dave Koz Lounge, was closed for a private event. Super bummer. We walked by Caffe Roma, which my friend had recommended, but it was SO LOUD and felt like a night in WeHo, when we were friends wanting to catch up and talk to each other. So we came to Cheesecake Factory, which I guess was fine for one of my picky eater friends! Saturday night, around 9:45pm, we waited 10-15 mins to be seated. Not crazy like 1-2 hr wait, but come on, on a saturday night so late?! The restaurant was packed.  Kurt was our waiter, and he was kind of snooty. He kept trying to up-sell things to us, which we hated, like adding on chicken to your salad, adding this or that, etc. And it was in a way where he had that tone of, ""Are you SURE you DON'T want to add chicken to your salad? It's really small."" I really hate when people try to do it to me, especially if they aren't nice. He always seemed like he was in a rush to do this and that, and it wasn't for our table either, it was to get back to the kitchen. When he came to the table and gave everyone's drink except mine, he said Georgia Peach was on the way. When he walked away, my friend said, didn't you get the Bellini? At this point, Kurt was halfway to the kitchen, and shouted back to us (we weren't sure if he heard us) - ""I MEANT YOUR PEACH BELLINI!!!"" It was like he heard us. Very strange.  On the other hand, we had a super nice bus boy who was very sweet. You could tell that he was very genuine and treated his customers (including us) well. Crazy story - my friend was wearing one of those skirts that zips from top to bottom in the back, and for some crazy reason, it unzipped where you could see her butt. She was leaving for the night, then felt it and sat down embarrassingly, then bus boy came over trying to make it better by saying it was alright, and offering her a napkin. It was so funny, because although he was super sweet, it just made the embarrassing situation even more noticeable. LOL. There was no moral to this story, I just wanted to share it because I thought it was hilarious, and it just shows how nice the bus boy was.  Anyway, I ordered two drinks:  Peach Blended Bellini, and the Asian Pear Martini. Both were fantastic, except there was probably no reason to card me since it tasted like there was no alcohol in them. They were $9 and $12 respectively, which came out to 21 before tax and tip, which added up to pretty expensive for just drinks, that barely gave me a buzz. I guess, what does one really expect from the Cheesecake Factory though?  I'm frustrated that I came here, but I were forced to come back because of picky eater friends, I'd probably insist at sitting at the bar, and getting my Blended Peach Bellini. That was pretty good, which is why I give it a 2 stars instead of 1!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beverly-hills-2?start=80,3.4,3.05,3.24,2.9200000000000004,3.19

Idk if he was just rude to us but I'm sure he was rude for everyone. He says like ""absolutely"" all the time but his attitude was just like got annoyed.  Food was also just ""meh"". Garlic noodle tasted bad at this place. And my friend ordered pitch smoothie but waiter brought us strawberry smoothie. I dont wanted to bother him so we didn't complain about it.

The management is terrible.  I say this because the wait staff are nice and seem to move fast, but the service is terrible so it must be the management that will not staff the place correctly.   I had not been there in ages, but went twice in one month. Both times we sat outside at the street side tables. We were seated by the host both times so they knew we were there.  First time was with my mother.  We waited about 20 minutes.  I took our order, went in and gave it to the host.  Voila, food!  Second time was last night with a friend.  We were seated outside.  Someone did come and take our drink order. Mine came, hers did not.  No one came to take food orders for a long time.  Finally I had to wave like crazy and got a waiter who got some woman who seemed to possibly be a manager.  I ordered a salad and a burger.  My friend ordered some chicken entree, no starter.  After a while her plate arrived, but no salad for me or burger.  She started on her food.  About 10 minutes later I had to flag down someone again and then suddenly the burger and salad arrived with another slightly different plate for my friend.  Different vegetable.  I then waited MINUTES for catsup or mustard. Minutes! And I had to ask several times.  MINUTES.  Then someone, manager type woman again, and a waiter came out and we thought she said she would take care of the bill.  THEN it turned out she only took off my burger, which is fine, I don't complain for freebies I complain because the experience was TERRIBLE.  Waiter apologized.  He was confused as well.   Really, management should have staff on the outdoor seating at all times.  Letting customers spend such an unpleasant and frustrating experience twice means it is Management fault not the servers.   Plenty of other places to eat on the same block.  Terrible. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that the floors inside are weird, slope unexpectedly and tiled with slippery tile.  Carpet on stairs to the bathroom was really dirty.  Floors in the bathroom dipped and sloped.    All in all, go somewhere else.  Not worth the frustration for generic Cheesecake factory food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beverly-hills-2?start=260,3.24,3.04,3.244,2.8200000000000003,3.1200000000000006

If I wanted Cheesecake Factory again I'd go to a different location. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated, which isn't bad. We sat down, and it took our waiter around 7 minutes to come to our table to get our drink order. He didn't even introduce himself like I have no idea what his name is. He also didn't check on us that much. We had to ask other waiters when we needed something. He would pass our table and not even ask if we were doing okay. I even saw him standing around instead of checking on his customers.  I also asked him could we switch to another table because our table was awkwardly placed in between two groups. He told me to go to the front and ask. Out of all the restaurants I've been to I've never been told to go ask the front after I've been seated. I also asked him for bread, and he said the bus boy was bringing it. I'd been waiting for about 15 minutes for bread at that point. Why couldn't he just bring it to me? I got my appetizer before I got my bread.  It wasn't even just us thinking the service sucked. One of the people next to us literally had to get up and give him the check because he wouldn't come by. You could tell they were getting annoyed. The people on the other side of us were also getting frustrated because he wouldn't come by when they needed stuff.  At least the food was good. I had the factory burger. I wish the waiter would have told me that it doesn't come on a circular bun because it seemed like I got less meat, but it was tasty.

131,John E.,"Valencia, CA",171,272,1474.0,2.0,2016-07-12,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places to eat - usually. I appreciate the generous portions, menu variety and of course the cheesecakes!! However this particular visit to this location left me feeling highly underwhelmed and let down. While usually solid in the entrée quality department, tonight was far from solid. First up we had the Buffalo Blasts - ok they came thru pretty well except we did notice the spice wasn't as noticeable as we have had on other occasions at other CFs. We had literally dunk the blasts in the buffalo sauce cup to get the full kick of flavor - not typical.  We also ordered up the Fried Shrimp. First time with this entrée and boy it was a miss. The mentioned that the shrimp are butterflied but that actually was part of the problem. Butterflying the shrimp led to the shrimp tasting extremely dry and chewy. The breading wasn't any help either. A batter dip would have been better. The coleslaw that came with it was tasteless as well. Oh but not to worry about the fries - there's plenty of those.   Next up was the Chicken Enchiladas. Upon ordering, this sounded great - I hadn't tried these here yet, so I was looking forward to it. Ugh what a mistake. The presentation was very attractive but the taste again was a real let down. Zero flavor and spice to this dish. Yeap - bland Mexican dish. Impossible right? Good amounts of cheese but the sauce and chicken was really below run of the mill. I was pretty surprised. Rice was like sticky white rice with some pesto sauce brushed on it. If I scooped in the rice was actually white in clumps. Uhh not Mexican rice at all. Beans were... well black beans - actually the best part of the meal. No to-go box needed for this plate of leftovers.  Ok one dish that came thru was the Spicy Cashew Chicken on rice. This was a specialty dish. Good amounts of chicken cooked well. The sauce was nice with a good kick of spice. Plenty of rice - this was a winner. Enough to share.  Another bright spot was my Pineapple Mojito. It came with a bunch of ice but was made pretty strong, as was the dirty martini we had. Bartender was serving well tonight.  Of course the cheesecakes did not disappoint. Smores cheesecake was huge with marshmallows and graham crackers on top. The other cheesecake ordered was the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee cheesecake - excellent. Creamy and not to sweet.  So along the lines of food taste we had two huge strikeouts. I mean I didn't think The Cheesecake Factory could let me down, but tonight it definitely did. Another blow to the dining experience was the overall cleanliness of the restaurant. We were seated next to the kitchen swinging door and the floor was always a mess. I mean if you got up to leave your table you would be ice skating on the grease on the slippery floor. Later I would see busboys dragging bags or cloth bags of trash across the floor - no doubt smearing the slimy filth across customer's walking paths. Gross and actually dangerous. I saw several other patron doing the arms out balance dance.  I was really shocked by the overall experience - especially while dining in the 90210 Beverly Hills restaurant. I have never had such a poor experience at a Cheesecake Factory. Our waitress was fine and had a personality but the dining and food was severely inadequate.

They don't take reservations but there was no line when we arrived (6pm) and we were seated right away!  The tables are so close together that you could hear the conversations of the tables next to you.  There was no private conversation.  People at the next table would chime into our conversation....or ask what we were eating.  We tried the recommended Long Island Tea and it was so good, I had a 2nd.  One was enough.  Very potent and tasty drink.  My guest also tried their signature martini.  The food -- my guest had shrimp pasta and I had the Thai (sweet) salmon.  All top quality with beautiful presentation.  OMG the best salmon I have had!  We indulged in cheesecake but shared one  as they are so big and full of bad calories/fat.  Portions were generous. Although the food was outstanding, it was a bit pricey and I don't think I will return here because of the crowded seating.  You really felt you were sitting at a long table with a bunch of strangers, closer than comfort.

After shopping at William Sonoma and L'Occtaine, I was running on empty.  Was across the restaurant and it was close to 2pm and noticed there wasn't a waiting crowd so I crossed the street and popped in. The hostess, a tall slender elegant Nubian is always very cordial and genuinely nice. I come here infrequently, but she always remembers me and takes a moment to warmly greet, she is the best.  This restaurant is on north Beverly Drive and gets high foot traffic, full of shoppers. The restaurant is always clean and has high turnover so food is relatively fresh. The waiter and servers were all very professional and nice as well. Because of the lovely hostess, waiter and server's professionalism, attentiveness and friendliness, I've increased rating from 2 to 4 star. It's the day before thanksgiving so I'm keeping food intake light and ordered the cup or mushroom soup and the lunch portion of the skinnylicious Cesar salad with grilled chicken sans crotons. The mushroom soup was surprisingly good. Perhaps the skinnylicious option was not a good choice because despite the ample shredded cheese and added fresh black pepper, the entire salad was bland and tasteless. Will NOT order this skinnylicious option ever. The grilled chicken was freshly grilled and was nonetheless edible and should hold me till tomorrow's Thanksgiving feast and subsequent comma...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beverly-hills-2?start=60,3.6,3.33,3.244,2.8000000000000003,3.438
134,Charmagne N.,"Los Angeles, CA",243,130,279.0,1.0,2016-11-28,"Honestly, pretty meh.  We came here for a late lunch around 1:30pm on Sunday. I did expect a wait, after all, this is Cheesecake Factory. And if I'm not mistaken, this Beverly Hills location is the original.   The woman at the front was bustling and trying to take names, and continuously keep track of which tables were available. She told us it'd be a 15 minute wait, but it was more like 30. Not her fault, she was very diligent, but I wish she gave us a more accurate time estimate.  When we were seated, our server came by and asked what we'd like to drink. He brought us our water, and fortunately told us bread was on the way. I was absolutely famished and relieved at the sight of sourdough and honey wheat bread with butter on the side.  Lukewarm, but still very good. We ordered and waited a while for our food.  As we waited I looked around the restaurant. It was cozy, and much smaller than other Cheesecake Factories that I've been. The design of the place seemed simpler too. The walls were still shades of brown, yellow, & orange tones that are familiar to Cheesecake Factory, but there weren't as many intricate and elaborate designs on the walls or of the decor. Just compare this to the Cheesecake Factory, at say, the Grove and you'll see what I mean. It's not a bad thing, just something I noticed.  I noticed we got our food fairly quick at this location, so that is a plus. However, the food was disappointing. I got the Texan rolls which were basically oily fried eggrolls in a weird green sauce that had a bit of hot sauce in it. The way the hot sauce was added to the green sauce made it look like it had been dropped in there by accident which turned me off a little. Kinda gross. The sauce had a pretty weak flavor overall.  A pretty lackluster experience which was made worse by an annoying bratty little boy who obnoxiously laughed and yelled and took pictures of everyone in the restaurant. Call me a bit heartless, but one can only take so much of a little boy going up to one's table and taking pictures of the people there, very up close. It gets annoying after it's gone on for an hour and a half. Not the restaurant's fault, the waiters seemed annoyed with him too, but it really ruined the experience for me even further. Definitely not coming back.  So factors of the long wait, annoying brat, lackluster food, and blah experience contributed to why I didn't think the food was worth the price (standard pricing for all cheesecake factories, but I usually don't have a bad time) and why I gave a bad review. Sorry! Won't be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beverly-hills-2?start=20,3.44,3.31,3.236,2.468,3.362

There's no sensible way in our out without hip-checking people into walls. Hard. And today I watched someone piloting a double-wide stroller run over a dog's foot. Twice. (Bonus puzzle: Why was there a dog inside?) We got seated at an outdoor table, which was perfect at 6:30pm. The food, as it always is, was good. But it was so hard to get it!  I ordered the Vietnamese fresh rolls (the rice-paper-wrapped things with veggies and shrimp in them), which couldn't come without onions because they're already pre-made. Same with the avocado spring rolls. I get it; that's okay. The standardization in their menu is honestly part of what makes CF so reliably good.  We didn't get bread when we sat down, so we asked for it. It took a little while to get our drink orders taken, and when the drinks arrived, we asked for bread again. After five more minutes, we flagged someone down and asked for bread again. When the waiter came to take our order, he mentioned that bread was on the way. He took our order and bread arrived a minute later. In the time it took to bring our basket to the table, they ran out of brown bread; the table behind us couldn't have any until they brought them a basket...with dessert.  After our food had taken about 20 minutes to come out, I asked our waiter for an update. He said he'd check. Five minutes later, he brought all the food but the fresh rolls. I asked how a pre-made item could be delayed, and he said it was because too many people had ordered...salads? They came out about five minutes later and were delicious of course--but what the heck is going on at this location? I had to ask twice for a water refill. Then my glass sat empty for the second half of our meal.  We were sitting with empty plates for so long that I had to get up to go ask our waiter for the check. He brought it and I just handed him a large bill so that we wouldn't have to wait an hour for him to come back to get the money and then another hour for him to give us change.  Because it was basically a game at this point, I actually timed how long it took him to come back with change. I tried to hold out for 15 minutes, but after 13, I went inside AGAIN to get my change. I saw him counting bills at the register so I came back out to our table.  Two minutes later--we made 15 after all!--he arrived with the change. At least it was counted correctly.

Tonight, well, was down the tubes and our swan song.   My wife's turkey avocado sandwich came with no bacon, a skimpy bit of turkey, no avocado and ice cold. When sent back, it took ""forever"" for it to return (we all finished our meals before it returned). The ""manager"" A.E. came over to try and say it was correct, but after a small ""discussion"", apologized and acknowledged the order was wrong (the server never did). A.E. offered to do it again or comp it, along with a hot fudge sundae (appropriate). No hot fudge sundae ever arrived. When my wife asked A.E.about the lost sundae her response was ""I didn't say I'd comp that.""  Huh? We heard it. It's one thing to make an offer - another to dodge the issue. We're done. Patrons who stand in line may not take notice here, but management should put some more effort in their training.  Plenty of other places to eat in BH for residents.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beverly-hills-2?start=40,2.8,3.11,3.112,2.212,2.9859999999999998

The tourist dining people next to me almost put his backpack on me, but it's Beverly Hills that space is very precious and expensive so I understand why the super cramped seatings.  It was a very warm day so we decided to do something refreshing and light. Bourbon and Honey cocktail for me, strawberry lemonade for sister, we shared crab cake bites and Greek salad as apps, Tuscan chicken from skinnylicious and chicken & shrimp in Thai curry with white rice for entrees. As usual, food portions were huge and the flavors were rich that we enjoyed all the dishes. We finished our meal with toasted marshmallow S'mores cheesecake, cappuccino and Grey Goose espresso martini, they were very tasty.  Our server was very attentive and friendly considering how busy it was, we have always liked The Cheesecake Factory, this location didn't disappoint either.

233,Wok C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,25,33.0,1.0,2017-07-12,"'this location suckssssss, big time.' I don't know who the 'to go' section think they are but every time i pick up whoever is on duty SUCK!!! Excuse my French of that I am part of but I cannot refrain my anger with this place tonight, Mon.10th July 2017. Customers take note what I've seen while awaiting a pick up order. I have seen staff swipe spilt fries back onto plates with their bare hands. I have seen food plates returned to kitchen counter for whatever reason get swiped onto another order e.g broccoli, potatoes, and don't get me started on how the bread is grabbed and just dumped into baskets. I have seen food orders reheated. e.g a plate of shrimp scampi was returned, apparently cold and it was thrown into a pan to reheat and use for another order. I have seen cooks drop stuff on the floor behind kitchen counter and pick up and use without cleaning. I saw a server sneeze/cough over food. I have seen a cheesecake decorator lick her fingers. But what got to me tonight is being lied to and then lying to. I clearly asked a woman in the pick up corner for a order. She clearly said, it isn't quite ready yet.  I txt the person who ordered and she's upset cos she was told her order was ready 30mins ago. I hand the phone over to the lady who I spoke to and she tells the person the order has been ready.  So, here we go ... We get into it and the woman at Cheesecake Factory pushes the order to me and that was it. The nerve of this woman, at 'to go' section to lie to me and the person who ordered didn't surprise me cos ive heard workers in this section make up lies to customers picking up or ordering. And this was the last time for me.  I've waited at sugarfish locations up to 1hr to 1hr15mins but at least the staff keeps it real with you on wait time. The only reason this location has customers is bcos it's the least expensive place in Beverly Hills with big portions and a semi ok menu for a average price range when your trying to eat out with a family but not spend $500. Check your utensils, plates and cups people. I'd question the sterilization of everything at this location.  The cooks can't keep up with the pace of orders and customers need to be told the truth of wait time that is 45mins from time of order when place is busy and not lied to that the crappy food has been ready.  Ridiculous. HIGHLIGHT: The host section and the bar section is the only organized and friendly staff you come across. SO, if anything eat at the bar, you'll always be pleased with the bartenders on duty. By the way, I have the name of the lady from Monday night.  I'll be courteous enough to not call you out woman but mark my words, one day a customer will go off at you on site. Your too much of a liar and idiot for my time to waste. This location needs a health inspector to walk in random to review. And that's where my complaint on Yelp is going. Tourists/visitors/locals go to another location or pay a lil more to eat clean well prepped and made food.  Better than the rubbish served at this CFactory. I will never go to this location ever again.  And from the low star rating by many on Yelp I'm not the only one.  Ive only ever stopped by because it's the closest location to my location.  It use to be a cool handy spot so that one could enjoy site seeing after eating.  Now it's CRAP! Please note: guest services do not attempt to reach out on my review cos I've seen that's all you do but no changes are made.   #can'tstopwon'tstop",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beverly-hills-2?start=40,2.92,3.16,3.1,2.116,3.0640000000000005

When we walked in you could tell the host was not excited to seat us, then we had a server, Graham. We ordered our drinks then 15 minutes later (still no drinks) He came to take our order?? (still no drinks) then took our order and 20 mins pass (still no drinks) My bf had to get up and ask another server for our few waters and a couple cokes. We FINALLY got our drinks but still had some missing for another 15 mins, my mom desperately needed a water and didn't receive it until after she got her food. Not to mention that this guy had a horrible attitude and was super disrespectful (slamming things down, etc) And also little things with our food that we made clear to him came out wrong as well. The manager came out without us even asking and she didn't seem to care about what was going on.

As soon as our waiter came in, we ordered all our drinks and food because at that point, we were starving.  The two glasses of wine came out first and the glass was disgusting. There were what looked like pieces of food from someone else's mouth that had drank out of the wine glass prior to being given to us... but we ignored it since our waiter was nowhere to be found anyways. Our waiter was nice, but not very attentive. I guess there was really no need since we had everything we needed, but no follow up on how we were doing. Regardless, the service was just okay.

It was about a 15-20 minute wait, normal for any of their locations. I tried ordering the Eggplant Parm, and was told they were out. I've NEVER been to a Cheesecake Factory and been told they're out of the eggplant. WTF! Then I ordered a pasta dish and was completely disappointed with it. Our food took super long to arrive. We ordered our dinner at the same time as the table next to us, but got our food about 20-30 minutes after! I won't hold the server responsible for this because, it's not his fault. Has to be the management.  I had just spent 4 days in the field, with very little rest and proper food. Super annoying when you go to a chain restaurant and expect consistency, but it's nowhere to be found. The slippery floors near their kitchen should be addressed immediately. It's very slippery to walk on, and you'll find your chair sliding around when seated. No joke....it's a lawsuit waiting to happen. I was in such a bad mood, I couldn't wait to get out of there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beverly-hills-2,2.6,2.85,3.056,,2.75

224,James A.,"Manhattan, NY",9,456,213.0,1.0,2017-11-25,"The last time I ate here was about a year or maybe two ago....  There were cockoraches in our booth, in the day time, which represents a large infestation.   It was completely disgusting.  The restaurant knew about the issue and tried to blame the connected commercial spaces.  Regardless, they had cockoraches and all the money they are making, they should only have the absolute best cleaning start and absolute best pest control service, but apparently they do not.   The manager moved us to the opposite side of the restaurant and didn't charge us for our dinner, because they were embarrassed.   As much as I love cheesecake factory and how they tried to make us forget about dining with cockroaches, in good conscience, I cannot go back to this location, knowing that their level of sanitation is inadequate or else they wouldn't have cockroaches.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beverly-hills-2?start=40,2.68,2.84,3.052,,2.7760000000000002

I don't like to send food back, because I fear repercussions from the chefs.  I called the manager and explained what happened, she just made excuses. I'm done with this place. I'll have my celebrations some place else. This was special to me, she was visiting from out of state.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beverly-hills-2?start=40,2.6,2.84,3.048,,2.744

I love the patio here too.  Fun for people watching and surprisingly comfortable.  Parking can be a pain but that is to be expected in this area of Beverly hills, and the wait for seating... was outrageous.  Again though, to be expected.  If you want easy parking and no-line-seating, go to Calabasas!  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beverly-hills-2,2.76,2.84,3.052,,2.808

She got to me in a timely manner for everything from the greeting all the way to when I was finished. The food of course was a amazing as well. Fresh, well cooked and delicious. For a Sunday night, there was a good amount of traffic so the environment was very upbeat and fun. Highly recommend this place!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beverly-hills-2?start=20,2.92,2.84,3.052,,2.872
251,Ser B.,"Burbank, CA",21,19,45.0,4.0,2017-12-10,"I have been here several times before, and it took me a while to get familiar with the menu as a Vegan. My first time, I had the Cobb salad which is raw amazing food that everyone can enjoy but, I feel like it's more of a huge appetizer or a finger food that everyone can eat. As I got more comfortable, I decided to get something hot and big plate category; Evelyn's Favorite Pasta(hold the Parmesan and ask to be tossed in olive oil instead of butter). This pasta is amazing! I would never ever ever compare it to a real pasta ""ITALIAN"" but, it comes a little close to desired Italian pasta. The waiters are always kind and informative... though I have to say, the wait time to be served is a little bit on the longer side than usual. Overall, I like how you can go to Cheesecake Factory and welcome yourself with their menu. They offer so many options like, Soy-Glazed Edamame, Vegan Cobb Salad, Veggie Burger(Ask for sourdough or wheat bread and replace cheese and mayo with avocado), Kale and Quinoa Salad(hold the Parmesan), Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, and Falafel Salad(Skip the feta and choose vinaigrettes: lemon-blueberry, pomegranate, or shallot that are vegan) Overall, the experience here is good and I could see myself being a regular here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beverly-hills-2,3.0,2.87,3.06,,2.9220000000000006

The ladies that sat us were really nice, we asked to chance tables and they were awesome about it. I had a chicken Bellagio today, it is one of my favorite specialty pasta. Too bad I just remembered the picture after I have already ate half of my plate. So I decided not taking it, next time I go I take it. Love how the  Cheesecake Factory plates taste the same in all restaurants.  Summing up, good service and awesome food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beverly-hills-2,3.16,2.88,3.06,,2.9920000000000004

At the end of our meal she showed up with a few other servers and surprised my parents with an ice cream sundae and said ""I heard it is your 59th wedding anniversary and you are an inspiration to all of us. We wanted you to have this."" My parents and I were so touched by this act of kindness. I had not requested anything from the restaurant as we did celebrate their anniversary last week; however, today is my parent's actual anniversary, so this was so special and very much appreciated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beverly-hills-2?start=20,3.32,2.88,3.068,,3.056
138,Jim S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,39,,3.0,2017-12-22,I guess I would rate it ok.  Most of the food coming out to tables looked good.  I was there for happy hour and ordered medium burger with fries.  The burger arrived well done not medium like I ordered and the fries arrived once I almost finished the burger.  So they need to work on timing and making sure that you get your meal the way you order it.  Might be worth going back one more time before making a final judgement. If they want a 20% tip in addition to salary then they better get the order right and delivered on time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beverly-hills-2?start=20,3.24,2.9,3.06,,3.0360000000000005

244,Fifi P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,6,,1.0,2017-12-31,"We came for the Romano crusted chicken breast, left for the bizarrely incompetent hosting staff. Instead of directing my family to wait outside, our hostess conducted a plaintive discussion with her coworkers about how it made her look bad that we were standing inside. I had no idea we'd done the wrong thing, and a simple ""Sorry, we need to keep this area clear, please wait on the sidewalk"" would have sufficed. We weren't there to spite her; we had a five minute wait and thought we were supposed to stay close. I get it; hostessing is hard (it is, I've done it). Maybe she has hungry, grouchy jerks coming in all day long (we weren't those people). Maybe working at a chain restaurant in Beverly Hills makes her feel small, and she wanted to make someone else feel small, too (mission accomplished). Maybe she thought we were dumb tourists, or that we lacked a thorough grasp of loudly broadcasted, passive-aggressive English. Maybe she was just bad at her job. I don't know, and we didn't stick around to find out. At the conclusion of their bitch sesh, another hostess led us to a table in the middle of a room with empty booths and we waited a polite two minutes before leaving. Sorry, Server - you can thank Friday's 5pm shift for that one. Stay classy Beverly Hills Cheesecake Factory hostesses.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beverly-hills-2,3.04,2.88,3.056,,2.9440000000000004
