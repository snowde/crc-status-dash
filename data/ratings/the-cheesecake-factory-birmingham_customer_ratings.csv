160,Christopher W.,"Las Vegas, NV",98,91,4.0,3.0,2013-01-01,"Cheesecake factory is always a great spot to turn to when you either have limited options or just want a good dessert.  A friend and I had lunch here today, and while the quality of food is always good, to me it's somewhat subpar at times.  For instance, I ordered the southwest chicken sandwich with a side salad.  The sandwich was completely overloaded with avocado and salsa that the unique taste of the sandwich was lost within.  The jalapeno peppers I requested never arrived... and my side salad came out with the wrong dressing.  Once I removed the chicken from the bread to eat it by itself it tasted just like you would expect from a cooked chargrilled chicken patty that has been frozen and then reheated for serving. My friend ordered the meatloaf sandwich... and I will just say that the butter from the bread was so overpowering that it really was difficult to eat.  And the side of mashed potatoes he ordered was sent back twice because they were so cold.  The gravy that accompanied was even colder. The two slices of cheesecake we each had was, of course, absolutely phenomenal!  If I were rating the dessert alone it would be 5-stars - no question about it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-birmingham?start=140,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004

Obviously I'm in the minority in my opinion, but when I go out I want meals that I can't make better at home. And I'm not a fan of oversized portions, which are de rigeur here.

The service was fast and pretty good.  No complaints there. It is pricey though, even at lunch.  Just the pasta with water was $12 - and that's not including the tip.

I ordered the firecracker salmon wrap for $1 more than the low-calorie salmon wrap. The low-calorie salmon wrap was noted as using butter or cream.  I was confused as to how this low-calorie wrap could be healthier than the other wrap.  I asked the waiter what is the difference between the two.  He said the firecracker wrap was bigger.  I did not feel like he had a good answer.  My dishes was loaded with lettuce garnish.

I got the greek salad and turkey avocado sandwich.  The salad was ok.  A little bit of arugula topped with a lot of tomatoes and thick cut cucumbers, kalamata olives and some feta cheese.  The sandwich was loaded with turkey meat, but it was incredibly dry and tasteless.  The bacon that was on it was old and rubbery. The dessert menu is as extensive as the dinner menu.  We went with the simple cheesecake with strawberries.  It was delicious.  The slices are huge, so we shared this as well.

The interior is spacious, even lavish.  It should be great, right? Service is attentive & pleasant. No issues there. There's only one problem: the food pretty much sucks. I daresay that if you served this food in a 'hole in the wall' type of location, it would be out of business in a month. Most of this stuff seems to have originated in a can, mix, or freezer. It can either be bland, too sweet, or too spicy. The 'green salad' consists of a bowl of lettuce doused in lousy bland dressing. The 'chicken mushroom lettuce wraps' are grossly overseasoned. It's not cheap, either. I don't mind paying for good food.  This is not good food. Cheesecake Factory was probably good when it started, many years ago. Then it became more of a ""factory"" (hey, at least they are honest). It's an example of a chain restaurant that has embraced mediocrity and style over substance. There may be some desirable items on the menu, but I've had no luck finding them. I really don't understand dining here when there are so many better options in Birmingham.

There was no wait for the patio so coworker and I decided to sit outside. It was nice out today! Sat down, got some bread (which weren't warm as they usually are, the sourdough usually looses its warmth quick but neither roll was warm) opened the napkin roll to get a knife, only to find out my napkin had been used and the silverware was rolled with crumbs. Odd?! Now my coworkers napkin was clean but it had crumbs in it as well... Oh well Maybxe it fell in the basket of bread along with some shrimp tail and sauce on my napkin....gross! While waiting for our food i saw that the table next to us was being prepped the guy was arranging the little plates...then i noticed (through the window and glare! might i add) that one of the plates was obviously dirty...they guy ignored it and placed the napkin over it logistically so you wont notice any of that gunk!. I wasnt tripping that SHHHT WAS DIRTY. Like i just had a salad with some tomatoes and green onions dirty! It wasn't just a speck. I cant believe he just ignored it like it wasnt there, like no one would notice. Seriously?! You're that lazy? To add they forgot the onion strings on my salad :( why? it's like the best part. Crunchy unhealthy fried onions mmmmm :) so the expediter wasnt any help which their case.  I asked for the manager and told him about the nasty napkin and the nasty plate that was on the booth inside next to us...By then a lovely family had sat down on that booth but the lady wasnt having any bread lol so she hasn't seen the NASTY plate. The manager swiftly went to the table and grabbed all the plates from that table. Good job! Other than that i really dont know if he talked to his employee... He told me that the prep their utensils outside of their kitchen area. I told him maybe they should pick a more sanitary place to work and roll those napkins. Oh and if you wanted to know the manager did comp our food, not that we cared for him to do that.

As you walk in, you might be greeted by a half-smile from the hostess who is doing her best to accommodate having to find seats for paying customers, when I suspect she really wants to just pull out her phone and take another selfie. We wait a few minutes, not long, and led to our table. Our waiter takes our drink orders. He's friendly and courteous. We have kids with us, so being nice to them will earn you bonus points (ahem, bigger tip). We peruse through the Cheesecake Factory Encyclopedia or better known as ""Menu."" You name it. Italian, Asian, American...it's a United Nations of culinary delight. I settled on the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, a little Thai craving. It was a peanut-infused, coconut, curry sensation. It wasn't overpowering, but it also wasn't bland. The only critique I have is too much pepper on the shrimp. I almost did a little chair dance.  Others in my party ordered the Buffalo Blasters, and those blasted his socks off. I think he actually did a little chair dance, or his butt was asleep. Who knows. He loved it. Another one in my party ordered the Salmon Wraps. She said they sucked. To be fair, they were on the skinny menu. For this fluffy chick, most things on the skinny menu are inedible. I guess that's why skinny chicks stay skinny. So she ordered the Salmon BBQ, which she loved. I guess that's what she mumbled while nom-nom-nom. The kids ordered everything from sliders to Fettuccine Alfredo. For them, if it comes with ketchup, they're happy. Then came dessert and where this overrated place earned four stars. My fat cells definitely did the Macarena when I had some of the Dulce de Leche. It was rich yet light with hints of caramel, vanilla, and freakin' awesomeness.

71,Joshua S.,"Trussville, AL",62,106,614.0,4.0,2014-06-30,"Consistent. ALWAYS consistently great! The cheese cake factory started out selling cheesecake. They expanded the business with meals and kept the cheesecake. The reality is that most people go for the entrees and the cheesecake is just a bonus. I rarely even eat cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory.  I mentioned the Cheesecake Factory is consistent. My other favorite attribute is the expansive menu. Most restaurant cut down on menu items to help a kitchen produce more smoothly and efficiently. At the Cheesecake Factory you pay a bit more but you got a ton of menu options . The expansive menu is great for groups because there is something for everyone.  The food is generally very good. I find that the cheese cake factory is better than other more specialized restaurants. For example, the Cheesecake Factory can make better Cajun inspired cuisine than a Cajun restaurant. (Such as Cajun steamer) The interior is nicely decorated; the lightly is casual and comfortable. They have outdoor seating which is nice during the evening when the sub sets. A few things enter my mind when considering flaws. First, the menu is full of advertisements. Second, it's a bit more expensive for comparable dishes at other restaurants . Finally , it gets very crowded and the wait can get pretty long on the weekends.  In conclusion, the cheesecake is a great ""go-to"" spot for friends and family. They have something to satisfy everyone, and they do so consistently.

63,Raye B.,"Birmingham, AL",100,189,353.0,4.0,2015-10-25,"Who knew happy hour could be this happy! We were clearly distracted as our sole purpose for even going to the factory was to share a slice of cheesecake in the midst of our celebration. We however, got lured in and found our way to a high top table in the bar area. The happy hour menu danced in our faces with TONS of reasonably priced/shareable options. We were pleased to see low cocktail prices and ordered a few (cosmo and iced tea). My, oh my, compliments to the bartender- his concoctions were made promptly and tasty. While we were waiting, though we knew we only wanted cheesecake, we went ahead and ordered the buffalo blast appetizer. WHY- we only wanted cheesecake, but still managed to be led by our sense of instant hunger. Needless to say, they were good and gone in 45 minutes between the two of us. We agree the blasts might as well be a full meal versus an appetizer- they are so filing and CF definitely doesn't skimp on quantity. I would recommend an order of these and maybe a side item or side salad as your meal. Though full, we finally ordered our white chocolate raspberry cheesecake......to go! Overall, I would say that Cheesecake Factory has one of the best happy hours in town with lots of app/snack/meal options as well as a special bar menu. The restaurant crowd was not obnoxious by far, but rather quiet. If you can make it down 280 between 4-6pm M-F, you're sure to leave happy, stuffed or worse; both.

On another note their service was pretty on top of their game, and continuously refilled our drinks. They seemed pretty organized even though it was fairly busy.

79,Emily S.,"Dolomite, AL",118,19,,2.0,2016-01-09,"I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory but I cannot rate higher than 2 stars for my latest experience. First, let me clarify that I work in the restraunt industry and I am also an avid cook. I know food prep and I know when its bad. We called ahead and were quoted a 45-1 hour wait but when we got there, we were quoted 20-30 which was excellent. However, we were seated at an incredibly small table where one wall was booths and the other were chairs. Besides the 2 of us, there were 3 other people on the booth seating and it was cramped to say the least. I understand you want to seat as many tables as possible, but breaking up a 4 top for a 2 top is not a solution when they have no elbow room. Bread and butter were meager, disappointing as they used to have harty portions. We placed our orders after much debate--he got catfish, I got some pasta (can't recall the name, it was a penne pasta with mushrooms and wine sauce.) I asked to substitute noodles for angel hair and our server was happy to do so. Sadly, my pasta was AWFUL. The noodles were so overcooked, it was hard to chew them they were so sticky and crunchy all at one. The sauce was also improperly reduced and still had a bitter, acrid aftertaste that told me they had not cooked out the alcohol. After lots of debate, I finally sent it back and ordered a burger instead. The burger was good, but I asked for it to be cooked medium well and it was well done to say the least. My fiance's catfish was good but he found multiple ""corn hairs"" in his vegetables (which tells me they did not shuck the corn properly) and his fish's breading fell away when he touched a piece. Really disappointing, considering our bill was about $70 with the tip. The only reason this isn't 1 Star is because our server was superb. I believe her name was Charlie---long blond hair, very sweet. She was very apologetic and speedy and kept our drinks full.

I had avocado toast (from the ""Superfood"" menu) and the Samosas from the ""Small Plate"" menu.  The trick, I think, with avocados is to be generous with seasonings, as they have such a mild flavor.  Sadly, CF didn't really focus on seasoning, or texture.  The plate looked beautiful, with cherry tomatoes cut in half over the green mashed avocado, and artfully-placed radishes sprinkled over the concoction.  The toast underneath, however, was too thick and tough for an easy bite and the load of avocado mash on top tumbled off with each bite.  The Samosas were pretty nondescript - small and quite oily, with a strong curry powder flavor. Two of my daughters got burgers which were delicious - and fries that were the best.  We took home one entire burger.  My other daughter got the cup of homemade mushroom soup and the da Vinci pasta, both of which were good, if perhaps a bit over-salted. The tab came to almost $75, and with tip was $90.  Quite an expensive for a very average experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-birmingham?start=20,3.2,3.47,3.47,3.0520000000000005,3.362

We started off with the Eggroll Sampler for our appetizer. The sampler comes with halves of Cuban egg roll (my favorite), Tex Mex egg roll, Avocado egg roll and Firecracker Salmon egg roll. Each roll is served with an accompanying sauce.   My mom ordered the Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo and I ordered the Tuscan Chicken (located in the Skinnylicious menu). I tried to lessen the caloric damage between the fried eggrolls and the highly anticipated cheesecake. Lol. The gumbo was amazing! I like that you can choose between white and brown rice. The dish had a great taste to it and the pieces of sausage gave it the perfect kick.  The Tuscan Chicken has a variety of flavors. Very light tasting and easy on the calories. The chicken was a tad bit tough. My only major gripe about this dish is the balsamic vinaigrette is very pungent and overpowers the dish. I only tasted the balsamic in the tomatoes, which came in abundance, so I don't know if they are marinated in the vinaigrette prior or what but I'm pretty sure my mouth puckered with every bite. Other than that the dish served its Mediterranean purpose (fresh basil, capers, farro, artichokes and etc) and it is definitely a fulfilling meal considering it's less than 600 calories.

7,Chris W.,"Helena, AL",605,406,1621.0,3.0,2017-06-21,"This place has the largest most diverse menu of any restaurant I've visited. It's wildly popular and despite its immense size there is almost always a wait. The menu storage area must occupy a significant portion of their square footage. I've enjoyed most everything I've had, though nothing has been particularly special or had me racing back. This place reminds me of a better version of an Appleby's or TGI Friday's at 2x the price. Tonight my wife's sister and her family took my wife to dinner. My wife is a fan of this place, I think for the selection alone. My wife brought me fish and chips. This dinner portion is huge! The fish was thick and flaky with a tempura style beer batter. The Tatar sauce was good with a hint of lemon. The chips were soggy bag variety fries.  She subbed the slaw  for crisp sautéed green beans. They were ok.... I personally prefer my green beans cooked for a day with pork fat. The fish and tarter sauce now stand out; however,  what really stands out the most is the nutritional information for this menu item. Ever exceeded all of your caloric intake in a day with one meal?  The Cheesecake Factory's Beer Battered Fish and Chips: 2,260 calories as well as 68 grams of saturated fat and 2,870 milligrams of sodium.  That's what 125% of your daily recommended sodium intake?? In the future I will google  nutritional information prior to ordering. Upon further further inspection a number of the menu items at this restaurant are widely recognized for their poor nutritional value.

I don't come here often so I get the same thing every time I eat here.  I love the fried mac and cheese. I have had it at several other places and only one place has even come close. Every component of this dish is well done and they come together exactly as I would want it.  For my entree I get the Louisiana chicken pasta with extra sauce. Love it every time and left overs heat up to my liking too. I love dipping up that creamy sauce with bread.   My wife and I usually split a slice of cheesecake.  She likes it plain and I like it funky.  So, how do we split one?  Vanilla bean cheesecake with extra whip cream and a side of raspberry sauce. Those additions are just enough to make it dressed up for me while the simple straight up vanilla bean is just what my wife likes.

A couple of people suggested the cheesecake factory and that sounded good. I had not been to the cheesecake factory in several years so I had really forgotten about the extensive menu. When I called it was going to be an hour and a half wait for our group of eight so we split into two groups of four and was seated within 15 to 20 minutes. The restaurant was packed but still looked very clean. Everyone that we dealt with was very nice and extremely polite. Our waitress was Anna and she was really amazing. On the way to our table a waiter was walking by with two or three dishes that he was about to serve. One of those dishes caught my eye and I said that looks great I wonder what it is? He took the time to turn around and tell me the name of the dish and that's exactly what I ordered. It was Chicken Parmesan Romano with pasta and a light sauce and it was delicious. It was a great evening with some wonderful friends and the restaurant did an excellent job.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-birmingham?start=20,3.72,3.52,3.52,,3.6000000000000005

The food is flavorful, savory, and most importantly- delicious! I honestly felt that the quality (and quantity) of food lived up to the price paid. On the down side, they're tremendously busy, so you may be there waiting for awhile. So far, all the entrees Ive had lived up to the expectations I have set for this establishment. The cheesecake is absolutely phenomenal! Wish I snapped a picture... The environment is also very relaxing and sets a warm ambiance.

I went earlier today and we were seated by a window, which wasn't a problem. The problem was the amount of flies that were in the restaurant by our table (we were inside, not on the patio). I had to kill 4 flies, only to find another 6 before we even received our check. I understand that we were seated by a window, but 10 flies... That's unusual. We asked our waitress, Ashley, if she could just casually mention to the manager that there was a fly problem. Idk if she ever did, but I hope that management sees this so they could maybe do something about that. I felt like I was having to make sure that no flies got in my food the entire time that I was there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-birmingham?start=20,3.76,3.52,3.52,,3.616

The only setbacks during our experience there was that there was our waitress got busy at one point and had forgotten to put in our order for the entrées. She came to our table to apologize and offered us complementary soups while we waited for food. I thought that was really nice of her. Later on, Jimmiesha was kind enough to get us some to-go bowls for our leftovers and, I assume either because of the late order because it was my birthday and she was aware, she only charged us for the drinks and the appetizers. I guess it was her birthday present to me, or a present to make up for the wait.  We ended up tipping $30 on a $12 order that should have been around $50.

(I reluctantly agreed to eat here because last spring they turned our party of 8 away at 3:30 on a weekday. The restaurant was empty. ???)  Good things: server was nice and the fried mac and cheese was just how our daughter likes it.  Not-so-good: fries were undercooked; they sent more that were a bit better, but they still had that raw potato flavor. The strawberry lemonade was thick; like it came from the bottom of the container. At least they took it off our bill.  Total grossness: We killed 4 flies while we were there. In addition, gnats swarmed our food the entire meal. We brought it to the attention of the person who brought our food and his response was, ""Well, it's summertime."" After our meal we asked to speak to the manager. Jennifer came to our table and was of the same opinion. ""We have so many doors and it's hard to keep them out."" We pointed out that it may be a bit easier if tables were bussed and cleaned in a timely manner. 4 tables sat dirty for at least 20 minutes after the customers left. Her response was that they had a large party in another part of the restaurant. She also said she would send over the general manager, but that never happened.  We hoped for a nice meal. Instead we had sub-par food, flies/gnats, and an atmosphere of dirty tables. I expect more when paying $70 for lunch for 3 people. It's a shame.
