160,Joshua S.,"San Diego, CA",198,486,234.0,4.0,2012-04-15,"I avoided Cheesecake Factory's when I lived in California because I thought all they served was cheesecake...and I was really confused why people always flocked there for dinner.   I eventually went to one in Huntington Beach (I should probably write a review) and fell in love with it.  It was the first time I'd ever had a sweet potato fry.  I didn't even know there was such a thing. But I've been to this one about four times now and it's always been a good time.  Granted, it's Boca and I'm not a huge fan of the people in west Boca because I have yet to see someone smile or wave and that's why I enjoy restaurants in Boca, because they HAVE TO wave and be nice!  It's like you see a whole new side of this city...the friendly side :) The nachos are the best.  The are regular old nachos like I used to make in junior high when I would get home from school and watch Duck Tales.  Big chips, cheese, jalapenos, sour cream, and salsa.  Pretty basic but good.   I can't recall the name of it but I get the cheeseburger piled high with onion straws and barbecue sauce.  It's always to die for.  Never had a complaint here.  The best part of the meal is the ultimate margarita.  I think that's what they call it here.  It's the premium one with good tequila.  I always feel that when they say ultimate it will be like Chevy's where you can enjoy it for more than three straw-pulls but they just mean good tequila.  Either way, it's good.  If they enlarged the glass it went in it would be even better.   Definitely check this Cheesecake Factory out when in Boca, if for nothing else, do it to see entitled people SMILE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boca-raton?start=180,3.72,3.72,3.72,3.056,3.7200000000000006

182,Lauran C.,"Miami, FL",18,17,3.0,3.0,2012-07-18,"I would have liked to include a photo here but the website of this chain doesn't avail you of many - except for cheesecakes. I'm into food, not desserts, and I definitely haven't been to that place for dessert - so here goes. I was freaked out by the Cheesecake Factory in Houston many years ago and didn't return. For some reason I ventured into their Boca Raton location some time ago. (The reason for the freak out? The Houston locataion was playing opera music, which I TOTALLY detest. And they were quite unapologetic/accomodating about it. So I steered clear for many years.) Moving on - the Boca Raton location has been a wonderful find for me. Not only do I like their food but the decor is magical. See their website for more details - but basically, art deco, wonderful. Their Boca location is also huge, and most often very full! Quite a feat to pull off. Last Sunday I visited and got my usual - a massive Cobb Salad that really would be big enough for two meals, but it's so delicious I always finish it (and don't eat dinner). Accompanied by a Blue Moon and warm brown bread - delicious. This time around I noticed a lot of things on the menu I'd definitely like to try, like three types of cooked salmon in one dish! In fact the menu is so eclectic I thought it might be a good place to take a date to, despite the fact that because of it's vastness I'd more considered the Cheesecake Factory of more a cafe type place. But that kind of menu can inspire some serious eating. I should have asked if they have a wine list. I guess so. Lastly they played very muted jazz music - wonderful! Definitely a place I like returning to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boca-raton?start=200,3.72,3.72,3.72,2.8600000000000003,3.7200000000000006

All deserts, not just cheesecakes are awesome!!! 5. service/ambiance- beautiful! Clean! Attentive Sunday brunch is served till 2pm and features the greatest sandwich ever invented...the Monte Cristo! Ham, egg, bacon, and cheese squeezed between french toast topped with powdered sugar and a side of strawberry preserves and hash browns! Perfection on a dish! The pancakes and waffles are pretty good too but only served on Sunday.  Martini's are hand-crafted and muddled to order. I LOVE the strawberry martini and the lemon drop. One drink, all vodka, will give you the buzz you are looking for when you order a martini. Steer away from Sangria, it was too juicy and pre-made. This place is always packed but well worth the wait.

The food is great, the portions are enormous. The prices are good for what you get. One of my personal favorite dishes is the caramel chicken. It is always good at any time of year. But i always keep a place near my heard for the miso salmon. From the sweet butter sauce to the tenderness of the salmon. It is amazing. To think such a succulent dish could come out of this place. There are plenty of choices for everyone. I swear the menu seems to contain four hundred pages of meal choices. There is something for everyone here. I would give it five stars but the drinks aren't that great. I ordered a mojito and they seemed to have understood lemonade with crushed mint. This is not the first time this happened.

Luckily, we waited not even 5 minutes for a booth, and our server came to us immediately despite the fact that the restaurant was PACKED We started with the Vietnamese Tacos, and they were awesome! The presentation was fantastic, and they were packed with flavor. The pork was super tender, and it had just the right amount of spice. Oh, and the ""buns"" it was served on were so unique.... fluffy and soft. They reminded me a little bit of Manapua. I ordered the Chile Roja Beef, and it was BY FAR the best dish I've had in a while. The meat was SO tender and was perfectly flavored and topped with peppers and onions that were delicious. The beans were the perfect consistency, and the cilantro rice was a great addition. This dish was served with little corn tortilla bites too, and I really enjoyed making mini ""tacos"" with them. My boyfriend ordered the Orange Chicken (as he ALWAYS does), and it was amazing. Perfectly crispy and had just the right amount of orange, tanginess to it. The rice was steamed and the veggies were awesome. Again, very nice presentation. Of course, being the CHEESECAKE factory, we couldn't leave without cheesecake; however, there was SO much food that we didn't even finish our meals (super rare for us). So, we took it home along with a piece of the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple and finished it off around midnight. The food was still fantastic, and the cheesecake was like a piece of heaven.

In the restaurant's defense, let me say that the cleanliness and ambiance were everything they always have been, and on both occasions my wife thought her meal was almost up to par with CF's usual standards. The first time, I had the Mac & Cheese Burger.  The mac & cheese was dried out and flavorless.  The burger was cooked to my liking, but must have sat waiting way too long to be picked up by the server, as it was only room temperature by the time it reached our table.  The meat was also dry.  To top it all off,  the bun was stale.  It was the first time ever at CF that I couldn't finish the whole meal, because it was just no good. The second time, last night, I ordered Fish Tacos.  Our server asked if I would like the fish broiled or crispy.  I asked if the crispy fish was deep fried.  He said no, it just has a light tempura batter that makes it crispy.  So crispy is how I ordered it.  When it showed up, it had clearly been deep fried, which I pointed out to the server, and he said ""yes, of course,"" like we had never had the first conversation at all.  It was also immediately obvious that $14 for four very tiny fish tacos is an unbelievable rip off.  Taco Bell sells better looking food!  As soon as I picked up the first one of these tiny little tacos, the flour tortilla broke into four or five pieces because it was so dried out.  The diced over-ripe tomatoes had obviously come from a container that had a lot of water in it, and that made the texture of the dried out tortilla seem very runny, cheap, and utterly disgusting.  They need to take this item off the menu, and never bring it back. Tonight we ate at Pollo Tropical, and I must say the quality of the food was far superior to the crap I had last night at Cheesecake Factory!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boca-raton?start=180,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.7920000000000007,3.3200000000000003

113,Brian R.,"Boca Raton, FL",900,1223,4090.0,4.0,2015-03-10,"Let's start with the fact that I don't generally like chain restaurants. That being said, this particular chain is better than most because it seems to be able to hire and train chefs who can execute consistently at a higher level. It's not 4 star against say, 32 East, but in the category of solid chain restaurants that are upscale, it's one of the best.  Their Skinnylicious menu in particular keeps me coming back because it is low enough calorie without compromising taste.   I'm immune to the rack of devastatingly good looking cheesecakes because they do cold-pour and I'm a NYC baked kind of guy. Otherwise I'm sure I'd be in the CA meetings (Cheesecake Anonymous). One of the things that chain restaurants suffer from are lower quality ingredients when you have to buy in that kind of quantity. Unlike Brio which is Olive Garden on steroids, the Cheesecake Factory is a very nice scale restaurant.  There are small things, like the ever-flowing stream of waitstaff that is not often as well schooled in the menu, or customer service, and occasional product issues like leaving artichokes, which are seasonal, on the menu year-round, which requires them to buy from suppliers of product that is small, hard, and less optimal.  Costing them a star? The Cheesecake Factory plays the game of marking up the suggested tip (15%, 18% 20%) on the bill to include tipping for the sales tax. Tipping is always done off the SUBTOTAL, NOT the total.  That's a rip-off of the consumer because they assume they can't add or will not check. I brought it to the manager's attention, but he has to kick it up the McLine to corporate which installed and placed the system so I'm not holding my breath on the customer responsiveness. The place is constantly busy, but they do move traffic well so it generally is not an issue. Be prepared to wait though on average 10-30 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boca-raton?start=80,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.024,3.3200000000000003

During this last visit, our food came out exceptionally fast and tasted great. You're allowed to order a smaller portion before 5PM. I usually never make it in before that but when I do I love to take advantage as its cheaper and more reasonable to what you can eat. The shrimp bistro pasta is my favorite entree from this chain. The only improvement the dish can use is that the shrimp is breaded. When eating it, you will realize that you're eating all breading as the shrimp is very petite. Nevertheless, as a pasta lover - this dish is deliciously made with a light sauce and mushrooms.  The Asian chicken chopped salad is also a must. Perfectly presented and satisfying due to its size. A lot of hit appetizers I have tried but I personally didn't like their loaded potato tots. The ingredients felt too mixed where you can't differentiate the flavors.

However, I was very disappointed about the cheesecake. I have been to multiple cheesecake factory locations and my favorite cheesecake is the banana cream. By far the best in my opinion and usually my favorite part of actually going to the cheesecake factory. Me and my girlfriend wanted to split a piece and she had never had this one before and told her she had to try it and raved about it. However, the piece they gave me was not fresh at all. The bananas were brown and could tell this has been sitting a while maybe a couple days. Definitely didnt taste how it normally does. The waiter (forget his name) asked how everything was and told him that this cheesecake was awful and told him it wasnt fresh. He says ""sorry we didnt have any fresh pieces of banana cream. That's all we had left. I apologize."" Then he walks away?!?! He didnt even offer to give me a different piece of cheesecake. Are you kidding me?! Was very upset.

I have literally never been to this location of Cheesecake Factory and not had to wait. Lunch, dinner, late night, in-season, out of season; it doesn't matter, it's permanently packed here. Come expecting to hang out for a little bit before you get seated, because it can take a long time. Atmosphere here is on par with the other locations, which is to say it's very nice. I find the booths a bit small for four people. The floor layout is huge, and they do everything they can to cram as many people as possible in. Everything here is big, including the parking lot outside. While this place is often crowded, they have a massive parking lot; and even though it's right next to mall, their is plenty of spots. I've never really gotten anything here I don't enjoy here, all the food is great. Portion size is quite big, and plenty usually to take home for later. The Crispy Chicken Costoletta is totally fantastic, and must try. Chicken Picatta is also a favorite of mine. The cheesecakes are also a must, despite their price. Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake is my favorite for what it's worth. The only real pitfall to Cheesecake Factory are the prices, which are very high, nothing here is cheap.

8,Adriana R.,"West Palm Beach, FL",103,49,291.0,4.0,2016-04-28,"I ate lunch here with my friend on Friday, March 25. We have a tradition of catching up over lunch or dinner at a Cheesecake Factory location. Like all of our meals at The Cheesecake Factory, we enjoyed it. Our waiter was attentive and accommodating, and the food was delicious. Our total visit was just short of two hours, and we could tell toward the end that they were trying to hint to us to leave. [Clarification: Another user misunderstood this sentence of my review, so I re-worded it. We did not chat for an additional two hours after eating. Rather, our total visit was two hours. I think that is pretty reasonable considering the time it took to get our drinks, look at the menu, order, get our food, eat our food, order cheesecake for dessert, eat our cheesecake, get the bill, and then pay the bill.] By the way, if you ever order a dish that includes rice, ask your waiter to substitute the rice for mashed potatoes or something. The rice at The Cheesecake Factory is the worst rice I have ever tasted - a weird texture and very bland. On that note, the Orange Chicken dish I ordered normally comes with rice and broccoli, I believe. I had the waiter substitute the rice for mashed potatoes, and the broccoli for sautéed onions and carrots. Delicious! One thing I love about The Cheesecake Factory is how accommodating they are - they will substitute components of a dish without any problem (and without an extra charge).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boca-raton?start=40,3.72,3.41,3.41,2.8320000000000003,3.5340000000000003

102,Tiffany G.,"Broward, FL",98,253,125.0,5.0,2016-05-01,"I absolutely love The Cheesecake Factory. In fact, I'd list it in my top 5 favorite restaurants! This is because I know what to order when I come here.. I know what their best dishes are!! I used to frequent this restaurant more often back in the day when it was closer to where I spent my afternoons. Back then, I was able to sample a majority of the menu and I was able to rule out many dishes you should definitely not order. After some experience, I was able to come with friends and when someone would try to order the Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, per say, I would advise against it. Not their strength, and if you ask me, that one should have been removed from the menu a long time ago...oily and tasteless... Not every dish here is their strength, but knowing the ones that are make for a guaranteed amazing meal here!! Unfortunately, The Cheesecake Factory likes to remodel their menu often. I have noticed they tend to keep some of their items that aren't so great but remove some pretty great ones!! Still not sure why this is so and who makes these decisions?? RIP to their roasted veggie and goat cheese pizza (flavor was amazing!!!), their shrimp and bacon club sandwich, The grilled portobello on a bun, and most recently noticed.. The White chocolate blueberry cheesecake!! Luckily, they left a few good ones.. Since I don't frequent the place as often anymore, I'm not as familiar with many of their new items.. I plan to try a few at some point!! I came for dinner tonight and left super happy wanting to give them 10 stars if I could..so here are some items I recommend!!! We started with the avocado egg rolls  (such a classic here) and the crispy Cuban rolls for appetizers. The eggrolls are amazing in the sauce they come with and the Cuban rolls which weren't around when I used to frequent the place back in the day have recently become a favorite of mine!! Delicious!!! Now take notes here and thank me later......For my entrée, I ordered the Miso Salmon BUTTT I ordered it with no rice and replaced the rice with mashed potatoes instead AND I ordered extra sake butter and extra miso glaze on the side (for you to add at will while eating)!!! These changes are an absolute must!! I have friends and family call me all the time when dining here to ask just how I order it since it's so amazing this way!!! I practically moaned my whole way through dinner!! ....and this is coming from someone who rarely orders a salmon dinner anywhere! .. By far my favorite one!! For dessert on this particular evening, We decided to try a cheesecake I have never tried here before.. The Oreo!! It did not disappoint and quickly went to my top favorites!! Just a note as well I did not order these on this visit.. But I am also obsessed with their Santa Fe salad and their Fresh Vegetable salad (this one is in salad apps).. I often get extra of the dressings that come with each on the side since they are so incredible!!  ..and you really can't go wrong with any of their cheesecakes!

Before I start with the negative, let me give recognition where is due to our server ""Danielle D."" - what a super star you have working for your establishment.  She over did her self and went above and beyond to do something that a manager should have done.  She was the one who offered us a complimentary cheesecake for the issues we had with 2 of our dish.   I am a long time customer of the Cheesecake Factory and I can honestly say the last 2 times I went was disappointing when it comes to the food. Today was worst than ever.  We ordered the Frozen Iced mango as our drinks and it was not as good as it used to be.  A little on the diluted side and had huge chunks of ice that will not go through the straw.  Then we went ahead and ordered the Ahí Carpacio, Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip, Portobello, Avocado & Zucchini Fries & Side Fruit Cup.  When our Ahí Carpacio arrived I can tell by color that it was not good.  It has a pale pinkish color when it should be bright red when it's fresh, the smell was also on the inedible side and thought I should try.. well my suspicion was right, the Ahí was disgusting. It had a fishy taste, oxidation already happen on the fish. It was horrible, left a weird taste in my palate.  The warm crab dip was also not at its best; it was a little on the dry side when it should be moist, and it had an old dip that has been re heated a couple of times taste; however, the toast was good. The Zucchini, Avocado & Portobello Fries was about the only thing good that we ordered, because let me tell you about our fruit cups.. it was horrible!! The mixed old cut up Fruits from a couple of days ago with some new cut up fruits. You can tell by the green apple in it, some has a brown edge on the skin and some apple was bright green. Some of the pineapple was also mushy yet some was fresh.  Did you think by adding new cut up fruits customer will not noticed that it is not fresh.  I mean come on!! That got me so angry as a paying customer especially at a great place like The Cheesecake Factory.  I'm not sure who you have working back in the cold food area but he or she needs some training.  First it was the Ahí Tuna, then the fruits! If you doubt the freshness of an item DO NOT serve it to the customer!! It baffled my mind that you would treat customers this way.  When serving customer fish, especially when it is not fresh it can cause food allergies even food poisoning!! Get it together Cheesecake Factory!! Stop messing up on the food, and stop serving old food to customers.  I welcome a response or call back from management or even corporate to share my thoughts. I gave 2 stars because of our server Danielle D.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boca-raton?start=40,2.96,3.31,3.31,2.6320000000000006,3.17
152,Paul D.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,19,,1.0,2016-12-18,You can see from my review history a restaurant or other biz really needs to fail bad to motivate me to write negatively (see City Mattress and Boca Ale House).  Our server Tyler is exonerated because he did a great job and the issues are not his fault.  The two major complaints are how far the food has gone down hill and the seating with tables and chairs  basically on top of each other.  First the bad chow- the grande burrito is not so grande anymore as only 2/3 of the burrito wrap had filling and both ends were empty.  There was maybe a spec of chicken and the cilantro rice wasn't cooked so it was teeth breaking hard.  The shrunken portion/poorly cooked theme held true for the whole table with a couple other low lights being brown guacamole and bone dry chicken tenders.  I didn't expect much from the Cheesecake Factory in the first place but they really went out of their way to under impress.  As far as the communal seating I am not into invasion of personal space and was creeped out the whole meal by the strangers within inches of my family.   Just like the Ale House it used to be great and then the corners get cut...a shame.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boca-raton?start=120,2.96,3.3,3.3,2.5320000000000005,3.164

This particular location is a stone's throw distance from the Grand lux in Boca which is there sister restaurant. The food at cheesecake is pretty good but the cheesecake slices of different varieties is what sets this chain apart. They have 2 full menu pages of different kinds of Cheesecakes which I am still working my way through. If you are a chocoholic I would recommend going to Cheesecake on a regular basis because they have all kinds of Chocolate flavored cheesecakes. Getting back to the food, Cheesecake has a menu the size of a story book so you can pretty much imagine a dish and chances are they will have it on the menu. And every entree is usually to much to begin with so if you want to keep a spot for desserts I would recommend getting one of the small plates. My personal favorite at cheesecake is the four cheese pasta but the fish tacos are equally good.

There were not many guests there as we arrived, but as we sat, more guests filled the room. Our server didn't even tell us her name, but she was an older lady with a long blonde pony tail and glasses. She seemed to grow more and more overwhelmed. We were very patient and not in any hurry since this was our once a week date night. We got our drinks and appetizers in a timely fashion. She took a few minutes to return to take our main course order as she helped several other tables. We decided to start with a few appetizers. Before the appetizers arrived she finally took our order. We loved our appetizers but we didn't finish all of them since we were anticipating our NY strip steak and orange peel chicken entrees. She politely boxed up our appetizers and went about her business. About thirty minutes goes by before she returns to the table to explain the kitchen dropped our meals and then they had to recook the items. She did offer soup or salad while we waited, but once again we wanted to save room for our main course, declining. Another 15-20 minutes goes by before our food finally arrived to the table. Meanwhile, all the tables and guests around us had eaten their dinners, paid their bill, and left. The chicken arrived first and then the steak. The steak was ordered medium and came out almost well done. While my significant other grew very frustrated and had to leave the table, I tasted my orange peel chicken, which I always order. I love my orange peel chicken. It is always moist and juicy, but not today. It was warm at best and the rice was over cooked. As we explained to the server our food was not what we ordered, she claimed that she would go speak to the manager. When the manager arrived, I explained our situation. His response was offering a piece of cheesecake for dessert. We didn't eat our entrees, so dessert wasn't an option. As we requested our bill to leave, he explained he would take care of everything, in exception to the one margarita. We just wanted to pay for our one drink and go home. We left behind our boxed appetizers that had been sitting at the table for almost an hour. Needless to say, we left the Cheesecake Factory very hungry and disappointed.

I go here very often but this time I had a TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. i went to cheesecake and accompanied by two co workers. Our waiter was ""Cody S.""  First, the waiter took around 20 minutes to come take our order. When bringing water, he put the dirty try on the table and yelled over to the bus boy to get us some bread.   When the food arrived, he tried filling up our water cups and spilt water all over the table. At the end, he came with our checks, mine being $17.07 and my co workers being the same price. I gave him a $50 and my coworker gave him a $20. The waiter asked ""how much change do you want?"" When my coworker said ""all of it?"" The waiter asked,""you want the rest of the change?"" When he came back with the change he was short $10, luckily I counted.   This experience was horrible. When I brought it up to one of the managers, Fariq? He was understanding and apologized. But, you would think he would offer some Reconciliation for the bad experience. This has caused us a delay and an awkward experience due to Cheesecakes poor  customer service.

I remember being in school and everyone would be having their birthday dinners there. This location has been around for a while and growing up I've heard good things and bad things. I've heard ""cockroach in my food"" once and I've heard the ""love the food, hate the service""   The food is definitely where it's at with this place in my opinion. They have a HUGE menu with a variety of things! It's almost too hard to choose! I've also never seen such a huge dessert menu too! All different crazy kinds of cheesecakes. I've only been to the Cheesecake Factory about 2 or 3 times. This last Wednesday was my best experience. Our server was super cool and he was attentive for the most part. They must have a lot of side work, or more work to do or something because every time I come to the Cheesecake Factory there's always a holdup. Whether its the server not being attentive or the order being wrong, there's always something. This time it was the kids menu, they took forever to give us a kids menu. It wasn't super busy but definitely steady. We had to ask about 3 times before actually getting a kids menu so everyone could put their orders in. The place has stepped up. It's a lot cleaner and the food got better. The service still needs a little work, until then the food is worth the slow service.  So far, my favorite dish has been the herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The Godiva triple chocolate cheesecake is amazing!!  I want to go back just for the cheesecake!

Always better the next day! However this time I tried the tuna tartar as a appetizer- I've had a similar dish at yard house with their poke nachos. But I must say I favor yard houses more. The tuna was a bit pale. And I would of preferred more chips with the meal. It has a great taste though and I would still recommend it! I also tried the half lemon pepper chicken.

The food was ok but more mediocre than I've had at other Cheesecake Factories. I ordered two apps, the truffle bacon grilled cheese sticks, and the tuna tartare. The grilled cheese sticks sounded better and more exotic than they actually tasted, and by the time they got out to me, they were lukewarm and all that melty cheese had started solidifying (which I don't like, texturally speaking), so I didn't enjoy that very much. The tuna tartare tasted amazing, with a soy ginger sauce, avocado, picked ginger, and sesame seeds - but what I didn't care for was that the tuna was like minced or something, almost like ground meat. It tasted good, but the texture was weird eating it like that - I'm used to ahi tuna being served sliced, so I just thought that was a weird culinary choice. I also ordered their new coffee and cream cheesecake - again, sounded amazing on the menu but just tasted very average and not all it was hyped up to be. It's cheesecake, so of course it was still good to me - just nothing special. Besides the just-ok food, the service was what was really lackluster. Granted, the nearby FAU graduation ceremonies had just finished, so I know they were pretty packed and busy. But they were also aware that this event was happening (based on me calling the night before for a reservation and the hostess mentioning it!), and imo should have staffed themselves properly to accommodate that volume. Because what resulted was us having a waiter who seemed like they could barely be bothered with our table - on the rare occasions we were able to get his attention to help us, his demeanor and communications with us felt extremely rushed and borderline annoyed. It was uncomfortable to say the least, and upsetting to be more accurate!

The fried mac and cheese is to die for. Large menu both for food and drinks, every drink I've had (usually go for fruity cocktails or margs) has been tasty and everything is generously portioned.  There is almost always the same hostess there whenever I've gone, and I'm almost always put off by lack of friendliness. I've come in sometimes and said ""hi how are you?"" And got a gruff ""how many?"" In return- not even a hello. I worked as a hostess for years when I was younger in nearby restaurants and friendliness is the most basic tenet of the job- lack thereof here has made me feel unwelcome before I even sat down.  Aside from the hostess, service is usually what I would consider average- always friendly but lacking in some technical aspects of service. Always have to ask for new silverware in between courses after old has been taken away, before that waiting 5-10 minutes before even being greeted once sat & drinks are slow to come out after that, and despite having extra staff who appear to be bussers somehow dirty plates aren't taken away unless we ask them to specifically. This has been the case almost every time I've eaten here, so I think it's just something that the restaurant should teach its staff. I work as a server at another constantly busy nearby restaurant so it's hard not to notice these things, but I come out to eat to relax so ultimately I still enjoy my experience every time I come here even if service could improve.

The waitress was very attentive. Also the restaurant and the restrooms were very clean. The cheesecakes are to die for with so many different varieties you're sure to find one you like.

Last night was no different. our waiter was great, food came out quickly, and the cheesecake was delicious as usual. When we entered the restaurant we waited at the host stand for a few minutes, i think that there was only 1 hostess working. we walked over to look at the cheesecakes while we waited for her to return. when she finally got back she seemed too preoccupied flirting with a coworker to realize that we had walked up to the host stand. she made eye contact with me a couple times before breaking conversation with him to ask me how many we were going to be. we finally sat and were promptly greeted by our server. we were hungry so we put in for appetizers right away and he brought back over a basket of bread within 1 minute. he answered all of our questions and made really great suggestions. unfortunately they took the beef dip sandwich that my boyfriend LOVES off of the menu, but our server was quick to offer other suggestions and seemed very knowledgeable about each menu item. The food was full of flavor as usual. we started with the chicken taquitos which are served with a salsa verde sauce. we also had the fried macaroni and cheese, which are 4 balls of mac and cheese served over some type of red sauce. both appetizers were delicious! for our meals, i got the shrimp and sausage pasta and my boyfriend had the meatloaf. both meals were very filling and tasted great. my rigatoni seemed very slightly undercooked but it was still very delicious and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. the meatloaf was served with mashed potatoes with gravy and succotash which my boyfriend said was all really great together. we finished up our meal with the banana cream cheesecake, it was served with mounds of whip cream and fresh banana! it was a great final touch.  overall we love the food here  and the service is almost always above par. although it is a chain corporate restaurant, we sometimes choose to eat here over some other local stops.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boca-raton,3.24,3.17,3.17,,3.198
45,Layton M.,"Delray Beach, FL",150,78,219.0,3.0,2017-10-19,Cheesecake Factory what can I say.  Never really have a bad experience here just never really have a great experience unless I'm willing to eat the current date in calories and sodium.  Super large menu and variety and the food is always decent.  A little pricey for the product though. I definitely feel if swaying in the direction of olive garden and becoming less of a nice place to go out to eat.  I usually get the meatloaf but all of the more popular items on the menu are pretty good albeit a little salty.  Cheesecake has always been my highlight here though and can say with confidence that the banana cream is outstanding!   Service is always great here and food always comes out quick.  Not a bad place to eat but the area you're in vs price you're gonna pay there's definitely a couple better options out there for you.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boca-raton,3.32,3.17,3.17,,3.23

It took 40 minutes for all of our food to arrive. And my food when it arrived was cold. I ordered Hibachi steak (i usually get it medium) but Audrey (waitress) said medium is pink here. So she suggested medium well, to only have a little pink. Well, it basically was inedible. But by the time it arrived, I was starving (they did give me a salad on them but it was just unacceptable). Two other people at the table ordered pasta napoletana and did not like it at all. The crispy pineapple chicken was ok and the kids pasta was fine (I mean what can you do to kids pasta...).

As far as the food goes I have tried many dishes over the years but I think my favorite thing to get here is still just trying out all their salads.  All the dinners are huge portions so I feel icky when I get one and finish eating so at least if i get a salad I can overeat and not feel like a pig since it's just a salad. And the salads are always really good. We also used to get take out from here about 2 or 3 times every week but then the serving sizes got smaller.

Avocado was fresh, and there was plenty of chicken. They put the right amount of dressing on. Not too much, and not too little.

The waiter said not a word about it; he just grabbed the dirty ones and replaced them, as if he was saying, ""Don't look at me. Direct your complaints to the dishwasher!"" You'll need to wear a sweater or jacket, because most nights, it's freezing, and people at neighboring tables start conversations with one another about how cold it is. Everyone complained, but it was still cold when I left. I ordered a cold drink when I sat down, but after a few minutes, I realized I would have been better off asking for a blanket and some hot cocoa.

41,Sam P.,"Montreal, Canada",66,57,22.0,2.0,2017-12-23,"I was disappointed with my last experience at this restaurant. I came in a group of 8 and was excited for my usual order of spicy chicken chipotle pasta. It was a huge portion and was piping hot. I love it! Other people ordered the shepherd's pie, the spicy crispy chicken burger, pizza and the chicken mango and avocado salad. All of them were quite satisfied with our meals.  We had one big problem with one of the meals and with the manager, Wyatt. My aunt ordered a burger and when it came out, it was cold and she found it to be very small. When she asked the waiter, he acknowledged that it was abnormally small. The manager came over and was very condescending but eventually said they would make her another burger that would come right away. 40 minutes later, we were all done our meals and the burger was nowhere to be found. Finally, when it did come, it was completely raw. The manager again took no responsibility and corrected my aunt when she asked why it took 40 minutes by saying ""actually it's been 33"". Eventually, they did end up offering her a free meal to go. It was just unfortunate that she couldn't enjoy her meal with everyone.  Overall, I think the restaurant is a good option for families and it offers a variety of different options, all of which are quite good. Our waiter was friendly and the cheesecake is delish! If it weren't for the negative experience with the management, I would probably give a 4 star review.

50,Silas D.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,2,1.0,1.0,2018-01-03,"*MUST READ* For many reasons, this is my review of the worst dinning experience of my life. My girlfriend and I decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory for a nice date. We chose the Cheesecake Factory due to its reputation as a high end quality restaurant; this experience was anything but that. After being seated in the far end of the restaurant, we ordered our wine and water. It didn't take long my girlfriend to realize the wine she ordered was not the right one. No matter. We can overlook it. When the food finally arrived, and it being the holiday we could understand the wait, the food was cold, uncooked and seemed worse than microwaved food. It was the most underwhelming Fettucini Alfredo and Chicken enchiladas I have ever seen. The beans were cold and the rice wasn't cooked. Her Alfredo was soft and cold. UNBELIEVABLE. We asked for a manager and told him we couldn't finish the food. He told us he would take it off and for that I thanked him. It was only after I turned around I saw a massive pile of leftover food and used dishes only inches away from my head that I had determined this was the worst experience ever. After the manager was called again, he was extremely rude by talking over me and treating me like the food they had served me, trash. In the car ride home, my girlfriend said to me, ""at least we know never to go to the Cheesecake Factory again"". This is the type of review and experience you create when you don't take the customers feedback seriously. My girlfriend works for Starbucks and I work for a progressive tech company. We both know how customer service works and what kind of an experience  a customer is deserved. After all, the customer chose you!  *the picture is dishes behind my head, and more were added!*",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boca-raton,3.32,3.09,3.09,,3.182
