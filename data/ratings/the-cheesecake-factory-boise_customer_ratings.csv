Both the chicken dishes we had were tasty and hot. As most people know, the serving sizes at Cheesecake Factory are really large so we had plenty to take home.

The food was also presented so nicely on the plate. I felt the place was so pretty, too. I'm sure you can tell I was happy with my whole dining experience.  What a treat.

Call again and spoke to a male manager, and he was AWESOME. Gave me the person to contact.  What makes me maddest?

The Salmon is one of my favorite dishes - I'm not a big fan of ordering fish that I haven't cooked myself, but it's very well cooked (I usually order the barbeque salmon). The only thing that keeps this from being a perfect 5 stars is the price of the wine. Really, you can easily spend about $30 a bottle, so keep your eye out on that. Also, they can't seem to keep managers for some reason (although it doesn't really seem to affect the overall feeling of the place).

70,Phillip D.,"Meridian, ID",40,83,,4.0,2014-05-07,"I dont go here very often anymore. Its not that its not a good place, because it is. They just took my favorite dish of the menu. My wife loves it here and I know why. The decorations are nice, its clean and the servers that I have run into are super friendly. One thing that I love (I cant recall if its this one or not that does it) are servers that knell down to table level to take your order. I love this. I have only seen 1 restaurant do it. I think it makes servers seem more friendly.  There are a lot of places out there that are not clean, the wait staff are not user friendly, and the food is bad. When you find one that wins in all these categories, it makes me want to mark it as a keeper. The only reason I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is because they took Carmel Chicken off the menu.  Carmel Chicken was like an upscale General Tso's Chicken. A really bad name for a really excellent dish. Speaking of the menu here, its huge. Its one of the biggest menus I have ever seen. How they pull off keeping so much food on hand and having cook staff able to cook each one so well, I have no clue. I am not a fan of Restaurant chains. But in the case of this place, I cant find any faults with them. I an not much of a drinker, but I do like an occasional cocktail. I have the Pina Colada here and its awesome.  Like another restaurant that I wont mention, this place knows how to make one without using a mix. On my last visit, I had the Mac and Cheese Burger. It might sound odd, but you need to have this. They burger is topped with their fried Mac and cheese balls and some of the sauce. The balls are crunchy and cheesy.  The burger is charbroiled. Its smoky and flavorful. If I was to give one negative, I would say that the cheese sauce over powers the burger a bit. But then again, its cheese! Is there such a thing as too much cheese? The other down side I will give is that its on the pricy side. The bill for the 3 of us (One of which is a 10 year old) was $40. A stretch if you are on a budget. But in my opinion, this place is worth the splurge. And dont even get me started on their cheese cakes.

I believe that may have been the time that the waitress entered our order, but she didn't get it into the system very fast. The burger served to me was completely charred on one side, in 3 pieces hidden under melted cheese. I believe they didn't want to have to start the order over when they knew it was messed up, so they tried to hide it, but even if that wasn't the case, the burger was really nasty tasting.

Been thinking of trying the factory for a while and figured this would be a good a time as any.  Cheesecake Factory gets a bad rap for a number of things, the first thing being the length of their menu. And yeah, it's the first thing I thought of when I heard we were going there, and yes it is very very long, but the staff there embraced it. They themselves referred to their menus as novels. Way to roll with the punches there Cheesecake Factory.  It was surprisingly busy for a Wednesday night. The food was great and the staff was sharp. The portions were perfect and it wasn't as expensive as I thought it would be. Over all, I didn't have a bad time. I actually had a decently pretty good experience.

The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because our server was AMAZING and the Lemoncello cake was really good. But the food was terrible, and so was the seating. I never realized how important it is to be comfortable when you eat until I came here. We were seated in the corner booth closest to the hostess area. Now when I think of a booth I think of comfy, lush seating. NO. It was harder than sitting on the ground. It hurt!!! I had to sit on my sweater in order to stay because my butt AND my back were KILLING me within the first 10 minutes. And I'm only 25 years old, so I cant imagine older folks trying to settle in and have a good meal here.  Our server was incredible. He was very attentive and tried his best to help answer our questions about their ridiculously HUGE menu....there are more than 12 pages...and most of them are advertisements...Yup. That's what I want while I'm eating, to look at advertisements for other places in town. What is this, Las Vegas!? No. It's Idaho.  First we ordered the Crispy Crab wontons as an appetizer. I should have assumed that a restaurant that had everything from Chinese to Mexican would be a jack of all trades and a king of none... The wontons themselves were flavorless and chunky. Not what I look for when I'm eating a cream cheese and crab wonton. The dough was cooked too long so it had a slightly burnt taste too it and it was way too thick to begin with. The sauce was really runny and was not sweet and sour but more of a soy sauce and sweet...not tasty.  For dinner I ordered the Pasta Carbonara and a side salad with ranch. My salad came out with the ""wontons"" and the salad was wet. They had pre-dressed the salad too so all the dressing was runny and the leafs were all soggy...all I kept thinking was ""I'm spending $6 on a salad that I could have made for 25cents at home..and it would be tastier.""....sad thoughts.  Next....the Carbonara...sigh. What a disappointment. The sauce was like water. I know why they give you a spoon...it's so you can pick up the milky watery sauce from the bottom of the bowl and spoon it over the pasta...yum...*sarcasm*. The pasta was cooked well but there was no flavor but fat coming through to me. It just tasted horrendous.  My friend ordered the Garlic Noodles upon recommendation from our server. YUCK. I was so grossed out by the flavor profile of this. It was like eating the remnants of an old gym sock. Oh and also - if no one tells you, when you order chicken on your pasta, there will be bones. No one told us this. We had some fun with that. :/ Again, like I said, our server was great and the cake we ate was delicious. I will go back for dessert, and nothing else. And it will be to-go because the seating there is horrendous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boise?start=40,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.9840000000000004,2.8

When it came it was just fine. The manager made a point of checking on me after I ate to make sure all had worked out.

One of the times, I went in and just wanted a light lunch, so I sat at the bar. The bartender watched me come in and sit down but was talking with someone who was apparently a friend. I waited for ten minutes as she passed by me not really doing anything but chatting. Finally I tried getting her attention by saying ""excuse me"", but it took me three times to get her to finally acknowledge me. Then I ordered a salad and a margarita. As I ordered, she rudely AND INCORRECTLY 'corrected' my pronounciation of the name of the salad. When my food came, the salad was a little bland (it had very few of toppings described on the menu. The margarita glass had so much ice packed into it that there was hardly anything in there and the whole drink was watered down and covered in condensation.  She also used table salt for the rim. Srsly, you'd think Cheesecake Factory could spring for something better..  The bartender didn't even wait for me to ask for my bill. She just threw the bill on the counter in a cup. Yes, inside of an empty glass, I kid you not. When I paid cash,  she didn't pick it up and return my receipt . Essentially, I needed to leave and couldn't even get my change, despite asking for it; which forced me to overtip against my will. I'm pretty sure that's stealing.  Then, when I was leaving, I went to the cheesecake counter and had a similarly crappy experience. I waited in line to order a piece to go. When I got to the counter, the lady acted impatient and rude. I ordered something out of the glass case and she rung up my order before informing me that I would have to wait for several minutes before they could open up a glass case, put a piece of cheesecake on there, and then hand it to me. Are you kidding me??!?? Instead, she chose to stand around and tidy up, chat with her co-workers and waste my time. Seriously?!?! What the heck?!?! I've never regretted eating out more!

55,Belinda B.,"Meridian, ID",0,13,3.0,2.0,2017-02-08,"We've been there several times since this location opened. We went last night at about 5 p.m. It wasn't busy at all and we ordered quickly, but ordered items that weren't our normal choices. My husband order fish tacos and I ordered the Shrimp Louie. It was strange when the meal came and my husband was given the fish and chips and I got a salad with 6 medium size shrimp down the center. Obviously my husband's order was just plain wrong, but mine was extremely disappointing. I've never had a Shrimp Louie with a few shrimp on top - generally it is a large portion of small, sweet bay shrimp, something for every bite of your salad. To say I was disappointed would be a major disappointment. When we finally caught the waitress to say that not only had my husband order fish tacos, but the fish and chips arrived with only catsup, no tartar sauce, she looked at us like we didn't know what he ordered. I know that is what he requested because it's not an item he usually chooses and I was a little surprised to hear it. But rather than apologize for a mistake, she acted like we had hurt her feelings even though he told her that he would eat the fish and chips. He could have requested that she correct the situation, but he chose to let it slide. We actually felt like had this been our first visit, we would have felt that we wasted $40+ for a really lousy meal. We've been there plenty of times before, but this could slow our rate of return visits really substantially.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boise?start=40,3.08,3.37,3.37,,3.254

17,Mary A.,"Boise, ID",10,209,,5.0,2017-06-11,"The Cheesecake Factory has been at the Boise Towne Square Mall for almost ten years now.  My first experience was such that I didn't want to go back there.  The portions were huge although tasty and it just appeared that mega amounts of food and dessert was the idea here. We've been here recently for lunch and ordered from the Skinnylicious menu tasting wonderful salads and flatbreads with a smaller calorie output.  Today we opted for brunch which is only served on Sundays here.  Normally this restaurant opens at 11 AM but on Sundays opening time is 10 AM.  Compared to other popular and crowded breakfast places around here this one was fairly quiet and we didn't have to wait! Coffee was robust and fresh.  The orange juice was freshly squeezed.   We ordered.   My husband and I shared a Spinach, bacon, mushroom and cheese omelet and an order of lemon ricotta pancakes.  Our son opted for a Chorizo and Avocado omelet.   Egg orders come with sides of fried potatoes and a choice of bread. The omelets were nice and fluffy and we all enjoyed the combinations we ordered.   The lemon ricotta pancakes were thin, almost crepe like  and came with a small carafe of heated maple syrup.  There was a sprinkling of powdered sugar on the plate and sliced strawberries.  I used about a tablespoon of syrup and honestly wouldn't have needed any since the pancakes on their own were very light, with a touch of lemon and perfectly delicious! When we finished, the server asked if we'd like to see a dessert menu.   It was out of the question---we were full!  I'm thinking that the Cheesecake Factory should change it's name.   There are definitely so many choices on the menu and healthy ones.   There are even calorie counts listed after the items.  Very helpful to those of us wanting to keep the carbs, fats, and calories under control.   And if you really want a special treat after that----there is always cheesecake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boise,2.96,3.29,3.29,,3.158

It was lunchtime but kind of late and in the middle of the week so it wasn't too busy. We were able to get a table within about 5 minutes. Our party arrived in waves which I think benefited us and the wait staff and kitchen because we all ordered as we arrived and none of us had to wait for our food for a long time.  Myself and my mother-in-law have to eat a modified diet and were able to find entrees that worked with our needs. Our waiter was very attentive and great with all of us.

I usually avoid big chains but I have come to really appreciate the Cheesecake Factory. They have an extensive menu, the food is prepared well, is tasty, served promptly, and is hot. The service is excellent -- they must train their staff extremely well. And the prices are totally reasonable. If anything the weakest part of the meal was the Cheesecake itself. But, as a chain they continue to impress me -- well at least this one place does, I have not been to others. I totally recommend this Cheesecake Factory! [BTW -- as was recently in the press, and the subject of lawsuits, we also experienced the inflated tip suggestions on our bill. We split the bill 50/50 across two credit cards but the suggested tips on the bill were based on the whole amount. Luckily we noticed it at the time and didn't make the mistake of overtipping.

They have lots of very good food, too, but the cheesecake come in so many flavors, and large sizes that I find myself going out to dinner elsewhere and stopping by here for dessert.  My mom got a side of strawberries for her cheesecake and gave them to me. To be completely honest, they were the biggest, best tasting strawberries ever. I felt like I never had a real strawberry until I had one from CF. I think they fly them in super fresh or something.  There is sure to be a flavor that everyone will love.  The seating isn't the best and you're super close to other people, but it is what it is.

Cheesecake wise, go for the white chocolate raspberry. It's so good, it's delicious but not too rich. You can actually enjoy it. Great food, wonderful ambiance.

Yes, the menu is extensive.  I wish it was like a 1/3 of the size it is, but I end up sticking with what I know & don't venture out to try something new.  My husband and I had Hunter as our server for the last 2 visits. I have to admit that service in the past has been pretty hit or miss....with more misses than hits. However, once we had Hunter, my faith was restored! He is always totally attentive without being annoying, he is super friendly, and he even managed to remember exactly how I wanted my cheesecake. I hadn't been here for about a month and my cheesecake order is a bit of a pain in the ass...strawberries on the side, glaze on the side, whipped cream on the side, & I want the original cheesecake with the sour cream topping, not the standard cheesecake that is served with the strawberry cheesecake. Yes, I have food issues. Yes, I know I am a pain...but I do tip well!  He has only been our server once before tonight, but remembered everything about my order. Impressive.  For dinner tonight we ordered: Chicken Parmesan Pizza Style Old Fashioned Cheeseburger & fries The Chicken parm is seriously AH-MAZING!! Seriously! It's balanced perfectly and the chicken maintains its crispness without tasting over fried or breaded The burger was also on point.  It's always seasoned really well and doesn't require a ton of sauce to make up for the lack of flavor.  The only negative is how crowded it gets and when it's crowded (most nights) you are seated super close to other diners. It doesn't allow for much privacy, but hey, I'm willing to endure it when the reward at the end of the night is cheesecake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boise,3.6,3.34,3.34,,3.4440000000000004

As a server it pains me to watch this. It literally would've taken two seconds for one of them to deliver it to us and help their fellow server out.

Even though I almost always order the same item, it's always delicious.  Regardless of what you order, your meal always starts with their delicious, fresh baked sourdough and black bread; served warm with creamy butter.  My favorite menu item is their Asian chicken lettuce wrap tacos.  The wraps are served in leaves of tender Bibb lettuce, filled with grilled, moist chicken, fresh bean sprouts, shredded carrots, and other Asian components.  My favorite part is the two sauces you drizzle over the top, one a sweet cilantro sauce, the other a sweet soy sauce based sauce.  The sauces are addicting.  Nicely flavored and a perfect addition to the taco toppings. It's ordered off the light meals section and with the bread is just the right amount of food without feeling too guilty.  Today I splurged and tried their buffalo chicken nuggets.  The nuggets are made in house with a nice crispy batter coating, juicy chicken inside, and a schmear of buffalo hot sauce on top.  Some come skewered on a toothpick with a dill pickle slices, which adds a nice briny contrast, and ranch dressing is served on the side for dipping.  Not only are they delicious, but also a very good value at only $5 for 6 large nuggets, good for sharing as a starter.  Our server was good and offered not only the daily specials but recommendations.  Our food came out quickly, and our drinks were re-filled a couple times, would have appreciated a refill after we finished eating and were still talking, but still good service otherwise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boise?start=20,3.72,3.35,3.35,,3.498
