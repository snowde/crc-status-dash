The staff seemed nice and are pretty attentive considering it was kinda busy. I went there a few times I can say nothing really stands out for me as far as the food was concerned. This last time had to be the worse. We got Shepard's pie.. yuk. It was like a mushroom and pea beef stew with a lump of mash potatoes on top. Honestly it didn't look good but we tried to eat it anyways.. It tasted like it looked.. greasy. We also ordered fish tacos they fell apart upon arrival and neither of us could enjoy those either. The small plates and apps were awesome, chicken croquettes, stuffed mushrooms and onion rings, we reordered some to replace the dinner. The waiter ask if we wanted things wrapped up since the plates were full NO way we replied. He must have told the manager because he came over to hear our complaints and refunded for the two bad meals. We got two pieces of cake to go they were great. and because they at lease tried to fix the issue I am gonna change it to three stars for the recovery ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=460,3.04,3.28,3.28,2.54,3.1840000000000006

252,Chris C.,"South End, Boston, MA",138,119,,3.0,2012-02-24,"Fat G. counting the hours till the end of this workweek. And so, we come to a review of a place that most people have seen before, not necessarily been to. The Cheesecake Factory is located in the Copley Mall, near Barnes and Nobles. Come inside, and there's a waiting area as well as a place to order desserts for take-out. There are a lot of tables, a small bar, and seating in the back, which has windows allowing you to see out into the street. Ambiance is tough to describe - it's not candlelight, but it's dim. A friend of mine said that when he hears Cheesecake Factory, he thinks pasta. Aside from cheesecake, I'm not really sure what to get this time. Having remembered being here before for a party, I opted to order a pizza instead of getting one of their pasta dishes (it comes on one of those big plates, but only 1/2 of it is actually food.) They have a wine menu, and a good variety on the menu, ranging from sandwiches, pastas, soups, salads, desserts, pizzas, seafood, etc.  The Everything Pizza had its fair share of cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, sausage and onions. Though I was a bit disappointed, because the slices felt firm on the top half, but kinda wet and soft on the bottom half. Think a trapezoid of decent pizza, and a small triangle of sadness. The pizza was about $13, which i guess is ok. The waiter looked sad when everyone ordered water, and didn't want dessert... It's an alright place, but not a place I'd frequent regularly. You really come here for the  romantic atmosphere and the cheesecake, but that's really it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=240,3.08,3.29,3.29,2.444,3.206
442,Klaudia K.,"Boston, MA",0,1,,2.0,2012-02-26,"While the food at the Back Bay Cheesecake Factory lives up to the name of the restaurant chain, the service is appalling. The wait took an hour and a half and came with much confusion regarding the seating arrangement (we were a party of 11.) The waitress was not only rude but also sarcastic towards the people in our party. She made the atmosphere unwelcoming and made everyone feel rushed. The belligerence was greatly unappreciated. Overall, I would not recommend anyone going to this Back Bay Cheesecake Factory unless they would be willing to put up with the egotism and ignorance of a cantankerous waitress named Jessica K.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=440,3.12,3.26,3.26,2.3440000000000003,3.2040000000000006

The first time I came, I ordered the petite fillet, and unlike other places my steak wasn't burnt for once. It was delicious. My boyfriend ordered the fetucinni alfredo and he loved it.. We also ordered crispy crab bites for an opening. It was good, but I think six gum ball sized pieces were served. The waiter was extreme friendly. Second time, we ordered same thing but with the avocado rolls or whatever as an opening. My steak was burnt and the avocado rolls had no taste. The waiter wasn't so friendly either. Then third time, I came with a group of friends for a friends birthday. Two people ordered pasta from the lunch since we came during lunch time but the waiter gave us a dinner plate. We didnt know so when the bill came we had to pay for more than we originally ordered. The waiter should have asked us if we wanted the dinner or lunch serving.

296,Anthony C.,"Boston, MA",0,14,,1.0,2012-03-28,"I come to this location quiet often and I'm always pleased with the food and service.  However, this past Sunday we had a terrible experience.  The waiter was very personable and checked in with us often but I just don't think he listened to anything we said.  I have a very serious food allergy and told him what I was allergic to and if he could check with the chef to make sure everything was okay.  (A few restaurants in Boston are really good with allergies and have a manager or even chef come over to go over what your having and ensure that everything is safe).  We placed our order, we got Buffalo Blasts for our appetizer and it was really good.  For our Main course, my gf got a Teriyaki entrée and I got a bacon cheeseburger and fries.  I'm allergic to sesame seeds and when our food came my burger had a sesame seed bun..  People make mistakes, I get it.. the slip might not have said it or maybe they forgot, but you think the waiter would have noticed..  Anyway, I let him know how serious the allergy was an if I could get another one without the sesame roll.  He took it away and about 10 minutes later a manager came over and apologized.  The burger came back over, it was lettuce and a slab of meat and cheese on the plate.. Where are my fries, my bacon and my bun.  Are you telling me you don't have plain rolls?  He forgot and brought over a plain  roll and said 'oh the fries, yea they umm contain your allergy'.. I've ate here a million times, no they don't.. They need to take allergy's at the Cheesecake factory much more serious. When we got the bill they didn't comp the burger, they did add it twice and then take one away, which I thought was kind of messed up..  When we got home we noticed that our takeout back was covered in teriyaki sauce because they didn't fasten the lid.  Just an overall bad experience.  Basically we paid $60 bucks for an Amstel light and a tea. I'm not one to jump on to Yelp just to write a bad article, but it's been bothering me that I didn't complain and still left a decent tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=280,2.84,3.22,3.22,2.308,3.0680000000000005

All I wanted was just a large garden salad, without crutons/cheese- I knew my options were limited because I am vegan and have a gluten allergy. The first time i went there I asked if the balsamic dressing was vegan- I was told by wait staff that it was and trusted them as I thought they knew what they were talking about. The next time I went I asked about the dressing again, which were gluten free and vegan. They have no gluten free/vegan dressings- how could that even be with that large of a menu? Come to find out the waiter told me the balsamic dressing has honey in it- the waiter from the previous time told me it did not. It would be helpful for people with food allergies to have a seperate menu like other chain resturants do- bertuccis, not your average joes, burtons- these all have way smaller menus but offer way more information at the location for everyone's knowledge instead of having to rely on the staff.

174,Danielle B.,"Boston, MA",18,10,1.0,4.0,2012-06-02,"If you have friends or relatives visiting the area, this is a great place to take them for great dessert and cool ambiance. This is NOT a good place to go if you are counting calories or if you want attentive service. The location--right there in the Copley Mall area--is fantastic for tourists and visitors. The orange and green lines have subway stops right there. The interior design is dim with a great view outside, if you get a window seat. The booths are hard and uncomfortable but beautiful to look at. There are intriguing Eye-of-Sauron tribal lights on the sides of the booths... needless to say while waiting (and waiting...) for your food, your eyes will have plenty of decorations to look at. It was my birthday and while they did come out and sing to me and have a cute candle in the cheesecake, I would like to have ordered another drink or had a refill, but the waiter was never around. I realize it's a busy place, but they could have made so much more money if they had been attentive! We wanted more of that delicious bread and more cocktails, but the staff was always elsewhere. So hunt down your server and ask for more bread! It is fantabulous! The food itself was great once we finally got it! I LOVE that they have an entire diet menu, even if it has a silly name ""Skinnylicious."" The gripe I have with this is the entire menu says ""590 calories or less."" If you are health conscious enough to order off the diet menu, why don't they give exact calorie counts??? Not all meals have exactly 590 calories. Budgeting what I eat--what if one salad has 300 and the burger has all 590???? I wish they were more specific. Every single slice of cheesecake will be orgasmically good, just don't even bother calorie counting there. The lowest calorie slice is the Splenda with strawberries cheesecake with a hefty 610. (On my 1000 cal/day diet, this is quite a doozy.) Some of them have over 2,000 calories IN A SINGLE SLICE.

249,Julia M.,"Brighton, MA",36,90,19.0,3.0,2012-07-08,"As far as chain restaurants go, The Cheesecake Factory is decent.  Their 10-page plus menu is a tad overwhelming though & makes choosing an entree rather difficult.  Once you decide on what to order & receive the food, you'll likely find that the food is okay -- not terrible but also not great.   I recommend avoiding the pasta dishes, as they tend to be a letdown.  The tomato basil pasta, for instance, is usually too salty.  If you are looking for really good pasta dishes, head on over to the North End. The two redeeming qualities of The Cheesecake Factory are its cheesecakes & location.  Its cheesecakes (at least the ones I've tried) are good, & the restaurant is conveniently located inside the Pru, just steps from the entrance to the Prudential stop on the green line.  Its convenient location, however, can also be a bit of a drawback -- the place gets very crowded Friday & Saturday nights.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=240,2.6,3.18,3.18,2.508,2.9480000000000004

302,Andrew G.,"CHESTNUT HILL, MA",0,26,1.0,4.0,2012-07-27,"Cheesecake Factory has to be one of my favorite ""Go-To"" Places of all time. I've been to them in NJ, MA, VA, MD, and a few other states I'm sure. I have one simple rule when I go to Cheescake Factory (no, its not try to eat an entire cheesecake by myself) its that I will never try something on the menu twice. Just won't do it. There has to be over 200 menu items everyday, so I think its an injustice to limit myself to the same thing. I have never had a dish that I have not liked here The last time I came was for dinner on a Saturday night in March maybe. We were seated within 10 minutes which was a surprise. Its inside the Prudential Center, so there's plenty to do while you wait anwyay, but definitely come early because this place gets PACKED! We started out with chips and guacamole. Now, I am not a guacamole ""snob"" whatsoever (I probably couldn't even tell you the difference between really good and really average guacamole to be honest), but I thought this stuff was pretty good. They came to the table and mashed it up right in front of you and gave us plenty of chips. You can get mild, medium, or spicy, but we opted for mild and I thought it was great. Pretty sure that was less than $10 too which is great.  Today I ordered Stuffed chicken Tortillas and they did not disappoint. As usual the plate was HUGE! Tortillas were fresh and bursting at the seams with chicken, cheese, peppers, onion, and cilantro. It was served with black beans and a sweet corn cake that was awesome! I'm not too familiar with Spanish/Mexican cooking but that corn cake was just so good- a perfect complement to the spiciness of the salsa. Honestly, do not even remember what my friend got because I was so engulfed in my food. In the past I've had Huevos Rancheros for brunch which was delicious (and huge..actually I'm going to stop saying meals are huge because I am pretty sure its implied at this point. You do NOT go to this place on a diet).  I've had Jambalaya Pasta with seafood where the sauce was perfectly made and you could really taste the layering of flavors. I've had the little pizzettes with sausage and ricotta as a ""small plate"" that were awesome. Corn tamales are delicious.  One day after purging myself with fast food, I even ordered a salad at this place (Me...a salad?). To this day, the Factory Chopped Salad is one of my favorite salads ever. Its actually listed as an appaetizer but I couldn't even finish it. Lettuce, avocado, bacon, apples...everything you could want in a salad and more. Do I even need to describe the cheesecake? Heavenly. My favorites so far have been Red Velvet, Oreo Crumble, and Dutch Apple. The truly unfair part is by the time I'm always done eating my dinner, I barely have room to split a slice with somebody! And I'm not talking ""I think I ate too much I better stop here"" full...I'm talking ""I cannot physically open my mouth anymore because there is so much food inside me"" full.  Cheesecake Factory is just good. They serve meals from all kinds of backgrounds in huge portions. Is the most authentic food you'll ever eat? Definitely not. Is it absolutelt delicious food that will keep you coming back when you get the craving? Uh-huh. Oh yea no doubt about it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=300,2.72,3.17,3.17,2.6079999999999997,2.9899999999999998

That all changed when one night our server brought out my girlfriend's food cold. She mentioned that the pasta was cold, so the server said she'd go have them reheat it. Seems easy enough. She brought it back, and we asked her for some more water and some olive oil for the bread. What happened next baffled both of us. She turned to my girlfriend, who is black and had been making the requests, and said: ""Who do you think you are, you n****r b***h?"" Stop the presses. Needless to say we went and complained, and the manager of the restaurant started crying about it. They gave us the meal for free, which we had no intention of finishing, and offered us a variety of gift cards in various amounts, which as nice as it was, felt a lot like trying to buy some quiet out of us, especially as they raised the amounts each time we said no. I don't know what it was that caused our now-fired server to burst like that, as I don't think our requests were unreasonable, but whatever it was, neither of us want to go to a restaurant where servers hurl racial slurs and profanities at you.

Went Sunday during a break from seeing the tattoo convention and got the flakiest, most befuddled service I've ever experienced outside of a Waffle House. Our young, brunette waitress took forever to take our order and then kept promising us bread and not bringing it. When the table that arrived next to us the sat down half an hour after we arrived they got bread and service immediately (from a different, older staff member) while we were still waiting for our entrees to come out.

We had a fairly large party, so we tried to make a reservation, but I guess they don't do that? Since we were there on a Saturday night, we ended up waiting a very long time and splitting our party into several different tables in different sections of the restaurant. Also, this is the most crowded I've ever seen a Cheesecake Factory--ridiculous.  Anyway, our waiter was actually really awesome, patient, and quick, which is why I didn't give them 2 stars. I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, which I have had at several other locations and normally love. Tonight, however, it was super salty and there was a huge sprinkling (more like dumping) of cheese in the middle, which was odd because I've never had cheese in this dish unless I specifically asked for it. Overall, it made it salty and greasy, and unappetizing. The cheesecakes were pretty standard for CF, though, so at least that was comforting. Bottom line?

Their menu is like a book but it's not a good thing, it takes me 20 minutes just to read, and when I'm done I don't even want to order anything. Nothing jumps out. It's almost too much. Not only that, but everything is an enormous portion with thousands of calories - they consistently top lists of least-healthy foods.

Way back when, I used to work in one of these for a couple of months.  The menu is somehow more daunting as a diner than it is as a cook, and that's saying something.  I mean... look at this thing, who designed this menu?  It's like someone actually sat there and asked ""well, what about the people who don't like that"" to every culinary concept that came up and finally the pastry chef just said ""FUCK IT.  Let them have Italian, Chinese, French, American, AND Mexican food, I'm making fucking Cheesecake, bitches!""  I mean, I don't know if that's exactly how it went down, but the only other thing I can think of is that someone ate a bunch of recipes and then barfed them all back onto a menu.

I am on a more strict diet so there are things I wouldn't be able to eat. The menu is huge -- more like a book so it does take a while get through it and check out what you want.  The place, usually around dinner time is very busy with long waits. We didn't wait long, probably about 7 minutes or so. Could have been worse, i suppose. We waited over 30 minutes once and still had to wait another minute or 2 even after our buzzer lit up.  After we placed our drink order, it took awhile to get to us - it was only water. I don't know why it took so long. Maybe they took a while to cut the lemon and lime? The bread came out and they were out of wheat so all we got were white bread which my friend and I both really care for. The waiter apologized and could get us a fresh batch but there might be a few minute wait because they were out of it. We were ok with that.  We didn't order an appetizer but just went straight for our entrees. My friend order her usual and I ordered the Grilled Salmon. It came with Broccoli and Mashed potatoes. I can't eat potatoes so opted for another green side - asparagus.  The bread finally came and we were both starving. That was good. I chose not to put butter and it was still good. (Usually i smother it with butter... mmmm).  Our entrees took a little while. The broccoli looked like they were previously frozen florets. When you bite into it, it wasn't exactly like fresh ones either -- taste just like previously frozen florets. There was no flavor to it, no crispiness, just very limpy. The asparagus was a little bit over looked and limpy as well. I do have to say, the Salmon was done just right. It was a good size piece and was not over cooked. I am however, disappointed in the 6 pieces of asparagus.  We waited for the water to be refilled but that never came. When it did, we were pretty much done with our meals.  Finally, after much wait, the check came. I was in shock they charge an extra $1 for asparagus. I asked the waiter about it. He said the computer automatically charged me it because I substituted a different side. When did this happen??? There was nothing written on the menu that they'd charge you extra for sides. What if you can't eat certain foods?? So obsurb and never heard of. He apologized for it but didn't offer to talk to a manager... so we opted to give less than our usual generous 20% tip because clearly he didn't deserve it.

Some of the staff here take their time to actually talk to their customers and hold small conversations with them. Overall, I really love their staff.  Another nice thing about this restaurant is the design of the place. I love looking around because the lighting is slightly dim and it has a nice feel to it.

The baked beans, probably from a can were OK, so was the guacamole and the sour cream was fresh. The burrito was totally disgusting. It was filled with steamed rice, really old chicken that was reheated multiple times, what was supposed to be caramelized onions were just burned onions, they were actually black, specks of corn probably from a  can and specks of fried pepper which were OK. It felt like you were eating steamed rice and really old, dry and partially burned chicken. The cheese and salsa was on top of the tortilla instead of being inside, or at least the cheese being inside. I don't claim to be a burrito connoisseur but something felt seriously wrong with the burrito setup compared to what I am used to. Some of the salsa tasted like spoiled tomatoes. The whole dish literally swam in some kind of cheese sauce with green stuff in it.

317,Chaundre D.,"East Cambridge, Boston, MA",0,1,,4.0,2013-06-13,"Hey y'all.  Tonight was the first time I went to the Cheesecake Factory-- and let me just say one thing: it was de-vine! Here's why I loved it: 1. They gave me two delicious half-loaves of bread in the beginning of my meal.  2. My waiter was handsome. 3. They piled on the cheese (I got the California Omelet-- I think there were 4 DIFFERENT kinds of cheeses). 4. The ambiance in the room was so fancy, I felt like a duchess. 5. The cheesecake! My only complaints: 1. They only gave me 3 pads of butter for a whole loaf of bread. 2. There was no butter on the toast that came with my omelet. 3. I could not understand my waiter. (But he was extremely handsome...) I would like now to describe what I ate to y'all. Here it goes: California Omelet: This was a cheese-y vegetarian de-light. It was certainly scrumptious. The omelet was fluffy and came with a bunch of fresh vegetables, sour cream, avocado, and 4 cheeses baked inside. I thought that the presentation was real nice, and the taste was de-vine. Then, I had the option of potatoes or tomatos on the side and I chose potatoes. They were a bit crispy; seemed a little over-cooked to me, but the seasonings were good. Over all, though, I've had better potatoes. The toast that came with it was dry and not buttered, so I did not eat it. Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake: This cheesecake was the best I've ever had. That's why I gave this restaurant 4 stars. I didn't think it deserved it until I ate some of the cake! It came with whipped cream and some chocolate sauce on the plate. Each bite was like fireworks in my mouth/throat. I tell you, I haven't felt as good as I did while eating that cheesecake in YEARS. If you are ever in Boston, you should definitely stop in to this one-of-a-kind restaurant, if not just for the cheesecake!

However, we had a server who could have cared less for us.  We waited for ages (guess about 10 minutes)  before we had any service. We finally flagged someone down to take our order. We ordered water, our appetizer and our meal. 5 minutes after that we finally had our actual server come by who was noticeably annoyed that we flagged someone down to get service. So for the rest of our time there we were treated with less than stellar quality that is so typical of the cheesecake factory.

CF is always the default #1 idea when it comes to brainstorming a place to eat for a fairly large group. There's more to Boston you know!!!  As a foodie, I secretly die a little inside every time CF is chosen. I'll let the exchange students wanting to visit CF reason slide, but with the rest of my American friends, there's no reason to visit this place more than once a year. I don't have a thing against chains, it just baffles me when a lot of people don't want to venture beyond CF for a nice dining experience. If I'm in charge of deciding where to eat, CF will not exist in my list. Yes, CF has food that doesn't disappoint, but I wouldn't say it's outstanding. Portions are large and for the most part overpriced. Menu offerings lean towards Italian and Mexican cuisine. I thought it was brilliant when a friend ordered off of the appetizers list because of the smaller yet filling portions. Their skinnylicious side menu is an annoyance. In an ideal world if one dines out, one should enjoy food wholeheartedly without having to give a #(*k about calorie count.  Recent visits, I've had their White Chicken Chili and Kobe Burger. The Chicken Chili is on the hot end similar to that of salsa. It's like a spicy tomato chicken soup with rice. Kobe Burger was decent, done medium rare as requested. Pricing was obvious it wasn't real Japanese Kobe beef, but their pseduo Kobe beef tasted decent. It'd be  foolish to use real Wagyu Kobe beef as burger patties anyways!

All the food - cheesecake and otherwise - is quite good. It's the decor that throws me a little. It's perfect in a way. Warm lighting, soft calm colored walls reminiscent of a cozy little Italian restaurant, and clean. Super clean. So why 3 stars?  It's too perfect. Although it tries to be warm and cozy, it fails to achieve such a feeling. The mix of the super-cleanliness and the high ceilings (All of which are nice), it still gives off a feeling of trying too hard. And it's this feeling that takes away from what otherwise could be a very pleasant atmosphere.  If the feeling and looks of a place don't affect you much, and all you really care about is food, then I'd recommend it.

Around lunch, it's never busy so it's perfect for someone trying to escape their workplace breakroom to grab a quick lunch.

I also ordered the smoked salmon spring rolls which I would suggest not ordering as they were not very impressive.

For dessert I had the classic cheesecake with glazed strawberry. This cake is to die for. Absolutely heavenly. The cheesecake itself isn't dense and heavy, it was surprisingly light in texture and flavour and had the perfect amount of sweetness to it.

I did notice on our way to the table the the floor is very slick and must have grease or something on it. After being seated we began looking through the menu. Our waiter was awkward, but did get our orders right. I would have to note though that I had to ask for a straw three times and we had to ask for refills on drinks everytime. I have eaten at this specific store two prior times though and the waitstaff was much better each time.  The four of us ordered the macoroni and cheese burger with vegetarian patty, chicken and buscuit, BBQ chicken salad and a regular cheeseburger. I sampled a bit of everything and it was all delicious as always. We each got a piece of cheesecake as well and they all did not dissapoint.  Vegetarian options here are pretty decent considering that there is a veggie patty for burgers as well as salads and pastas that can be ordered without the meat(s).  I'm giving this four stars because the food and sweets are very delicious, there is a great selection (almost too big though), the room we were in was near a window and not too crowded or dark, and although the waiter on this occasion wasn't the most pleasant or helpful.

179,C.J. C.,"Buena Park, CA",0,94,,3.0,2014-09-15,"Food is good. Probably their food worths 4-star.  I have eaten here several times over past couple of years, and dishes have been at least OK.  Orange Chicken was not really impressive. I'm a huge fan of Orange Chicken (ordering it at Cheesecake Factory already proves it!) and it was below average orange chicken among the ones I'd tasted, yet was also the most expensive one. However, white cream pasta (forgot exact name), BBQ burger were good.  And Jamaican Shrimp and Chicken (with Curry sauce) was fantastic! I'd recommend this dish to anyone.  However, their service and place maintenance is awful. Perhaps these non-food materials take 1-2 stars off of them. I see some Yelpers giving 1 stars due to their service, and I totally understand them. Floor is so slippery, I felt like somebody spilled oil on the floor or something. Hostesses always underestimate the waiting time. When they say it would be 10 minutes waiting, they call me like 25 minutes later. When they call 20 minutes, I get called after 30+ minutes. Some may have no problem with that business strategy, but I am always irritated by it. When they say 10 minutes, I expect to be seated at least within 15 minutes, not 25+.  I wouldn't say much about waiters. I remember when I visited here with 3 of my college friends, the waiter was really annoying. He was slow, didn't come to take order for like 20 minutes, and didn't refill water. Though, in my recent visit, waitress was so kind, asked for order frequently (yeah we asked for extra minutes to decide what to get like 3 times), and even after placing an order, she came back to us and told us that our dishes are being prepared and would come out in several minutes.  So I guess it just depends on who you get as your server. Overall, my experiences here has been okay. I know I will get good food when I go there, it's all about other factors (price, waiting time, service, maintenance, etc) that changes the dining experience for the night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=220,2.96,2.97,3.092,2.9240000000000004,2.966

90,Isabella C.,"San Francisco, CA",294,170,407.0,4.0,2014-09-18,"4 stars for the cheesecake, 3 stars for the food. Let's be real. I don't think we go to the Cheesecake Factory for the food.  They do have a nice range of options on the menu but I find that nothing tends to stand out very much. I've had most of their pastas and usually they're quite bland. They do have different sauces and taste accordingly, but generally there are no spices or special flavors used to accentuate the natural taste of the vegetables/meats in the dish. The one appetizer I've had that really stands out is the Buffalo Blasts. They're fried balls of Buffalo chicken bits and cheese and they taste heavenly though they're also extremely greasy... My favorite salad is the Luau salad and not surprisingly, it errs on the unhealthier side of salads.  I would definitely recommend sharing main courses and appetizers per table instead of each ordering a main because the serving sizes are very generous. It's important to make sure to save room for cheesecake at the end! And on that note, I'll just say that I think the best part about the Cheesecake Factory is the range of choice you get with cheesecakes. I've made it a personal goal to never repeat a flavor and to be honest, they're all amazing in their own way. The texture of the cheesecake tends to be fairly consistent regardless of flavor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=120,3.0,2.96,3.088,3.12,2.9760000000000004

However, when I needed to change her diaper before we left the restaurant I asked another server where the changing facilities were and what type of facilities they had, he said ""I don't know, I've never been in the ladies room before"". Erm... Not exactly helpful! I wasn't expecting him to have been in there, I just assumed working there he might know something about the facilities?! When I got in the restroom there was just a marble surface in a dark area of the room to change your baby... This was obviously not designed by someone who has children! Needless to say, my daughter was wriggling about and bumping her head on the hard surface (even with the changing pad from the diaper bag) and crying because it was so uncomfortable and cold and dark. I had to abandon my plan to change her there and rush outside, calm her down and change her on the grass!

Before I start my rant on yesterday's 'meh' experience I'd like to clarify - the cheesecake is still BOMB. My boyfriend and I got the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake to take home and share over the next few days. It's seriously rich, but seriously delicious. Now, back to yesterday's experience. When we got there around 6/6:15 there was a short wait. We put our name in for 2 and stayed in front of the host stand. 15 minutes went by and we noticed people were going up to the stand (after we had already been there) and were being called before us. Hmm. My boyfriend went to check on the status of our table and the hostess rudely mentioned she had called his name. Mmmmm. Nope. So we waited a few more minutes until she felt it was appropriate to have someone seat us. Another girl brought us to our table. We went to the right of the host stand, along the wall to the back of the bar area, left into the bar area, and through the bar area back up to the front. In short, we could have turned left at the host stand and saved a minute or two weaving through congestion. Le sigh. Apparently being a host at this place requires having a pulse. A brain? Not necessary. Our server was friendly, quick to bring the beverages and gave us an ample amount of time to review the novel of a menu this place has.  Sidenote: my boyfriend always wants to avoid TCF claiming the menu is too big and they make everything 'fine' but nothing 'well.' In short, it's been a challenge to get him to want to come here with me in our two years of being together. Anywho, I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp. Thank God my boyfriend doesn't read Yelp reviews because it was exactly how he describes food at TCF - 'fine.' The sauce was 'nice' with a good amount of heat, but the dish was covered in toasted coconut that seemed like it would have gone better with a dessert than a savory dish.

It's fresh and flavorful and I highly recommend it. For drinks, I ordered the passion fruit mojito and my friend ordered the pineapple mojito. Both were delicious. For an entree, I ordered the popular chicken Madeira, and I can see why it's so popular! It's delicious but portion sizes are huge so if you're saving room for cheesecake (which, come on, you kinda have to) you might want to box the other half of the portion!

We were shocked when the list of cheesecakes covered two entire pages.  Sadly my first choice of fresh blueberry and white chocolate had sold out, however our waitress recommended that I try the raspberry and white chocolate instead, so I did. The slices were not at all skimpy, so much so that my sugar levels were off the radar after finishing.  The cheesecake itself was moist and light with exceptional flavours running throughout.

Lot of people were having late lunches, or early dinners , I guess. I was here for what seemed to be lunch #2.  Anyhow, I'll just say that right off the bat, that the service we received was pretty terrible. Our waitress was slow, wasn't very friendly, never asked about water refills, or checked up on how we're doing. -1 star for that. As you may all know, this place offers A TON of food. After 15 minutes of looking at the menu, we managed to narrow our order down to: Crab Artichoke Dip, Shepard's Pie, Grilled Salmon, and Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake. Crab Artichoke Dip- served with thin, crispy slices of buttery bread. The dip itself was pretty good; it was thick and creamy, and reminded me of chowder. The only complaint I had was that there wasn't much crab in the dip. Maybe it was blended in or something, but I was expecting chunks of crab meat. Not really worth the $11.50. Sherpard's Pie- This was my first time trying sherpard's pie, but I thought it was tasty! Has meat, peas, mushrooms, carrots covered in a rich sauce and topped with a mound of mashed potatoes. Meat was flavorful and not dry , and the portion was pretty generous, so would give this dish 5 stars. Grilled Salmon- Fish itself was pretty standard, maybe a little above average. But then again, I've never really had a grilled salmon that made me go 'MMMMmm, OH SO DELICIOUS!!!!' It's served with side of tartar sauce and steamed, seasonless broccoli. 3 stars Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake- caramel+pecan layer, followed by cheesecake layer+ chocolate brownie layer. The chocolate thing on top was super good. That's some solid chocolate right there. But the cheesecake itself was ok. Good, but not something I would want to order again. 3 stars Love the menu offerings. Love the portions. Kinda love some of the food. Hate the service. And the prices.

For my entree I got the buffalo blisters, four cheese pasta with shrimp, and a loaded factory burrito. Are all of it in 7.5 minutes. It was so good that I ordered round two of all the entrees.

So today I decided to give it 2nd chance by going to its store in difference location, and here is what happened again: a tiny wood stick was found in my artichoke dip. After a closer look, I found out it is the tip part of a toothpick! which reminds me what happened on 2013 Mother's day:  Huge disappointment, ruined my Mother's day: I am so regret to take my mom there for lunch on Mother's day! First of all, it took us more than 30 minutes wait for our food served. There were not even many people at that time. Both sides of our neighbors' food were ready and they came later than us , we still sat there waiting. All I ordered was burger and my mom had wasabi tuna. It should not take that long. But fine, it's Mother's day. It's not like me and my mom were in a hurry anyway. We wanted to take our time, enjoy the beautiful day. It was not easy to spend some quality time together, and to celebrate the day, when she lives in another continent across the ocean. However, as our lunch towards end, here came the WORST part: I noticed there was a fruit TAG in my mom's plate, mingled with rice! The manager came to explain: they used orange peels for the dish. The tag may fall into the plate accidentally when peeling the orange skin.They could take away the rest of my mom's food, and gave us a piece of free cheese cake as apology. Here I think is the funny part: 1. I don't want to know why/how the fruit tag get into the dish. 2. Sure, they could add orange peel but it doesn't mean it's OK to get into the plate. 3.  All they offered is just taking the plate away, and offering a piece of cake to fix the problem. We paid for the meal, and did not even finished it. My mom meant to box the rest before I found the tag. So in the end, they gave us a newly cooked, equal portion of the left meal, and a piece of cake. My mom is ok with it. But I am totally upset by what happened. That my mom kept telling me she's fine, and still had good time with me made me fell even worse. Very unpleasant experience!

Also it was not expensive at all, but we didn't have any drinks.  I also ordered a kids menu for my 4 year old son and I thought it was great quality, with a good selection.

Pros: + 15-20 minute wait even with a large line + Super large portions Cons: - Sub par service (primarily due to such large restaurant)  Ambiance (5 stars): The restaurant looks really clean, and modern.  It has high ceilings and comfortable chairs. The washrooms are clean and spacious.   Food: (4.5 stars) Knowing their large portions we only got the main meal. I got a Burrito (4 stars) - super large and tasty. Smokehouse Burgers  (5 stars) - After recommendation from the waiter we got 2 of these instead of the Bacon Bacon Burger.  The burger was amazing.  One of the best burgers I ever had.   Real juicy with a generous portion of bacon and cheese and great sauce.  Would def recommend it.   A Salad with Salmon (5 stars) - All the ingredients were really fresh and they went well together.   Service: ( 3 stars) We order drinks at the start and then we ordered food.  We were given bread at the start, and most of the drinks about 5 minutes later.   We finished the bread, and still waited another 5 minutes for the drink (After reminding the waiter that the drink was missing he came back with it).

109,Eric S.,"Boston, MA",20,286,26.0,4.0,2016-01-04,"For a chain restaurant, this place never disappoints!  The waitstaff can sometimes be hit or miss, but the food is always stellar.  Some of my favorites include the Ahi Tartare (an appetizer dish consisting of a puck of chopped raw ahi tuna sitting on top of a puck of avocado, sitting in a pool of soy ginger sauce, topped with spicy mayo, pickled ginger, and sesame seeds, garnished with fried wonton chips.  It's a delightful Asian twist to a French dish (or a French twist to a Japanese dish, you decide!). Normally I opt for ordering two or three appetizers instead of an entree.  Another decent ""appetizer"" that's actually entree sized are the Thai Lettuce Wraps.  They're not authentic by any means, but they are DELICIOUS!  It's simple.  All you do is make a taco/burrito with fresh lettuce as the shell.  It comes with pickled carrots, noodles, chicken in a peanut sauce, parsley, cucumbers, and bean sprouts.  It also comes with three sauces.  I'm not quite sure what's in them, but they're all good! As for entrees, the sandwiches are very good, and the burgers are very good as well.  The burgers are actually quite large, and come with decent sized patties and generous portions of condiments such as lettuce, tomato, and onion.  Plus, they're cooked to order! After stuffing and/or gorging yourself on this delicious food, you might want to take your leftovers to go, then go home to hibernate, but what's this?  The waiter/waitress just brought you a dessert menu!  Oh no! You're stuffed!  But somehow you still have room for dessert!  Why would you come here if you're not going to have a slice of their namesake!  I usually either opt for the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake, or the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake.  I've tried the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake and have found it to be lacking a bit in the vanilla department.  The Hot Fudge Sundae is good too, but only order it if you intend on picking up a slice of cheesecake at the to-go counter up front!

147,Amy C.,"San Francisco, CA",299,410,1301.0,4.0,2016-01-21,"This review is simply for the cheesecakes and desserts at The Cheesecake Factory. I've never eaten a proper meal there, although I have seen their lunch and dinner menus, which seem overwhelming with the sheer number of items on the menu. From what I've heard, dessert is where The Cheesecake Factory excels, and entrees are not as much of a strength (mediocre and overpriced, from what I've heard). However, their cheesecakes are really phenomenal. They come in huge slices with mountains of whipped cream. As a whipped cream lover, I am a huge fan of the amount of whipped cream that goes onto these cheesecakes. They are perfect for sharing among a group of friends. Every July, The Cheesecake Factory restaurants nationwide also celebrate National Cheesecake Day with 50% of all cheesecake slices, so the cost of one slice drops down to about $3.50. One of my favorite desserts there (besides the cheesecakes) is the strawberry shortbread. This is a massive dessert with sugary, crunchy shortbread topped with a large quantity of fresh cut strawberries, with generous scoops of vanilla ice cream and swirls of whipped cream on top. At only $8 or $9, the amount of food is really good value.  The ambiance at this place is nice. It is a huge restaurant located in the Prudential Center, so even when there are a lot of patrons there isn't much of a wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=80,3.0,3.12,3.108,3.152,3.0720000000000005

Every time I have gone up against you I have lost, crawling back to the car with my tail between my legs and preparing for the imminent food coma. Your modest (but delicious!) assortment of vegetarian options like those rich, buttery, palpably artery-clogging garlic noodles with perfectly cut pieces of asparagus I dream about. Your stuffed mushroom appetizer that my boyfriend and I have a hard time splitting evenly (even with 6!) Not to mention those crunchy, oil soaked portobello, zucchini and avocado fries with assorted dipping sauces that taste so right. (I mean, it's full of veggies so it's good for you right?) All in all, a pretty standard Cheesecake Factory. We came for an early dinner once around 5pm (the ""blue-haired"" special!) and was seated as soon as the hostess was back to lead us to the table. Another day (Valentine's Day, actually) we came back around 9:30 and the quoted wait was over an hour! Since California Pizza Kitchen stopped taking orders ahead of its earlier 10pm closing time, we decided to go with takeout which easily fell within the 15-20 minute estimated wait. Although I could never hate the Cheesecake Factory when it consistently and reliably indulges my most gluttonous fantasies, my boyfriend did see a small mouse in the bathroom as we were getting ready to leave.

Birthdays, graduations, date-nights, just because - you name it. The Cheesecake Factory is a great place and also well-known, the service is slow, the menu too big, but great quality and pretty pricey. This time however, the service was the best service I've ever had at a Cheesecake.  The place was pretty busy, it was a Saturday around 6pm. We didn't make a reservation, which got me hesitant to go there because usually the wait is about 30mins -1 hour without a reservation and at least 10-20 with one. They say us down immediately, gave us our appetizer within 10 minutes of ordering it. The cooks really do have to be appreciated here. They did a fantastic job. Although the waiter didn't come around as often as I would have liked, especially not have my drink refilled, was slightly annoying, but everything was fast. The appetizer was interrupted by our entree of Steak Diane (slightly salty, but great meat and mashed potatoes!). Although mine was over the medium-cooked amount I asked, it was still great and made for even better leftovers. For dessert, my boyfriend and I split a cookie-dough slice of cheesecake. It wasn't very good, and I usually love love love cookie-dough. The piece of cheesecake seemed frozen and hard to chew and that was two hours later as we had gotten it to go because we were too stuffed to eat any more. From previous visits, the strawberries is whipped cream is way underrated and the banana cheesecake is the best!

209,Querby J.,"Everett, MA",122,66,137.0,3.0,2016-03-23,So this Cheesecake Factory has a lot of good and bad things about it. Okay let's first start off with the fact that they don't take reservations so depending on what day and time you go be prepared for a wait. Because I've been here before on a Saturday and it was packed with an hour wait. But I came here today on a Wednesday night and there was no wait at all. So it's pretty much luck of the draw. I went with a group of 4 and managed to get a booth seat. As an appetizer I got the buffalo wings. They were good but the skin was kind of chewy. The buffalo wings aren't that spicy so those with timid taste buds have no fear. My friend asked for the shrimp scampi pasta and they messed up her order so make sure your waiter understands your order. As a quick side note the bathroom here is mad nice. The lighting in there (and the whole restaurant at that) is really dim. Nice for the atmosphere but terrible for pictures (hence why my food pictures suck & I'm not a good photographer). My main dish I got the Cajan Jambalaya Pasta. I'm a person that enjoys extremely spicy food and the description of the Cajan Jambalaya Pasta said that it was in a very spice sauce and it really wasn't even that spicy. So don't be fooled. It's still a great dish though (enjoy the picture of me obnoxiously eating my pasta). For the desert I got the Dulce De Leche Cheesecake. Okay this had to be my favorite part of the meal! I'm not usually a fan of Cheesecake Factory cheesecake surprisingly. But this one has me re-questioning not liking their cheesecake because this cheesecake was fucking delicious! If you're a fan of caramel this is the one for you. Delicious and it cuts real smooth. Make sure to get the whip cream with it!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=140,2.88,3.18,3.092,3.1800000000000006,3.0600000000000005
186,Courtney T.,"Pawtucket, RI",190,5,,1.0,2016-04-02,"Cheesecake Factory in Cambridge, MA is beyond the most racist, impolite, and ridiculous restaurant I have ever gone too. First, a kid that was with my cousin and a group of friends went to go make a reservation for the 10 of us. They told him 2 hours and he walked away (he's Cape Verdean). Not even 15 minutes later I came back to make a reservation myself because we decided we would wait and for 15 people because more people came than expected. When I went in their, I was told one hour for 15 people. I would just like to say that is white privileges, obviously.  After the one hour (and a half) wait we were finally seated. During the wait, someone who was in our group was asked by his mother to buy some milk to bring home for the house. He did this before because CVS was closing at 9 and it was around 8:45. CVS gave him a brown paper bag for his two half gallons of milk that said CVS on it. After being seated after the long wait, we received a dirty table, dirty clothes, and dirty plates/silverware.  When the kid asked if they had milk for him to have with his food, they said that they did not have any. He then asked if the waitress could give him a cup so he could pour his milk into the cup. He even said they could charge him for the cup and continued to show them the milk that was in the paper bag. The waitress said ""Okay, I will be right back with everything."" After awhile of waiting, we saw not one, not two, not three, BUT FIVE police officers approaching us. When I asked what the situation or problem was they told us that a manager was told that we were pouring alcohol into our drinks. Mind you, we were there celebrating a friends birthday and my cousins confirmation!  The police officers then took the milk away and smelt it and declared that the milk was JUST MILK. They apologized then walked away. How embarrassing right? Due to the obvious fact that us and the waitress was uncomfortable I politely went up to a manager at the front desk and requested a new waiter/waitress because it was an embarrassing and awkward situation for not only us, but the waitress too. They said ""okay, yeah. No problem, I'll be right on that"". After the waitress coming back a total of 5 times, I went to the bathroom and decided to call my cousins mom. As I was telling her the story and what the police officers said to me and everything that was going on, a Manager who wasn't even dealing with my table got in my face screaming at me saying we were being disruptive and that she was going to kick us out if I didn't stop telling my Aunt the situation that was occurring. I told her that I'm on a personal phone call what I say is none of her business and that I said exactly what the officer told me he was called for. (The officer even asked us to see some of our drinks!). She then left the bathroom (didn't use the bathroom) while laughing and calling me a bitch. Due to this altercation, I was recorded by some girls in the bathroom behind me, so once again, an embarrassing situation. I could have been lying out of my ass (WHICH I WASN'T!) and she still had no right to put her two sense into my personal conversation. After the bathroom, I went to go talk to another manager. While I was gone she continuously walked by my table laughing then asked ""where is that white girl at"" (mind you she's a fat white girl, not that her physical appearance matters). When talking to the head managed, Clint I believe was his name, I was told that I was lying and that he knows these employees well and that both the girls saw a bottle of alcohol. No alcohol was found when the police searched us, our table, the bags, and our milk/drinks. Notice how he said two girls, we had one boy and one girl!  My uncle came in and demanded an apology and they offered an order on the house. We denied and said that we just wanted an apology. He continued to say we can afford our own food, just that we also deserved to be respected. We then checked everyone's receipt and made sure everything was paid for (I DID THIS MYSELF, PERSONALLY). We even left an extra $20 to show that we didn't come here for a scene and that we came here to eat properly. As the group tried to leave they stopped and said we still owed them money and that we didn't pay. They then argued for awhile saying we should have kept our receipt (they collected it from us). They then discovered that they made ANOTHER mistake and that we did pay and left the extra $20. Not that it matter since they even offered to put the order on the house!  There was a total of 12 of us for our 15 people reservation. I was the ONLY white one. Along with that, this all occurred before we even received our food. I didn't even eat it I was so aggravated that I lost my appetite. They even accused of us saying we put alcohol in our drinks (why would we even tell our server that if we did?)  Moral of the story: don't bring milk to CheeseCake Factory. You'll be arrested for underage drinking.they don't even deserve half a star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=200,2.84,3.18,3.084,3.0120000000000005,3.0440000000000005

What saved the day was of course the cheesecake.  We got the 'Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore' cheesecake, and it was pretty tasty.  Ended up taking everything home I couldn't finish, between the main course and the cheesecake I probably have 2 full meals worth of food in my fridge right now from Cheesecake Factory, the portion sizes are pretty big.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=200,2.84,3.2,3.092,3.34,3.0560000000000005

She didn't say anything to us or the lady. Hmmm... Eventually we got to the table but...that was annoying.  Waiter was friendly and helpful, but just sort of..disappeared after we got our food. After we were done eating, we were searching for him so we could get the check.  Food was good, all in all.

The chicken was overcooked so it was dry and stringy and had no seasoning and also was too large for the sandwich.  It also was not a club sandwich; usually clubs are three pieces of thinly sliced bread, not two very thick pieces. I think you should rethink this menu item and evaluate the preparation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=160,3.12,3.23,3.092,3.1120000000000005,3.186

We placed an order for a 6in chocolate mousse cheesecake and the cashier asked if we were OK with it being frozen. We said yes, paid, took our receipt, and then waited. 10 minutes flew by and we noticed the staff standing around doing nothing. So we asked about our order with a different cashier. She told us she didn't know about our order and went to check. She came back and said they'd run out of the 6inch cake but they had a 7inch. She went to get her manager, who then came up to us and said, ""Sorry we can't do that."" We were sooooo confused. Apparently cashier #2 told him we wanted the 7inch cake for the price of the 6inch. We hadn't asked for that. At all. So then he wanted to offer us a free slice on top of the 7inch cake that we had to pay the difference for. Nope, that's when we had had enough of this and asked for our money back.  Sorry, but I'm not stepping into a place of business where the manager starts off an apology by accusing us.

Our waiter, Paco, was good, he was able to remember who ordered ice water, water with no ice, and lemon with water. He was patient when we told him to come back so we could have more time to decide what to order. I ordered the California avocado lunch salad without onions. The salad was recommended by the waiter. I ordered the salad with dressing on the side because Americans love to slather their salads with dressing which I don't like. My dish was presented nicely and there was a cup of dressing on the side. However as I started to eat my salad, I noticed that the dressing was mixed in. I was disappointed but decided to eat super-dressed salad. If you're going for salads, I highly recommend sweetgreen over salads from cheesecake. After we finished eating, we ordered 2 desserts to share: 30th anniversary chocolate cheesecake and the strawberry shortcake. Never ever ever order the strawberry shortcake. The cake was dry and tasted really old. The ice cream and strawberries weren't able to recover the dish on their own. I'm not a huge fan of cheesecakes, but the cheesecake was 10x better than the shortcake. We only ordered the shortcake because the person we wee congratulating isn't a fan of cheesecake.

101,Ariana P.,"Brighton, MA",0,5,,1.0,2017-01-08,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for a reunion dinner. While planning, we called ahead and asked for a reservation. The first time we called, we were told that they did not take reservations. The second time another member called, someone allowed a reservation for us at 4:30.  When we arrived, we were told there was no reservation under our name so we had to get a pager and wait 30 minutes and that was fine. The part that was the most appalling part was when a waitress (not even a hostess) called out the name of our party's name. She kept calling so we went up. She looked at us, we said the party's name and then she looked at us with a disapproving look and said ""Is your pager buzzing?"" When we responded no, she said ""Nice try."" Um, since when did we need to prove our identity? She continued to call the party's name but no one stepped up. So they moved on to another table. We waited another 20 minutes before we knew that we had been waiting way over a half hour. So my party went up and asked about the reservation as well as when we would be seated. They conveniently said that we were next. When we were lead to our table, we were seated at a booth meant for four with a chair at the end. No other booth had that kind of arrangement. It looked like the table had been put together in a rush and last minute. My party was positive that the table being called earlier was ours.  The rest of our experience was okay. The service from our waiter was okay, but there could definitely be room for improvement. I would like to think that the waiter was new and was trying to still get the hang of things. The food was as expected.  I am very put off by the way the staff talked to us, as if we were trying to take someone else's place in line. No one else was coming forward and the name they had been calling was one of my party members. We genuinely thought that she was calling our party. I felt that it was very unnecessary for the hostess to talk to us that way. We were polite the entire time as well as treated the staff with respect. I am not sure that person should be in an industry that involves being nice to customers. What I noticed the biggest problem about this location is the staff. The host/hostess stand seemed very unorganized, the waitstaff seemed to be less than thrilled to be there.

First time we came right before closing time, around 11:30 pm so I dont really want to blame the bad experience on anyone but us. But you should avoid going this time if you can. The waiter didnt give us bread, which I figured due to the closing of the bakery. However, he didnt mention or apologize about it. The main course was so so. For dessert, we asked for cheesecake and was informed that they were no whipped cream since they are closed. I said it's fine but somehow we ended up with whipped cream anyway. I discussed with my hubby to bring the cake home since I dont want to make the staff wait for us any longer. So when my husband told the waiter to just box the cake and get the check, he said he already ordered it to go (???) Again, It's midnight, I dont blame him but yeah this isnt the best time to visit.

I'm not an Italian food expert but I know cabonara's sauce is made with cheese and eggs, but it was with cream. I was so white and wet that it's more like a alfredo sauce. It was still delicious but thats just misbranding. And again, no water was refilled. The waitress this time was nice though. On the plus side, the cheesecakes was delicious both time.

It was awful. The chicken tasted like the scraps that aren't good enough to use on their main entrees, and it was full of peanuts and WAY too much celery.  The bread was too buttery and was soggy.

I know what to expect with any location that I visit. In the rare cases where they haven't delivered to my expectations, managers have stepped in to rectify for either quality (e.g., food came out cold) or service (e.g., unusually long wait for an order or waiter messed up the order). The menu is broad, you can come back over and over again to try something new. The portions are also generous (although I have noticed that they are a bit smaller these days than in the past - not sure if that is a trend or a few one-offs).

My boyfriend's pancakes were dry and came with maple syrup that was the consistency of milk and the color of a man's ejaculation.

I ordered a spinach dip, quesadilla, BBQ chicken pizza, and a slice of cheesecake. The spinach dip lacked cheese and was overall just very plain. The quesadilla was on the soggy side and although we ordered the ""plain"" quesadilla (aka the one without chicken) there was only cheese inside and on the side was some salsa, sour cream and guac (though the guac was quite good and tasted fresh). The BBQ chicken pizza was good since BBQ on pizza is such a great combination....but otherwise the cheese was not very stringy/cheesy, and it was just a plain pizza. Their cheesecake was quite good, we ordered their 30th anniversary cake and it was layers of cheesecake and chocolate cake; although it was very sweet, it was quite satisfying. Their menu is quite extensive so perhaps I can try out their other dishes.....but I kinda don't have the urge to.  Service wise, our server was kind but he never came back to check up on us, and he never bothered to refill our drinks. We tried to wave him down several times but he never looked.

73,Taryn S.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",1,31,,5.0,2017-02-15,"My favorite restaurant is The Cheesecake Factory. I like The Cheesecake Factory        because of the food. I also like how it looks. My last reason is the dessert.                     I think the food is very delicious. There is lots of food on the menu but I like the grilled cheese because it is not over cooked. I also like fries with my grilled cheese. I think the fries are the best because they aren't too hot or too cold. There is pizza and lots more. The waiters also give you free bread with butter when you sit down. They give you any kind of bread you ask for if they have it. I like the plain bread. That is why I love the food at The Cheesecake Factory.   Another reason why I love The Cheesecake Factory is because of how it looks. There are benches with a rectangular table across. But if you want there are chairs with pillows on them around a circular table. When you are done and waiting for your check there are couches to sit on. I think The Cheesecake Factory looks awesome. It looks like a very cool restaurant. The one I go to is in a mall, on the bottom floor of the Prudential.  Finally we get to the delicious dessert. Its called The Cheesecake Factory for a reason because the restaurant makes cheesecake! Also if it is your birthday you can have cheesecake and an ice cream sundae. There is LOTS of kinds of cheesecake. Some flavors are plain, oreo, and strawberry cheesecake but, there is WAY more!!The dessert is SO yummy, you should probably go and get some!

I had never been to a CF before and the menu was extensive. However, I didn't want something really heavy as I had a lot more walking to do. I ordered the Buffalo chicken sandwich, and my wife had their burger. Both meals came quickly. My chicken was fried perfectly with ample lettuce and tomato and I was 1/2 through it when I realized there was either no Buffalo sauce or it was so scantly applied as to be missing. They brought me more and that was nice. My wife enjoyed her burger. We split a piece of lime cheesecake, which was very flavorful and tart and not too sweet. The atmosphere was loud, dimly lit (it got darker as the meal went on, as if they turned the lights down), and very compressed. Since it is at a mall, perhaps it is like this every Saturday for dinner.

The menu here is vast... but there is something to accommodate every taste. Fish, chicken, beef, turkey or vegetarian. My favorites are signature the avocado egg rolls and the fire cracker Salmon. These are appetizers but I usually get them as a meal and they are perfectly filling.  The price point is reasonable. Entrees typically don't go past 20.00 dollars here. Of course you can't end dinner at the factory with the cheesecake! Get the cheesecake and damn your diet! It's so very worth it.

He found Denise and she argued with him for about 5 minutes telling him that it's normal procedure to heat up already eaten food and put it back on the grill to warm it up(why would you warm up a med well steak that was supposed to be med rare) still didn't apologize, said she was correct several times and that he was wrong. In this time another manger Sam came over. She was the nicest person we came across the entire night, and made sure we were as happy as we could be,and actually apologized for her co workers. About 15 minutes later the new steak got delivered Denise who threw it on the table and walked away.  Not once did Any one except Sam apologize. This was by far the worst restaurant experience I've ever had and all we got out of it was a free piece of steak. So next time you think about going to the cheese cake factory, just remember your food is being cooked on the same grill as half eaten steak, as Denise reassured us SEVERAL times.

IF you want to get to this Cheesecake Factory (CF), you should exit at the E line of the green at prudential, takes you right out to where CF is in the mall. This CF honestly has a great location, so you probably won't miss it. Ever since I came to America, I've been a huge fan of the Cheesecake factory, primarily because they serve almost everything possibly imaginable here. The second reason I love this place in general is because of the crazy high calorie dishes they serve here. Some dishes here regularly make the ""Dishes with the Highest Number of Calories by Chain Restaurant"" lists: for instance, the chicken and garlic farfalle (according to the menu) has 2190 calories in just one serving. It's amazing, and only appropriate for special occasions.  This particular CF is not much different from other locations. The waitstaff is fine, and generally friendly, and if i recall correctly, the food comes out blazingly fast. I will say however that it is a little bit too dimly lit here, and wish that they would improve the lighting if possible.

Hadn't been to the cheese cake factory in almost 2 years, & was beyond excited to come here. Fail. My boy friend, & I were seated and it took about 20 mins for someone to come over to us. When I saw and heard our waitresses slurred speech it all made sense. (SHE WAS ON DRUGS) At that moment my boy friend said ""should we just leave now"" but me being Hangry at this point figured the food would be out in no time although we still hadn't received our drinks or bread for table. I then grabbed a bus boy who was cleaning the table next to us and politely asked him to find our waitress since now it had been a half our since we were seated and the only thing on our tables were menus. The waitress came back over and pointed at me and repeated my drink out loud like she had forgotten them disappeared for another 20 mins. Now almost one hour prior to arrival I finally got up and found a manager whose name was (RYAN) I told him what was going on and he already knew who my waitress was and described her to the T. He then said that she had numerous complaints and her behavior had progressively gotten worse through out the night. I told him we were just going to leave and he pleaded and begged for me to stay saying he would take care of the check and was very sorry for what was happening. I went back to the table and they brought out our bread, one app, and on entree at the same time. I said to the food runner isn't the whole point of appetizers so it comes out prior to your meal, & with the other apps we ordered? Not one and one?! I was beyond frustrated at this point and asked the food runner to take the entree back and bring out our other app. We ordered buffalo blasts with ranch on the side and Mac and cheese balls. The buffalo blasts came out right away but there was no ranch so we waited and waited and waited for about 15 mins until the buffalo blasts were ice cold so we didn't eat them. We only ate the Mac and cheese balls. The manager told showed us who was supposed to be taken care of us for the rest of the night the only time he checked on me was when he asked if I wanted to comp the entree since it had been sitting in the kitchen and was now cold.. I told him well I would hope they would make and send me out a new entree since it's not my fault our waitress was busy getting high in the bathroom.. then was very confused because the manager had just begged me to stay saying he would comp the bill. Our new waiter disappears and my self and boy friend are just awkwardly sitting there with empty drinks thinking sooo are we all set then since he said it was taken care of and no one has come over to us for 30 mins. So we got up and walked over to the cheese cake counter to take desert home since we didn't touch anything but our one app we knew we would be hungry later the SO CALLED MANAGER chases us over causing a scene saying we were DINNING AND DASHING! I was mortified and began to cry I couldn't believe this and him causing a scene did he not remember the conversation we just had!? Probably not because it was a long dreadful 21/2 hour of painful waiting later. He claimed he said he would only comp one thing off the bill and not entire bill although we only touched one plate... he didn't take anything off the bill and charged us 70$ in full for food and a miserable experience.  I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN.

26,Ajay V.,"Boston, MA",1,4,,4.0,2017-10-21,Had the most succulent and amazing Red Velvet Cheesecake and the High Tower Chocolate cake. I also loved their vegetarian pasta options. Their Fried Cauliflower with hot Sauce was amazing and worth the amount.  Best Italian food I have ever eaten in a long time.

Cheesecake is always great, service is friendly and quick, and the 600 calorie and under ""Skinny"" menu is great.

37,Amy M.,"Brookline, MA",13,12,10.0,2.0,2017-11-13,I don't really like to eat here unless it's for the deserts. The food is good and service too but it really depends on what type of server you get. First time eating there with my girls I got the Diane steak which was burnt and one side was just burnt black pepper. Another time I had ordered the hibachi steak the waiter took it away saying it's not my order and gave me a steak that's a credit card size. I never met a waiter like that. It's pretty much always busy so don't be afraid to get your plate right.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=20,3.32,3.24,3.184,,3.2720000000000007
8,Ilana Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,35,26.0,4.0,2017-12-03,"We waited around 20 minutes for a seat, which isn't bad. The place was full around 5 pm, which is pretty early for a Saturday night. When we got to our seats, the silverware was dirty so we asked for a new set. Our waiter didn't come to our table often, and we had to wait a while to get our drinks, bread, and for him to take our order. Definitely could've had better service. Other than that, this is your usual Cheesecake Factory. The menu is huge and has so many options! We shared a small plate of greek salad, spinach dip, and loaded tater tots. They were all delicious and the portions are huge even for appetizers. For the main dishes, we got a bacon-bacon burger and eggplant parm. We had a lot to take home as well! For dessert we shared a carrot cake cheesecake which was so yummy!!! Definitely recommend if you're shopping in the Prudential Center and looking for a place that hits the spot!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston,3.32,3.24,3.184,,3.2720000000000007
2,Rebecca A.,"Biddeford, ME",61,53,130.0,5.0,2017-12-10,"I love coming here! The atmosphere, service and of course the food is always fantastic. Oh and you can't forget about the CHEESECAKE!!  On this visit we decided to order from the lunch sized options which are supposed to be smaller but truly you get an amazing portion. I had the spaghetti and meatballs that was very delicious and Judy got the pepperoni and sausage pizza with a salad. She had honey mustard for her dressing and it was the best honey mustard I've had, definitely homemade. The pizza was amazing, so much flavor. For dessert you guessed it cheesecake!! Judy had the celebration cheesecake which was spectacular and I had the caramel pecan turtle cheesecake, decadent!! Great as always!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston,3.32,3.24,3.188,,3.2720000000000007
24,Daniella S.,"Boston, MA",179,67,80.0,2.0,2017-12-11,"Worst service I've experienced. My table of 3 waited 45 minutes (at our table) before anyone took our order. We were starving, no one was bringing any bread or anything until later. I ordered the veggie burger and the bun was very very soggy. It fell apart after the first bite. I wish our waitress would have kept us updated at least on the status of our food or something. I've been to CF before and this visit was truly a disappointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=20,3.28,3.22,3.192,,3.2440000000000007

0,Tony C.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,1,2.0,4.0,2017-12-31,Arrived at Boston last night and this is the only restaurant at 11:30 pm. Great service from the staff but the food were not as hot as we expected. Boston was freezing and the food were just warm. We ordered a burger and omelette with fries. The burger was tasty beef and the omelette was well fried with ham inside. Two dishes were well enough for two. Later we took away a chesscake and back to hotel for breakfast. We took it in the next morning and it still tasted good. Just one point to improve not hot enough for the food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston,3.36,3.25,3.2,,3.294
1,Ellen Y.,"Boston, MA",192,183,39.0,1.0,2018-01-01,"I'm genuinely upset. Cheesecake Factory is always a slow but good time, but I usually walk out feeling okay! Today was such a different story. We should have known the moment we walked in the back entrance! There were no signs indicating that we were at the back, and we had to awkwardly walk through the whole restaurant for the front.  We got there around 5:30, and was told 25 min for a table of 6. We were seated around 6:10, after I checked in with the hostess how long the wait would be. Our waiter took about 5 min to come to us the first time, and he seemed REAL flustered. My friend asked what the soup of the day was, and he looked at her blank faced saying that he ""doesn't normally work Monday's so he doesn't know and will check"". Every time he left our table, it took him FOREVER to come back. We could not get his attention!! The food was mediocre this time. My friend asked for a medium mushroom burger, but parts of it was DEFINITELY rare. The seasoning on the mashed potatoes was off, but the honey truffle chicken was good. I got the Evelyn's pasta, which was eh. It was a good mix of vegetables, but it all ended up tasting the same. The menu said it came with rigatoni pasta, but I definitely got a few elbows in there. My friend got the shrimp angel hair pasta, which she said just tasted not special. Overall, the extensive menu at cheesecake is overwhelming, but I don't think there's a terrible option.  THIS IS WHEN IT GETS SO MUCH WORSE. We literally waited 45 min between finishing eating to leaving the restaurant. Our server was just too busy. Every time we asked for something, it would take him over 10 min to come back and ask us to repeat what we just said. We even told him in the beginning that we had somewhere to be, but he did not seem to get that. Dinner should not take 2.5 hours when we just got an entree!  We were actually fuming when we walked out. Sat in silence in the Uber back home. Do not recommend this location!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston,3.36,3.21,3.196,,3.27
5,Fion W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",62,1,3.0,5.0,2018-01-03,"It's really tasty. Both of dessert and main course. We ordered chicken farfalla and strawberry cheesecake.  The cheesecake texture is creamy, and the strawberry are juicy. And the chicken farfalla is fantastic use fry chicken breast but not dry, and the pasta is chewy. All the seasoning is alright! Strongly recommended!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston,3.4,3.22,3.204,,3.2920000000000007
3,Shalaka J.,"San Jose, CA",43,53,13.0,4.0,2018-01-11,Good food as always! Had the chicken taquitas and mushrooms. Finished up with the lovely cheesecake with strawberries and fresh cream. Took my sister here she enjoyed am glad. Special mention of the bread they give. Try the brown one (may be it is a rye bread) put some butter on top and have it. It is gorgeous!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston,3.36,3.21,3.2,,3.27
