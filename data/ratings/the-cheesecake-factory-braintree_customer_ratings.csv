124,Mandie R.,"Warwick, RI",71,35,2.0,4.0,2012-02-01,"This is my first time visiting this location as I usually go to the one in Providence with my boyfriend. I found this spot to be just as nice but not as crowded. I was happy to see that they have added a healthier menu filled with low calorie/fat  drinks,appetizers and entrees. They however do not have a dessert menu but no complaints as I rarely ever finish a meal nevermind have room for dessert. I decided to try the Skinny Red Sangria and it was delicious you would never know that it was a diet version of the original (which I have tried in the past) I also got the Skinnylicious Salmon Rolls even though they were an appetizer they were just enough to fill me up. I left the restaurant not feeling overly full but satisfied. I also liked coming out knowing I didn't ruin my diet for the week as I am trying to lose some more weight for a ball gown I need for a Military ball I'll be attending in a couple months. I look forward to trying more from this menu. I just wish more restaurants had these types of options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=200,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.152,3.0000000000000004

The wait is usually a little longer than I love to wait with a toddler, but last time I went the hostess that sat us suprised me & asked if she could bring the baby Bread & Bananas - ""WHAT, ABsolutley?!?!?""... It soo occupied him & he was having the greatest little time with his plate... Kept him from that akward before his food gets there moments...  Food was as always - DELISH...

80,Kemi A.,"Portland, OR",131,654,34.0,4.0,2012-02-15,"What can I say about the Cheesecake Factory that hasn't been said before? There's a reason why this is a cult favorite among family, friends, and coworkers. The Cheesecake Factory is simply the shit.  It's important that you have reservations, otherwise you'll be noshing on the cheesecake on display before you are given a table. The staff are very friendly and polished, so it makes you feel like you're at a very posh place. The menu is extensive, I'm not kidding it's as thick as a Bible! Do yourself a favor and check online before you go in. The CF does a good job with variety, but if you're looking for something halfway healthy, GTFO. There's also options for vegetarians/vegans, but not so much. Always ask your server before you order.  I was there on a business lunch, and the food was delicious! We started with stuffed mushrooms, eggplant rolls, and popcorn shrimp as appetizers. Then I had the seared salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus--yum! That and with a strawberry lemonade drink made my life complete.  After stuffing yourself with 2308345893485 calories, you have to have cheesecake!! What kind? Well when I looked it was over 40+ of them. I had the Pecan cheesecake which was to die for, good luck trying to eat it all after that big meal!

They weren't horrible. They just seem to be more tasty in the past.  I also ordered firecracker shrimp which was delicious!  It was a very good experience all around.  I'm not a big fan of cheesecake so I can't rate the cheesecake.  I'm not too sure why this place gets so crazy busy...I find it to be just an okay restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=240,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.9880000000000004,3.2000000000000006
116,Katie C.,"Boston, MA",180,587,92.0,4.0,2012-03-18,"I don't understand why the Cheesecake Factory is always so busy.  Even on a dreary Tuesday night, there can be a half hour - to an hour wait.  The folks in the corporate offices are nothing short of geniuses.  First and foremost, the waiting area is in front of a dessert case.  So unless you venture outside of the restaurant, you'll be sitting in front of cheesecake displays for a half hour - to an hour.  Even if there is no wait, you'll still be forced to wait several minutes in front of the case.  So when it comes time at the end of the meal ... hell yes you'll want dessert! My favorite part of the Cheesecake Factory is the salads.  The portion sizes of all their entrees are ridiculously large, so if you're going to shovel away some food, make it a salad.  I typically get the barbecue chicken salad with the barbecue ranch dressing on the side and it is quite delicious.  If I decide to forego the onion straws on top, it's relatively healthy, too.  The service is professional, and I've never had a problem with being served an incorrect meal.  It's a little on the expensive side, but when you consider the portion sizes, you certainly get what you pay for! The cheesecake is extremely rich and when it's $6 - $8 per slice, you can easily make your own cheesecake for $8 using ingredients you most likely already have at home!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=180,3.24,3.24,3.24,3.056,3.2400000000000007
283,Jack L.,"Boston, MA",135,6,1.0,1.0,2012-04-08,"Our waiter Brian S was not good at all. When one of my of my friend wanted to order a drink he kept walking away when she didn't even finish talking yet. Second is we waited for a refill on water for 15 minute when is not busy at all, he was actually watching television at the bar. Finally when he walks by I ask him for water and he fill it to the top where I can't even move the glass without spilling it. The final thing is he left us to go box to pack in case we didn't finish our dinner when we didn't even finish eating yet. I believe that if a guest want their dinner to go the waiter or waitress suppose to pack it for you. But we had to pack it ourselves and there were no bags for us to put it in until we ask for it. I felt like our waiter Brian S was paying more attention to what's on the television then on the guest. We were going to order dessert after dinner but the service was so disappointing we end up going somewhere else for it.  I have been a lot of restaurant for dinner and by far this is the worst service I ever  had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=280,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.724,3.1600000000000006
129,Kathy Y.,"Boston, MA",182,89,6.0,3.0,2012-04-09,"We came here on a Saturday Night around dinnertime, peaktime, 7pm.  Of course we expected that there would be an hour wait, which we totally didn't mind.  We were seated and the waitress took our orders immediately as it wasn't our first time there.  We already knew what we wanted. We shared an appetizer The Avocado Eggrolls - Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion and Cilantro Fried in a Crisp Wrapper. Served with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce.  This was okay, it wasn't as crispy as I expected it to be. We all ordered pastas for our main entrees.  We had finished our appetizer already and were waiting quite a while.  We had wondered what was taking so long as our entrees took over a half an hour after the appetizer to come out.  We wanted to ask what was going on and what was taking so long.   But nobody was around.  When we were finally going to ask, the waitress just came by and said sorry it's taking so long, it should be right out.  No explanations as to why. Our food finally came out after waiting a little longer.  The manager than came out to apologize about how long it took and explained that the pot that they used to boil pastas malfunctioned and it took a long time since all of us ordered pastas.  I guess at least he came to apologize about the wait.   I had the  Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic - Bow-Tie Pasta, Chicken, Mushrooms, Tomato, Pancetta, Peas and Caramelized Onions in a Roasted Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce.  This is always excellent and didnt' disappoint me.  Portion sizes are big at the cheesecake factory as regulars should already know.  I ended up taking half of it home.    I ordered a red velvet cheesecake to go.  This was a disappointment sadly, I swear the portion sizes for cheesecake use to be larger in the past. Overall the food is still good there, the staff was nice, but the wait was just a little longer than usual this past night we went.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=200,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.9880000000000004,3.1600000000000006

The potstickers were ok but then when my pasta dish came out,I could tell it was sitting for awhile. There was barely any sauce and the shrimp were so overcooked that they were like rubber. When our server finally came to see how everything was I told her how bad the shrimp were and she offered to replace them.  I was not about to wait for them to attempt to make a new batch. She brought the manager over who was nice and said she would adjust the bill and when we got it, she took $4.45 off of a $17 pasta dish.

174,Hector K.,"Boston, MA",19,7,,2.0,2012-07-20,"I recently went to the Cheesecake factory with a couple of my sisters. It took a while for us to be seated, but that's because we got there right in the middle of the dinner rush. Waiting wasn't too bad because you get to look at all the nice cheesecakes in the case. Eventually, we got a booth, which was huge, even though there were only three of us. It looked like it was made for eight people. We had their buffalo chicken appetizer, which was good, but you can't really screw up buffalo chicken at a restaurant. For my entrée, I ordered the shepherd's pie. It was pretty good, but it was nowhere near great. The ground beef didn't taste that good, and the mushroom sauce wasn't really that good either. The mashed potatoes on top were good, as were the vegetable mixed on the bottom mixed in with the beef. Overall, it was an okay dish, but I do expect better from them. I've been to a different Cheesecake Factory location before, and the food was great, but that's probably because I ordered a different dish. I got the Chicken Chipotle Pasta before, which was wonderful, and the portion is huge. Anyway, after that, I got dessert. I had mango key lime cheesecake, which was great, although they put way too much whipped cream on my plate. I don't understand why I need whipped cream on the cheesecake and three more piles of it on the plate. I didn't end up paying much, even though I ate a lot. So, you get a lot of food without spending too much money, which is always good in my opinion. Of course, I have to mention the wait staff. Our waiter was extremely nice, but he was a little frazzled. He seemed kind of all over the place. So, it took longer than usual for us to get things like extra bread or another glass of water, but I guess that comes with going to a restaurant at their busiest hour. Either way, he was nice, but I think he talked too much. Overall, I think I had a good experience there. I'd recommend going earlier in the day, though, when it's a little quieter and there are no children running the next table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=240,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.8560000000000003,2.92

178,M O.,"Randolph, MA",2,21,,2.0,2012-07-24,"Over the last few years, I found that the quality of their entrees have declined. I went there several years ago and enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. My last visit proved to be a relatively expensive disappointment.  Our first negative experience was the wait. Understandabley, a popular chain restaurant like this would have a long wait which we were okay with. However, when parties of 2 that put their names in after us got seated before us, we started to get fed up since we had been waiting for over an hour when the expected wait time was half an hour to 45 minutes.  When we finally sat down and got our food, we were further disappointed. My boyfriend and I didn't order anything that would take too long to make since at that point, we were pretty hungry after the wait. He got an omelette and I got an order of fish tacos. After another half hour, our food finally came but it seemed like the food had been sitting out for at least 15 minutes before it arrived at our table. The fish tacos were soggy and had absorbed all the juices from the tomatoes and the omelette was cold. If our food had been brought to us when it was ready instead of sitting on the counter by the kitchen, it would have tasted much different.  Sadly, I probably will not go back to this particular Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=240,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.8880000000000003,2.92

I got the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and it was good, but it had a lot of green and red peppers and onions and very little pieces of chicken and even pasta for that matter. But it was good.

The menu said red onion.  I know they weren't out of red onion since there was a slice on the burger.  The eggplant sandwich was tasty, but rather difficult to eat since the juices kept dripping out of the other side. I don't think I'd actually consider it ""incredible"".   Lettuce and a slice of tomato were on the side, the tomato didn't look appetizing so I did not add it to my sandwich.  The skinny-licious burger was tiny; we could've just ordered the regular burger,cut it in half and saved the other half, and half of the calories for  tomorrow's lunch.  The skinny-licious salads  were okay, nothing special.  A few pieces of lettuce were wilted.  Service was good.  We ordered our cheesecake to go, since we were full.

We sat at the other side of the bar and she literally stayed on the opposite side the entire time. My brother didn't get a chance to order his food until the older bartender came back.

As with all the locations, there is a wait. The location was clean and parking was kind of difficult, being in a mall on a Saturday I was expecting a wait and parking far away from it.  Once seated it took a little time for our server to get to us. Our drink order arrived and the only drink that was screwed up was, of course, mine. I ordered a light beer, but got a regular, no worries though, it was good.  our order arrived haphazardly and with some delay in the dishes. I'm used to the whole table being served at the same time, not one plate every 5 minutes or so.  As far as the meal quality itself, it was good. I ordered the Filet Minion and it was ok, I ordered med rare and it arrived medium.  As like all the other locations, it was packed.  The location was clean and pleasant.

280,Amanda P.,"Weymouth, MA",0,1,,1.0,2014-07-17,"Always been a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory and was there last month for lunch and had a great experience.  So two nights ago (a Tuesday night), I took my boyfriend there for his birthday.  We waited 30 minutes to be seated-we'd been told 20 but not a big deal.  We sat and ordered bar drinks...our server couldn't tell us the beers they had.  We asked her which Sam Adams' beer they had and she answered ""seasonal?"" Like she was asking us.  She seemed either new or too young to be familiar with beers/alcohol so also, no big deal. The place was packed so we were patient. Five minutes later we put in an app of buffalo blasts (which was sadly the best part of our meal)...and another 15 minutes later we got out appetizer-but still didn't have drinks.  We ended up asking for the manager...who did absolutely nothing but say they were busy-we didn't even get an apology.  There looked to be two bartenders on and the bar itself was half full...one of the bartenders was on her phone (texting or checking Facebook maybe) Then, our server proceeded to avoid us...luckily we'd already ordered our meals.  When the meals came, she did come back about ten minutes later to check how they were-we said ok but only to avoid making her feel any worse. They were both absolutely horrible-my chicken sandwich was dried out and the plate burnt my hand-it must have sat under the heat lamps for awhile.  My boyfriends fish and chips were mostly breading with minuscule bits of what we really hope was fish inside.  He's a huge seafood person and couldn't tell the type of fish they used. I've worked in restaurants my whole life and couldn't believe how bad the service was...and it was a combination of a lot of things, but none of it was our poor servers fault.

My 3 stars, I'm sure would not make or break them...they're popular n always crowded. Please keep in mind that I have always been a fan since this chain opened up its 1st at The Atrium, chestnut hills. Like most chain restaurants (Maggiano's), they tend to change up things n stupidities took over. My reviews: Pro's. .. fave item...my passionfruit ice tea. -The  honey wheat brown loaf..still ok -Spaghetti n Meatball w/Italian Sausage Sauce...a new item. Yum...must try if craving for this all-time comfort food. Tasty sauce meatballs...not as heavy as expected. The fresh basils added a special touch. -Mini bite menu: Zucchini, Avocado,  Mushroom Frites. Crispy not greasy...accompanied w/2 kinds of sauces...only liked 1 of the 2. Cons: -Tex Mex Egg Rolls...more salty than usual! They did away w/their usual green sauce n replaced it w/some watered-down sour cream and a splash of red something sauce on top. Good thing is, they plated it w/limes this time, without having to ask for it... when they once have that green sauce! CCF, do yourself as favor, stop messing up them sauces! If it's not broken..why fix it?! - My once fave pasta dish, Chix Marsala w/mushroom over Bowties...tasteless n bland. Needs some sauce ppl..not just a tablespoon of it drizzled on!!  I'm not giving up my fave, but I'll make sure I'll ask them to serve it up w/sauce...please!!! -Our server, sloppy! Settings were opened up from their usual wrapping w/the napkin...the knife was found at the seat next to me. When asked for another setting, she came back 20min later w/still wet utensils scattered over the table...no napkin this time! I washed it with my tea...didn't feel like waiting for another 20. Came back but then, didn't clear out our table. Btw, they gave us next next-available-seating, at the outdoor patio. *Sigh* wanna go home...stressed out a bit between the waitress, cool July nite, n then a heated lamp next to me...seems like I'm getting my hair done at a salon.. My BFF n I ordered cheesecakes to go. I got mines up at the counter. The few waitstaffs waiting for their cheesecakes were very nice...suggestions on flavors to the indecisive me! The guy, Aldwyn B, who took my cheesecake order was calmed n chilled under all that madness. Even when I was deciding between 2 flavors. Very helpful n patient.

187,Angela M.,"Brighton, MA",121,9,4.0,1.0,2014-08-27,"Let me start off by saying The Cheesecake Factory is my all time favorite restaurant. That being said this is the worst location I have ever been to. I typically would not take my time to come on here for a bad review especially because every time is not going to be the best experience - but when the last three times have all been AWFUL experiences I figured I should voice it after all it is my money that went to waste. 1st bad experience - we were told it was a 20 minute wait turned into waiting for 45 minutes. We got seated our server was never informed another 10 minutes before we were approached. I don't blame her I get it they were too busy for their staff to manage correctly she was very pleasant. I was with a friend we both ordered same meal the Fettuccini with Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoe which is my favorite but not when it comes out with watered sauce and no flavor. The server explained they had new cooks... I never send my food back but we did. We opted with just getting apps but by the time we actually got them neither of us we're hungry so we ended up getting to go boxes. To put in perspective we got there at 6 and didn't leave until 9:30 between the ""20 minute wait"" and everything else. 2nd bad experience - we were seated in the bar which is fine different server again wasn't told we were seated eventually made it over and apologized - but it wasn't a busy night. I believe then our salads were forgotten to be entered because the people who came after us with pasta dishes came out before ours. 3rd bad experience - this past weekend sat outside with the nice weather at a DIRTY table with no silverware or plates server drops off the bread and runs for the hills. Didn't make a big deal just ate at the dirty table had another employee grab us silverware. We order our food and my friends food comes out completely wrong. Again didn't bother to complain.

64,Thomas W.,"Roslindale, MA",23,11,6.0,1.0,2014-10-08,"Let me start this by saying that Cheesecake Factory restaurants, overall, are great locations for eating out. The granite Abe south shore plaza location is a growing FAILURE. From management to the chefs, this location struggles on a regular basis. Case in point- I ordered a Louisiana Chicken Pasta to go from the location. I arrived and waited for the order outside. After several minutes I finally decided to just go in and get it. The server told me they were bringing it out from the kitchen that moment. I went home. What I received looked as if it had been microwaved several times over. The chicken was hard and near plastic- it just wasn't edible . Clearly they had not just cooked this but decided to throw this in the warmer and, with no care, just shove it out to me. I noticed this terrible meal, called the restaurant and received a ""manager""... He told me they would send a gift card in the mail... LIES- nothing came (after a week) an I called back to the restaurant to deal with the matter. I was told they did not have a manager by that name and that I would have to come back in again to deal with it. I reordered the same meal and THEY DID IT AGAIN- same disgusting rewarmed leftover from someone else's plate.  The manager was immediately contCted and told he would remake it and it would be to my liking. I took that THIRD plate of the same meal home... What do you think happened- THE SAME DISGUSTING LEFTOVER REWARMED GARBABGE.  So, I would suggest going to cheesecake and utterly avoiding the braintree south shore location.... They can't get it right. Don't believe me - take a peek at the pics of this terrible meal.  By the way, I wish yelp allowed for 1/2 stars.

Overall, at this location we had great service and sat at one of the ""bar"" tables. It always kills me how fancy Cheesecake Factory is inside...for a chain.  Anyways, it seems like Cheesecake Factory is of the ""any meal is a 500 calorie meal depending on what you eat"" school of thought. Most of the options on this menu were the same unhealthy choices they normally have, just in tiny portions. Luckily they adjust the prices accordingly. And to be honest, their normal portions are way to big, so it's nice to get small plates from this menu.  I won't even go into what my meal companion had (not on the skinnylicious menu or whatever). I ordered the grilled artichoke and the beet salad. I wouldn't reccomend the beet salad--it just didn't really taste fresh, and it was a little acidic in a bad way...like the beets had been washed in soap or something. The grilled artichoke was actually really good. The dipping sauce is a nice little addition to the plate so you don't feel like you are totally eating rabbit food. I applaud the commitment to giving more options, but I find that cheesecake factory often does a lot of things but not well. I know ""dessert"" and ""skinny"" seem like they are mutually exclusive, but I would push them to develop more gluten free or vegan options for dessert (I know they can do more than a bowl of strawberries if they have 30+ cheesecakes).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=80,2.24,2.91,2.91,2.7280000000000006,2.6420000000000003

216,Chad G.,"East Weymouth, MA",65,58,98.0,4.0,2015-02-28,"""Chad's Eats"" review of The Cheesecake Factory   Cuisine: Friggin Everything ! Location: Braintree Mall  Parking: It's the mall so on the weekends and especially losing hundreds of spots to snow mountains it can suck  Decor / Ambiance: Beautiful. This is a top class chain in my mind. There are a few chains I endorse and this is one.  Greeting:  Pros even when slamming busy they have a system in place to get you seated at quickly as possible.  Menu mix:  Oh boy! When I said ""friggin everything"" in the cuisine I meant it. It is without a doubt the biggest menu you will ever see. It's a lot to take in AND they got specials on top of the endless selections. Pick any cuisine and I guarantee its  on there.  Water / Bread service: Excellent, bread is great. They give you a dark molasses type bread and a French baguette. Hard to stay away from eating it all.  Drink pour:  Don't  remember getting wine or drinks but from what I have seen at other tables it looks like a generous pour.  Food quality:  I always enjoy my food here. Food always seems to be fresh, the presentation is always neat and clean flavors are always right on. Service: These folks are pros. Very attentive.  Value: Consistent with the food quality, service and ambience  Bathrooms: Spotless  Would I return? Always do, mostly for lunch Comments & Tips:  They have great salads, one of my favorites is in the skinnylicious menu. Goes down grade after having a couple of cheeseburger sliders which are awesome. I also really like their fish tacos and when it comes to their cheesecakes it is one of the hardest decisions you'll ever make in life because they're so friggin awesome. One of my all-time favorites is the red velvet cheesecake and a pineapple upside down cheesecake and to many more to Mention and oh my God my stomach is rumbling now thinking about it",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=80,2.84,2.94,2.94,2.768,2.9

I've tried so hard to want to go back seeing as it's so convenient, but the service has been so awful each time, that for the money, we'd rather go elsewhere. The food has been delicious each and every time we go, but for some reason, we wait at least 20 minutes AFTER being seated to have just our drink order taken. By this time, we are ready to order as well except I guess that's a little too much for the staff since we don't even get our drinks until our food has almost been brought out. For me, drinks are equally as important. I am a diet coke drinker and usually go through about 2 refills. I don't think I've ever been given a refill the times we went at this location.  My point is, the food is fantastic, but the young staff that is employed at this location is very below par.

We heard happy birthday about 8 times after being seated before we got any kind of food.

Once getting to the table, I noticed right away that both of my forks were dirty with previous food crusted on.

Got the Cajun jambayalan pasta and it was pretty plain compared to say the spicy chipotle pasta I usually get. We also got the herb salmon, spicy chipotle, shepherds pie, and a cheeseburger. The salmon was pretty good, not too dry. The sauce was tangy and the asparagus was a little bitter to my taste. The design kind of looks like a claw with a bunch of fingers too so we got a laugh out of that. My friend says that it was pretty plain.  The shepherds pie was not what I had imagined. It had mashed potatoes on top with mushrooms and ground beef on the bottom with a subtle sauce. I thought it was all right when I took a bite out of it from my friend's plate.  The spicy chipotle was okay. Just like the usual which is always a plus.  The Cajun pasta had shrimp and chicken. They were both so full of moisture and not dry. The only down part was that the whole dish isn't very seasoned. It was so plain I had to add extra salt and pepper to get SOME flavor in my mouth.  SERVICE: It was really good. Our waiter was super friendly and got us a lot of bread which I personally loved. The only downside was that my friend's spicy chipotle order was wrong. But we just had to wait around 5-10 more minutes but we were all eating when his food wasn't there which wasn't enjoyable.  This is a good place to go with family and such.

I cant wait for my next cheat day!! Disclaimer: I came here 3 times within 8 days to ensure a perfect Yelp review :P Apps/Small Plates: Calamari and the Buffalo Blasts are my favorites so far. Initially, I thought the buffalo blasts were a little too salty/rich but I think they make the perfect shareable appetizer. Buffalo sauce, cheese, and chicken in a fried won-ton wrapper is actually the best thing ever. -Crispy Fried Cheese: only about $5.50, but so not worth it. Do yourself a favor and get the Fried Mac & Cheese instead. Entrees/sides: -Goat cheese & beet salad (I think its the French Country Salad) but that was the gist of it. It's pretty good. I'm trying to get myself to eat more beets, so this was an enjoyable way of doing so. It also had asparagus and candied pecans. -Fried Mac & Cheese: YUM! Need I say more?? If I had to, I'd only mention that the marinara sauce on top is so amazing. -Mac & cheese: the sharp cheddar taste was strong (if you're into that). When I had the leftovers the next day, it was extremely oily??? But once I poured out the 1/2 cup of grease, it actually tasted really good. Drinks: I had the Georgia peach (sweet & frozen), the House Merlot (very good) and The blue Long Island Iced Tea. All very good choices. Desserts: -Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake: YUM -Salted Caramel Cheesecake: DOUBLE YUM -Dutch Caramel Apple Streusel: YUMMY!! (this isn't a legit ranking. Caramel + cheesecake is always a win for me so these fun variations were amazing). There are so many other things to try!! That is what makes it a 5 star experience.

After siting there for maybe 15 minutes or even more the waiter came to take our food and drink order all at once. I had a question about the Evelyn's Favorite Pasta and if I could have it without mushrooms to which he said yes. Well over a half hour later he came back to let me know that it was in the sauce. So then I had to make another decision and went with the eggplant Parmesan. Everyone else's food came out and after I waited while everyone else ate my food finally came out. The eggplant tasted like it was covered in pepper. It was so gross I only ate my pasta. I should of just skipped eating all together as I waited long enough. I do not think I will return to this location ever again. The waiter should know the menu and if not ask the kitchen.

252,Amir S.,"Boston, MA",282,21,12.0,2.0,2016-08-18,"We planned a birthday outing for my daughter who turned 11. Ordered a Red Velvet cake for our table. For starters, we ordered the Firecracker Salmon (extremely salty this go round) and the Chicken Dumplings (too salty for everybody's taste buds). My wife ordered the Tex-Mex (her favorite), and unless you like beef, corn and whatever else goes in that, there was absolutely NO SEASONING. For the meals, I asked the server what sides came with the burger. She explained that I had the option of having regular fries, sweet potato pies or seasoned fries. I chose the seasoned fries and a medium burger. My daughter ordered the golden fried shrimp with fries. My wife ordered the Mac and Cheese Balls. Our order comes back and the fries were cold WITHOUT seasoning. I asked the server if they had any seasoned fries. She replied: ""those ARE seasoned. They're seasoned with salt."" I then asked, so what's the difference between your regular fries, your seasoned fries and your sweet potato fries? She said: ""the fries are seasoned."" I sent the plate back and I also sent back my daughter's salty dumplings. The manager brought back the ""seasoned"" fries and they were cold. I complained that it appeared they had seasoned cold fries. The server tried to convince me they wouldn't do that (while I'm staring at a cup of cold fries). Needless to say, they took the whole plate three times with the same burger on it that had now gone from medium to nearly well done somehow, but definitely cold. I changed everything and got chicken sliders. They brought them out hot, minus the cheese, and NO SEASONING WHATSOEVER. Since the place was built, my wife and I have been there countless times. This is perhaps the worst of times. I tipped the server $26 (a little over 20%) because I would hope it would be an incentive to REMEMBER A SIMPLE GLASS OF WATER next time.  After the manager gave us this history rhetoric about how the morning prep comes in and makes sure every ""ingredient"" is added to their 30-something-year specifications, we left. As always, the cheesecake was on the square. OH! The manager came back to the table and said: ""I checked and tasted the Tex-Mex, and you're right. They do not have any taste to them. But there's nothing we can do about that now, because whatever we have has been prepped for today already."" ???

Same long waits for its expansive (slightly expensive), delicious menu. But I'm rating this place since we come here more often (proximity and all) The main thing I want to say is that this place has lovely staff and very kid friendly! They were always very nice to us when we wanted to bring our baby in his car seat- either by giving us a big booth to fit him with us or helping us secure him on one of their car seat holder things they have. On a busy day, one of the walkways between the restaurant and the mall are packed with parked strollers. :) They have a delightful brunch! Good brunchy/breakfasty items AND lunch/sandwich items to choose from.  Their small plates are really great if you have a small appetite but still want tasty food. Worth the price.  Their entrees are huge and possibly can be turned into leftovers for 2-3 meals :) Their sandwiches are VERY tasty and probably some of the more affordable items on the menu- and the perfect amount. Not too big, not too small.  Their desserts: I love their strawberry short cake. I guess they have cheesecakes too. :-P Kidding- oh there are SO many to choose from and they are all divine.  Oh and the BREAD! OH THE BREAD! The honey wheat bread is for the gods and goddesses. I typically ask them to only bring out that kind instead of their sourdough. They are generally nice to accommodate. If they forget because it's busy, I don't complain. I just make my husband eat the sourdough :) It's worth the wait. Sit outside if you can. Don't hesitate to bring your little one and don't worry about leaving your stroller out of your view.

I was appalled to be sat in a 6 table cordoned off corner that represented a very badly run day care.  Food was as expected. You know what you're getting, frozen perfected, chain recipe. Fried appetizers were good because they were fried. Burger is average, eggplant Parmesan is average, chicken Madeira is very good however. I think that's one of their few staple items that remain popular. The dessert was like a top of a wedding cake you take out of your freezer a year later.   Which was surprising and disappointing. However the number 1 most mind blowing thing about this surreal experience was the check included a suggested gratuity.

Cold food Check, forgetting drinks check, waiter never checking back after food arrives check. Another visit I had was when I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken, and the dish came impossibly salty (I asked them to try it and take it back). And in our most recent and last visit our fried calamari plate came to our table looking like a mess, like it had just been dropped on the floor and quickly put back on to the plate (I knew this because the cocktail sauce was everywhere).

I didn't leave any room for cheesecake this time but I've had it there before and all varieties I've had so far have been great. I just found out there today that they're implementing this new thing where you have to ask for bread if you want it served to you. Because both myself and the table next to me hadn't been served bread yet and when we asked about it the waitress explained that the reason that the bread is no longer being served automatically is due to people with food allergies and from now on if a table wants bread they must now ask that it be served. This is a first for me because I've been there countless times in the past and have never had to ask for it. My guess is they may be trying to cut back on waste. Makes me wonder if I'll see this policy starting to trend at many of the various chains out there now.

33,Lisa G.,"Washington, DC",26,104,153.0,4.0,2017-10-10,"Came here for lunch while visiting from out of town. There was a bit of a wait for lunch but a table opened up in the bar area so we jumped on it! Our server, Eunize, was very sweet and attentive. We ordered an appetizer Caesar salad and buffalo blast to share between three. We sent back to buffalo blast because they were full of batter and tasted different than our party remembers them being months back. Taking it off the bill was not a problem which is appreciated because some places try to make you order something else. My sister ordered the chicken chipotle pasta which is her favorite, hold the peas and crunchy topping but add extra sauce. My partner and I shared the tempura fish tacos which to me were a bit over battered. Overall, a nice lunch and not bad for $44. Would come back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree,3.04,2.73,2.844,,2.854
244,Steve F.,"Boston, MA",0,23,2.0,1.0,2017-10-14,"Avoid this location, very disappointed with the service. The food was ok. First Let me say that I have been to at least half a dozen cheesecake factories across the country and have had great experiences at all of them, except this one.  I visited this location 3 times in the last 2 months. I will never go back.  First visit, terrible service. Took 20 minutes to have our server take our drink order. When we said ""can we give you the whole order now?"" She said ""no, I'll have to come back for that"". We ordered two apps ahead of our meal. But our main courses arrived WITH our apps. Same time! We expressed our dismay and the waitress said ""do you want me to take your food back and keep it warm?""  Yeah, no thanks.  So we tried at again two weeks later. Better service but once again, apps came out with our main courses. We told the waitress that this happened to us 2 weeks earlier.   She alluded that it was a common problem.  Last week we said ""let's give it one more shot"". This time we sat at the bar. It was around 9pm on a Saturday. While the drinks came quick since we were at the bar (go figure) we waited 22 minutes to get BREAD (we timed it). Put in our app and dinner order and SPECIFICALLY SAID "" can you make sure our apps come out first?"" The waiter looked confused and said ""of course"". Low and behold, 20 minutes later another waitress shows up with a big tray with our apps AND dinners. At this point I was pissed. I said ""why does this ALWAYS happen here? Do you not understand what an appetizer is?, this happens here all the time"" her response was ""really? All the time?""  With a snotty tone. I asked to speak with a manager. Nobody ever showed up. Our original waiter came back and asked ""how is everything?""  I pointed to the apps on the table with our dinners and said ""what do you think?""  He looked surprised and apologized but made no offer to correct the situation.  So I am never giving this location another dollar again. Either their training is lacking or their is zero management oversight. But to screw up the simplest of tasks in large restaurant that often is completely unacceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=40,2.88,2.72,2.836,,2.7840000000000003
36,Scott F.,"Duxbury, MA",0,3,,1.0,2017-11-04,I am not sure why there is a 2 hour wait for a table. The service is bad and food just so so.

I ordered the gumbo which was surprising delicious and my wife ordered the fried catfish plate which came with green beans, mashed potatoes, and corn as side dish. We also tried the fried chicken sliders as appetizer and they were delicious as well.

27,Mario M.,"Miami, FL",173,66,127.0,3.0,2017-11-11,"Came here after a long day of visiting stores for work and had a not so great experience. I sat at the bar and there was one couple who had just finished their meals sitting at the end. I ordered a beer (Sam adams because they didn't have Stella draft) and was asked if I wanted the delicious bread that usually comes with while you wait for the meal. I got my beer and waited for the bread. Another couple sat next to me a few minutes later, ordered their meal, and received their bread right away. I looked around to see if my bread was coming, looked at the bar tender and said; I guess I'm not getting any bread tonight. He looked at me and said he would look into it, but at that point my Louisiana Chicken Pasta dinner had already come out. I was really looking forward to drinking my beer with the bread, however that never happened. My meal was ok, but was never offered an apology for the bread, so I asked for the bartender to comp my half drank beer ( I wasn't feeling the Sam Admas). I'll probably visit a different restaurant when I visit this area the next time I'm in town due to this experience.

19,Alanna S.,"Sharon, MA",235,4,,1.0,2017-11-19,"I am very disappointed with my latest experience. I usually love Cheesecake Factory, so earlier today I went to get takeout to bring to a party I was attending later. I ordered 3 spinach and artichoke dips. It took 30 minutes for them to have it ready, which was long but understandable because they were busy. After walking out with my takeout I did check to make sure they were all there. To my dismay, it was crab dip and not the spinach dip I had ordered. I went back inside and told the worker who had given me my order that it was the wrong dip, and I really could not wait another 30 minutes to get the right order. The woman said she would give me a refund, but she needed to get a manager first. 5-10 minutes later a manager finally comes over. The worker told the manager, ""They ordered crab dip, but really wanted spinach dip so now they want a refund"". No mention that it was in fact her that actually messed up the order. The manager punched in her authorization code for the refund and walked away. No apology. The worker then told us the refund would be issued in 2 days. We walked out 45 minutes later empty handed. Not once did someone say how sorry they were for the mixup. I understand that things like this happen, but I expected some sort of apology. Instead the workers and manger were rude. I sadly do not think I will ever be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=20,2.72,2.77,2.84,,2.75
20,Julie M.,"Weymouth, MA",58,157,123.0,4.0,2017-12-04,"I just really cant get over how dark it is in this restaurant. I like intimate ambiance and all but it is just so dark you can hardly see where you're going let alone the menu.  The avocado spring rolls are out of this world. The outside is fried perfectly to give you that crunch, and then you have good chunks of avocado inside with other spices. The dipping sauce looked green in color and had a sweetness to it. I think last time i ordered them there was a creamy sauce where as this one was more of a liquid sauce. Whatever the sauce was it paired perfectly with the rolls.  I was impressed that the butter that comes with the rolls was not in packets but instead one large pad on a saucer.  The pasta carbonara with chicken, ringing up to a $20.50 price, was well over priced for the portion size you get. I normally am able to get a few meals out of the one dish but not today. The meal was delicious i cant deny that, with the exception of a few cartilage pieces in the chicken, the garlic Parmesan sauce is very flavorful over the spaghetti and i loved the peas and bacon bits. Last but not least, the cheesecake. Holy moly the Chocolate moose cheesecake is like silk in your mouth. It is so smooth and light with just the right chocolate-y-ness. So so so good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree,2.68,2.78,2.84,,2.74

21,Laura M.,"Boston, MA",9,14,3.0,1.0,2017-12-23,"We had an awful experience here last night as a large group dining for a birthday between 6:20 - 7:45pm. We had two servers assigned to our two tables. My review is for the server assigned to our table who was short in stature with brown hair (cannot remember her name). My husband ordered a filet mignon. Our sever brought him a ribeye and told him it was a filet! Yes, you read that right. Our waitress did not know the difference between a ribeye and a filet. She then quickly left before we could protest further.  The ribeye steak tasted like it was rolled in salt before it was cooked and was inedible. The mac and cheese tasted like the boxed Velveeta from our youth. My steak tacos were fine, but very small and nothing spectacular.  Ten minutes later she returns, says she was wrong and that she will give him the inedible ribeye for free. My husband rightly rejected her offer (a ribeye is a very different cut from a filet) and requested a filet. She said it would take a long time to come out, and he still said that was fine. 30 minutes later - everyone else is done eating, his filet comes out undercooked!! It was bright red throughout and not even close to medium well. I'm not sure how it took 30 minutes to undercook a steak. He sends it back.  When it returns 10 minutes later, he is so frustrated he asks for a to go box. We ask for the bill. Here's where the fun begins folks... Waitress charged us for 2 filets and only refunded 1! She said she would not refund the 2nd one because we ordered it after she said she would give us a free ribeye. First, that is not a proper accommodation. A ribeye is not a substitute for a filet. Second, we should not be paying for the restaurant's numerous mistakes regarding the type of steak and the requested preparation.  I slept on it and realized this was actually ridiculous and we should not have paid. We should have asked for a manager and pressed the issue. I am leaving this review so others are aware of the poor service we received and the subpar food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree,2.76,2.82,2.828,,2.796
26,Debra D.,"South Easton, MA",3,5,,1.0,2017-12-30,"My family of five ate here for lunch.   When we sat down there was old stevia wrapper stuck to the bottom of My plate and dirty forks ( actual stuck on food)  My shrimp and pasta came with hot pasta and STONE COLD SHRIMP).  My husbands food was Undercooked. ( he told her exactly the way he wanted it with details ). And there was a foreign substance in my edamame beans.   ( something stuck on the bean).      The manager that came over was just matter of fact and said they would be replaced.    NO CARE, concern or sympathetic comment   They remade the meals as the rest of my family ate ......  when our meals returned the second time they were hot but half way thru my pasta I found a large piece of shrimp shell.  With the leg parts still attached.    During the meal As the waitress was refilling our waters she touched the pitcher to the rim of he glass......  GROSS!   (If my mouth is on the rim to drink so is everyone else's and all transferred SPIT on the pitcher also).   No attention to PROPER HEALTH PRACTICES very unsanitary....... I am disgusted at the lack of concern, lack of attention to detail in the kitchen ( with the foreign substance and shells).   They took off my meal and my husbands but nothing can help the RUINED meal of us all eating separately and he upset of things not being correct the first time.   I can eat cold foot at home.   I wanted to have a nice meal with my family.   Well.... not here !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree,2.76,2.78,2.816,,2.772

Their menu selection is so huge; they have something for everyone! I'm pretty picky, so I love that they also offer a photo of each dish on their online menu (pro tip). Only downside is how expensive it is here, even for the more ""basic"" dishes. Don't walk in starving, expecting to be seated right away. I think every time I've come to this location there's been a decently long wait time, so just keep that in mind.
