The wait wasn't that long and they were nice enough to take back my food when I did not like it. Their menu is huge so basically I can always count of them to satisfy whatever I feel like eating at the moment. I never really order the cheesecakes though.

180,Rebecca K.,"Valrico, FL",166,117,47.0,4.0,2012-05-19,"I love the Cheesecake Factory for days when I decide to treat myself and indulge in a 3,000 calorie dinner. The fresh warm bread is always a winner. I have had slow service a couple times on very busy weekend evenings, but nothing to really complain about. The food on their 100 page menu is a plenthora of tasty items to choose from no matter what mood I am in. Although, I'm not a huge fan of their light/skinny menu and I'm sad that the past couple times I didn't see the portabella sandwich anywhere on the menu. The flavor seems to be lacking a bit on the couple of dishes I have tried from the light menu. I ordered the light lettuce wraps, but it seemed that I needed to drown the wraps in the accompanying sauces to get any burst of flavor. If you like spicy like I do - try the Black Pepper Jamaican Shrimp entree or the Sante Fe Salad from their regular menu. Portions are enough for two days of eating.  And of course the reason why most tourists or sweet tooths visit is for dessert. Tiramisu is my favorite dessert and their tiramisu cheesecake is absolutely delicious. I never want to eat all of it in one sitting so I can savor it for days, but I always end up cleaning my plate and feeling like a porker waddling out of there. The couple times I've ordered a drink, I have not been overwhelmed, but not underwhelmed either.   PS.

71,Carlos H.,"Tampa, FL",3386,793,1522.0,5.0,2012-06-26,"My family and I are Cheesecake Factory regulars. I think I have been to this location over 100 times since I moved to Brandon back in 2005. The service here has always been great, much better than the other location at the International Plaza where the waiters are schizo. It's the place where my nephew tried his first cheeseburger when he was a toddler, birthday parties, and numerous other events have occurred here, it is filled with memories. I love most things on the menu. The avocado eggroll sliders and tuna tartare are my favorite appetizers. I previously ate their burgers regularly, but have found them to be a little too salty in the last few years. The caramel chicken is an awesome choice and is inspired by Vietnamese cuisine with just a touch of spiciness. The four cheese pasta is always great. Their factory burrito grande is no joke, never order it alone unless you plan to box it. Brunch at Cheesecake Factory is always a great thing as well. The factory huevos rancheros are awesome. Like I said before, I will eat almost anything on the love Cheesecake Factory menu. Is it healthy? No. Is it tasty? Yes. The portions are huge, so it isn't a bad idea to share them and then also save on price as well. Finally who can leave the Cheesecake Factory without a waiter or waitress suggested you take some cheesecake home? My favorite cheesecake choices are the fresh banana cream cheesecake and Godiva chocolate cheesecake. Delicious. The bartender always makes great drinks as well and despite the huge crowd, you still get seated in a reasonable manner.  The Cheesecake Factory may be a chain, but it is one of my favorite chains.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brandon?start=80,3.3800000000000003,3.3800000000000003,3.3800000000000003,3.3800000000000003,3.380000000000001

66,Crystal H.,"St Petersburg, FL",437,436,1512.0,5.0,2012-11-13,"We recently had dinner at the bar at this Cheesecake Factory and I must say it was one of the most pleasant dining situations we have had recently. Our Bartender/ Server Ronnie was on the ball. He had drinks in front of us before we had really even settled into our seats and he kept them full. We like to eat at the bar because it is typically more private than some of the tables, you get a t.v. and you have the bartender (who rarely leaves the area directly in front of you) to wait on you.  We ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and Stuffed Chicken Tortillas for our entrees. They were both extremely delicious. The Stuffed Chicken Tortillas came with 2 delicious corn cakes (sort of like spoon cornbread formed into cakes) that I could not get enough of. The meal had a green sauce that is a little different from what I would traditionally eat (aka red sauce), but it worked out nicely. The Louisiana Chicken Pasta was my Husbands. It is bow-tie pasta covered in a creamy and slightly spicy sauce with fried pounded chicken on top.  We grabbed dessert to go and we were out of the restaurant in less than 40 minutes. Fast, delicious and we had leftovers. Winning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brandon?start=80,4.2,4.2,4.2,3.4760000000000004,4.2

201,Francesco C.,"Sarasota, FL",2046,176,345.0,4.0,2013-01-21,"Coming to a popular American Icon, I promised myself not to be too critical to a place in which the name of the business describes as to sell, just multiple variety of ""cheese cakes."" However, when I walked up to the restaurant, I was already in awe with the colorful and fancy outdoor decor and art deco type of building.  So my curiosity had increased to try something new.  Walking in I noticed the long line just to add in their names in a large service book and in hope to be called soon.  While waiting I took a menu and glanced through it to find 6 full pages (12 counting both sides) of food items and only one and a half of cheese cake pictures and variety with their description.  Now, I was stuck to chose.  I had no idea it would have so much to gander.  When I was finally called and sat in a square table, I ordered a sweet drink, the Raspberry Lemonade, my girl friend ordered a Mint Tea.  Soon after they brought out our drinks, warm white bread and pumpernickel bread with butter was given while trying to decide.  Of course, I had to try to convince my 115 lb friend not to read from the ""SkinnyLicious"" menu and actually get some grub.! Finally and surprisingly she agreed and decided on a ""Chicken Piccata"" and I order also from the chicken coup, I ordered a ""Crusted Chicken Romano."" Crusted Chicken Romano was great to the taste, chicken was cut like fillets and tender and breaded nicely, although this was a lunch date, the portion was perfect in size.  Came with Angel Hair pasta with marinara sauce.  On her plate, I found it a little better tasting with creamy lemon sauce dressed with mushrooms and capers, had plenty of shrooms on top and her cut was similar to mine and very tender. Hers also came with angel hair pasta in the same mushrooms lemon sauce sauce.  Food was good!  Finally we ordered the sinner!  A huge piece of Oreo Cheesecake!!  Wow!  Rich and more rich, but great tasting and it marbleized my stomach!  I love this place!

I recently went to the Brandon location this past Saturday with my parents. for my birthdayI've been to CF in Chicago at the base of the John Hancock building before, and besides the structure itself, the food , service, ambiance were similar. CF could be accused of having a Dissociative Identity Disorder since their entrees range from pastas, chops, seafood, pizza, sandwiches..etc IMO, most of the dishes seem to be covered well. I ordered my staple, the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and a mojito.  The mojito was cool , crisp, and great. The pasta was nice and spicy, shrimp fresh, and as is the course with CF, enough for 2 meals. My parents were surprised because they thought it was primarily a dessert place, but were shocked at the dizzying amount of entrees. For dessert, I ordered the Caramel Pecan turtle cheesecake. It was awesome, but cheesecake in any flavor was awesome.  Service was good and the servers decorated the cake plate with ""Happy Birthday"" in syrup and sang which was nice.

We had not received the complimentary bread that is usually served once you are seated so we had to ask for the bread to be brought out also the plates they set on the table for bread and appetizers mine was dirty it had some kind of sauce smeared on the top and a glob of sauce on the underneath of the plate. We got the Thai lettuce wraps which are always very good and they did not disappoint today. We each got a salad I got the Cobb salad and it was fantastic and my wife got the French country salad and she said hers was good as well.

I'm going to guess that this location fairly busy all of the time, as it is located in the mall and during both of my visits there was a wait. Thankfully during this visit, we were there strictly for cheesecake so seating in the bar was appropriate. I'm not sure if this is true to all locations, but at this one, you are able to seat yourself in the bar area. They are also full service in the bar so just an FYI for those who don't like to wait :) Our waiter came to take our orders shortly after we sat down and he was very nice and patient. I was with a friend who was slightly indecisive and had several questions about the different cheesecakes that they offer. Our waiter was very well versed in the cheesecake menu and made great recommendations for all of us. We were all very pleased with our choices.  Each time I visit the Cheesecake Factory, I try to order a different flavor cheesecake. On this visit I chose to try the pineapple upside-down cheesecake. Now I've often shied away from this one because when I want cheesecake, I really WANT cheesecake and this particular cake has 2 layers of pineapple cake with pineapple cheesecake in between. BUT I am SO glad that I opted to try this one because it was soooooooooooo delicious! I was extremely pleased with it.  Now, if you've never had a piece of cheesecake from The Cheesecake Factory, please know that this isn't your typical thin, petite, restaurant portion of desert. These portions are huge and easily enough to be shared by 2 or 3. If you just want a little taste, make sure you plan to share. One of my friends opted for the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake which had a lighter flavor than the pineapple upside down but was very tasty as well. The other chose the red velvet cheesecake which is extremely rich and sweet. I've had this one before as well and it's an awesome choice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brandon?start=60,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.248,3.76

We arrived at 6 PM and we were informed that it would be an hour and a half wait. The hostess asked us to leave the restaurant and walk around and return in an hour for a pager. She took my cell phone number, and said she would call if she couldn't find us. Half of the party went shopping and the rest waited in the restaurant. At 6:43, she called my cell phone, but I didn't have a signal in the mall. At 6:45 my mother requested the pager and the hostess didn't mention she had just called us. The shopping group returned at 7 and sat waiting with the rest of the party. My brother-in-law asked the hostess about the wait time at 7:30 and he was informed that she had already called us and it would be another 20 minutes. I spoke with the manager who said he would seat us, but nothing happened. We were finally paged at 7:45 and seated. Everyone had good food, except for my sausage and ricotta flatbread, which had burnt sausage on it and it wasn't sliced. By this time, I felt it was useless to complain.

All 4 of us had something different but we started out with the garlic cheese bread that came with a yummy oil mixture and a red sauce. Delicious!!! I had the small Cobb salad which was massive yo say the least. Could have fed a family of 4. One person had the bacon cheeseburger which he said was delicious and piled high with bacon. Another had a quesadilla which was big as well.  To end the meal 2 got cheesecake of course. White chocolate raspberry and Godiva chocolate.

I would assume, given the name, that their specialty is (every type imaginable of) cheesecake, for which there is also an abundance of options...unfortunately I have never tried any of them. Today we had the nachos appetizer, and I stopped at that because 1) the plate was rather large for two people, and 2) I still could not make up my mind. The nachos weren't bad.

42,Ariel T.,"Tampa, FL",91,134,788.0,2.0,2016-01-23,"**Review is based off of To-Go Experience** I have frequented this Cheesecake Factory's location plenty of times, however I should note I rarely order anything to go from this establishment. Every time I have visited, it is usually for a sit down meal. All of the meals were I have sat down, or have even ordered from the bar have highly surpassed the level of poor service that I received from their carry out service last night. To be quite honest, I'm highly disappointed.  Especially because I spent $40 on to-go food, which to me as a college student isn't cheap by any means.  But alas, I'm highly in love with the Cheesecake Factory's guacamole, the amazing salads, and the addictive appetizers. So, I thought it would be a good idea to order myself some to go and watch a movie in the comfort of my own home. So I did what any would, I ordered ahead while I was at my house, and then proceeded to drive to Brandon to pick my food up. Well, 45 minutes later in the parking there I was-foodless, hangry, and calling them wondering what happened to my order. I was over it. Waiting out in the cold and wind forever, was definitely not Netflix and chilling like I'd intended. I was wondering why the heck everything took an eternity to prepare. I'd just ordered guacamole, Luau salad, and buffalo chicken blasts. Two things that are cold, and a fried appetizer should never take that long! I will return, only because I love the service I get in the restaurant. However, I will definitely remember this horrible moment and never order anything to-go from this location again.

We were quoted an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes. After waiting our allotted time, we asked the hostess how much longer. She told us about 15 minutes. I was annoyed but we had already waited that long so what would 15 more minutes be. After 30 minutes went by, I asked to speak with a manager. The manager (Justin Fletcher) came and said it would be another 15 minutes. I asked him to explain why it was taking so long to get us seated and he stated there were 2 spots in the restaurant that he could put us but they were waiting on tables to leave before they sat us. I then asked why this was not communicated to us after we waited the hour and fifteen minutes, to this he had no answer. I said to him that we had already waited 2 hours and by the time our dinner would arrive to our table it would have been 3 hours that we hadn't eaten. To this his response was ""well we do have to cook the food."" That was the most disrespectful comment. It was then that I told him the party would not be eating here and asked for his name. At first he was reluctant to give it but once I informed him I would be contacting the corporate office he gave his name and this is when he offered to buy our party appetizers. I said no thank you we are done. Never was there an apology given.

We generally share the guacamole and chips which is always fresh and you can make it spicy if you like. The drink specials are pretty good too, I usually get whatever craft brew they have on tap.

As with most chain restaurants, a few details slide through the cracks, but mostly the Factory hits the mark. The staff is friendly, punctual and always ready to refill a water glass or sprinkle some Parmesan. We had two courses for our dinner, an appetizer and two entrees.  The appetizer was an interesting blend of West Coast healthy eating and Asian finger food: Avocado Spring rolls. I can say that they tasted like well-made guacamole (onions, tomatoes, the works) while their presentation (cut in half diagonally and served on a bed of crispy rice noodles) certainly put me in the mood to chow down. Can definitely recommend. For entrees, I had the Pasta Carbonara with chicken  while my friend had the Factory Chopped Salad. The pasta had a creamy, rich garlic Parmesan sauce that, I think, dried out into a thin glaze over the course of my meal. Overall, both it and the chicken were quite good, but nothing stellar.  I only had a few bites of the salad, but I can say it was a delectable menagerie of all sorts of flavors and textures: tomatoes, cucumbers, corn, bacon, bleu cheese and apple just to name a few. I can definitely recommend that dish. One issue left a little more to be desired: the silverware was very poorly washed. My knife had marks all up the blade and the rest of the silverware was only a little better.

Now, when I finally got my table I was seated in an area that was uncleaned and as noisy as hell. I finally ordered my drink and after that when the bread came, THE WAS NO SOUR DOUGH BREAD! I was really looking forward to trying it but they only had wheat bread which paired with butter is pretty good. So when I got my spaghetti and meatballs, the pasta and the meatballs as a whole were pretty good except for the fact that the meatballs where kind of overcooked on a few sides but that wasn't really a problem. So for the food itself, it was actually pretty decent and the Oreo cheesecake i had was very good! However the atmosphere there is really the pits.

CF knocked it out of the park! They took care to present the food well and not just throw it in the container in a haphazard way. Presentation is key to set up the mind for a good bite and I cannot say enough how impressed we were. We ordered the meat loaf and bang-bang chicken and shrimp along with adam's peanut butter cheesecake and the new coffee cheesecake.  The entrees were delicious and a large portion neither of us could finish. The cheesecakes were fantastic and the packaging was impressive to have a texture on the bottom so it doesn't slide when eating it (I hate when things slide around in a take out dish!) For curb-side the order was ready in 20 minutes on a Saturday night during dinner rush. I pulled up and called the number on the sign. Food was ready and hot. Service was great! I know, I know how good can it be at my car? The waitress did little things that matter. Letting me know things were hot and to be mindful how close input the cheesecake to it, reminding me to take my cc once I signed the check and had some small talk.
