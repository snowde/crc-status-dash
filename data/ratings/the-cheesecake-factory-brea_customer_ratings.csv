674,Liz H.,"Irvine, CA",15,167,22.0,4.0,2012-01-13,"My girlfriend and I eat here constantly because it's the halfway meet-up point between us.  We have found over the course of multiple visits that the enormous menu is hit-and-miss. We've found a handful of dishes that we enjoy and just order those over and over. Her favorite is the Orange Chicken, which always comes out hot and delicious and with just the right amount of rice. I prefer the Barbecue Chicken Salad. Their pasta dishes are generally very tasty, but if you order anything with chicken or shrimp in it they seriously skimp on it. The only thing I've ever ordered at CF that I could not finish eating because it was so disgusting was the Chicken di Pana. It tasted like feet. Avoid it. The service is generally very polite and friendly, if at times a little slow. We usually don't notice unless our drinks get exceptionally low and nobody comes to refill them. My friend loves their strawberry lemonade and I am very fond of their good strong Mojitos.  Their desserts are delicious, naturally. To be honest I've never bothered with the cheesecake, I love the Black-Out cake and the Bowl of Fresh Strawberries option.

When i first tried this place, they used to be better for some reason. I always order strawberry lemonade and it just go way too sweet like few months ago and it didn't change till the last visit.  Their portions are mind boggling large at dinner time and just right when you order lunch portion. I recommend spicy chicken chipotle pasta and Fettucini with chicken and sun dried tomatoes and garlic noodles. I've also tried Evelyn's favorite pasta and it was meh.. something that you could make at home! They give you white and brown oatmeal bread before the main food. But lately i discovered that they only give you brown bread now! Or was that just me..? i don't think so because i saw so many bread coming in and out only with those brown bread in the basket. Well but i guess that's pretty reasonable because brown bread was the most popular bread and people always asked for that over and over again.  Their service is very good. Never caught a day when they were mean or inattentive!  Just my favorite place to eat for decent price! I can't really say anything about dessert menu because i get stuffed when i finish eating pastas.. But I've tried original cheesecake and obviously the best because it says in their sign board..

M.,"Orange County, CA",4,208,1.0,2.0,2012-01-31,"A tough review because I like the chain and have found the food options plentiful and wait staff pleasant.  At all other locations -- and then there's Brea, and the below is not the first example of inattentive service at this location. Hello, Bartender, over here, please.  Don't act like you don't see me sitting here at your bar.  You know, I'm the dude with the empty beer glass that has been empty for, oh, I don't know, 10 minutes?!?  Right, just look right through me and my empty glass and just stare up at the ceiling, because that's where you'll find bar patrons wanting to order some food and a drink before heading home.  The thirsty, hungry types always hang out on the ceiling.   Better than that, a shift change at 5:00 PM during Happy Hour that ends at 6:00 PM?  Perfect scheduling, because Bartender A who has a shift ending isn't taking orders but instead cleaning bar glasses so she can end her shift vs. Bartender B who stares at the ceiling like he can't be bothered serving patrons really is a smart management decision and great way to handle customers willing to part with money for food and drink. While my glass still sits empty I devise a quick plan to ensure I don't interfere with the flow of this bar:  Me, money, and willingness to part with some cash, perform a magic trick that should surprise no one:  I paid for my beer (with tip) and left leaving behind others still sitting with empty glasses.  Before heading home, hunger and money still in tow, I spent some money at another local chain being served by a bartender that interacted and smiled and brought food and beverage.

499,Mark E.,"Whittier, CA",50,26,,5.0,2012-03-11,"One of my best friends (who's a girl) and I went out for some dinner at this location last night and we were pleasantly surprised! Pros: Great food, excellent wine selection, classy and upbeat ambiance, excellent service with a server who took a joke and gave a few witty jokes too. Cons: The price of drinks and the dim lighting outside. Notes: The wait was a con as well but it was a Saturday night at 7-8pm. I didn't expect it to be slow at all. The pro though was we wasted 45min walking around the mall across the way. I had fresh grilled salmon with large, juicy asparagus and a large mound of mashed red potatoes. The salmon was cooked well and wasn't crunchy, the asparagus wasn't over cooked and was perfect with the potatoes. They had some Georgia Peach drink that was addicting and tasty, couldn't get enough of the peach flavor. The server was very kind funny and made the night enjoyable and the experience that much better. It almost felt like I was on a date with how smooth things were going. The only advise I'd give the restaurant is to make the outside a little more brighter. It's kinda hard to see the menus without good lighting!   It'd been 7 years since I came to this restaurant, all those years were wasted but now I know better.

385,Heather B.,"Carson, CA",94,41,7.0,3.0,2012-03-27,"This place has its potential to be better.. First of all, it is bad mistake to go during the weekend around dinner time because a lot of hugnry people who just finished shopping at Brea Mall don't want to have dinner at the food court. I don't think they take reservation on the weekend and only take walk-ins.. So if you go around 6 or 7 pm on a Saturday, you'll see at least twenty people waiting to be seated. If, after 40+ minutes of waiting, you are seated and have ordered, it'll take another 20 minutes to be served. I feel like the food tastes better during the weekdays... Probably because they don't have to rush.. I ordered what I always order, Farfalle with garlic sauce, and the pasta was undercooked. I didn't even bother asking for another one because I knew I'd have to wait some more. Another thing is that it's really loud... and dark!! It was hard to have converstation :( The cheesecakes are always delicious~ I tried the lemon raspberry for the first time.

Pauls Place's Mushroom Burger ($5) is WAY better than what they feel the need to charge $12.95 for. I REALLY don't think an 8oz glass of Apple Martini is worth $11.

It started when we sat and our utensils looked a bit dirty; however I just cleaned it with my napkin and didn't really think much of it. Things went well as our waiter gave us our bread; however after I used my knife to put butter on my bread and eat it, I realized that my spoon had remnants of chocolate stuck to it, Giving them the benefit of the doubt, I just assumed that they may have missed washing it and that only the spoon was used. So I asked my girlfriend about her utensils and her spoon had dried chocolate stains on her spoon and other marks on the rest of her utensils, which makes me really believe that these were used by someone before us. Realizing this after already using my knive and fork, I lost my appetite and spoke to the manager. Atleast the manager was really nice and said that we did not have to pay for the meal which we did not eat because of our lost appetite. The only reason I gave this place a 2 star was because the staff was friendly and the manager was nice. I would NOT return to this Cheesecake Factory. I never had a problem like this anywhere I have eaten in my life. I expected a slightly upper tier restaurant like this would never have this sort of problem; however I was wrong.

The Lunch Pasta I ordered was the Pasta Carbonara and it was delicious.  I totally enjoyed each bacon filled mouth full of pasta.  But I know my heart wasn't too happy because this pasta was loaded and was just a hearty slop of goodness.  They used a thin noodle pasta almost angel hair pasta.  The pasta had an oil based sauce that was rich in flavor and wasn't creamy.  So when you look at the pasta it looks deceiving because it looks light.  But once you stir the pasta a bit you start seeing all the goodness that was at the bottom start to mix and all the bacon dancing the tango on your plate. I am still not a big fan of Cheesecake Factory because of the usual wait you would encounter especially during weekend dinners.  But going here for lunch on a weekday was pretty painless.  We waited no more than 5 mins before our group of 6 was seated.

The menu is huge and I know I have tried a few different things that I have enjoyed. I never really choose to come here on my own, as I would rather try new places than continue to frequent this chain. On Saturday we were in Brea and wanted breakfast. I remembered having a good breakfast here a couple years ago so I suggested we come here. Well, they do have breakfast, but a limited menu. It looks like Sunday is the day to go, because that menu was much bigger and had better options. BF ordered the Brioche Breakfast Sandwich which was eggs, bacon, ham, tomato, cheese and mayo on a Brioche Roll. It was pretty good, I should have ordered that. I got the Sunrise Fiesta Burrito (the waiter said was a very good choice) which is a massive burrito filled with eggs, chicken chorizo, potatoes, peppers and onions. It is topped with salsa, an avocado and tomatillo cream sauce, and cilantro. When they brought the burrito they also gave me a separate plate with black beans on it. For this burrito having so many ingredients that sound awesome, the flavor just wasn't there for me. I ate about half of it and I only saw a couple pieces of chorizo (which wasn't spicy at all) and there were way more potatoes than eggs. The black beans on the side were kind of weird to me, so I tossed some on the plate and mixed it up with the burrito. I don't know, it just didn't do it for me.  Breakfast, with an iced tea and a Mocha Milkshake, was $40. Ehhh, this seemed more like a $20 breakfast to me, but again, this place is overpriced.

When our meals came some of our steak pieces were way over well done and if I had to compare it to something it would be as if you were attempting to saw through a block of cardboard. Shortly after the waitress took our plates to replace them, the manager came out and made the comment that they cut into all of our steak pieces and only 35% was over done but (at this point he rolled his eyes at us) they were going to replace it anyways. If he was replacing our meals anyways was it necessary to roll his eyes at us and make a snide comment about how only 35% of our steak were way past well done? As far as I'm concerned if you order steak in a restaurant and your steak is near cardboard status it needs to be replaced.

The best thing was the mashed potato which is pretty sad considering it was supposed to be steamed...

The namesake section is a tiny little section near the front entrance that most people just stare at while waiting to get seated.  For a place called cheesecake factory, I'd probably support more of a cheesecake theme mixed into all their dishes somehow.  Like if they took that cheesecake and turned it into a smoothie drink. Anyhooo, got a Meatloaf dish with mashed potatoes and a corn/squash hash sorta side.  The meatloaf was astoundingly bone dry and I didn't want to ask to send it back because it took a really long time to get so I just asked for several sides of gravy to douse the meatloaf with.  In addition the mashed potatoes while plentiful was provided with like 3 spoonfuls of gravy.  I ran out of gravy in no time and had a whole mound of gravyless mashed potatoes, so again, asked for more gravy.  Might as well give me a pitcher if I need to properly balance the sauce/food myself. The worst thing about being seated in a corner is that other servers won't walk by so if your server disappears for prolonged periods or comes to the area but serves the table behind you and next to you and doesn't even glance at yours and leaves, then you are SOL.  I do prefer high traffic seating just because the likelihood of your server being less than attentive is decent so if someone else can help you, you flag them down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=580,3.2,3.39,3.39,2.6000000000000005,3.314

Both the steak and the salmon were good but it didn't really stand out. Just a warning, the portions are HUGE! If I would have known, I would have just asked my boyfriend to share the dish with me.

I was a little hesitant to have this holiday get together at Cheesecake Factory because I know it can get busy. It was difficult because it was a big party and during the holiday season. I was quoted a wait time of 45 minutes. My party and I patiently waited. When the time reached closer for us to get our table we were told that it was going to be about 10 minutes more; however, the manager made a mistake. He quickly came over and apologized for telling us that it was sooner than he thought. He came to us twice to give us an update on our table. He could have not told us anything and make us wait longer. He personally walked us to our table and gave us some free appetizers for waiting. There was a table next to us that opened up as soon as we sat down and the manager insisted that we spread out more and brought the table closer to us. It was great. The chef came out and brought out our appetizers and even checked on us during our meal to make sure everything was tasty. The manager also checked up on us during our meal. I will definitely visit this location again and no longer be hesitant about planning dinners for large parties at the Brea location.

I've always had a pleasant experience with cheesecake factory because the way they compensate their customers when they're lagging is amazing! Last time i was in a rush to get to a movie and i put in a rush order, but it took so long for my pizza to come that i had to request it to go. Turns out that they had burnt my pizza and was in the process of making a new one, so the manager came by and gave me a free slice of cheesecake of my choice for dessert and the waitress to show her apologies gave me and my two friends free sodas to go on the house!

They always bring yummy bread to start off with, white one and some other wheat one. I love the wheat one better, there's so much more flavor. We started off with the chicken croquetes, they were pretty good. A little greasy for my liking. They're very similar to chicken empanadas except these are deep fried instead of baked.  For the entree, we split a chicken madeira (as usual) best way to eat asparagus! grilled and topped in yummy madeira wine sauce. The chicken has melted cheese on top! By the time we were done eating, we had no room for dessert. I took a piece of the dulce de leche cheesecake and I wanted to eat it on the way home but I didn't.

There's 3 things you notice immediately about the restaurant. VARIETY, GINORMOUS PORTIONS, and of course, CHEESECAKE. Some people talk mad smack about this restaurant chain but I can't say that I remember having a bad experience unless the wait was too long. That usually happens in Marina Del Rey, Redondo Beach, or Newport Beach.  Maybe, it's because these locations are more touristy than the others or cause it's an upscale neighborhood. Whatever the reasons are, I enjoy the restaurant as well as their decently stocked bar. Recently, I also visited the Grand Lux Cafe in Las Vegas and got this weird feeling of deja-vu. They're sister restaurants from the same company, but that's another day, another review. Here's what gets my taste buds going when I visit the Brea location. @ Bread - wheat, white, and don't be shy about the butter. @ Boston House Salad - Boston lettuce, chopped bacon, egg, blue cheese, croutons, tomato, and of course, RANCH dressing. Basically, it's a cobb salad and sometimes I add chicken. @ Chicken Madeira - Sauteed chicken breast, asparagus, melted mozzarella cheese, covered with mushrooms and madeira sauce, and mashed potatoes. I soak the white bread into the madeira sauce and drag it around the plate. I've tried other versions of the Chicken Madeira at different restaurants and it just doesn't compare. @ Bistro Shrimp Pasta - Crispy battered shrimp, mushrooms, tomato and arugula, tossed with spaghettini and basil garlic lemon cream sauce. I smother the dish with tabasco sauce. YUM! @ Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon - Salmon with lemon sauce, asparagus, and mashed potatoes. Simple, clean, and my choice before a night of drinking debauchery. This dish just digests well for me cause it's not heavy or oily. @ Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake - How can you turn down this classic dessert? They're starting to promote this SkinnyLicious Menu with dishes that have fewer calories, but with the same familiar taste and I just disagree with that. I'd rather order something on the original menu and then work my ass a little harder at the gym. Save your calories elsewhere, cause I really don't get the point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=520,3.16,3.25,3.364,3.024,3.214

We have been to this Brea location twice this year for dinner.  Parking has not been a problem.  I do not believe they currently have valet parking.  We have not had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table which is great!  At other locations, the wait is normally 30 minutes or longer for dinner.  The service was terrific during our first visit.  The last visit, the service was not as good.  During that last visit, I believe our server was new so I'll give her a pass for taking so long with taking our orders and helping us.  That is the reason that I'm not giving them 5 stars though. The food is delicious, and they give generous portions.  We always have leftovers good for one or two meals afterwards.  The entree prices are pricey, but the portions help make up for it.  There are many different choices on the menu so you are sure to find something you like.  I have not found anything bad yet. Make sure to save room for dessert!!  That's the reason I always have leftovers is because I save room for the cheesecake!!  Going to Costco and buying their cheesecake at the frozen section is just not nearly as good as getting the cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory itself.  My current favorites are the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut cheesecake, the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake, Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel cheesecake, and the Caramel Pecan Turtle cheesecake.  I just wish they weren't so expensive!! If you just want to buy a slice of cheesecake, then you can buy it at the front when you walk into the restaurant.  They have a counter and display there.  The display showcases many of their cheesecakes and other desserts.  The display of cheesecakes is the most beautiful attraction in the restaurant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=420,3.36,3.28,3.372,3.024,3.3120000000000003

330,Jenn L.,"Chino Hills, CA",3,22,,4.0,2013-06-19,"I've only really had a few of the same things from here but that's because they never fail to disappoint me. Beginning with the wait - depending on when you arrive the wait can range from being seated right away to an hour for a party of two. They don't allow you to call ahead to be placed on the list nor do they allow reservations. Weekend dinner time is usually the most packed.  The complimentary bread - they give each table three rolls (usually two wheat, one sourdough). The wheat bread is by far better than the sourdough, in my opinion but I will still eat the sourdough. They come with butter as well.  Stuffed mushrooms - pretty basic. Six mushrooms stuffed with herbs. They're simple but we order them almost every time. They're fairly reasonable for $3 worth if I remember correctly.  Buffalo wings - we usually get mild. Maybe it's because I'm not a huge fan but I don't really like them. My boyfriend loves them so it's not that they're bad it's just like I can't seem to acquire a taste for them. And they're about $9 so pretty pricey for buffalo wings to me.  Side of fries - completely random but there's just something about their fries that have us ordering them with our pastas every time.  Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta - the one and only dish I order here. It's honestly not that spicy and I love that they include yellow and red peppers along with asparagus. Their chicken is pretty good but if possible try asking to replace the chicken with the Louisiana chicken (it's kind of like fried chicken) but it's not overwhelmingly huge. The lunch portion is well worth getting if you're not too hungry but I usually opt for the regular.  Jambalaya - my boyfriend always gets it with pasta (you can get the option of rice instead). The chicken is always more tender than the chicken in my pasta so I like to steal his. The shrimp is cooked just as well as the chicken. During the past few visits, though, we've noticed that there isn't enough sauce so we've had to ask for more on the side. They're usually nice about it do don't hesitate if you feel like you need more sauce. This is definitely a must try.  The Cheesecakes - I've only had the Tiramisu and Original and I will definitely pick the original all the time. I felt the tiramisu was too sweet and basically full of cream. It didn't taste like a cheesecake, it just tasted like foamy sweetness. The original did not disappoint. It was perfectly creamy with just the right amount of crust. It's always hard to order a piece of cheesecake considering their pastas are pretty large in portion but the cheesecake is definitely worth trying!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=580,3.4,3.35,3.388,3.056,3.37
460,Nicole A.,"Irvine, CA",377,6,225.0,1.0,2013-06-25,"This place blows. Seriously the worst service. I came here with 5 friends for dinner a few months ago on a weekday. Our waiter looked like he was around our age and had an attitude problem. It took almost an HOUR for us to get our food (I don't think it takes an hour to prep and make a couple orders of salads, pastas, burgers and fries, thanks). A table that came after us got served before us and by the time they were paying the bill, we were still waiting for our orders to be brought to our table & served. -__-   When I FINALLY took a bite into my burger, I realized it was cold and nearly spit it out. The fries were soggy. I would have been better off going to McDonald's and getting a Big Mac and fries, and would have been more satisfied.  When I tried food from other peoples' plates, I found the food to be disappointingly bland and just ""meh"". They should stop charging top dollar for subpar quality food, or maybe put the money they make from their overpriced food towards better training their servers to be more competent and less douchey. I would rather eat TV dinner or high school cafeteria food than consume anything from here ever again.

566,Leilani B.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,2.0,2013-07-07,"Bottom Line: Other Cheesecake Factories are better than this one. I came here last night with some friends; hoping to experience the same A-plus service I have received from the many other CFs I've been to before. We were seated after maybe 15 minutes of waiting, which was a big plus for us since it was a Saturday night! One star for that! This CF is one of the most beautiful I have ever been to! They have gorgeous high ceilings, and cheesy yet cute paintings and props. Though the Egyptian theme is a little hokey, people like me love when restaurants make you feel like you're in another world -- one star for that! Once we got to our booth though, we were surprised at how rock hard the cushions were! Seriously? This CF seems pretty new, how on earth could their booths be that worn out?! It seriously felt like we were just sitting on a wooden bench all night. One star off for that, you want your guests comfortable -- right? Now, our server. She was, um, friendly I guess. I don't even know what her name was because I don't think she told us. She didn't offer to answer any questions about the menu, which totally sucked because we all were a little overwhelmed with the options. Sadly though, due to the fact that she disappeared for like 20 minutes, when she did come back to take our order, we just wanted to put our order in before we ended up spending all whole evening there. When we finally got our food she didn't check up on us until we were done; which sucked because my friend needed some ranch for her fries, but eventually gave up on her request after spending 10 minutes looking for our waitress. What also bothered me was the fact that when it came to dessert time, the waitress just dropped one menu at the table and then walked away. Hello? There were five of us seated; wouldn't it be considerate to at least bring enough menus to go around the table? Oh, well, maybe this CF just doesn't train their employees to be like most other restaurants in this chain. One star off for that, I would at least want good service, because that's what this chain claims to be all about. And now the food, I ordered the chicken medeira. It was delicious as usual, until I got to the asparagus. I took one bite of it expecting the usual savory flavor, but no, not this time. After one bite of the asparagus I nearly gagged, it tasted so sour! I have never had asparagus taste that way before, so since I was concerned about how old it was, I just skipped on it all together and left it to the side of the plate. One star off for that, all restaurants should ensure that the food they cook is fresh. All-in-all, this place is a lame Cheesecake Factory. I would not recommend going to this location. If you like bad service and spoiled food though, this place was made for you!

Our group consisted of 8 people - relatively a manageable size I presume.  Service: Our server was definitely on something - we are still figuring that out. He completely creeped us out, but aside from that... really ""how many times do we need to ask for lemons?"" We asked for lemons for our water when we placed our drink order (ordered cocktail + water w/ lemon). To make a loooooong story short we asked him whenever he walked by (not that many times) & finally politely asked 2 other servers - very sweet lady who was always smiling brought them half way thru our meal. We should've initially asked her.  It took ""messed up hair spike here & there guy"" close to an hr to take our order & this is bc we kept asking & he would in return say, ""I'll be back give me a couple of minutes."" What really got him to FINALLY take our order was... My friends flowers were sitting there in the heat so one of the girls put them in the water cup. He saw this and freaked out... He lectured her & touched the bouquet saying it could spill nevertheless it fell right after he touched it. He went off on her (leaving us speechless in shock), he wiped spilled water off with my sisters dinner napkin & LEFT IT THERE ALL NIGHT. Then proceeded to say, ""Ugh... I'll just take your order now."" FINALLY!!!  Never did this guy check on us, he completely looked out of it & easily snapped. A whole cheese cake was purchased & he brought us HOT plates. When asked for a box for the cake - he came & left it on a chair. I mean he really went out of his way to make us not want to tip him - too bad gratuity was included.

My appetite has been shrinking a bit so it may be good to try family style next time you're there (unless you really want to bring back appetizers). I ordered the fish burger which actually tasted like a better version of the filet-o-fish. Since they have a huge mound of coleslaw in the burger, I opted for fries with my dish.

If you're starving and want a decent pasta or burger, this place is awesome. The smokehouse burger is sooo good, though the fries suck. The Louisiana chicken pasta is always good here! I've been to other locations and it's either too oily or too bland. This place makes it with just enough cream and flavor. The service here is generally pretty good too. And hello! The squaw bread (brown bread) is to die for! This location is also a lot bigger and nicer than some other ones (like the Katella one).  So why 3.5 instead of 4 stars?

However, there are just some things that Cheesecake Factory does not do well... and that would include Bloody Mary's. We each ordered Bloody Mary's and they just simply were very depressingly bland. They tasted watered-down, with only a stick of celery for gnashing, the only spice it seems was the ""salt"" around the rim of the glass. Terribly disappointing! and not that we were looking for a buzz per se, on a Saturday afternoon following a couple hours of holiday shopping, but I'm fairly certain there wasn't any vodka in our glass.  Thankfully lunch made up for our bad drinks. Normally trying to find something to order at Cheesecake Factory takes me ages because the menu is ridiculously large and cumbersome. Its pages long, with way too many meals and styles and options listed. But after this visit, I'm sure I've found my new go-to meal, as it was SO INCREDIBLY GOOD::  the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp! A little mango salsa, black beans & rice, fried plantains! O-M-G this is it! I've discovered the best thing on the menu! The small-sized shrimp were spicy and tender, the mango salsa very mild. It provided the perfect blend of flavors a bit lighter in taste than typical Cuban food, although similar set up.  Our waitress was super friendly and provided great service. She told us that if we didn't like our drinks we could order something else, but we didn't bother hopping through those loops.  We ended our lunch, of course, with a slice of Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake.  Tangy raspberry syrup with lady fingers embedded into the cake & lemony cream cheese filling, it was so delicious, and the perfectly sweet finale to a great meal. yum!

806,Juvi G.,"Pomona, CA",432,597,4354.0,5.0,2013-12-16,"This is one ritzy place. And now I know they sell way more than cheesecake. In fact, the other options on their menu, (that which can be characterized as ""real food"") is probably better than the desserts.  Just about everything here is delicious, as far as I know. What I love is the sheer variety they offer. Yes, even healthy options for those of us who need to still fit into our skinny jeans the following day. It all boils down to your preferences. I always prefer to visit restaurants like these with friends or family so that we can order different menu items that catch our eye, and share them. And although the price is right, it certainly doesn't hurt to share the bill.  Curious about some of the menu items? Well, here are some of the delicacies my family and I enjoyed: 1.) Crusted Pretzel Chicken: Crispy, juicy chicken strips on a skewer, made with crushed pretzel bits and served with 2 different sauces. 2.) Chicken & Mushroom Lettuce Wraps: Light and healthy Asian -style lettuce wraps with diced chicken & mushrooms, & dried noodle bits. (FYI: The lettuce is romaine lettuce, so the chicken, mushrooms, & noodle bits are hard to grab). 3.) Parmesan Polenta Fries- Mild & creamy polenta cheese sticks, topped with parmesan cheese, and served with a side of marinara sauce. Don't expect the cheesy mozzarella sticks you find at other restaurants. This is more of a soft, creamy cheese.  4.) Avocado, Mushroom, & Zucchini Fries- Amazingly savory pieces of fried veggies served with 2 different sauces. My favorite are the mushrooms. Those are some juicy little bites of fried heaven. Veggie or not, though, I wouldn't count them as healthy. Even the endless portions of free bread they bring to your table are amazing. My favorite is that black, whole grain bread with oats. I used to think it was burnt beyond recognition, but it turns out to be soft, chewy, and subtly sweet. Try it with a bit of honey that they bring to your table. It's really good. I'm not much of an alcohol drinker, but even the booze looks & sounds great, here. They have almost every cocktail, martini, & beer you can imagine. The service is usually friendly, and as for the price: 4 of us ate to our hearts' content for a little over $46.

138,Pamela M.,"Brea, CA",459,304,1025.0,4.0,2013-12-18,"I will never say no to eating at Cheesecake Factory. I don't care if this is a chain restaurant; Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants. Their menu is so big, it could feed everyone of any preference. Except maybe vegans.... but they're probably used to that. My favorite item to get at Cheesecake Factory, regardless of location, is the chicken bellagio. It is one of the cheaper specialty items on the menu at around $15. It is a HUGE portion too. Everyone on the menu is a big portion but trust me when I say you'll have enough to take home to feed you for dinner and make you full. It's two big pieces of breaded chicken breast on top of a California king sized bed on pasta (don't know what the sauce is, I forgot) and topped with an arugula salad. It is so good. I literally get this every time I've gone here for the past 5+ years and I haven't gotten sick of eating it. My cheesecake recommendations are the red velvet cheesecake and their anniversary cheesecake. I can't remember exactly what the anniversary one is called, but I know it's in the menu and described something along the lines of their cheesecake to celebrate their many years of success as a restaurant. Look out for it on the menu because it is chocolate cheesecakey goodness. The red velvet cheesecake is bomb diggz. Just trust. Of course Cheesecake Factory is nada without their addicting bread. I personally like the wheat bread most because when paired with butter, it tastes slightly sweet and its so good. It doesn't taste anything like any other wheat breads I've had before. I thought it was like molasses bread or something intricate for the longest time ... but no its just wheat. Their sourdough bread is good too. Best when served piping hot out of the kitchen with loads-a-butta! ""Keep the bread comin'"" is my motto. The service at this location is usually very good, unless they're extremely busy, like it was yesterday when I went. it was lunch time and it's near the holidays ... the place was packed, even to the patio. The waiters had so much to do for so many tables and the kitchen was getting backed up with all the orders. I noticed they had a bunch of large parties too. My waiter this particular visit was very MIA and our food took a whopping total of 40 minutes to come out. The manager came out to apologize to us for the long wait because there were so many large parties, but still. 40 minutes?! Insanity. The food was good nonetheless. Luckily I had no time constraint, otherwise I would've been royally pissed.  I love getting cheesecake for parties and birthdays at their little bakery section. They have all the cheesecakes on the menu for purchase, frozen and ready to thaw in a couple hours. I DO NOT, however, recommend purchasing their customized chocolate plate where they write ""Happy Birthday ____"" on it for you with chocolate because they totally messed up mine. This was supposed to be a nice presentable cake and I feel like the woman that wrote on the plate played around with it and made it look awful. Not to mention, it's pretty pricey to get that plate too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=320,3.48,3.27,3.376,2.8640000000000003,3.354

186,Ivy N.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,58,24.0,1.0,2014-02-19,"I was here several weeks ago because I was craving their fried Mac and cheese. I ordered the appetizer when the server took our drink order. It took the server about 7 minutes to bring out our drinks, still no appetizer. The server had to drop off other drinks before returning to our table to take our order about 5 minutes later. After ordering our entrées, we waited about 15 minutes the entrees to arrive, still no appetizer. At this point, 25 minutes had passed since we had ordered our appetizer.  Let's get this straight, we ordered our appetizer with our drinks and still our entrees arrived before the appetizer. I had to flag down the server and inquire about the appetizer because she didn't even stop by to see if our entrees arrived correctly. She looked surprised when I brought it up and asked if we still wanted it. She left to check on it and came back with the response, ""I just checked and the kitchen burnt your first round of fried Mac and Cheese, but they're working on another one. It should be out any moment.""  We actually waited 15 minutes for the appetizer to arrive--totaling in about 40 minutes since we ordered it. By then my boyfriend had already finished his entree and I was too full to actually enjoy the appetizer. To my amazement, she still charged us for the appetizer.  Clearly our server forgot to place the appetizer order. She was surprised when I reminded her about it, and had the audacity to ask if I still wanted it. If the kitchen truly burnt the appetizer, it still would have arrived significantly earlier than our entrees. Had the kitchen also made a mistake, she would have taken the app off our bill. It was her mistake and she didn't want to own up to it. She didn't even apologize. Please don't blame the kitchen for your mistake.

Our actual server was nice but I don't understand why there is always a long wait at all hours of the day?! We waited one hour and finally got seated around 9:00PM ish. I think by then you really just want to punch out all your orders: drinks, appetizers and main entree since you waited an hour and they have the menu on display outside.  It's a nice location where you can find parking especially after the mall has closed. I did noticed some people who we were getting impatient with the valet taking a while looking for their cars. We ordered the avocado, portabello, zucchini fries which was small in portions but yummy. My friend ordered the Shepherd's Pie and I can't remember if she thought it would be in an actual pie form. It comes with a large dish and it looks like a mashed potato layer on top. I thought it was okay. It did have flavor and the meat reminded me of chunks of hamburger paddy but at least the gravy had some flavor. My friend loves Jambalaya so he has the past version of it. Big chunks of shrimp and he said it was okay. I went with trying to be healthy with the seared ahi tuna salad. Big chucks that were seared all around well but maybe like 8 pieces. Drink wise we just asked for ginger whisky and you do taste the Jack Daniels. Overall, it's a chill experience and we sat outside on the patio even though it was kinda chilly out. Heat lamps did their job or is it because we sat up against one? We went traditional on dessert and got the strawberry cheesecakes. The actual strawberries they top the slice with reminded us of the maraschino cherries.

My brother also got off the car to have a cig while waiting.  Quickly found parking with luck, and see my mom waving at me and my bro. Yay, no wait! Walked in, looking for the wife and kid who had seated, couldn't see them (big place), and my mom started asking around and was IGNORED by two busy waitresses. So it end up with us three each going down an asle like idiots to look ourselves.  4 adults and a baby on high chair, two sets of utensils on the table. Friendly waitress with a poker face quickly took our drink order and left, came back with drinks and announced she will be back with my coffee, then came back with my coffee and cream, no sugar. Waved the waitress back for sugar and TWO more sets of utensils, we have annoyed the waitress at this point judging from the poker face growing fearsome. Another waitress brought the table bread, still no utensils. Finally got my sugar and ONE set of utensils, my brave wife asked for another set. I kept my head down when the friendly waitress brings the fourth set and announced ""here you go"". My wife whispered ""she looks mad""... Yes, I know.  Round of main entrees served by other waitresses, handing us the plate, oily plates, for us to put on the table ourselves. While the waitresses quickly turned around attending to the busy lunch time, left us struggling moving the appetizer plates out to fit the entree plates. None of them thought of to clear the table.  Halfway through the meal, our waitress stopped by querying for coke refills and left before I could stop her, as I was waiting for her inquiry on coffee refill, I had 1/5 of cup left.  Potatoes with the two Sunday brunch orders were over fried, dried, and tough to bite. Angel hair pasta had an 1/8 inch oil left on the plate by the time my bro was almost done with it. Fettuccine was too salty.  Monte Cristo and Crab-hash was good, though we've given up on its accompanying potatoes.  Finally saw smile on our waitress' face when she brought our check.

704,John P.,"La Habra, CA",5,40,451.0,3.0,2014-03-26,"This was only my second time coming to the Cheesecake Factory. Well we will start off with the wait not so bad it was a solid (15) fifteen minutes not that bad at all and we waited for maybe 15-20. When we were called in we walked up to the desk as two other parties walked in after us however the other two parties kind of made their way up in front of us and with out even really looking at the tickets both of these parties where sat before us. Now I know I could have said something but I did not want to make a seen been with my family. The hosts really did not seem like they even knew we existed leaded us back to our table sat us and walked away uttering a quick word of your waiter will be with you soon. The waitress was a girl by the name of Taylor and she was awesome and wonderful really took great care of us the whole time. My Kids had the chicken strips with fries and fruit bowels that I know of the kids had no problem with their fries or chicken strips however the fruit bowels looked like some one in the back might have been opening up sealed packets from the nearest grocer and putting them in their bowel (not to tasty or fresh tasting either). My wife had a good dish called the Crispy Chicken Costoletta in many ways this was a good choice it was very tasty. I was not so lucky one of the many things I don't like about restaurants is choosing my dish because you just never know what to get and you want to enjoy what you get but you are worried that you are going to spend a lot of money on something you will regret that you ordered. So been the fact that this is only my second time here I always think to my self I will order the easiest thing on the menu thinking to my self that there is no way they can miss this up. Well I was wrong I ordered the California Cheesesteak and it was like something I could have made at home dry, dry and dry not. The meat was tough and over cooked really did not enjoy it at all. Well lets get to the desert cause I will be honest if you want a great desert then go to the Cheesecake Factory one of my kids got a regular kids Sunday he loved it I got the Rocky Road Sundae with House made Marshmallow it was what dreams are made of oh awesome if you go get this for desert. However my wife got the Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore and again a huge hit for our family we loved it. Again our waitress (Taylor) was awesome in every way she really took care of us how ever she could. So to be honest with you Yelpers it comes down to this if you want desert and want it to be a date or something special go to the Cheesecake Factory. But if you want a good main course be choosy and make sure you pick something you know you will like and hope it comes the way you wanted it to. The place is loud and looks like something out of Los Vegas it does get busy. Kids will be ok here I think my kids seemed to do ok and they are the ones to not want to sit in one place for to long. The atmosphere is very dating kind of girly and rich feeling along with the price of the food. Anyhow again like I said I have only been to this Cheesecake Factory two times in my life fare warning. One other thing I almost forgot they have roadside pick up so you can order your food and come to their curb side to pick it up I thought this was kind of cool",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=760,3.24,3.25,3.352,2.7640000000000002,3.246

She was constantly dropping by to check on us, despite the fact they were swamped with customers. All of my friends had a different dish and if I could see what they ordered, I'd describe it to you - too bad I couldn't! Food: We stuffed ourselves silly with wheat bread portions (the brown ones) and man, were they good.. as for the main dish, I ordered a salmon and steak combo ($19.95, no S&H.. ba dum dum..? No? I tried) and it came out pretty good. It was comprised with the salmon (and asparagus) on the left side of the plate, along with a vinegary type sauce underneath the fish. The steak (fillet portions, so they were already cut and rather small) adorned the right side of my plate, and were laid with mushrooms and onions. The two were separated by a line of mashed potatoes straight down the middle. The portion was rather small, and after I finished it, I craved more food. Much sad.

Nutritional menu available upon request. -Service: Always professional and friendly, no consistent problems. The bad: The main thing for me would be the calories. If you're watching your weight either come here on a cheat day or (do what I do:) order from the ""Skinnylicious"" menu and take half home for later. Otherwise, dishes are easily over 1000 calories.

Finally went up to the waiter and shift manager and asked for our drinks. The shift manager came up and apologized and said that there were only three staff (boo hop). People that came in 15 minutes after us got their food before us. Guy came up and said that he was the owner and apologized and said that he was going to take care of the check and later brought us a piece of cake (not cheesecake) that we tasted but didn't like. Pissed off super by this time. Asked for the check and paid $42 for three of us. Obviously he didn't pick up the check. Having managed major restaurants before, he was not the owner but a bad general manager.  Don't eat at Cheesecake BREA. BAD, BAD service. Used to be good but they have gone in the toilet.

Long story short we were sitting outside and the service was horrible.  Then at the end of our meal I went and told the hostess that there were 2 people at my table celebrating a Birthday.........a few minutes later a group of waiters/waitress came with 1 scoop of ice cream with a candle in it.  I told them again, there are TWO Birthdays here.  The waitress still placed the ONE ice cream between the 2 people celebrating their Birthdays and sung Happy Birthday and said since there are 2 people we are not going to use their names in the birthday song and just say from Cheesecake!

Two ladies sit to my right and they get bread and served.( DONT WORRY THE RACE CARD IS STAYING IN THE WALLET) LOL JK.  My mom jokingly said to the two ladies next to us we haven't been served and they felt so bad they offered us some bread like we were homeless. We kindly declined flagged down another hostess and she was Very nice and got someone right away. The food was bomb as Always. Can't complain.

Long wait is fine, but  throughout dinner it was clear that they were understaffed and it made it a fairly unpleasant time. Aside from the regular taking orders and delivering food, we didn't see our waiter much at all.  I'm sure he was busy, but it just wasn't with us- the staff was stretched pretty thin.  Refills and additional requests were very hard to come by.  My order came out wrong- not the waiters fault, the cook added random stuff to my burger that it doesn't come with and I needed it remade.  Normally that's a pain, but even more so that night because of the sparse staffing.  I finally got it taken back, but now other people you are eating with feel compelled to wait.  That's always annoying especially when it's a careless mistake. When the burger came back it was made correctly and the food was legitimately delicious.  That's why we keep coming back- the food rarely disappoints.  It's just everything else that's iffy.  If they could handle staffing better, it would make a better experience for the guest.  Everyone seemed to be waiting a long time for simple requests and the neighboring table chatter indicated everyone was as put off as we were.

Like Kool & The Gang ""Celebration"" song goes ""WOO HOO"".  At this time every year, they traditionally introduce a new cheesecake flavor. This year it's Lemon Meringue, a lemon cream topped with lemon mousse and meringue on a vanilla crumb crust. It would be my choice today. Tasted so smooth, creamy and full of calories. I enjoyed every bite! My wife had a slice of Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake while my daughter chose the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake. The comical sight for me to watch them thoroughly pulverize their cheesecake with grace and elegance in silence was priceless.  The portions are big enough to share, but who wants to share a slice of pure pleasure. Eat slow, take small bites and you'll be fine.

She greeted us with a smile, memorized all of our orders without writing a single thing down, brought my grandma a new plate of food since the original order was too spicy for her, and made my dad's birthday extra special! My dads favorite dessert on planet Earth is cheesecake. He was so excited to place his order, ""I'll have the original please."" Our server replied, ""Really? Just the original."" My dad firmly said, ""Well I like it."" Our server embarrassingly laughed while we hysterically laughed. When she returned, she was carrying two plates of cheesecake. On one plate, spelled out in chocolate it read, Happy Birthday Frank, while the other said, ""Because you like it."" Our table broke out in laughter yet again!

With that said, our party of four was seated fairly quickly, in around 25 minutes.  The food was what you would expect from a Cheesecake Factory, enormous portions that take a while to finish. The Jambalaya Pasta is really good and really spicy. Also, we ordered the Shepard's Pie and Seafood Gumbo and both those looked really good as well. For dessert, I went with the Red Velvet Cheesecake, which is what I always get. I recommend getting whatever cheesecake sounds good to you, because I'm sure that all of them are good. Unfortunately, the waitress we had (who's name slips my mind), was kind of slow. And she wasn't only slow for us, she was slow for the whole section of tables that she was serving. A total of 2 hrs passed from when we were seated to when we left because of the slow service. The time it took to get the food out was really long, but we had the free bread so we were satisfied.

I will eat these two flavors until I get sick of them and then continue on with the rest of my cheesecake mission. The ""30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake"" is made with layers of original cheesecake, fudge cake and chocolate truffle cream, while the ""Godiva Chocolate"" is made with layers of flourless Godiva chocolate cake, Godiva chocolate cheesecake and chocolate mousse. The cheesecake here is rich, creamy and can be very, very sweet (depending on the flavor you order). Your wallet and scale will not be happy, but indulging yourself in delicious cheesecake is worth it! I have dined in several times for brunch, lunch and dinner at this location, but have yet to find an entree that is worth ordering more than once. They have a large menu selection, so it is a great restaurant for picky eaters or those unsure of what they feel like eating.

I have visited this location two times and both times it happened to be during a busy lunch hour slot. Both within the last two months.  I have ordered the same thing every time I go to because it's always great; lunch salmon with all broccoli. Our waters with lemon came out without lemon, had to wait five minutes to see our waitress again to ask for the lemon and then waited another five minutes after that for her to realize we never got our bread basket. We tried to order when she brought us the basket but before I got a word out she was off to another table.  We waited another seven minutes to have her back at our table to take our order.  Food came out promptly and we ate pretty quick because it's always good food. But once again when we were totally finished eating we were sitting there for an extended period of time with no refills or our bill. So when we saw the waitress again we asked for a manager.  This was the kicker. The manager told us she had a few trainees on the wait staff at the moment. I don't know any restaurant management that trains newbies during their busiest time slot. It just doesn't happen for this exact reason. She went to take a percentage off our bill but the waitress had already run our card so later I found out I was double charged by them.

Whenever we're at the Brea Mall, this is one of a couple places we like to dine in. The place is spacious (over 300 maximum capacity, I looked lol) they have indoor and outdoor seating. The decor is very elegant and with the high vaulted ceiling, it's a really nice place to eat. Here's the rundown:  Miso Salmon - They have this dish down pat. And for some reason, this location makes it the best. I always get the lunch size portion, which is already a big portion. I can't imagine what the dinner portion would be. I can barely finish the lunch portions. lol. The fish is cooked perfectly. The miso glaze is just amazing. It comes on a a huge bed of rice. Yum! The sauce that surrounds the rice is just delicious! A perfect dish in my book!! Marhgarita Pizza and  Caesar Salad (Lunch Pizza and Salad - Special) - It was a dollar more to get the Caesar salad, but it was worth it. The pizza was a nice sized, heck it's probably good for 2 maybe 3 people and it was good. Yum! Grilled Cheese Sandwich (Kids Menu) - This one came with fries and a drink (milk for the boy). The grilled cheese was very good and it was also a big portion. Yum. We requested the fries cooked well done and they complied, Yum.  The complimentary bread was awesome!! Specially the wheat. DELICIOUS!! Service has been always good here. Regarding the Cheesecake, we didn't have any this time (so full). But my favorites are the Red Velvet Cheesecake and the White Chocolate Macadamia Cheesecake. You can't go wrong with either of them. This location has a little cheesecake shop inside. You can order a to go cheesecake there. And during the holidays, they also set up a table where you can get gift cards. Their current promotion, get a gift card, get a free slice of cheesecake. Win Win. Parking: I have an issue with them on that. Since it's the holiday season and they are outside of the mall. You have to park where the mall people park. Why, because their Valet closed off 4 rows of parking. That's BS in my book. There were 4 rows of empty parking spots when we got there and we could not use them. We had to park with the general population peeps. No Bueno. Aside from that, I really like coming here for brunch. You get a good meal, good service and the cheesecakes are just Delicious!!

Afterwards, we came to The Cheesecake Factory. I knew a party of 30 would be difficult, and we weren't the only large party, even on a Thursday. But we came in, put our name in, and were seated in less than half an hour. I anticipated much longer, but we got beautiful patio seating under several heat lamps that fended off the cold preceding a forecasted storm coming the next day. The servers were extraordinary. My large group, though stressful, is always joking and smiling, and the two waitresses devoted to our two long sixteen-person tables immediately followed suit. They laughed and joked along with us, while serving us quickly and without a single mistake. I wish I could remember their names, but the only thing I can say is that my server looked like a short haired Rachel Bilson. Obviously I can't speak for all thirty people on the food specifically, but I'll speak for me. Part one: the lemonade. I wasn't feeling boozy so in my search for something virgin I saw the words ""house made"". Best lemonade I've ever had at a restaurant, with a sugar-rimmed glass to boot. Then, appetizers! Spinach artichoke dip. Fried calamari. Both delicious and addictive. Then came my shrimp scampi. I always get the shrimp scampi. Throw just a twist of lemon juice over the top and you're in garlicky shrimp heaven. And, of course, the cheesecake. My Rachel Bilson inspired waitress suggested the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup cheesecake. OH MY LORD. Best ending to a meal I've had in a long time.

I know the menu is huge with lots of options but here is what I got: If you are looking to be healthy start off with the Kale Salad (small plate). It was absolutely delicious. The kale was fresh and was lightly drenched in an amazing salad dressing.  Main dish: Katsu Chicken. It was a tad bit spicy so if you don't like spicy beware. The breaded chicken and rice tasted delicious. I got my white rice switched out for brown rice. The meal comes with a creamy hot (spicy) sauce with pairs well with the chicken, rice and veggies. No need for Sriracha.  Dessert: The RED VELVET CHEESECAKE is a must! It totally made up for the terrible and slow service. The cheesecake was absolutely delicious. It was so smooth and not dry. The texture was very moist. Great cheesecake with very fresh coffee. This is the best cheesecake type in my opinion. You will not be disappointed   This place is great. I just wish the service was better. When my party had our food we realized they brought everyone's plate but our waitress forgot my Dads plate. He had to sit there for her to find his food. She also took forever to get our check (over 20 minutes).

We got there early (so we thought) at 5:30pm and had a 30 minute wait. They don't take reservations because there's always enough people to fill the place.  Their menu is probably 20 pages but half of it is advertising. They added a number of combo plates (pick two) and many of us decided it looked good. However, for most of us, it was disappointing. If you've been to a Cheesecake Factory in the past, you get used to fairly large portions. These combos were smaller than expected, especially for the price. Maybe they are now downsizing their portions but for us, as mentioned, it was disappointing.  Service was good however we did have to flag down the wait staff more than once for refills on our drinks (we may have had a newer waitress as our orders also came out in waves and two of us were waiting four minutes for meals while others at our table were eating).  But, really, overall, nothing said will impact their popularity. The place is almost always packed and their food is usually very good. We just had one of those less than stellar experiences.

143,Andrea Y.,"Walnut, CA",419,196,278.0,5.0,2015-03-23,"Cheesecake Factory has to be my favorite ""American"" chain. I always have a good experience. My friend introduced me to their shrimp and chicken gumbo, and I've been ordering it ever since. IT IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. Creamy, spicy, filled with tender chicken breast and chicken and sausage. It is an explosion of rich flavors that goes perfect with the white rice! I also love that rye bread that they serve (meh about sourdough though) at the start of your meal. It's so sweet and soft and so damn good with butter. Is it possible to come to the Cheesecake Factory and just have the Jesus diet? (Jesus diet = complimentary  water and bread....) I also tried my sisters shrimp and sausage pasta (lunch special menu) which was actually surprisingly good and really saucy! I tend to avoid pasta at restaurants because it always tastes bland to me but this one had a lot of flavor. I enjoyed eating her leftovers the next day. Her dish also took a while so they offered her a free loaded potato soup (very nice of them)...and it was also delicious. Tasted like baked potatoes with all the toppings (including bacon and cheese!) but just in a soup form. The BBQ ranch salad and Chinese chicken salad are both spot on too! Really huge portions and lots of dressing. For cheesecake, I always order the red velvet cheesecake. Pure cheesecake can be too cheesy for me but the alternating red velvet cake layers really helped to balance it out. My only gripe with this place is that it's overpriced :/ The menu is also insanely huge too and can confuse and frustrate you (paradox of choice, anyone?).

150,Diana B.,"Orange County, CA",636,241,561.0,4.0,2015-03-27,"I've been pleasantly surprised with my recent visits to the Cheesecake Factory. This wasn't my go to restaurant, but I'm starting to like it more and more after each visit.  Service: there were a lot of people waiting in line as we entered the restaurant so I expected a long wait, but the host told us that we only had to wait about 15 minutes. They gave us a buzzer, which was really confusing because they ended up calling our name instead of using the buzzer to call us back to the host stand.  Tonight, we decided to get: --buffalo blast: a twist on your traditional buffalo wing appetizer. We were expecting to get just wings, but instead, we got a plateful for large fried chicken. Once you cut into it, the shredded chicken is coated with some light buffalo sauce. On the side, there's blue cheese and buffalo sauce, with celery. The blue cheese was a little strong for me but the dish itself was delicious. --chicken Madeira: had to get this because it was the most mentioned dish on Yelp. Even the description says ""our most popular chicken dish"" so I knew I had to try. The sauce is somewhat tangy, which compliments the melted cheese on top of the chicken. The thoroughly cooked asparagus and sautéed mushrooms adds a light touch to the heavier dish. The side mash potatoes was delicious as well.  --hibachi steak: I definitely think this is underrated. When I tried a piece of this, my tastebuds exploded. The meat was so juicy and lightly seasoned. What put it over the top was the slight hint of wasabi in the mashed potatoes, which pulled the entire dish together. There's also deep fried asparagus on the dish as well. I definitely will get this dish the next time I come back. Couldn't opt for any dessert tonight, but I really wish we did because the desserts here never disappoint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=140,3.48,3.52,3.336,3.3120000000000003,3.5040000000000004

62,Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782.0,4.0,2015-04-07,"I met up with two of my friends for dinner at The Cheesecake Factory (TCF) recently on a Sunday around 6:30 p.m. For a regular March evening, the eatery was pretty crowded--more crowded than I had expected--but the hostess told me that the wait for three was only 15-20 minutes. I got my buzzer and waited for my friends, who came later, but it worked find because I think we ended up waiting about 25 minutes total.   We were quickly ushered to our table once our turn came to be seated, but I was grateful for one of the booths toward the back of the restaurant -- away from the loud hustle and bustle of the front. Our server was friendly enough, asking for our drink orders and bringing bread right away. She didn't check up on us too much throughout the evening--only once right after our meals came (we hardly had the chance to dig in and maybe one more for drink refills--but we didn't really see her again until we were ready for our check. However, we were really wrapped up in our conversation anyway, so it was fine not to be bothered.   I usually get the ""Grilled Cheese"" sandwich (that's no longer on the menu) or the ""Macaroni and Cheese Burger"" (one of the Glamburgers), but I felt like trying something different. My two friends hadn't been to TCF for dinner in a while, too, so it was a night for us to try entrees that were different from our usuals.   I was pleased with my sando and would definitely order it again. Despite the restaurant feeling busy, we had a great leisurely dinner and didn't feel like we were being rushed out of there. This is still one of my favorite CF locations ... definitely a convenient place to hit up if you're ever in the Brea/Fullerton area.   Here's what we got:   ""Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich"": I love crispy chicken (though grilled chicken is healthier), and I love the slight spice from buffalo sauce, so this sandwich was right up my alley. It featured crispy coated chicken breast covered in melted cheese and your choice of spicy buffalo or chipotle mayo sauce. It was served on a brioche bun and accompanied by French Fries or a green salad. I asked our server if the buffalo sauce was really spicy, and she reassured me that it wasn't and that she preferred that sauce. I was so glad that I ordered it! The sauce had a slight kick, but it was definitely fine for me to handle and I didn't feel like my mouth was burning for the entire evening. I didn't touch the onion and tomato that also came with my sandwich; it had enough flavor in of itself. I also opted for French fries ... I love the fries from TCF because they're thicker and always well-salted! The chicken's interior was tender and soft, and I enjoyed the sufficiently crispy exterior. Since I had a huge lunch, I ate half my sandwich--but downed all of my fries--and savored each and every bite.   ""Veggie Burger"": My friend's a vegetarian but had never tried the veggie burger, so she decided to give TCF's version a go. This ""burger"" was made with brown rice, farro, couscous, mushrooms, black beans and onions. It came on a toasted bun with melted Fontina cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and mayo. My friend took the onion out of her ""burger,"" but said that the combo was actually very good. She especially liked the blend of the brown rice, couscous and melted cheese (gotta love that Fontina). She also ordered her meal with fries and said she would definitely order it again. Like me, she's a sucker for those addictive fries from TCF.   ""California Omelette"": My friend's husband felt like ordering breakfast for dinner, so he opted for one of the omelettes. This one came with avocado, mushrooms, green onions, tomatoes, garlic, shallots, sour cream and Jack and Swiss cheeses. It also came with a choice of starch (I believe), so he opted for toast (instead of potatoes, which is what I would have ordered). The omelette was a decent size and it came with four halves of toast (so two pieces of toast cut in half). My friend's hubby said the omelette was delicious--it sported lots of gooey, melted cheese, and he liked the flavors and textures from the mushrooms, garlic and avocado. This isn't an omelette I would order personally because there are too many ingredients that I don't like, but it's a good option for those who love avocados and mushrooms (there are plenty of other omelettes I would choose instead, if I felt like ordering breakfast for dinner).   ""Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake"": I ALWAYS have to get cheesecake if I'm dining at this place--no matter how full I am--so I ordered a cheesecake to go. I always debate between the ""Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake"" or ""Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple,"" but the Reese's version won out on this particular trip. I love both cheesecakes, but I was just craving those peanut butter cups. This cheesecake features chunks of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups in the ""Original"" cheesecake, with layers of moist, delicious fudge cake and caramel.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=220,3.56,3.49,3.328,3.3440000000000003,3.5180000000000002

He seemed like a cool guy but we felt a bit rushed. He didn't seem very enthusiastic like the other server in the section next to us. Unsure if he was grumpy because he has to work on 4/20. But regardless the food tasted amazing but service could have been better. I wish they did something special for my girlfriend for her birthday. We will probably come back in the near future.

703,Serendipity S.,"Downey, CA",8,18,,4.0,2015-04-26,"Had dinner here last Sunday, for my son's Birthday. Waited for about 20 minutes, which was typical wait time.  The place have a very extensive selection of food, which was awesome.  My boyfriend had Chicken Madeira, I had the Crispy chicken Costoletta, both of which I would highly recommend if you are in the mood for a great chicken meal.  My son had the mac & cheese burger, which he enjoyed.  We came specifically for cheesecakes, which is his all time favorite desert.  He chose the Snickers Bar Chunks cheesecake, then me & my boyfriend shared the white choc caramel macadamia nut cheesecake, they both deserve to be added on top of our favorite desert list.  The thing that really made our experience great, aside from the good food, was the Outstanding service by our waitress named Jennifer.  She was everything that a good restaurant should have, on top of good quality food. Customer Service, in my opinion sets apart a good from a bad restaurant. Not to mention, we spent less having complete dinner here for 3, than a not so decent dinner at the Yardhouse in Brea for 2, with a not so good service all together. It's not the same kind of place, I know.  But consumers, do spend money to get good food, and good service.  It doesn't matter what kind of restaurant, the concept of dinning is the same.  Our server definitely earned 22% of our tip that night.  Can not wait for the CheesCake Factory to open in Cerritos, which will be closer to Downey.  This will definitely be a choice for dinning in my book.  Hopefully, the servers they hire would be as good if not better than Jennifer in Brea :') Thanks again for the outstanding service & for serving great food.  We definitely had a good dinning experience with CheeseCake Factory!

Turns out I didn't get that water and had to ask again for it. The menu, is too darn long. I think if they split the menu up into different menus according to the different services, the menu wouldn't be so large and daunting. It was extremely hard to choose what to eat as waitresses never give you enough time to really look at your menu. I got their pasta, as I love pasta, but I was a bit disappointing with my pasta looking like a brown gold pile of pasta with mushrooms and chicken. Yes the pasta was delicious, but I honestly was hoping for something that looked a bit more appealing.

I ordered off the skinnylicious menu cause I have been on summer bikini diet lately. Edamame was light and yummy as usual, fresh salmon rolls were so good, loved the sweet chili sauce. Veggie burger was delicious, the veggie patty was a little too mushy because it was made with brown rice mostly, but I still enjoyed it so much. Hubby had garlic noodles with chicken, I was surprised he picked a healthier item on the menu, he loved the noodles.  The highlight of my meal was pineapple upside down cheese cake, oh MY, it was so yummy! Pineapple upside down cake is my favorite flavor next to red velvet, it was heavenly sweet and comforting!

The shrimp sandwich and the cajun jambalaya pasta. Although there wasn't a lot of shrimp in both dishes, but I can certainly tell you it was not fresh at all.  Personally, I'm more sensitive to UN-FRESH seafood, so my body can tell. I will get small bumps and rashes or my throat will feel itchy. You might be thinking ""hey she's probably allergic to shellfish?"" SORRY I AM NOT! I guess you can say I am allergic to cheap and not fresh shellfish? Than yes I guess I will agree with you!

This was our first time ordering the avo egg roll, it looked really good in the picture, but honestly it is not worth that $11, esp when the egg roll skin is so thick and I think there are better egg roll skin to choose from like the clear rice paper ones.  The shrimp sandwich, had wayy too much mayo or whatever and not enough shrimp and the tomato slices were ginormous!! Not a well made sandwich.  As for the pasta, it tasted good, but I thought it needed a little bit more sauce and i think there was only 3-4 tiny shrimps!!!  Sigh -___- did I just pay $18 for mediocre pasta LOL.

Perfect amount of sauce, for once a place who doesn't drown the enchiladas in sauce, chicken was moist and perfectly cooked plus the side of beans and rice tasted great. In regards to the chipotle chicken pasta that is great also. I could be bias due to the fact of I love chipotle sauce or anything of that sort but the combination of creamy Alfredo but with a little kick from the chipotle sauce makes it a must have everytime you visit. Only cons I have on this location is the seating. I understand it does get busy but where we had been seated the tables were so close together we were practically sitting with the other tables and conversation between the both of us was almost impossible. Overall I would go back in a heartbeat. Giant menu and great atmosphere, with drinks expect about a $35+ bill but it is well worth it.

I like the flavor combinations on that plate.  Ok first of all we were seated way at the back near the kitchen. Which meant every few seconds we hear the loud band of servers slamming the dishes into the sink. There was a disgusting odor of either dirty mop or nasty dish rag. This was the ongoing argument between me and my boyfriend on and off through the dinner. He thought it was dish rag while I insisted it was dirty mop..anyway.... The server came and took our drink orders rather quickly but after bringing our drinks she dissapeared for a long time. After our order was taken we waited about 15 minutes for them to bring us bread which was rock hard and cold.  We got our  appetizer the ""firecracker salmon"" this is the biggest rip off ever. We got a plate of four greasy pieces of deep friend wonton like pockets. The taste was bland and way over priced for the amount you get. Do not order that appetizer. Plus it took forever for this to come out. Over 20 minutes.  I have been here before and this experience was not good at all. We asked for more bread and a server ran by and slammed our bread on the table and ran off. We had to flag someone else down for more butter. Either way the service and the fact that it smelled so gross in there ruined this dining experience. Its way to expensive to have such a bad experience.

Beware the dark bread and butter pats. It is very easy to polish off more than you planned especially it is busy and your meal takes a while to come out.  The cheesecake? I haven't been the biggest fan. We used to make cheesecake homemade when I was little and so the cheesecake here is too sugary to me.

369,Daniel S.,"Walnut, CA",68,7,2.0,4.0,2015-07-26,"There's only one thing you should ever order here. CHICKEN AND SHRIMP GUMBO. That's it! Not steak or pasta. Just CHICKEN AND SHRIMP GUMBO. I'm typically not a fan of American cuisine because I really prefer Asian food but the gumbo at Cheesecake Factory is amazing.  The gumbo has tender chicken, shrimp, and sausage drowned in a thick, creamy sauce that's filled with great spices. A bed of rice sits on top of the gumbo which soaks up all that flavor from the gumbo. Also, DON'T ORDER STEAK HERE!! They just can't seem to get it right. I came here with my family, and my cousin ordered her steak to be medium rare. It came out way past well done. She asked the waiter to have it remade. For the second time it came back WELL DONE. The meat looked as dry as the California drought. The manager then came out to ask her if she wanted to get something else which my cousin did do. One great thing about American restaurants is their customer service. You can't get that kind of service at any Chinese restaurant. The manager let my cousin get a new dish free of charge, and then she took the steak off the bill. She basically got three free meals! .   Lastly, the rye bread they serve here is the best bread I've ever had. You can really get caught up in eating more and more bread as you wait for the food. It's so ADDICTING. It has a subtle sweet flavor  Tip: Cheesecake Factory doesn't take reservations but if you have a big party you can try coming half an hour to an hour earlier to get them to prepare a setting for your group at the time you want.

There was no organization, lines were all over the place, blocking the waiters' access to the cheesecake kitchen, waiters were bumping into other waiters, people were confused. It was a hot mess.  It was crowded of course, but we stood in the to-go cheesecake line. As we were in line, we heard a waitress say to another waitress, ""Such animals! It's only cheesecake!"" She then yelled at another customer (who was inadvertently in her way), ""DONT stand there!"" We figured it was a grumpy lady having a bad day and continued standing in line browsing a menu.  When the line didn't move for a good 15 minutes, we decided to check out the situation. Turns out we were in the pickup spot and the order line was on the other side. I'd say about 15 waiters passed us while we were in line. Nobody had the sense to tell us we were in the wrong line. When we finally got to order, there was more attitude from the cashier. And then we were told we'd have to wait 30-40 minutes for our cheesecake.

I thought it was perfect and fresh. The momma bear ordered a Sheppard's pie, that was a HUGE bowl of meat, veggies, and topped with mashed potatoes. I thought it was salty and she told me she wished the meat was more tender but wasn't completely unhappy with it.

So we went to the host and told him party of two. He said, ""if you eat outside, there's no wait. Eating inside wait is 10 minutes"" ...We told him eating outside is good, yet we literally waited 14 minutes. We were confused. The host had no idea what he was talking about.  Ordered the Monte Cristo french toast. It was crispy on the outside french toast with eggs, bacon, and swiss in between the toast - served with a nice strawberry preserve dipping sauce and well seasoned crispy potatoes. The meal overall was quote good, which resulted in the average of the one star for the unnecessary wait, and the five stars for the food. The sandwich is dense and quite filling, so splitting between your wife or husband is wise with this plate. The experience can make or break a place. Although the brunch was pretty good, the wait upset us.

The food was four stars. (Too many choices!)  It's noisy inside, so it's not a place to go to chat, because you will have to scream, then duck your ear near their mouth to hear. But the waiter, was just stretched too thin. We waited 20 minutes to order. He didn't refill coffee, and we had to ask for creamer. He didn't bring ketchup for fries, or other condiments for other food. He could have saved himself from running around to fetch those things, if he had just brought them in the first place. I noticed that the table next to us was also asking for things like more salad dressing and soy sauce. We waited forever for him to bring the containers for leftovers and the check. He was friendly and polite, but was not a seasoned waiter who minimizes the number of trips to a table. Maybe if the they had a person for just refills? Maybe if they had ""waiter school"" for newbies? Maybe if they put sound absorbing materials on the walls and section dividers? Maybe if they routed diners waiting for tables in one area, and diners trying to leave go out through another area?

There are so many people here that it's hard to actually relax. The hosts need a better plan to organize the chaos of waiting for a table. The hostess who took my name offered us a seat outside because the wait was shorter. I figured it was a nice day so I agreed to that plan. Five minutes later she ""whispered"" my name to alert me to my table being ready. If I hadn't been standing next to the host desk I would have missed my table. We were escorted out to the table and sat down. The first thing we noticed was that the four appetizer plates were FILTHY. It was like they hadn't been washed at all. We quickly asked for new plates. None came. We finally went to another table, looked at the plates there to see if they were clean and grabbed them ourselves. After 15 minutes waiting, the busboy came with new plates and was embarrassed to find we had handled problem number one ourselves. He left. Our server came to the table and introduced himself. He was a fairly nice guy but he was on the quiet side. He took our drink orders and then gave us a few moments to decide what we wanted to order. When he brought our drinks out some minutes later, he asked if he wanted bread at our table. I would think this should be a given. We waited a few more minutes for bread to come and we reviewed our menu to order. Again the server was kind enough. Not Mr. Personality but kind. He took our orders and we waited for our food. The food was average. I had mentioned that I was celebrating a birthday but no birthday recognition was given. I don't expect a hundred dollar bar tab but a free piece of cheesecake or plate of appetizers or cocktail would have been appreciated.

Cheesecake factory will always guarantee the same 'ol consistency that people love. The menu is so extensive, the servers don't even know what is on the menu. I have had the fish tacos, which is great. It comes out as a huge portion and could easily feed two people. The fried zucchini is the best I have ever had.  Most recently, I had the fish and chips and they really do give you a lot of food. I believe I had 6 pieces of fish in my basket which normally, at any other restaurant, you are only given 2-3 pieces.  I have had their factory nachos as an entree even though it is an appetizer, and I'd have to say that that could feed a whole family as an entree. I barely made a dent into it and I was full.  Cheesecake factory is really successful, and I can see why. You get a lot of food, and you don't have to end up spending an arm and a leg. Service here is alright, I heard two female bartenders talking about how they'd rather go home and complain about how they were open past 11 o'clock.

However, the one in Brea is my favorite one.   I am not much of a shrimp eater, not because that I am allergic to them, but more of a preference. They say shrimps are pretty much the bugs of the sea, they eat the junks from the oceans. If you think about it, that's pretty gross, but true.  With that being said, I would eat them at Cheesecake Factory. I always order the Shrimp Scampi, I trust having them here because I know they prepare and clean them well. Everything about this place is perfect, customer service is always outstanding. The place is always immaculate. Even the price to me are decent for great foods. So why not five stars? Like I said, I think the price is decent.  The one problem I have is that they are kind of cheap with their pasta portion. With a plate over $20 bucks, you would think they give you a little more. Especially when you know pastas are cheap as hell at the market. Anyway, it's still great, but could've been five stars.

Service: The service was exceptional here! I wasn't able to catch our server's name in the beginning but she was patient while we all took our time looking through the menu and deciding on what to order but checked in on us in a timely manner. She had such a positive energy that really made the night special.  Food: Last time I came here I ordered the Jambalaya and was totally in love with all the flavors of the shrimp and sausage! But lately I've been really into Eggplant Parmesans, so I decided to go with that. My plate came with 4 eggplants covered with cheese and a side of pesto pasta. The pasta was okay but the eggplant was DELICIOUS. It was such a huge portion for about $14-15 that I was only able to eat 2 eggplants and less than half of the pasta. Well worth it! Cheesecake: Our table decided to order 3 slices of cheesecake and share so we can all try different kinds. My sister loves the original cheesecake so we ordered a slice along with the Oreo cheesecake and the new Salted Caramel cheesecake. The cheesecake slices are big and so rich and creamy that you definitely won't be able to finish one by yourself. The Oreo is verrry chocolate-y and was a tad bit too much for me. I didn't care too much for the Salted Caramel but 4 people at my table loved it! And you can never go wrong with the original!

She asked my godfather if he wanted more cranberry juice and he said sure. I felt deceived that she didnt tell us we would be paying for two. Servers should be honest and disclose if there are additional charges or fees. Also, i told her i needed a voided receipt for the wrong check that i paid for. She takes my credit card, charges me for the correct check, makes me wait 10 minutes, then comes back and tells me she cant give me a voided receipt until the other party pays for their bill.

If you're a fan of the tv show ""Big Bang Theory"", the inside looks nothing like the place Penny worked at, nor are their uniforms yellow. The Brea location is located right on the outskirs of the Brea Mall, on the corner of Brea Boulevard and Brea Mall Way.  While there's plenty of parking, you have to carefully cross a busy mall road to get to the restaurant.  During the day, its easy to cross, but there didn't seem to be much lighting to help at night. We arrived a little after noon on a Sunday, and the wait was estimated at 20 minutes.  We were told that the bar area was open, and also offered the full menu.  We decided to eat there instead, and sat on high table near the bar. and most of the patrons were watching the Vikings vs Seahawks wild card game.  While we were looking through their menu, our server took our drink order and brought a basket of squaw and french bread.  If you have never been to the Cheesecake Factory, the menu is massive. Most of the spiral bound menu is filled with advertisement, but there's pages and pages of food from salads, sandwiches, comfort food, pizza, and every version of chicken and fish you can think of.  Their portions are as big as the menu, also massive, so I was happy to see they had a lunch portion of their more popular food items. I decided on the lunch portion of their popular fish n chips, which came with a side of cole slaw, while Stephen had the falafel salad, which was a mixture of romaine lettuce, kale, feta, pita chips, and a yogurt dressing.  I would not rave about the food as being the best (hey, its a chain) but we left satisfied.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=80,3.56,3.26,3.4,2.9240000000000004,3.3800000000000003

It was a cold evening but we said it was OK because of the heaters. We were led to a table for two on the edge of the patio but our heater was off. (Every other table's heaters were on) I asked if someone could turn it on, but that's when the waitress told us it was broken but we should be fine since the other heaters residual heat would be sufficient. Seeing that we were already seated and we waited for close to an hour, we reluctantly stayed. It was fine for about 15 minutes, but my wife was getting really cold to the point of being uncomfortable. We both had light jackets on but the ""residual heat"" wasn't cutting it. I got up and politely stated our dilemma to a waiter who told me to ask the manager. (who just arrived at the table with our meals) I told him my wife was very cold and uncomfortable without a working heater, but all he said was ""Can I bring you some hot water?"" I didn't know how to respond to that, so I said NO and off he went.  Now i am not one to leave a negative review, especially when the food was delicious and our waitress was prompt and friendly, but I was taken back by the ""hot water"" comment.

The sauce was sweet and it did not go with the salmon at all. Not too sure what they were thinking pairing the sauces together. My friend also got the miso salmon and we both thought it was so gross. Can't believe I spent $20 on that crap but at least I had a gift card. It made me really really really super duper appreciate salmon from California Fish Grill. I wish I got anything else...

(closing out check)  once finished and presented with my bill , i promptly handed my visa card to my server isela v. in attempt to leave quickly.  after receiving my receipt i noticed i was double charged for my child's corn dogs ( the one which was improperly cooked). after noticing this i personally walked up to my sever and informed her of yet another mistake of the over charge.  isela v. then related this was a mistake mad by her manager (derek beck).  at this time i followed my server to her manager in order to have the error corrected. upon contacting the manager - it seemed as though he did not know of any of the mishaps which started from the moment i entered your restaurant.  this is when he finally asked about the whole experience did he seem to have concern( also due to the fact i was asking for contact information for the corporate offices). i feel it is not the customers responsibility to bring up any inconsistencies with the restaurant experience.  if i was approached : upon being denied patio seating, not receiving my beer and having to ask for it a second time, my child's food not being properly cooked, and being overcharged for my order, then possibly further mishaps could have been avoided. 5. fixing the over charge.  this was possibly the most uncomfortable experience off all. my initial charge with the over charge was -$97.52.  the manager told me that in order to fix the over charge he would have to run my visa card a second time.  he stated that first charge would not go though but would have to run the card again for the corrected amount of $93.20.  prior to this second transaction i used my smart phone to access my online banking which showed the first charge of $97.52 already pending.  the manager derek beck told me he had to charge my card again and this was my only option.  so i did the secondary charge of $93.20.  after both charges i then had a total of $190.72 pending.  this is unacceptable. the customer should not be bering the burden of a dining experience.          after further conversation with your manager about my discomfort - a $25 gift card was given to me to hopefully smooth over wrong doings.  really? a $25 gift card when you have over $190 of my money pending?  this has left a bad taste in my mouth. from beginning to end i feel your restaurant staff at the brea ca cheesecake factory -failed as a team hospitality staff = fail / did not accommodate to requested patio seating server / bar = unaware of errors with drinks orders not being delivered.  and not checking bills for errors prior to charging guests. bartender not noticing a drink order sitting on there bar top not being delivered. kitchen = fail not properly cooking a child's meal.  corn dog with batter inside and hot dog cold to touch. management = fail not stopping by a table to check with such errors as beer/and food orders. and not taking off the overcharge of the second corn dog order. having the customer to walk up to the manager to have errors fixed and having the guest ask for management information and corporate numbers instead of offering this information. this will not stop me from coming back to the cheesecake factory but has and will make me think twice if this is were i really want to eat at again. hopefully i will not be double charged for both charges that are pending and this can be where it ends. hopefully your company will read this and stop this from occurring again. j. ortiz",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=300,3.24,3.3,3.352,2.404,3.2760000000000007

It was a Saturday night and we had a party of six, including my toddler. There was a 45 minute wait that ended up taking more like an hour (at least it felt that way). The place seemed chaotic near the host desk. I was not expecting to have a pleasant dinner. But then we were seated, the host apologized for the wait (even though he had nothing to apologize for, the crowd there was insane). The waiter came right away, took our drink order, brought bread, and soon after took our order. To my surprise (and delight) he offered to bring the kids (my 1 1/2 year old and my 11 year old nephew) their food right away. YES PLEASE! That was our saving grace.  He continued to surprise us with quality service (something I didn't expect on such a busy night) and he never seemed overwhelmed with the crowd. None of the service did, in fact.

They seated us right away, in an area near the windows on the right side past the cheesecake counter. HELPFUL TIP: if they seat you in this area, ASK TO MOVE.  That seating area was disturbing. There were fruit flies everywhere, and they were flying into our drinks, food, and faces. I think they were coming from the windows. We let the host know that there were a bunch of flies and that we wanted to move. She had to go ""talk to someone"" then came back and told us we could sit in a booth right across from where we were originally sitting. That was no help at all AND we had to move our food and drinks by ourselves. I don't know about you, but that's kind of embarrassing. I've rarely had to move seats in a restaurant, and when it happens, there's normally at least 2 people that move your food. That's just restaurant etiquette. Also, you know what else is restaurant etiquette? AN APOLOGY. Nobody apologized for the fruit flies. They just kind of went ""oh..."" and went on their way. I can't even review the food because the fruit flies swarmed the dishes before we could fully enjoy it.  Good thing I had a gift card and didn't spend actual money. Needless to say, I will NOT be coming back to this location. EDIT  Contacted corporate (as a friend recommended), and they pretty much said ""Sorry you had a bad time, did you talk to the manager?

Every restaurant has good and bad nights and last night was a bad night. Yes, Saturdays are very busy but I didn't feel I got what I paid for. First, we reminded our waiter for bread and he forgot and had to be reminded again. Second, our food took over 45 mins and our waiter wasn't aware that it was running late until we mentioned it. Third, our waiter was a tad rude on top of being un-attentive. We asked for a substitution for a dish and our waiter obliged, but failed to mention it would be an additional charge while taking away the pasta from the dish. Later when we asked the waiter about it, he tried to rationalize it by saying vegetables are more expensive than pasta. Maybe he was new or doesn't have much experience with customer interaction, but I don't think this was very professional on his part. He could've worded his explanation a lot better and we left The Cheesecake Factory feeling disappointed and with a bad taste in our mouths.

They have such a wide variety of dishes on their menu from pastas to burgers and pizza. I love the complementary bread they give you before your meal. I always end up asking for seconds. I ordered their Shepard's pie last time, it was absolutely delicious. It's so awesome that an American restaurant known for their cheesecakes would have a traditional English dish, and know how to cook it so well! It's basically mashed potatoes with cheese on top of a mixture of minced beef with veggies. Sounds simple, but the flavors were so complex and perfectly blends in your mouth for the perfect bite!

I often visit this location as well as Woodland Hills, Newport Beach and Arcadia.  But last nights Service was horrible... management was a joke and on top of that RUDE! When they finally brought our food out my dish was over cooked and not edible. I nicely let the server know and she asked me if I wanted something different. I then looked at the menu and asked for a different dish that I was hoping would at least he edible. 25 min. Later while everyone had finished eating and all plates were cleared I was still sitting there waiting for my dish. I then asked if they could just put the dish in the to go box when it was finally ready. After they brought the dessert my dish was finally ready... a total of 35 min after I had sent my original dish back. Then when we got the bill they charges me for the dish that first was not edible then was brought out as we were ready to go! I then told the manager he could take the food back and to take it off the bill... and he did. I'm not one who complains for free food but I mean come on... you mess up... you should compensate for your mistakes. Not even a sorry was said... just attitude given from the managers side.

We showed up and we had to wait for our drink service. Then we waited 15 minutes for the waiter to come back and take our food order. It took 30 min for the food to come out and we were left completely alone with no one asking if we wanted or needed anything else. My daughter ordered a steak medium rare and it came extremely rare. Almost steak tar tar. The spinach she ordered with her meal was barely cooked and had no seasoning. My husband ordered roaster beets and we could not tell if it was roasted or how it was cooked because it was served ice cold. My white bean chicken chili was like warm. Not a good memorable meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=380,3.28,3.16,3.296,2.732,3.2080000000000006
836,Indy P.,"Fullerton, CA",0,58,,1.0,2016-08-29,"Hubby took me here for my birthday. Quoted a wait time of 15 minutes (we waited 25, which was not great but OK). It took 35-40 minutes to get our food (which was unacceptable). While everyone else around us (who came in much later was already halfway through their meals), we were fighting over the bread. Our waitress (Alejandra) passed our table many times but actually stopped only once to refill our bread because we were obviously starving and had devoured everything in sight that was edible. We had to flag her down after 25 minutes to ask about the food. Only then did it seem to occur to her that we had been waiting a LONG time. She brought out my entree -- Tuscan chicken -- and it was COLD, which indicates to me that the meal had been sitting there for a while waiting to be picked up by her. She told hubby that his dish was going to take longer (he didn't order anything fancy -- beef steak tacos!). We start eating MY meal together and he finally gets his tacos about 5 minutes later -- and it, too, was COLD. Aside from the temperature of the food, neither of us were impressed with the TASTE of our selections either.  Mine was supposed to be ""served over vegetables and farro."" The picture depicted showed a generous heap of farro but I could actually COUNT each grain on my plate. There was no more than a teaspoon! It was my first time ordering this so maybe that's the norm but it certainly did not look like the picture they had.  Hubby is NOT a picky eater AT ALL, but even he was underwhelmed w/ the beef tacos. Overall, a horrible experience. Oh, I had to use a butter knife on my chicken because I asked (twice) for a knife to cut my meat and after waiting 10 minutes, they brought out a knife that WAS DIRTY. The second knife they brought out (I was almost done with the meal by now), was cleaner. The only reason we came was for the cheesecakes which I love. But at $8.59 for a slice of mango key lime cheesecake, I expected a lot more than the thin wimpy stingy sliver that I got -- the 2 heaps of whipped cream (which I don't even like) covered up the cheap portion and we did not realize this until we got home. I couldn't believe it. What a rip off! Further, hubby told our waitress we were celebrating my birthday. She never once said happy birthday, nor did she offer the birthday sundae that many tables around us got.This is possibly the worse restaurant experience I've encountered this year so far -- from the wait time to the despicable portions to the clueless wait staff.

We knew what we wanted so we ordered right away. It was a while and still were waiting for our food. Our waiter said he would try to speed up the salad. We ordered Fried Zuccini and an Asian Salad.

The table behind that was seated about 10 minutes after us got their burgers and apps, including zuccini.  We still sat with no food. Our salad came out, no zuccini. Then our zuccini.

They constantly refilled our bread basket (the kids love the ""chocolate"" bread) and our drinks.  2.5 stars for food. Hubs beef dip was quite good. The bread was soft, the meat tender, and the sandwich was nice and warm. Super comfort food for sure. The kids enjoyed their salmon/rice and fettuccine dishes.  I would have given the food 4 stars but for my jambalaya, which used to be my ""go to"" entree and also happens to be one of their signature dishes. For lack of a better word, it really sucked this time. : ( You could tell they cooked the noodles then plopped them on the plate before adding the chicken & shrimp jambalaya sauce on top. It was also room temperature which means my dish sat under the heat lamp where the noodles had time to clump together.  Once I separated the noodles and stirred the sauce in, my dish was bland. Did they salt the water for the pasta, or add salt to the sauce?  Fortunately, our awesome waitress quickly brought out some more sauce for me to stir into my dish, and after adding some salt, it became more reminiscent of the dish I once loved.  Don't think I'll be ordering this anymore since I also noticed that they really skimped on the serving of shrimps which were small and overcooked.

They seriously took my review seriously and instead of being petty about it, they decided to make it right. This was actually about a month ago when it happened, so mind you I'm a bit overdue on this updated review.  I was messaged by Craig from Guest Services who apologized for the last incident that occurred when my boyfriend had food poisoning. They sent over a letter explaining that they would look into the situation that last occurred and after a few days, sent me an electronic gift card to make it up to us and give it another shot. I don't know how they figured it out but my boyfriend happened to be in town that exact week and so I took him to dinner with the gift card before he left back home to Vancouver.  This time around, the food didn't disappoint and Neal's tummy was feeling just as good as it was when he took that first bite at Cheesecake that evening.

I used to always go to the Glendale (Americana) location, but ever since I've moved to the OC area, I haven't gone. Today, I came to this location and I was incredibly SO disappointed and shocked at how salty the food was and how horrible the service was.  I basically had 5 different waiters because the first, original waiter never came back to my table and she only came to put down my order and of course give the paycheck. It's like she expected me to tip her for doing absolutely nothing. LOL. It was frustrating trying to get every server's attention because literally no one came to my table. I asked for an extra plate, more bread, and a water refill SO many times and it took literally forever. I had to ask a worker who was cleaning up the table, he wasn't even a server and he seemed to do a better job than the actual waiters. And another thing that bothered me was the first female waiter. She seemed like she looked down on me because she was very rude the short time she served my table and when I asked for more bread she went off to her male waiter friend and pointed at my table and held the bread basket up, and they both chuckled. It was very demeaning and I felt very offended. And the worst part, she never brought me my bread. And so I asked her male waiter friend for more bread and he went off to her and told her and they laughed again. I don't know what was up with those two, but I ended up just leaving because I was just so offended. Never coming back here. Also, the extra plate they gave me was super gross. It had food marks and it was just nasty. Seriously worst experience.  I got the 1. Barbecue ranch chicken salad ($14.95): comes w/ avocado, tomato, grill corn, black beans, cucumber and romaine w/ all tossed with BBQ ranch dressing. Topped w/ thin crispy fried onion rings. It was surprisingly pretty sweet and not the same as before. I was a bit disappointed. The dressing was way too much.  2. Spicy chicken chipotle pasta ($15.95): comes w/ penne pasta, honey glazed chicken, asparagus, red and yellow peppers, peas, garlic and onion in a spicy chipotle Parmesan cream sauce. This was very salty and not as good as I expected. The asparagus was the best part. Overall I'd give this a 1.5/5.

Derek came over once again questioning the temperature of our food. He said the chef handed it right from the pan....and he went as far as sticking a thermometer into my pasta to check the temperature. He agreed that the temp had dropped slightly however he felt it was still hot.   First of all, who are you to tell me how hot my pasta should be?

I will admit that the only reason that I visited the first time was because I wanted to see what all the hype was about. Since I was impressed with my visit the first time, I decided to come back with a friend. The bread is one of my favorite things. For appetizer I got the avocado eggrolls, which were just as equally appetizing. The waitress was very pleasant and helpful. For my main dish I got the Fettuccine Alfredo. The pasta was very tender and the sauce was delicious and creamy. The menu is very big and can be overwhelming, but taking the extra 5 minutes to look over everything will be worth it!

First, I have never seen breaded shrimp scampi. The breading was falling off. The sauce was dumped on the plate, no pasta like it is described. Whole garlic cloves are not pleasant to bite into either. We ordered cheesecake to go and I was shocked by the size of my slice! The used to be rather large.

799,Pyt L.,"Torrance, CA",0,6,,2.0,2017-02-28,"-Came here on a Saturday night for a birthday celebration, it was way too crowded, we waited for a WHOLE HOUR until we were called, and even when my party was called, we were called to stand around for 5 more minutes rather than being seated right away as there was another line for the parties that were called, which was fine with me but it was definitely not ideal for my grandma with her walker - this would be a 1 to 2 stars wait/operation. -The pina colada was pretty good, and the food all came out to be average (so food and beverage alone would've deserved a 3 stars.) It's not bad thought, just nothing was amazingly delicious.  -Server did an okay job, nothing to be complained about on top of my head except that she brought over some plates one time, and 2 of them were kind of dirty. Also, we've mentioned that the occasion to eat there was for my birthday celebration, and after looking up some posts on yelp & google, it appeared that Cheesecake Factory gives complementary dessert/ or sundae for birthday celebrations. However, all I'd gotten for my special day was 2 blobs of decorated free whip cream with a happy birthday message along with the piece of cheesecake that I paid for. -The mango cheesecake was really kind of below average too, and a bit too sweet..I've definitely tasted better cheesecake else where, so this was disappointing. (perhaps I should try other flavors next time) To be fair, I was a bit ticked off because all I'd received was the whip cream for my bday celebration after waiting for over an hour, so this review definitely took into consideration of that. Perhaps it's not by industry standard that every restaurant is expected to give a little something nice on an actual birthday celebration, but the experience there really just made me feel exceptionally ""unspecial"" dining there on my birthday when I could've gone else where.  Moral of the review - probably go somewhere else if you want to feel special on your birthday. (but it's a bit shocking to know Cheesecake factory can't afford to give an extra scoop of ice cream for birthday customers) (the pina colada was really good though! - maybe coming here for happy hour would be a better idea..I would appreciate 1 extra cherry to be in my cup if I'm there for a celebration - at least it has some nutritional value)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=180,3.12,3.26,3.22,2.6640000000000006,3.2040000000000006

Out of the three main dishes I tried I liked all three. Tried the burger, some pasta, and chicken tenders. The tomato based pasta sauce tasted home made and the chicken was good quality, though a bit under-seasoned. Still very good with the BBQ dipping sauce though. Just don't like ordering bland items and having to resort to sauces to enjoy it. Should be good on its own and the sauce should be there for a kick if desired in my opinion. Didn't like the dessert. We went with their Dulce De Leche cheesecake, but it tasted like caramel. Big difference! Next time I'm picking the Original! Best burger I've had all year!

I thought it had a little too much avocado. The truffle grilled cheese were good! I loved how they put whole strips of bacon instead of pieces of it. As for my main dish, I first ordered the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. I'm never picky with my food, but this dish was really sweet for my liking. I was hoping for a more savory chipotle flavor, but it was definitely not the case. As much as I was embarrassed to ask if I could change my dish, Lou was super nice about changing it for me anyway.

I always order the black out chocolate cake every time I come. When it was placed on our table today, the cake looked completely different than before, the portion was half the size and they DEFINITELY changed the recipe. It no longer tastes the same at all. Instead of having more cake, it's just layers of chocolate cream and fudge that's super sweet.  I wasn't complaining or anything I was just so shocked that the cake looked and tasted so different. But our waitress (Kara) immediately starting defending herself and saying that corporate changed everything and it's none of her business. I didn't even say anything directed at her, but as a waitress if you see that your customer is so upset with something, you really should be more kind or try to see if there's something else you can do about it.  And when I was still debating if I should ask if there's something she can do about it, she came to our table and just said ""let me get a box for you"".

The food was delivered about 10 minutes later and the salad had still not come back out. We asked for boxes when the dinner was delivered because it was just too cold. After we had eaten a bit of our food and boxed the rest up, the salad had finally come out and I asked if our server could just box it for us. Our server brought the boxed up food back with the check and said, ""I'm sorry I didn't realize you were in a hurry."" And just walked away rather than asking if anything was wrong. We paid and left and we were charged for the salad. I myself would have told a manager how long the salad had taken and asked them to take it off of the bill.

772,Will G.,"Brea, CA",46,61,298.0,1.0,2017-06-24,"Late decision to meet up w friends at Cheesecake Factory. It's been a while since I've stepped into one of these.  It was CRAZY BUSY - but the wait was less than 20 minutes.  I was sat at a booth, which I didn't like - big guy and need a little extra room - and waited all of 15 seconds to be sat at another table. AWESOME!! Waiter is nice but I'm guessing not very much of an active listener. Told him twice to please bring lemon w water. I'll try a 3rd time.  Sat at a table then my friends decided to sit at the bar - so I moved. Usually I wouldn't cause I rather sit and have conversation but I'm good.  Ordered Chicken Pizza Style and after almost 20 minutes - was told they were out of it. My whole party ordered it and so now no one was getting it and its the ONLY reason we all showed up.  So we decided to order the Chicken Romano - which I'm told is almost the same thing...which then asks the question, Why can't they make the original? Maybe the kitchens frustrated.   The Chicken Romano was fine. It looked like it was simply thrown on the plate in a fit of frustration. Finally, in all honesty it was nothing to really write home about. I'll say this...the pasta was cooked well for a chain restaurant so that's the plus.  When the bill came - and after waiting next to several dirty plates as the person next to me left and the area was never bussed by either the bart beer or the bar back (but they had time to chuckle and giggle - not so much as the iced tea was comped for the trouble.  You would think that even after they knew that we had waited over almost 30 minutes BEFORE we were informed they had run out and then waited even longer to get the food they would make some sort of gesture other than simply saying - I just found out we are out of that dish.  But, this is what happens when chain restaurants get so big they don't fee they need to pay attention to why people eat there and what customer service is all about.  Like I mentioned before - it had been a long time since I stepped into a Cheesecake Factory...I guess I was right to stay away.  What started as a pleasant experience quickly became a bad, but salvageable, experience - that wasn't salvaged.  I do hope you folks start paying attention to what is really important when people CHOOSE your restaurant to dine at - and stop taking your customers for granted.  If this is your choice to dine at - the menu is WAY BUSY - but the food, if they don't run out  is pretty good.   I'm obviously bummed about the experience and so my Star count reflects it.  There are better places to go where the service is good and the customer service is excellent - find and frequent those places. You'll experience what a good dining experience actually is.

That being said, we were sat promptly and our server was great and very attentive.  We kinda customized our order and she nailed every item on our order so it was done the way we wanted.  That was really great to see. We had the bread served with our appetizer.  The dark bread is really tasty.  However, when will  restaurants know that people do not like ice cubes for butter.  You cannot spread it as it rips your bread to shreds.  There is no excuse for that.  So, as usual we had to smash the butter underneath our plates to make it so we could use it.  Very annoying. The Fried zucchini was honestly one of the best flavored zucchini I have ever had.  Great flavor on all fronts and I wanted so much more. The salads were prepared as we like them and no, we did not have any frogs in them (sorry BJ's) thank god!  LOL The entrees came and oh my goodness, the portions are very large.  Absolutely shareable portions.  We had the eggplant parmesan with the spaghetti with a nice pesto sauce.  THe sauce was on point and the pasta was done nicely.  So, we were off to a pretty good start. To finish off, we had the Strawberry Cheesecake.  I asked for extra strawberries.  Needless to say I was very surprised that I was served eight very large strawberries.  It was a nice touch and we all ate until we were very full. So, I was pleasantly surprised by this visit.  The service was a 5, the overall food was a 4 and the overall experience was a very high 4.  That butter thing, just bugs the heck out of me.  LOL.

I really appreciate a good server when I come in contact with one, since I used to be in the food service as well.

Jumbo Shrimp flash fried and served with Roasted Garlic over Angel Hair pasta. Yeeeees in deed. The Garlic should not be discarded, but should be eaten with as many bites as possible with the pasta.

We arrived at the 20 minute mark, called in and waited 10 minutes before someone came out. When the person arrived at the vehicle he was carrying only my cheesecakes. He then gave us the bill and charged us for our order. He stated you order will be out in about 5 minutes and then asked if we would like some water while we waited. We thanked him and said yes to the water. 20 minutes later our order was finally brought out but, the water that waiter agreed to bring never showed up. At this point our cheesecakes, which are supposed to be refrigerated, have now been sitting out for about 20 minutes. My first question/issue is, why would you bring my cheesecake out 20 minutes before my food? My second issue is the excessive wait, I could have gone in, sat down, ordered and finished eating in the hour plus it took to finally get what we ordered. We now drive home, start eating and find that my four cheese pasta is SALTY and has only 2 tiny pieces of chicken. When I ask for chicken to be added to my order and pay 3-4 dollars extra, I expect at least a small breast. There must be a chicken shortage going on that I'm not aware of.

There was a table in the shade next to us, so we asked to move. The server said she could try to move us inside, as the one table in the shade, that had been vacant since we sat down, might be taken. She was gone about 5-10 minutes, during which time the before mentioned table was untouched ( there were also the shady tables we saw when we walked up, but we were told that they weren't currently seating anyone at those tables.). A head server came by and said she could seat us inside but we'd have to go wait in line for it. Awkward since we had already been served bread and drinks. We asked why we couldn't sit at the still vacant shady table and were told that someone was ""getting ready"" to be sat there. I said ""okay then.

So then I called my brother right after to check it wasn't my phone acting up and he could hear me - my phone was just fine.  Finally I call back and get through and the guys like; ""Hold on, I can't hear you very well, let me use this other phone over here.""

Usually I get the cashew chicken my favorite. Tonight I decided to try the Factory Meatloaf. It was the worst meatloaf I have ever eaten. Yes I told the waiter. He offered me something different if I wanted it. I didn't want anything else at this point. They were kind enough to take the charges off my bill. I am giving them a better rating only because they took care of my issue. The meatloaf I would rate with no stars. Anyway beware of their Factory Meatloaf. The corn was also cold and crunchy as if it just came out of a can. Again terrible. If it were not for the mashed potatoes and gravy, which was the only thing that tasted good on this whole meal.

We waited a good amount of time before asking about our food and when we finally did, the server rudely told us the other tables got their food before us because they were seated and ordered before us which was a complete lie.. On top of all that, we learned she never put our order in so she lied and made a mistake - I can look beyond the mistake but the rudeness and lie are unacceptable.  Overall, the service was horrible and the quality of the food was too..

The happy hour is only offered in the bar, which was full so we opted to sit on the patio and pay full price. I ordered a MEDIUM mushroom burger protein style. This is the first time I have ever sent a dish back. I ordered a medium mushroom burger and it came out beyond well done. It was visibly burnt to a char. I waited over 30 minutes and the burger was clearly inedible. Hesitantly, I returned the burger and the waiter told  me it would take another 20 minutes for them to remake the burger. I agreed to the 20 minutes for a new burger and then the manager came to the table. She was the most condescending person I've ever met. She made nothing but obvious, unhelpful comments. Finally I said to just cancel the burger, as I was afraid they would spit in my burger. I waited more than 30 minutes for the check and then not one thing was comped.  I was shocked, so I asked the waiter if he could comp my glass of wine. He rudely told me he would get his manager. She came to the table again and offered me dessert, even thought diet restrictions do not allow me to eat dessert (hence the protein burger). After sitting here for more than an hour and a half I did not eat dinner and finally they comped my glass of wine. I will never come back here.

I had that lemon chicken and angel hair pasta dish. The chicken seemed like it was microwaved then thrown in a pan of oil to give it some sort of ""grilled"" feel to it. Was really fatty as well. Poor dish, I don't recommend that. To be honest, the only thing I liked, was leaving. That whole night was shot from the beginning.

Those prices I could understand at the right portion but seriously both entrees looked half eaten (the full price dinner price is $17.50) looks like we got half the portion for $3 off. The online menu I found had cheesecake priced $6.95 to $7.95 of course ours is $8.50 (although this might be outdated) still the slices are clearly cut in 1/12 which places a full cheesecake at $102.00 nice.

Our server was sweet and attentive (wish I had caught her name - I think she was also tending bar if that helps. Just want management to know how great of a job she did). Overall the service was excellent.  Drinks: Mom and I ordered mimosas, which were refreshing and tasty. It seemed like they were prepared with fresh orange juice, which made them even tastier.  Food: We ordered the tamale cakes, the Thai lettuce wraps, the ahi tartare, and the stuffed mushrooms. The tamales were our favorite - so flavorful and delicious with a little kick to them. The lettuce wraps are a classic appetizer here and great as usual - I love the array of sauces and fillings, and the chicken was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The tartare with fresh avocado was scrumptious. Mushrooms were awesome - loved the sauce they were in - though they were a bit on the small side. Maybe I just wished they were bigger because they were so good! (On a side note, kudos to the staff for having to remember and be trained in such an extensive menu! I worked in bars and restaurants throughout college and grad school so I know how challenging this can be. I'm always impressed by the staff's knowledge and recall whenever I come here.)

746,Ken S.,"Brea, CA",0,44,,2.0,2017-11-29,"Wish I could give this a better rating because I go here so often but there are a few things to note about this particular location. 1. The food. I always order the same thing every time, a pasta dish. But no matter when I go, it always tastes different. It's great, don't get me wrong. But it's inconsistent. Sometimes it's spicy, sometimes it's light, sometimes it's rather tasteless. But I crave that pasta dish, so I continue to eat here. 2. The servers (for the most part) Many of them seem to hate their jobs. I get it though, serving in the food industry is one of the most stressful jobs but man, it's obviously difficult for some to maintain a smile or even a positive attitude. The service is hit or miss. 3. The food runners. Some in particular are just the worst. They just leave the food and go... there's no proper manners or simple respect. Not even a ""enjoy your meal"" or ""can I get anything else for you?"" It's just very cold and almost insulting; as if we are dogs getting fed kibble. It's pretty lame and I guarantee many people feel the same. I get it though, they have other orders to take care of, but it's not rocket science to have a positive attitude and treat customers with respect.

We had the mushroom burger,  Chipotle chicken burger,  antioxidant salad, shrimp&sausage pasta, and I had the Shepard's pie. They offer smaller portions of most of what you order I believe. They had a mix up with one of our orders but offered some side dishes while they remake our food.

My go-to dishes are Louisiana chicken pasta, and chicken pot stickers and occasionally bang bang chicken and shrimp.  Every dish tastes great, but it's the consistency in portion size that really makes me give this location only four stars instead of five.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=40,3.44,3.33,3.24,,3.374

758,Henry L.,"Buena Park, CA",26,42,8.0,2.0,2017-12-18,"Went on a Wednesday night in which the restaurant was somewhat busy. Service was definitely on the poor side, as we constantly had to wave down the server. The calamari appetizer was very salty. The main dishes, both pasta, had about half a chicken breast (if that). It's sad but this is the why we visit chain restaurants less and less. After a $70 dinner, and a poor experience, we probably won't be returning for quite a while. Good luck and I'm sure they will continue to stay busy, but I'd rather support the local mom and pop restaurants, who actually care for their customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=20,3.48,3.37,3.236,,3.414

724,Rae A.,"San Diego, CA",21,110,435.0,4.0,2017-12-26,"Can I just say this place is lit for the holidays? We waited maybe 30/40 minutes which I guess isn't too bad? Our server was super cheery which made it fun and she also hooked us up with like 3 baskets of free bread, which is always a win. Our food did take some time to come out but it was understandable.  Fried Zucchini:  4/5 It was crispy, not that oily and served with ranch. I personally have had better fried zucchini for cheaper but you know, you're paying for the atmosphere. It wasn't a huge serving and it as small slices of zucchini, very petite and cute. Fried Calamari: 4.5/5 It wasn't oily, squid was tender, served with tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. Was a good serving size and came out pretty hot. It was well seasoned, not really sure how much it cost but rentals said it was pretty good.  Bistro Shrimp Pasta: 4.5/5 It was a huge portion filled with lots of mushrooms and shrimp. It was creamy and coated with the pesto sauce but it wasn't overwhelming. It wasn't a heavy pasta dish but it was filling and it was hard to stop.  Miso Salmon:  3/5 It tasted more like teriyaki than miso. It was a little sweet. It was served with a lot more rice to salmon ratio. If you're asian, you've probably had better rice.  Cajun Jambalaya 4/5 Well, I wasn't able to try this for diet reason as per usual but my father finished it and it looked like there was a lot and also that's all I can say.  Eggplant Parmesan:  3/5 It was a little oily and had a lot of cheese, which to some people is not a bad thing. It comes with three slices of eggplant heavily coated in breadcrumbs and topped with mozzarella and marinara. It comes with a small side of pesto that was pretty much just empty carbs. It was not hot surprisingly.  New York Steak: 5/5 Wow who would have thought that steak here was pretty good? She ordered it medium well and it came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Pretty good I think because again, she finished it to the last bite.  Cheesecake Factory is another American food chain that has great service, great bread, and a great ambience. It's a good place to celebrate and as much as I try not to eat sweets, the cheesecakes are honestly, the icing on the cake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea,3.28,3.36,3.22,,3.3280000000000003

744,Meg K.,"Rowland Heights, CA",0,10,,1.0,2018-01-03,"TL; DR down below.  There were 2-3 big parties that were arriving shortly after we arrived. We got an estimated wait time of 20 mins for myself and my husband. They handed us a buzzer/pager and we decided to wait inside closer to the entry way. Why? We didn't want to block the walkway for people exiting or block other people from coming in to be with their party or to put their name down for a table. About 30-40 people were waiting to be seated, but we put our names down before they did, had a buzzer, were only two people, and the restaurant was clearing out A LOT of tables anyways. We waited for 45-60 minutes. Did not hear our name and our buzzer did not chime, light up, buzz, or signal to us that we were being called. After seeing all the parties go before us and many others who arrived way later than us, my husband went up to the host desk to ask them what was going on. They said that they had called our names already, but that they would put us at the top of the list for a table and would be about another 5 minutes. We were then FINALLY called by the host, but I asked them why we weren't actually told about our table being ready (buzzer or in person) especially since we were being very courteous to them, other patrons, and I'm pretty sure the fire codes/regulations. The host then apologized and said that sometimes the buzzers don't work... As we were talking, the person (who would later be seating us) didn't get the memo that we were already at the desk trying to get answers as to what happened. We noticed that she was calling for us with a normal volume that would not have reached to anyone unless they were REALY listening near the cheesecake display case and maybe the one seat in the waiting area. She just stood near the host desk, said the name as if she were talking normally, and gave up. No walking closer to the guests waiting near the entry way...no walking in general...  She gave up after saying our name three times because we ""didn't arrive"" and told the host that we were a ""no show"" all annoyed. The host then had to break it to her that we were already right here... A considerable amount of people have now left the restaurant and there were still about 7 people waiting to be seated. She tries to quickly change her attitude to a cheery one and sat us in a booth. We tried to forget the whole ordeal because who wants to ruin date night? However, as we were in the middle of us being seated, a waitress then complains to this person in front of us behind our booth's tiny pillar. We hear every word and this lasted for a minute or two. The person then says that a waitress will be right with us. It took 15 minutes for that waitress to come by to ask us if we wanted anything to drink. We asked for water and gave her our order right away. She came back with the waters and our bread. Our crab bites came sometime later after we had already finished half of our bread. So maybe 10-15 minutes after we ordered? No offer on any bread refills throughout the entire time. Our entree food arrived 45 minutes after we were seated, 30 minutes after we ordered because of that 15 minute wait time with our waitress.  The food at the time was good, but this entire experience wasn't. We basically complained to each other the entire meal about how this whole experience was basically about 2 hours waiting for food. I also opened my leftovers today and saw that they had my asparagus heads sticking out of the take out box when there's clearly room for it to be entirely in the box and a 2 inch white hair on top of/slightly embedded in my mashed potatoes... TL;DR: Don't trust the buzzers/pagers. Don't trust hearing your name unless you camp out near the host desk. Don't be surprised to see staff drama/attitude. Don't expect to be seen at a reasonable time after being seated. Expect the food to be okay-good, but if you get a takeout box, ask if you could pack it yourself. If they do it, don't be surprised to find extra unwanted things or bad packaging.  If any of this happens to you at the restaurant, demand to talk to someone right away. Don't think the bad experience will turn around because it likely it won't. We didn't complain right away for this reason and because we didn't want to spend any more time than we already had there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=20,3.16,3.32,3.224,,3.2560000000000007

She asked if I wanted to do curbside pick up or if I would be walking in to pick up my order. Now I know curbside pick up sounds pretty self-explanatory but as someone who has never done that I asked the silly question what exactly is that. She was completely patient and explain to me how it would work and was so nice I felt the compulsion to write this.  Update: So disappointed, went through curbside pick up and grabbed my order only to return home and realize that no utensils were included. Sounds Silly but I remember being really impressed with their take out utensil quality. I even tipped them for a to go order !! :( But was super disappointed that they didn't include butter with my bread when I specifically said to include it over the phone. I proceed to open my two pastas, and find them both lukewarm. I only live 7 mins away and also when I asked the waiter who brought my food, he told me the order had just come out.
