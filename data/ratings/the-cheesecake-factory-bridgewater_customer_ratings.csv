294,Laura P.,"New York, United States",846,391,238.0,4.0,2012-08-21,"Cheesecake Factories are a popular place, so it's never surprising to me that the wait on any given day at any given hour is, at a minimum, twenty minutes. However, surprisingly enough, my last visit to a Cheesecake Factory, with my family on a Sunday around 12:30PM, did not come with a wait and we were seated immediately. The menu is overwhelming, especially for people who have never been to a Cheesecake Factory. Two of the people I was with had never had it before and found it hard to choose just one thing to order. Our waiter was very friendly and suggested some of his favorite dishes. Clad in the classic Cheesecake Factory white outfit, our waiter was a young guy with spunk, very eager to take our orders and bring us our food. I traditionally get an appetizer as a meal because of how daunting I find the rest of the menu, as well as the portions of the regular size entrees. I got the cheeseburger sliders and a ""small plate"" of cheese quesadillas. We ordered the customary fried macaroni and cheese balls as an appetizer to share, which absolutely blew the minds of the two who had never had them before. The mac and cheese balls are really one of the best foods to get at a Cheesecake Factory, or pretty much an restaurant.  And of course I got the raspberry lemonade, complete with crushed sugar around the rim of the big glass. I absolutely adore this drink from the Cheesecake Factory and find pure joy in the very existence of it.  The decor of this Cheesecake Factory was nice, as they all are. I think it could be classified as Grecian decor? Or European in general? I'll get back to you on that.  We were celebrating a birthday during this particular visit, and about six waiters sang ""Happy Birthday"" and brought a slice of chocolate cake with a birthday candle to the birthday boy. The cake was incredible and was surrounded on its plate with homemade whipped cream. A+ in my book. No matter how long you have to wait to be seated at a Cheesecake Factory, it is always worth the wait. I waited two and a half hours on Valentine's Day with a big group of friends and dates and we all decided by the time we were seated at 10:30PM that it was well, well worth the wait. This experience at this Cheesecake Factory was no different, even though we didn't have to wait at all for the always amazing experience.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=100,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.216,3.3200000000000003

I called on Wednesday night to order a cheesecake for my coworker's birthday. I was given a gift certificate to use for CF so this was the primary reason why I wanted to order here. The girl who answered put me on hold for over 10 minutes. I hung up. I called back and was put on hold for another 5 minutes. I hung up and called back. The same girl that was playing phone games decided she was finally ready to take my order. I ordered one 7"" pumpkin cheesecake and I asked for the cake to be taken out at 11am the next day to give it plenty of time to thaw out by late afternoon. When I came in Thursday, I was informed that the girl that took my order the night prior on the phone never put the order in! Thank goodness the gentleman behind the bakery counter was very friendly, competent, and helpful. He quickly brought out a chilled pumpkin cheesecake for me and apologized. I told him not to worry as it was not his error and thanked him for his assistance. The pumpkin cheesecake was definitely a treat for the palate.

The fish I got fried not grilled and it tasted just like fried fish  you couldn't taste any seasonings other than lime juice. The black beans and the rice was phenomenal it was so yummy but it was like on the side. they gave you four fish tacos and those tacos were literally the size of my hand. over all I would recommended it for people who like large portions of food. it's definitely not something  for food adventurists.

Cheesecake Factory is great for its large menu with broad appeal for whatever a person is in the mood for. In my case, their menu clearly marks items that can be made gluten free by request. This makes the dining experience much easier for me. For lunch, I've had their burgers with the gluten free buns and they weren't bad. For dessert, they have a gluten free cheesecake that is made with Godiva chocolate. With my dietary restrictions dessert opportunities are far and few between, so I typically have one when the option is available ""because I can."" The seating is comfortable, but the service was very slow - especially when I was hoping for a business lunch that was reasonably modest in time.

She so graciously helped me find a dessert that did not have cheesecake in it, as I do not like cheesecake, and then informed me that she could pack it up in a great way to take it back to my hotel so I could eat it tomorrow (The chicken filled me up too much).  I am a big fan of the cheesecake factory in general but this stop at the Bridgewater cheesecake factory was well beyond what I usually expect. Bravo to the server Reina -she's a class act.

I love coming here because it makes me feel like a kid again and I can get anything I desire because they have everything (dessert, salad, steak, finger foods, etc) I want! To start, we ordered the Crab Cake Bites. These are what Mini Crab Cakes are supposed to be like. They are basically a fried lump of crab meat, held together with a filler. Served and paired with Hollandaise Aioli. I like them cause it's better than eating a whole crab. It'll save your fingers and time. Then our Cuban Spring Rolls came to the table. It tasted like a Cuban sandwich rolled up in a crispy tortilla and deep fried for enhanced taste and texture. It's so meaty and so cheeeesy. So good! We also had the tantalizing Ahi Tuna Tartare appetizer made from fresh ahi, tuna, avocado, cucumbers and fried wonton chips. So fresh and so good, and it will impress any seafood lover. Our last appetizer was the Corn Dog. They're a-okay. I don't understand why the dudes love this Corn Dog. I wonder what's the obsession about? Please do tell. Our entree was the Meatloaf with gravy. Not fancy, just comforting and fulfilling. Simply delicious! Main course was the Bacon Bacon Burger. Guilty guilty guilty. We ate like kings today. The food were AWESOME! We were debating which cheesecake is the best so we ordered two to try and yes it was difficult to make a choice... We agreed that the Blueberry was the best... sultry sweet and creamy... until the Godiva Cheesecake came along. Can someone tell me who invented that delicious Godiva Cheesecake? I don't know, and I don't care. All I do know is, it tasted so good! I'm addicted, absolutely, definitely and 100% in love with their cheesecakes.

I love coming here because it makes me feel like a kid again and I can get anything I desire because they have everything (dessert, salad, steak, finger foods, etc) I want! To start, we ordered the Crab Cake Bites. These are what Mini Crab Cakes are supposed to be like. They are basically a fried lump of crab meat, held together with a filler. Served and paired with Hollandaise Aioli. I like them cause it's better than eating a whole crab. It'll save your fingers and time. Then our Cuban Spring Rolls came to the table. It tasted like a Cuban sandwich rolled up in a crispy tortilla and deep fried for enhanced taste and texture. It's so meaty and so cheeeesy. So good! We also had the tantalizing Ahi Tuna Tartare appetizer made from fresh ahi, tuna, avocado, cucumbers and fried wonton chips. So fresh and so good, and it will impress any seafood lover. Our last appetizer was the Corn Dog. They're a-okay. I don't understand why the dudes love this Corn Dog. I wonder what's the obsession about? Please do tell. Our entree was the Meatloaf with gravy. Not fancy, just comforting and fulfilling. Simply delicious! Main course was the Bacon Bacon Burger. Guilty guilty guilty. We ate like kings today. The food were AWESOME! We were debating which cheesecake is the best so we ordered two to try and yes it was difficult to make a choice... We agreed that the Blueberry was the best... sultry sweet and creamy... until the Godiva Cheesecake came along. Can someone tell me who invented that delicious Godiva Cheesecake? I don't know, and I don't care. All I do know is, it tasted so good! I'm addicted, absolutely, definitely and 100% in love with their cheesecakes. I can sit in the restaurant all day and finish the entire pie in a day.

By the time our server came back to check on us, I had already eaten about half of it. Was I supposed to sit around staring at it while it got cold? Told her about the onions. She apologized but then the only remedy was I had to wait another 5-10 min for her to come back with a bowl of caramelized onions that I could add to my now-cold half of a burger.

They are not very accommodating if you bring a baby, and the hostess was so unhelpful and just giggled when she didn't know a response to a question or request for help.

I needed a highchair for him, but they WOULD NOT provide me with one if I wanted to bring the stroller (very compact in a restaurant that was 15% full max) in with me. The stroller has all his mealtime things and is also a place he likes to sit when he gets bored of a highchair after he finishes eating, as all toddlers do after eating quickly. But, even though I tried to explain this nicely, and there was plenty of room, nope!  At one point I said to the hostess, ""I don't know if you have kids or not, but here's why I think this would help...""  She giggled into her hand like a school girl and turned away. WTF?!  We made it through the meal, but I could hardly eat because I had to try to keep a toddler on an adult seat the whole time. And of course he dropped a few pieces of food on the floor, which of course I will pick up in addition to always tipping very generously when I bring the baby in case of any mess I couldn't manage to clean up myself. But I got the cold shoulder treatment. They simply didn't want young children in here. Would have been nice to know in advance. At one point when I was getting the side-eye from one of the staff due to my toddler touching the mirror placed behind his (adult!) seat and getting hand prints on it (highchair would have helped with this, guys!) I muttered to my friend, ""They hate me here, don't they?  I can never come back here.""  He replied, ""Yeah, not sure why, but definitely getting a frigid vibe in relation to your presence, LOL!""  Why did it have to be like this?  Worst and most humiliating lunch ever.

Citrus Honey dressing on the side (I find their house balsamic wayyy to oniony).  My salad was missing the tomatoes, both of our we're missing the avocado and we had to search for signs of chicken.  We also had to ask for more dressing because they brought out so little.   Service was great.  Once we got the salads together, they were great, albeit hardly any tiny chicken pieces, but a lot of greens.  We ordered dessert to go.  The Cheesecake Factory, how can you not? My friend had the Carrot Cake.  Only ate half.  Didn't think it was good.

They are not very accommodating if you bring a baby, and the hostess was so unhelpful and just giggled when she didn't know a response to a question or request for help. I was meeting a friend and had my toddler with me for lunch. I needed a highchair for him, but they WOULD NOT provide me with one if I wanted to bring the stroller (very compact in a restaurant that was 15% full max) in with me. The stroller has all his mealtime things and is also a place he likes to sit when he gets bored of a highchair after he finishes eating, as all toddlers do after eating quickly. But, even though I tried to explain this nicely, and there was plenty of room, nope!  At one point I said to the hostess, ""I don't know if you have kids or not, but here's why I think this would help...""  She giggled into her hand like a school girl and turned away. WTF?!  We made it through the meal, but I could hardly eat because I had to try to keep a toddler on an adult seat the whole time. And of course he dropped a few pieces of food on the floor, which of course I will pick up in addition to always tipping very generously when I bring the baby in case of any mess I couldn't manage to clean up myself. But I got the cold shoulder treatment. They simply didn't want young children in here. Would have been nice to know in advance. At one point when I was getting the side-eye from one of the staff due to my toddler touching the mirror placed behind his (adult!) seat and getting hand prints on it (highchair would have helped with this, guys!) I muttered to my friend, ""They hate me here, don't they?  I can never come back here.""  He replied, ""Yeah, not sure why, but definitely getting a frigid vibe in relation to your presence, LOL!""  Why did it have to be like this?  Worst and most humiliating lunch ever. Never going back, with or without my child, who, by the way, was very good for a toddler that day!  Unbelievable.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=80,3.04,2.96,3.208,3.0440000000000005,2.9920000000000004

183,Terry W.,"Dunellen, NJ",42,54,15.0,3.0,2017-02-11,"I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory, but I received a gift card from someone and on a long work evening, I grabbed up my husband and we went to this location near our home. I loved the decor, very large but inviting. There was a wait of about 10 minutes for a 2 top and so we made our way to the bar to wait.  I ordered one of their new signature cocktails; cucumber mojito - it was very good and I appreciated the bar tender letting me know it was gin and not rum before making it for me.  I prefer gin, but it was nice he thought to ask.  We were buzzed and got our table. It took a bit for our waiter to show up and when he did he looked at our table and said ""oh, you got drinks already, I'll get some bread"" and walked away.  That was it! No hi, no do you have questions on the menu, have you been here before, welcome - nothing and then he was gone - for a good ten minutes! He came back and just seemed like he was bothered to even wait on us - had a bit of an attitude.  Asked for our order, we order the chicken pot stickers to share, I got the catfish and my husband got a combo of Steak Diane and shrimp.  He repeated the orders and my husband asked for a glass of the house cab as well - that seemed to throw him off.  He asked ""you want it now?"" Yes, yes he did. lol  He then repeated our order and left. The glass of wine and our appetizer was delivered by a runner.   The pot stickers were ok.  We love potstickers and I thought I would really like them, but the chicken was a bit heavy for the light potsticker shell and fell out on every bit and seemed thick and mushy.  The soy was good, over all, I wouldn't order them again, but they weren't terrible. Our meals came and the waiter again seemed pissed off to be there - the placed the dishes in front of us and I had to act quickly as he turned to ask if I could have some extra lemon - he had already turned and was walking away! No asking if we needed anything else, no words, nothing, *slam, here's your plates, goodbye*. He brought back a small cup of lemon slices for me but literally kind of slid it onto the table as he walked by.  My husband looked at me and said ""guess he's in a mad rush for the next tip he won't get"". The catfish was good, not great, but good.  The mashed potatoes were heavy and dry.  The green beans were so far overcooked they were shriveled up bits of blackened green on my plate.  I ate one, pushed them aside.  The country corn was nice, with a bacon-y flavor with a huge amount of corn silk in it. My husband ate his with little comment, he was hungry, but afterwards said it was just *ok*.   We thought to possible get some cheesecake, after all, that is the name of the place. Someone came and took our plates, and the next thing we know, our waiter is there with words! lol  He says ""want anything else?"" Wow.  What a salesman! My husband then says ""no, I think we'll pick up someone on the way out to go"".  He walks away, and comes back five minutes later to do his slide and run again, this time with the check. By that time I had my coat and and just wanted to leave - ever feel like you're not welcome some place? Yeah, that was the feeling.  We won't be back.  What a shame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=20,3.8,3.09,3.252,2.9240000000000004,3.374

I had ordered the Hershey's chocolate cheesecake and the chocolate tasted a little different I'm wondering whether it was sitting out for over a day or if it was actually made differently I'm not sure if the cheesecakes are just shipped to the store directly so perhaps it was just old.

My order was ready when I got there and customer service was great but I did find that the cheesecake at this location taste it different than others I have been to. Some of the cheesecake slices that I picked up we're also very tiny and cut smaller than usual. All in all the cheesecake was great but I think I prefer other locations better.  I had ordered the Hershey's chocolate cheesecake and the chocolate tasted a little different I'm wondering whether it was sitting out for over a day or if it was actually made differently I'm not sure if the cheesecakes are just shipped to the store directly so perhaps it was just old. I also picked up an Adams peanut butter cheesecake and the slice was almost half the size of the Hershey's chocolate cheesecake. It was sliced thinly and the end of the slice was falling apart.

I loved the decor, very large but inviting. There was a wait of about 10 minutes for a 2 top and so we made our way to the bar to wait.  I ordered one of their new signature cocktails; cucumber mojito - it was very good and I appreciated the bar tender letting me know it was gin and not rum before making it for me.  I prefer gin, but it was nice he thought to ask.  We were buzzed and got our table. It took a bit for our waiter to show up and when he did he looked at our table and said ""oh, you got drinks already, I'll get some bread"" and walked away.  That was it! No hi, no do you have questions on the menu, have you been here before, welcome - nothing and then he was gone - for a good ten minutes! He came back and just seemed like he was bothered to even wait on us - had a bit of an attitude.  Asked for our order, we order the chicken pot stickers to share, I got the catfish and my husband got a combo of Steak Diane and shrimp.  He repeated the orders and my husband asked for a glass of the house cab as well - that seemed to throw him off.  He asked ""you want it now?"" Yes, yes he did. lol  He then repeated our order and left. The glass of wine and our appetizer was delivered by a runner.   The pot stickers were ok.  We love potstickers and I thought I would really like them, but the chicken was a bit heavy for the light potsticker shell and fell out on every bit and seemed thick and mushy.  The soy was good, over all, I wouldn't order them again, but they weren't terrible. Our meals came and the waiter again seemed pissed off to be there - the placed the dishes in front of us and I had to act quickly as he turned to ask if I could have some extra lemon - he had already turned and was walking away! No asking if we needed anything else, no words, nothing, *slam, here's your plates, goodbye*. He brought back a small cup of lemon slices for me but literally kind of slid it onto the table as he walked by.  My husband looked at me and said ""guess he's in a mad rush for the next tip he won't get"". The catfish was good, not great, but good.  The mashed potatoes were heavy and dry.  The green beans were so far overcooked they were shriveled up bits of blackened green on my plate.  I ate one, pushed them aside.  The country corn was nice, with a bacon-y flavor with a huge amount of corn silk in it. My husband ate his with little comment, he was hungry, but afterwards said it was just *ok*.   We thought to possible get some cheesecake, after all, that is the name of the place. Someone came and took our plates, and the next thing we know, our waiter is there with words! lol  He says ""want anything else?"" Wow.  What a salesman! My husband then says ""no, I think we'll pick up someone on the way out to go"".  He walks away, and comes back five minutes later to do his slide and run again, this time with the check. By that time I had my coat and and just wanted to leave - ever feel like you're not welcome some place? Yeah, that was the feeling.  We won't be back.  What a shame.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=20,3.48,3.41,3.2,,3.438

Hey, I know I could make it at home, but going out is so much more fun. The service is iffy, depends on your waiter and what night you go. Don't expect to go on a Friday or Saturday night and be seated immediately; I've had to wait 45 minutes. Bread is always endless and awesome, and the ranch dressing is the best I've ever had, and probably one of the highlights of my visits.

34,Ming K.,"Whitehouse Station, Readington Township, NJ",1,1,,1.0,2018-01-08,"On 1/5/2018 Friday night 8:55 p.m. my wife, daughter, and I went to the Bridgewater branch Cheesecake Factory for dinner. We were told there was a 30 minutes wait, and was handed a pager by the host. We were sitting on the bench waiting, and after 30 minutes I went to the front desk to check on the status. I was told by a different host that input into their system was actually a 40 min wait. I told her that when we received the pager, we were quoted a 30 minutes wait. After checking their system again, I was told that they are cleaning our table, and we will be next. After about 5 minutes, a group of three people that had received a pager after us got seated. A few minutes later another group of four got seated. After waiting for 40 minutes we were still not seated. A few minutes later another group of four people who came in and received a pager 15 minutes after us got seated. I happened to look at my watch when they sat down next to me on the bench. My daughter said she saw a group of two people who came in about 20 min after us get seated. During out wait I also saw a group of 6 get seated. I understand a group of 2 and group of 6 are seated at different tables than groups of 3 or 4. But still, a total of of 5 groups of people who received pagers after us got seated before us. I made another complaint to a woman that just showed up at the front desk. She took the pager, which never lit up, from my daughter. Instead of apologizing to me, I was told you're not the only customer here. While I was complaining, another girl took my daughter and wife to the table without even letting me know. After we were seated, I asked for the manager. The manager was the same women who took our pager. I was told later her name is Sara Solomon. I told her that I was not happy with the situation. She said they made a mistake. I asked her where is the apology. She unwillingly apologized and repeatedly said she couldn't have done anything about it. My wife told her that she mismanaged the restaurant and asked her what is the point of using the pager if you can not manage it properly. She immediately responded again with you are not the only customer here. Immediately I stood up and left the restaurant. She was basically telling me that they don't want my business. I have been a Cheesecake Factory customer for over 20 years. The first time I went to a Cheesecake Factory was in Atlanta. I was very impressed by their customer service and food. I used to go to the Edison NJ branch before the Bridgewater branch open. I will not go back to Cheesecake Factory again unless they send me an apology letter or email.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater,3.56,3.38,3.192,,3.4520000000000004
