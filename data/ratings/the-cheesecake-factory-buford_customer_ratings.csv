166,Keisha R.,"Atlanta, GA",20,178,181.0,4.0,2013-12-28,"This CF has only been open for a week and has claimed the title of busiest restaurant in the area, to no surprise, holding its own against the likes of nearby P. F. Changs, Chow Baby, Tin Lizzy and a plethora of other offerings. Exemplary meals and absolutely fantastic desserts, but you will wait a VERY long time for its goodness. Our party of two wait time today (a cold, rainy Saturday afternoon) was 1.5 hours. By the time we left it was 2.5 hours. To expedite your time here, know what you want before you get to your table. The hostesses are supposed to give you a menu once you decide you're going to stay (ours didn't, and when we asked for one we were met with attitude, hence the 4 stars). As soon as we were seated we placed our entire order, drinks, appetizers, entree, dessert and all. By the time we finished the complimentary bread our meals were ready. The speedy service definitely made up for the long wait, it's always worth it in the end but you have to have lots of patience, especially in the always busy Mall of Ga area. I don't suppose there's anything the restaurant can do about this other than consider moving to reservations only. I've been to CF's nationwide and the long wait time is pretty much standard. Tip: pay for the valet parking if you're there on a weekend. You will be hard pressed to find a spot nearby on your own.  All in all, always worth the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-buford?start=180,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997

Third time was a charm, but also around 11pm! My mediocre rating reflects the food - the wait staff and ambience were fantastic. We had the Vietnamese chilled shrimp wraps to start, they were good but not very many shrimp in each roll. My husband had the ban bang shrimp, it was delicious. I had the fish tacos; no bueno. The tempura batter was too thick, and the tortillas were stiff and hard to eat. I expected a slaw bit got dry cabbage instead. The tomato I assume was supposed to be pico was more like a canned tomato topping. I wish the tomato and crema would have come on the side bc they made my fish soggy.

163,Todd M.,"Dacula, GA",2,69,17.0,2.0,2014-01-11,"Really bad experience at the Mall of GA Cheesecake Factory.  I have been to the Perimeter location and Buckhead location for several visits, and where it is not my favorite restaurant, it is fairly reliable in terms of what you do get.  I won't get into the overpriced mediocre quality food, because that is what you get here.  It is ""Nice Event"" food for people who do not know good food and do not mind dropping $100 on a meal for two.  If you cook for yourself, you cook better than this period! What I will get into is the management of this particular location.  At the particular time we were there the wait was about 2 hours for a table.  We got lucky and got a first come/first serve high top table by the bar after waiting for about 45 minutes.  At first the mass crowd waiting for a table was out by the entrance but soon, they started  making their way into the restaurant, past the hostess area, standing around in the aisles between tables, etc.  Anywhere someone could stand, they would.  Many stood in large groups just a foot from our table where myself, wife and children were trying to have a decent dinner.  We could not look up without staring some complete stranger in the face because they were just standing there next to the tables waiting for tables to be empty.  What type of restaurant manager thinks it is OK to let customers come in and loiter around the tables where your serving meals?  I mean, if I was at a bar or a pub, I wouldn't expect anything else, but a place where the average plate is $15-$20 each??  You really should try to make the environment more enjoyable.  Our food had just arrived and I had a family come up to me, tap me on the shoulder and ask, ""Can we have your table after you are done?"".  I was shocked that me, a son of a blue collar midwest family had more decency and manners than most everyone standing around me.  In what alternate universe is it OK to come up to complete strangers at a nice restaurant, right after their food arrives and start talking to them?   Yep..I told him there wasn't a chance in h*ll that I was giving my table to him or anyone else in his family because he didn't have the common decency to allow us to enjoy a dinner we were just served. So if you like beautiful surroundings crammed full of ignorant folks who think money buys them class, this place might be for you.  Truth is you can get the exact same quality food at most of the places around Buford.  I would suggest it is worth a visit only for desert.  Go to Rico's World Kitchen or some other small, but high end food establishment...they get what it means to treat customers right!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-buford?start=180,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003

By the time I could get some butter for the muffin it was cold, hard and inedible. The bacon, which arrived at least 5 minutes after everythng else and was supposed to be soft was extra crisp, again inedible. The waitress was extremely inattentive but seemed shocked that we declined cheesecake. I've been a fan of Cheesecake Factory for many years and and have always enjoyed it, but this experience was easily outdone by the Waffle House I stopped at after so I could get something that was actually edible.

My waitress was extremely sweet and attentive. I ordered the buffalo blasts appetizer, samosas small plate, and the boyfriend ordered the Kobe beef burger. We went to the other location maybe two months ago and had the same items and both tasted the exact same.  I will definitely come back here, but on their off peak hours.  I'm taking a star off just because it's always overpriced for the food.

Don't get me wrong, the food is pretty good, but it isn't that over the top to justify the prices. That being said, the decor is really nice and the staff is super friendly. This is a great place to come to with family and it was a much needed addition to the Mall of GA.  What really stands out here isn't the food but the deserts. We had the white chocolate macadamia cheesecake and the godiva brownie sundae. Both were incredibly tasty.

121,Rachael I.,"Columbia, SC",199,83,20.0,4.0,2014-03-18,"So... This restaurant seems to have had a rough start, but it seems they've worked through all of that. I went with a friend around 6 in the evening and it was packed wall to wall. And it was everyone's birthday. The food was pretty good. We ordered the loaded baked potato bites to share. A really really heavy appetizer it turned out, but good and crispy. I ordered the buffalo wings, and my friend ordered the flatbread. We were both satisfied. Then we ordered a slice of cheesecake to share and were surprised as it is (or at least seemed) a lot smaller than cheesecake slices at other Factory locations. The price was the same too I think. Shrugs. Overall, I think Cheesecake Factories are good if you've got a lot of people to please (they're bound to like something from a menu with a 1000 items.) But for really good, fresh food, go elsewhere. I gave four stars because the service was fantastic.

156,Polar F.,"Dacula, GA",0,32,,2.0,2014-03-26,"To say we're disappointed in this location is putting it mildly. The decor is your typical cheesecake factory, as well as the menu, but the service and flavor is far from consistent. After they addressed the various health violations (publicly available via the county's restaurant inspection site) they still couldn't manage a marked improvement.  To start off, there's the service. If you go with a group the restaurant will be hard pressed to find a spot since it is unnecessarily narrow inside. The place seems bigger than it is, and can be misleading, so get ready for a wait. Hostesses are nice, they do try to seat people quickly, but do not make the best calls due to the large number of guests. I've lost count of the number of times we've been shuffled to tables near the bar and uncomfortably close to groups who should really avoid alcohol at all costs (ps, it doesn't make them as cool as they think). Thankfully, we don't have kids yet but I've seen families cringing because the large party crowd near them isn't behaving properly and don't care if a child is near. In short, this isn't a family place.  The waiters are, like any other restaurant, hit or miss. Our experience so far has been that the closer you're placed to the bar, which you can't avoid due to the previously mentioned items, the faster you'll be rushed out if you don't drink. I understand wanting to free up that space for those who will spend more money once you factor in alcoholic drinks but really, when the place is as slammed as it generally is (1-2 hour wait), the least they could do is treat you like a human being. Yes, there are nice ones  and we've had them, but overall not the majority; it's unfortunate.  The food is...bland; exceedingly so. It may be passable for someone who may have never tried some of their more exotic dishes but for those who have it's blatantly horrid. For example, any of the chicken dishes consist of pre cooked chicken (oven, fried, whatever) without any spices. Any beading follows suit and then that pile of bland food gets a ton of sauce dropped on top - and the sauce is ridiculously over seasoned to hide the bland meat beneath. The only items that so far have not shown this issue are the meatloaf and the appetizers, which taste a lot better than the entrées.  If you've never been here give it a shot, maybe you'll like it more at first but once you eventually try other locations with the same plates you may begin to notice that the flavor isn't worth the extra cost once everything else is factored in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-buford?start=140,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003

""To go"" order took 45-60 minutes. Bar asked a server to check on our meal and server just shook her head and walked off.

Also tasted like salted meat instead of a good steak. The potatoes consisted of large chunks which were subsequently crunchy in the center.

When the mall of georgia open this up I thought it would be very popular due to the lack of higher end restaurants in the area. The place is beautiful... BUT this Cheesecake Factory is also infamous for its FAILING HEALTH GRADE, the lowest at a 50 which then improves only to a 76! GROSS! But in my last visit they have improved to a 91. Which I feel after the bad scores, they should really be redoing everything to reach to 100. What didn't really help my iffy disgust with the place was that my spoon was dirty with specks of food on it. So check your utensils before you use them. The food is pricey but of course its a fancy restaurant. Your meal will come with a basket of complimentary bread and butter which you can ask for more if you finish it all because you love bread and carbs like me. The brown bread? (don't know the name sorry) is DELICIOUS and I love it. The menu also features a ""skinnylicous menu"" which is kinda self explanatory. I had some chicken and pear salad? which was alright but knowing my chicken was cold I know my food wasn't fresh. Which is understandable? but you like to have the impression that it is? The pears were yummy with my salad when I had some. The pear to salad ration was really small. My boyfriend decide he would get the filet mignon which was cook well to his opinion. He decided to a side of onion rings but they were GROSS. Flavorless and very mushy. The onion really did not have any onion taste to it rather than a watery one instead so I would avoid those. All the times I've came my service was fine but nothing I was impressed with.  If you never eat the food I think it will be okay but try a cheesecake once in your life. You can take cheesecake to go and they will put it in a container with a side of whipped cream. Which is really just whipped cream because it has no taste to it really and I guess thats because the cheesecake is sweet itself? But you must know that all the cheesecakes are frozen and sent to them. I've asked and their terminology is ""deeply chilled"". My favorite is the red velvet cheesecake but I haven't tried many of them. They also have other cakes without cheesecake if you come and are looking for dessert. There are also some flavors you can buy a whole pie if you'd like. Comes in different sizes as well but only for some flavors!

They had to take back the steak and cook it a little more. I thought the waiter was the saving grace considering food wasn't the best. Maybe it was an off day but I wanted more flavor. My water never got filled but my boyfriend got refills whenever his cup was half empty. I'm not sure how that worked out. We've been to a few of these since they're all over California and we've never had a bad experience. I don't know what happened to Georgia but they should step up their game.

48,Andrea M.,"Lawrenceville, GA",531,1117,3672.0,2.0,2014-09-21,"Um. There are definitely mixed feelings about today's visit. My bro and I had an okay ordeal overall. My friend and her friend, well, it was on the opposite end of the spectrum. It was like she wasn't meant to eat here on this particular day nor did her friend.  As she stated, everything started with the waitress then went downhill from there. Our waitress wasn't terrible by any means, but she could have been more cordial since she had a slight tone and was forgetful. At one point she somewhat let the bread basket dropped onto the table making it slide to its final resting place. Not graceful at all. Oh. And she neglected to bring it out until later too.  My friend's medium rare burger was more like a rare burger. Even the manager agreed it was so. The sweet potato fries she ordered, well, it turned into regular fries. Even though her lemonade wasn't filled in a timely manner, it was eventually refilled, and she enjoyed that. It was pretty much the only thing she enjoyed and consumed the whole time we were here.  My friend's friend... Well, her toast came out a tad too toasted. It wasn't burnt, but it was too black. That's not all. Sadly. Her omelet tasted as if it was cooked in sugar versus salt. Everyone at the table agreed so as we all did a sample taste. The manager (another gentleman this time), said that this was the second complaint of the morning. :\ And then the new toast finally came out when this second manager stopped by our table. Yikes people.  The food my bro and I had was delish. The plate was huge, and we were glad we shared the chicken madeira. We ordered the mango key lime pie to go, but haven't had a chance to taste it. I think I'd give this place another try to see how service changes, but overall, NOT impressed by any means whatsoever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-buford?start=60,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.408,2.68

We ordered chicken piccata, orange chicken, and crusted chicken Romano. All three were not at all good. Then we ordered cheesecake and they brought out half of the cheesecake. We asked them for a whole piece of cheesecake and they just added a piece to our existing cheesecake.

41,Ravi B.,"Lawrenceville, GA",1427,538,1933.0,2.0,2014-11-02,"Summary: Go straight to the bar and order a drink and cheesecake to-go. Hm... I guess you need to have a bad experience in order to appreciate the good ones. I had been having a lot of great experiences until we came to the Cheesecake Factory at Mall of GA!  The lunch started off on the wrong foot when we ordered for my cousin who was on the phone some water without ice trying to be helpful. When she realized that we ordered it wrong we asked the server for water with ice and he got defensive, but went and got us some ice water. He brought us some bread after we ordered and it was cold. I got the parmesean-encrusted chicken romano. My cousin got the orange chicken and my brother-in-law got the chicken picatta which is one of his favorite dishes that he has gotten at other locations. When we got our food, my pasta lacked flavor. My brother in law's pasta and my pasta both needed some more sauce. The orange chicken was good, but the rice was gross.  We tried to look past these issues by ordering some raspberry white chocolate cheesecake. We're thinking, well they can't screw up cheesecake! Surprisingly, we were actually sort of wrong. The cheesecake came back looking half of it was cut off. We asked our server if it was possible for a different piece. I felt like I was ""tattle-taleing on my server"" and he had to bring someone to diffuse the situation. All we wanted was a proper piece of cheesecake! He brought the manager. When the manager arrived, we could have mentioned how we didn't enjoy our food and the server was a jerk, but we focused on the simple act of a new piece of cheesecake when we didn't touch the one we got. The manager said he would get us a new one. Well our server was the one who actually got us the new piece and it looked basically like the old one with a little extra whip cream.  Ok... at that point we needed to quickly get home anyway. After getting the piece, the server took forever to get us the forks, and then the check. Maybe his life would have been easier if he just brought all 3 at once instead of flusteredly bringing them all separately and realizing he forgot the next thing.  We were disappointed the manager didn't come ask us if our complaint was resolved nor did he feel that our complaint was worthy enough for him to personally bring us the cheesecake. I have had many experiences where the manager has made my experience from poor to amazing (Example - Red Robin in Snellville). This one didn't seem to care at all.  Either this Cheesecake factory is short-staffed and our server had too many tables or he honestly didn't seem to care if we had a good experience. I rarely write about bad experiences because I usually can see the bright side. Not this time! And I have been to many cheesecake factories.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-buford?start=60,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.3760000000000003,2.8

My family and I came here around 7pm and we were quoted a 40 minute wait for a party of 3 (2 adults and a toddler). I expected there to be a wait since it was a weekend evening and 40 minutes wasn't too bad considering I've been quoted longer wait times before at The Cheesecake Factory.  After entertaining our daughter for approximately 40 minutes, we were seated.  Shortly after we were seated, our waitress came out to take our drink orders. I had their strawberry martini and it was good. It was tasty and had a nice little kick to it. We tried the ahi tuna carpaccio for our appetizer and it was really good! My husband isn't a fan of fish but he also really loved the dish. For our entrees, I had the garlic noodles with shrimp, my husband had a cheeseburger with fries and our little girl had chicken fingers with fruit. I liked how the waitress had the chicken fingers come out at the same time as the appetizer so that our little girl didn't have to wait to start her dinner. The chicken fingers came out piping hot and were actually not too bad. They came with two different dipping sauces, honey mustard and ranch. Our little girl seemed to enjoy her chicken fingers.  I really liked my garlic noodles, I just wish it came with more than just 4 pieces of shrimp. The dish was really garlicky which I loved and all the flavors melded very well together. My husband said that his burger was a standard burger but since he was craving burgers it really hit the spot for him. I was too full for dessert so decided to order a slice of white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake to go. Since it was my birthday, they brought me a little hot chocolate sundae and sang happy birthday to me.

We were celebrating a birthday and typical Friday had us waiting for a table at 8pm. The food was fantastic, personally I recommend the Seared tuna tataki salad with a Long Island Ice Tea.  The only reason for the four stars is services was delayed and slower than necessary. I understand that a full restaurant will cause delays but waiting 15 minutes for Cheesecake dessert when it's in your namesake and you pass a counter with full selection is a bit much. Maybe it was late and the girls were ready for bed, but in my opinion five star service would recognize that.

The food is alright, but it can be a bit pricey depending on what you get and then if you want dessert (which who doesn't when the place has the word ""cheesecake"" in the title), it's going to double the price considering that a slice of their cheesecake is pretty pricey too.

Needless to say, we were stressed, hungry and sticky from the heat.  We entered Cheesecake factory, and were put at ease by a very accommodating Mallori, who was attentive enough to notice as she offered outside seating that we preferred a booth. To anyone, we would probably have been met somewhat defensively, quickly mentioning to not be placed in the coldest spot in the restaurant. She was undaunted, chipper and confident, truly an asset to comforting Cheesecake factory guests. Mallori directed us to Daniel, who was gracious enough to get us seated and made sure we were copacetic, even got me the correct spelling of Mallori's name. (Stand up guy) Rameen, our charming server, was a very sincere gentleman, no trace of precocious or superficial surface there, pure professionalism, and was spot on timing with bringing out our somewhat neurotic and high maintenance requests, without flaw. All of these folks, made our visit much more uplifting, and I'm grateful to sing Cheesecake Factory's praises as a welcome prescription to an otherwise frazzled morning, into a lovely and satisfying afternoon. Great Ahi Carpaccio value at 13.50, very fresh, and our salads were also satisfying, and more than generous in portion. Rameen's familiarity of wine's will serve him well at this franchise. If in doubt, regarding pairing your taste, put your faith in this guy. Stellar service sets this place apart.

The pasta was not tossed fully into the ""sauce"" so there was a big junk of dry noodles at the bottom of the plate. Although I tried to mix everything, it just didn't taste as good as the menu described. Not even parmesan cheese could save the poor thing. Ended up taking the rest home and got cheesecake to go. We got the white chocolate macadamia one and was just like any other cheesecake I ever tasted, still pretty satisfying. I'd still rather take the bread over it.

Next, as i was telling the server my order, (burger) i noticed she was barely writing anything down, and she kept trying to sway me to get another burger that i didn't want(which made me to believe that she was that reason my food wasn't right, but I'll get to that) i told her i wanted the lettuce bacon cheeseburger with grilled onions instead of the regular raw onions, well done. She said ok but didn't write anything down so i checked again. She said it already comes with grilled onions.. I said no that menu says it comes with regular onions.. She said ok it will be grilled.. ( i know i may seem picky but for how expensive this place can be i want my food done right!) and after waiting quite some time our food arrives.... My boyfriend was satisfied with his pasta.. My burger was almost RARE. Very pink in the middle.. And dripping pinkish liquid(yuck) with NO lettuce and..... RAW red onions.. It wasn't what i asked for..

Unfortunately, this particular location at the Mall of Georgia only manages to fulfill that latter criteria. Simply put, the food was mediocre here. I've never thought Cheesecake Factory served anything eye-poppingly delicious, but this particular restaurant was just bad. I personally ordered the Classic Burger. I know I shouldn't really be ordering burgers from a Cheesecake Factory, but I expected it to taste, well, good! It was a greasy blob. Though this may, admittedly, just be at odds with my personal taste buds. The Shrimp and Angel Hair pasta was the main issue. The shrimp smelled like tap water. Had they properly rinsed and prepared the shrimp, it would not have smelled like this. And I know this isn't how it's supposed to be made, since I've had this dish at other locations just fine. Do order cheesecakes for dessert, however. They're still as wonderful as ever here. Service was also perfectly adequate. Expect long waiting times during dinnertime. I suppose if you're nearby and need to get your Cheesecake Factory fix, then this location will do. But if you're planning on driving from afar just to get some Cheesecake Factory goodies, then I'd suggest the Alpharetta location over this one. On a side note: They placed our utensils on the table bare - unwrapped and directly on the table.

Our party started with pot-stickers as an appetizer, which were fairly good.  We are used to home-made, and the C.F. versions were better than some Asian restaurants, so props for that.  As for the entrees, their burger was at least above average.  The fish tacos were also fine, and they gave you 4 of them.  The 3rd dish, some sort of pasta / scampi, elicited no complaints either.   The cheesecake (Tuxedo) we split for dessert was quite good.   Sure, it is a chain.  If you feel bad about that, look to your right as you enter and tell yourself that you aren't going to P.F.

No one eats it!  :) Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes; this is a heavenly plate of you guessed it- sweet corn tamales. It's served with sour cream on top, diced avocado and tomato. Trust me, just get it.  Buffalo Blasts; why has it taken me 15 years to try this? I'm not a huge fan of buffalo anything mainly because I don't like spicy but our waitress told me it really wasn't spicy and the buffalo sauce came on the side, so we ordered this. OMG. I love this just as much as my regular Sweet Corn Tamales. It is deep fried triangles loaded with shredded chicken and comes with blue cheese on the side as well. It is a very generous serving.  Calamari; easily one of our all time favorite calamari's. Salty, not overly chewy, comes with a delicious sauce... yum. Just yum. Avocado Egg Rolls; exactly that. I don't believe there is any meat to this, which is nice. Comes with a green sweet sauce. This is a popular appetizer, yet I think there are so many other rolls that may be better. This is literally just avocado. Tuna Tartare; a bit small considering the sizes of most dishes here. But good, refreshing and presentable.  Stuffed Mushrooms; not much to it but they are good. Especially during Happy Hour. Jambalaya; AMAZING. Literally, any and every pasta are delicious and HUGE servings. You can easily share or if that's not your thing you will probably take some home. :) There has not been one cheesecake I haven't liked here. They are all delicious. My favorite is probably Chris's outrageous cheesecake. It has chocolate chips AND coconut. It's a perfect balance and not overly sweet. Salted Caramel cheesecake is high on my list as well. To drink- I love their Bourbon & Honey. Things neither here nor there but that I will note..... I didn't have time to tell the waitress or hostess that it was my fiancé's birthday but hoped when she asked to see his ID that she would notice. She didn't, and though I cant blame her for not knowing todays date; I was secretly disappointed.  Although I have frequented this location a lot, it took me a while to come for the first time.(THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID ;-) )  No, but really... it did. Because of the failed health scores and all.... But the last two times that I have remembered to check, they are displaying a 90.... I make it a point to look at this before asking to be seated.  It HURTS my heart and soul that drinks aren't half off for Happy Hour - I heard that there is some strange law here in GA that doesn't make that legal but my god does it bother me to pay more for a drink than an entrée..... and with the possibility that it may be weak or way to strong...  The Cheesecake Factory is a delicious, reliable restaurant.

Sure, TCF is the new Red Lobster or Olive Garden. Ya know, place where people who want to feel like they stepped out went somewhere ""nice"" but it is. The Mall of Georgia location is the same. The decor is very European lite, but you're there for the food. And the cheesecake, right? I don't care about cheesecake though. I digress.  Anywho, the options are endless here, the service is good but because this is the Mall of Georgia, there is a wait at times. Make a reservation for peak times or hang out for 30-45 minutes.

We both knew what we were going to order before we even arrived so we didn't really look over the menu again. We both got the Mac & Cheese burger. My boyfriend has had it before and it was my first time trying it. My boyfriend got his Kobe styled and medium rare. I got mine well done. Literally, their mac & cheese burger is one of the best burgers you will ever have. I'm serious. I have dreams about that burger. I'm currently wishing I had one right now. We ended the night with some cheesecake to go. My boyfriend got strawberry and I got the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut. Just like the burger, I have dreams about this cheesecake too. THE BEST cheesecake flavor I've ever had. It's not sweet either, it's perfect.

Two meals out of four were delivered and then it took another 10 minutes before we got our final two orders, and once of them was missing fries. They said they were short and would bring some separately. Then another waiter comes over and tells us they switched and he will be our waiter now. At least he smiled and had a decent attitude. All of the people we saw up until that point seemed like it was a big inconvenience that they even had to work that day.  Here's a suggestion, get another job where you don't have to deal with people! As for the food, it was mediocre. Jambalaya Pasta was a little rough looking, didn't have a lot of flavor and the chicken was dry and chewy. Skinny Asian Chicken Salad looked okay but we had a hard time finding chicken. Finally found some but it was really just a few threads, and I mean like sewing thread.

99,Sarah K.,"Hoschton, GA",0,14,,1.0,2017-02-24,"I have been extremely disappointed with this particular Cheesecake Factory since they opened. One would think they would have it more together, especially considering they were shut down once already for a low health score. After speaking with Meles, the Manager, I have figured out what the problem is at this location, poor management! I asked for him after the young girl at the takeout counter was very rude and unprofessional. I made a simple request regarding my order. They said they would do it. However, when I received my order, it was not as I requested. When Meles came up he said ""that is how we always do it"". Additionally, He was very proud and argued with me.  I explained to him that I have gone to other Cheesecake Factories in Atlanta and never had a problem. He refused to make it right and I had already paid. This whole process took 45 minutes for a to go order! I was completely infuriated when I left. I called another Cheesecake Factory (that is an hour away, but always accommodates my small requests). I spoke with the Manager there, She said it would have been no problem regarding my order, so basically Meles lied to me. How sad is it that someone in a Management position lies, and will not correct an order. Do not got to this location! The customer service is horrible. They will not make any accommodations or exceptions. The food is not as good as their other locations. Also, they are very stingy about the portions.

We were greeted indifferently by a hostess who wrote our name on a card and said 'Listen for your name"" We were seated by a guy who had no clue who our waiter was -- and didn't offer to find out.  Our waiter presented herself, Kassandra. We explained our drink preferences, including to please constantly keep our soft drink filled and our margarita NOT SWEET. The margarita arrived VERY sweet and this time she said 'That's the way they do it' like there could be no variation.  She failed on keeping soft drink glasses filled and needed to be reminded EVERY time.  To speak to her, I had to hold my arm out to flag her down, else she would walk by without checking on our needs.  The management apparently spreads waiters between areas so we saw about 5 waiters in our area and her rarely, a sign of bad management and there were PLENTY of those signs! We ordered a tamale appetizer.  That was very slow arriving. Someone else brought that eventually, loaded in sour cream, although we had requested it not be included.  Its replacement was very slow arriving.  Kassandra did come by and denied hearing our 'no sour cream' request.  I ordered a filet mignon well done and requested it be butterflied to ensure it actually would be.  She said they didn't do that but they could cut it into small pieces - she called those medallions.   I told her it was common practice to butterfly steaks and I did not want chopped steak just because they didn't know how to butterfly one. She argued some more and finally I told her to keep it whole and be sure it was well done.   The meals arrived.  The steak was rare - blood red! She left my wife's meal with us and we asked for the manager.   Mellis arrived and we explained our frustration and he assured us the chef DID know how to butterfly and he seemed puzzled that Kassandra had argued the point.  My wife finished her meal (we had to request a box, as none was offered).  After a long wait, the butterflied steak arrived, well done at last.  I ate what I wanted and asked for a box.  We asked for the bill. Imagine our surprise when it was for the full amount.  No discount offered, despite a very disrupted and frustrating meal.  We asked for another visit with Mellis.  We expressed our shock to Mellis. He agreed it should have been discounted. He brought us a new bill and he ONLY removed the appetizer!  We complained.  The bill was close to $100 and the appetizer was a not-worth-it $13.

I usually do not go to chain restaurant for special dinners, but this one was just in a good location and we were all wanting a place that offered Italian food.  We had 6 adults and a toddler. The ambience is as usual for Cheesecake Factory with medium noise level and all types of attire is acceptable for this place. All of this works perfectly when you have a toddler who like to screech randomly. It just all drowned out in the restaurant noise, so I didn't feel bad or embarrased.  Around 5pm, there was a 30 minute dinner wait, but were seated right when it was 30 minutes. Our food came out quickly and was all correct. My son devoured the brown bread and my carbonara pasta, so I was happy (if a picky toddler will eat it then it must be good!). My husband had a carnesada dish and it was so delicious!

My boyfriend and I arrived around 9PM on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately and greeted shortly after. Timing of our appetizers was perfect but the entrees and presence of our server was awful after that. We waited about 15-20 minutes after we were done picking at our appetizers for our entrees to arrive. After that, our server did check on us once about 2 minutes after we got our entree before disappearing. We had to flag down another server for some togo boxes and our check because we were starting to get rather impatient.  Another thing that was bothersome was that our server couldn't keep his eye-to-eye contact because his eyes obviously looked down at my boobs...EVERY SINGLE TIME he said anything to us.  P.S. I do not recommend the Korean Cauliflower (appetizer).

The pasta both times were decent to me despite, getting two different ones. I think the restaurant focuses more on appearance than the do on taste. Service was decent. We didn't get any straws, and our waitress didn't give us straws til we decided to order cheesecake. The cheesecake there was just plain awful.

36,Briana E.,"Suwanee, GA",100,4,,1.0,2017-06-15,"First of all we went on a Wednesday evening and they were far from busy, had plenty of staff standing around doing nothing and plenty of open tables, yet several small groups of people waiting to be seated us included.  Our server was far from enthusiastic and pretty slow. After taking our drink and appetizer order we waited about 15 mins for him to come back to take our order. Throughout the evening he walked by several times empty handed and didn't even glance to see if we needed refills or anything (we did). All of that aside, I got a blood orange martini which was pretty good, just a bit too sweet for my liking. I got the spicy chipotle chicken pasta dish, chicken was chewy and some pieces were tough but the actual pasta was delicious. My hubby got the ""Famous"" Meatloaf which he said wasn't good at all (I have never heard him complain about food, that man will eat anything), but he still ate a little less than half. BIG mistake, he woke up in the middle of the night and was in the bathroom until the next afternoon. I called the Manager to warn of his sickness and let him know they needed to get rid of any Meatloaf they had left from the night before (they don't prepare these meals fresh or individually obviously). His response, ""well we haven't gotten that many calls on this particular dish"" uhmmmm, one call stating someone is sick from your food should be enough to act, and more than one call should be reason for GREAT concern!! This guy had obviously heard from at least one other sick patron regarding the meatloaf but apparently that wasn't enough for him to care or do anything about it. He offered no resolution or even concern for the situation but simply asked if I wanted him to take down my name and number. For what exactly? A get well soon card?  To summarize- We paid more that $100 for a mediocre meal (that made my hubby sick) and  mediocre service at a very poorly managed restaurant. We will NOT be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-buford?start=20,2.72,2.79,2.79,2.2760000000000002,2.7620000000000005

My mom and I stopped by for a spontaneous late lunch at around 3:15 PM  at this Cheesecake. It was still their lunch special hours until 5 (score)! The reason this time around I really enjoyed cheesecake, was because I really felt we got the bang for our buck. I ordered the BBQ chicken salad- delicious, tangy, sweet, with crispy onions- don't let the title of salad fool you into thinking it's healthy). My mom ordered the spicy Lousiana chicken pasta- farfalle sitting in spicy, tomato/hot sauce cheesy sauces topped with crispy chicken. The salad had good flavors, and the beans and corn tasted fresh; however, the salad leaves seemed to be wilting. The Lousiana pasta was also satisfying and savory! After eating 2/3 of our meal (Cheesecake's lunch portions are still the size of Alaska), we were STUFFED to stay the least. But...there's always room for dessert! We topped off the lunch with a banana cream cheesecake slice to share. It was decadent, but a bit too sweet the moment of.  The two lunch dishes and a dessert cost us $36 with tip, which I find to be more than decent for such big portions. I would say come to Cheesecake during lunch-  their dinner prices are hefty and not really worth it for the creativity and quality of the food.
