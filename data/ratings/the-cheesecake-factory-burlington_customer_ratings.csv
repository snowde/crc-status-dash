197,Sally S.,"Boston, MA",2,26,,1.0,2012-02-11,Food is overpriced microwaved salt fest. I have been here two times and both times I wanted to throw up.  Why is it so hard to get fresh food and good service without needing to spend over $500 for a meal? Dinner is $100 or more for two people.  The wait is insane. A three hour wait for that? Are you kidding me? The only people that seem to go there are bourgeois losers who like to pretend that they are the nouveau riche. Everyone and I do mean everyone was wearing a north face jacket. It seemed that if you want good service you must wear this unofficial uniform if you don't management and the waitstaff treats you like dirt.

201,michele h.,"Natick, MA",15,59,,4.0,2012-02-22,"Once again, I feel like I'm in a time warp.... I haven't eaten at Cheesecake Factory since a company Christmas party in 2003.   Last Monday, after shopping in Nashua, New Hampshire all day, The Boyfriend and I stopped here for an early dinner.  We started the Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip which I thought was good but not really my cup of tea.  The Boyfriend is a seafood-aholic so whenever we go out, he orders seafood and as much of it as he can eat. I thought the toast points that came with it where too buttery/greasy for the dip and their white bread in the bread basket was a better compliment to the dip. The Boyfriend had the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo with Brown Rice.  He loved it and ate every drop of it.  I tasted it and it was really good, complex and spicy. I ordered the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad.  I know it might seem strange but I almost always order a meal size salad here or the Thai Chicken Pasta.  They make the best giant salads filled with tons of great ingredients and chopped lettuces.  I loved this one. It was filled with tons of chicken, great tasting black beans, wonderful corn, fresh avocado and fresh tomatoes. And I can never even finish half of their salads so I get a yummy lunch the next day (I actually love the wilted lettuce the next day). The Boyfriend is not a big cheesecake fan and I was stuffed so we got a piece of Chocolate Coconut Cream Cheesecake to go.  It was perfect, heavenly and decadent. But I admit to being horrified that they charge $6.95 for a piece of cheesecake now! I could and can bake an entire cheesecake for probably the same cost!  Anyway, it was good to eat here again and I'm sure The Boyfriend and I will venture here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington?start=200,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.8640000000000003,3.0000000000000004

324,Michael K.,"Boston, MA",0,42,1.0,2.0,2012-04-03,"I have eaten at The Cheesecake Factory several times since they opened.  Recently, I have had a number of bad experiences which have led me to believe that they really don't care about their customers.  On the most recent occasion, I dined with a friend and our waitress was quite good until a problem arose; specifically, the pasta dish that I ordered contained pasta that was undercooked. She brought the issue to a manager's attention and the female manager on duty came over to our table.  She offered to make me a new dish.  It was a little awkward because the person I was with didn't want to eat her meal until my new dish was brought to the table.  By the time mine arrived, her food was cold but she didn't want to complain.  The manager never returned to see how everything was.  The waitress only returned after we were done eating to see whether we wanted dessert.  Surpisingly our bill arrived and we were charged full price for everything.  I won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington?start=320,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.7280000000000006,2.96
199,Mike W.,"Belmont, MA",386,165,492.0,4.0,2012-05-01,"It might be a bit on the pricey side here, but I can honestly say that I've never had a bad meal at a Cheesecake Factory location. One of the things I like about this place is the various options of atmosphere that they give.  They have a decent size bar with four TVs and high top seating for small groups.  A bunch of 5-6 person booths and 2-4 person tables in a open area.  Also if you want a more intimate setting some tables and booths have high backs that give you and your dinner dates a little more privacy.  If you're looking for a quiet dining experience I would suggest asking for one of the secluded tables.  Since the open area, I mentioned above, usually has a good number of families dining there and depending on the day and time those families can have loud kids. On my most recent visit I started with an order of Buffalo Blasts.  They're fried, spicy pouches stuffed with chicken, cheese and buffalo sauce.  They come served with celery sticks and blue cheese, and on the recommendation of our server we also had a side of ranch dressing for a slight change of flavor.  They're not quite as filling as normal boneless buffalo wings, but as a light starter they're not too bad. For dinner I went to the ""Glamburgers"" section of their rather lager menu, and selected the Memphis Burger.  In the words of Jules Whitfield as he bit into a Big Kahuna Burger, ""Mmmmmm this is a tasty burger!""  The burger itself is a thick, juicy and very flavorful patty which gets topped with slow roasted BBQ pulled pork, melted cheddar cheese, cole slaw, pickles and mayo.  It is quite the mouthful, and if you don't have big hands you'll probably end up cutting it in half just to make the handling of the burger a bit easier.  The Memphis Burger not only fills you up, it's an absolutely delicious meal. My girlfriend is a little less adventurous when we come here.  While I usually like to try something new each time I visit, she knows exactly what she's going to get without question.  The Thai Lettuce Wraps, which are actually an appetizer.  My assumption is they expect you to share it with the table, but if one person orders it they should be plenty satisfied with it as a meal. If there is a negative for me to point out, I guess it would be that the drinks could have been a tad bit stronger.  In other words, not much to complain about here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington?start=160,2.96,2.97,2.97,2.9280000000000004,2.966

I ordered Fettucini Alfredo with peas (custom).  For your reference, peas are delicious in alfredo sauce.  They did what I asked, and the Alfredo sauce was nice and creamy.

I ordered a ""wild"" mushroom and cheese burger, medium rare. I don't know why I bother to order anything medium rare in a chain restaurant. It's foolish to think that they will even consider making it medium rare, or be able to determine that my one burger is the medium rare burger. By the time my burger got to me it was medium well. The burger itself was tasty if HEAVILY salted. The best thing on my plate were my sweet potato fries. Perfectly cooked.  My partner got a BLT salad, which was interestingly presented- a head of lettuce was cut into giant slices, laid out on the plate and toppings added. It looked cool and was a unique way to present a salad. Our other friend ordered a BLT and it looked great.

The place gets very crowded, but they know it will be crowded so the ought to be able to keep up. Or is it just a ploy to get us to buy appetizers. The food is always ample, so otherwise I would never consider an appetizer.  This time I ordered the meatloaf sandwich. It was tasty enough, but very greasy. The meatloaf was served between 2 slices of brioche. But the brioche was saturated with fat (maybe butter) - it wasn't brushed on, it was poured on.

The main reason I am writing this is because I had to plan a birthday dinner for a group of 12 and there are a lot of picky eaters and they also didn't want to spend a lot of money.   I reluctantly called Cheesecake since I knew it would have something everyone would like, even though it pained me to call to make a reservation for a Friday night.  I was told they don't take reservations or call aheads on the weekends and left it at that.  I tried to work with the host to figure out how we could make this work but she basically told me we could show up and we would probably wait and hour to an hour and a half.  Ok thanks for trying to gain my business, you just reminded me why I hate the Cheesecake Factory.  You could give a $hit if I bring my business to your restaurant.

We were told it would be a 10 minute wait for a table, and it was much less than that, so seating and turnover is good here. Service was generally prompt. It took us slightly longer to receive our meals than we thought it should, but just as we were commenting on that, our meals arrived, though 1 of the 6 orders took another 2 minutes to be served.   Our meals were a variety of burgers, chili, and specialty salads all between $12 and $17.  There was also a mishap clearing a nearby table, which involved broken glass and water on the floor. That was attended to immediately, as were the people sitting at adjacent tables.

It's a really dimly lit place, so that was such a downer. I swear, I couldn't read the menu because it was so dark. I couldn't take pictures without flash either. It's pretty loud too, so you have to raise your voice if you want to speak to someone who isn't sitting within 2 seats of you. The cheesecake is pricey but delicious.

209,Alex G.,"Stamford, CT",2,8,,4.0,2013-11-10,"This Cheesecake Factory is pretty typical of Cheesecake Factory's in terms of layout - it's a nice-looking layout, though a bit dark inside.  I used to come here on a weekly basis, because I would stop by after a mall trip. Though convenient to mall-goers, this can be a huge downfall to those who wish to just go out to dinner, because this particular location gets so crowded! They DO NOT take call ahead seating, which means that you just have to go there and wait... Additionally, by being attached to the mall, it attracts more young kids, crying babies in strollers, and other stragglers, if you will (I figured I'd mention, since some people care about this!) Their waitstaff is usually pretty good - obviously some are better than others, and the place is usually crazy busy, so you can't always expect the best. Generally attentive and friendly. When we were going there frequently, we had a set of waiters that we would request - they were exceptional! Now on to the food... I've had a number of dishes here (all great - huge - portion sizes and I generally do not order appetizers). Here are some of my favorites: 1) Crispy spicy beef: a yummy dish, medium spice level, and yes, it is crunchy, not soggy. I enjoy this entree, a lot. 2) Renee's special: though you have a couple choices for this one, I usually get the soup of the day, a Caesar salad - great dressing but VERY garlicky, so be careful if you're on a first date/care about your breath post meal, and a chicken salad sandwich. For the price, this meal is a great value and great for your taste buds, and definitely does not leave you hungry.  3) Another favorite of mine is (I forget the name) one of the pastas. It has farfalle (bow tie) pasta, sun dried tomatoes, chicken, peas, mushrooms... And it is amazing. When in doubt of what to order at this place, get a pasta!! Though this pasta is my go-to, I've had others and they're always very flavorful and chock-full of ingredients. Their pasta is not homemade, or at least it doesn't seem it, but this is the only downfall here. Again, portions are huge.  For dessert, I've only had cheesecake - it's good stuff, very rich.

285,Ken M.,"Boston, MA",0,19,,1.0,2014-03-02,"1 Major Deduction....the wait.  I don't feel good about taking away 1 star because of the wait time as I feel like I'm holding the popularity, the price, and the quality of the food and service against The Cheesecake Factory. The wait time was colossal (75-90 minutes on a Sat. at 5pm sharp) and I really wanted to hate the place, but....I ordered the Garlic Noodles w/ Chicken and the chicken was cooked perfectly.   Not dry and stringy.  Not too undercooked, raw or greasy.  Not prefrozen, but fresh. The spaghettini was perfectly done, not too hard, not mushy. The portion was good, although I'm being greedy when I wish I had an extra piece of chicken.   It was 17 bucks, but they could have charged a buck or two more for the quality....might also discourage some of the troglodytes and mallrats if they jacked up the price a little. The only thing that hurts this place are the patrons.   I'm not above everyone that eats there, but when the wait times creep up to 3 hours and you have people fighting over a bench in the waiting area because they've been standing for so long, it takes away from the pleasantness of dining out, and the ambiance of a 'nice' night out at a 'fancy' restaurant. Update - I'll never go here again.  ""It takes years to gain a customer, seconds to lose one.""  The hostess actually made an effort to upset our party.  We went on an off-peak time for dinner, and asked if we needed one of the beepers.  The response from the Hostess was that the wait will be less than 5 minutes and to just wait to the side and she'll get us a table almost immediately.  From there, things quickly went south; I would have been ok with a 5, 10, 15, even a 20 minute wait, but, after nearly 30 minutes later, and party after party after party getting seated ahead of us, I decided to speak up.  I wasn't impolite, but received a reaction like I had just insulted a dignitary.  She told us that ""those people were waiting outside and were here before [us].""  Liar liar pants on fire!  Would it have been that hard to admit that you forgot us by mistake? That's not the end of it, though.  As if to punish me for having the audacity to question her, she then proceeded to let in several other parties that came in (like most of the others that were let in ahead of us that came in after us) from the parking lot. After close to 10 more minutes, another member of my party spoke up, and was given the same line and this time they were challenged.  I intervened, told them to forget about it, that we were leaving. Went to Buffalo Wild Wings (haven't reviewed them yet....TL;DR - Food was pretty bad, but the service was lovely!).  I wrote a letter to the corporate office about that particular staff member, and as of several weeks after this incident, no response from them.

144,Pablo R.,"Belmont, MA",6,27,4.0,5.0,2014-07-07,"Summary: Delicious food. Must  have time to enjoy. Friendly service. Tad pricey. Tons of options. (If it applies, great gluten-free selection!) Tonight was my first time ever at the Cheese Cake Factory, and I was truly impressed. I've been to the mall many times, and parking is fickle (sometimes you get lucky, most of the time you have to walk a bit). Today  I was lucky and got a place right next to the restaurant. I wasn't really sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. The menu itself was expansive, and it took me a solid 10 minutes to skim through the whole thing. Deciding on a plate was its own beast, because so many of the options looked fantastic. The waitress was more than friendly, and continually assured us there was no rush. I decided on the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta - nothing but high praise, but we'll get there. The bread they served was great, and I probably ate more than I should  have as a result. The pasta was delicious. A bit spicy, but its clearly labelled as such so I'm not going to doc points for that. The portions are massive, so make sure you're hungry when you come in! I typically eat a lot, and I still had to take half of it home because I couldn't finish it all. In the end I also got a slice of desert, and it completely lives up to the standard its name sets. If you're looking for good food and a nice night out, you can't go wrong here. I should also mention that I went with somebody who has a gluten-sensitivity, and she was blown away with the vast selection they have on their gluten free menu, in contrast to  the sparse pickings which typically plague someone with those limitations. She chose a pasta dish (a chancey move for gluten-free), and had no complaints about her meal either.  The whole dinner for two came out to $50 dollars, which is far more expensive than I usually ever go. But they give you so much that we ended up taking about half of it home - so if you think about it as 2 meals, that  comes out to 25$ for great food, which is a more than reasonable price. Definitely a recommendation for families, friends, and couples.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington?start=140,3.6,3.29,3.29,3.3160000000000003,3.414

208,Michela M.,"Malden, MA",2,13,,2.0,2014-07-17,"Dined on 7/15/2014. I am a waitress myself so I am always cautious of myself and my family members to be ""Polite"" and not do things to other servers that would be irritating to myself :) . so when I tell you  this experience was ridiculous I mean it was RIDICULOUS. WE sat down in the lounge (did not ask for it, but was fine with it) I  was joined by my mother and my grandmother. We usually come every 2 weeks to catch up and have lunch. Waitress came over introduced hereself, took our drink order, brought bread fine. no complaints. She came back asked if we wanted an appitizer (I was at a Cheesecake Factory in Florida about a month ago and they did a 4-6 happy hour, so I asked) Do you guys do happy hour here? and her response was ""I dont know what time is it?"" I looked at her, and said ""I don't know the exact time?"" (WAS THAT THE QUESTION? my grandmother said 4:12, she said ""then I guess we do, but if you were sitting in the dining room we would not give it to you, only in the lounge."" OK GREAT THANKS? .. I said ""well since we are sitting in the lounge, do you think we could do it?"" She said ""Yup I'll get you the menu, did you know about our little secret?"" I said ""what secret?"" ""she said happy hour?"" I said ""Well apparently not since I just asked you about it"" she brought the menu told us she would give us a few minutes.  She came back, I was thinking of ordering the Tuna tempura rolls. She asked if we had any questions, I said yes, ""What is Nori?"" She said ""I don't know...."" I said ""Oh, Okay"" She said ""Why is it on the Menu? I have  worked her for 9 years and have never heard of it."" My grandmother said - it is the seaweed the Sushi is rolled in. Well the waitress HAD to make it known again, she's worked here 9 years and has never been asked and she knows EVERYTHING. OK great it's fine you didn't know it, it's a big menu relax. We order, buffalo blasts (amazing) Tuna tempura, 2 small salads, and said everything would be fine to come out together. 5 minutes later the two salads came up, she put them down and said ""well they were ready, is it okay if I put them down?"" - were we supposed to say no?. She puts them down, I did not get a salad so I had nothing, does not really bother me. couple minutes later, The Tuna roll comes up. Presentation was beautiful. Again she mentions the Nori and shows me where it is in the  roll, yup thank I get it. I should have read the menu, i know Tempura means fried, but I was expecting the Sushi to be a little more on the raw side then fully cooked and did not like it (Not anyone's fault, just was not for me!) She came over and i told her not to worry It just  wasn't for me, she says ""Oh yeah, you just must not know a lot about Sushi."" ........ NOPE, I do thanks, i just did not expect it to be cooked and do not like it. 15 minutes into the meal still no buffalo blasts, and we were not in a rush at all so we did not notice. The manager came over which was VERY nice apologized and said they would be right out and acknowledged they were taking a long time. 5 minutes later a food runner brings them out. we start eating them (mainly myself since I did not end up having a meal), waitress comes over tops 3 minutes later with the dessert menu and immedietly starts talking about cheesecake, and is staring at us. ""Is anyone interested?"" .. well probably not, since the last of our meal JUST came out. She says ""I'll leave the menu for you."" we continue eating, she comes back about 10 minutes later, which was fine, but asks us again- can we digest or? My grandmother gives her the food and says you can just wrap it. Wraps it brings it back, asks if we want Coffee, we order 2 cups. My mom was outside, we said she might want something shell be back in a few minutes. 5 minutes later she comes back with anothe waitress to let us know it's shift change and she will be taking over from there. IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT, she asks the other waitress if she knows what Nori is, the waitress did. ARE YOU KDIDING ME, let it go lady we could have cared less if you know what it is, get over it. Was pretty obvious why she wanted to rush the cheesecake because it was time to go home. and noting to your customers that it is ""shift change"" is the tackiest of tacky. I love the cheesecake factory and have had too many good experiences to say I would not go back, but it baffles me how some people maintain a job for several years with this odd, rude, behavior.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington?start=200,3.56,3.26,3.26,2.9520000000000004,3.3800000000000003

That being said, I don't like their busy hours - the waitress always seem to have a rush attitude as opposed to the waiters, this is my personal view - so I ask for a male server.  My huby's favorite was the ""Fresh Salmon with a Delicious Lemon Sauce, Asparagus and Mashed Potatoes."" He skipped the mashed potatoes and got the Mac and Cheese - they were so cheesy for my own sake, I doubt he will order those again.  Me - Gosh! I really never get to the meal menu since I am always ready to dive in with the dessert.  Price wise: Gosh everything is reasonably price - both my man and me probably ran about $45 of a final bill but then again that was worth every nickel.

We always love coming here because the food is delicious and the quality is always consistent. We got the avocado rolls as appetizers and as usual, they're yummy and filling. With those on top of the bread basket though, it's really easy to get full so you might want to skip on the appetizer if you want to make room for your entree and dessert. I got the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta as my entree, my usual, and only ate half because I wanted to save room for dessert. I took out the other half for leftovers since leftovers from Cheesecake Factory are still good. Since it was an early dinner and since we ate so much, we didn't get dessert which we both ended up regretting! Make room for dessert!  Our waiter was Jack P, if I recall correctly, and his service was pretty standard. We weren't sure if he was a little down because it was so busy or if it was because we ordered water (waiters assume you won't tip generously because you ordered water). We honestly ordered water because we already had a sugary drink right before. Since it was the holiday season and because my best friend is a waiter, we tipped Jack P more than we normally would.

It was served with grilled chicken, pickled cucumbers, julienned carrots, cold noodles, and comes with 3 sauces. Each sauce was very tasty. The chicken scampi was also very good. The pasta was al dente! I hate when my pasta is overcooked. The scampi sauce was garlicky and delicious. It had the perfect balance of acidity and savory mixed together.  The service was absolutely wonderful! The waitress who served our table was a lovely lady. She was very attentive and served us right away, even though she was juggling with several other tables. She made sure our drinks were filled. Because the table for 2 was too small for all of our dishes, she even went to the extent to push the table next to us over, so we had more space.

I do like the fact that they do have their Skinnylicioius menu, which offers many delicious items for under 600 calories. Came here with some coworkers one weekday evening and despite arriving around 7:30pm, there was still a 30 minute wait. Having eaten at a number of different Cheesecake Factory locations, this is pretty typical. This location hands out a beeper that only works in and around the restaurant. Considering this location resides at a mall, they should really move to a system that typically texts you 10 minutes before your table will be ready. That's what the Cheesecake Factory does in my home location, which is also located in a large mall. At any rate, wait time was pretty close to what was quoted. It can be a little noisy in the restaurant making it a little hard to have a  conversation. Our waiter was just OK...not rude but not overly friendly either. On this visit, I went with one of their flatbreads off their Skinnylicious menus, which was good and left room for me to have their lemon meringue cheesecake, which is one of my favorite cheesecakes here. As always, I enjoyed the complimentary white and wheat bread loafs that you are given.

Not to speak of the prices --a 22 oz draft beer $8.50, and stringy thin regular fries that come in a little cone are $3.95 (same type that you probably buy at Burger King for $1). At least if you're going to sell fries at that price you should make them home made or better than just the fast food joints. All that said, and then we had to wait for 1 hr 45 minutes and I am not teasing about the timeframe. I don't get it.  What is all the rage about this place?  It doesn't make sense.

Probably 10-15 minutes. As always, I was overwhelmed by their menu, which seems like it's 50 pages and I'm sure most of those items never get ordered.  Our server was very patient with our large group and provided excellent service throughout. I ordered the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club with no bacon (chicken, avocado, tomato, swiss, mayo). It was fine. Tasty and a bit messy. Probably not worth the price, but not bad. One of the people in the group was dissatisfied with her Cobb Salad, so I offered her the other half of my sandwich, and she really enjoyed it. The fries were good as well. For dessert, we got the Oreo dream Extreme Cheesecake, which was really disappointing. It's a base layer of fudge cake, then a middle layer of their original cheesecake with Oreos baked in, then a layer of Oreo cookie mousse, topped with milk chocolate icing. I'm an Oreo fan, but nothing about it stood out to me. The cake was pretty cold (must have just come out of the fridge), so it wasn't very moist. The original cheesecake layer wasn't anything special to me, either. The best layer seemed to be the Oreo mousse, but I got sick of that quickly because it was so sweet. Wouldn't order again.

I opted for the macaroni and cheese burger which is basically a huge burger cooked to order, topped with one of their fried mac n cheese balls, sitting under more melted cheese. If you haven't guessed it already, it's one heck of diet bomb but it's so amazing. The mac n cheese ball comes out fresh from the fryer with a nice crunchy crust so when you put the top bun on top and press down, there's an audible cracking sound before the ooey gooey mac n cheese starts oozing out all over the burger.  I ordered a salad on the side instead of fries (though I held no illusions that this was an even remotely healthy meal) and ended up only eating half of my burger. Their portions are almost comically large so it's not always easy to save room for dessert. I managed to save a little bit of room and ordered a slice of the reese's peanut butter chocolate cake cheesecake.

As the chain is billed to have the usual American-style food with twists on various cultural dishes, it's broadly got something for everyone. Our latest visit was just after a morning of shopping, so it was righteous to treat ourselves to a decent meal to refuel before the next round. The bf and I arrived just after 2pm, and were seated promptly despite a bustling floor. We were assigned a waitress named Cassandra, and found that the menus we were given were all new. It's been awhile since I've seen clean menus and new items here. So we sat and ordered our rounds of water. We promised Cassandra we would be ready within five minutes to place our order. She returned to our table after 15 minutes; had we not had bread on the table, we probably would have keeled over from low blood sugar. Her lack of enthusiasm for the job really set the tone for the rest of the meal; the expectation bar fell pretty low. I ended up ordering the lunch portion of the chicken piccata, while the bf ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich. Another 20 minutes later, our food arrives. At least Cassandra checked on us within 10 minutes of our eating. The food was good, and as usual, very large in quantity. By the time we were close to done, the bf asked her for the check so we could escape, especially since we had already been seated for over an hour for what we thought would be a brief lunch.

194,Callie H.,"Nashua, NH",26,14,7.0,3.0,2015-10-16,"Planned a trip to the Burlington Mall and Cheesecake Factory with a friend a while ago. We were so excited to eat here since this was the place to be when in the Burlington Mall. The Cheesecakes are just amazing. The food was great...but the service was just absolutely dreadful. We received a buzzer that would go off in 20 minutes. When the buzzer did go off a little after 20 minutes we notified the hostess. Once we told them anther hostess said ok it will be just one moment and she went to a nearby table asking another couple to leave their table so we could eat there. I find this very rude to ask to leave your table especially if you have a lot of food left on your plate. The servers moved them and their food to another table. To who ever was at this table I am so sorry about that and I would have let you stayed and waited until the next table was done. Once we were seated there was no silverware so that came straight after. I did notice the silverware not very clean. Looked like they might have been taken out of washer and not dried with a cloth right away. We were given waters and bread, which was nice. When we were ready to order food my friend asked for a special request. She wanted the lettuce wraps but instead wanted the chicken greek salad in the wraps. ""May I please have the greek instead without the cucumber in the wraps?"" He asked why she didn't want cucmbers, and she doe not like them""Is this possible"" she asked. The waiter said ""no."" My friend asked, ""then what can you do?"" Thinking that he would be accommodating to a paying customer and making her happy he would have suggested something or given her what she wanted. But instead he said, ""Nothing."" I looked up at my friend and the two tables next to us could here what he said and both looked at us thinking, ""What did he just say?"" ""You will only be getting a little olive, arugula, and cheese if you get the chicken greek salad,"" he said. ""It is tiny and it will not be enough food."" They were going back and forth about the greek salad. If he did allow her to have what she wanted it would have costed more anyways. No waiter ever says ""No I cannot do anything for you. "" She could not get what she wanted and made my friend feel very uncomfortable and embarrassed. So she stuck with the regular lettuce wraps. The two tables next to us started talking to us like this is crazy. When he brought it out he said ""Look now doesn't that look better? The other dish would have been very little."" Kaazur, I believe that is how you spell it does not know how much she is able to eat and should not have said that. We could not believe the service we were experiencing. I ordered the grilled chicken avocado club, which was terrific which I would order again and make myself at home. She did not finish hers. When she saw the waiter again she pointed take-out box please. He looked at her and gave a hand gesture to the side of his legs that was stating, ""You couldn't finish that, it was so small.?"" UNBELIEVABLE. Yup... no tip and spoke to the Mike the manager which didn't help at all. All he said was, ""Im sorry."" Nothing about he would talk to his staff member. Just, Oh sorry, oh so very sorry."" Will be back again but no with that waiter again. This is really not his profession. I have been here in the past with a positive experience but this by far is the WORST service I have ever had when dining out, not just including this particular restaurant. No waiter should ever make a paying customer uncomfortable and embarrassed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington?start=160,3.48,3.49,3.49,3.1480000000000006,3.486
84,Brian L.,"Concord, MA",1,46,3.0,2.0,2015-10-17,"So I've been hearing about the Cheesecake Factory for years and tried one at the International Mall in Tampa ... not bad. Yesterday, I ran into a high school friend at the Burlington Mall and we went to the local Cheesecake Factory for a quick dinner.  One of my worst dinner experience of the past year. I was told the wait was going to be about 50 minutes and the ""beeper"" wouldn't work in the Mall.  Thinking we had at least 30 minutes to roam the mall before we had to be in ""beeper range"", we ran over to the Apple Store for 15 minutes ... not good.  We got back to Cheesecake Factory 20 minutes after we left there and we had ""beeped"" in the meantime. We solved that issue and were seated.  Fenway Park is somewhat quieter, but OK ... we're hungry.  The Server showed up, failed to identify himself and disappeared for 10 minutes.  Not very welcoming or professional, but we're here for the food, not to find quality staff. I ordered the Chick Piccata, one of their ""specialties"", according to their menu.  Fairly simple, right?  Apparently not. The pasta was stone cold.   It wouldn't have been a big deal to send it back, but it took over 10 minutes for our ""server"" to show up and ask ""how's everything"".   When he finally did show up, I sent the Chicken Picatta back.  Within 10 minutes, I was served another dish of Chicken Piccata, by someone I presume to be a ""manager"".   No comment from the manager, she just delivered the meal. It was hot this time, except the Pasta was under-done by a lot ... it wasn't edible. The Chicken Picatta was in a word, disgusting.  The chicken was boiled, not pan cooked.   The sauce was an awful concoction of I'm not sure what.  Traditional Chicken Piccata should have a lemon/butter/caper/mushroom sauce.  This had some weird, white sauce, that tasted and looked like it was made with milk or some such liquid.  I had 3 bites of the chicken and gave up. Starving, I figured I need a dessert to fill me up.  The chocolate tuxedo cheesecake was great, but I wanted to have a cup of coffee to help wash it down.  Coffee is about the most basic beverage to serve and Cheesecake Factory couldn't even deliver the goods when it came to a cup of coffee. The decaf coffee I was served was cold and must have been at least 4 hours old.  My spoon would almost stand up by itself, when I put in the cup.  I asked for ""cream & sugar"" and I was served a small aluminum pitcher of what I suspect, was either milk or some reconstituted coffee lightener.  I took one sip of the coffee and nearly spit it across the table.  I hope after I left, they saved the coffee to use as a solvent to clean their floors, rather than waste it. The Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake was excellent. In retrospect, the next time I'm hungry at the Burlington Mall, perhaps I'll just go to the Food Court, spent $5 there for some fast food and then go to Cheesecake Factory to get a dessert ""to go"".    I'd save $50 and not have to go home hungry. How this restaurant chain is so successful, baffles me.  I guess it proves that most diners will eat dirt on a shingle and like it, as long as they're served a decent size portion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington?start=80,3.4,3.48,3.48,2.9840000000000004,3.4480000000000004

We've attempted to go to the Cheesecake Factory on other occasions, but the lines always stretched to the entrance of the mall.  We were served warm bread and butter as we waited. All four of us got iced tea and lemonade because of the free refills. My boyfriend got 5 refills on his raspberry lemonade. The waiter was very attentive. We ordered the Southern Fried Chicken Sliders as an appetizer and they were so delicious and amazing! I liked it more than my actual meal. I ordered the California Cheese Steak and my boyfriend got the Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger. He raved about the thick cut, slow roasted bacon on his burger. I tried some and it really just melts in your mouth. None of us had room for dessert afterwards, which was sad 'cause we were at the Cheesecake Factory! When they boxed up our food, we each got a complimentary cup of iced tea or lemonade (depending on what we ordered) to go!  Overall, the atmosphere was nice and the service was fantastic!

You will see an array of salads and 'healthy' type apps and entrees on the menu, but if you are like me, you and your dining compadres will order all the things that will make you feel absolutely disgusted with yourself when you leave. For instance, the fried mac and cheese balls drenched in marinara sauce, or the avocado egg rolls... or the sweet corn tamale cakes! Delicious. Sure that Chinese chicken salad may look a little safer, but then you see that egg roll sampler drift by your table, and your mind is back to the fried Mac and cheese balls!

Instead of leaning in closer, he made us practically yell out our orders to him. He did this every single time, when ordering both drinks & food. When my brother ordered his meal of Baja Tacos and a side of fries, the waiter said verbatim: ""Are you sure you want the fries as well? The Baja tacos are the biggest item on the menu."" When my sister asked for basil in her Farfalle w/ chicken and roasted garlic pasta, he said, ""Adding basil to the pasta won't make it taste good - some dishes aren't meant for it."" and insisted she should order something else. If someone wants basil, and you can do it, I wouldn't recommend arguing against it.

We ordered the artichoke dip and clarified that we did NOT want the spinach dip. What did we get?  The spinach dip. So, we sent it back given that warm spinach activates the hub's gag reflex. The waitress came back and said the artichoke dip was seasonal and wasn't being offered. Okay, but it was still on the menu, so..... No artichoke dip for us. Fine. On to the meal.

Seating does not lend itself to privacy or conversation. It's a bit of a cattle farm. Service was slow..ordered soup for appetizer ..had to remind waiter . It came just a few minutes before our dinner. Very hot...ended up taking it home. Dinners came and mine really wasn't hot. Some of vegetables had that out of a can taste and appearance. Couple next to us also complained about the speed of service with their waiter.

82,Kirk T.,"Methuen, MA",45,14,2.0,2.0,2017-04-02,"Now in my 30s I remember that The Cheesecake Factory stood out as my first experience with exceptional customer service and attention to detail. I suspect those two things now get lost somewhere between the front of the house and the kitchen. Two of us dined there Friday night as I was feeling nostalgic and wanted to relive my teens again. Our server was funny, attentive, and super considerate. Our bread, drinks, and appetizers were awesome and arrived one time. The problem was that one of our entrees, a Chicken Marsala, appeared to have been cooked at some earlier point in the day, sat around for a while, and was reheated before service to us. The pasta was dry, the chicken had the rubbery reheated feel to it, and was just disappointing. My fiancé is rather shy and waited a bit before saying anything, but it was obvious that the pasta was dry and the kitchen should have never put the plate out. We were offered something else but declined as we just decided to share my entree.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington?start=80,2.96,3.34,3.284,2.7280000000000006,3.188

9,Lila S.,"Hubbardston, MA",253,422,277.0,3.0,2017-05-10,"What hasn't been said about Cheesecake Factory: Slow Slow Slow Service - No matter what location, or what time of day, its either packed and understaffed or dead and grossly understaffed.  The menu is large., .. too large overwhelming and for newbies can be a challenge to pick one thing.  Some items are misleading and mediocre - Example - Cajun Pasta claims to have a rich sauce - its thin, and buttery/oily and not very spicy.  The Shepards pie is... just NOT shepherds pie..  Portions and sides used to be larger and more exciting.?( no more wasabi mashed potatoes )  Quality of the food- Good but has been better The best feature is a small take home, already frozen PLAIN cheesecake with strawberries. They get too melty to take home in slices or fresh. Frozen is just perfect and the smaller one ($50) is more densely loaded with crumb topping. The drinks are good but so lightly prepared its not worth the $12 for a mai tai or long island. ..  It looks beautiful but the decor is so all over the place in theme and texture it can be nauseating (though I do love the wicker chairs outside) and the lighting inside at night is so so so dim I have to use my cell phone flashlight to read the menu.

Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken - delicious, cooked perfectly. Mashed potatoes and green beans were good. The sauce was slightly oily but very tasty.  Carne steak medallions - very good, cooked as asked with a great flavor Mac and Cheese app- 14 and 16 Y/O got this as meal, son was able to finish but not daughter. Both loved it. Pork Chops- very good Drinks - small wine list, got one drink and it was below average Value to Food - We averaged $40 a head with three teenagers and two adults. One wine glass and one drink... two of the kids got only an app and a cheesecake.  The prices are so high that if I had to wait more than half hour I could see the stars start to come down....

Beav & I stuck to Lemonade, which came with a nice sugar rim on the glass. Danny, our waiter was very nice & brought out good crusty bread. The boys packed up their extra food & each of them got a cheesecake piece for dessert later packed to go. CON-My shrimp scampi was unusual & not in a good way. Came with five decent sized but kinda mushy shrimp displayed on the sides of the giant plate with a scoop of angel hair pasta in the middle. There were whole roasted cloves of garlic scattered around & some (I think) candied pecans(?) in the sauce that gave a weirdly sweet taste to the whole dish. I had to ask for some lemon slices to give it any kind of lemon taste. I ate it, but wouldn't order it again. The place is decorated with that ""Old Italian Church Fresco Ceiling"" look, cheesy for sure. SO-I guess two outta three ain't bad, the boys liked it, but I won't be voting to go back anytime soon.

24,J B.,"Nashua, NH",0,8,2.0,1.0,2017-06-16,"The Good:  Arrived at 4:30 for early dinner and were seated immediately.  The Food:  Three out of four dishes were reported as very good.  The fourth had obviously completed it's cooking process early and ""waited"" for the rest of the order as it had cooled to room temp when served - very disappointing.   The Bad:  Due to our early arrival, the place was very quiet. With that, our food took exceptionally long to reach the table after ordering.  Additionally, upon arrival, I had not entirely settled into my seat and noticed one of my Forks was coated with food debris.  My wife also noticed her knife was filthy dirty. The waitress was quick to replace our utensils with much apology.  Unfortunately this was not the last issue with silverware; with arrival of desert, my wife immediately dropped her spoon realizing it too was caked with leftover, hardened food - we grabbed a pic of it this time. A discussion with the Manager yielded a free piece of cheesecake.  Exiting the restaurant, we all wondered just how clean the rest of the silverware actually was - so far no illness but this drops my review to one-star without hesitation. Conclusion:  I've been to other Cheesecake Factory locations and they have been great experiences.  Late and cold food, coupled with highly suspect cleanliness makes me seriously question whether I'll revisit this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington?start=20,3.56,3.33,3.316,2.372,3.422

Restaurant is nice, clean and a good size. The reason for the 2 stars is on the way out I decided to get a single slice of cheesecake from the take out counter, well that single piece of cheesecake took 12 minutes from the time I paid to the time I got it. Outrageous. There were about 5 or 6 ppl behind the counter but there didn't seem to be a rush. A lot of desserts getting prepped for tables and it seems the take out customers are neglected.

5,Luana F.,"Westminster, CA",574,76,175.0,5.0,2017-12-19,"Never have any issues when I come here. Of course it's usually a long wait especially on the weekends but I don't mind! The brunch menu and food are sooooo goood! I am still trying a lot of their menu options but it's hard since I sometimes want to get the same thing over and over again. My favorites are buffalo blast (app) (HUGE) Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Chicken Belagio, Thai lettuce wrap and the bacon bacon burger !! Those are some of my faves. And as if this visit I have two new favorites. Avocado Eggrolls and the herb crusted filet of salmon! So amazing. Our waitress was really nice I'm not sure why people complain about a big menu. Everything is so good you can't go wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington,2.84,3.21,3.284,,3.062
10,Adam M.,"Nashua, NH",225,206,269.0,3.0,2017-12-20,"If you've been to one  Cheesecake Factory, you've been to them all.  The menu is consistent and the preparation is formulaic.  Its always good and filling, but borderline on value.  The main issue is the seating.  The host desk can best be described as ""Town square in during hurricane with an earthquake thrown in for fun""  It's a mass of confusion and chaos.  I honestly think you could walk in and sit down and NOBODY would notice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington,2.84,3.19,3.276,,3.05
6,Domenico Domenic Chelmsford G.,"Chelmsford, MA",129,70,1.0,3.0,2017-12-27,I used to love this place.... They don't take reservations.  There is seating in bar area. You  are quoted a twenty minute wait but it can be an hour.  What perplexes me  is there are always plenty of empty tables. The staf f is average at best.  I often get their Louisiana Chicken Pasta.  They give you a lot of chicken.  It's actually a good meal to split with an extra side of pasta and some side salads. The cheesecake was good but took it to go.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington,2.92,3.2,3.276,,3.0880000000000005
2,Alexandra C.,"Boston, MA",560,715,739.0,2.0,2017-12-27,"Using a Christmas gift card helped. If I had been paying for this meal out of my own pocket, I would have been disappointed.  Firstly, prepare to wait at all times of the day. We were quoted a twenty minute wait at 4 PM and there were plenty of empty tables. The hostesses are rude too. My buzzer went off and she grabbed it and said ""stand over there"" while flailing her arm to the left. Um where? I had to ask someone else because she avoided me after that. We were seated and then forgotten about for over ten minutes. The people next to us got drinks, bread, and made an appetizer order before we even met our waitress. Our bread came out five minutes before our food. Great. Then the waitress we never saw said goodbye and was swapped for another waitress we never saw. I was surprised to see that they have some breakfast all day selections, one of my favorite things in the whole world.  What we got: Farm Fresh Eggs ($7.95)- This was two eggs served with an English muffin and your choice of potatoes or tomatoes. I chose tomatoes. It was good and I didn't feel disgustingly full after I ate it. Louisiana Chicken Pasta ($17.95)- This was parmesan-encrusted chicken served over pasta, peppers, onions, and mushrooms with Spicy New Orleans Sauce. I tried the pasta and it was good, although they gave him five pieces of chicken and a tiny bit of pasta. He's a big guy and he said that was way too much chicken for him; he would have preferred more pasta than the little serving he got rather than wasting all that chicken. Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake ($8.95)- Ugh, I was expecting greatness and this missed the mark. This cheesecake was hard and the cookie dough layer in the middle was rock hard. I had my spoon and I was pushing down with all my might to go through the slice and get a bite and I couldn't do it. He had to take a knife and slice it in half so I could even try to get a bite. It was almost as if the slice had been in the freezer and it hadn't be able to thaw long enough. Huge disappointment. And for a piece of cake that was priced higher than my meal. Go figure. Forty dollars and some change for mediocre food and lackluster service. It was a typical chain restaurant experience. I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington,2.92,3.17,3.276,,3.07

I have never sent food back but my steak was over cooked, not only did the waitress immediately and respectfully replace my meal she offered me a salad while I waited. Then the manager came over to personally apologize. This, mind you, was all during a lunch rush.  This has always been our go-to for snowy days, but now how could I go to another Cheesecake Factory?!? 5-stars!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington,2.96,3.21,3.288,,3.11

I don't understand how it takes more than 15 minutes to put cheesecake in a box. If the cheesecake wasn't so good I wouldn't come back, but the cheesecake is so damn good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington,2.92,3.2,3.284,,3.0880000000000005
4,Leena P.,"Lowell, MA",3,5,2.0,1.0,2018-01-08,"BUG IN MY DRINK  After receiving our appetizer, It took a whole 45 minutes until we received our food. By that time, our appetites were gone and the food was not hot. The best part was finding a FRUIT FLY inside my boyfriends strawberry lemonade. After informing the waitress she quickly brought it over to her manager without an apology. The manager, a middle aged Asian women came over to apologize and asked if we would like a cup to go..... I was SHOCKED. She said no more after I declined and never once came back to check up on us. The $3 drink was taken off the bill. Considering the fact that there was a bug with WINGS inside our drink and the only thing done was take It off the bill with a petty apology was beyond me. I will never come back to this establishment. Im afraid of what I might see in my food so PLEASE CHECK YOUR FOOD BEFORE CONSUMING.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington,2.8,3.19,3.28,,3.034

We sat at a booth and were treated with courtesy.  The waitress was nice to us. Food was good and never disappoints. I give it a four stars, it takes a long time to go thru their menu. It's too confusing. Lunch should have only lunch proportions and same with dinner and breakfast.
