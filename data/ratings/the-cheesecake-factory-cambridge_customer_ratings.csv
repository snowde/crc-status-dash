672,Chelle C.,"Cambridge, United States",17,48,33.0,4.0,2012-01-08,"I have always been a fan of The Factory, I even used to work there (long after my love affair began).  I definitely prefer sitting at the dinner table to eat over serving... hands down! I don't know if my love for this place brings me good karma when it comes to getting good food and service but I have never had a problem here. Even though my taste in food continues to grow, this place never disappoints me.  There really is something for everyone... you just need to find the right dish- ...though, the menu can sometimes be overwhelming and it would be helpful if they had pics on the menu...  Now a days I get the Grilled Salmon with Spinach and depending on my needs either nutritional or comfort I will either get broccoli or mashed potatoes... this week, I needed some comfort, so mashed potatoes it was ... and they were actually creamier than usual (but still thick) which made it even better...!!!  So kudos to the chef too.  They also gave a good portion of spinach.  Sometimes that have skimped on that in the passed... but not Monday night!   They also agreed to give my friend the lunch portion instead of the full sized meal at the lunch price...  I forgot how much they try to please. anyway... And when I have a good server, I definitely have to Yelp about it!! Marissa... you rock!  You were polite, personable, knowledgeable and fun! And even recommended the New Oreo Cheesecake... which I got because it was National Cheesecake Day and it was half off... it was fabulous!  Thanks for the suggestion. If anyone needs suggestions of meal ideas I am happy to help you choose something that fits your desire... I am not kidding when I say I love this place. LOL... the only think I missed about working there was 50% off on meals and free meals on a double shift!  :) Anyway, go and enjoy... even if only for cheesecake and coffee, they have a good strong coffee for coffee lovers!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=180,3.36,2.94,2.94,2.9280000000000004,3.108
683,Alain T.,"Orange County, United States",141,364,921.0,1.0,2012-01-10,"The review is based strictly on the service.  My hotel happened to be across from this restaurant and decided to eat here on our first night. I've been to other Cheesecake restaurants in the past and their food has always been consistent and above average. However, the service in this restaurant is horrendous. The waiter has no business working here as he completely lacked customer service skills. He completely ignored our party for most of the night. Never came for refills, kept forgetting what we had ordered for dinner. Acted completely aloof and generally a total ass to our party. Terrible job and definitely lost my business my next visit in town.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=240,3.36,2.92,2.92,2.5320000000000005,3.096

WTF are fried mac n' cheese balls?), Baja chicken tacos, BBQ salmon, etc. all from the same place, I am overwhelmed and even turned off by the sheer number of choices.  After all, if the cooks need to maintain that huge of a repertoire, how are they possibly going to do them well?  There is a very good reason why the best of the best restaurants only offer a few items on the menu.  I'm not saying TCF has to be best of the best, but some restraint would be welcome.  Even more of a turn-off than the long menu are the full page advertisements on every other page of said menu.  Cheesecake F. presents itself as a classy date gig--but it really isn't that classy to pick out your Chicken Madeira while simultaneously discovering the best place to get hair electrolysis.  Stay classy, TCF.  You really know how to set the dining mood.

As a new Yelper, I try not to review these big box joints because everyone knows about them and can make their own judgement about whether or not they're going to eat there. 2.) I really don't like this place and I don't know why I keep going back!! That all being said, the food is good and pretty consistent among the 3 or 4 different stores I've been to. The prices are outrageous and definitely not worth it. The cheesecake is just okay. I've had so much better and I hate that they have so many to choose from. As a matter of fact, I hate that the menu is as large as it is. It's annotying to have to flip through so many food choices and a lot of them look the same. The service... I've actually decided to write this review because of my last experience here. I came with a group of maybe 10 or more and everyone ordered a lot of food. Our server was nice though she left us hanging for awhile - be it to take our order, bring our bread, refill water, ask how we're doing, etc. She was nice to us and I know large groups can get crazy. Our entrees were starting to come out and the guy bringing them out was the biggest dick I've ever seen. He came over and screamed with an attitude that the plate was hot so don't touch it, okay?! Condesendingly he said, 'okay?!' again. As we were trying to make room for our food, he was yelling that we had to move more plates out of the way if we wanted our food, he rolled his eyes, snarled, yelled about moving more things out of the way, and slammed things down onto the table. As one of my friend's was moving a plate, he sntached it out of her hand and moved it himself.  I really wish I had said something, but I was having a good time with friends and didn't want to ruin our evening. As I was driving to the restaurant, I saw this guy smoking near the loading dock  on the side of the mall and thought about how disgusting it was to see him smoking right on the street. I knew he worked there from the white gear (anyone know why they have to wear ALL white?? That's gross, too) and hoped he wouldn't be our server.

163,John G.,"Boston, MA",295,26,,1.0,2012-07-09,"My friend and I went to The Cambridge Side Galleria Cheesecake Factory for lunch on her birthday.  Our drinks took 20 minutes to receive and we were the ONLY two sitting in the bar area and the restaurant was dead. The server was a tall gay guy who spend most of his time gossiping with the bar tender about how much he loves to give head. I am gay, so I don't mind that he is gay,  but I did not need to hear about how this Mary gives head. The thought of his lip-gloss anyway near me makes me want to vomit.

Even though my taste in food continues to grow, this place never disappoints me.  There really is something for everyone... you just need to find the right dish- ...though, the menu can sometimes be overwhelming and it would be helpful if they had pics on the menu...  Now a days I get the Grilled Salmon with Spinach and depending on my needs either nutritional or comfort I will either get broccoli or mashed potatoes... this week, I needed some comfort, so mashed potatoes it was ... and they were actually creamier than usual (but still thick) which made it even better...!!!  So kudos to the chef too.  They also gave a good portion of spinach.  Sometimes that have skimped on that in the passed... but not Monday night!   They also agreed to give my friend the lunch portion instead of the full sized meal at the lunch price...  I forgot how much they try to please. anyway... And when I have a good server, I definitely have to Yelp about it!! Marissa... you rock!  You were polite, personable, knowledgeable and fun! And even recommended the New Oreo Cheesecake... which I got because it was National Cheesecake Day and it was half off... it was fabulous!  Thanks for the suggestion. If anyone needs suggestions of meal ideas I am happy to help you choose something that fits your desire... I am not kidding when I say I love this place.

This is one of those places that people probably aren't using yelp for unless they've been frozen in carbonite for the last 20 years because these days kids come out of the womb knowing what the Cheesecake Factory is.  Why this place is packed all the time is beyond me...well it probably has something to do with the massive portions, infinitely long menu, and saccharine drinks. Would I bring a date here? Hell no--it has about as much personality as a boiled ham.  Would I go here if a bunch of people all wanted to get dinner but were each insistent on pizza, pasta, Chinese, classic American, Southern, etc and all want it to taste exactly the same? Yes, I would.  The menu is like a compendium of food that has existed around the world and throughout time.  Its 21 pages of random things that people may or may not have thrown together after getting stoned. Food: 21 pages of chicken.  Goddamn people must eat a lot of chicken.  When I went here with my Dad he got a cajun pasta and I got what they told me was ""their take"" on chicken parm.  How someone has a take on chicken parm is beyond me, if you make chicken parm, its chicken parm, end of story.  Anyways, both of your dishes tasted exactly the same, but you should expect that from a place which is loved by soccer moms the world over.  When I went with friends I had a burger (doesn't matter which one since they all taste the same) and an order of the guacamole...which the waiter said we could get extra spicy, so we did.  The guac was quite possibly the least spicy thing ever conceived by man.  The burger was huge and cooked to order so I can't complain about that, though it's probably more food than should be in a person at a time.  I had the pineapple upside-down cheesecake, which turned out to be one of the worse decisions I've made as of late (and trust me, I've made some bad decisions lately).  Their super dense cheesecake sandwiched between two cold blocks of cake with the density of diamonds.  Oh, if you're curious, look up the calories for the dishes...you won't be that surprised. Drinks: I asked the waitress if I could get a Gimlet and she gave me a look like I told her the ending to Titanic.  So I decided to stick to the menu.  The Firefly, long island, and the mojitos are incredibly sweet, so if you actually like the taste of your liquor, then hold off. Service: Amazing service.  Way to go 20 year old girl and guy with awesome hair who's been there for 7 years, you're what made this place awesome for me.  The waiters can take you front to back then front again through the menu while blindfolded and lit on fire.

You will definitely get your moneys worth.  I'd recommend the bang bang chicken and shrimp, chicken Bellagio, miso salmon, bbq salmon and Chinese chicken salad as the best entrees.  Recently, I went and they had a lemon caper salmon special which was very good.  So much so, that I asked the waiter if  this would be added to the menu.  He advised that it is something that they can make, even if they don't list it as a special.  If you love salmon, then I'd recommend this dish.  In fact, all of their salmon dishes are real good. The avocado egg rolls and buffalo blasts are also great appetizers.    The alcohol drinks always seem watered down so I don't even bother ordering a drink here anymore.  This place is really not for a fine dining experience.  It is a family friendly and casual restaurant.  If you want a relatively inexpensive meal, huge portions and great dessert (cheesecake) then this is a good place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=120,3.12,2.96,2.92,2.604,3.0240000000000005

The menu was extensive, but somehow it didn't seem as overwhelming this time around.  There were so many things that sounded good, it was difficult to pick one thing for dinner.   I settled on the Chinese Chicken Salad and it was fantastic.  My son had the fish tacos and he polished them off quickly.  My husband enjoyed the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. I ended the meal with a yummy chocolate cake and my son had the strawberry shortcake.   Our waitress was very good.  She was upbeat, and attentive without being annoying.  The restaurant is noisy, but we were seated in a booth near the kitchen and it felt like we were sort of in an insulated area.

I ordered a  Tropical Smoothie which consisted of  mango, passion fruit, pineapple, coconut and ice. It had a thick consistency so it came with a wide straw. The Tropical Smoothie was garnished with strawberry, lime slice, and orange slice. For appetizers, we shared the Avocado Egg Rolls which consisted of avocado and red peppers in wonton skin and deep fried. The Avocado Egg Rolls came with sweet tamarind-cashew sauce, over a bed of crispy white noodles, garnished with grated fresh parsley.

When a restaurant deserves only one star despite serving above-average food, either the service, location, or prices are exceptionally unreasonable. Here, it's the service. THREE confirmations of a single reservation for 30 people were insufficient to convince the manager that the customer really values the reservation, and highly respects the restaurant, knowing how popular and busy it can be. Over the phone, the manager promised 2 tables of 15, only to split us into 4 tables of unequal size all over the restaurant. Actions speak louder than words; how the inability to honor such a concept earned the manager his position is utterly revealing of the restaurant's leadership. Arrogance and complacency do overshadow respect for the customer - this restaurant is an epitome of that. Alas, as long as the business continues to thrive with small groups, such a spacious restaurant will ironically need miracles to properly handle large groups.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=80,2.28,2.83,2.94,3.108,2.6100000000000003

The soup was great, the salad was huge but unappealing as it was mostly mixed greens drowning in dressing with a few tomatoes. The chicken salad sandwich was not really like chicken salad, it was large chunks of chicken in a mayo sauce with lettuce and tomato. It tasted better later when I ate the second half open faced (I fed the bread to some geese) because I could taste the almonds much better. I got the salted caramel cheesecake and it was fantastic!

When a restaurant deserves only one star despite serving above-average food, either the service, location, or prices are exceptionally unreasonable. Here, it's the service. THREE confirmations of a single reservation for 30 people were insufficient to convince the manager that the customer really values the reservation, and highly respects the restaurant, knowing how popular and busy it can be. Over the phone, the manager promised 2 tables of 15, only to split us into 4 tables of unequal size all over the restaurant. Actions speak louder than words; how the inability to honor such a concept earned the manager his position is utterly revealing of the restaurant's leadership.

We never did get a refill on our sodas, we asked for our meals to be boxed up. He brought out two boxes and a bag to us, we boxed up our own leftovers.  He then picked up the leftovers at the table behind us and boxed those up in the kitchen for them, and presented them to the couple.  The place was empty, he wasn't busy, the server had three tables with two people at each table. He blatantly ignored us, we normally order coffee and cheesecake after, but we'd already been there for two hours and decided that it wasn't worth the wait.

I got the four-cheese gluten-free pasta, and my wife the breakfast omelette. Both plates had a decent taste, but portions were smaller than I'd expected. Not unreasonably so, but normally pasta dishes are pretty sizable because well, they cost nothing to make. Afterwards, we got the only gluten-free cheesecake, which was also good. I would give three stars for this, however there were two main issues. The first was that out waiter said basically nothing, and kinda seemed upset in general? Maybe he was having a bad day, but it was pretty weird. He wasn't unfriendly, just... intensely quiet. He was good about refilling drinks though. The other big issue is that several times during brunch they were doing something that was either vacuuming or blendering or whatever, but it was so loud that I couldn't hear my wife, who was sitting 3 feet away, over the sound of it for several minutes.

I got the basil shrimp pasta, and it was a little tasteless. I had to drown it a little in black pepper to taste good. Apps were YUMMY! Fried mac and cheese balls, avocado egg rolls, and calamari were all delicious. Seriously...next time i'll just get an appetizer for a meal. I got the pineapple moscow mule for a cocktail, and it was nice. Cheesecake was the salted caramel one, which I took half home for hubby bear.

I got the basil shrimp pasta, and it was a little tasteless. I had to drown it a little in black pepper to taste good. Apps were YUMMY! Fried mac and cheese balls, avocado egg rolls, and calamari were all delicious. Seriously...next time i'll just get an appetizer for a meal. I got the pineapple moscow mule for a cocktail, and it was nice. Cheesecake was the salted caramel one, which I took half home for hubby bear.

The hostess was friendly and we only had to wait like 1 minute for seats.  Their menu has a wide selection of food. I ordered a cappuccino as it was cold that day (the cup was huge and it definitely warmed we up). We ordered crab wontons for appetizer and I was surprised it came in such a large portion size. Their breadsticks with butter was delicious (esp the brown bread). We ordered orange chicken and tomato basil pasta which were both delicious and worth the price as it came in huge portion.  Our waiter was friendly and checked in to see if everything was alright and constantly filled our glass with water. Our food came quickly and the presentation was great. Yes it's quite expensive but judging from the size it's worth it. I also suggest sharing food with your friends if you're on a tight budget. We started to get full and didn't get to order their famous cheesecake... But that's something to look forward to in the future.

Our server Eduardo came right away and served us drinks & bread. We ordered an app and two entrees plus a side of mashed potatoes. Everything arrived in good time except for the mashed potatoes. I was told it would be right out, then 5 min later was told they ran out and would take 20 minutes to make. I didn't mind because I was super desperate and craving mashed potatoes. I could wait.. i would have waited all night if I had to. 10 min later the manager came over and said it would take another 15 min. He apologized, made the mashed potatoes complimentary, and even made one of our entrees complimentary (I did not expect that at all!). We ordered the godiva cheesecake while we waited, then eduardo brought out hot and fresh mashed potatoes in a takeout container.. Not one, but TWO heaping portions! It was the highlight of my day.

I understand a lot if things being in the industry especially screwing things up from time to time but as a server you should know that kids eat first and as a manager you deliver the kids food yourself and either take the thing off the bill since you know it's been an hour for a kids pizza to come out and since you know your service is bad.

I ordered a cappuccino as it was cold that day (the cup was huge and it definitely warmed we up). We ordered crab wontons for appetizer and I was surprised it came in such a large portion size. Their breadsticks with butter was delicious (esp the brown bread). We ordered orange chicken and tomato basil pasta which were both delicious and worth the price as it came in huge portion.  Our waiter was friendly and checked in to see if everything was alright and constantly filled our glass with water. Our food came quickly and the presentation was great. Yes it's quite expensive but judging from the size it's worth it. I also suggest sharing food with your friends if you're on a tight budget. We started to get full and didn't get to order their famous cheesecake... But that's something to look forward to in the future.

Yes Yelitza ! You indeed forgot to pack my two cheese cakes :( Thanks for the response! Door dash was not at any fault for packaging my order. Door dash was to deliver my food . The point was I contacted the store & nothing was done . the item could of been re-deliver to me but it wasn't an option when asked , I could have picked up my cheesecakes on my way home from work. I even had the door dash delivery guy contact the store & even he told me the girl left him on hold. Poor customer service. Yes! I got my refund thanks to them !

12,Augie A.,"Woodstock, GA",0,3,2.0,1.0,2017-01-09,"In from Atlanta, staying at a nearby hotel (where I should have stuck to vending machine snacks for dinner, v. Eating here).  Called in my order.  Asked what sides come with what I was ordering (which was a combo of grilled salmon and shrimp scampi), I was told by the girl on the phone, ""mashed potatoes... and whatever comes with the salmon and whatever comes with the scampi"". Ha! I could have guessed two thirds of that response. I call the number from the curbside parking (as instructed on their website), no answer. Okay. I go in, pick it up and pay, including a 10% tip (it's take out), and I ask for utensils.  Get to my room (two minutes away), EVERY THING is swimming in some kind of cream sauce. Wrong order. There is shrimp and there is salmon, but clearly not what I ordered (check out the pic after I choked it down). And cold to boot. And I got two plastic forks. That's it.  Don't patronize this place.  I'm not hard to please, but this was a joke, if not a slap in the face. I guess $35.00 for take out dinner for one, doesn't warrant a little attention to detail.  Horrible. If I could give it zero stars, I would. UPDATE: Just spoke to the manager. He told me they get a lot of complaints about the combos and I should write a letter to corporate.

The waiter brought me bread with butter. I immediately informed him that I don't eat dairy products and that if they put it in my food I would send it back. I asked him to bring me olive oil. He said ""right away"".  I waited for several minutes and watched him wait on other tables and my bread grow cold. I looked at him as he walked by and he asked me about the weather and if it was still nice out. I reminded him about the olive oil. He had forgotten. Not long thereafter I was served the grilled salmon that I had ordered. It was quite raw in the center. I showed it to the waiter who said that they served their salmon medium rare. I repeated a few times as he kept saying that that it was served medium rare that it was raw. He took it back to the kitchen. The manager came out and said it was a mistake and that they would not knowingly serve their food that way. The waiter came by and said they would give me a fresh serving. I waited for a while. Out came salmon drenched in butter, not grilled, and with pesto sauce on it. I had ordered just plain grilled salmon as it is offered on the menu, with nothing on it, and grilled.  The manager returned and denied there was butter on it, said that it was grilled, just some oil from the pesto sauce (which pesto sauce, or butter, was not on my original order.

This time we only went for the cheesecake pick up (after calling in) - easy enough...you would think.  SO disappointed. Anybody who knows me knows I rarely give one star and (TRY) to be patient, but service was too bad this time. I called at exactly 5:30pm for a 6inch strawberry cheesecake and mentioned I will be there in 20 minutes. I ALSO double checked and made sure the cake can be ready for me to just grab and go - OK GREAT. (I know it's Saturday night and it gets super busy and I don't know what it takes to make a cheesecake. Mostly because I don't eat them and this was for a bday.)  We get there just past 6pm (so more than the 20 minute warning) and they say it's not ready and is being decorated, which will take 5-10 minutes. Okay...fine. So we pay the $35 (WOW, forgot how expensive they are) for the cake and wait. And wait...oh and wait...check in with them (""it's not ready yet"")...and wait. We then proceeded  to watch one of the ""bakers"" take a finished frozen cake out of the fridge to put on strawberries and frosting.... Please note that during this time, I was able to re-download Yelp (new phone! Yay), check in, and write this review. Yes, disappointed.  As Mama would say: If you can't estimate the timing, don't estimate. When you set the expectation, meet it. Please and thank you.

I was a waitress for years and normally try not to complain about service but it really made our time unpleasant. We had a younger girl as our waitress, didn't catch her name but it seemed as though she definitely did not want to be there and certainly didn't want us there either. Everything was fine in the beginning as she took our drink order and offered us bread. Once she brought those over we put in for an appetizer, the Thai chicken wraps which were good. When the appetizer was brought over she came over and immediately took the bread off the table which we had barely touched without asking which I thought was a little strange. We put in for the rest of our order when she brought the appetizer over. Fast forward to when we were done with the appetizer she came to clear the plates and left my dirty silverware on the table and instead took away the clean set. It was extremely awkward as she cleared the table as she seemed to just be aggressively throwing the silverware and plates onto the appetizer dish to clear up. Definitely wasn't getting a friendly or welcoming vibe from her whatsoever. Once our food came out, I got the Parmesan herb crusted chicken and my boyfriend got the teriyaki chicken, I had to ask the food runner for clean silverware as she had taken mine.

When asked if they would rather make a 85 year old with a walker and 2 crying/hungry kids wait then sit, we were told yes and there's nothing they would do. After finally getting sat, the drinks were extremely slow and not made correctly. I would not recommend this restaurant for anyone with a large group.

386,S P.,"Saugus, United States",0,4,,1.0,2017-03-30,"ATROCIOUS!!! Never have I ever had the worst dining experience in my entire life up until last night. Our waiter (JOHN) was the utmost disgusting, rudest, and pompous individual I have ever met. He never properly introduced himself when greeting us and never asked us what we wanted for beverages. Instead he assume we wanted water and bread without a peep out of his mouth. I kindly asked for lemon and before I was able to order a cocktail he cut me off and said ""sure, I'll get you lemon"" then quickly left. By that awkward moment my friend and I decided to just settle for water since clearly he couldn't let us order drinks.  When he came back with my lemon he asked us if we were ready to order. I was extremely frustrated, but bit my tongue and ordered. My friend requested if she could have the chicken Bellagio, but instead with the Louisiana chicken and his response ""So you want fried chicken..."" with an unwelcoming tone. This was uncalled for and instead of stating the obvious he could've addressed it politely and with no attitude that way we could of had a better understanding.  Instead of leaving or requesting a new server we decided to deal with his sour personality. We proceeded to order and got 2 appetizers and 1 entree . In the past the server normally asks us if we would like the order to come out together. This man was so quick to cut us off again that we never got a chance to even ask.  He came back to drop off appetizer plates and basically slammed it on our table. He came back to drop off the 2 appetizers and not once asked us how everything was. Then before the entree even arrived he didn't bother to pick up the unused dirty plates. Eventually I just stacked the plates together thinking he could take a hint. Correct me if I am wrong, but EVERY TIME I get pasta they offer parmesan, but no he didn't. We didn't even bother to ask and didn't want to hunt down our waiter who clearly doesn't want to be there.  We barely even spoke to him throughout the entire evening. Again, he never asked us how our entree was either. He came back to the table again to give us water when we didn't need it because our cups were practically full. My friend kindly said ""Sir, would you please remove these plates."" HE CUT HER OFF of course and said ""YEAH, CAN I GIVE YOU WATER FIRST CAN I DO THIS FIRST!"" I was at disbelief of what was going on and instead of grabbing the dirty plates he instead grabbed the appetizer plate with food still on it that we were STILL WORKING ON. I didn't know what he was mad about, but he took the blame on us. We were so upset we didn't even want to continue to talk to this man so we let him grab whatever he wanted that was in front of us.  At this point we couldn't take it anymore we were livid! He came back again and said to my friend ""Are you still working on that?"" mind you she didn't have a single thing on her plate. We knew he was being a sarcastic jerk. She said ""Well what am I working on there's nothing on my plate."" He didn't deserve a kind response so we gave him a little taste of his own medicine. He proceeds to ask if he can take it while being a smart alec.  Finally he called a manager for us so we could complain about the horrendous service. She asked us if everything was okay. Clearly not. Everything was far from okay. We explained to her what had happened. She asked if we wanted a different server and we said yes. We both came out for a nice dinner so we never let his poor service ruin our evening until the moment he decided to argue with us about removing the plates from before. Midway through the evening we still didn't even know his name. After speaking to the manager he didn't even bother to come and apologize. As we left we saw him laugh at us. He was not only a terrible server, but he's a bully who is clearly not right for hospitality. No one should ever have to endure or feel as horrible as this man made us feel.

I was surprised to see no host at the front for minutes and was amazed to find that there wasn't a wait time when I came in with my family to the restaurant and we were seated fairly quickly.  As we sat down the waitress told us the specials and took down our drinks, appetizers, and a request that we have only the honey wheat bread before she left.  The drinks were simple: iced tea, coke, water with lemon, strawberry lemonade, and buffalo wings. When the waitress returned several minutes later, she forgot we ordered all honey wheat; as well as my mother's lemon for her water. Then it turned out that they ran out of iced tea? So my father opted to order a strawberry lemonade as well after placing our main entrees and my brother realized his coke was flat. Right now, my father is still waiting on his soup; I re-ordered the lemon for my mother that has yet to arrive; and a table next to ours had gotten all honey wheat bread as well as their meal when we had gotten in 15 minutes before them (maybe that's me also being a bit bitter). Sitting in the dining area, I'm trying to remain optimistic that maybe there are hiccups within the kitchen and the rest of the dining staff, but it doesn't make much sense to me seeing as though there are also several open tables and that more than 30 minutes have already elapsed where I'm not presented with a meal and that there are still appetizer plates and an empty bread bowl that hadn't been taken away. Maybe about ~5-7 minutes after I finished writing my last statement the food came out and the waitress had a surprised look on her face when my father asked about his soup and she ran back to get it saying it was on its way. When she came back, we asked for a third time about the lemon, but said it was for the entree of a pan seared salmon and the Asian taco lettuce wraps. I ordered farfalle where bacon bits were burnt and it seemed as though the tomatoes were raw and simply cut and thrown into the dish. Then my brother's jambalaya pasta was drenched with a watery sauce. After ordering dessert, service improved, but by that point, I've already made my opinion on this location of the establishment.

It just took awhile to get to that point. I had the vegan Cobb salad and it was wicked good. Definitely surpassed my expectations.

And for goodness sake grow a sense of humor and don't act like a dead doorknob. Yes I had to get him to take It off and he finally did. But why should I have to call them out for their mistakes. It wasn't even busy. Grow up guys in Cheesecake Factory. And maybe just maybe you'll get better ratings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=40,2.2,2.31,2.736,,2.2660000000000005
422,Augie A.,"Woodstock, United States",0,3,2.0,1.0,2017-09-01,"In from Atlanta, staying at a nearby hotel (where I should have stuck to vending machine snacks for dinner, v. Eating here).  Called in my order.  Asked what sides come with what I was ordering (which was a combo of grilled salmon and shrimp scampi), I was told by the girl on the phone, ""mashed potatoes... and whatever comes with the salmon and whatever comes with the scampi"". Ha! I could have guessed two thirds of that response. I call the number from the curbside parking (as instructed on their website), no answer. Okay. I go in, pick it up and pay, including a 10% tip (it's take out), and I ask for utensils.  Get to my room (two minutes away), EVERY THING is swimming in some kind of cream sauce. Wrong order. There is shrimp and there is salmon, but clearly not what I ordered (check out the pic after I choked it down). And cold to boot. And I got two plastic forks. That's it.  Don't patronize this place.  I'm not hard to please, but this was a joke, if not a slap in the face. I guess $35.00 for take out dinner for one, doesn't warrant a little attention to detail.  Horrible. If I could give it zero stars, I would. UPDATE: Just spoke to the manager. He told me they get a lot of complaints about the combos and I should write a letter to corporate.  How about instead, I just never eat at ANY Cheesecake Factory, ever.  I hope potential investors read reviews... save your money folks!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge,2.04,2.31,2.728,,2.2020000000000004

The three adult meals had arrived and we waited 7 minutes for her pizza to arrive!  That's hard for a kid and there were no apologies from the staff. I had a cheeseburger on sourdough.  The burger didn't fit, made it messy and the burger was burnt! It wasn't really tasty and after waiting the 7 minutes for my daughters food, my fries were cold.  I have to say their desserts are AMAZING but I am not a fan of their food.

This time we only went for the cheesecake pick up (after calling in) - easy enough...you would think.  SO disappointed. Anybody who knows me knows I rarely give one star and (TRY) to be patient, but service was too bad this time. I called at exactly 5:30pm for a 6inch strawberry cheesecake and mentioned I will be there in 20 minutes. I ALSO double checked and made sure the cake can be ready for me to just grab and go - OK GREAT. (I know it's Saturday night and it gets super busy and I don't know what it takes to make a cheesecake. Mostly because I don't eat them and this was for a bday.)  We get there just past 6pm (so more than the 20 minute warning) and they say it's not ready and is being decorated, which will take 5-10 minutes. Okay...fine. So we pay the $35 (WOW, forgot how expensive they are) for the cake and wait. And wait...oh and wait...check in with them (""it's not ready yet"")...and wait. We then proceeded  to watch one of the ""bakers"" take a finished frozen cake out of the fridge to put on strawberries and frosting.... Please note that during this time, I was able to re-download Yelp (new phone! Yay), check in, and write this review. Yes, disappointed.  As Mama would say: If you can't estimate the timing, don't estimate. When you set the expectation, meet it. Please and thank you.
