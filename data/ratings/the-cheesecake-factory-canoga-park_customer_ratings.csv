I always tell myself i'm gonna try something new every time I come here but I end up just getting the Jambalya!  I can say that I've tried all their appetizers though.  My favorite is the Spinach Artichoke Dip.  This appetizer goes great with the complimentary bread (one's whole grain and the other french bread).  The portions are huge and can easily be shared between two people, if not, it makes a great lunch or dinner the next day.   Next, yes I have to say is the dessert! Don't bother with all their other stuff like lava cakes or apple pies because everything's all about, just guess.. THE CHEESECAKE!!! My all time favorite is between Tiramisu and Vanilla Bean -- these are just to die for.  I've had their other ones from the red velvet to caramel chocolate one but for me i'd rather get my usual.  All the cheesecake is delicious and mouthwatering, enough said.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=440,3.52,3.52,3.52,3.536,3.5200000000000005

We had all sorts of goodies from the avocado rolls to the strawberry cheesecake! Every dish that came to the table was simply fantastic! I ordered my favorite dish chicken n biscuits mmm delish!! The strawberry lemonade is soo tasty they even add salt on the rim of the glass. Our waiter for the night was cool and was on top of his game very attentive and made sure all of our requests were taken care of! Even the hostess that took us to our table was super chill :)  It was a super cool night we got seated outside it was nice tented, with the heaters on and the vibe with all the other folks around was good :)  If you park in the structure located behind the building make sure to take your ticket with you so it can get validated!!

729,Angelina M.,"Glendale, CA",27,35,,3.0,2012-01-26,"I dine here last night with a friend. The service was OK - our waiter seemed a little confused. Instead of red wine, I got white wine, instead of brown rice - white rice (even though we specified brown)... And at the end of the meal he asked us if we wanted to box the left-overs, we said ""yes"", he disappear for 15 min, then came out again and asked the same question. Perhaps he was overwhelmed, because it was a busy night. Food: Avocado rolls - 5 stars! Beets and goad cheese salad would benefit from more beets, there were just a few small cubes... Ahi tuna (I ordered it as a main course, not appetizer) was supposed to be accompanied with wasabi sauce, so I expected it to be a little spicy and flavorful. However, the fish was bland and the amount of sauce, sprinkled around it was so miniscule, that it wasn't enough to add flavor to the dish. My recommendation is - add more sauce or marinade the fish in something that has a taste.  Overall experience - good, but needs improvement.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=720,3.6,3.29,3.29,3.436,3.414

716,Jarrod M.,"San Diego, CA",18,43,3.0,3.0,2012-03-11,"While I really like Cheesecake, I have definitely had better experiences. This particular location is very popular and being located in a corporate area like Warner Center, a lot of professionals frequent this restaurant. Parking is not as convenient as it would be if this were a stand alone location, but that's not really the restaurant's fault. The lobby is enormous, as is the rest of this location. As is the Cheesecake custom, they have the desserts staring at you from behind the brightly lit display cases just as you come in. Getting to your table can be a trek, due to the shear size of this place. They certainly pack the tables close together, which, unless you get a booth, makes you feel as if you are sharing a meal with other diners next to you. I have always found the tables themselves far too small for all the stuff they try to cram on there- silverware, glasses, bread basket, bread plates, etc.  This particular trip was not the greatest due to our lack of a server for the first 10 or so minutes after we sat down. When our server finally did arrive, though, he was pleasant and attentive enough. Our food took a while also, which I can understand due to how busy it was. The food itself is always good and portion sizes are more than adequate. When we were ready for our bill, we had to wait again to see our server for a while. I normally try not to rate too harshly on one element alone, but this time, I just didn't enjoy it as much because of the extremely slow service.

Most of my friends are too chicken to drive a little further out to experience new restaurants, so they just stick to what they know.  I've seriously tried like almost everything on their menu.

We ordered a bottle of champagne , which was brought to us and the bottle was sat directly on the table, not in a champage bucket. My first champagne glass was dirty so I requested another one which still was dirty. All of our eating utencils where not wrapped in a napkin but sat directly on the table which were also dirty.  I finally decided to speak with a manager. His response to me for  why the dishes and glasses were dirty was that , "" Our dish water has to be changed every two hours or else all of the dishes will be washed with dirty water. Sometimes our employees dont change the water so this is why your dishes were dirty."" Why would you tell a customer that?  He did not apologize but he did say , "" Thankyou for letting me know because that may be what our other customers think."" I went back to my table and canceled my food. Why would I eat at a place who washed their dishes with dirty water?  Another manager came over and asked me what happend.

I've been eating at Cheesecake Factory for over 15 years, and this is the second time I received horrible service.  Once in San Francisco and now here in Woodland Hills. I was told on slower nights the service at Cheesecake Factory is bad. So, the tip is going during typically busy times of the day and receive the excellent service you can expect at Cheesecake Factory. This is probably the last time I would choose to eat at this location. I now prefer the Sherman Oaks location over this one as I have had consistently great service. I usually go to Cheesecake Factory for a dependable menu that can please any palate. So big groups are great  to bring at the Cheesecake. Our server hardly paid any attention to us and didn't refill our drinks. He didn't  remember when we stated it was our nephews 7th birthday dinner. We had to remind him that he wanted to blow out a candle on his cheesecake. He also messed up on our order -- forgot our order of crabcakes and gave us a double order of the ahi appetizer and even charged us for it for his screw up.

508,Andrew M.,"Berkeley, CA",16,90,,4.0,2012-11-24,"It's The Cheesecake Factory, if you've been to one you've been to all of them. The amazing thing is the consistency. Literally hundreds of dishes on the menu, granted a lot of them use the same ingredients, but it's surprising that one kitchen can turn all of this out so efficiently and consistently.  Also amazing? Not only that the kitchen can turn out hundreds of different dishes a night, but that most of them can actually be good. In a way The Cheesecake Factory is kind of the Styx or Abba of the culinary world. Nobody wants to pay them much respect but everyone still secretly likes them. Where else can you go for this kind of cheesy opulence and still get a consistently well cooked piece of salmon? Its the culinary version of a casino in Vegas, proud of how shallow it is, admitting that it's not really trying for any kind of authenticity in anything it does, but cranking out a polished simulacrum of the culture that it's trying to ape. Could I ever confuse the Venetian in Vegas for the canals of Venice? Never in a million years, but it has its own thing going on and that has value in its own right. Huge portions, larger than any human should be allowed to eat are served with flagrant disregard for calorie counts or actual nutritive value. Due to Los Angeles law, a separate sheet with calorie counts is brought out with your menu, but if you're coming here you really shouldn't even think about counting calories. Really, even if you do care about calories, you shouldn't look at this sheet, because it's just going to cause guilt and shame afterwards. Yes, your entree is going to be between 2100 and 3100 calories, so skip the appetizer. Really, I'd be shocked if you can have a couple of drinks, an entree and a dessert here and get out for under 4k calories.  The Skinnilicious menu doesn't have anything you'd actually want to eat on it so don't even look at it.  Really, The Cheesecake Factory straddles that line of ""I'm totally only enjoying this ironically"" and ""I'm actually totally enjoying this"" so well that it's best not to analyze it, and besides, does it actually matter? Either way you're having a good time. Most of the cheesecakes are too sweet though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=500,3.6,3.46,3.46,3.696,3.5160000000000005

This restaurant gets busy and there's almost always a wait. The workers though are usually friendly, I've always had a pleasant dining experience here.  Servers have always been most attentive and most informed. On a scale of 1-10 on loudness in the restaurant, I'd give it a 8.5.  It's near impossible to enjoy an intimate dinner here. For tasters-I do like the Avocado Egg Rolls, 3-fat egg rolls are stuff with fresh avocado, sun-dried tomato and cilantro sliced into 6-pieces, comes with a side of tamarind cashew sauce. French Country is a nice appetizer of mixed salad greens tossed in a light vinaigrette with beets, pecans & goat cheese Complimentary Sourdough & Squaw bread  I'm so predictable when it comes to my entree, I usually order the Lemon-herb roasted chicken.  The chicken is moist, sits on a good amount of creamy red potato mash cooked in a nice zesty sauce and topped with fresh herbs; portions are generous I recently ordered the Shepard's Pie and wasn't thrilled-its too heavy/saucy, the ground beef inconsistent in texture, with large chunks of ground beef within tender smaller ground beef; mash is always creamy good  Chicken Maderia is decent I've had a few of their cheesecakes.  Most recently: Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake With dessert I usually get a hot cuppa water and the tea selection-NOA & Numi  The patio maybe refreshing for some, it is certainly comfortable as far as tempurature-stays toasty on cold evenings, but uncomfortable as far as seating goes.

You come here because there's a menu the size of a small town's phone book with dishes that are measured in the thousands of calories. And really, that's not a bad thing, if done in moderation. When I was a kid, my father would yell if we went to a sit-down restaurant and I ordered a burger. The Cheesecake Factory has gotten me over this phobia because the burgers are so damn good. More importantly, they'll cook the burgers to order and this includes rare. Most sit-down burger places weenie out when you ask for a rare burger, but this place will serve it nice, pink and mooing. They'll even accommodate your need for meat, nothing but meat and just meat by serving it without the buns.  Of course, there's the cheesecake. Chances are, you'll want the cheesecake, but you'll never get to it because the meals are just so damn rich. My solution: eat the cheesecake first.

I've had two of the worst experiences I've ever had not just as a restaurant-goer but as a consumer at this place. One: While waiting for our table, we went to the bar section and ordered wine - but it never came, even though we reminded the bar waiter twice. When we were called to our table, the bar waiter actually demanded that we pay our tab! For wine we never got! Then the hostess tried to seat us at a table that another couple was waiting for and the other couple actually pushed us out of the way, sat down and then told us to get away from them while I tried to explain to the hostess that she needed to call the manager. When we went back to the reception area, I explained to a manager there about the indignities we had just suffered. I kept waiting for her to say: ""Sir, OK, let us get you seated and you'll enjoy a dinner on the house tonight."" But nothing. So I let a few years pass before I returned.  Two: When I did, the crowd was so thick and loud in the waiting area we couldn't hear what the host was telling us about the wait times so we left immediately.  Not to mention the completely unsatisfactory parking arrangement: either valet with long wait times for car pick up or go to the garage and walk five minutes from your car to the front of the restaurant, then negotiate the robot pay station on the way back to your car. It's a shame because it used be a completely civilized eating-out experience with great salads, pizzas and cheesecake, now it's just a mess. And I see they're bringing another to the neighborhood!

377,Eric W.,"Canoga Park, CA",166,672,148.0,4.0,2013-06-16,"This Cheesecake Factory has been here as long as I can remember. My parents went here when I was in high school -- and that was a long time ago. I've been going here on and off for the better part of the last 10 years or so. It's a really dependable somewhat high-end restaurant -- good food and usually excellent service. I've also been to locations in other California cities. The menu is massive -- pages and pages of items. The adage that a restaurant should have a small menu and do a few things really well is thrown out here. (I've read a lot about Cheesecake Factory through the years including a recent LA Times piece and a Time magazine article. The company is open about their practices, how they choose their menu items, etc. The menu is entirely based on which items sell -- if one doesn't even if the executives like it, it's removed from the menu.) This location is large too. It has a sizable outdoor patio in back that overlooks a deserted small tennis stadium. The bar area is first come, first serve. There's almost always a lot of people waiting for tables in the front foyer. They start you off with a bread basket with both a wheat and French bread. Both are tasty and you have to focus on not eating too much. They'll bring you more. I can't think of a bad meal I've had at any Cheesecake Factory. They're consistently tasty if not always remarkable and memorable. Their drinks are usually delicious.  Their portions are huge. I remember reading that they're designed to take half to go. They now offer a nutritional guide along with your menu. This is helpful because some of the dishes are 2,000+ calories. Their new calorie friendly menu is called Skinnylicious and offers a lot of appetizers, salads and entrees. Some of the items are already on the main menu. Their cheesecake selection, naturally, is huge. Slices are big and rich. Getting one to go after your meal so you can have a few bites at home and put it in the fridge is a good idea. Parking is in the structure in back or valet. They validate. I've heard they train their servers for two weeks before they set them loose in restaurants.

But the best part was the service given to my family by a pretty blonde waitress by the name of JADE. A bigger table way behind us over whelmed our original server, Joshua, as we had some issues.  My mom, who is 88, wanted some ice for her Chardonnay, the 2 Stella Artois orders were getting warmed (we sat outside as the AC was not working that day) and we needed to change the beer into ice cold glasses, and my wife needed another Zinfandel.  Needless to say we needed some service, but could not get the attention of Joshua.  Another server, Jade, who was taking care of her own tables rescued us, even though she had as many customers to attend to.  Instead of getting somebody else or Joshua to come to out aid, she took the challenge and came to our help straight away. She is not a diamond in the rough that you'll have to give her time to blossom.  No, she is a Jewel in their crown and please try to have her as your server. She is not only high energy, professional, but also made you feel that your concerns are her concerns.  Now that is what I call not only great service, but she should be an example for every waiter in Los Angeles to be like her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=760,4.16,3.74,3.74,3.572,3.9080000000000004

My sister is a vegetarian and boycotted the chain altogether. The last time I came the server barely spoke English but he was very nice. Also not their fault but there was construction going on and trees were being cut down. It was very loud and unpleasant outside. Not their fault though. For dessert I had the chocolate mousse cheesecake it was GOOD. I would give this four stars but had to knock one down for the beef gelatin seriously disgusts me.

So another 10 MINUTES later we finally got our waters (yes it apparently takes that long to get 3 glasses of water when you have 1 table) and then took about another 10-15 minutes for another server to come by and take our order. The food here is good but because of the crappy service I will never return here again and its a shame because I only live about 5 minutes away but I rather drive the extra 20-30 minutes to get great service and friendly and polite people then deal with servers who roll their eyes and give attitude, absolutely horrible horrible servers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=720,3.64,3.73,3.73,3.2680000000000002,3.6940000000000004

Manager brought out additional ingredients and new bread for our ""build your own club sandwich"". Our bleu cheese burger was lacking the bleu cheese - barely more than a thimble full. My factory burger was fine, but once again, we had to eat in shifts.

Went that last week in September as my youngest daughter (8) picked this place to hold our family dinner for her birthday.  She always gets the Pasta Da Vinci with grilled chicken and the staff, as always, offer up a little song and a free chocolate a cream dessert for the birthday girl. I had the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampy combo - served with mashed potatoe and if you are a garlic lover, the shrimp in the garlic lemon sauce can not be beat. The Tex Mex egg rolls are a ""must have""  and so are the Buffalo Blasts - order extra ranch. There is always plenty of bread and butter, and we have never had any complaints with the wait staff or the wait times.  The place gets busy, if you are not prepared to wait for a table, go out of rush hour, it is simple as that. Also, we like the outside patio in at this location. I read someone who gives the just CF 3 stars because it is an ""Upscale Denny's"" and the that they, the reviewer believes they ""have a better understanding of good food"".   This person is missing the point, in my opinion.  If the CF was being compared to a Michelin starred restaurant (maybe $200 a head without drinks) then, yes, 3 stars would be applicable - but who in their right mind goes to the CF for a fine dining experience?  No one - it is loud, busy, full of kids and people in shorts and flip flops and serves big portions of fattening food - washed down with copious amounts of soda/beer/fruity cocktails. What they server and how they serve it is exactly what their patrons what from that particular dining experience - and that is worth of 5 Stars.

This place is great for a group and they always seem to get our complicated orders right on the first time. There are no reservations from when I last checked, so the wait varies depending on the day. Hosts do their best to seat you as fast as possible, and there is a bar and lounge option as well. The cheesecakes and desserts on display can also keep you occupied during the wait time. I'd give 4.5 STARS if I could, because the only thing they need to improve is the birthday dessert that they give you. I got a cup of whipped cream and chocolate syrup with a candle in it.

The food is delicious (of course) and everyone I interacted with was super friendly and attentive... I had a wonderful dining experience. I showed up after a long day of shopping to grab a quick bite by myself (don't judge). The place was really busy but I was seated right away, shown to my table on the patio by a friendly gentleman, and was greeted by my server almost immediately. One of the servers noticed the table was a little wobbly so she came over with a rolled up napkin to place under the legs making it more stable. Thanks! The patio was a little chilly but somebody brought an extra heater out - problem solved.  I ordered the fried mac and cheese (so amazing, I get it almost every time). Unfortunately it was cold on the inside, almost as if it had come out of the fridge and wasn't cooked all the way through. I wouldn't have minded saving it for later but fried mac and cheese isn't really something you can reheat at home (and I was already satisfied by the flatbread I had orderd - also amazing), so I asked my server to kindly take it back. I was surprised that the manager came over to personally apologize for the cold food. He was so friendly and offered - no, insisted - to not only take care of the macaroni, but to send me home with a piece of cheesecake. They really went out of their way to fix a mistake and make my day! By the way, if you haven't had the tuxedo cheesecake yet then you're missing out. Even if you don't like cheesecake, you will devour this delicious piece of dessert. Thank you, management and staff, for a lovely experience - despite the cold food :) I will definitely be returning soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=480,3.44,3.79,3.79,3.3480000000000003,3.6500000000000004

447,Barbara M.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",0,38,,2.0,2014-01-02,"Our beloved Cheesecake Factory recently moved from it's ""forever"" home on Canoga Avenue in Woodland Hills to it's new home at Topanga Mall in Canoga Park.  Although the new venue is more convenient to patrons and has more exposure I'm not sure they did themselves a favor.  The atmosphere is warm and exciting, as was the previous location.  The bar area seems to be the biggest hit.  It's not as large as the Canoga venue and neither is the restaurant.  The noise level is very high but, so was Canoga.  That said, we were there during the holidays and the joint was jumpin. Our experience was less than exciting. We waited over an hour, but that was OK.  The host text us on our cell phone when our table was ready and we were free to go about our day in the mall.  We are absolute peppermint bark junkies and when we read the sign on the entrance door, ""Peppermint Bark Cheesecake Is Back"", we were in for the take.   We are now seated and ordered.  Marco, our waiter was wonderful.  The food was not.  I had Renee's special lunch which is a cup of soup (cold), chicken salad sandwich (full of bones) and a salad, which was the best on the plate.  When we inquired about the Peppermint Bark Cheesecake, Marco, our waiter, laughed and said it had been off the menu over a week.  We were heart fallen. It was the reason we decided to have lunch here and wait over an hour, anticipating the cheesecake.   Jodie, one of the managers, was a prince.  He removed my entree from the bill and apologized for the lack of the peppermint cheesecake and gave us a complimentary cheesecake which was, of course, wonderful.  The service, even though they were ""slammed"" was better than expected.  We applaud the managers and wait staff for their attentiveness.  The food, however, may take some time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=460,3.28,3.76,3.76,2.9200000000000004,3.5679999999999996

This never happens at the other location. After 15 minutes of dodging people, we were seated.

She offered to take something off of our bill, give us free dessert etc...We appreciated her offer so much.  But, sometimes I want folks to know that if someone is complaining, it's not just because they want a reduction in the bill.  It's because they want the owners/managers to know that something is wrong...  I want them to know...Because if it were my business, I'd want to know.

473,Adam G.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,4,3.0,2.0,2014-02-05,"Normally, I have exemplary experiences at the Cheesecake Factory.  I'm not really sure why this particular visit was different, but here goes. We arrived and were told that the wait for a party of two would be around 45 minutes.  That was accurate.  Patience was rewarded by a long wait at the host stand-- though when the host seated us, she was friendly, full of smiles, and attentive.  Still a chance for remediation. Having been in the restaurant for nearly an hour already, standing and waiting for a table, we were primed for a drink.  The server arrived about 10 minutes after we were seated and asked what we'd like.  We ordered the drinks and an appetizer, and after another ten minutes they arrived. Water took another 10, give or take five minutes. This was shaping up to be a ""hurry up and wait"" experience.  Initially, I thought the server was in a fairly netural mood. We were given a generous TWENTY MINUTES to make our way through the three corn dogs and the drinks we ordered.  A busser came by after about 10 to remove the quickly-devoured appetizer, and the server helpfully stopped by to ask how they were-- but only that.  When she did return to take our meal order a while later, the tired drinks were almost finished and we were still every bit as ravenous as when we walked in the door.  The server herself looked more harassed then when we had arrived. The meals arrived after another decade, and I asked for a refill.  This refill came quite promptly, though my sister made the observation that her pasta appeared to have been sitting for a while due to the more solidified quality of her marinara sauce.  My meal of chicken marsala seemed fine to me.  Being hungry, we gave little thought to it, and began our meal-- nearing the two hour mark.   By the time we had finished eating, we had been at the restaurant for about two hours and were about ready to move on and continue our evening. The finished plates sat for awhile until the busser removed mine.  The server returned a short while later to ask if my sister wanted a box, which was promptly delivered.   The bill took ages. We sat.  And we waited.  And we waited more.  The server appeared- short, and seeming to be undergoing some sort of internal struggle- and left us to determine who owed what.  By the time the server reappeared to take the cards, we were beyond ready to go home, having missed the movie we were hoping to make.  Uncharacteristically, she reappeared within two minutes, and we were free to go. Truly unfortunate, really. All-told, we were at Cheesecake Factory for almost three hours.  Every other time I've been there-- and I mean EVERY-- the servers have been quick, courteous, timely, polite, and helpful... As befits a restaurant of its caliber.  I'm disappointed, and I can't help feeling that they're overwhelmed in some way- despite being at least as busy in their former location on Canoga.  I understand that servers are human and that they're every bit as capable of having a bad day as the rest of us.  However, the mood and the timeliness of the server reflects on the business which employs them, and my sister and I were as polite as we always are to people who interact with our food behind closed doors. I would recommend a field that doesn't involve customer liaison if unable to bear these things in mind.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=420,3.68,3.77,3.77,2.6000000000000005,3.7340000000000004

I would suggest coming out for happy hour or lunchtime specials if you want to go easy on your wallet and have as little server contact as possible. We ordered our drinks first, the aunties took a little longer but as a server you have to just deal with it, showing your incapability to wait will not earn you a bigger tip. Upon waiting for the drinks, the kids realized they could not wait too long for their food...again they are kids...its understandable they can not wait for their meals. They flagged down the server and ordered right away, the spicy chicken sandwich and the crispy shrimp platter in addition to the Oreo milkshake and cheesy garlic bread. The server took their order and left without asking if everyone else was ready to order and disappeared for 30 minutes only to return and tell the kids that they had no ice cream left and could not make the milkshake. The server took our party's order in a rude, rushed manner, rolling his eyes with every request. Almost an hour and a half passed before we saw our order, the groups next to us had sat down for their meal and left twice over, very irritating. Finally our food came, this was probably the only good about our cheesecake experience. I ordered the veggie burger with a side salad while my mother ordered the fish tacos. Pretty tasty. The fries that came with my uncle's sandwich were satisfactory, I like the ranch that came with them, not too heavy. The spicy chipotle sauce was good too. The cheesy garlic bread, by the way, was no where to be found and was not presented other than on the bill. The kids were also very disappointed with the waiter offered them ice cream desert and wondered why he couldn't make their milkshake if he indeed had the ice cream on hand. The manager came by and apologized stating that the waiter didn't explain that milkshakes and sundaes consisted of different ice cream. The manager offered to make the milkshake using the sundae ice cream but I told him to forget it as we were pretty much done with our meals and could not wait another 30 minutes for a milkshake that I could get from a Jack in the Box. I flagged down another waitress for my cousin's birthday sundae as I did not want to deal with our waiter again, she promptly brought out the sundae (wish we had her as our server) and sang happy birthday all by her lonesome self.

I hadn't even known they had moved from Canoga, where, we had never encountered a problem. This, however, was possible my worst experience at a Cheesecake Factory ever and I frequent CF often, all across the country. We came for lunch around 12;30 on a Thursday. The wait was about 20 minutes, understandable. We were then seated all the way in the back, fine. Fine until we sat and sat and sat for a minimum of 15 minutes before anyone came to take a drink order let alone our food order. We both knew what we wanted before we sat down ('member frequent often). The waiter, who couldn't smile if his life depended on it, took our order and at least another 10 minutes passed before we got our drinks. They are in desperate need of an extra food/drink runner. My lunch companion then notified our waiter that there was gum under the table that was now stuck on her silk pants. His response ""what do you want me to do about it ? "", Oh, worst response ever! She asked for the manager who didn't come. The waiter finally returned and proceeded to scrap the gum off the table and give her a napkin for her pants.  The food took another 20 or so minutes. The food tasted good, as usual. Well, everything except the bread they bring, that was hard :( This was turning into the longest lunch ever and with no drink refills (until the check)!  My friend told the waiter the manager still had not stopped by. When he finally arrived he apologized and handed her a dry cleaners card. HA. Usually CF are on top of it, doesn't matter if you're busy, CF are always busy.

I ordered a margarita....Ok, I ordered TWO. Very good, but kind of expensive. ($10 each).  For my meal, I ordered the Shrimp with Angel Hair off the skinnylicious menu. It was delicious. Plus, it wasn't a HUGE portion like their regular menu items. The portion size was just right. Not too small, not too big. I was happy. I will definitely order that again, as well as ask for Stephen.  For dessert, I was a fatty and ordered the S'mores and Strawberry cheesecakes to go. The strawberry was good.

I worked at the location in the Trillium nearly a decade ago and I haven't been able to break myself of craving their flavors ever since. Everything is just so good, and I can tell you first-hand as someone who's been on the inside, they take a lot of care with their food and service.  I've been ordering my stuff to-go lately, which I feel is the ideal way to do it, as they are SO busy should you choose to dine in. To-go also ensures that you don't end up waiting more than a pre-set period of time.  They are aptly named The Cheesecake Factory. There's a plethora of awesome (and quite expensive) flavors to choose from for dessert; my favorite is the White Chocolate Raspberry, but they have an option for just about everybody. My only comment otherwise is that this definitely isn't dense New York-style cheesecake, so if that's what you're looking for, you will not find it here.  Their new location has them on the outskirts of the Topanga Mall.

579,Andy L.,"Pacoima, CA",283,220,6.0,3.0,2014-08-01,"Just A-OK. Rarely go to Cheesecake Factory, food is decent, cheesecakes are delicious but everything is overly priced. Decided to come here with a friend for National Cheesecake Day. Had to take advantage of slices being half off.  Food: My friend went with the Kobe burger and I got the lunch portion factory meatloaf. Food came out in decent time, didn't feel long but I think the table that came in after us got their food before us, maybe they ordered first? The burger looked delicious, the patty looked juicy, really juicy and it soaked to the bun, not a fan of that though. Stole some fries from my friend, a little bland but was crunchy. It was my first time getting the meatloaf and it was delicious. It was the lunch portion but there was still a good amount of food. The meatloaf was very flavorful and had a little crunchy outside and a juicy inside. The mash potatoes was alright, nothing too special but the gravy gave it good flavoring, the veggies were delicious though, good contrast to the meatloaf. It was good and filing even without finishing everything, had to save room for cheesecake.  Decided to split a cheesecake because we were pretty full. Plenty of choices and couldn't decide, ended up going with the red velvet one. Took a while to come out. Also had a little confusion, server thought we got it to-go when we wanted it there. But got it fixed quickly. Huge slice, thought it was going to be small with the deal they were having, couldn't finish it between the two of us. Always didn't like the cheesecake here since it's way too sweet but the red velvet one was not too sweet. Also to add onto the overly priced items, the strawberry lemonade was about $5 for something that tasted like Minute Maid from a carton. With that price you can get a beer at most places and it would have probably tasted better. Service: Was really crowded, expected being it was around lunch time and it being Cheesecake day. I like that instead of a pager they ask for your phone number and will text you when it's your table is ready. Table took about half an hour like they said it was going to take. What sucked was that they sat us ""outside"" as in not in the restaurant but in the sectioned off area inside the mall. It's weird to be having a meal with people shopping walking buy. At least there were pretty big fake bushes to act as a wall.

We were sweated right away and ordered a salad as an appetizer.  Boy it took forever to come out.  At least 15-20 minutes, and to make it worse, it didn't come until 2 minutes before the entree, which defeated the purpose of ordering it. As for the entree, I ordered a steak, medium well. It came well done. We didn't see our waiter in any reasonable amount of time to even give me a chance to let him know it wasn't cooked properly, so I chose to eat it instead of having to wait even longer for a new order to come out.  We actually didn't see our waiter again after he first brought us the food, until we were done eating. That's when he chose to come by and see ""how everything was"". My drink glass sat empty for half my meal and he never did offer a refill. This is the second time in 3 visits I've experienced this type of service at a local Cheesecake Factory. Food cooked wrong, long wait to get food, poor waiter service.

I finally get a waitress who asks us for a drink order when I let her know we wanted to order everything as I was already fearing I would not see her again/ Extremely rarely. She took our order and another 20 min go by and we STILL do NOT have drinks yet(don't even get me started on the bread) which never came until the meal after telling the manager about my horrid experience.

This is malarchy because I personally was a Barista at the coffee bean before and know exactly how long it should take to make a simple espresso. About 15 whole seconds for the shot to pour and to tamp/ prep the shot of espresso and to add sugar maybe another 15 seconds ? 15 minutes is NO EXCUSE and the manager was EXTREMELY unhelpful and was FULL of excuses trying to scape goat his way out of any fault that was rightfully his.

550,Michael N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,1.0,2014-09-08,"Went on a Sunday night. It was somewhat busy, but we did not mind waiting. They had us give our phone number and when our table would be ready, they would send a text -- which was a nice feature but poorly executed (read on for details). During this time we explored the connected mall, staying in shops that were close by. Once we got our text, we came right back within 2-3 minutes. I do not know if our table was given away in this 2-3 minutes, but after getting back they had us wait there for another 12 minutes which was extremely discouraging. Others also seemed to have the same fate of being called back and waiting on the side until the table was really ready since 4 others were called before us after we got back (they were there before us on the side), so I do not think it was just us. Food was fair at best, however I have always had great tasting meals at other Cheesecake Factory locations. So by comparison, it was poor for their standards. I had made a note to my date that the thrown together pasta she made previously was much better than the one she ordered. Service was fine, water was always filled. We did have a little over 10 minutes between the first time the waitress came to take our order and us saying, ""just another minute"", but I will not hold that against her since it was busy. Overall, I give a 1 star since I expected a good dinner out and the food really disappointed us and that is what I care about most with the review.

We were given a 20 minute wait time, and after about 30 minutes of waiting, we asked one of the hostesses how much longer we needed to wait, to which she replied ""any minute now"". After another 15 minutes of waiting, we again asked what was taking so long and the same hostess assured us that our name was just about to be called. After yet another 10 minutes of waiting (I'm being objective), I insisted on speaking with the manager. When the manager arrived, the hostesses claimed that not only was our name already called (which it certainly was not), but that we had already received a text notifying us that our table was ready (a bold-faced lie). One of the hostesses even had the audacity to claim that she had never seen me before.  Though we were eventually seated and had a good lunch, the lack of professional courtesy and attention was disgusting.

First, we approached a very nice  host gentleman who told us the wait was 15 mins. Cool. He said we'd get a text when our table was ready. We got the text, came right away, and was told to wait. We ended up waiting about another 15 mins. So i guess our table wasn't ready... Then we sit down and there's still someone else's check with money in it sitting on our table. I tried to give it to the hostess that sat us. She just told me she couldn't take it, or tell our server to come take it. It also made me wonder if the table had been wiped down because the last people's check wasn't moved. So we sat about 15 more mins when our waitress came to take both our drink and food orders. I could have used water a little earlier but what ever. We get our bread at the end of taking our order.  The food didn't take too long, what you'd expect for that caliber of restaurant. It also was pretty good, which is why they get the second star. Most annoying though, was being sat next to the kitchen and hearing people hooping and hollering about the foot ball game on the TV above us. Hard to have a nice anniversary dinner that way. After paying, I asked to talk with the manager. It ended up being an older brunnette (i think) lady. She did not seem to care. She kept saying I should have told her sooner so she could have made it better or done something. I wasn't trying to get anything for free. Then she tried to tell me some of what I didn't like was just the way they did things. I just thought that management should hear about a shitty experience so they can try to improve. She just did not care.  I went back to my table and it had been cleared (funny that it happened so fast because it wasn't cleared when we got there) and my hat I left on the seat was gone. I asked the server, she asked a busser in front of me. Both of them said they hadn't seen it, and I guess that was it. I waited in front of the table for about five mins before i decided to go ask for the manager again.  When explaining it to her, a host over heard and brought me my hat. Once again, the manager did not care that no one would help me find my hat. She just kind of pushed me out the door.

On arrival we spoke to the manager on duty who then informs us that our party wouldn't be seated until 10:30 pm a half our before they close? So we all agreed to wait in the hopes that we would be seated earlier mind you most of our party showed up 20 minutes early. While waiting for a table the restaurant was readily able to seat multiple parties of 7 and 6 and we found it very embarrassing that patrons of this place made comments like ""OMG they are still waiting?

I came in a large party and not only were we told we'd have to wait an approximate 2 hours to be seated, by the time we were actually seated, the surrounding area around us was fairly empty. With all those empty seats one would think that we could've been seated earlier. Our server was also not very welcoming and the whole vibe really felt as though our large party was not welcome. I've been coming here for a while now and have had little issue compared to the one I experienced the other night. It just seemed to lag the entire night with asking us for drinks and even taking our food orders. There were no bread refills and minimal drink refills. The whole experience left a bitter taste in my mouth concerning this establishment. If I ever come back here, it will be with a small party and I will never bring a party larger than 4 here again.

There was no wait tonight which says it all. When she took our order she asked me if the sides that come with my salmon are fine. I asked ""oh well do I have other options""? Then she tells me the vegetable options other than broccoli so I pick asparagus. Then when we get the bill she charged me extra for the swap while she never mentioned there would be a charge. Her shift ends before we ordered tea and she doesn't even come and let us know she's leaving and we get a different server (which was not much more personable either ). I had ordered a cheesecake  togo with the first girl which she never brought nor happened to mention to our new server. I mean the list goes on and on.

I asked the hubby how much did he pay and realized we were over charged. A meal was added to our order. I went back to resolve the issue and both manager and waiter was non apologetic nor did they seem to care. I know that people make mistakes but this one seems fishy and when you make a mistake apologize and humble yourself. They said they reversed the charge but never gave me a receipt for the back charge because the manager says they don't do that. So after they make a mistake I am just suppose to say ok and leave. I left because there was no point in arguing.  I am just wondering if that meal was added to our bill by mistake then where is the meal? How come it never showed up to our table especially when other servers bring the food to your table??? There is something wrong here???  Last week a friend was telling me that his credit card number was stolen at cheesecake factory and normally I don't check my bill but now I will be doing it so diligently.especially after this experience and my friends experience.

Okay cool, we sit down and immediately a waitress throws us out saying we could not seat ourselves on the low tables in the bar area...okkkaaaay...so we wait no problem I guess it's only bar top or high top tables that are this way...then when I returned I tried to put my name in for those tables in the bar area (so I could take advantage of their happy hour) and AGAIN the reception tells me it's a seat yourself section. I said ""no I fell for that the last time and was kicked out"" and then she walked me over there and sat me insisting it was a seat yourself section and sure enough we got served no problem, cool. Cut to today when I came in and asked the reception if the bar area was available for seat yourself and they said  ""yes it's always seat yourself"". Great! So we head over and sit down, within seconds a rude male waiter comes over and throws us out and shamed us to boot. I said ""sir the reception informed us it was okay and the last time I came it was the policy, has it changed once again?""

401,Christine F.,"Northridge, CA",0,13,1.0,2.0,2015-05-31,"I'm a Cheesecake Factory fan, but this is going to be a bad review. This was my first time at the new location in the mall. We waited 45 minutes for a table - no problem, it's a Friday night so that's normal. Once we were seated the problems began. The waiter was friendly and polite, but he forgot to bring our drinks. I had to flag him down to remind him. He ran off and drinks arrived about 10 minutes later. Then, he offered us bread which he also forgot to bring. I had to ask again. It took about 20 minutes just to get bread! The food also took forever and my husband's steak was not cooked the way he asked for it but he was so hungry he just ate it. No way were we going to send anything back because we would never see it again. It doesn't end there. They left out one of my husband's side dishes saying they would bring it separately. As you probably guessed by now, another very long wait ensued.  I had to flag down a different waitress because our waiter was too busy talking too long with a group at another table. She said our waiter would bring it. By this time, my husband had finished his meal and got his potatoes separately at the end.  They obviously were extremely busy and understaffed, which is a management problem. I order a lot of food, drinks and I tip well but I expect good service and I didn't get it. What really annoyed me was that our server kept standing at another group's table chatting for way too long while we (and likely others) were being neglected. The servers need to learn how to manage overly chatty customers when they're in a time crunch. The ambience is also worth mentioning. The restaurant is beautifully designed and decorated but there is no escaping the cramped feeling at this location. The old location was far more open and roomy. We were in a booth that felt like those rollercoaster seats. The only thing missing was the belt. We were long time customers at the previous location but I don't think we will be back to this new location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=380,3.16,3.08,3.168,3.1120000000000005,3.1120000000000005

We usually share a bottle of wine and a selection of appetizers during lunch. We usually are always seated fast here. The last time we went there was no wait at all which was nice. The restaurant is large, clean and they have decent music playing.  The staff is usually fantastic. The reason I write this review is because last time we went our server didn't arrive for over 15 minutes, arrived took our drink order and then didn't bring our drinks for another 15 minutes. We were still waiting when the nicest young lady came over (whom was also a waitress) and went and got our drink order right away, I'm talking 1 minute or less. She then took our entire order. To top it off she brought our original waiter to the table and schooled him on what we ordered and how to run things, I assume he was new. She was truly a gem and I've had her wait on us twice. Her name slips my mind at the moment, but she rocked. Made a bad experience into an awesome one.  Also we spilled a glass of wine and a bus boy helped us in about 10 seconds cleaning it up.

My family decided to start with the avocado egg rolls appetizer. My personal favorite, I enjoyed how the fresh avocado cubes go so well with the crunch of the egg rolls breading. They also have a sweet green sauce that adds a complicating taste to the all ready good egg roll.  I decided to stay on the healthy path as usual and go with the ""skinnylicious"" turkey burger(no mayo) with a salad. I thought they did a good job giving a dinner dish under 600 calories. I thought the Caramelized onions worked well with the turkey burger. The salad, however, was very disappointing. It was bland, and didn't have any significant taste to it. I ended up taking two bites & giving up on it. I enjoyed my dinner experience and would come back. The salad was really disappointing. I do think the 4 out of 5 was well deserved.

I came here with friends to grab dinner. I'd say the highlight of the dinner was the bread they bring to the table. That bread is so delicious, especially smeared with butter. I had ordered some chicken quesadilla dish which I found to be overly greasy. My pineapple mule was served in a tall glass instead of the traditional copper mug with tin lining. It was also overly sweet and seemed watered down. The service was good, our waiter was attentive but he was pushing the desserts way too hard. I don't know if I've ever had their cheesecake to be honest because I grew up in a very health-conscious family and since I suffer from my own health problems, I rarely indulge, but you gotta admit that their cheesecake flavors are impressive.

But I've had pretty good dining experiences here thus far. The service is very good and everyone is friendly. It just gets a little loud and hectic because it is in the Topanga Mall.   My favorite pasta is the Four Cheese pasta! So many different oozy cheeses with creamy texture! I always get this dish when I come here. Definitely worth the try!

361,Amir K.,"Woodland Hills, CA",7,59,25.0,1.0,2015-09-03,"I'm still reeling from this move.  Yes, the Trillium was a complete dump and never caught on because of the hideous pink granite tiles that covered the entire inside and outside of the building, but at least the Cheesecake Factory was HUGE with a great wait staff and laid out better than any other restaurant in the valley.  It's been a few years now since they've gone to the old CPK location and it's simply not enough space nor wait staff to handle the type of business that Cheesecake does.  They've also setup the patio, but it's the valley!  Nobody's going to sit outside for like 5 months out of the year due to the heat/cold.  Anyway, onto this particular experience...  They take your cellphone number to text you when your table's ready, but once you check-in with them you need to then wait another period of time until they seat you.  I can only assume that the point-of-sale alerts the hostess to call you when the credit card for the party vacating the table you're going to be on is swiped.  But some people like to hang around after paying the bill and shoot the breeze, thus causing this bizarre scenario where your table is ""ready"" but not really.  Moving past that, we ended up with absolutely atrocious service from our waiter who was either overworked or completely clueless.  Our drinks took nearly 20 minutes to come out and the food at least another 20.  The kitchen seemed like it was in total chaos.  I also saw the manager berate another waiter in front of us and both seemed visibly distraught over the situation.  Ironically enough, when it came time for us to pay, the waiter who was cut down by his manager helped us out by handling the check. Food:  Typical Cheesecake food.  Quality is good, portions are huge and there's always something for everyone on the menu.  Nothing ever stands out or is particularly memorable about the food, but everyone gets on well with whatever they ordered.  It's a known quantity. I hope for this restaurant's sake that it's planning on moving to the new part of Westfield that's designed to mimic the Grove.  If they signed a long-term lease here and are stuck in this little spot, I don't think I'm ever coming back given the new options that will inevitably open up once the build-out is complete.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=360,3.48,3.35,3.12,2.5320000000000005,3.402
356,J R.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,30,3.0,3.0,2015-09-04,"We went for dinner here mid-week (Wednesday evening).  To my surprise, the parking was a bit full.  That is probably due to the location being a shopping center.  Otherwise once we walked in, the wait for 3 people for dinner was 10-15 minutes.  The noise level is dependent on where you sat.  We were near the bar, so it was pretty loud and hard to make a conversation.  If you sit toward the back or outside, it would be a better location for a conversational dinner. They start off by offering you bread and butter (sourdough and whole wheat grain) and it was brought to our table warm.  We started off with fried calamari for appetizer, which was delicious but quite greasy.  It would have been better if they allowed it to sit a little longer to drain the oil.  It was served with a red cocktail sauce and garlic dip.  The cocktail sauce tasted like any traditional cocktail sauce and the garlic dip tasted more like mayonnaise and Dijon mustard with a hint of garlic.  It wasn't bad but this dish and its dips could use a little improvement. My dinner selection was from the skinny menu, Golden Steak Medallion.  It was served with roasted asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, cherry tomatoes and freshly mashed potatoes (not the kind you'd get out of a box).  The steak can be cooked to your liking, I chose medium well.  It was not over-seasoned and I could still taste the flavor of the angus steak.  It's not overly large portion so it was a perfect size for my appetite. The service was good, our server was Adam.  He did an excellent job making sure we got our food on time and checked on us if we needed anything.  We tipped him 19% of our bill.  Don't misunderstand the 3-star rating, the food was mediocre but our server did a great job.

My only major issue was the noise -- way too much noise as it is not absorbed and it made it difficult to converse across the table, but worse was the music from the speakers.

My go-to restaurant because they're open a bit later than other places and I love the wide variety of choices on their menu.    I went to this location a few nights ago for dinner with my friend. Our server was Mario. He's super nice and got us everything we asked for. I come to this location often with my boyfriend and we've had him as our server several times too. Always good service from him.  My absolute favorite on the menu is the pasta da vinci (penne pasta with chicken, mushrooms, caramelized onions, and a Marsala cream sauce). I'm also addicted to the brown, honey oat bread that they bring as an appetizer. When I came a few nights ago, I tried their cucumber lemonade for the first time. SO GOOD. It tastes really refreshing and there's free refills. And of course, their desserts are delicious. Some of my favorites are the tiramisu, white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, and tiramisu cheesecake. A few others are too sweet for my liking.  All in all, I love coming here to satisfy my cravings.

He did not offer any resolution right away for this mistake and he asked what do I want. I told him my kids are now eating and I cannot leave so maybe he can just put a clam chowder credit for me and Ill get it anytime. He said no I cant do it any other day only today because he is not there next Friday. Wow again! I am just very disappointed with the way this manager handles this very easy situation.

Then I ask for a up of water for my son and as he is drinking it notices the cup is dirty with some ort of food stuck in the inside of his cup. Gross, I bring it to the attention of the waitress who apologizes and beings another water. I expressed my concern to her that it was my first time at this restaurant and now I am unsettled regarding the rest of my order. To her credit she told the manager who also came over to my table and apologized, but here is the kicker...He didn't offer me even a 10% discount, piece of free cheesecake...nothing. It seemed very disengenous and matter of fact. Heck when McDonalds messes up they give you a free hash brown or fries. I've had an order go wrong at Olive Garden once and they offered me a free desert. Well this cup incident was gross.

This location has nestled itself nicely in the Topanga Mall, right smack where the Sears used to be and right across from Forever21. I choose this location as a fave, because if you're familiar with Cheesecake Factory, you know you will most likely wait awhile to get seated. The great thing about this location is that ""waiting"" can turn into something productive. They ask for your phone number so  they can text you. Nope, they don't give you those annoying, useless .1223942 mile radius pagers that just confine you to the waiting area of the restaurant so you can see your life and stomach pass by as the hostess calls out parties before you. That being said, there's a huge mall to walk around in while you wait! Go get your new pair of jeans before you get too bloated after dinner! Take advantage of that sale at H&M or snoop around Apple just to kill time on your facebook games. Orrrr better yet, you can get all your shopping musts done at Target.  It seems smaller than it's former location, but they are very swift with their service. My menu faves are:  -Tex Mex Rolls (appetizer) -Avocado Rolls (appetizer) -Chicken Piccata -Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp -Luau Salad  -Chicken and Biscuits -Hibachi Steak -Miso Salmon (with brown rice!) Cheesecake Faves:  -White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle (rich with a touch of tangy fruit!) -Mango Key Lime (tropical, light, and tasty!) -Banana (light, basic, and delish!) -White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut (richhhhh) -Lemon Raspberry Cream (light and amazing!

221,Vijay C.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",39,266,38.0,1.0,2016-02-28,"Where do I begin? I ordered a cheesecake on December 23 and went to pick it up shortly after 5pm. Never mind how expensive it was and that it tasted off for some reason. My problem was the customer service.  I waited and waited and waited for my cheesecake to be ready. As did others. I stood at the bakery growing more and more impatient. Then some server told me I needed to move because I was in the walkway, which admittedly I sort of was but at least a half dozen employees were able to pass me and didn't make any comment at all about it. But for some reason this server decided to angrily tell me to move out of the way because, and I quote, ""I am preventing people from doing their job"". My response was ""I'm not sure how me standing here is preventing the three people who are more than 5 feet away from me from doing their job"". She just made several sarcastic remarks that frankly irritated me given I was a customer and she was belittling me. One of the bakery workers saw this and rushed to get me my cheesecake so I can be happy and leave. I happily took the cheesecake and left the bakery area. Is this where the story ends? Nope. Some very tall individual in a blue dress shirt was behind the bakery register. He clearly looked like a manager. I went up to tell him that I did not appreciate the manner in which one of the servers talked to me. I wasn't going to ask for anything - especially since I already paid for my cheesecake about a half hour ago at this point - but to let him know that what happened. Well he didn't look like he cared at all about what I wanted to say or my feelings. He just wanted to help people in line at the register and ignored me. Normally I'd get incredibly angry at this and make a scene but at this point I had my cake and just wanted to go. Oh and to add injury to insult, this cheesecake which cost more than $40, did not taste right. Something about it was off. So yeah, terrible customer service, including from a probable manager and a lackluster product. Hence the One star review.  Update: 28 days later and no one from Cheesecake Factory has reached out to me. You would think they care about something like this, especially when I outright call out a manager for poor customer service but I guess they don't care as long as they got paid for their goods. A place like the yardhouse in Northridge immediately reached out to me when I left a poor review. I have since become a regular there. I highly recommend the yardhouse and I highly dissuade you from the Cheesecake Factory.  Update. It's now two months later and still nothing.

Yeah, their food is typical but I do enjoy their portion sizes and how huge their textbook menus are. I'm currently on a diet so it's nice that they have a Skinnylicious menu - all items are under 590 calories and once again their portions are huge! My usual is the Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo with brown rice (sooooo delicious) but since that's a whopping 1600 calories I opted for the skinnylicious Mexican Tortilla Salad which was only 570 calories. It was packed with so much flavor and since it was a big portion I took half of it home. I have to add that Cheesecake needs to add more vegan options to their menu. My friend is currently fasting and has to go vegan and it was nearly impossible to find anything without modifying all the ingredients. Our server Jason was a champ though! He made sure to accommodate my friend and came back to our table countless times to give us modifications. Hands down best server there! By the way, my favorite cheesecake is the strawberry cheesecake. Soooo yummy and has less calories than any of the other chocolate ones.

First of all, we all know that the Cheesecake Factory ALWAYS provides complimentary bread (so delicious!) Anyway...since I only ordered 2 slices of cheesecake (my first time ordering just the dessert because I've had sushi dinner), the delivery person said that they couldn't provide another slice of ""complimentary"" bread (see the photo I added for what I received). I explicitly asked for the wheat brown bread...but they couldn't provide me that according to the delivery person (I received white bread) because one of the staff said my order was ONLY two slices of cheesecake... That is very impolite ... I paid about $18 just for those two slices of cheesecake that include a ""service fee"" So I called Cheesecake Factory and one of the staff transferred me to Veronica who didn't sound so nice on the phone...maybe it was a long day, I understand. Veronica claims that what the delivery person stated wasn't true.. Hmm ok ... How can she know it wasn't true? Now I wonder who handled my order...sounds very defensive to me.

The manager asks me to check the new burger.  I cut into it and it's basically still breathing; raw as it can be.  He agrees and takes it back.  I tell him this will be the last time.  He returns about seven minutes later as my wife's burger is now cold and unappetizing. Upon his return, I cut open the burger again (the same burger) and it's still blood red. Manager says he's sorry, and he offers me a slice of cheesecake in place of the burger.  Being on a diet, I decline.

I called today (the day to pick up) let them know if be there by 5 and to please make sure it was cut and ready to serve. I show up around 5:15 and they initially didn't know what I was speaking of, they fumbled around looking for it and finally after about 15-20 min the manager came over and explained to me that the cheesecake was still frozen and I would need to leave it out for about 2 hours.

I have enjoyed the lettuce wraps before, and they taste great and healthy. This time I had grilled salmon with mashed potatoes, a lemon cream sauce and fresh asparagus. It was great! A wee bit over cooked, but way better than most restaurants. Over cooking salmon is a pet peeve.  I was there with a friend for a long lunch, so we kept the table for a long time. The waitress was attentive and understanding.  I finally ordered the Oreo vanilla ice cream shake. Yummy.  I was energized enough to go to Nordstrom's for a great new hat. CF was not crowded, the tables are well spaced, the food was excellent and the waitress was excellent, so she got a great tip. A very happy experience, unexpected in a shopping center.

We parked our car right by the front door, and we were sent a text message with a link to retrieve our car. The Cheesecake Factory restaurant itself was very well-maintained. I was surprised at how clean the men's restroom was despite the restaurant being completely full. While we were waiting for our table, I had the opportunity to visit the bar. There were no available spots, and the bartender went out of his way to approach me. I have some experience as a bartender, and I watched as he made the drinks - all the proportions were by the book. When the time came for us to be seated, we were approached by a very friendly lady who took us to our table. Our waitress was also very happy and cheerful. We ordered a rather complicated order with a lot of modifications, and everything was delivered to our table exactly how we ordered it. The food was of the classic Cheesecake Factory variety: consistent, well-prepared and reasonably priced. We brought our own Champagne, and it was opened for us with proper glasses, put on ice, and a towel was provided. The corkage fee was more than reasonable. As we were eating, we experienced a small problem with our table. We brought it to the staff's attention, and the manager immediately came out, apologized profusely and moved us to another table. When we asked for the check, the manager personally brought it to us and comped a large portion of our order. All in all, I was so impressed with the entire evening that I chose to write this review. I can't believe that this place is rated so low on Yelp. We got Beverly Hills service at Cheesecake Factory prices. Maybe people are upset because of the wait, but ... nothing can be done about that. The food, the service, the location and the attention are great. No wonder people keep coming.

I went to Cheesecake Factory today for lunch after shopping with my family and we got food , which was wonderful by the way ,the only thing is  I WARN anyone who dined there to beware of their personal belongings...  As I was leaving I know I remember placing my expensive glasses on the table looking for my wallet to pay and I know cause that's where I left them $400 Tom Ford Sunglasses and  I realized walking out , right away I went back n they were gone SUPPOSEDLY NONE of the staff saw them (LIARS BTW) the mgr LAUREN BLONDE VERY RUDE by the way was not being a good manager trying to rush me out after my family n I just ate there n gave our business .... She was very rude n unsympathetic... said she had an honest staff ... just how honest are the staff though ... no other dining customers were sitting near us we were in the back toward the mall , ... I'm sure corporate would love to hear about this supposedly honest staff who takes thing that don't belong to them ... ALL I CAN SAY is Lauren shouldn't be a Manager ... on top of that why I really could tell she was rushing me is because she did not even ask me to get my number in the first place I had to call back in case anybody did find anything she just rushed me and wanted me to leave like she couldn't handle a tough situation, That's not a manager that's just somebody who is lazy and doesn't want to do their job . So be careful when leaving your items even keys on the table because one of the staff members can come by and steal them ... i'm sure corporate's gonna love to hear about this.

Normally most Cheesecake Factory restaurants have ridiculously long wait times so I was impressed when the really nice hostess told us we would only have a 20 minute wait. We got a text message when it was time to be seated and the beginning of our experience seemed great. We noticed it took a reaaally long time for our server to even approach our table. After what felt like about 10 minutes being at the table, our server finally came to our table with a dry introduction, not including her name, and went off to get our drinks. Maybe 10-15 more minutes had passed and she finally came back to take our order. She seemed to have great knowledge of the menu, however, the service was AWFUL. She never came to check on us, another server had to refill my beverage, and she eventually came back to give me the cheese that was originally supposed to be added to my salad but instead thrown in a bowl. She had to walk by our table to take care of her other tables so I don't quite understand why she simply didn't stop by our table on the way to the others to check up on us. The food was OKAY. My chicken inside one of the enchiladas was slightly burned but I just ate around it. 2 stars for the prompt seating. Other than that, everything seemed to go downhill.

With the same look and feel of other locations elsewhere, it's a great setting. Something to make note is that the location has two patios here, one is situated outside, and another patio is inside the mall setting. The restaurant is located at the entrance of the mall where there is also a valet area structured between Neiman Marcus and the old Sears building.  I've found service to be generally pretty solid with a couple misses here and there. Expect it to be fairly busy at all times.  Located at the Westfield Topanga Mall parking is all around you, good luck! --Food, Drinks & Prices--- I'm sure you know what they provide here and at the many other locations; the menu is vast with all sorts of things. Many appetizers, small plates, pasta dishes, pizzas, burgers and sandwiches, soups and salads, tacos, chicken and steak dishes, seafood, and all other sorts of entrees, ranging and hitting many flavors of different cuisines. Portions are large and same with the calories in everything (don't look!).  Love the fresh bread and butter they serve first. I've pretty much loved everything I've had at the Factory over the years, can't go wrong with anything really.  Here's a few things I've tried: -Avocado Eggrolls - Avocado lovers unite! Tons of it obviously with a couple other ingredients mixed in served with a tamarind dipping sauce.  -Tex-Mex Eggrolls - Crispy rolls filled w/spicy chicken, corn, black beans, peppers, onions and melted cheese. Served with avocado cream and a pica de gallo.  -Buffalo Bites - Lots of breading on this thing but for those who love buffalo sauce these are filled with chicken, cheese and wing sauce.  -Crab Cakes - Three of them I believe and pretty tasty.  -Meatballs with ricotta and garlic bread - Great meatballs and sauce, served with great bread for dipping -Chicken Scampi Pasta - All the great flavors of a scampi, delicious.  -Steak Diane - Medallions of certified angus beef steak covered with black peppercorns and a rich mushroom wine sauce. Served with mashed potatoes and grilled onions. Great! -Pumpkin Cheesecake - If you like pumpkin pie you'll adore this just the same.  All sorts of drinks and a full bar is available. Something to note is that The Factory has it's own line of wine, I believe beer as well (I may be wrong on that).

Not the crisp shrimp batter . . . but a partly cooked flour tasting batter . . . miniscule amount of mushroom. Shrimp with Angel Hair - five VERY SMALL dried out shrimp on top of angel hair. Some tomato and garlic had been thrown on top of the pasta. Not tossed at all. Had to re-do it at home to make the pasta edible. Tossed the shrimp (That bad!) Chicken Romano - pieces of chicken again overcooked to the point of dry leather . . . tossed those, too. The Thai salmon was OK - over cooked but edible. As for the desserts - Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake has changed - very heavy on very sweet gooey layer - Linda's cake also has lost its balance. We have had a few poor experiences in the past months . . . this will likely take a long time family staple completely off the list for a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=400,3.28,3.19,3.216,2.5960000000000005,3.226

She was very accommodating and very quick with our drinks and requests.  LOCATION-4 STARS It's in the mall and sort of outside of that makes sense. You can come eat and then walk off all the calories after.  AMBIANCE- 5 STARS  I  came during the week so it was fairly quiet and slow so I absolutely loved it.  FOOD- 4 STARS  You can never really go wrong at The Cheesecake Factory. The prices are low and the plates are huge!!!! I mean HUGE! Here's what we tried at this location.

I'm a basic man who knows what he wants and rarely steers away from it. I usually like to start with the dark honey oat bread. I feel like they never make enough of it because the waiter and waitress' are always so stingy with it and keep bringing out a white bread or their out of the honey oat bread. I could eat that bread for days.  On to the appetizers, while I'm sure they have all types of amazing appetizers, the best one is the avocado egg rolls. Literally, i can go to this place and just get 3 orders of these things. Dare I say one of gods gift to earth? Lol. Now for entree's they have some AMAZING options. Usually my go to's are the Chicken Fettuccini alfredo, BBQ Chicken salad and last but not least the Santa Fe Salad. I'm sure there are so many more that I would like but never gave them a chance. This place is great for a date and they have valet parking.  Finally, their cheesecake, while it is still pretty good, it is not the best I've tried. Pretty good stuff but for being called ""The Cheese Cake Factory"" I think you can do better than you currently are. I've tried over 7 of their cheesecakes and have yet to be blown away by one.

Very very, noisy. I went there before Christmas and the music was so loud that I could not hear anything my friends say. So we chose to communicate through text messaging, hilarious. The music was not my cup of tea and very loud, at least they could have played Christmas songs. 4. I asked for bread, which I love, and they were bringing it with the check after the dinner. 5.

Although, such a comment was made at the Cheesecake Factory at The Grove many centuries ago, one may never forget. The Cheesecake Factory is where you go to bring yourself back down to size. With the many LA restaurants, dinners at Mr. Chow, driving around MILK only to scurry in and out before the parking people  show up, it is a consistent and tasty place amid all of the madness. The menu is very much book like, they quite literally, have it all! Asian cuisine, some breakfast items served all day, and about a million different cheesecake flavors. This location is almost always crowded and we waited nearly an hour for one of the smaller tables. No complaints there, it's busy most times even on weekdays. I had the veggie burger which Cheesecake describes as ""A Delicious ""Burger"" Made with Brown Rice, Farro, Mushrooms, Black Beans and Onion"". The burger is huge, piping hot and the fries were well seasoned. Not bad for a meatless Monday! The orange chicken an lemon ricotta pancakes are worth a mention her as well. I would return during breakfast hours, they open pretty early at 10am on weekends. Sometimes the bakery staff can be less than savory which is a bit of a complaint, but nothing to go into detail about.

Last night my friend and I came in around 5:30PM for dinner. We were sat in an empty section in the back. They must have just opened our section because after we were sat there were other parties being sat all around us. Jaclyn, our server got us drinks and put in our order. We got our water but never any refills. When we got our food we never saw her again. Kept trying to get her attention but she never ever even looked at us. Did not have a drink the entire time I had my meal. Jaclyn was way too focused on the group of 7 or 8 sitting next to us.. But we were sat first...? It was clear that she was trying to make a better tip with the larger party. A different server brought us our check. I was confused who our server even was at this point. A manager came by our table and said, ""Sorry she got so caught up with her other table."" But, we were first to be sat, why were we left in the dust?

166,Ellen I.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,41,1.0,2.0,2017-01-28,"Generally speaking I leave The Cheesecake Factory with a to-go box, as I have never actually finished a meal there. Last night, however, I left the restaurant hungry.  In short, after an hour wait (not the estimated 40 minutes), which was understandable due to it being a Friday evening, we were shown to a table in the mall. You know the place--next to the closed Sears location. Ordinarily, not an issue, but it was cold last night. Everyone in the section was wearing a jacket. As it was late, and given the fact that it was a busy Friday, we put our jackets on and sucked it up.  Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. Three meals satisfactory, mine cold. Not just warm from the trek from the kitchen across several dining rooms to the mall warm, but cold. Pre-prepped mashed potatoes that were scooped out of a bowl without warming. Broccoli that went a tad past crisp-tender to blanched and sitting in ice water. So I sent it back. I told my dinner mates to eat, lest theirs get cold.  So 15 minutes (and three clean platers) later, my dish arrived. The waitress apologized for the issue and walked away. The plate itself was warm, but if it was possible, the food was actually colder than when I sent it back the first time.  I handed my plate to the first person I could find and asked to have the meal removed from my bill. Which it was.  A manager came over to apologize and ask if he could bring me another meal, some cheesecake, a to-go box, something, anything? Thanks, but no thanks. I really did not need to subject us all to another 20 minutes of sitting in the cold mall. Besides, ironically, I had spent a good part of the day baking an elaborate triple chocolate mousse birthday cake, so a slice of cheesecake wasn't going to placate me.  While I appreciate the manager showing up to make amends, I have to say, this chain has been around for a long time, and this wasn't the first busy Friday night. If a plate comes back because the food is cold, the expediter shouldn't send it back to a customer unless there is steam rising from the mashed potatoes! In the main, I find The Cheesecake Factory a fun and satisfying place to eat, especially with people whose palates are all over the place. I had a situation arise about six months ago with a location in New Jersey, and during a call with corporate, I said that I wouldn't Yelp the experience because it was a ""training opportunity"" that I was sure they would address. (Curiosity seekers can reference my Maggiano's review.) Had that situation not happened, I probably wouldn't have bothered with this one because not every service meets the ideal. Someone draws the short straw, and last night it was I.  But this is two strikes, Cheesecake Factory. Three, and you're out.

They've recently raised their prices again, so I won't be eating dinner at any CF anymore - just the before 5pm lunch specials from now on.   And I never tire of their cobb salad.  I didn't like cobb salad at all, till I first had theirs.  In the 30 years I've been a customer, I've had terrible experiences and great experiences (the one in Sherman Oaks is the most inconsistent; the one in the Marina is the most reliable; the one in Beverly Hills is inbetween) - but overall, I never hesitate to eat at CF.  If we can't think of a place to go, we'll often just end up at a CF.   But why do they call it Cheesecake Factory? - the cheesecake is truly mediocre (I know everyone thinks its great - but millions of people think McDonald's is edible food, too).  Anyway, the high staff turnover tells you something (and not something good, of course), but I'm still solid on giving the whole chain 4 stars all the way (sorry, 5 is out of the question, as that would suggest that the food has been prepared/cooked by human hands).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=80,3.2,3.29,3.2,3.2800000000000002,3.254

I arrived early... nothing is ready. The cake is NOT EVEN A CAKE!! (my fault for not being suuuuuper clear that I need a STRAWBERRY SHORT CAKE, to celebrate strawberry shortcake day!) Nothing was prepared when I arrived. It is now 9;20 and mushrooms are still not ready. Meanwhile, the ice cream is melting. The biscuits are getting soggy and not a single person in their staff is can take responsibility. Not even a simple, ""sorry to keep you waiting"" or ""we'll be with you in a minute"" or something....??! In their defense seems like there are a handful of other unhappy eaters who were mistreated by a waiter and need to speak to a manager.  But not sure if that should make me feel sorry or even more disappointed for coming here. Oooh update! Someone literally just came to charge  me $8 for a side of ranch dressing and Parmesan cheese (asking for a receipt to add a pic). WOW!  I called my sister to find another place to pick up a strawberry shortcake right now... the rest of the guests know I was going to this Cheesecake Factory at 9 for pick up-- they all heard me place the order at 8pm and watched me head out at 8:30.. Thissss is going to be a funny story to share when I get back. It's 9:40, but, I'm on my way guys!

It's Monday through Friday 4 to 6 p.m. at this location. They have a wide variety of happy hour food items and lots of drink options as well. So far, we've tried the stuffed mushrooms, happy hour burger sliders, fries, Greek salad, and summer spring rolls. All are delicious. The soy dipping sauce for the summer rolls was really tasty and refreshing. The salad was fresh with a nice tangy dressing. The stuff mushrooms were really flavorful. The fries and the sliders were well cooked and nice. I also had the happy hour mojito. It's kind of light on alcohol, but for $5.75 it's a decent drink.  I guess the only down side is you can only do happy hours in the bar area with limited amount of tables, it usually fills up fast.

32,Michelle C.,"Solvang, CA",139,5,,1.0,2017-11-19,This location has cockroaches. I watched one crawl around the front where you walk in and the staff didn't do anything about it until a manager was finally notified and was more grossed out that she had to pick it up rather then it being there in the first place. I left really grossed out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=20,3.2,3.39,3.288,2.6600000000000006,3.314
10,Lola W.,"Santa Monica, CA",2,62,17.0,4.0,2017-11-23,"Stopped by for a quick lunch Friday afternoon and was able to be seated right away. This Cheesecake Factory is located on the outside of the mall with entrance from the parking lot. I always find it odd that parking is a little tricky for this location given it's located by the parking lot.  This location seems clean and well kept. The servers were really nice and offered to take our drink order right away. Bread and butter was brought to the table promptly. Once we placed our orders, we didn't wait long for our food. My all-time favorite items at Cheesecake are avocado egg rolls and buffalo wings. While the menu offers much yummier items, for me, those two are favoriteeee. Which means I order them at each location and judge each location how well they can prepare those items. Oddly enough, yes they do vary in flavor, freshness, etc. The avocado egg rolls were amazing, super fresh. Fresh avocado and really well made. Chicken wings were good too, I personally think they were better/crispier at The Grove location.  Another items I tried this particular day was chicken madeira, which is their most popular item, or so it says so on their menu. Anyway, it was really good. Chicken was juicy and not dry at all, super filling too.  Overall one of the better locations for Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park,3.24,3.39,3.296,3.024,3.33
12,Leslie A.,"Canoga Park, CA",40,152,183.0,2.0,2017-11-29,"First time coming to The Cheesecake Factory since they made the move over from the Warner Center.  *Deep Sigh* What happened guys? Like... what were you guys thinking? When The Cheesecake Factory was located in Warner Center it was worth going to. It felt fancy AF in there. It was clean, the outside seating was beautiful, & it stood on it's own. It was FUN to go out & have a date night. Now... it sucks. It's located on probably the worst side of the mall by the old Sears. ""Outside"" seating is just a joke. You get either: a beautiful view of the Valet Parking lot, so you can watch the snobs too lazy to find parking on their own pay $15. Or you can choose plan B of their outdoor seating by having a beautiful view of the MALL. & by view of the mall, I mean all you see is an old Sears, Wetzels Pretzels, & Forever 21. WTF? Again, what was the thought process here? While I'm sure sales are up because of the foot traffic, the quality has gone doooown. This place is Sizzler quality now. Sucks. Find somewhere else to buy a $20 bowl of chicken.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park,3.24,3.36,3.284,,3.3120000000000007
21,Esther C.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,8,2.0,4.0,2017-11-29,Ate here for my birthday with my parents and boyfriend. As usual they were packed so service (although they were very nice) was lacking. It was hard to flag down our waiter.  However the dishes I tried were fantastic. We ordered two dishes off of their specialties menu (new dishes that they are testing the waters with). I forget the exact name but it had Asian influences and contained chicken and pineapples. I didn't fall in love with it but my boyfriend raved about it afterwards for a long time. Next we ordered the carne asada medallions. Delicious! Absolutely recommend it for the next time you go. Lastly we ordered the fresh strawberry cheesecake. No complaints there. They wrote happy birthday and I was ecstatic.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=20,3.36,3.36,3.296,,3.3600000000000003

But what I'm most upset about is I order their desserts fairly often (to go) and I've been noticing the slices have been getting more slender, but tonight's portion was just RIDICULOUS ! I ordered a ""tower truffle cake"" and was beyond disappointed! I understand if you have to make cuts here and there, but I feel like I got gypped ! It was literally half of a half slice, for $10.95..absolutely not worth it. If you're going to serve child portions then you should charge something more reasonable, I mean really.

3,Nikki K.,"Los Angeles, CA",998,100,225.0,3.0,2017-12-05,"I'm torn between giving this location a two or three star review. I understand that all Cheesecake Factory's are extremely busy, especially on the weekends, but that should not compromise the service of the staff. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by two hosts backs turned towards us. One of the girls turned around, looked directly at us and continued her non-work related conversation with her co worker. When she finally had the time to do her job, she ""welcomed"" us by curtly asking, ""how many?"" I asked her how long the wait would be for a party of 2, and she let out a sigh looked around and said maybe 10 minutes. I put our name down and we waited on the side of the host's stand.  I was extremely upset with the host's attitude and lack of customer service skills. I understand that everyone has bad days or that you may not like your job, but it's very obvious when there is absolutely no effort being put into your job. We were very fortunate to have a very polite and friendly server named Daryl. He instantly changed my mood when he greeted us with warm fresh bread and promptly took our orders. The food was delicious and Daryl went above and beyond to turn our dining experience around.  If you dine in at this Cheesecake Factory's location, beware of the rude service from the hosts!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park,3.2,3.34,3.276,,3.2840000000000007

Okay I'm sorry didn't know I was being that inconsiderate. The manager Justin is very quick to end the conversation not giving me good hospitality only reason why I'm here because my little brother wanted to eat here so bad and shop at the Topanga mall but this will be the last time I come here.

It was unacceptable and definitely upsetting that my pregnant sister had to wait over an hour for her food.

Both nights our food took over an hour to arrive after ordering it.   We had to send back food last night because it was burned. At the very least our servers could have said something instead they just ignored us. I understand sometimes things happen but be up front about it. It's not a big deal. Then what really irked me was when one of the guys bussing the table behind us was hitting the bread crumbs off the seat with his towel and they went flying  right by us slightly hitting my son in the face. The manager came out to our table and apologized how their Kitchen should not be like this. Not only should the kitchen not be like this the people working here should not be like this as well.
