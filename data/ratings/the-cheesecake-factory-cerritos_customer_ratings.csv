The staff was training, but did an a great job with our food. They officially open for business on 11/3/15 so come check it out. They're eager to please and the food is on point!

413,Jonathan P.,"Signal Hill, CA",204,22,2.0,1.0,2015-11-03,"This beautiful location had so much potential to be a great dining experience. It had the standard decor as seen at all other cheesecake factories. Pleasant, modern Tuscan. The first issues started with our waiter who seemed sarcastically rude the entire time.  I won't share any names because maybe he was just having a tough grand opening and I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. The bread came to our table cold and quite infrequently.  There was no problem with our drinks but the food felt like it took awhile and the waiter didn't give us any update as to why the food was taking awhile. When the food finally came, it looked great. Unfortunately only half our table was served. The rest of the food didn't come out until 15min later and one of our friends didn't get their food until 10mim after that. Prior to their food coming out came the biggest issue of all. I subbed out the fries that came with the rib eye steak with Mac and cheese. It looked great. 3 bites into the Mac, I bit down on a broken piece of plate. Might have chipped my tooth. They offered to file a report with corporate. Depending on how my mouth feels in the next week, I may come back to speak with Kelly, the manager. She was perfect in her accommodations and hospitality. I was comp'ed for my steak and they gave me a free slice of cheesecake. I appreciated that. But the waiter kept throwing his rude behavior at us, even as we were paying the check. Making this dining experience quite unpleasant. He even mixed up all the take out boxes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=400,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34
763,Flip C.,"Cerritos, CA",0,13,3.0,4.0,2015-11-04,"I came here for lunch with my mom, 2nd day officially open and excited because a Cheesecake  Factory Restaurant opened so close to my home.  The Cheesecake maybe my nephew CJ'S favorite restaurant or one of them.  And my family has enjoyed the food for years more so my sister's family who have gone more frequently.  The Cheesecake Factory has a reputation for being a little pricier for a family casual restaurant but they do make up for it with their large portions.  It is very rare that diners dont go home without the doggy bag.  As my mom and me came for lunch we figured less expensive and smaller portions you would expect.  I was correct about the less expensive but was pleasantly suprised at the portions. Our meal did start of with the complimentary bread with butter, the brown loaf especially tasty though it could have been warmed, isn't it supposed to be?  We were offered refills, which we accepted of course.  My mom ordered the Chicken and Mushroom Lettuce Wraps off the Skinnylicious menu, yes listed as an appetizer but my mom being 85 yrs old wanted something light.  I ordered one of their famous pastas, the Louisiana which had Chicken and Farafelle pasta in a spicy cream sauce.  The food was delicious but enjoyment was tempered a little by the fact the food was served warm not really hot.  But the portions were huge, surprised at the size and couldn't finish it all. My mom understandable but me, I'm a big guy.  So of course had a doggy bag or two. Service was very good, I believe our waitress' name was Madeline?  She was very attentive and very cordial.  Also answered our questions about the opening of the restaurant and the operations.  The price for two for lunch no more than Twenty bucks before tax and tip.  My mom and I enjoyed our first experience here enough that we will probably bring the rest of my family here, including my nephew, this coming Sunday for dinner.  Oh the place looked beautiful of course, and all the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful.  Being new there were a few mis-steps to be expected, but once this place hits it's stride as time goes by may rate a 5 star rather than 4.  This being the Cheesecake factory expect it to be busy, especially at dinner, found out they do take reservations.  Lunch is a good time to go if you can, though busy not crowded and did not have to wait to be seated.  A very enjoyable experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=760,2.384,2.384,2.384,2.384,2.384

I was very disappointed by the drink I ordered. Order a regular Mojito, very week. I watched the guy make it and he was training . Service is not that great. The hosts seat our party down and it took 20 minutes for the server to come to our table. He was good but did not really know the menu.

Within a few minutes she called me back and left a message that what I wanted (turkey burger) was not available and to call back and update my order.  I called right back and was in hold for 8 minutes (I have a timer on my work phone). The girl who answered the phone when I called back was said Steohannir was on the other line.  I told her I need to clock out for lunch and asked her if she can pls tell Stephanie my new order. She said she can't take orders. I said that's fine but can she then give my new order to stephanie....she said no. Ugh! Wth! Seriously!?! I've been waiting for a Cheesecake Factory to open up around here and my first encounter sucked!!! My workers have already gone to this location and say it's slow and sucks!

She removed our appetizer without even asking if we were done. The only semi-bright spot was the manager Mark. He kept coming over apologizing and trying to make things better but things never really improved. After waiting an hour for a table,  another hour for our appetizers we canceled our meal and headed to the bakery for cheesecake to go.  That took another 30 mins. There were four employees standing around while we waited. I will never come back to this location. I've been to others and love this chain.

768,Melissa G.,"Cerritos, CA",23,31,,4.0,2015-11-07,"We went to this location last since the grand opening on Wednesday. The location is better than most. They were very very busy our wait time was 45 minutes which is the usual at any cheese cake factory. Our waiter was Pedro  he was amazing! He recommended an appetizer and offered to review the menu with us. He was very funny yet professional. Our appetizer was delicious! We had the fried zucchini. The order was taking longer than usual, it was understandable for the amount of people they had waiting. We waited about 45 minutes for our food. By the time it arrived we had lost our appetite. I don't know what issues they were having for not bringing the food orders on time, we were not the only ones waiting another couple next to us were getting very frustrated. I just hope they fix the food wait time because this location is closer to home I would hate to drive to the one in Brea. There were also a lot of waiters by the bar area and they didn't know what they were doing, they kept bumping into each other and asking what tables the drinks go to. It didn't seam very organized. There were 5 girls inside the booth were they take down your name they were so crowded it looked very unprofessional. I am still giving this location a 4 because despite of all that Pedro over shadowed all my frustrations. If it wasn't for Pedro our night would have been ruined he was polite and kept us updated on our food order every 10 minutes and always offered to bring more drinks or bread. I hope this location gets it together and makes it big!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=760,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.4480000000000004

The taste was really bland. The sour dough bread was tough.  I will definitely come back in a few months and give them another try.  The location is perfect since it is inside the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=640,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152

And we started to wait from 18:30, and be seated at around 19:45, which was more than one hour for the table. We ordered 4 plates, and they spent almost half an hour to make only 3 dishes!! And the last plate took another 20mins to came out! Obliviously they were too busy and they forgot it! And one of us just started her dinner after three of us had completed out meals. Finally they offered us free cakes for the long time wait. Still they have long way to go! You have to state your request to the server twice to get served, you will surely run out of your patience not only for waiting for table and food, but also for service!!

Even my girlfriend finished her food before I could even have anything to eat. Man, I don't care if you guys just opened, you guys should be prepared for a dinner rush. Your food should be consistent and BOMB. Get your shit together please. Also, a complimentary cheesecake shouldn't be the only factor at making a customer happy. Unlike others, you cant buy my loyalty through a free dessert. Sorry. Not Sorry. ALSO, Their should be communication between the manager and the customer, when a customer isn't satisfied.

Our appetizer came out great and delicious with the dipping sauces.  I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and substituted for sweet potato fries. Our server first was a bit slow yet I was being considerate being that it's still in its opening weeks. The fries came out a little salty and the sandwich tasted great. My brother ordered the catfish plate and man, it was soft and fresh.  For dessert, we ordered a slice of vanilla bean cheesecake.

427,Elizabeth N.,"Lakewood, CA",4,29,7.0,4.0,2015-11-09,"Never been to this restaurant before, so it was a real treat for my 5 year anniversary with the boyfriend. My first impression was that the main entrance was poorly designed and you had to push past a crowed of people waiting to buy a cheesecake to-go just to get to the reception desk. Once you were checked in, there is no where to sit since the seat are back past the crowed of cheesecake buyers and the receptionist asks you to 'step to the side' by the wall and wait while for a waiter to come get you. But to be fair, this place just opened up and most of the staff are rushing around to get everyone seated. Very crowded. Though, we were not given the option of sitting inside since they automatically took us outside. Which isn't outside, but in the hallway of the mall where people walk by from store to store.  :c The only thing that save this experience so far was the friendly staff, good food and great cheesecake. I ordered the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic, so darn good and had a large potion left over for another meal. Doesn't seem to pricey when you get so much food.

Got there at 9:30pm and had to call twice because the first time I was put on hold 5 min.  Finally got a hold of someone and then it took them 15 min to bring me my order. This defeats the purpose of curb side. Then when the lady came out to give me my order she had to go back in to get my cheesecake!  So in totally I had to sit in my car waiting for my order for 30 min!  What's the point of curb side and ordering ahead if you have to wait as long as you would inside the restaurant. And then to top it off, I ordered my usual, the crusted chicken Romano and asked for Alfredo sauce on the side. They gave me my sauce in a little tiny container, the same size they use for the butter. What the heck was I doing to do with that amount of sauce for my whole order?  My pasta was also under cooked. What a horrible experience. I can see many people have experienced the same bad service and bad food. What a disappointment.

We were seated within 15 minutes, outside patio, very nice, heaters kept the area comfortable. It took 15 minutes before a server came to our table, took our drink order and brought us bread. Then another 15 minutes before coming back to take our order. To make a long story short, from the time our order was taken it took over an hour before we received our meals. The food was cold, my pasta was in a big ball and mashed potatoes were cold and hard on the top. Didn't want to send anything back because we had already waited for a long time. Forgot to mention that during the hour and a half our server went off shift. We ate our dinner and then was rushed to make a dessert selection, which we asked to have it to go. It took another 20 minutes for the server to return with our desserts and our check. We paid in cash, which we normally don't like just leaving on the table but after 15 more minutes the server didn't come to the table for payment so we just left. Having been to the Cheesecake Factory's on the East Coast, this location has a lot to improve. The entrance area is too crowded and difficult to get to the check-in desk. The sun shines through the front door,  the Check-in girl couldn't even see, she had to talk to us with a menu in front of her face to deflect the sun. Very Poor design. The Cheesecake is the best!

We finally get to order, then I was told that what I ordered off of the menu was not available? After 2 hours of wasted time, my soup arrives to the table COLD!!!! I could not take it anymore and asked to speak to the manager. Frank (the manager?) arrives and was immediately defensive. ""So what's the problem?"" he says.  Really Frank? I am the customer! Whatever happened to hello, how can I help you?  The problem is that your staff is inadequate, my food is cold and your attitude is stank! ""Anything else?"" he says as if I did something to him. No that will be it! Thank you for ruining my birthday! Yes, it was my birthday! No apology, no concern that you have customers waiting in line to complain to you about their poor experience in YOUR restaurant.

579,Chris M.,"Lakewood, CA",211,11,2.0,2.0,2015-11-15,"My friends and I came to have a later dinner on Saturday 11/14/15 around 10pm. I am definitely disappointed in the training and customer service aspect of this new location.  First and foremost, I had a bad impression on this location from the moment I walked up to the host to put our name down. There were two young girls at the counter, neither of them looking up to acknowledge their surroundings. As I reached the counter, I had to get the hostess attention to put our name down. Along with that, the other girl turns around and interrupts and begins to rant and talk about how rude customers are. I will quote ""customers are so F***ing rude."" Off the bat, I already knew that I was not going to enjoy this dinner. Any worker should absolutely not put down or talk about another customer in work place, especially in front of another customer. A host can be seen as the face and first impression of a restaurant. The good thing is that we were seated within 5 mins having that it was late at night and slow.  Secondly, I would say our service was mediocre. It was not too bad, but definitely could be way better. I think it primarily goes around the training aspect and evaluating if the server is qualified and ready to be put out there. I could tell that our server lacked the training and experience. In the very beginning she could not remember our drink orders and had to come back to us to reconfirm even though I did see her write it down, also I had requested only wheat bread but she had to come back for that as well thinking that we only wanted sourdough. The only good thing that I experienced was the food itself, it came out in a timely matter and was delicious. Our server did check up on us every so often; however it was a quick ""everything ok?"" while passing by. It did not seem very genuine and time caring. At the end of the meal, we wanted to pay with two cards; however we asked to put only a certain amount on one card and the rest on my card. The server claimed that they can only do half/half with the cards, which even I know is wrong. I always go to your Bella terra and Brea locations and done it before. So I insisted to the server that I am pretty sure you guys can do that and she said she will try. It is ridiculous that a server does not even know the basics. At the end she was able to charge us under our requests. Lastly, a server should not grab the signed check with tip until a party leaves as for this is what she did.  Though I was very excited about a cheesecake factory opening up at a closer location to me, I am utterly disappointed. I honestly would rather go to your further locations. I think that the all the workers need a proper retraining and the management team needs to be able to identify or reevaluate ones capabilities and qualifications. Your employees are the face of your restaurant and are the ones servicing the customers directly. I do understand that they have not even been open for a month yet, but that is no excuse in my opinion. You should not open a restaurant if the team is not ready. Im not sure if they did this, but it would be a good idea to bring in experienced workers from a different location into a new restaurant for a smoother opening and better first impression to the customers. So in order to have a good business and a good reputation, it is important that the team knows the meaning of service and simply how to execute them",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=560,2.24,2.24,2.24,2.408,2.24

I was tired after work and saw online that this CF had curbside takeout so I decided to call in an order for dinner for myself and my son. Called, placed my order and the woman assisting me told me I could pull in to one of their dedicated curbside takeout spots or pull into a side alley if all the spots were taken and someone would come right out with my food. Arrived right when they told me my order would be ready and called to let them know all the curbside spots were taken and I was driving around trying to figure out where to park since the alley I was told about was nowhere to be found. The woman on the phone ""umm'd"" and ""ahh'd"" and seemed flustered. She didn't know what to tell me and then said ""we're really busy"". Yeah, not something I want or need to hear as I'm circling and circling. She puts me on hold and while I'm on hold a curbside spot opens up and I park. When I'm connected again, I explained again that I'm here to pick up my order and where I'm parked. I tell her specifically that I've brought exact change so they can bring my food right out.  I wait another 10 mins and someone comes out but he didn't bring my food. I ask him why he didn't bring the food since I have exact change and I had told the woman over the phone that I did and he said no one notified him. So after I pay he had to go all the way back to get my food. I wait another almost 10 mins and finally get my food. When I get home and finally tuck into the chicken salad sammy with my son, I notice immediately there are no almonds in the salad (the chix salad is supposed to have almonds). So to add to the bad pickup experience, my sandwich wasn't even prepared correctly. Womp, womp. I get that this is a brand new location, but unless they work on their communication and make sure only those customers picking up are really utilizing their curbside parking spots (I looked at all the cars in the curbside spots and none of them had people inside waiting for their takeout), I won't ever be ordering takeout from this CF again.

743,Keeshunna D.,"Lynwood, CA",123,7,1.0,1.0,2015-11-17,"Where do I start. So my husband and I went to this Cheesecake Factory 2 days ago for our Anniversary. Upon our arrival we were told the wait would be an hour and a half. They gave us a pager and told us that it would work in the mall,so we left to go shopping. I was completely surprised when the pager went off just 30 minutes later. When we got back to the restaurant and checked in at the front desk, the hostess instructed us to stand to the side and we would be seated. While waiting there, i see multiple tickets being printed out which I presume were names of the people who had checked in. Us included. I was a little put off, because the young lady pulling the ticket felt that it was more important for her to finish her conversation, than to do her job. After which she stated that we would be sitting outside.  I found this odd, since they had plenty of seating in their ""outdoor area"" inside the mall. It was very cold that night, and I would think that they wouldn't sit anyone out there before filling up every other option. But no. There we were, trying to warm ourselves up by the heaters while waiting for the server. The waitress addressed us and took our order relatively fast. My husband wanted a turkey burger, but apparently there are no turkey patties being served at Cheesecake Factory locations due to a shortage. So he requested a grilled chicken breast instead, since that was still on the menu. The appetizer took over 45 minutes to come out, and when it did it was wrong.  We ordered a chicken quesadilla. We received a cheese quesadilla with a bunch of onions and chilis on it. When we were able to flag our waitress down to tell her it was wrong, she offered to bring chicken on the side. We told her no thank you and sent it back.  I'm getting really frustrated at this point. Finally our food arrives 45 minutes after we sent the appetizer back. I ordered Crusted Chicken Romano. At first glance, you could see that the pasta was dry and the chicken pieces were not only tiny, but the batter did not look completely cooked. My husband's chicken patty was half the size of the bread in diameter. I was so hungry at this point that I still tried to eat the food. Upon tasting a spoonful of my pasta, i realized i wouldnt be able to eat the rest. The noodles tasted like they had been partially cooked the day before and placed in the frigde to be warmed up again for my meal. There was only a spoonful of sauce, which was not enough to hide the horrible taste of the noodles or the chicken. I reached over to get a try my husband's food, only to find out his fries did not come out with his sandwich, and the sandwich was cold. By this time we had had it. We asked our waitress to send or food back and call the manager. It took him a while to get out there, but once he did, I was more displeased than ever by his completely aloof dimmeaner. He just apologized for the food and said he would remove it from the bill. This made no since, because there shouldn't be a bill....at that point the only thing we had consumed was water and bread. He didn't try to offer an explanation or free desert, nothing. Just "" I see that you sent your quesadilla back and later your food, we are sorry that you didn't like it"". How about how can we make this up to you? This was the worst experience I have ever had at a Cheesecake Factory, and judging by the experience of others while we were there and the reviews I just read about this location, we are not the only ones that feel this way. I feel sorry for anyone who go there for their first visit to the Cheesecake Factory. They will never go back....to any location. They won't know how good it can be. We left and went to another restaurant, but I had lost my appetite, and our night was ruined.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=740,2.4,2.4,2.4,2.244,2.4
145,Timmy S.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",503,1624,2998.0,3.0,2015-11-18,"I arrived here for an early lunch right after they opened. From 11-12, the time I was here, the place was not crowded at all - plenty of empty tables. Located on the back side of Los Cerritos Center next to Forever 21, this place is huge with a large outdoor patio plus several tables along the side of the restaurant inside the mall. I ordered a tropical iced tea to drink and the Carolina BBQ Pork Sandwich with a green salad.  The service here was excellent (until the end; more on that later) - very attentive with a smile. The kitchen, however, was painfully slow. It took a long time for my food to come out (close to 30 minutes) considering the place wasn't busy. Luckily my waitress brought me some delicious warm bread to keep me from being overly antsy. The green salad was dullsville - only greens with one slice of tomato. The pork sandwich was good. To quote the menu, it consisted of ""Tender Pulled Pork, Crispy Bacon, and Slow Roasted Applewood Smoked Bacon Topped with Creamy Cole Slaw on a Grilled Bun with Pickles and B.B.Q. Sauce."" I have to admit that it tasted as good as the description sounds although it doesn't come close to rivaling pulled pork you'd get at a legit BBQ place.  Since this was Cheesecake Factory of course I needed to get some cheesecake even though I'm not much of a cheesecake person. I ordered a seasonal flavor - pumpkin pecan. She screwed up and brought me a regular pumpkin but I didn't notice until I'd taken a bite. I could have sent it back but I liked the pumpkin enough not to bother. It did have FAR too much whipped cream though.  Although I had a decent meal here I won't be back anytime soon due to prices on everything being too high and because cheesecake isn't my favorite thing in the world.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=140,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.444,2.48

So another 10 mins goes by and a little upset, I went to a different host who then checked for our name and said she didnt receive our pager. They sat us immediately after seeing that we did give them our pager. Our server Nicole came by to greet us, she was quite friendly and told us if we needed anything to just call for her. She saod she was going to come back shortly with bread and clearly forgot because she never came back. Welll... I didn't see nicole at all til AFTER I finished my meal. She was no where in sight and we had 5 different people help us. I understand this restaurant is new, but I think I'm better off going to the one in bella tierra.

Since it's Thanksgiving break, we assumed the mall would be busy since everyone is trying to do their Black Friday pre-sale shopping. It was pretty exciting to finally have a Cheesecake Factory nearby, though.  We came in and the wait time was 50 minutes. Fortunately, the range of the beeper let us walk around the mall in the meantime so the wait wasn't so bad. We sat down and didn't wait long for our server. We asked for extra time to look at the menu, so she got us water. It took four servers to get straws for our water.  We ordered the fettuccini Alfredo with chicken, and a strawberry cheesecake for dessert. The alfredo sauce was okay, and the chicken was bland. The strawberry cheesecake was really good, and I totally recommend it.  Overall, the service was slow and it could use some improvement. The food was decent.

I was so excited to hear they had just opened a week before my birthday. On the day of, my family took me here to celebrate my special day. This location is huge and very beautiful. I was extremely excited to get the party started. We entered the restaurant and my heart dropped. OMG! people were packed everywhere! Didn't expect to see so many people due to the patio area being almost empty. My sister checked in and the hostess said it would be a 55 to 90 minute wait. Ugh! She asked if we wanted indoors or out and we said which ever comes first. So as we're waiting we decide to take a walk in the mall. If it wasn't for the mall, I think we would have left.  What I can say. The service was excellent!. All of the employee's went out of their way to make sure you were satisfied. This is where it goes down hill. Our waitress asked if we wanted bread? Doesn't everyone? She came back informed us that they ran out of bread and will bring us some once in comes out of the oven. Hmm? Not starting off so well. We ordered appetizers with our meals and they brought them to the table one a time. I thought that was odd. As we started to eat, the waitress came back and told us that they had ran out of salmon but had enough for a lunch size plate, if we were okay with that? Great! What's next. Minutes later our plates started to arrive before we were even finish with the appetizers, as we're pushing plates all over the table just to make room. Really? Now I'm starting to get annoyed! Lets get your timing down people! By the time we got to the main dishes, they were all cold. There's nothing worse then a lukewarm/cold meal. I refused to eat mine but instead of making a big deal, I had the waitress to pack it up for me to go. As I'm looking across the table while my sister is eating, I notice her boyfriend still waiting on his lunch size dinner. OMG!! They forgot! The waitress came over again and apologized. She said she didn't like what the salmon had looked like, so she had them to make him another dinner. So all of a sudden, you have more salmon? Come on guy's! It was one thing after the other. Before we left the waiters came over to sing me happy birthday. Happy I wasn't but I will go back because I know they just need time to get it together!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=500,2.56,2.56,2.56,2.572,2.56

The Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken was overcooked so she ordered another one for us. She went on her break and when she came back from her break we were still waiting for our Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken. She informed her manager, Mark, who came to our table and spoke to us. Mark took full responsibility of the situation even though he was not directly responsible for cooking it and not delivering it in a timely manner. You don't find too many managers that will own up or take ownership of the problem. We truly appreciate that Mark took ownership of the issue.

She said the current wait time was 2 hours. We told her patio or inside seating was okay, I thought it would be quicker that way. We ended up waiting.  So it's been 1 hour and something minutes, I go up and ask the hostess how long we have left. She tells us ""for a party of 4, you still have 45 minutes left"" We told her in the beginning we were a party of 3... I don't know if her adding 1 more person made our wait time longer but whatever I just corrected her and said I had a party of 3 and then told her if she can just make it a party of 2 (my dad left, and couldn't wait 2 hours).  After we told her we were a party of 2, 5 minutes later our beeper buzzes. Thank god.  Once we got seated, it took about 10 minutes for our server to come and introduce herself. She asked what we wanted to drink. Our drinks came our really quick, she even gave us bread. What took so long is for her to finally ask what we wanted to order. So for like 30 minutes we were just drinking our drinks and eating bread. Long story short this place takes forever! Went in at 5pm came out at 8pm. A majority of that time we were just waiting! I'm glad I didn't get any attitudes from any of the workers just like the past reviewers got, which is why I gave them 2 stars. The wait time is just terrible. We were so full from eating bread that we hardly even touched our food. We ate for like 10 minutes and asked if they could wrap up our food for to go.  So sad about this place. It's the closest Cheesecake Factory to me. Hopefully they improve, will probably come and check it out again in like 3 months or so. Hopefully that is enough to time to get them all trained.  Also tried their cheesecake and soooo sweet. I recommend sharing. P.s. They don't put napkin or anything under their silverware.

From getting our drink orders wrong, to taking more than 1hr to get our food out to having 2 out of 4 meals come out completely horrible. My poor daughter ordered the chicken tenders and fries and once it arrived they tasted horrible, both the tenders and fries had a strong fish taste. We asked the waited to let her switch her meal to the pizza instead and he kindly agreed but it got there almost 45 minutes later, she had to sit there and watch us all eat. I ordered the spicy cashew chicken and it was drowning in sauce, way too salty and saucy to eat. We never got asked if we wanted our drinks refreshed and once we asked for the bill that also took 25 minutes to get! I went to ask for a manager and spoke to Mike. Mike was very nice and was very sorry for the service and food.

We were all really hungry so we decided to make the best of it.  We ordered our food and drinks from one server who kept forgetting to bring what we asked for, then he said we got a new server, she was pretty nice. You could tell they were overwhelmed, all servers where all over the place and since we were near the kitchen you could see a lot of servers standing around not actually doing anything..so that was confusing. It made sense why our food took FOREVER to come out. Again the sodas kept getting forgotten to get refilled after asked for. There was a whole restaurant blackout in the beginning of our dinner but luckily the server said our order went in before the blackout.  All in all, the food was good...as expected, no complaint there. The service and waiting time was the problem. At the end we wanted to order dessert but were scared that it would take 20 minutes just to get a piece of cheesecake since this is how long it took to get the check after we asked for it.  We gave our comments to the server who actually went to tell the manager because he came to our table to check before we left. He gave us a complimentary slice of cheesecake.

I questioned her opinion on the bad reviews on yelp (I can understand and sympathize with them, when a new restaurant opens the cooks, chefs, wait staff are all NEW to everything, I think the public should be more understanding and patient. Honestly, they are lucky I understand bc anybody else would have had a fit what I endured yesterday on my birthday dinner.  My sister and I arrived early before my guests to get a table. We were told that it will be a few minutes, they'll give me an estimated time. Great, I will be at the bar. Mike was suppose to tell me how long it was going to be, (possibly manager) he told me he was new about 4 days. While I sipped my Pinot Grigio that Jenny served me (excellent bar tender, Tony is also fantastic, they work alongside & compliment each other) mike was walking by the bar, I'm thinking there he is, he's going to tell me how long the wait is but he was just walking along the bar to the kitchen. Uh oh, I must of been forgotten. My guests arrived after trying to FiND the restaurant around the big mall, I got lost myself...they were surprised there was no table yet. We arrived about 6:45pm, got seated at 8:20pm or so... An hour passes and nothing, mind you I'm at the bar with my boyfriend and so is my sister with our friend so we didn't mind so much but my grandma and mother were already wanting to leave....They told me the people had boxes to go, and paid but were camping out talking and weren't leaving. He was nice enough to give me a banana bc they were out of bread to give to my elderly grandmother who has diabetes, I was worried for her...So we waited and waited until the thing buzzed.  We were approached right away by Kevin, great server, boxed our food to go and all. I ordered three appetizers: stuffed mushrooms which looked a bit sad and small, ate them bc we were starving, ordered the sweet con tamale cakes, everyone loved them, and asked what appetizer he recommends, avocado egg roll, this one didn't make it to the table, wonder if he wrote down my third choice. They were out of calimari. Nooooo! My bf did ask if we had another appetizer coming, I forgot to inquire about it after conversing, and opening presents and him talking my ear out of his lovely thoughts about things.. We start ordering, I ordered the chicken chipotle pasta, it wasnt as as spicy as I wanted it to be but delicious, different noodles would have satisfied me though instead of a penne, it had a nice crunchy texture w the tortilla strips they embellish it with. The bf ordered the guacamole salad, it was spicy for him. My friend ordered bbq ranch chicken salad, he likes it. It had black beans and avocado, I tried it, it was tasty. My mother had herb crusted salmon, she was pleased but it tasted a bit fishy for me but still good. My sister enjoyed her grilled steak medallions, the mash potato were creamy. My nephew sat quietly while eating his spaghetti and meatballs, I asked if it was good and he nodded yet digging in.  Kevin was attentive at all times, refilling, we didn't have to ask for anything. Bread was suffice for everyone, nice and hot. We tipped 28%. They work hard and have to put up with moody people, luckily we were understanding, well half of us. They brought a cheesecake with a shot of a sundae but had forgot to ask about it on the bill, I was charged for an original cheesecake. We usually order dessert but the big portions filled us up.  Again, we are conversing and my bf knows how to distract me. For 11 people it was $237.67 we tipped $60. It's not the servers fault when there's a wait. Don't take it out on them. It helps that the food is good. The wait is awful but if it's packed it's a good indication something is right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=400,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.316,2.84
745,Angel C.,"Pasadena, CA",0,6,2.0,1.0,2015-12-09,"I love The Cheesecake Factory. I have a high expectation everytime we dine in especially the costumer service. I never had any problems with the mangers, hostess and servers. But this location got the worst service so far. We decided to go there and celebrate my mom's Birthday since its new addition to the mall that's very close to our place. We waited for 45mins to be seated which is already expected. After the waiting time..we seated and our server greeted us. (I forgot his name) with the tone of like he's not happy or excited that we were there. We order our drinks and when came back. He pass me my water and other drinks of my family. When he's distributing the straws. He just toss it infront of me. Near my glass of water. (How rude huh?) So I gave him a look like im waiting for him to say sorry because for me that was very disrespectfull but i didnt hear anything. So we order our entrees and other servers served us are foods and they're all polite and courteous. When our main server came back to refill our drinks and back at the table he just put the glass at the table not looking what will hit it. there are some utensils in the table where he put the glass. So all the utensils flip all over. I gave him a look again. This time he said sorry with his not so sorry voice. But we just calmed and still nice on him the whole time. I am very disappointend on our experience to this new location. We went to this restaurant to celebrate and be happy and have our quality time with the family but that guy changed our mood in a snap. Hopefully the management do some action regarding their employees. Thanks",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=740,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.116,2.68

On our second visit they said the wait time was going to be ""an hour and 45 minutes"" I was like ""I'm sorry did you just say an hour and 45 minutes?"" She said yes. I thought I misheard her.

We waited only 10-20 mins to be seated in their outside patio (we asked for 1st available). It had a great ambience and was well heated which was nice since it was a pretty cold night. Our server was really friendly. She took our drink order fairly quick and offered/provided free bread. Cheesecake Factory has a very overwhelming menu which is something I was already aware of. We decided to share an egg roll sampler that included 4 different types of egg rolls/sauces. Then we decided on 2 different pastas (I forget both the names; his was a chipotle kind and mine had chicken and mushrooms) as our entrees. They were delicious and came in generous portions but by the time we had our pasta we were already pretty full off the egg rolls and bread, so we had a lot of leftovers.  Of course we couldn't leave without ordering a cheesecake. We tried the cookie dough one, which definitely had a lot of cookie dough (and a lot of whipped cream) not my favorite but still good. Overall: - great experience with our server and enjoyed some really good food.

585,Elle V.,"Ontario, CA",161,98,37.0,1.0,2015-12-13,"Let me first start of by saying I am a HUGE Cheesecake Factory fan. I've been in multiple locations in LA as well as in Vegas and the east coast - I'm a FAN. I was so excited when this one opened near my parents. Today happened to be my second time here. First off, the staff has been great for the most part. Always happy, smiling, willing to assist, etc.  On our first time here, I felt so bad, but our waitress looked like she was about to cry. She was incredibly distracted, had to look at your mouth intensely to understand, idk what it was but I was genuinely concerned for her well being. She mentioned she wasn't used to being a Sunday waitress but she just seemed...off. She wasn't sure about the menu and things like that. Our waitress this second time was great, but I do notice that they disappear a lot for long periods of time and only check on you once and disappear again. I noticed the table next to us were getting antsy trying to pay their bill and get out of here.  The food wait though was and IS ridiculous. I thought maybe it was just that one time but here I am, sitting at the table, having spent more than 2 hrs. Just waiting on food. Not to mention that on this visit, my order came out wrong not once but TWICE. Even getting a slice of cheesecake is an additional 20 mins. Our waitress gave me a complimentary soup which was nice. The coffee we ordered was in a To-go cup although we didn't ask for it to be. Our drinks remained unchecked so they were watered down through half the meal and you couldn't even be bothered to ask for fear it would take another 15 mins and you'd have choked by then. Another table just returned one of their plates. The Tuscan chicken was drowning in the balsamic vinaigrette that made the whole plate just sour. It was as if the entree became a soup. Oh and their bread is either hard as a rock or super fresh; on our first visit I had to ask our waitress to replace our batch because it was burnt and overcooked - you might break your tooth! You could hear and see the kitchen staff scrambling and yelling, someone was trying to encourage a faster pace... It's not that they are understaffed for sure but it's as if no one knows what they are doing, there's no sense of organization, no leadership... I've never been a waitress but I can guarantee you I would do a lot better and would hate to get the wrath of customers due to an incompetent kitchen. I'm incredibly incredibly disappointed and don't think I'll be back at this location. I have never had such a horrible experience at a Cheesecake Factory or a restaurant. (p.s. Finally had a bite of my left overs - which was my Chicken Marsala and mushrooms that took over an hr. to get to me and was missing the mushrooms so I never got to really try it since I stuffed my hungry belly with the hard bread and soup down - the chicken is HORRID. Like wth! There's fat on its pieces and feels and tastes rubbery... this is so sad...

The avocado egg rolls were okay... greasy af though. The sauce that comes with it is basically cumin and corn syrup. Made us gag but we got a good laugh out of making people at our table try it and seeing them cringe like when a baby tastes lemon for the first time. Chicken was kind of uncooked.

I can't remember how long it took for our bread and water to get to our table. He told us they were making a new batch of bread which I was stoked about because fresh bread.. Yummy!! I was disappointed that it wasn't like hot, hardly warm so I'm pretty sure it wasn't fresh. Oh whale.  We waited for probably 20 mins for our food to finally arrive.

They need to manage the waiting a lot better.  Sometimes it seems they forget about certain parties, because both times I have gone, i was with a party of three, both times they seated people who came in AFTER us, and they either were couples or small parties, and there was obviously tables able to filled. Its like they skipped us. I think they should use what other restaurants do and do call ahead seating,  especially for such a big time restaurant. Waiting is crazy there. My other issue is the food. First time, wasn't bad food was amazing. Second time, the bread took a while to come out, then the waitress didn't check on us as often (though it was busy for a Tuesday and she had bigger tables to manage so i will let it slide.) Next my mom's plate came first, hot and declicious, my plate and my dad's took longer to come out, all of our dishes should have come at similar times not ten minutes apart.  And ontop of that, my dad's food eneded up being cold, he got the steak tacos. The tacos, the beans and rice were all like they had been sitting out for a while. We told the waitress and she got him a new plate. He got a small ceasar salad as a sorry basically. He got his new plate, but the rice was still meh, everything else was hot and good. My dad couldn't even eat his meal because we had to wait so long for the foos he got full off the bread (they need a new bread choice) and salad. Everyone else's dishes were good.

The steak diane states that it has a mushroom sauce. And then below it the hibachi steak explicitly states it has shiitake mushrooms. I'm allergic to shiitake mushrooms. Having waited some time, I took two bites of my steak diane. As I looked at my medallions, I noticed the mushrooms were a mix of button, but mainly shiitake! I'm now sitting here waiting for my new order as I slowly itch with pain. I even ran to the bathroom to check if I was getting a rash, but there is no where in the restaurant that has bright enough lighting to check. My mother has offered me her meatloaf five times now.

They take it back to the kitchen and in less than 5 minutes brought another burger that was so raw it was bleeding red. So they take it back one more time but it was obvious that they threw it into the microwave which cooked the burger but left the bread soggy and wet.

Let me first start off by saying my ONE star is for the restaurant and the managerial team not based on my waiter or service.  My waiter was excellent, I mean he handled himself well and I felt bad for the poor guy that the system was going down and he was overwhelmingly busy. His name was James from what I can recall and he did everything the best he could. I guess after we ordered the computer system crashed and the kitchen was trying to track down orders? He gave us a free salad while we waited and he didn't have to do that.  Also the restaurant was out of butter for the bread? Really? Um how do you run out of butter?  We finally got our order after sitting and waiting for about 1 hour and 15minutes. And we were missing a part of our order but we didn't care at that point to track it down we just wanted to eat and go home.  Would I come back? Not for a while.

Hostess said it would take 15-20 minutes  12:36 - Arrived at the restaurant with my sister. 12:48 - Got seated. 12:50 - Our waiter, Eddy, brought us our drinks and bread.  12:54 - My mom ordered the pizza/salad lunch special ($12.95), my sister ordered the lunch Luau salad ($10.95), and I ordered the lunch barbecue ranch chicken salad.  12:57 - Asked Eddy for more of the wheat bread 1:04 - Eddy totally forgot about our bread, so I ask him again. 1:10 - I'm pretty sure Eddy forgot again. Trying to track him down to ask him again for the damn bread, but he's nowhere to be found. Eddy.. Where are you? 1:14 - It has now been 10 minutes since I last asked him. Ah, I finally see him... with the bread. Only took 17 minutes but thanks.  1:20 - 26 minutes after we put in our order, we receive our food. 2.5 stars seems fitting, but I don't have the option. I would lean more towards a 2 star experience than 3 though. I don't know if the bread situation was the kitchen's fault or our waiter's, but either way, it shouldn't take that long for bread to come out. My salad was just okay. The corn and beans were undercooked (which could be a personal preference thing), and my chicken was extremely dry. Very very dry. At the end of the meal, my mom had half her mini pizza leftover, so we asked for a togo box and also one for the bread. Eddy brings us a giant pizza box. Mind you, the leftover pizza is maybe 6x3 and he brings us like a 14x14 box. We ask him for a smaller box and he only brings one when we asked him to also bring us a box for the bread.

We got seated on the patio since it was so busy. No biggie. A little chilly out there but what do you expect. The heat lamps worked very well.  As far as food goes we had no complaints. Everything was made perfect except the pasta on one of our dishes was a tad undercooked. But it was still good.  Our waitress was Nicole. She was very attentive and courteous. Service was on point except for a busser who went away to get water refills for us but never came back. Some of the other bussers also lag. We had hella plates and bowls on our table waiting to get taken away but instead of doing that they were setting up other tables. So I just bussed our own table and put our dirty plates and dishes on the clean table next to us. The busser just looked at me like why I was doing that. So I put more dishes on the clean table haha.

WORST restaurant experience probably ever. don't plan to come back. I don't even know why they're so busy and packed when they're service is so poor. why??? reasons below:  1. for a mon night it was super packed. there was a HUGE line JUST to put your name in.  2. for a party of 4 (including myself), we waited for over an hour to be seated  3. we even had to wait a few minutes when our buzzer went off before we could even get seated! (aren't you supposed to be seated right away once it goes off?!)  4. we waited for at LEAST 10 minutes before i had to flag a server down to tell them NO server had greeted us to ask what we would like to drink (like ALL normal eateries do).  5. not to mention the waiter who finally came to us was already helping the table to the right of us, left of us AND in front of us.  6. our waters came with no straws. so I had to ask a different waiter (once again) to bring us straws.  7. our bread finally came another 20 min or so later AFTER we got seated. 8. there was a couple to the left of us who came in AFTER we got seated. they got their bread and water BEFORE we did earlier. they ALSO got their food AFTER we had already ordered. so two plates of food were served before ANY of us 4 got our plates. (rather ridiculous)  9. I got so full from the bread, I only ate half my meal when it FINALLY came out! (another 20-30 min wait for just our food)  10. another waiter came by to take over and was hardly attentive to us. she came maybe once to ask if we were ok. (she was so fake and insincere)  11. she boxed our food and never brought it back till I had to flag (yet again!) ANOTHER waiter down to ask for it 12. the waiter even asked if we had room for dessert. we reply no. then she says: ""how do you come to Cheesecake Factory and NOT get cheesecake?!"" my response: ""well if our food didn't take so long and I wasn't so full from the bread because of the wait, I probably would've had room for some.""  13. for having at least 50+ waiters on the floor, you would THINK they would be a bit more attentive  so there ya go. 13 reasons tonight why I'm never coming back. although this IS the closest cf to me, I would gladly drive farther to the brea or grove one for better service, better food, and a better atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=400,1.56,2.39,2.39,1.7000000000000002,2.0580000000000003

I never had to ask for a refill nor did my family have to ask, James knew what we needed. That to me was impressive.

Then the waiter told my friend they ran out of veggie burgers when it's the most simple thing to make.

598,Heather M.,"Norwalk, CA",17,5,3.0,3.0,2015-12-31,My friend and I were so excited to see the Cheesecake Factory was finally coming to Cerritos! Last night we decided to finally go and dine there. First off yes the mall was crowded which led us to believe the wait would be a little longer. However for a party of two we waited 50 minutes to be seated. Ridiculous. Seeing that we had to go up and ask them when we were up and low and behold magically we were next..(funny how that works out. I think we were skipped or forgotten) but still we give credit due to them being busy. We go to get seated and we are seated out on the atrium and they try to seat us at a tiny table with NO room to be comfortable at all seeing that the wall is halfway through the table area which limits your seating. We kindly ask to be moved. And the hosted totally does.  Once situated at the new table I look down and I'm kinda disturbed that the utensils are just placed directly on the table and not on a clean napkin.   So let's get down to the nitty gritty. And the truth of it all. Our waiter Marcos was absolutely and I mean absolutely amazing. Not only was he honest about him trying foods he was very attentive to us. He made us feel as though we were his only table. Even though he had many! I have food allergies and he was very quick to answer my questions and when he didn't know he ran to the kitchen to find out and was back very quickly! You can tell he loved and took pride in his job. At the end of our meal he asked us for our honest feedback. And we told him. The mushrooms were not as good as other cheesecake factories and the samosas were way over fired. The Parmesan garlic bread was alright. The avocado egg rolls were fantastic till I pulled a whole spring of rosemary out of my mouth. The salad was good and the mushroom soup was lovely.  So overall we gave him honest feed back and I'm passing it on to you all. It wasn't enough to cry to a manager about. We understand it's a new kitchen new staff and busy. I took my entree home and let me tell you. Do not order the fettuccine Alfredo unless you love oil and noodles. I had to throw it out.  So anyways if your ok with mediocre food but want super above the top service. Then I suggest that you ask for Marcos to wait on you and have patience with the kitchen. They will get better. I hope Cheesecake Factory will get in the swing of things and make the food as perfect as the service.  If I could do two start ratings I would give 5 for Marcos and his excellent service. However with food. It would be closer to a 1-2 So with that. I will give three stars because Marcos really made our dining experience awesome.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=580,1.8,2.39,2.39,1.7400000000000002,2.1540000000000004

We will be back.  I would suggest to be prepared to arrive early due to the growing popularity and possible wait times. Update: unfortunately I had to remove 1 star rating since after the review was posted, server never asked once to refill our drinks and it took an additional 20 mins just to get the check.

268,Brett S.,"Lakewood, CA",68,118,42.0,1.0,2015-12-31,"I gave an additional star because the wait was much less than expected and what they quoted. First off, this place is a madhouse! There was a 10 minute wait in line just to put our names in. We were quoted 30, walked around and were seated within 20. Unfortunately I was disappointed with the service and it appears they are under-staffed for the demand. My appetizer came out after my main course and while I no longer wanted it just had them box it up. I got the herb crusted salmon with a Guinness and the salmon was pretty good but slightly charred and chewy. Server only came back once to check on us in the 40 minutes we were waiting and ended up grabbing our own menu for dessert to check it out. Pretty disappointed with this one. I'll give it a few months and give them another shot. Update: I changed my mind from my prior review and decided they are only worthy of 1 star. Our service was awful. Only had our server come up twice and even had to wait 5 more minutes for him to return after dropping off our check even though we had it ready when he came by the first time.

259,Paul C.,"Cerritos, CA",42,364,503.0,2.0,2015-12-31,"When I heard about Cheesecake Factory finally coming to Cerritos, I said it's about damn time. But what I got tonight was a not so stellar experience that makes me not want to eat here again. This place was definitely not built for a massive crowd especially tonight with too many people out to eat. My family and I thought we would come here early and get dinner for my mom's bday and be on our way. We ended up staying here for nearly 2 and a half hours from the long line just to get your name down all the way to getting our food out. I was a bit unhappy about where we got seated. We were a party of 4 and got seated out in the little patio area inside the mall. Sure it was nice and bright compared to the dim light setting inside but it was a little awkward for me to eat out in the open mall where all the shoppers were. Eddie was our server for the night. Things started off alright but after getting our drink orders down, it took over 10 minutes to get our drinks out as well as the bread. Almost thought he forgot about us since we weren't seated inside. I ordered the chicken madeira and steak diane combo but the description on the steak diane failed to mention that they added shiitake mushrooms which I absolutely despise. Also one of the asparagus that I got for the chicken madeira was not properly cooked as I had the most difficult time chewing on it and could not bite a piece of it off. Very disappointed with that. Here's what really didn't go well with me. The table settings. Who in their damn mind decided that it's ok to put silverware on a table without a napkin resting in between? Why does the napkin have to be on the little plate? My plate was a little dirty btw as I noticed some crumbs already on it. The table setting sucks and needs to be changed. Restrooms here are questionable too. Why do the doors need to weigh 1000 pounds? And no paper towels either. Ugh. Do they really think air dryers are the better choice? And the dim setting inside is another thing. I nearly slipped because their floors were covered in grease and oil from their food hitting the floor and making it hard to tell. Food and service were both mediocre and I wouldn't come back here especially since it took so much of my time. I would only return for their cheesecakes only to go. In conclusion time it took from start to finish Line for getting your name down - 10 minutes Waiting for a table for a party of 4 - 1 hour 5 minutes Getting water/bread - 10+ minutes Getting entrees - 50 minutes Getting check - 7 minutes",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=240,1.84,2.41,2.41,1.704,2.1820000000000004
291,Gretchen B.,"Long Beach, CA",4,25,49.0,3.0,2015-12-31,"Visited yesterday around 5pm and I thought I would wait awhile to get seated. Surprisingly, I was wrong! There was plenty of seats in the ""atrium"" area which is the outdoor seating inside the mall.  +1 star for seating me within 5 minutes. Our table was clean and napkins were nicely placed on top of the plates. However, our seats had crumbs of food on it. Also, it's disgusting having our utensils placed directly on the table tops. The last customers could have sneezed or coughed on the tables. Plus, they don't disinfect the tables after each customer (I saw the waiters briefly wipe the tables down with dry clothes). Make sure to wipe down the seats and disinfect too! -2 stars Food came out promptly and it was perfectly seasoned. They grated fresh parmesan cheese on my pasta which elevated the flavor of the sauce.

Ordered a slice of Tiramisu Cheesecake to go. I get there and I am told they're unfortunately out of Tiramisu cheesecake, and please check the case and pick something else.  I go to the case and think I'm being punked... there's 3/4 of a cheesecake that looks like Tiramisu cheesecake. And right in front of it is a sign that says, ""Tiramisu cheesecake.""   I go back to the cashier, tell her there's a cheesecake that looks like Tiramisu, and is labeled Tiramisu. She Doesn't believe me, and looks and sees it herself. She then informs me that it ""isn't in the computer, so I can't sell it."" They informed me that the cheesecake was still frozen, and that was why it wasn't in the computer yet.  Instantly I wondered where the missing 4 slices of that 3/4 of a cheesecake went, if they too weren't in the computer.   I had no backup choice so I told her I'd take the frozen piece anyway. And the wheels of how to buy a piece of cheesecake that was in front of me, close enough to touch began to turn.  So I waited for a manager. And waited. They came up with a solution. Someone would enter just slice into the computer and then we would instantly buy it, so the rest of the frozen cheesecake didn't accidentally get sold. This process apparently is very difficult to do. In fact I got to the point where I could no longer wait for the slice to be entered into the computer. So I came up with a great solution: Sell me anything, any other slice, and just PUT a piece of the Tiramisu cheesecake in the box.  High level stuff here you know, swapping one piece of Cheesecake on an order slip for another piece. While I waited I saw another upset customer ask to speak to a manager. The manager never appeared, and after 15 minutes my swapped piece of frozen Tiramisu was ready. Not sure if the manager ever came by; I'm not entirely sure this place has *any* management actually.  To complete the act I was warned that since the cheesecake was frozen it would take a half hour to 45 minutes to thaw. I got home in 5 minutes and discovered, SHOCKINGLY, the cheesecake was not frozen at all.  ETA: I get it, this place sells cheesecake, they don't build rockets.

On a busy Sunday evening, I wasn't surprised by the wait (60-90) minutes, but the wait turned into 2 hours PLUS an additional 25 minutes after our pager went off just to be seated. I actually had to speak to a manager just to get us seated at that point. We ordered 2 large Caesar salads as appetizers which arrived AFTER our main courses-we sent those back since our main dishes were already there. Two of our orders were wrong and needed to be remade, one of those dishes didn't arrive until most of us were already done with our meals. When the bill arrived, it included the appetizers that had been sent back and we had been charged twice for the meal that needed to be remade!

The whole process from the time you give your parties info to the time you get the check was a disaster. The server would bring out each item then disappear with out finding out of we needed something, and it was something as simple as a fork. When my family and I received our food it was in sessions, not to mention the food was warm to the point of almost being cold. Not to mention we had to wait for the things we asked for before eating our meal so by the time we did eat our food it was pretty much cold. The whole time I just watched the staff run around like chickens with no heads I felt like pulling the manager to the side for a pep talk to get the staff in order. Me and my family spent a total of 3 and a half hours here. An hour and a half waiting to be seated and 2 hours just to eat. The fact of the matter is the Cheesecake Factory has been around for a long time and there aren't many around. I feel like they need to staff the whole place with ppl worthy of serving the food that we all know is fantastic. The staff there are gonna give this place a bad rep at this location.

Overall experience: service was terrific, food was meh. Our server was all smiles, checked in with us often, and was quick to cater to our requests. The food on the other hand was just ok. Both of the dishes we got were extremely salty. We ordered the margherita pizza and the Renee's special (chicken-almond salad sandwich with baked potato soup and salad). While the soup and salad were okay, a single bite into my sandwich was all I could handle. It was so salty that I needed to take a huge gulp of water. The same went for the margherita pizza, salty. We also ordered the avocado eggrolls as an appetizer, which was actually pretty good and the highlight of our meal.

After getting our table, and looking through the massive book of a menu, I finally ordered just a simple chicken pasta.  Now waiting for food seemed like an eternity.

As I stated in a past review, my issue with this place is despite the number of times I've visited (multiple locations)...I've yet to find a dish besides appetizers and cheesecakes that I liked nor can recommend to others when asked. Due to this, I decided to keep it simple with a sandwich and it was actually decent.  This marks the first time I've come across a dish here that I liked and would order again. This came in the form of the grilled chicken and avocado club. The chicken was moist and flavorful. There was also a nice portion of avocado on the sandwich. This was nowhere near as hefty as other plates here. If there's anything The Cheesecake Factory does right, it's serve large portions but my sandwich was enjoyable and that's what counts more to me. Since I have family that really loves this place and I mean really really loves this place (cough cough, my brother & mom) I know another visit is inevitable.

Next there was a long line to get to the hostess which was 15 minutes wait when getting to the hostess they took our name and stated another 20 minutes to request for a pager for the hour in half wait. Once getting paged waited another 10 minutes so they can seat us outside  on the heated balcony which was fine minus my heater was broken and we had a baby and toddler with us.

Waitress was helping another table and quickly introduced herself from another  She returned to take drink orders , wasn't anything special about her presence but I'm fine with that until I asked about the chicken samosas since I've never had them here I wanted to make sure they were made traditionally.

My first & only visit to The Cheesecake Factory was almost a decade & a half ago at the Redondo Beach location.  A nice al fresco dinner overlooking the marina made for a  romantic evening.  Fast forward to today, and my mall, the Los Cerritos Center, now has the honor of having the latest brand spanking new location, located in the former wing of the old Nordstrom's location next to Forever 21. Entering through the mall entrance, an art deco theme greeted the bustling lunch crowd of this latest local eatery.   Diners are welcomed with complimentary bread (wheat & sourdough) & butter. After browsing the small plates, snacks & appetizers, I decided upon the eggroll sampler- A plate of all Cheesecake Factory's eggrolls, the eggroll sampler consisted of avocado, Tex Mex, Crispy Cuban & Firecracker Salmon, including accompanying sauces.   Tex Mex - spicy chicken, corn, black beans, peppers, onions & melted cheese Crispy Cuban - slow roasted pork, ham, melted Swiss, pickles & mustard Firecracker Salmon - My second favorite, with spiced salmon rolled in spinach Avocado - My absolute favorite, with avocado, sun-dried tomato, red onion & cilantro.  The thick chunks of avocado provided unctuous creaminess with each bite.  I also preferred the tamarind-cashew dipping sauce, using it the most of all four. Service was good.  My attendant made a mistake with my change, but was quick & apologetic.  Seating seems ample with booths.  On the mall side, there is an ""al fresco"" area to enjoy the cool, crisp mall air.  Good to people to watch & for people to watch you.  Harkins Theatre is soon to open next door, making dinner & a movie a snap. Parking is at the Los Cerritos Center.  The dedicated entrance for The Cheesecake Factory is next to Forever 21, located on the 605 freeway side of the mall.  The mall entrance is the old Nordstrom wing, in the middle of the Pacsun & Forever 21 entrances. The Cheesecake Factory now rolls out their sinfully delectable cheesecakes, along with their varied menu, in a more convenient location for me.  It's nice to have another local eatery to choose from, in the ever expanding Cerritos food scene.  I enjoyed my eggroll sampler & I look forward to exploring the rest of the menu, cheesecake notwithstanding.

However, I read reviews and was a little confused and thought maybe I better avoid, service and long wait time were the common complaint so I decided to hold off because I knew since it was a new restaurant, they must be super busy. So, I recently had a birthday,  although I celebrated with family recently, my son wanted to take me out to dinner and we chose Cheesecake Factory. His only day off is Saturday so we arrived peak hour, 6 pm dinner and as expected, it was jam packed. The line to check in was super long and I can tell people were irritated but I also saw happy people. Our estimated wait time was over an hour no biggie, we walked around the mall a little and people watched outside. There is plenty of tables outside to wait and I noticed the outdoor patio was really nice and I think I saw heaters(it was chilly). We finally got seated just at the right time the hostess said we would. The place is beautiful, elegant and overall vibe was good, we had a nice table too! Our server checked in on us within minutes and was extremely cordial considering having to deal with a large crowd. I believe our drinks and delicious breadsticks were ready within 8 minutes. I had the luau salad, there is no way to describe how amazing and gorgeous this salad was..all I can say is you have to try it if you are into eating healthy. It comes with macadamia nuts, pineapple, chicken and lots of greens, delicious! My son had steak and shrimp which was equally amazing.. Food arrived promptly and was prepared just right, I have no complaints. Will I come back? Yes and I do recommend, there is a wait so if you are impatient, this isn't your kind of place.

Our waiter is very nice and has kept me updated on my late soup, but we have been waiting an hour so far & all we've had are drinks, bread, and the appetizer (which was chicken potstickers and THOSE WERE FAB!)  So after the hour my soup-creamy artichoke chicken-came. I would really recommend it so delicious!!  15 min past the hour (so we have been at the table a total of 1 hour 15) the food arrives. Chicken piccata (creamy lemony chicken and pasta! Good portion size!), shepherd's pie, and a flatbread. It was all hot and tasty.  My mom wanted me to mention that they have no prices on their drink menu so when she got the bill she saw her lemon-drop martini, which she said was tasty, was $12, which stunned her. I equate CF with BJs in food/quality/selection, and BJs drinks are $4 cheaper.  Check came promptly, but i usually have the most trouble getting the waiter to come back and take my money...nope he just took it as i was typing.  Bottom line: dinner took too long BUT this is a new location so maybe it will improve. Ill give it time, but CF has never been my favorite place so i don't know when.

753,Alphonsine B.,"Carson, CA",4,15,5.0,1.0,2016-02-01,"We went yesterday to celebrate our moms birthday and received horrible service. After being greeted by our server we put in an order of drinks that were brought to the table 5 or so minutes later. No problem, that was pretty quick. My brother and I sent back our strawberry lemonades because we didn't like them, they tasted super sour & had no strawberry syrup in them. Our server acted personally offended by this (& never took it off the bill) The rest of the party requested straws as none were brought out with their drinks. 10 minutes went by and nothing. We finally had to ask a different server to bring us some, which that server did promptly. After our drink order was placed our server told us she would bring bread shortly, and couldn't at the moment because it was still baking. 10 minutes later I get up to go to the restroom and notice many tables that were seated after us with bread on their table. She comes back to take our order, still no bread. While placing the order we ask for one entree with most of the toppings on the side, she acted baffled and asked if we even wanted the sides to be brought out at all. Are you going to take money off the bill if we opt out of those sides? No, so bring us what we pay for. Order is placed, food comes out and still no bread! Finally I have to ask her for it & she annoyingly says ""I'll have to check if it's don't baking yet"". This is after I watched another table being brought bread 10 minutes earlier! The worst part of the night was the fact that they completely forgot about the birthday we were celebrating, two tables got an ice cream sundae & were sang to & my mother was never acknowledged. We reminded our server THREE times that we were here to celebrate for her! Instead of even asking if we were ready for desert, we just got brought the check. Finally my mom got tired & left. Then our server comes over & asks if we still want to do the birthday sundae for her. After we tell her our mom got sick of waiting, all she said was ""oh, sorry"" & walks away. We were really disappointed in the service we received last night.

I of course checked yelp first to see how it's been doing, and was surprised to see a two and a half star rating. Many of the reviews are based on poor service and wait times. I was hoping that at least the food would be good. We got lucky because the rest of our party was already there, so we didn't have to wait. We sat right down at our table. One of the people in my party had trouble receiving olives for his martini, while another person never got the appetizer she ordered (although the latter was not really the fault of the server; the dish she tried to order apparently did not exist?). (Skip this paragraph if you don't want to read about kids.) My kids rely on apple juice at restaurants. One of my sons doesn't handle milk very well. We ordered apple juice for the kids (as usual), but the server informed us that apple juice does not come with kids meals. We chose to get milk instead, because we don't want our kids drinking soda. Anyway, after the server left we took a closer look at the kids menu, and apple juice is clearly listed as one of the options. My son had already guzzled a ton of milk, so I was worried that he would throw it up if he also drank apple juice. The server apologized for his mistake and brought out the apple juices in addition to the milk, at no extra charge. In the end, this situation just left a sour taste in my mouth. I still gave three stars instead of two because the food was actually quite good. The strawberry lemonade was refreshing and excellent. The egg roll sampler was quite delicious. They were crispy and tasty. The calamari was fresh, crisp, and delectable. My steak Diane and shrimp scampi combo was good. The sauce that came with the steak was flavorful, and complimented the steak well. I requested medium rare but received medium, but I ate it anyway. The shrimp were seasoned right and not too heavy. The mashed potatoes and veggies were good as well. The vanilla bean cheesecake was rich, indulgent, potent, and packed with vanilla flavor. After dining here, the two and a half star rating totally makes sense to me. Many people are being rubbed the wrong way by poor service. I can't speak from experience about the wait times, as I did not have to wait, but I have heard many yelpers complain about the lack of a reservation system.

The prices for the food is crazy.

Since two of us were vegetarian, they didn't have much veggie choices(pizza wise) except the cheese pizza so we asked if we can get The Everything Pizza, but make 1/2 of the pizza w/o meat. We waited 30 minutes, eating 2 rounds of free bread only to find that the pizza we asked for was not made to our instructions. The server said that the chef must have been confused. So to make it easier in the chefs mind, the server asked if they can make it all no meat instead of making 1/2 of no meat and we agreed. We finally got another pizza an extra 30 minutes later, and ended up getting the first pizza for free as an apology, which was nice for my 1 friend.

I noticed her busing her own tables, which surprised me since she took our order, brought our drinks, and checked on our table consistently.

This cocktail has a refreshing blend of sweet, tropical flavors. The sweet and tangy passion fruit balances well with the caramel flavor and spicy notes of the rum. Rating: 4.5/5 Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip is spinach, artichoke hearts, shallots, garlic, and a mixture of cheeses served bubbly hot with tortilla chips and salsa. This dip is gooey, creamy, cheesy deliciousness. The spinach adds a touch of greenness while the artichoke adds some sweetness. The addition of chopped tomatoes and sour cream add layer of multi-textural bites. Rating: 4.5/5 Pit Beef Dip is a Baltimore classic with char-roasted beef, melted fontina cheese, caramelized onions, au jus, and horseradish sauce on a grilled bun. This sandwich is reminiscent of a French dip. The beef is tender and juicy. The layer of creamy fontina cheese puts this sandwich out of the park. The sandwich just needs a sturdier bun to hold up to all of the beef juices so it doesn't get soggy. Rating: 4.5/5 Lemon-Herb Roasted Chicken is fresh, all natural half chicken served with mashed potatoes, carrots, watercress, and topped with a light lemon garlic-herb sauce. The chicken is golden brown on the outside and tender on the inside. The herb flavors bring the chicken flavor forward. Easing back on the lemon would make the chicken just perfect. The carrots are perfectly cooked and sweet. Mashed potatoes are creamy, yet still have some chunks so you know they are made in house. Rating: 4.5/5 Oreo® Dream Extreme Cheesecake is creamy cheesecake layered with Oreo cookies, topped with Oreo cookie mousse, and chocolate icing. It is not nearly as sweet as you would imagine.

Then the sandwich which may have had an ounce of turkey on it was served on what looked like a stale hot dog bun which was rather hard. I ate the sandwich without the bun because it was so unpleasant. The soup was delivered without a soup spoon so we had to ask for spoons from two different servers. Meanwhile the soup got cold waiting on the spoons. First the waitress said no one knew where the spoons were, then she brought us teaspoons which didn't work too well. She said soup spoons were being washed and she would bring them ASAP. Then she finally came back with great big serving spoons saying they were better than nothing. It was ridiculous. I have ordered this lunch special at the Brea restaurant and it is presented wonderfully and with all the appropriate utensils.  I have been very disappointed during both visits.

207,Jennifer T.,"Las Vegas, NV",593,553,729.0,2.0,2016-03-12,"I know this Cheesecake Factory is new so the servers here probably haven't had enough training or experience but it seems like management needs to 1) tell the host to slow down on seating servers when they're super busy 2) get more servers on the floor 3) give servers less tables.  I came here at 6:40 on a Saturday night with 3 other people and was quoted an hour to an hour and 30 min. Not a problem, they told us they were out of buzzers so we had to come back in 20 min to get one. We walked around the mall (not too far) until our buzzer rang.  We got seated In a booth in the very very far back. 5 minutes go by and no server comes by, finally she arrives and asks us for our drink orders. Another 5 minutes go by and we finally get our drinks, a strawberry lemonade, an IPA and two waters. Another 10 minutes go by before we get any bread and are able to order food. After we get our bread, our server comes by to tell us she will be leaving and a new server would be taking care of us. So, I cut her some slack thinking she probably worked a double shift and was super tired which explains why she was so slow in getting our orders and drinks. But, throughout the entire night I see her walking past our table... Not sure what that's all about. Our new server seemed to be a bit better than she was. However, his attention to detail was lacking. He did not notice our stacked plates on the edge of the table and empty water and lemonade glasses. At least he was nice and gave us recommendations on dessert.  We ordered the... 5/5: Thai lettuce wraps. I think it was around $13.50. THE BEST LETTUCE WRAPS EVER. Seriously. It comes with carrots, pickled cucumber, some noodles, slices of grilled chicken breast, bean sprouts, 3 dipping sauces and lettuce. Our grilled chicken was a little bit burnt but we were too hungry to care.  1/5: crab and artichoke dip. I think it was $11.49. We asked for half tortillas and half bread if possible or a side of tortillas. It came with a side of tortillas and we were charged 2.50 without being warned about the charge before hand. The toasted bread it came with was EXTRA toasty to the point of almost being burnt... So it was not good with the toast. If you order this, skip the bread and sub tortillas chips!!! The dip itself was just ok, nothing special... I would have preferred the spinach dip instead.  4/5: chicken madiera and steak Diane combo ($21.50). It came with mushrooms and mashed potatoes. The chicken had two asparagus on it for decoration. It's a small portion but since we got a big appetizer, it was enough for two people. The chicken was super soft and steak was flavorful but kind of chewy. They only gave us 3 steak cubes.  BF had the gumbo and said it was pretty good. He ended up taking half of it home.  Sister ordered a side of Mac and cheese (6.50) and it was creamy, cheesy and delicious. Noodles were perfect, not too soft or hard.  Sisters BF ordered the fish tacos which came with 4, some rice and a side of black beans. He was only able to finish 2 and got the rest to go.  4/5 white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake I think. I wasn't a big fan of the white chocolate chips in the creamy cheesecake and didn't get too much macadamia nut but the cheesecake is really good!!  Total bill was $133",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=200,2.44,2.47,2.412,1.9280000000000002,2.458

A full 5 minutes later my chicken was served. Ok. But the burger took 15 more minutes, then came out without fries of cheese. Really? The most basic thing we ordered seemed too difficult for them to handle.  Don't get me wrong, I've been to many cheesecake factories and have always enjoyed good service.  The manager Gabriel came out and although he started out apologetic, then blamed my fried for ordering his burger well done and promised another one would be brought out ""to-go"" as we requested. Another 15 minutes pass as we wait for the burger and fries.  Now here is where it gets topped off. Gabriel brings out a bag and hands it to my wife very apologetic like. Both me and my buddy think she was given a consolation cheesecake or something like that cause it was her birthday. I ask what it was and she said, it's the burger and fries. WTF? Really.

We have wait months for the hype to go down and visit the restaurant without waiting an hour to sit down. When we got there; the hostess told us to wait 10 minutes to be seated. Two minutes later a group of 6 came and they got seated it right away. We told the hostess how come they got seated right away and we didn't it. Anyways she apologize and we got seated. Once seated the waiter took awhile to show up. She showed up and we already had decided our entrees. One thing I don't like at all is that the menu does not invite you to try the food. It's all letters and not provocative. Anyhow, I chose the tostada chicken breast salad and my mom ordered the Cuban sandwich. I received my entree way too early and my mom received hers 10 minutes later. When I saw my tostada salad it was a complete disappointment. It was barely any chicken on it. It seemed that they put a lot of lettuce and tomatoes to make it look big but in reality it has not even 1 chicken breast on it. I thought that for 10.50 it was expensive and the flavor was nothin out of this world. Personally chilis has a better tostada salad for 8.95 that contains more chicken. Finally, my Mom sandwich was alright. It didn't taste anything different and it was pricey as well. I always want it To come to this restaurant because It seems busy and I thought the food was delicious but personally is not only the food that are bad; is also the service.

Cheesecake Factory, is one of my favorite restaurants and have always experience top notch service while visiting the one at the The grove, Marina Del Rey, Americana on brand and even Cheesecake Factory in Las Vegas. I expected the one in Cerritos to be the same and twice as better just because it's new. However, this time around i walked out so unhappy and unsatified with how poor the service was and how the manager handled the situation.  We checked in at around 7:35pm, host said the waiting time was an 1hr, which was totally fine. We did not wait an hour, instead we got seated much quicker and waited for 25 minutes.  Host sat us down at our table and the first thing i notice was that there was only one small plate, one napkin and one set of utensils. I went ahead and told the host and she said she would bring some. The host never came back, so we waited 8 minutes until our waiter came by. After we order our drinks and appetizer, i addressed if she could bring plates and utensils and  napkins. Appetizers came out and we still did not have utensils, plates, napkins and bread.   Waiter, brought another waiter and said she was going on her break and he would take care of us. We were ready to order our food and once again i asked if he could bring us plates, utensils and napkins for the THIRD TIME! We received our food and we STILL did not have  plates, napkins and utensils. At this point, our food was cold and we were waiting for our waiter to come by. I'm sure he was busy, so i went ahead and asked another waiter for the FIFTH TIME , if he could bring plates, utensils, and napkins, he said said sure. However, he never came back. I decided to address my issue to the manager, i explained the situaion and all he said was, ""I'm sorry, let me get plates and utensils"". He bought out the utensils, but forgot to bring small plates. I told him, ""are we suppose to eat our food with our hands"", and he said, ""well, we can have a food eating contest"". At this point i was really upset and It really grind my gear on how unprofessional he was whether he was joking around. In all honesty i expected him to say,"" i apologize for this situation, this will be on us"", just for courtesy, but all he said was, ""i'm sorry"". I don't expect my food to be free, but when a situation like this happens and i have to ask 5 TIMES for something that should have been on the table BEFORE we got seated, i would expect that manager to be like"" this will be a complimentary dinner"", or something in between those lines.

I went to the restaurant on Friday March 18 to order a cheesecake to be picked up Saturday after we ate lunch. I ordered a large cheesecake - 1/2 banana cream and 1/2 lemon meringue.  The employee asked me if I would like to add a chocolate plaque they could put Happy Birthday on, I ordered a dark chocolate one for $3 and change - I don't remember the exact amount. I told the girl we were coming in to eat lunch around 1:30 and I would pick up the cheesecake after we ate. After eating I went to the counter to pick up the cheesecake - I watched the girl pick up the box, it was sitting out on the counter. I asked about that - why it wasn't in the fridge? She assured me it was fine. Then she brought out the chocolate plaque - a WHITE chocolate plaque with Happy Birthday on it. I told her I ordered DARK chocolate plaque and showed her the receipt. She just looked at me - I knew she was waiting for me to say ""oh that's okay."" But it wasn't okay - no one likes white chocolate. But my teenage grandson who was behind me said just take it so we can go. No apology - no we'll refund your $3 and change. I am 10 minutes from this restaurant - when I opened the cheesecake box at home the meringue was completely melted off of the cheesecake - it had melted down the side and was in a glob on the cardboard. This is why they shouldn't have taken it out of the fridge before we picked it up.  The White chocolate plaque - it went in the trash after the party, seems no one likes white chocolate - which isn't really chocolate at all, but that's another story.

Anyways we ordered some spaghetti and linguini I ordered the cajun shrimp my husband when original. We were sat next to what I assumed was the dishwasher because there was a bit of noise directly behind the wall we were sitting next to. I can see that being one of the downfalls if you are trying to get romantic I think the outside would be the way to go next to the fire, It is so pretty out there. Inside it can get noisy considering it is a busy place, so again if you want something a bit quieter try the outside. Our food came out faster then our wait. For a party of 2 we waited about 30 minutes so not to bad. I did see a couple bigger parties getting upset because the wait was longer but I mean come on if you are traveling with like 10 people its going to take a while. I mean, has anyone ever heard of reservations? Try it out. I really enjoyed my linguini the shrimp was my favorite part that cajun spice made the entire meal perfect, it was so much food to that I had enough to take home for my lunch the next day and let my tell you it does taste just as good the next day when you microwave it. We had a nice dinner, our server was new but he did a good job as serving us and the big party across from us equally my drink was never empty and all plates were taken right away. In the end we ordered a cheesecake to share. It was a huge piece but so amazing I would have ordered my own. The whipcream at this place is like a whole nother world it is amazing! We now make a point to frequent this location whenever we want cheesecake. I have recently tried the red velvet cheesecake and it is amazing!

My husband and I checked in and was told with was a two hour wait sooooo we left. On a second occasion we decided to play it smart and went for lunch during the week so no wait. My husband wanted to get the Caroline, which is a pulled pork and Cole slaw burger type sandwich but was told they didn't have that????? I mean then what's the point of the menu. Anyway the waiter suggested he get a bbq  pulled chicken sandwich, and he agreed. I ordered the steak Diane and chicken.  So, then the plates arrive late and at different times. I got mine first so I waited for my husbands plate. I didn't want to be rude and eat without him. When his plate arrived it wasn't what we ordered. It was a buffalo chicken sandwich and it was not pulled. We called for the waiter and told him about the mistake. What they did to fix it???? They brought us a side of bbq. It was so infuriating that we laughed and ate. So never again with this location.

Then, we were having some minutes for looking up what we order. These are what we ordered.. Avocado Eggrolls, Lunch special Spicy Chicken Chipotle pasta, Factory burger for meal, and Margarita & Blood Orange Mojito for Drinks. For mealtime, we were there for an hour. I forgot name of the server who charged our area, he was nice and hospitable. The most important thing is taste. Avocado Eggrolls for appetizer came with Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion and Cilantro Fried in a Crisp Wrapper. Served with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce. If one who does not like the taste of cilantro, take it out and also the sause has in it. I and my wife satisfied with the dishes except the Factory burger because they use baguette for the bun so that it was little hard to have a bite. I'd personally love chipotle style, so I usually have had the type of food. The pasta I had was pretty good. We got penny noodle for the pasta, but you can change another pasta shape noodles  as you are odering. Ah! they heated the pasta dish in order to keep it warm while you are eating.

Yes, 2.5 hour visit because we decided to see if our server would ever make any initiative to strike a conversation with us or to see if HE would ask US if we wanted to order any other items besides our 2 entrees. Also, at some point in the night, he actually sat down in the booth directly behind us with two other employees, talking. This place is legitimately wild.  He first came to our table and just asked us what we wanted to order. He didn't push any appetizers or desserts on us, and did not introduce himself for that matter. We think his name was ""James"" since we overheard a busser calling him over. He never spoke to us after asking us what we wanted to order and what drinks we wanted. He dropped off our drinks with NO words, only a ""you're welcome"". Someone else dropped off our food and we saw him checking up on ALL the tables around us, EXCEPT for us. It was such a strange and bizarre experience and I'm assuming he's new. I just don't understand with all the terrible reviews that there is no accountability for the workers or the management.

The cheese was good but the marina sauce would have tasted better if it was hot.. It was more on the cold side, not even lukewarm.  Buffalo fritters?: chunks of chicken fried inside a buffalo sauce batter. It was more batter than chicken to be honest. Wouldn't order it again. Too greasy Flatbread: tomato one. It's on the healthier side of flatbread. If you love tomatoes, this ones for you. I got the chicken Parmesan with tomato pasta.

Best thing: loaded baled potato soup which tasted like a bacon n potato bisque. The creamy baked potato  OMG so bomb.  The patio is huge and goregous. Nice space for a private party.

692,Mary Beth P.,"Buena Park, CA",250,35,64.0,2.0,2016-06-07,"This review is based on the service only. The food at Cheesecake Factory is always consistent. I'm more biased when it comes to service because I'm in the industry, and it's just the little things that count. When you go out to eat, you're spending money on the experience as well as the food. We were served by Aisha, overall a okay server. She didn't really try to make small talk or anything. She was more like a, ""What do you want, here's your food type of server"". No personality, no enthusiasm, just hi and bye kind of server. I was actually there to celebrate my anniversary with my bf so it was a special occasion evening. Ordered the calamari and asked specifically for marinara because it's served with cocktail sauce and a peppercorn ranch type sauce. No marinara, still had to ask for it. When she placed the knife for my bf's meal, she didn't even use a marking tray, and put the knife upside down (I wasn't kidding when I said I'm in the industry!) When it came to main entrees, our entrees didn't even come out at the same time .. my bf received his entree first, so he had to wait until we (our daughter and myself) received ours. Afterwards, when we were obviously done eating, Aisha offered dessert, which we ordered to go, and said she would be back to box up our food. A few moments later, a runner dropped off a few boxes and some plastic bags for us to go .. I know it sounds lame but I do expect more quality service when you're spending  $18 and per plate. Even servers at Olive Garden are professional enough to personally box up food for guests. When you have a team of runners and expos, and your only job is to take care of your tables .. Don't be lazy. Pretty kindergarten service for such a nice restaurant. Will definitely be back but only for the food and cheesecake!

If you've never been to a Cheesecake Factory before, know that the portions are enormous and the menu is LOOOOOOOOOOONG, which explains why you're not going to get the ""best"" tasting fettuccine Alfredo you've ever had; they're about volume here and you're paying for selection and portion size. Let's just say you won't be a regular unless you are a social eater/drinker and like to spend money on early 2000's ""fine dining"" experiences.

I had lunch with my good friend from work on a beautiful sunny California day and was treated with a cloudiness of rudeness and neglect. We walked in and asked for a patio seat, got seated. Waited for 15 minutes and then got up to order with the bartender who was courteous given the situation we were in. Once the bartender told the waiter, she said nobody had her section as if to believe nobody was waiting on patio tables even though the two tables next to us were being served with 5 star service. Seeing someone next to you getting served exceptionally and you being ignored really takes you for a toll. Why should anyone go into an establishment like cheesecake factory and except to be treated like a ghost or unwelcome? That is uncalled for and unprofessional. When we asked for our check after everyone around us had been served extra bread and even offered dessert, I flagged down the waitress and asked for the check without dessert offered and asked for the manager. Once the manager arrived we vented about the horrible service and told her about the monstrosity that just occurred. She said she ""apologized"" and will ""take the feedback into consideration"". Not surprisingly, we weren't even given a single gesture of apologies. Please do NOT go here I would give them a .1 star if I could. Service is HORRIBLE. Never again. The food was passable which is why I gave them one star.

No wait to be seated, which was fantastic as we had tickets for a movie at 5:15.  Restaurant was not  full, so we thought, great we will be in and out with no problems. Unfortunately, that would be the last of the expeditious service and attention.  We waited about 10 minutes for our order to be taken. The waitress came by once to let us know our food would be out soon. Soon was a 25 minute wait. Food finally arrived, looked amazing and it was. Unfortunately our service was not. We saw our waitress one other time after our food was delivered. She brought me a refill on my drink, but nothing for my friend who was drinking the exact same thing. She kept saying the pitcher was empty and she couldn't find another one, which made no sense. At that point we were just trying to finish up and get out in time for the movie.  We rushed through our meal with a 12 minute window to catch our movie. That's were we were wrong. Couldn't find our waitress to get the bill. It took a couple of mnutes to flag down anyone to get our waitress. I stopped a young man who was cleaning tables and asked  him if he could get our waitress, he nodded yes, then took a few steps and stopped to check his cell phone and then just looked around, to appease me. The only way I got my bill was by a waitress accidentally delivering a slice of cheesecake to my table, which was how another waitress came over to let her know it was the wrong table . This waitress was very nice and immediately helped me with getting my bill. She stayed so I could wrap up the bill and then out of no where our original waitress showed up. Gave her the bill, paid in cash and when she returned, I counted my change back and guess what it was short and she was no where to be found.  Since we were going to be late to the movie, I was not about to wait for her return, so the  amount she shorted me was added into her tip.  I love the food here, unfortunately, the service at this location needs a lot of work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=780,3.04,2.82,2.552,2.6640000000000006,2.9080000000000004

The first time we ate there it was the week of the opening and had a very bad experience with the speed of the servers and time for the food to get out. We figured it was the first week and that they would work out the problems. The second time we gave once again the server had an attitude of some kind, it wasn't until we had to ask for the manager that we were able to have a nice server who took care of us, the food still took awhile but it was great. Today we figured we would go in at 11:00 so it would not take as long to get our food or have a better chance of having better service, WRONG!!! We were seated within 5 minutes, but it took the server 10 minutes to get us a chocolate milk and my oj. Really 10 minutes to have drinks? The server never apologized for the time it took. We once again asked for the manager who was really nice and apologized. We had a new server, but it still took 20 minutes to get our food out (after the manager told us he would ""rush"" our order).

And the problem I have with that is that Cheesecake Factory is a pricey restaurant.   If I'm gonna pay good money I expect high quality food, service, and atmosphere.  My husband said the bathrooms were dirty.  As we left we noticed smudges on the glass, disarray counters, and dirty dirty floors.  As we were leaving the hostess gave us a half hearted thanks for coming in.  As she said this she looked away.  Los Cerritos Center missed the mark with this one.  I don't normally review on Cheesecake factories, but this was so far from the normal standard I had to comment.  My Cheesecake Factory experiences range from KCMO the Plaza, Redondo Beach, Marina Del Rey, The Grove, Newport Fashion Island and Summerlin near Las Vegas.  I had high hopes, but I won't be coming back unless there is a turn around.  I've had better experiences at CPK, and BJ'S here in Cerritos so I will stick to those places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=760,2.72,2.88,2.58,2.436,2.8160000000000003

The wait isn't too bad depending on what time you come. The parking can be bad however.  Considering this is a mall and there is a new movie theater right next door, this doesn't really come as a surprise.   Inside, it is pretty small, but nicely laid out.  There's a cool patio area outside and inside the mall for those interested.   For the food. You must consider starting off with the Thai Lettuce Wraps for $13.  It is really worth it, at least to us.  The marinated chicken, cilantro, carrot slices, sliced cucumber, noodles, and the three awesome sauces.. you cannot go much wrong here.   For the main dish, we split the shrimp and steak combo.. It is slightly small, but perfect for sharing if you ask me (considering the wraps and then dessert afterwards). Last but not least, the Hershey's Smore Cheesecake was fabulous.  I've tried the red velvet there too and both are amazing.   The only bad  part was the service..

Nothing against the first server but you could tell off the bat that Shannon's personality was a lot friendlier. She was very attentive and had such amazing energy. You could tell right away from watching her that she enjoys what she does. Our food was amazing also! My boyfriend had the cheese steak sandwich and I tried the chicken 4 cheese pasta. ALL was cooked to PERFECTION!!! The bread was not soggy do to the juiciness of the meat, which is always a plus!

But it was worth the wait. The service was exemplary. Jessica W. checked on us regularly without being obtrusive. She brought me ice water when I couldn't decide on a drink. She brought my sumptuous dish of clam chowder before the entree. I detest when soup is delivered with the meal. (They only prepare one soup per day. I really wanted tomato bisque, but Friday is clam chowder day and it was really good.) She delivered our take-home cheesecake bag just as we were completing the check transaction. We never had to wait for her or track her down. The restaurant was  getting pretty busy by the end of our meal, but Jessica kept her eye on us.  Just as I finished the chowder our entrees arrived. Hubs chose Shrimp Scampi. Delectable jumbo shrimp dusted with panko, then lightly fried flanked the plate of creamy sauce of butter, heavy cream and diced tomato. The prawns looked juicy and plump. On the far side of his plate, a nest of noodles crowned a handful of sautéed spinach leaves. This has become his favorite dish from TCF. I selected a lunch special of Grilled Salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli tips. Very simple. Beautifully cooked. Asked for a bit of ranch dressing on the side to dress up the broccoli. Really enhanced the flavor of the steamed veggie. While we ate a waiter passed, headed for another table, with two plates of Southern Fried Chicken. Looked delicious. On the way out I talked with the ladies who ordered the ""highly recommended"" chicken.  They reported that they specifically come to TCF just for the chicken. I'll try that next time. Hubs never met a slice of cheesecake he didn't like. This time he took home a slice of Strawberry Cheesecake, which he inhaled almost as soon as we got home. A delightful meal.

So that didn't go too well on our part.  I do think that even though this place seems very crowded with staff....it seems like they are under staff?  If that makes any sense?  This was the second time that my family has been here and both times the food just takes way to long to come to our table.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=540,3.36,3.14,2.716,2.316,3.2280000000000006

It took me a while to find a parking spot shared by other establishments at Cerritos Mall. When I got there, two of my friends mentioned the crappy attitude our waitress was giving them, especially towards the birthday girl. The only reason I could think of for such attitude was because we were a party of 10, most of us arrived late. It was very difficult to find parking here. I had to idle my car, while waiting and hoping someone would walk towards their car from the mall near me.  Service seemed slow in the beginning. After our food arrived, we all took pictures of our dishes. We noticed a complete change in service afterwards. The waitress and staff members were more attentive to our needs. They came around often to check up on us, refilled our drinks, took our dessert order, brought the birthday girl her treat and sang the happy birthday song with us.  We ordered a few appetizers (avocado egg rolls, battered fried shrimps, spring rolls), a couple of superfood salads, several pasta dishes (jambalaya, chicken/mushroom, herb-crusted chicken), salmon, pork chop, and Cuban sandwich. Of course, we ordered an assortment of sliced cheesecakes. We didn't have any complaints with what we ordered. In fact, I enjoyed my salad here, I made a trip to their Redondo Beach location couple weeks later.  If you ever decide to come out to this location, remember to bust out your phone or camera and take those foodie pics for great service! Good luck in finding parking!

We arrived around 5:55pm and was told we would have a our a 30 minute wait. Looking around at the crowd I thought that was never going to happen. The Cheesecake Factory sits right next to the new Harkins movie theater, so it is a very popular place to eat. At the thirty minute mark I made my way in to ask how much longer it would be, I made it to the desk just as my buzzer went off, so I went out and retrieved the rest of our party. We had only been seated for about 30 seconds, when our server, David, asked us for our drink choices. Two black iced teas and one water. Hard to mess up, but the teas came out sweetened. When he came back to get our order I told him he could have the tea back, because it didn't taste  like black to me. He apologized and asked if he could try again. (He admitted he might have poured the tropical instead of black). The next tea out was black, freshly brewed, strong and just as I like it! I ordered the Almond Crusted Super Green Salad, Mom ordered the Super Green Antioxidant salad with grilled chicken added, and my boyfriend ordered the tomato basil salad w/chicken. Our wait for food was about 20 minutes, but considering how busy the place is, it wasn't a bad wait at all. David came by several times to add water and tea to our glasses, never letting any of our drinks get low. Our food came out just right. My salmon was cooked to perfection, which is hard to do with such a small (4-6oz) piece. The salad underneath was cold and very good. Mom's chicken was warm and juicy, atop a salad she said was very good. My boyfriend's pasta & chicken were cooked just right. A little too salty for him, but he is very sensitive to salt, so I'm not going to bring down my star rating. It was mom's 71st birthday so they brought out a small ice cream Sunday and sang to her. We ordered a Pumpkin Pie Cheesecake, an Original for the table and one to go. I shouldn't have ordered the one to go, because we did bring home half of each piece. The pumpkin cheesecake tasted just like a pumpkin chiffon pie, and the sour cream topping on the original added a layer of goodness!  Forget the negative reviews you'll read here. It's a busy place, because it's a popular place. If you want to get in and get out, go somewhere else. Their staff was all friendly, attentive and the food was great. Actually, the food was much better than I expected, as it is a chain restaurant and sometimes the quality isn't as high as local hot spots.

He apologized because he forgot to put it in. Then we get our entrees and while they looked very good there were no Forks in sight. I had to wave down a busser and ask for a fork, when I did he gave me the entire silverware platter to pick out whatever I needed. Is this standard service? We waited a few minutes for the appetizer to come out, I noticed our server was just joking around with 4 other coworkers and was completely oblivious to us trying to get his attention. Once he comes over I ask about the fried macaroni balls and he walks away right away and comes back a minute later and says ""they forgot to put the order in for you"". Umm.. whose ""they"" he was the server that was supposed to put it in correct. He tells us that we'll get it for free if we still want it or he can cancel the order. I personally didn't care if they were free or not, my fiance was craving them so I wanted her to have them. Finally they come out 10 minutes later and of course they are burnt and not edible. I didn't want to complain because at that point the dinner seemed like a lost cause. So I go back to eating my spicy cashew chicken and in the middle of me putting a fork full of food in my mouth our server DEVAN comes over and asks me if he can box the food for me. I give him a look like ""dude are you serious?"" He notices my look and says ""if your still working on it its fine"". I just handed him the plate n asked for the check. He asked to box the macaroni balls and I told him they ""no its ok they were burnt"", he made a sigh placed down the check book and that was that. I will never come back to this location. With as many employees on staff as I saw and as few guests that I saw there is no excuse to not be delivering exceptional service. Management at this establishment is terrible as well, should have came to our table to apologize for the inconvenience instead of allowing the kid DEVAN to continuously deliver terrible service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=600,2.4,2.91,2.684,2.34,2.7060000000000004
491,Charmie P.,"South Gate, CA",0,51,,1.0,2016-10-12,"Service: Inconsistent 1* Food:     Inconsistent 1* After 4 tries not once has there been a consistent service or meal.  Whatever is going on with the management in this location, would put less popular places out of business overnight. They survive by their name. Nearly every time I go for lunch, I order the Renee Special.  The 3 times I've attempted to order it at this location, they have gotten in wrong, each and every time.  It's quite a simple order, yet, somehow, they bring it to the table completely wrong.  One thing that the cooks don't dress the soups (tortilla soup w/o the tortillas or crema), use the wrong bread/baguette (they don't seem to be able to identify the differences between bread and baguettes let along brioche and sourdough), used the wrong filling for the sandwich (there's only two choices, how hard is this?), send an extremely wet salad w/o dressing, but, the server doesn't even notice?  One time, ok... 3 times delivering what I didn't order is simply poor management all the way around. Evidently, training on the job is not working out well.   The other 2 times the same exact meal was ordered, it had to go back at least once.  And, all things the servers should have caught before they brought the meal to the table. When serving, you check the order with the actual meals you are picking up. Evidently, this is not done at this location, with consistency.   Not one server even noticed what they were bringing.  I know it's a part time job, but, that's no excuse as tips here are excellent.   Then, when desserts served after clearing the table, the waitress never brought spoors, asked us if we wanted refills on water or other drinks nor asked if we wanted coffee.  Just as odd, she would walk up to the table and start to speak interrupting w/o even waiting to be acknowledged. Trying to get her attention was useless, so someone at another table gave us a fork they weren't using. These sorts of things happened with more than one server over the last 4 times. On one visit, a friend had ask for a medium steak and it was pretty much raw. It was sent back 3 times after which the rest of her meal was cold.  We were with 8 other people and 2 of those we were with did not get their meals until after everyone else had finished.  The waitress forgot to pick up their salads which were limp by the time they arrived.  The management did zip to accommodate or adjust.  When they asked to see the manager, he strolled over and very smugly said he was sorry, however, they were quite busy.  Not exactly accommodating.  Each visit has been with different groups of people (2-10) for lunch and each time the manager on duty was inundated with customer complaints.  Only the one time did someone ask for the manager who simply apologized and made no effort to right the situation.    This is not to say that some didn't get a great meal, but, when it's this disjointed, who cares?  These completely unnecessary flubs made for such uncomfortable dining experiences, some won't be back to this location, not after 4 tries, anyway.  Back to Bella Terra or Fashion Island, but skipping Cerritos.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=480,2.36,2.9,2.684,2.372,2.684

728,Monique C.,"Long Beach, CA",0,7,,1.0,2016-10-30,"If I could give this location a 0 I would. The Cheesecake Factory has been my favorite for years until today. And because I am a creature of habit I've always order the same thing, the garlic noodles with chicken and shrimp and the chicken littles. Today I ordered to because it was raining and my 6 year old daughter was tired. I come to the Cheesecake Factory at least 4x a month. Lashaundri greeted me when I cam to pick up my order and took care of my card transaction. She was pleasant and nice. When I got home the garlic noodles with chicken/shrimp I ordered was a mess. This chicken was pieces of a thigh and leg cut up with bones and skin, rubbery and just an all out mess. I have been ordering this dish for years and NEVER HAVE I EVER HAD THAT TYPE OF CHICKEN IN MY GARLIC PASTA. It usually is chicken breast cut in small pieces. Not today. I called and talked to Lashaundri and she transferred me to the Manager Mark who then told me to come back and he would take care of me. I do not live close to the location so going back was an inconvenience but I did. When I got there Mark says the chicken is always made like that and it specifically says it on the menu that the chicken has bone in it. He then asked where is the shrimp, that he doesn't see it. I then put my fingers in the noodles to show him all of the shrimp. And then he says oh. He completely was insulting my intelligence and embarrassing me in from of customers. I laughed because I Know it's not. I asked he to show me and he said he couldn't find it while looking at the menu. I then asked could I see the menu to show him that it does not. And when I pointed it out to show him he was incorrect he says that the recipe is new , really? I told him I have been ordering the same thing and coming to the Cheesecake Factory for years and never have I ever had bones in my garlic noodle when ordered with chicken and shrimp. He then proceeds to say I will take care of you if you want something else. I ordered the shrimp scampi and then he say great we'll get that right out and was about to walk away. When I told him that the scampi was less than the noodles and I would need my change. He was like let me get you Cheesecake. I said no. And he said let me go put a rush on your order. By this time I'm upset because he was extremely rude and insulting. I asked to speak to him so that I could just get a refund. When he came back he said we don't do refunds only gift cards. I'm trying to take care of you, huh yeah I don't think so. I said please just put my refund back on my card. He said okay you can leave I'll put it back but you can go. Excuse me. Not a kid and don't appreciate how I was told to or how he tried to just put me out and without a refund receipt saying that my card would be reimbursed. I told him I would not leave until that happened and I would NEVER be back there. If that is how your managers treat regular customers that is just said. And trying to lie and argue a customer down about their food in from of other customers was the worst. I HAVE NEVER BEEN TREATED LIKE THAT IN MY LIFE!!!!! I will be sure to make somewhere else a favorite because the way he talked to me and treated me was disgusting and disrespectful. MARK DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE A MANAGER.

497,S P.,"Buena Park, CA",0,11,,1.0,2016-11-11,"We had the worst service! I've been looking through the reviews and responses from Cheesecake on Yelp. Cheesecake responds by trying to appease customers by saying, ""give us another chance, we will talk to our team members  so it doesn't happen again""...obviously it did and its continuing to happen... There should be an improvement in service if you're asking your customers to ""give another chance."" When the restaurant is rated at 2.5 stars, shouldn't there be a red flag alert saying we need to do something to change these reviews? In no way was today's service anything but horrible. To top it off, one of Cheesecake's review said, ""you should have spoken to a manager."" The problem was the manager.  I've given Cheesecake a lot of our business as well as big family gatherings. I am in such utter disappointment ...almost disgusted that a small monetary expense to make a couple more bucks would take over principality and consumer satisfaction. I've been to many different Cheesecake locations... It has always been a pleasant experience where truly I felt customer satisfaction was at the top priority...well except this Cerritos location. By far the worst.  As a new location wouldn't you want to be exceptional in every way...there are so many competitors out there near this location. Really? It boggles my mind. I completely agree with the overall rating at 2.5 stars maybe less bc I would never want to go back there again. That should tell you guys that your management team is not doing such a good job training your employees and doing what you can to bring customer satisfaction. I heard that cheesecake's motto is customer satisfaction but Holly, the manager ruined that motto over requesting for extra sauce.  She clearly saw that i didn't really touch my food bc the jambalaya pasta tasted so bland with little sauce to cover the noodles...although I requested for extra sauce from the get go. It tasted more bland bc there was so much noodles...it tasted overcooked! The cook probably doesn't know ratios to proportions. When I ordered I already requested for extra sauce but it came out with barely any. My pasta was lacking the rich savory flavors from the pasta. So we requested for extra sauce. It took nearly 35 minutes-40 minutes getting the sauce. When the sauce came out after waiting so long, literally there was so many tomato chunks and no sauce to marinade the pasta noodles so we requested for more. This is when our server comes back saying they were going to charge us for more sauce...granted i was already dissatisfied with the pasta dish. Jambalaya is one of my favorite dishes at Cheesecake... whoever made it, destroyed it and the manager just killed it.  I wasn't even asking for a complimentary meal bc it didn't taste good, I was asking for more sauce so I can fix the meal for its full flavor that I remember having...but holly the manager adamantly said she would need to charge extra. We had ordered over $100.00 worth of food for a table of two adults and 2 young children less than 4 years old who don't eat much but we ordered their own kid's meal. Not to mention, we were ready to order dessert bc our girls saved room for it while I was still waiting but we didn't want to spend another penny there. The amount spent did not equate to dissatisfying customers for extra sauce... Especially for a pasta dish that didn't taste up to par. Overcooked noodles made it worse bc there was barely enough sauce. I call this Poor decision making skills!!! I would never hire someone like that, the cook who probably complained that he or she had to make more sauce and the manager who didn't know how to listen to the customer's concern.

Anyway, waited about 15-20 min to get seated, that's a fair time to wait. We ordered the loaded potato tots as our appetizer and those are bomb af. Anyway, after we finished we ordered our entrees. I ordered the grilled porkchop and my BF ordered the steak diane. About 2 min later, another server comes to our table with 2 plates (a steak Diane and a chicken entree). We let him know that wasn't what ordered..so about 1 min later he comes back with another server and she asks me ""I could have sworn you ordered the chicken.."" I was like ummm NO, I ordered the pork. So they still drop off the steak diane to my BF cause it was the same dish. Anyway, ANOTHER min later, our actual server comes by and apologizes for the confusion but still takes the entree away and I understand there is confusion because the prior table that was sitting there walked out. So we are waiting, and we finally got our entrees. My porkchop entree was mediocre, I still ate half of it. The applesauce was a little strange being that it had some citrus fruit in it but it was OK, still edible. The steak diane is decent as well. I still had half of my porkchop left and my BF had a couple of steak pieces left with a ton of mashed potatoes left. I stopped eating because I wanted to make room for cheesecake. We were in conversation at the time our server came and grabbed our unfinished entrees. I assumed he was going to box them and give them back to us so he then asks us if we want dessert. I order the red velvet cheesecake and BF orders the godiva cheesecake. Our server then brought our cheesecake plus the check. Mine was excellent. Anyway, still can't finish the cheesecake cause the slice was massive so I get the servers attention and MAKE SURE TO ASK FOR BOXES... So he obliges and give us boxes for our cheesecakes... BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR UNFINISHED ENTREES THAT WERE TAKEN AWAY SHORTLY BEFORE THAT!? Well, we NEVER GOT THEM back... We then left because I'm not one to want to cause a scene but I did leave upset and extremely disappointed. The reason for the 2 stars I left was because I really did love the loaded potato tots and the red velvet cheesecake.

I ordered the shrimp platter which I thought was a safe basic easy choice and it did not disappoint. Both of my kids loved their dinners, spaghetti and meatballs, and chicken breast with veggies & mashed potatoes. Their tropical ice tea was yummy and they kept the refills going.  We took a piece of cheesecake home which my daughter scarfed down before anyone else could taste it.  We've since been there another 2 times and again the food was yummy.

Evelyn's is so appetizing that I have even tried recreating it in my own kitchen. Their house cab is great and full-bodied. The bread that comes before my entrée always comes out warm with a few cubes of butter. I always have to stop myself so I don't ruin my appetite before my entrée.  Service is great, but there is always a long wait on weekends. Luckily, they have comfy benches and chairs inside and outside while you wait.

I visited this location on a busy Saturday afternoon so it was a little crowded. It seems as though the staff here is a little rude and unprofessional, which was the first strike of my visit. The staff looks like a sketchy bunch as well.  The second strike which was the biggest, was the dirty environment of the restaurant. We were seated at the indoor patio which was a bit noisy, but it was hard to overlook the dirty seats that had food on them as well as a dirty table. The waitress who sat us clearly saw the dirt and was so lazy and unprofessional that she waited until we said something and had the nerve to have an attitude because she had to clean it.  The third strike was the dirty cutlery and utensils. I understand sometimes water spots dry on the silverware, but there shouldn't be FOOD on them. I believe we had to exchange 3 sets of cutlery until we were satisfied and even then I asked for steaming hot water to somewhat sterilize them because I cannot trust their cleanliness.  The food here was good and tasted like any other Cheesecake Factory food. BUT the calamari that I ordered which is usually quite delightful was gross. It was cold and soggy and seemed as though it had been sitting for an hour. We didn't get past the appetizers because of pure disgust.  My whole meal was thrown off by just a dirty environment.

However, we did see her standing around, talking to her coworkers. We were very unhappy with the service. We finally had to ask the server at the next table for refills. He got them for us and then told us he was going to be taking care of us instead of our original server. He was really nice and restored our faith in the service. After that we were highly satisfied. The next day my friend and I were both throwing up. So I called the restaurant and spoke to a manager just to let him know. I even told him I'm not blaming the food, I just wanted to bring it to your attention in case it happens to other people, maybe it's something they should look into. He rudely told me ""we serve hundreds of people everyday and they never get sick"" I told him ""I'm not complaining, I'm just making you aware of what happened"" and his response was ""okay thank you, bye"" and hung up on me.

710,Maggie B.,"Whittier, CA",0,10,,1.0,2016-12-30,"My visit last night had to be the worst restaurant experience of my life. I'm still in disbelief how bad it was. I went for a friends birthday and we had a big party (group of 20), we figured it would be a long wait, so a couple of my friends went early to put a name down at 6p. They said it would be two hours, so everyone else showed up around 7:30p. 8p came around and still nothing. The host said it would be 30 more min., so we wait and still nothing. We go ask again and they say 45 min. now. At this point everyone is angry and starving, so we ask why it was taking more than two hours. They said it was because the party in the big table they have for us is still there and they cant kick them out, which i get, but in those two hours why couldnt they set up another section for us. What really gets me angry is why they didnt let us make reservations in the first place. My friend had called the day before and they didnt let her make reservations. I think that is ridiculous, especially for her birthday. We didnt get seated till about 10p. On top of that, two people in our party didnt get their food till we were almost done eating. The manager came and apologized and gave a couple of free pieces of cheesecakes, but what does that do for the rest of the people that waited as well and didnt get anything. A lot of us had work super early the next day, and we didnt get out of there till about 1145p. I really suggest they allow people to make reservations, especially for big parties. Not trying to be rude, but a ""sorry"" isn't going to cut it. How does that make our situation better last night?

However when I went with friends this time. It was super delish and just as yummy as the first time I went.  Can I start off with that this is the first restaurant that I legit had to wait an hour for before getting seated. But it was worth it!! The food was so so delicious.  I'm going to start off with the complimentary bread n butter they serve. Haha. That stole our hearts n stomachs!! It's was so so so tasty. The butter was pure n melting into our mouths. Just perfection. A perfectly yummy complimentary item. I'm usually a fan of the white bread but at cheesecake I love their wheat bread. So soft and delish. Yummah!! Next up. Their menu is just like a little Children's book. A lot I options. I might say expensive but y'all know that going in. My friend and I shared and I'm so glad we did. Becuz the bread fills u up and I had left overs even with my half share.  I got the Louisiana chicken pasta with my friend. The sauce is perfection. The chicken is perfectly breaded and worked on top the pasta. The taste is something that u don't get tired of! I loved it. So so yummy. And all my friends tried and loved it too. Just yummmmyyy!! A must recommend if ur looking for a semi spicy sauce kick.  My other friend got a brunch item. N she said it's the best breakfast sandwich she's had. She loved it as well.  My other friend got the farafelle chicken pasta. (Don't remember full name) on the servers suggestion. She liked it but she said the sauce was too sweet n I agreed after trying. I don't like my pastas sweet.i like em with sauciness or spicy. So she wasn't as impressed with that dish.  Then we ended the night with a Reece's chocolate cake cheesecake. And that thing is pure sugar!! It's really yummy for a few bites but u must share that. I shared it with another friend but U really should share with like 4-5 ppl. A few bites is enuff. It's really tasty but really sugary. So just watch out for that.  Overall. Amazing experience. Lovely food. Great service. It's def worth coming at least a couple times a year.

Wish we met her from the beginning) Second, she forgot to give us straws and napkins. Third, she checked up on us once. Just once! As I was looking around, the waiter for the table next to me continuously checked on them, more then 5 times! (Yes I was counting) I even asked him for the straws because my waitress was no where to be found! This was a Thursday night & it wasn't busy at all. Lastly, the food was completely bland.

148,John B.,"Whittier, CA",55,120,35.0,2.0,2017-01-14,"UPDATE: So, per the below message from CF to email them via their website, I sent them a complete letter of everything that happened, including dates and times, and never heard back; it's been approximately two weeks, nothing. Pity. Going forward, and based our last experience, I advise anyone that goes to this restaurant and needs any kind of ACA accommodation to either speak with the manager right away, visit a different location, or look elsewhere. Anecdotally, my wife and I went to the Brea Mall location for years, and never once were I or anyone else in our party treated like this by the hosting staff. Caveat emptor. -- 1/14/2017 -- -- The wait staff and manager were very kind and accommodating. The food, as always, is delicious. However, their hosts and hostesses at the front of the restaurant are poorly, if not completely untrained with regard to ADA compliance and disability accommodation. If you have a disability, I would recommend simply asking for a manager up-front until their front line people are properly trained.  My party and I arrived at around 2:30pm on Friday afternoon. Two of us requires a place to sit for ADA-related reasons. The host did nothing to accommodate. We decided to sit in the bar area because there were empty seats available. A customer even offered my friend and I a seat bc it was obvious she and I were unable to stand stationary in the lobby.  Once my wife had finished parking the car, she came in to sit with us in the bar area. No sooner did the hostess tell us we had to leave.  We asked why, this was the bar area? The tables were not even bussed yet. We were told that the tables in the bar area are part of normal seating accommodation. We then asked for a place to sit while we wait for our main table, so she put a chair (1) outside--yes, really. Feelings of ostracism beginning to set in.  Once the hostess came back to tell us we could go sit outside in our one (1) chair , we explained that sitting outside would actually be more problematic because it required us to walk back outside before walking back in again, and getting up and sitting down and walking back/forth are painful.  The hostess then decides to put one (1) chair inside, in the main lobby, right by the front door where all the incoming and outgoing traffic was pushing and shoving its way by.  At this point, it was clear they did not want us here. I was ready to leave, so was my wife. Our pager went off and our table came up only to wait in one giant line for them to seat us. People coming in were even confused, asking repeatedly ""is this the line to sign in? No this is the line for getting a table."" People with walkers in front of us, being told to stand and wait in a long ""bread line"" while being shoved and/or gridlocked by wait staff and outgoing customers was just awful. It was pure chaos.  Finally, the waitstaff decided to sit us all the way in the very back of the restaurant, right next to the exit. I'm not kidding. All the way to the very back of the restaurant, right next to the exit.  We requested a manager immediately after being seated. Once the manager came out, he listen to our concerns, and explained that he would address this issue with the front staff. Apologies and understanding were offered, the rest of our visit was fine. Our waitress was excellent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=140,2.16,2.52,2.76,2.3120000000000003,2.3760000000000003

Today being my third visit and a reluctant one, that being said because my wife really wanted to go. OK let's go. We opted for bar seating to avoid the wait. Service was sluggish from the get go, took awhile to even get drinks no biggie but when this happens and then your presured to order also? I'm not really cool with that. Ordered drinks and my beer comes out after waiting almost 20 minutes and its the wrong beer. Trying to stay positive we order our meals. This being my third visit I can honestly say that this location does not know how to simply fry fried food dishes. Potatoes are greasy with burnt onions and peppers and we're definitely reheated and fried again, unedible. My waffles were OK my poached eggs were to perfection I will say. My wife's dish Monte Christo breakfast sandwhich. Another fried dish, served soggy, and a wet oily mess. 3x same experience this restaurant has has a beautiful decor a decent bar and great deserts but I will not be coming back to eat here ever again.

I do understand that this is a risk you take when you go to have dinner out at any place you go. Our server seemed annoyed, but then again it could have been attributed to her being overwhelmed with tables to cover. Would I go back here again? Perhaps. What is a concern I have that can be addressed? How about adding a feature that allows people to make reservations online? Reservations may help. *Update-management reached out to me through this comment on yelp and assured me that would be an isolated incident. That goes along way in showing the value of the customer.

She was attentive when my mom's pasta came out a lot saltier than expected, but it took forever to remake. She seemed a little frazzled, maybe a bad day? But nonetheless, she wasn't a very good waitress. We waited twenty minutes to get the cheesecakes for desserts, one for here and one to go.

We hung out inside the mall while we waited for our food. Gave them 40 mins and we parked in curbside. Called the number, asked if we had to go inside to pick up our food or wait outside and she said yes to come inside. Waited 15 mins inside in their unorganized line. Made it to the front, girl said our food is ready but the curbside attendant had our check and we had to go back to our car so she can deliever the food.. WTF?? Why did they say to come inside then.. she said our server will be right out, so we walked back out to my car, waited 10 mins, called the curbside # again, apparently a manager answered and we told her what was going on. She said she would have someone go out immediately with our food... another 10mins goes by and finally see a server come out with a small bag that no way could hold the food we ordered.. she told us our food was sitting in the front for us and we should've picked it up when we were inside.... ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!? She made it seem like it was our fault for not grabbing our food even though the to go cashier said spefically to go back out to our car and someone would come with our food and check... she explained she had our cheesecakes but since the food was up at the front for so long it might be cold. She asked if we wanted to take it or wait another 15 mins and they could remake it. UHM NO! It was over an hour since I ordered my to go food and I didn't want to waste anymore time.

She went back in to charge me for the cheesecakes and came out with my food. She apologized and said they had a communication problem with the cashier up front. She gave me our original food order that was sitting up front for us and said it was no charge. They still charged us for the cheesecakes though. Total time 1hr and 25mins!

233,Myrrh H.,"Long Beach, CA",46,3,,1.0,2017-02-16,"TERRIBLE SERVICE! I recently ordered a Large Strawberry Cheesecake to pick up for an office birthday.  The original plan was to pick up at 12 noon and have it around 2:00 pm which would give it plenty of time to thaw.  However, the plans changed on the day of pick up.  I phoned around 10 am to tell them to take out earlier as I would pick up by 12:30 pm and we would be having the cheesecake at 1:00 pm.  I was assured they would do this and it would be no problem. So I get there at 12:25 pm to pick up the cheesecake.  The girl finds my ticket and I pay her with a credit card.  After that the girl at the counter looked lost trying to find my order.  She walked around looking confused for a bit and checked a few boxes but never really said anything to me.  She then opened a few fridge doors and again looked lost.  I asked her what was going on and where was my cheesecake?  She never really answered me, but left the counter again.  She spoke with a few employees but again still looked lost.  10 minutes has passed.  I finally had to yell loudly to get her attention and asked her what the problem was?  She told me she couldn't find our cheesecake and she was still looking.  I told her I had called to change the time for them to pull it out and would that change the location she was looking?  Once again, she looked lost and confused.  After 5 more minutes I told her to get a manager.  We had a party driving in for the birthday celebration at 1:00 pm and they could only stay for a short time.  So, I told her I had to get going as people were waiting for me to bring the cheesecake. It took awhile to get the manager.  He comes by and tells me don't worry we will take care of this?  But, again doesn't really explain what that means?  Once again I ask him, do you have my cheesecake or not?  Finally after 20 some minutes they say we have it.  However, they had not ""finished"" it.  They still had to put the strawberries on top, and the whipped cream border.  Really?  So the girl finishing the cheesecake could not have been slower.  It's now 1:00 and I still have no cheesecake and I'm about to blow.  My phone was blowing up with text messages asking where I was.... At 1:05 pm I finally get a ""finished"" cheesecake in a box, in a bag.  I told the gal I was not paying for it as this was ridiculous how long I had to wait.  She tells me, yes, we will take care of it.  So, I asked her for a credit receipt.  So, once again she is lost.  I told her to go get the manager, get me a credit receipt and bring it back to me.  Another 10 minutes goes by.  And FINALLY she brings me a credit receipt. I get back to the office and everyone is waiting.  The party who came by at 1:00 were already gone.  We sing happy birthday and go to cut the cheesecake.  It was so soft we couldn't get a decent slice out of it.  What a mess.  We will NEVER order another pickup order from here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=220,2.64,2.52,2.792,1.8920000000000003,2.568

The service was terrible. You could tell the waitress must hate her job. Right from the get-go she didn't look like she wanted to be there. She took our drink orders (a mojito and 2 waters). First, it took forever to get our drinks. When she finally does, it's the mojito, bread basket, but no waters. How does that sense? She says she'll be right back but it must have taken at least another 8-10 minutes to get us our WATERS! Throughout the entire evening she was inattentive. I had to ask her every single time if she could refill, once again, my water. When our food came, we didn't even have any silverware on our place and had to wait till she finally decided to show her face (someone else dropped off the food). The food on the other had did not disappoint, but this waitress truly needs to get another job because she just ruined any chance of me going here again.

She's been at work all day and just wanted a nice dinner at a place we usually don't go to. We arrive at 6:11p 1hr 10min wait no prob. When being seated the seater never said a word except ""Your waiter will be right with you."" Usually you're asked if you're celebrating anything or welcome. Then our waiter Kevin (Which he never introduced himself. We found from the Mgr.) asked what drinks we'd like he brought the waters out pretty promptly. Then took our orders and appetizers. Bought the appetizers. We're out of water... No offer to refill. Then the food came out by 2 different ppl that wasn't Kevin. Then my husband tells my sister she see's a hair on her plate. Now we're eating and she's not.  Then he comes back to let my sis know her plate is being remade. Since he still didn't offer to refill our drinks I had to stop him from walking off again (for 20mins like he's been doing for a hr already) to ask him. 8mins later he's back with the refills and brings the birthday girl a strawberry lemonade and says ""Oh they handed made the wrong drink"" and proceeds to sit it on the table. I was mad now. My daughter asked for a refill of LEMONADE not STRAWBERRY LEMONADE. Why did he even bring it to the table?!!! Like she gonna drink it anyway. No bring her the lemonade. That took another 6mins. Because his ass wasn't paying attention. He was SOOOOO unattentive. Then the Mgr. Holly (like Hollywood) comes out apologizing for the hair. & that's when we told her about our waiter and that's when we found out his name. She did comp my sister's food which was a great gesture. And switched our waiter. The replacement was engaging, attentive, funny I mean he had turned it around for me at this point. But THEN.. I got hit in the eye with a tomato from the ppl across from us. They had a special needs child (I hope) that was giving them a hard time with sitting still and not yelling. He broke a glass and in that moment my sister said I don't feel safe sitting here and NOT EVEN 40SECS later (as I get ready to sign the check) a tomato smack dead in my eye!! These guest was allowing their child and so were the workers They're just looking instead of telling someone in charge that they may need to ask a guest to leave that may cause harm to others. I then before leaving found Holly and informed her that I just paid $162 to have a bad experience and that she might want to address the guest that's allowing they're child to throw food across the place. Because that could've been a glass or knife in my eye. She just said sorry.

306,J P.,"Long Beach, CA",0,5,2.0,1.0,2017-03-12,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been one of my favorite restaurants. Because of their extensive menu.. However the Cerritos Location is horrendous, they have more misses than hits.   Went out yesterday evening, with my sister and some friends who also love the Cheesecake Factory. If you are going to charge high prices you need to back it up with quality food.  Luckily for you most  people settle for substandard food. Last night was probably the worst example of cooking, that I have ever experienced.   It is time to rethink your cooking staff and make some changes. Kevin the waiter was a nice guy, but never bothered to refill our water glasses. The bread and butter was great as usual... The appetizers were a dismal failure.   The crab cake bites were mushy and tasteless, the fried zucchini sticks were were not cooked, , the kale salad was not up to it's usual standard... the firecracker  salmon bites came out burnt and over cooked, although they did get replaced after our request. Everything that was ordered was below our expectations and tasteless. Everyone has a off night but this was ridiculous. The Kobe burger that was ordered was the only thing ordered last night that was good. My Farfalle Chicken Pasta W/ Garlic had great potential but the sauce was too sweet, I just couldn't eat it, which was sent back and replaced with the order of Bang Bang Chicken. When my plate arrived it was chicken and shrimp which I let pass,  it had a huge serving of rice in the middle of the plate surrounded and drowned by this sickening sweet sauce that made me gag, When I tried to eat it., there was not heat at all.  When the other 3 at my table tasted the sauce we all agreed that it was a disaster. I have had Bang Bang Chicken at Thai restaurants and it is not suppose to be that sweet. The Jambalaya Chicken Pasta was spicy but that was the only flavor profile that it had. The Chicken Cashew was also overly sweet and didn't have any flavor. Overall it was extremely disappointing... After looking forward all week to coming to Cheesecake Factory.  On top of spending  $160 or more. I don't have a problem spending money on great tasting food, because when the food is good that brings value to how much you are spending, When the food is substandard you feel sucker punched. We could have went somewhere else and had a better meal for the money. After a while it becomes meaningless when Management say they are ""sorry you didn't have a great experience"" because at the end of the day they still have your money in their pockets.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=300,2.32,2.54,2.788,1.956,2.452

We weren't trying to get anything free(and we didn't) we just wanted the drinks we wanted in the first place. When the manager PETER got involved it went downhill. He came up to our table and said ""So you guys said you're drinks were wrong? Our bartender has been making drinks for 15-20 years and he knows what he's doing. You're going to get the same drinks remade that you had before he didn't mess up.""  I tried to explain to him that I ordered a passion fruit mojito and I was brought a normal one, so it obviously wasn't correct. He didn't listen to me he just told me again that it will be the same. He could've just told us ""I'm sorry that the drinks were wrong we'll bring you the correct drinks right away.""

Drinks and bread is always served in a timely matter from the time we are seated. During busier days food will always take longer but not so long that you will be left filling yourself with bread.  Food is always delicious and well made. My favorite is the Alfredo and a mound of grated cheese over top.

I also told him the utensils were dirty and once had lettuce stuck to it, he apologized and had someone bring me new utensils.

While he was cleaning he managed to spark a conversation with us about our day. He was very charismatic and a professional at the same time. Throughout our dinner he was constantly hustling around the bar and always had a positive attitude. Management should definitely reward him.

Moving on, I'm not going to complain about the wait bc this place is known to be busy. Good for them. We arrived early bc they don't take reservations on the weekends. No problem, 45 minute wait, we walked the mall. Don't come here and not expect a wait. It's been like this for over 20 plus years.  6 of us ate here and ordered drinks too. The alcoholic beverages were super weak. The first vodka and 7 up was flat (no carbonation) and sent back.  I ordered the fresh vegetable salad...the radicchio ratio to lettuce made this a bitter salad. Will not order this again.  My BF ordered the buffalo blast and it was huge portion. He enjoyed it but it was basically fried chicken. He ran out of dipping sauce and needed more which was a challenge.  We also ordered the shrimp scampi which was good and the veggie burger which was dry and came without condiments. We waited 20 min for the server to come back to get the condiments. Basically a mediocre place that's kind of pricey these days. The only saving grace is its huge menu and proximity to the theater.

The location is great. It's at Los Cerritos Center near where the old Nordstrom used to be. The decor is typical Cheesecake and is nice. The servers are nice BUT the service is SLOW. As I write this I have been waiting an hour for my food. Just the food. Say nothing of the over hour wait for a table for 4. We are starving. And waiting.  And starving. And by the way can my server please take these menus now. I'm tired of bread. We drank all of our beverages. Food please. I literally could have gone to the grocery store and bought food and cooked it faster myself. I'm 2 mos. pregnant and this hunger is a mother.  Soooo...guess what. They didn't put our order in. After walking around and tracking down any server I could find they send the manager over who informs me my order was never placed in the kitchen.  This after I was repeatedly told it would be out soon.  I cried at that point. You read that right. I cried. All of my anger, frustration and hunger dissipated into tears. What does a pregnant lady have to do to get some food??? So the nice manager comped our food and we only paid for drinks.

But we still had errands to run that day so we were willing to split our group into two. We're all paying for our own food, so it wasn't mandatory for us all to sit together. We asked for two tables and the hostess acted as if we were asking for CF to pay for all of our food! She had to get her manager and see if it was okay. They gave us some bull about how this has disrupted things in the past. What?! Yeah, if we were all paying as one party, but we made it clear that we seven ADULTS would each be paying separately. Mind you, another party came in two minutes after us and was seated for their party of eight at the same time we got our two outside tables.

171,Shelley A.,"Long Beach, CA",8,8,4.0,3.0,2017-07-09,I loooove Cheesecake Factory but this location is  unorganized and small.  The only way to eat here and have a good experience is to come during an off time (during the weekday before or after the meal time rush). I made a reservation for 8 people for my friends birthday and we still waited for almost 2 hours. By the time we finally paid our bill and left we had spent almost 5 hours there. Plus...I don't even think anyone even ordered dessert! I have been to this location a few other times and enjoyed the experience BUT it was before the dinner rush during the weekday. The quality of the food is the same at the other locations but honestly...it might be worth it to drive a few more miles to another nearby location IF you're going during a busy meal time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=160,2.24,2.43,2.584,2.604,2.3540000000000005

307,Chloe E.,"Compton, CA",138,12,37.0,1.0,2017-07-27,"I must say this was one of the worst visits ever. U would think by saying this comment that a waiter threw a tray at me or the hostess cursed me out but this was neither. I always have a great experience at CCF and that's y it's me and my families favorite restaurant. I can't imagine any bad experience ever coming from this place. Yesterday, early evening, me, my mother, and my 4 children came in for dinner. I noticed the restaurant was pretty slow and not that many tables were occupied. My mom is disabled and in a wheelchair and I needed 1 high chair. We were told that there was a 20 min wait which confused me because the place was empty and where they usually seat us was empty also but I didn't sweat the small inconvenience. I am a new vegan so I asked the hostess if there were any dairy free desserts. She sharply replied I wouldn't know you have to go ask the people over there, referring to the dessert counter. Again, I felt whatever, I'm not going to sweat the small stuff. We waited and was seated, guess where?! I wondered why we had to wait in the first place but it's cool. We are all in good spirits and I'm extremely interested in what was available for me for vegan choices. The waitress was great. I forgot her name but she was very attentive, warm, informative and had a great smile. My children ordered from the kids menu and my older son ordered the classic cheeseburger. My mom ordered her favorite catfish but wanted no mashed potatoes because she suffers from renal failure and can't have it. She subbed for a salad. My children also ordered the sliders from the kids meal and I got Evelyn Favorite Pasta which was AMAZING. Here is where it got extremely irritating. There was a shift change and our new waiter took over. At first he seemed ok but that changed once our food was delivered which took the longest I have ever waited here. My order was ok, my older son's order was ok, but my children were brought 2 classic burgers instead of the kid sliders. My mom was brought her food with what looked like double the mash potatoes and a pinch of corn. I alerted the waiter that delivered the food that it was wrong. Our actual waiter seemed upset at that even though he didn't take the order and it wasn't his fault. it was a miscommunication that we weren't even mad about. Things happen.. Anyhow, my mom told him her order was wrong and what needed to be fixed and he walked away looking angry. I watched his response and demeanor every time he walked away and it was a very negative attitude which got me upset as if we was inconveniencing him. The one thing that got me super upset is when my son asked for a refill on his Apple juice. He told us that they didn't refill Apple juice and that I would have to pay the price over... no big deal, the waitress before refilled it and don't mention that so I didn't know it wasn't refillable. He offered my son another beverage and mentioned lemonade and my son accepted. This time when he walked away, he frowned and said something under his breath to which everyone at the table saw. At that point I walked out and told my mother I'll be back.. I needed some fresh air. I came back to my mom talking to the waiter about the additional charge for the beverage he offered my son and I just said forget it. I'll pay it. $2 dollars is nothing, I just wanted to go. I was upset. This really was the worst experience I have had at ur restaurants. I want to note something. I understand that people are not gonna like everyone that walks in the door. God knows me and my family weren't disrespectful or loud or irritating. Corrections needed to be made for the mistake that was done and that's all we wanted. And we wanted that with a positive attitude. I want u to know that we pay attention. Your customers pay attention to body language and attitudes and watch you walk away and watch you walk to the tables.. I don't know anyone that never is looking for their waiter in a restaurant. I also understand that things can get hectic and you are not always in the best of mood but the industry that your employees decided to work in is dealing with the public WHICH MEANS u give the best possible experience to that customer that supports your paycheck. I am self employed. I own a very successful salon in Bellflower and I treat my clients like gold.. There are times I'm physically tired or upset and don't want to work but I make sure my clients never feel that from me. Please, take a second to remind your employees who they r there for. I know some people are hard to deal with but we were nothing but polite in this situation and was treated like we were bothering our waiter. The high point is the food. Amazing food for the price point but the highlight in ANY service job is the customer service. That's key over everything. I feel I wasted $80 because of the service. I usually tip 20% and more because i know how much tips are appreciated in this field but with that service I couldn't do it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=300,2.6,2.48,2.568,2.116,2.528

118,Castillo V.,"Long Beach, CA",0,2,1.0,1.0,2017-07-30,"I am an avid yelp searcher, but never write reviews, however my most recent visit to this location warranted a review. My boyfriend and I love Cheesecake Factory and I'd been craving it so despite the fact that they said it was a 40 min wait and we'd been waiting over an hour we were excited to eat.  We were finally seated and the table was still dirty and greasy which wasn't a huge deal but still annoying. They cleaned our table, we ordered our food promptly with no issues, but then our order comes out and my boyfriends order was partially wrong. He had asked for mac and cheese and didn't receive it. He starts eating anyways and cuts into the chicken and the chicken is STILL RAW. So we talk to the manager and he asks to replace it so we order a club sandwich.  They bring the mac and cheese out after he ordered the sandwich. The mac they brought out wasn't cooked. They melted the top layer and the rest of the macaroni was cold, hard and undercooked. So then by the time they brought out a new macaroni and cheese they had already brought out a club sandwich so we no longer needed the Mac and cheese.  On to the bill, after talking to the manager about the raw food, the cold mac & cheese and the delays in bringing it all out (I finished my entire meal before it was all resolved) they charged everything wrong. We were charged twice for the raw chicken plate and then they  ""fixed"" it and took 1 off even though management had apologized and ""fixed"" it to where we wouldn't be charged for the raw chicken. So again we were forced to go through the manager to fix things again.  We had dessert to top it all off . We each ordered a slice of cheesecake and because we are regular customers we know they usually give the cheesecake in the slice shaped containers. Our cheesecake was given to us in regular to go boxes, which wouldn't have been an issue if the cheesecake wasn't thrown in and smashed into the box. At this point the manager has been kind enough to help us out at every turn so we didn't  want to bother him anymore and casually asked the lady at the to go cheesecake counter if they were out of cheesecake boxes and she says no. Then we tell her how our cheesecake looked like it was just thrown into a to go container. Her response wasn't even to our concern she just said well the promotion is dine in only. My boyfriend was very upset and said I don't give a fuck about the promotion after everything that's happened today. The lady begins to make a scene because he cussed. I normally wouldn't condone cussing in such a public place either, but with everything going wrong it's understandable that he would feel the need to say it.  Overall the quality of this place needs to be reevaluated. The food temperature and quality of food and service shouldn't suffer just because it's busy, which the manager did acknowledge but all efforts he gave to fix things were constantly being messed up by the rest of the staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=80,2.68,2.55,2.56,2.116,2.6020000000000003

The Management is extremely poor considering they can not contain the traffic. Its bad enough that the wait time is atrocious then, as you get seated that is another half of your day consumed waiting for a server. And finally, another 45 minutes if u get lucky to wait for the food to be served. Overall, if you want to dine here be prepared that the only agenda you have for the entire day will be allocated for this reataurant. The food is not even fantastic. The salad that I ordered was supposed to be endive and when it finally arrived the salad was filled by pieces of vegies that came from the end part of it which you can imagine the hard tail part.  By the time we started eating I was mostly upset already due to the extreme wait period. I do not recommend this place if you are a busy person and up and running on  a busy day.

Great service from the bar, able to serve me from a crowded bar even though no seats available! Bartender 4 stars!  Now this is where it goes sideways. Able to get a bar table, but it was not cleaned yet. I was able to get the attention of a busperson, but that took a few minutes. The rest of my party then joined me, but still waiting for the table to be fully cleaned. We were expecting more to join us, so when the 2 tables next to us left, we took those tables also. I asked a server for some menus and take some drink orders, but replied ""I am really, really busy and be with you soon."" Yes, it was busy, but we had been sitting there for 10 or so minutes and we were never acknowledged. (I believe Cheesecake Factory has 4 table stations and we sat at 3 of them).  We then watched you go to a manager and speak with him at length and this is where it gets strange. The manager approaches and asked about the size of our party and wanted to know if we wanted a dining room table. We told him that we had our name in (13 in our party) and we were here to celebrate a retirement and we're quoted 4 Hours!! Really, 4 Hours!! At 7 pm on a Sunday. Then, the hilarity begins. He accused us of eating off the plates that were on the table and drinking from the remaining drinks!!  WAIT - WHAT,,, Eating and Drinking from an unbussed table? That's when a member of our party told him we were very insulted that he would even suggest such behavior! I told him I purchased a bottle of wine at the bar as well as other drinks and these were not ""other people's"" drinks. He then suggested we take our drinks outside and wait for our table there.  WAIT- WHAT,,, Take our drinks outside? Did you really suggest that? Do YOU know the terms of your Liquor License? I don't think that is a viable solution? Plus, we were in the bar area which was a comfortable place to drink and wait. At that point, the manager back peddled and decided to get us a pager and a one hour quote! During this back and forth exchange, which lasted 10 more minutes, the 3 tables finally got cleaned and menus brought over. We also asked for a different server and decided to dine in the bar area.  Our new server stepped up and DELIVERED the Service I've come to know and get from CF. Drink, food and requests were taken promptly. Everything arrived smoothly. She checked back at all the right moments, with the manager making ONE half hearted follow up. Entrees and desserts all delicious!

I didnt think nachos could turn out disgusting but they did. Soggy and nasty. My friend ordered a veggie burger and she only took 1 bite. I tried it and it was the worst veggie burger I've tried.

I expected this restaurant to be one with a bit of class but Instead it was more like a buffet type of feel. It's unorganized and people are everywhere. Yes I did go on a Sunday but my experience is incomprehensible.   I was told my wait time would be 25 min. But I think it was shorter. I got up from my seat to stand in another line just to be seated. A gentleman and his wife and child were in front of me. Somehow, 15-20 later I realized something was wrong ... people behind us were being seated way before us. I asked the young girl at the desk and she appeared to look into it. Another 7-10 min later ... I had to bring it up again but to another host. Somehow both the gentlemen and my name got lost and forgotten. I don't understand how no one asked us any questions on why we were standing there all that time. It took me to figure out that one out.  So we are seated. It took about 20min for someone to appear out of the whole chaos to ask if we wanted drinks.  The food was ok. But when I go to a restaurant I don't want to be felt like I'm in a cattle call. I don't want to be forgotten and have to speak up for my fellow patrons just to be noticed. There were plenty of hosts around who saw us and failed to ask us if we needed help.

117,Georgianna C.,"Orange, CA",69,2,,1.0,2017-08-23,"Experienced horrible service for the first time today.  The waitress we had was Amanda (blonde hair and glasses). My friend, who is very small and petite, doesn't eat a lot and wanted to order fettuccine alfredo from the kids menu. We were very polite about asking and informed her that a previous waiter from this same Cheesecake factory had provided it without any question. Amanda ended up bringing out her manager, Peter (Indian with glasses), who only proceeded to make the situation worse. What really irked me was that he walked away mid-conversation. He's the manager and he couldn't even stand there and hear us out. We were not yelling, just expressing our frustration. As a manager, he lacked people skills. We understood that they were trying to enforce only children ordering from the menu. However, my friend brought her 10 year old sister who also ordered a kids chicken alfredo. We asked if her sister can just order 2 and Peter insisted that she wouldn't be able to finish 2 plates. My friend then proceeded to say that she would eat the second plate. The manager then replied with ""No, only children can eat it."" But its not like the waitress or waiter is gonna stand there and watch who eats what plate. That's like telling a mom she can't eat off of her child's plate because it's only for kids. It's ridiculous. I mean we DID have a child with us, it's not like it was all adults. Not to mention, they didn't do anything to try and accommodate us. We're paying customers, we weren't trying to get anything free or cause a big deal, we literally just wanted to order and have a good night. The least they could have done was offer a free dessert or something for the trouble they were giving us.  To wrap up what happened, the manager settled on giving us a kids chicken alfredo to-go. But it wouldn't be brought out with the rest of the food, just whenever it's done. So my friend was going to settle on watching us eat, while waiting for her food.  Luckily, we received a new waiter (Arthur A.) who accommodated us and handled the situation professionally. Just the fact that he was able to communicate with us instead of giving an attitude or walking away completely diffused the situation. He ended up getting us the kids chicken alfredo and brought it out with the rest of the food. He should have been the manager, due to his customer service skills. Honestly. Highlight: As we were getting seated, before all of this started, the Hostess was talking about how she ALWAYS orders off of the kids menu. When I told her that i've been denied ordering from the kids menu before at other restaurants, she was shocked.  The manager made it clear that they are really trying to enforce only kids eating from that menu, yet some of their workers aren't aware?

We approached the podium with a total of 3 people  40 minutes later they seat us at 4:50pm  There are 10 in our party  We are directed back to the podium and wait for a manager  Manager comes over and doesn't ask us about the situation nor does he apologize. He states it will be 2 hours  I stated that we just waited 40 minutes He said it went from a party of 3 to 10  My response and thoughts:  I stated to the manager and the hostess who took our name, she didn't ask us about the size of our party. Is that our fault that she put us down as a party of 3?  He said no  I asked him for the corporate number and for his name...1 (818) 377-8000, Peter  Not once did I receive an apology. I immediately called the corporate number but there was no answer. I asked Peter if this was a real number and he said ""yes, but the office is closed on the weekend""  Luckily, the bar had seating open up that was large enough to accommodate us. Peter had his team set the table up and managed to seat our party in a reasonable amount of time.  My main problem with everything is how the situation was handled. I understand that the restaurants might have been busy, but the manager did not even stop and take a moment to investigate the issue. He did not bother to find out where the problem started such as the party size being inaccurately recorded by the hostess. Peter simply stated that it would take 2 hours. That would make our total wait time be over 2 hours and 40 minutes from the time we arrived at the hostess podium, 4:10pm. Please put yourselves in our shoes and take a moment to analyze the problem from the customer's point of view. It seemed clear that our situation was a nuisance and the restaurant did not want to deal with it. The easiest solution for the manager was to jump to the conclusion that the wait would be an additional 2 hours and if we didn't like that answer, then he seemed sure to allow us to leave without feeling any remorse Peter did end up finding us a table, but I personally feel that it was because I was immediately prepared to report this situation to the corporation. Peter did check on us after the server took our drink order. However, no apology which shows me a lack of compassion. I feel that he wanted to avoid a formal customer complaint. I hope he properly trains his hostess who served as our initial contact for this visit.

We ordered fried mac and cheese as the appetizer, my bf ordered the chicken and waffles, which comes with maple syrup. I ordered the chilaquiles, which comes with sour cream. The server brought out our waters and I asked for straws and lemon. We never got them. I had to ask again. And he handed the straws to another server and had her give them to us. So I asked her for lemons, and she got them to us right away. Our food came out, again, brought out by someone else, and the man told us the appetizer had to be ""remade because of some kitchen issues"". Apparently, the kitchen had a lot of issues, and they weren't the only ones. The chicken and waffles didn't come out with the syrup, and the chilaquiles didn't have sour cream. Our original server NEVER came to check up on us. I had to as another server, again, for syrup and sour cream. Our server saw me ask someone else for help, so he mosied on over and asked how everything came out. I told him everything didn't come out. And asked him, to be sure, if the chicken came with syrup, and if the chilaquiles came with sour cream. He was like, ""uh...I think so"". Seriously? Then he looks at us and LITERALLY asked, ""so do you guys still want the syrup and sour cream?""  DUDE. Why are you working as a server in a restaurant?  We told him yeah. And asked about our appetizer. He said he'll ""check up on it."" Of course, someone else brought out the syrup and sour cream. Our food was cold by now.

I had the fried catfish and the crust was bizarre, something akin to a hush puppy texture including what seemed to be onions.  Being from Louisiana that is not how you batter catfish.  Our waitress had to beg the kitchen to plate my green beans separately as they are more concerned about the 'plate aesthetic' than this customer desire not to have wet food contact what should have been crispy fish.

272,Missy L.,"Long Beach, CA",0,2,,3.0,2017-09-18,Came in close to 4pm and wait time took about 10 minutes which was perfect. Our server however seemed very rushed and very unhappy. Before my boyfriend could order his drink he was interrupted by the server who said he needed to bring us bread and then brought him the wrong drink. When he came to refill drinks I had barely drank my water and he overfilled so it spilled on the floor. During all this he would also interrupt a conversation by just speaking immediately when he came to the table while seemingly annoyed. Overall the food was amazing just the experience with the server was not what we desired.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=260,2.8,2.6,2.548,2.316,2.68

We waited about 30mins to get a table and then our server seemed as if she didn't want to work, she had an attitude and made us feel unwelcomed and uncomfortable. Sorry but servers should actually make customers feel welcomed and appreciated, because without customers you don't have a job. It took like another 20-25mins for our food to get to the table and that was a loonnnggg wait. Once we recieved our food the sauce from the chicken madiera tasted burnt as if they overcooked or burn the butter and didn't bother to make a new sauce...and the Chicken also had a foul taste, its frustrating because my husband and I were celebrating our anniversary, so you know we came to have a great night but the bad service killed the night. And let me tell you it isn't cheap, I literally wasted my money for nothing.

We ordered: Cajun chicken and shrimp jambalaya, BBQ chicken pizza, chicken bellagio, and the chicken carbonara.  The Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta is normally a fave, but the pasta was extremely overcooked that it looked like one soggy mess. I had to return it bc it was inedible, but the second go around wasn't any better. It was kind of disappointing (the pasta was cooked fine, but then there was little sauce and little protein which was awkward bc the first time was fine).  The BBQ chicken pizza had no cheese on it.

58,Paolo A.,"Cerritos, CA",16,28,19.0,1.0,2017-09-24,"I have been here previously a couple of times, but I am compelled to write this review tonight based on the terrible service, disingenuous attitude the staff and management have towards their customers; and the downhill quality of the food. Party of four arrive around 9:35pm; with wait time of 40mins, we got our table earlier than expected. We were seated near the back, close to the outside patio where the mall is. Strike one - Floors excessively slippery, my friend almost tripped on her heels. We were then seated and attended by our Waiter, let's call him Jesus G. He quickly got our drink orders, and our drinks were served quite fast. Strike two -However, it took him around 15-20 minutes to get back to our table to get our orders for the entrees, after i casually blurted out that I was starving and a coworker of his overheard me. And it took him another 10 minutes until I actually asked for the complementary Bread and butter, to which he would NOT have offered until we asked.  Strike four- The bread tasted terrible, it tasted like old stale bread that was heated up in the microwave. Very rubbery, and our butter was served in a dish, opened already. I am accustomed to individualized butter enclosed in silver wrapping, and cold. This butter was warmed and melting all over the place.  My Carbonara with shrimp was good, my friends ordered Chicken Pasta dish and a Jambalaya pasta dish.  Now quick backstory, my friend, let's call her Pang, we both work as nursing consultants and travel around California. We had lunch at a Cheesecake factory in Riverside. It was her first time to try the Jambalaya pasta, and it was quite delicious. Strike 5- To our dismay; the Jambalaya dish came out extremely dark, had green noodles, and tasted like burnt rubber with Creole spices sprinkled on it to mask the burnt flavor. By the time our Cheesecakes have arrived, my friend Pang had barely touched her Jambalaya, and I realized that it was inedible. I would not feed that to my dog.  At that point, I was pretty stuffed, and had to save room for the cheesecakes. I had told our waiter, Jesus G that we would like to speak to the manager regarding the Jambalaya, and I would like a container for my Carbonara ( which had more than 1/2 portion left). To my surprise he took my Plate, and said he could not do anything about the food but the manager could. I thought to myself, oh how nice, he'll put it in a box for me. Last and final strike - After around 15 minutes, he comes back to the table and tells us that he informed the manager, and that she authorized him to tell us that we wouldn't be charged for the Jambalaya. Okay... so I asked him, where my Carbonara was. He looks at me stunned, and said 'I thought you said you were done, so I threw it' At this point, I was already getting to the point where I would start acting like a Bitch, so I politely told him that I would like to speak to the manager. Everyone in the table, ASIDES FROM JESUS G, had heard that I wanted to take home the REST OF MY PASTA. I let the Manager have it! And boy, I told her off! I threw Shade, like major Shade...And i almost felt kind of bad, because she looked like she was about to cry. In her defense, she did refund the Jambalaya and the Carbonara. But that experience in itself was so terrible, that I advise you, reader, to go elsewhere. It killed the mood of our conversation, and instead of having a pleasant dinner, our night was ruined instead.  And no amount of I'm sorry, or How can we make it better can ever compare to wasted time and energy. I feel sorry for restaurants like this who do not understand that customer service and great food is what is needed to keep a business like this running. I give this location two to three years tops, with the way things are being run, even less. Look at Elephant Bar, filed for bankruptcy and closed its locations in my nearby vicinity. I foresee that happening for this chain, if things do not change. Edit: just realized that I skipped strike three, and after three strikes you're out! So fellow yelpers,  I have given these people more than 6 chances okay. My patience and tolerance with dealing with incompetence was unusually long today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=20,2.52,2.56,2.548,2.148,2.544

I asked a few different people for a kids menu before ended up getting one, my uncle had to wait quite a while for some shredded cheese for his pasta, The food itself took quite a while to get to the table, and the drinks all got pretty low before we were offered refills. Toward the end I ended up going to the separate cheesecake line to order something to go because our server took too long to get back to us. I tried the enchiladas, they were very good, side dishes included (black beans and rice). My dish was the shepherds pie (one of my favorites), and it was delicious just the right amount of everything. My daughter had a cheese pizza which she enjoyed, my uncle had the shrimp and sausage pasta which I also tried, and was very delicious as well.

7,Tae G.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,765,1929.0,1.0,2017-10-14,"This place went from poor to worse the second time around. It can shut down as far as I'm concerned.  Went here on 9/11 for a birthday dinner. It took at least 30 minutes to get seated even though the place was damn-near empty. Strike 1! Our party of 9 was greeted by Alex. With the exception of 1 person, everyone was there and ordered at the same time. All food came roughly 30 minutes later except mine (herb crusted salmon) and another friend's salad of all things. Strike 2!  We asked what the hold up was and was told by manager Sara that the salad was mistakenly taken to another table and had to be remade. Duhh! My salmon? No clue except that it was being taken care of by the kitchen.  When my food finally came, I checked the salmon because I asked for it to be cooked very well done. It was the total opposite -.still jiggly pink and mushy in the middle! Strike 3!  I asked Alex to have the cooks refry it until it was basically dried out. It couldn't be that difficult since I didn't ask for a new plate, right? Lol! In the meantime, other friends began complaining about their food. One's pasta was dry and lacked sauce. One's jambalaya came with pasta but the order specifically asked for rice. Other waitresses helped Alex deliver food to the table, didn't know who ordered what, and the each other under the bus for all of the mistakes. All this went on on while my salmon was still not done. Strike 4!  Finally, the manager, Sara comes over and apologizes for so many mishaps. She assures us our food would be taken care of, tells me my salmon was being cooked to perfection, and offered free soup or appetizer to me and the friend who was missing her salad. No appetizers ever came. Strike 5! We kept hearing people yelling in the kitchen and wondered if it was the cooks. Lol. After a few more f**ked up meals, sending food back, and complaints, the rude ass kitchen manager named Mycella comes to the table with a shitty attitude. She tried to convince my friend to keep his jambalaya which HER cooks made wrong! Nope! Then Mycella had a debate with another friend about whether or not she ordered her meal at the same time as the rest of us because her food was also missing. Strike 6 and an ass beating for Mycella!   By this time, my salmon was STILL nowhere to be found. I asked Sara if it be cancelled or comped. She pitifully tells me she couldn't do anything to assist because her superior wouldn't allow it. Wth?? I've never, EVER heard a manager at a restaurant say he/she could not assist. I asked if the ""superior"" was on site, which he was, then asked to speak with Chris so I could file a formal complaint. Strike 7! Before Chris comes over, my salmon came. For the 3rd time, it was still soft and undercooked. The cooks added extra blackening to the top and rewarmed it, but did NOT cook the salmon well like I asked. By this time, I was pissed, no longer hungry, and all of my people were ready to leave. I politely spoke with Chris and showed him my undercooked salmon. As I expressed my disapoointment with the overall lack of quality food, concern, wait time, the fact that Sara said she couldn't help, Mycella's poor attitude, and that I was going to file a complaint with their corporate department, he looks baffled and tells me he was apologetic and unaware of the problems. How in the hell was that possible for as long as we were in the restaurant and with as many orders we sent back??? Strike 8! After all that, Chris comped my meal and a few others. The jambalaya was cooked correctly, the birthday girl got her cheesecake, and we got the hell out of there!  Kudos to Victor for trying to be helpful.  Whatever the omen was there that night, 3 times will NOT be a charm.

I was excited to eat here because of the variety of cheesecakes and the fact that I could watch my Dodgers game. I started with my waitress being Britney and she was very nice, but immediately she handed us over to Kevin because she was leaving. Kevin was no where to be found. I did eventually get my food, but he wasn't the one to bring it. Almost a half hour went by (no, I'm not being sarcastic) so I took my drink to the bar to ask for it to be refilled and the bartender looked and acted so annoyed. If you're annoyed, imagine how I feel? I'm literally leaving my table and food to get myself my own drink. Kevin finally comes around since I'm sure word spread to him that I had left to catch my own drink. My friend asks for more water, he never came back. Right away at least and when he did, no water. He forgot I'm assuming. Since Kevin was no where to be found once again, we flagged down a different server (he was Asian, don't know his name) and my friend asked him what was in the carrot cake and he did go ask which was nice, but the second he came back we informed him that my friend is allergic to pineapple that's why we were asking and I kid you not, he rolls his eyes and goes, ""You could have just asked me that."" My friend apologizes and literally as she's ordering a different cheesecake, he walks away. It was so ridiculous we couldn't help but laugh because I almost thought we were being pranked. We finally see Kevin and inform him about the incident and all he had to say was how the server must have been busy and that we should know how it gets working with people. Although I get he was trying to be funny, it wasn't appropriate seeing as I'm considered ""people."" Long story short, service was just bad and unprofessional. Busy or not, it was unacceptable. As for my food, I got the huevos rancheros and I pretty much left most of it. My tortillas were so hard, I couldn't even cut through them.

Now, I've never been to a place that asked me how I'd like my burger cooked, but when our Server asked, I said rare, she gave a little grin, or was it a smirk, was it a grin of love? or a smirk of TF you eating a rare burger for? Anyway we had a moment, a connection if you will over my love of barely cooked meats. Anyway, the bacon bacon burger is quite tasty. The patty just melted in my mouth and everyone else liked their meals. Potsticker app was quite good and sauce was lovely enough to dip my bread in. There wasn't really anything special about this place. It was busy, but our Server came by and checked up on us frequently, omg, please come back and ask me if I need more water, even though my glass is full, I just want to stare at you in a non creeper way while I shove this bacon into my mouth. CLASSY. Food was good, parking was alright, cost was typical.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=20,2.52,2.6,2.528,2.54,2.568

It was my GF birthday and with our schedules we did not have time to go to the other location that we have always been pleased with in every way . So we visited the Cerritos location once again. At first it was pleasant , easy parking and we were seated promptly at the same booth as we had been seated in our previous visit. The waiter offered us perfect service yet giving us time alone to talk witch we always need. We like to order our food from the pictures on YELP versus the menu but cell phone service and WiFi is hard to receive in the restaurant . Our appetizers, drinks and entrees were prepared and offered at perfect timing, the manager happen to be walking by and asked how everything and we replied with very satisfied responses , however I did not know it was the manager or some random customer walking by till later as I saw her assisting others. I wish I would have known she was the manager at the time. All in all my steak Diane and her Bistro shrimp pasta was worth the trip back  My bad points : The booth we were sat st should be the last booth ever used . There is a machine they use on the back side of the booth that rumbles the whole booth and is quite loud  And there should be stronger WiFi available for those that use Yelp to view the menu  Other then that our time and meal were perfectly utilized",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=80,2.56,2.59,2.524,2.576,2.5780000000000003

6,Linda M.,"Westminster, CA",63,304,190.0,5.0,2017-11-12,"Love Cheesecake Factory!!! I like how it's close to the movie theater.  My husband and I would catch a 9/9:30/10/10:30AM movie and would dine here afterwards, which is usually around lunch time.  By the time we get to Cheesecake Factory, there would be a handful of more parties waiting before us.  Since it's just the 2 of us, or wait is usually 10 to 15 minutes.  Longest I've waited during prime eating time was 30 minutes.   I usually order a pasta dish along with some appetizers.  Our usual appetizers are the potato tots, fried zucchini and fried mac and cheese.  My usual pasta is the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic.  I get the dinner portion so I can eat the leftovers that night.  My husband usually orders the taco plate, club sandwich plate, or a breakfast burrito.   Everything always taste delicious, full of flavor.  I also love their bread basket.  I always eat all the sourdough and my husband would eat the honey wheat.  The wait for food hasn't been long, I haven't sat there and thought to myself ""wonder what's taking so long?""

We were seated in the patio area and waited over 10 minutes with no drinks or bread. My husband ended up having to go to the front desk to inquire about our waitress. Finally, about five minutes later, the waitress came to take our drink order without any apology or acknowledgement of the wait time. We told her that we wanted 3 waters with lemon and we also ordered our food since we were unsure when we would see her again. We then waited another 10 minutes before she brought our waters WITHOUT lemon. We reminded her of the lemons and once again, no acknowledgment of the oversight, said she would get us some lemons. Another 5-10 minutes passed and she brought drinks out for the other tables, walked passed us several times with no lemons. By that point, we asked the hostess if we could be seated in another area because we could already tell this dining experience was going to be terrible. She said she was going to get the manager. About 10 minutes later, the manager walked past us and dropped something off at another table. She didn't even acknowledge us and went back inside the restaurant. We waited another 10 minutes thinking she was just busy and she never came. By this point, we told the hostess that we were leaving.  I absolutely refuse to patronize this location ever again.

4,Derek W.,"Lakewood, CA",373,167,1291.0,2.0,2017-12-17,"I came in a group of about 24 on a Thursday afternoon at 1 PM. We were assigned to a long table at the near end of the outdoor patio, so there was no need to go indoors. A cheesecake lover myself, I was looking forward to munching on the delicacy at its namesake factory on the west side of Los Cerritos Center. After my meal there, I learned a pretty big lesson: Just because you are a big fan of cheesecake does NOT mean that you are also a big fan of Cheesecake Factory. Having never made the trek over to a Cheesecake Factory in my life, I was more than looking forward to having one of my favorite desserts there. After all, how can you go to Cheesecake Factory and not have a bite of cheesecake??? With so many different types of cheesecakes to choose from, there will be one that will certainly lure your eyes and tell you to pick it! For me, the chosen one was Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake. I love caramel. I love peanut butter. I love Butterfingers. I love Reese's. Certainly, this had to be a dessert I would love! Right? Not so fast...I had to get through my Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo first alongside a side of corn succotash before I could finally set my eyes on the APBCFRC (read the previous paragraph to decode the acronym). Despite the fact that our reservation was at 1 PM, we actually didn't get our food until just past 1:30 PM. I reckon we could have circumnavigated the mall during our wait. At least my strawberry lemonade and the starter bread kept me company. The gumbo contains shrimp, chicken, andouille sausage, tomatoes, peppers, onions, and garlic simmered in a spicy Cajun Style Broth with Cream. It also came with a mound of white rice on top. It wasn't terribly bad, but after a few bites, my taste buds sensed an incredible amount of cream in my gumbo! Coupled with the fact that the bowl itself was much larger than I expected, I immediately knew that I was NOT going to finish all that in one sitting as I could sense my mind going crazy screaming, ""CREAM OVERLOAD!!! CREAM OVERLOAD!!!"" The corn succotash contains mostly corn mixed with some other vegetables. Not a bad side overall. Gave me a nice break from having to deal with all that cream in the gumbo, but could have used more flavor in my opinion. A few ordered fries in my group. One of them got fries in a bowl about the size of my gumbo bowl, and another got fries in a cup alongside his turkey burger, to which he said, ""It was alright, but I've had better."" I tried both fries. They weren't bad, but for some reason, they tasted a little different to me. Knowing that the APBCFRC was yet to come, I made no effort to finish the gumbo or even the corn succotash to save room for the cake. Our waitress asked us all if we wanted takeout boxes. I shot my hand up and several others did too. She also brought us some bags to carry our boxes in. We actually had to wait a long time as well for our cheesecake...about 45 minutes after receiving our main course. I was only eating for about half that time, and I spent the other half thinking about how good my cheesecake would taste and how it would make up for the mediocrity of the main course of my meal. Or so I thought... My APBCFRC came, and it was the smallest compared to everyone else's cheesecakes! I took a bite, and I immediately knew why it was the smallest. It was so tightly condensed that I couldn't taste much of what the APBCFRC was supposed to have! I guess too much of a good thing really isn't a good thing after all. The cheesecake I'm used to having is much less dense and flavorful. Unfortunately, the APBCFRC turned out to be a disappointment for my peanut-butterfinger loving taste buds. What should have been an awesome dessert ended up as a total flop. *FACEPALM* The tables weren't particularly large enough for the dishes I ordered, so my claustrophobia kicked in while I was munching on my gumbo & corn succotash. I also almost mistook my takeout box for someone else's! Everyone else seemed to enjoy themselves with the dishes they had, but I guess I must have been left with the bad egg out of the two dozen. Would I consider coming back? If I do, I'm certainly not eating any of the same dishes again. I was anything but impressed. I'd be curious to try their other dishes, but this time around, my expectations for a great dining experience at Cheesecake Factory have plummeted like a Stock Market crash. Ever have one of those times when you were looking forward to the food at a restaurant you've been wanting to try and you enjoy your first bites, but the subsequent bites make you wish you had ordered something else? And when you save the best for last, it turns out it's not really the best? Yeah...that just about summarizes my first ever visit to a factory of cheesecakes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos,2.64,2.63,2.544,2.2800000000000002,2.6340000000000003

So I stood there waiting for her to get my slice of cheesecake (and keep note it wasn't busy at al) and I looked at her and she literally rolled her eyes and  grunted as if I was bothering her. So I stood there and waited. Then they gave me my cheesecake.  I left home and when I opened up my cheesecake, it was partially smashed. There was nothing on top of it or anything for it to be smashed. So i received it this way. Disappointing.  I'm really disappointed at the customer service at this location.

I ordered the fried fish tacos, my mom ordered the ""Renee's special""(half sandwich, soup and a salad) with the sandwich being chicken salad. Both plates came out about 15 minutes after ordering and were huge portions! The fish was cooked perfectly and the pickled red onions and chipotle crema on them were amazing! My mom got so much food she ended up eating the soup and salad and taking the sandwich home for later. Overall the food was great, the customer service was on point and the restaurant had a very nice atmosphere. Definitely coming back! Gonna try either the shrimp scampi or the bistro shrimp next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos,2.76,2.65,2.572,,2.694
10,Tammy S.,"Long Beach, CA",7,6,1.0,2.0,2017-12-24,"Like other reviewers here, I haven't had a bad experience at this location until today. Just got back from dinner with my daughter and I am so upset to write that our dinner was unpleasant.  We were promptly seated when we arrived..didnt even need to wait given the Christmas holiday. One star.  The host sat us down, gave us our menus. We knew what we wanted so we were ready to order. We waited for our waiter...and waited...and waited some more. No one came to greet us for 15-20 mins. The customers next to our table were seated after us had their waiter at their table within seconds.  Eventually the waiter decided to show up, took our drink order then disappears. He reappeared with bread and one drink..my diet coke.  10 mins later he brought out my daughter's lemonade and took down our food order. Okay so our food came out faster than I thought - two stars.  Throughout the entire night, the waiter never checked in on us again. EVER. I had to flagged down another employee to get his attention when we were ready to leave. Further, they ran out of the original cheesecake. Who the EFF runs out on their signature desert for what they are known for?? Yeah I do sound irked because my daughter's birthday is tomorrow and she didnt get her favorite cheesecake. Guess what? We flagged someone else again to get the waiter to bring back my debit card. SMH. NEVER. AGAIN.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos,2.8,2.66,2.572,,2.716

Just the other night I ordered take out since it was a bit late and I was craving some good pasta.  I was there early to pick up my order and pasta was cold! No silverware! No napkins! I asked for my wings well done and they were pink on the inside. The girl on the phone asked if I wanted bread and butter and of course I said yes. Well guess what hard bread with No butter!  I was so bummed out because I love Cheesecake Factory so much, but I will just blame the location and the staff that worked the later shift! 1 star service....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=20,2.8,2.62,2.556,,2.692

I forgot the hostess name but management needs to give her some new customer service training.  No wonder this place is 2.5 stars. The only thing good about my visit was my server. Forgot his name but he got glasses on and a beard. He deserves a lead position for sure.  Would i come back here again?

19,Mary P.,"Irvine, CA",416,83,296.0,2.0,2018-01-01,"Cheesecake Factory or Yard House has always been my family's go to restaurants when we can't decide what we want to eat. However the more I've been going to Cheesecake factory, the less I want to come back. I've been to this location several times and there's always a long wait time, which is fine. But the service is just getting slower, and slower. When we went last week we waited 50 min to get seated, and then another HOUR to get our food. So we didn't get to eat until about 2 hours into Cheesecake. Our appetizer came 30 minutes after we ordered and was cold...So it's obviously been sitting out in the kitchen. Our waiter was super nice and friendly which I really appreciated and I know he has no control over the food, but it seems like all the waiters were just scrambling everywhere to keep up with their assigned tables and there were 5 million birthday songs being sung left and right lol. I got my food 15 min. after everyone else as well. I ordered fries as a substitute for mashed potatoes with my steak but they gave me the steak first cause they didn't want to keep me waiting any longer and then brought the fries out after. And my plate looked pretty sad there were like 10 green beans hahaha. We had to ask for steak knives after we got our dishes. Overall it was just meh. I understand it's a super busy restaurant but I'm kind of surprised the service just continues to lag and get slower everytime I come back and doesn't really get better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos,2.88,2.65,2.584,,2.742
42,Amy M.,"Lawndale, CA",0,7,,2.0,2018-01-02,"This is by far the absolute worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. I came here December 28, 2017 to celebrate my mother's birthday. The wait time I was given was extremely inaccurate and the hostess seemed not to care about their inconsistency about the wait time they had provided. Once sat, our server was really friendly. She was overwhelmed though, it seemed like she had way too many tables. We understood though she did try her best. The nachos were good, however, the cheese stake sandwich was bland and the Alfredo pasta I had ordered tasted awful. I've ordered Alfredo pasta from other locations and it's been delicious! However at this location flavor was lacking. In all, I won't come back to this location, I much rather drive to Brea or Huntington Beach. As a corporation I hope you guys come back in and fix this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=20,2.88,2.66,2.592,,2.748
114,Mamta M.,"Little Falls, NJ",64,2,,2.0,2018-01-02,I bought a promotional offer that stated when you purchase a $25.00 Gift card you get two slices of cheesecake for free. Nothing was stated that we have to purchase any meals to redeem the free cheesecake. My 8year old handicap daughter was craving cheesecake so I went to redeem the offer and was given a hard time by the employee. She stated that I had purchase a meal before I can claim my free cheesecake. I explained to her that no such information was put on this gift card. And she began to tell me that I can only claim one cheesecake per order per visit. It took her 25 min to get a manger to approve. After having to argue and explain the situation. I am a loyal customer of the Cheesecake Factory because of my 8 yrs old handicapped daughtonly enjoys cheesecake from your restaurant and I felt the service I received was unsatisfactory. After reading the other negative feedbacks it seems to me that you have a standard reply for dissatisfied customers. I am highly disappointed with you run of the mill apology. You just lost a loyal customer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=80,2.76,2.63,2.584,,2.6819999999999995

She went out of her way several times for our family. I would have given them 5 stars just on her service as a waitress alone, but the chicken Madeira was too sweet and the alcohol was not cooked out and the replacement farfalle with chicken and garlic was bland (probably cause they were rushing to replace it).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos?start=20,3.0,2.66,2.592,,2.7960000000000003

39,Jimmy S.,"Cerritos, CA",0,3,,1.0,2018-01-06,They don't take phone reservation on the weekends  so basically you have to go there and wait 1.5 hours.

2,Justin M.,"Yucca Valley, CA",170,4,,1.0,2018-01-07,"Came in for my grandfathers birthday, had a good amount of us and waited almost 2 hours to get seated. This put aside I understand there's no fault on the restaurant being that it's all based off of foot traffic and wait times can always fluctuate.  Finally seated.. entrees roll out of the kitchen and first off the salmon was extremely oily, we also ordered a hamachi steak, which was cold. On top of that we also ordered the cashew chicken and it was drenched in sauce and not only that but the sauce was overcooked/recooked (dark & chunks) there was so much sauce that you couldn't even separate the rice from the chicken it was literally a soup consistency. There were a few other dishes that were also ordered but to save the eyes I'll spare the words. Overall there needs to be some enormous efforts on quality control on the line and maybe some provisions on protocol for entrees leaving the expo.  Asides from entrees, also ran into a huge issue with splitting the bill. It was a party of 10 and we were informed that it was not possible to split it 5 ways which is ridiculous. It literally takes 10 seconds on any POS system to split and itemize separate checks.  The server was a sweetheart and apologetic through all of this I must add.  Definitely not coming back in, this location seems to have many issues on the management spectrum.. all done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cerritos,2.52,2.65,2.576,,2.598
3,Michael L.,"Buena Park, CA",21,93,58.0,1.0,2018-01-07,"Unless it's for cheesecake takeout, I will probably never eat at this place again. You wait for ever, when the entire patio area is open and then once you get seated surrounded by open tables, you get the one that hasn't even been cleaned off yet. The hostess doesn't care, she just walks off. I hand the bill from the previous party that at at our table to a passing waitress and clean the table off. Our waiter comes and first thing he asks for is the bill of the previous party and I tell him I handed it off to a waitress. He looks upset and sternly asked me which one and at that point I let him have it for everthing I had mentioned before. So we order our drinks and because I hate waiting to get a refill, I ask him to bring me two drinks at once. He forgets a drink of someone else at my party but brings my second one. When the food comes, I specifically ask for ranch with my food and guess what, no ranch. At this point I just call it a wash and ask for my bill. I read over it and I get charged for two separate drinks when the one I had was free refills.

I also know that when you make the customer feel bad for asking for something (the little reservation buzzy thingy), that's bad business and not good service. Now that that is out of way: HOLY WOW. The food. AMAZING. The setting: sublime. I felt like it shouldn't be called ""The Cheesecake Factory"" but rather, the ""Divine Food Castle!""

He would come check up on us often but after said he had to leave and left us with another waiter. Which i cant say i was impressed with. She only asked if we were ok once and after never came back. Later, our first waiter came and asked if we wanted refills and fresh bread. Me and my boyfriend both agree he was great. Now, food was good, the dumpling appetizers were very salty but the avocado appetizers were delicious. As for the main meal, (chicken mushroom pasta, and brisket burger i believe.) the portions are quite big for one person. We took both dishes to go and plates were practically full. Had 100 dollar gift card and spent 75 total so i just tipped our first waiter the 25 that was left.

I thought awesome, because I hate mushrooms. I feel sorry for anyone that wanted mushrooms that night, because I got all of them. Whatever easy fix, I shoveled them all onto another plate. I thought the hour wait was bad, the last 30 minutes we waited for our server to come give us our check was worse. Luckily another server named Felipe saw our lost faces and bagged our food and gave us our checks. But oh man that other guy. For the rest of this survey, we'll call him Trashlipe.
