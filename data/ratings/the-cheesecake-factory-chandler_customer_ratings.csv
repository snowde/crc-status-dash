312,Jennifer G.,"Pinal, AZ",73,208,,4.0,2012-01-05,"I will admit it! I have an unhealthy obsession with the Cheesecake Factory. Yes yes, this is a chain, I know. But honestly, I don't give a flying f*** if its a chain or an independent restaurant owned by some cute little family down the road. As long as the food is delicious and plentiful, the service fast and friendly, the cost is palatable,  and the atmosphere clean and pleasant, I will be a fan of any place. After all, isn't that what writing reviews and being a foodie is about? I come to Cheesecake Factory often and I can't think of a time when I had a non pleasant experience. Yes, there have been a couple of waiters that are a bit slower then others and some of the dishes were not as good as others, but I can always say that Cheesecake Fac is a safe bet if you want a nice meal that will fill you up along with decent service.  If you have ever been to the Cheesecake Factory, you know about their menu. It is literally a book! They pride themselves in having something for everyone so there are tons of items to choose from. Here are a few of my suggestions of what to order so you don't go wrong:  Appetizers: - Sweet corn tamale cakes - Fried chicken sliders - Avocado Eggrolls - Fried Zucinni small plate - Their small plates actually have alot. They are like the size of a normal appetizer that is not on steroids - Clam chowder or creamy chicken and artichoke soup - Believe it or not, their clam chowder is the best I have ever had Entrees: - Chicken Costelleta - Chicken Chipotle Pasta - BBQ Ranch chicken salad - Salisbury chopped steak - Crispy spicy beef - Bang bang chicken and shrimp - Only order this if you like Indian spice flavors Keep in mind that everything is massive in size so in my opinion, the prices are pretty decent for the amount of food you get. You could share one entree with another person and get an appetizer and be stuffed yet not spend alot. Now I will admit that there were some things I had at the CC Factory that were not that great. The crabcake burger is too greasy and overpowering, and their mac and cheese balls are nothing impressive. But the good far outweigh the bad and there definitely is something for everyone. Heck, if anything, there is always the cheesecake which they have in every flavor imaginable. Try the dutch apple or carrot, these are my favorites!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chandler?start=300,3.28,3.28,3.28,3.248,3.2800000000000002

258,D D.,"Phoenix, AZ",116,159,20.0,2.0,2012-03-20,"I've got to downgrade my original review after today.  We were seated in the bermuda triangle. We waited 15 minutes for a server to show up, apologize profusely then disappeared for another 15 minutes.  That was the theme for this meal. Sorry for the wait, now wait some more.  Glad they finally got a printed kids menu. Kids pizza was extra greasy, came out 25 minutes before my entree salad. For almost $17 I was hard pressed to find any chicken or bacon in my chopped Cobb salad. Zero blue cheese. I would have told the server but he disappeared until it was time to flag him down for our bill, which took him two passes by our table to drop off.

The Salmon was undercooked, so i asked the server to cook it more.  The manager came back with the dish and told me this is your medium well salmon.

Went last week with the ladies and had the ultimate food envy watching my cohort eat a chicken salad sandwich. Came back this week to test it out and it is the BEST chicken salad sandwich I have ever eaten. May have to add this to my rotation of dining spots.  My other dining mates had  the Shepards Pie, which was delicious and the grilled fish tacos which were also exceptional. I always have a sense of trepidation when I pore over the such an extensive menu. But 3 out of 3 dishes were a winner.

235,John Y.,"Mesa, AZ",67,50,8.0,2.0,2012-06-26,"The Cheesecake Factory in Chandler is one of those restaurants you want to take your family members such as your visiting aunt and uncle from Korea. It would also be a nice place to take your international friends from China or Mexico. That's because the atmosphere and interior is well designed. When I took my mom here yesterday, she was in awe. ""Wow, this place looks great!"" That's all that the Cheesecake Factory offers. The waiter brought us two empty plates. The dishwasher didn't clean it correctly, so he exchanged it for new ones right away. The food is not great. That's why you shouldn't bring your spouse here for an anniversary or have a first date here. My mom ordered a pasta and we both agreed that it tasted bland.  Finally, we shared a slice of cheesecake and my mom ordered a coffee. The slice of cheesecake was good, but it's not worth the money. The lunch+dessert+coffee+tip was around $34 that day. The place has a great atmosphere, but the food isn't worth anywhere near $34.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chandler?start=220,3.28,3.28,3.28,3.1120000000000005,3.2800000000000002

What I wasn't impressed with was their herb-crusted salmon salad.  Maybe it was the word 'crusted' that got me, but I was assuming the fish was going to be served warm.  Surprise!  It was cold.  I choked down as much as I could, but will be going to Pita Jungle and Keegan's for my salmon salads from now on. And I cant say enough about their pina colada cake cheesecake.  A true taste of the islands, part cake, part cheesecake, all yummy.  The only things missing were the fire dancers and hula girls.

I am a fan of their Veggie burger and Evelyn's Favorite Pasta. The complimentary bread is amongst the best too, definitely beats Olive garden, especially the brown one. I've tried only one of their chocolate Cheesecakes and I liked when when I began eating but it was too big for me to enjoy till the end. It would be a good idea to split a slice amongst two people.

When we arrived, there was no wait to be seated but we did have to wait about five minutes before being approached by a waiter. We ordered our beverages and when she came back we ordered an appetizer to share (the crab cakes). When the came out, the looked delicious but I cannot say that they tasted the same. I know that the seafood in the desert is not nearly as fresh or delicious as if you are closer to the shore, but I've still had decent seafood here in AZ and this is not it. Then we ordered our entrees but for some reason ended up waiting a very long time for the food to come out. from the time we sat down until the time our food came out, it had been 45 minutes! What?!?! Come on, I mean there is no excuse for that, is there? And when the food did arrive, her sandwich was kind of a mess and my food was kind of bland.

The service was amazing, the manager even came over at one point and told us not to worry our food was on its way (while my boyfriend and I didn't even think it had been a long time.) The food was just okay. We got calamari as an appetizer, it was good, but just a little to chewy. My pasta was bland..and for $16 dollars I've had way better pasta. My boyfriend got a hamburger and he asked for it to be cooked medium rare and it came out well done. While this dinner experience was just meh I've had a lot better food from here..so all hope isn't lost!

Meanwhile, the hostess is on her phone checking something. When the manager walks by, she puts it away and reorganizes the menus on her table. When the manager walks past her to the bar, she sees me again and asks me if I am ready to be seated now. Why couldn't I have been seated before?

Indifferent servers who really seem to think they have something better they could be doing. The food though, always great. This is probably my favorite chain restaurant.

Did the cook put the entire jar of hoisin sauce in this dish, and not other spice? The sauce and the chicken did not go together at all.  My wife had the chicken mushroom lettuce wrap.  It was OK at best. We ended the meal with the warm apple crisp with ice cream. It was way too sweet; spoon for spoon, pure sugar would be less sweet. Only the vanilla ice cream and whipped cream were any good.

I have come to the conclusion that the Cheesecake Factory needs to find out what they want to be. Do you want to be a Mexican restaurant? A steakhouse? An American grill? Clearly this mix match of food and seven menu pages worth of choices has worked for them for a long time but my belief is that you can't do something great if you try to do 100 things at one time. Too many menu items! While variety is nice, the menu is overwhelming and the chef's have way too much room for error. My food has always been just okay here but it is clear to me why. I do love the cheesecake. It is my favorite dessert so that is of course ultimately why I come here. I generally decide to make a meal of it when I do come here and often just wonder why I didn't just go to The Keg across the street. Why have a mediocre steak when you could have an amazing one?

I am not much of a cheesecake aficionado, and they have always struck me as an icon of american food excess.  The few times we've eaten in one, we have always left with a bagful of leftovers capable of feeding a third world family for a week.  A slight exaggeration, but not by much I believe. On the positive side, Cheesecake Factory makes some really interesting and tasty dishes.  I have also found that I have become susceptible to subliminal messages while watching Sheldon and Leonard discuss their BBQ Burger on Big Bang Theory. LOL So here I was shopping at the Mall and wondering about lunch, when I walked passed Cheesecake Factory and thought of Sheldon and Leonard's discourse.  See link:  So instead of their preferred BBQ Burger, I went with the Classic Burger for $10.50 (see photos). Wow it was huge (maybe a 1/2 lb.) and very, very good.  A couple months back we were in LVS and had an enjoyable dinner at Gordon Ramsey's ""BurGR"". This burger is a close second to that carnivorous experience. I'll say it again, wow.  Cheesecake's Classic Burger is grilled on an open flame and it picks up all that smokey taste from the grill. A nice touch was the sliced grilled red onion which is served on top.  Absolutely Four Star Plus experience; and yes I am a Fan. Maybe next time I'll try Sheldon's BBQ Burger.

We didn't have to wait to be seated which is really surprising since this place is always packed. The hostess showed us to our table, and as we were sitting down, a waitress very rudely came to the table and told the hostess that someone was already sitting there. The hostess said it was okay to sit there anyway, so my boyfriend and I started looking at the menu. The waitress who said that someone was already sitting there was literally giving us the evil eye. The hostess came back a few minutes later and asked us if we would mind moving to another booth because there were other people who were waiting for that booth first. If that was the only problem we had, I wouldn't be writing this review, but it got worse from there.  Our waitress was very nice and pleasant, and she in no way contributed to our horrible experience. We ordered our food at 6:45pm. I ordered the chicken maderia and my boyfriend ordered the Moroccan chicken. We waited and waited for our food, and at 7:15 a manager came to our table and said that an ""overwhelming amount of people ordered pasta"" and because the Moroccan chicken came with kous kous, our food would be delayed. She said something like 300 people ordered pasta and the kitchen couldn't keep up. I've never heard of this happening before. She said it would be a little longer until we got our food, but it ended up being another half an hour before our food came. I'm sorry, but waiting an hour for 2 meals is not acceptable.

I've come to learn to not be too adventurous with the menu - they have some really good options & some not too great choices so I'm starting to stick to the meals I know I like. As far as drinks go, the Tropical Martini, Georgia Peach, & Prickly Pear Margarita are a few of my favorites. For the main dishes, I really like the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp, Pasta DaVinci, and the Santa Fe Salad. I'd say that this is a restaurant that's somewhat overpriced but the quantities but the quantities are really large. I'd prefer it if you could order their main dishes in half sizes at a lowered price. The Godiva cheesecake, Vanilla Bean cheesecake, & Fresh Banana Cream cheesecake are also worth trying.

236,levi a.,"Mesa, AZ",3,21,7.0,5.0,2014-05-18,"Im honestly surprised to see even a single bad review for this restaurant. I was super impressed with the overall operation of this place.  This is my first visit to any cheesecake factory, and it was an excellent experience. I feel i should mention, i was there to have dinner with my wife and daughter, and i had no time restrictions. I wasnt in a hurry. I wasnt looking at the clock. I also wasnt worried about the cost. It seems petty, to me,to worry about dollars and cents when spending time with people you like. So my experience is based solely on what happened, and no outlying factors. We were seated promptly, and greeted by a friendly, nice looking server( i wanna say her name was rachel?, but like i said, i was here for family time) all of the staff appear clean, in clean uniforms, and nice looking. Drink orders, warm bread , blah, blah ,blah. Waitress was super patient when we werent ready to order, she seemed relaxed, and not at all hurried, even though the dining room is ENORMOUS. So we ordered. shrimp with angel hair and asparagus for me, chicken somethin for my wife, and plain burger for my kid. It was all good. Asparagus was perfectly cooked, uniform in color, crisp, but chewable. Pasta was 'al dente', which is exeptionally difficult to acheive in a commercial restaurant.  Now, i honestly couldnt tell you how long the food took, or how long we were there, or what the servers attitude was like, because I WASNT LOOKING for those things. In my opinion, if your in a hurry, or concerned with your funds, maybe a table service restaurant isnt your best choice. In conclussion: As a professional in the restaurant industry myself, i was extremely pleased with my experience here, and i will go so far as to say, ""cheesecake factory is pulling it off"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chandler?start=220,2.92,3.34,3.34,2.9960000000000004,3.172

The portions are huge, and the service is *usually* decent. We went last night (Tuesday) after a rough day, neither my husband or I felt like cooking. Figuring this was our best option since it would have something for everyone, we went late hoping we'd miss any crowds. But its a Tuesday night in late May, why on earth where there be a wait? Sure enough, we got there and it was a 5 minute wait. No big deal, even though we waited more like 10-15 minutes...and that is no fun with a hungry 4 year old, when its after 8pm. Probably our mistake as parents thinking we would get a quick meal, and be in and out.  We were seated and it took another 10 minutes for someone to come get our drink order. Our waiter did apologize for the wait but it was a very half-assed apology. Either be sincere or don't bother mentioning it. We also ordered our food since we had time to look over the menu. Drinks were slow getting out, another 10 minutes. Food was also slow getting out. We were probably here 40 minutes before we got our food. It was busy, but not that busy.  Our waiter was nice but did not ask me once if I needed a refill on my drink, my glass was clearly empty. He did offer my husband another beer though and promptly brought that out.  The service here just sucked, and its gotten worse every time we've come. I know losing us as customers won't make or break you, but we really are done with this location.

Pot stickers as usual for an app and jen order the Ahi Tuna Roll. Be forewarned its fried so the meat is cooked. It's was ok.  Can't not order my chicken Madeira and luckily enough they have a combo with it so I could also try the Steak Diane. I'm temporarily against trying new food items after a bad bad experience at one of my favorite places to eat when I tried something new. Jen ordered a combo too with the Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon. Diane was a little so bland for me but I ate some and Jen's cat will be in heaven with the rest. The chicken barely hit the table and it was gone. Yummy!  Jen said hers was good. Her salmon was a little overcooked but that she would get it again because the lemon sauce was really really good.  I am full so it's going to be blueberry cheesecake to go. I want to finish by saying our server was awesome. Timing was perfect for delivery on food and drinks, and thus the five stars.

138,Valerie M.,"Chandler, AZ",103,412,2560.0,4.0,2014-08-01,"I was lured in by the National Cheesecake Day deal of half price cheesecake.  How can you go wrong with a deal? Service at the bar was okay but kinda slow because they had to get the salt for my Margarita and that took longer than it should've.  There were vacant seats at the bar and a couple took a pair of seats to my left and the gentleman waited until I got my drink so he wouldn't crowd me.  Another lady swooped in and was rude, bumping and crowding me unapologetically so she could have the vacant seat I opted to not be sitting in while I got my order. I was very glad to get away from that scene. The hostesses got us a table in just over five minutes and seated us promptly.  There was a lot of activity there on this particular day because everyone realized at the last minute that today was the last day for half price cheesecake.   Our waitress was sweet and kinda adorable too with her positive approach, bringing me water without asking, and helping to select menu options for hubby and myself.  I couldn't decide on dinner and asked for her to give me a recommendation.   I went with a salad, I think it was their version of an Asian salad but truly I just can't remember.  I had asked if there was a salad with strawberries and chicken and what she suggested is the one I had, but she got the kitchen to add strawberries so it was more to my liking.  Excellent. And hubbies pasta was served up as he had requested too.  Very nice. French fries that were supposed to be part of my sons meal were overlooked and didn't make it to the table until he was almost done with his sandwich. And the manager actually stopped by to apologize for the French fry oversight too. Here we were enjoying each others company and the food, discussing the day and such -not at all in a fuss about the overlooked FF, so it was a surprise to have him check in on us. It seems the spicy chicken sandwich he ordered was not what he had hoped for because it didn't have enough spice to really qualify as ""spicy"", but otherwise he said it was good. Now the cheesecakes, omg, there are so many options it's difficult to decide. I went with my first impression and got the Mango and Key Lime.  Not being a fan of Key Lime pie I wasn't so thrilled with that part but thought the Mango might make the Key Lime a nice blend.  Eh, not the case.  I felt I was eating a Key Lime with Mango cheesecake. Still good and after a couple bites with some coffee I decided I should have the rest packed up and it was time to go. Prompt seating even through there was a huge crowd. Really good service, but the times I've been here before I guess this is standard and to be expected.

The server confirmed the no-pickle request, but surprise, surprise the burger was covered in pickle slices when it was delivered to the table. I CAN'T STAND THE TASTE and SMELL of them. They offered to take the burger back and remove the pickles. I ended up removing them myself, and cutting off part of the burger patty touched by the pickles. Having to reorder the food would have taken another 30 minutes I didn't have time for today. The waitress who took the order never apologized or acknowledged the issue. The sweet potato fries were as good as you expect, few people really know how to do them right anyway. They were undercooked inside and didn't have a hint of crunchiness on the outside. The four-cheese pasta was well received by my lunch mate. Order off the menu as is and you'll get the formulaic food, but don't order anything with a slight modification.

This past visit was probably one of the worst. Ok, maybe it was the worst. I ordered the Chicken Chipotle Pasta. $16.95. This is one of my favs but this time the chicken was a bit over cooked. I'm not a fan of dry chicken. The rest of the dish was ok. K ordered the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp. $17.95. She had to ask for additional sauce because it came out with very little sauce. At least they didn't charge us for it. The sauce was good. The rice was a bit on the undercooked side. The chicken was fine. C ordered the Buffalo Strips $9.99. $10.99 with fries. This is a great deal. 8 large breaded chicken tenders for $9.99. An extra buck for fries. Heck of a deal. Grandma C ordered the Carolina BBQ sandwich. $12.95. She didn't eat it because it was chunked pork, not pulled. Now the bad stuff; First off, charging $4.50 for a Strawberry lemonade for my son is RIDICULOUS. Second, I think $7.50, $7.95 for a slice of cheesecake is too much. Especially when the whole cheesecake is around $50. And lastly, the Carolina BBQ sandwich is described as being made with pulled pork. It is not. It is made with pork chunks. Not very good for a sandwich. We told the manager we were not pleased with the sandwich but in the middle of our debate on the merits of pulled pork vs pork chunks the fire alarm went off. FOR 10+ MINUTES. (We learned from a server that the key needed to turn off the alarm was taken home by one of the new managers. So the fire dept was on it's way to turn off the alarm) I think a good portion of the guests left after a few minutes because the ear piercing blaring noise of the fire alarm was a bit much to take. We stayed. I was hoping to finish our conversation with the manager but he never returned. We also had hoped that the pork sandwich would be taken off the bill. It wasn't. And we hoped that the Mgr would buy a slice of cheesecake to make up for the sandwich. He didn't. We sat through that blaring alarm for nothing except for an ""I can't believe you stayed"" from our server. You know what? I can't believe we stayed either.

I mentioned it to the server, who then replaced it with a crab dish which came burned to a crisp. Charcoal black, you couldn't even taste the crab. Then came dessert. I can't eat bread, so I asked the server to recommend a cheesecake which might have a little less of it. He brought a lemon raspberry cheesecake, which looked delicious, but had bread underneath the cheesecake, which again, I cannot digest. There was so little raspberry sauce, they should have just called it lemon cheesecake. I mentioned it to the server, who agreed with me, stating that wasn't the portion it should come with. I asked for more of the sauce, he disappeared, then came back and told me I'd be charged extra for it.

Kale is involved, and when Kale shows up, you know healthy is about to throw down. The options included a lot of sandwiches, which didn't work for my carb-averse diet, so I requested the most obnoxious thing on the planet: a lettuce-wrapped sandwich with a side salad. They served it, and it was what health nuts would describe as ""delicious"". I am working my way there, so as of now I can affirm that it was ""food"".

I came here with the party of about 15 a few nights ago and was thoroughly impressed with how accommodating they were to our needs. They were quick to seat us, bring us waters and provide us with bread while we waited for the entire party to arrive. They checked back frequently for all of us to arrive and was ready and waiting to take our order when we were all present. Also, they had no problem initially separating our checks during ordering so we wouldn't have to worry about splitting the check later on. Which was GREATLY appreciated and made checking out that much easier. Now, everyone knows how overwhelming Cheesecake's book of a menu is. I didn't mind waiting for our late friends because it takes that long to decide what to order. They also have a separate ""SKINNYLICIOUS"" menu that I've never seen before! This is news to me. We are usually pretty healthy eaters but this particular night was a ""cheat"" day for us. We ordered off the regular menu: fried avocado, zucchini, and portobello mushroom starter and the avocado egg roll appetizer. They were both great. In attempt to be somewhat healthy, I ordered the almond crusted salmon kale salad on the regular menu and this dish is not good at all. I gave it a chance and took a few bites hoping that the salmon flavor would kick in or the dressing would save it but I didn't taste anything. It was very bland. I had to ask the waiter to take it back because I didn't even want to take it home. I hate doing that and wasting food but I had to and he was so nice to take it off our bill. Thank you so much, I really appreciated it. Thank goodness my fiancé ordered the salmon and steak plate because it was enough for both of us to share and the flavor profile of this dish was wonderful. The steak flavor reminded me of adobo and the salmon was cooked to perfection. I had no more room for dessert which was a bummer because I love almost every dessert I've ever tried here. But I did have the privilege of trying my friends lemon cake/strawberry cheesecake and it was SO GOOD. I will need to get it the next time I go in.

This was our first time at this location, and we LOVED it!!!! We went for lunch, and were seated straight away. We loved everything from the food to the service! Our waiter, Tom, was awesome! Super cool, chill dude. I love when waiters are just themselves around you, no weird vibes like they're trying to play it cool or be fancy. So ask for Tom! For the food, I have Celiacs, so I had to get GF. But man that was probably the best tasting gluten free meal I think I've ever had at a restaurant! We got the farfalle with roasted garlic, I think? And it was just amazing! You couldn't even tell it was GF! I can't express how AMAZING that was. And Tom even said that most of their pasta dishes (and burgers) can be made gluten free. Uh major bonus! And of course I got the chocolate Godiva cheesecake (cause it's the only GF option). But man it was wonderful! Very rich though, so you gotta love that intense chocolate taste!

I told them I would be there at 530 and they said they would have the cake ready for me at that time.  I called right before I arrived and I was told they will send somebody out immediately. 5 minutes later a customer arrives and within a minute, the attendant comes out and serves them. I immediately talk to that attendant and he says they will be right with me. Ten minutes pass and I give them a call again and they said they didn't know I was out there waiting. Fifteen minutes now and another customer pulls up behind me and is served. The waitress had no idea I was there again. When I asked for the manager the manager came out and said there was nothing he would do to compensate me for my time. He said that it is my fault for not letting them know I was outside despite the fact that I called twice and talked to two attendants about having waited for someone to help. I understand that mistakes happen in the service industry but to come out after 15 minutes of waiting and two different customers being served before me and have the manager tell me that I was at fault was not worth an overpriced 60 dollar cheesecake. On top of that, the cheesecake was still frozen an hour and half after I picked it up even though they told me they had left it to thaw two hours before I got there!

Tonight the chicken was terrible so over cooked it was like eating turkey jerky. Almost no sauce so we sent it back . Second time it was worse so we ordered something different. Came out great but the mashed potatoes ice cold not warm at all. This is a sign of a major problem in my opinion. Honestly I have eaten here at least two dozen times.  More than half the time the food is not right. Proof is the fact that they have only three stars. Guess I'm not the only one.

77,PrincessCandyEmpire S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",4668,101,3222.0,5.0,2015-12-25,"THIS REVIEW IS STRICTLY MY OPINION FROM MY EXPERIENCE: I'm not a huge fan of reviewing store chains, especially restaurant chains.  When I'm writing a review, I want to make sure I am adding something unique, that perhaps someone didn't already know. Since chains are everywhere, everyone has already tried them so chain reviews usually basically come down to rehashing information we all already know or become a report card on what we thought of the service. It's easy to look down on chains or take them for granted because they're probably run by a giant faceless corporation or some big fat cat.  One of the notable exceptions is The Cheesecake Factory.  The Cheesecake Factory started in 1978 from an idea that a son of a baker couple had to showcase his mother's cheesecakes, as well as to add a restaurant. The Cheesecake Factory has a certain je ne sais quoi quality and is impressively successful operating on such a grand scale.  What do I mean? The decor.  The Cheesecake Factory is stunning and huge. There is the main dinning room, the bar and bakery areas. Each could conceivably operate on their own. The high ceilings with all the art work is pretty amazing. The craftsmanship of the bar is gorgeous. The whole restaurant is very well appointed. (see pics) The menu.  The Cheesecake Factory menu is massive. Not just in the quantity of items, but the scope as well.  The menu features: Appetizers/Small Plates/Snacks Salads Pizza  Glamburgers/Sandwiches Pastas Steaks/Chops/Fish/Seafood Eggs/Omelettes There are 2 new sections: ""Super"" Foods & Skinnylicious ""Super"" Foods are nutrient rich special recipes with high sources of antioxidants.  Some of these include: Falafel Salad Super Antioxidant Salad Vegan Cobb Salad Kale & Quinoa Salad Skinnylicious are a collection of fresh & delicious menu options all at 590 calories or less.  Obviously, desserts include cheesecake.  Like ALL the cheesecakes ever invented! Drink menu is extensive & creative.  The Service.  The Cheesecake Factory has a pretty consistent high level of service. Occasionally, there is a surly server, but it is rare.  The Hours: 11am - 12am Extras: Catering Gift Cards Ship A Cheesecake Now think of all of those things I listed and multiply by 5 Phoenix Valley locations.  (Chandler, Mesa, Biltmore, Kierland, & Peoria) To have 5 massive restaurants all in the same city (over 200 locations total) and to be as successful as they are, for as long as they have been, is impressive and rare.  The ability to just stop in to an epic environment with constantly high level & varied products and excellent service is beyond impressive, which unfortunately can be taken for granted.  For more information: I 5/5 highly recommend The Cheesecake Factory!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chandler?start=60,3.04,3.09,3.09,2.9960000000000004,3.07

Yeah that's pretty much the whole reason I love this place.  Between friends and family, I've seen and tried a huge amount but my go-to is a dinner-sized appetizer with a few substitutions. It's called the Thai Lettuce Wraps. I substitute the noodles with avocado and the chicken with salmon. It's super healthy, the dips are to die for, and lasts me at least two meals. Some of my other favorites, and slightly less healthy options, include the Mac And Cheese burger and Chicken Bellagio (ask for extra sauce). You really can't go wrong with those. My mom swears by the kale quinoa salad and proclaims it's the best kale she's ever had.  Okay as for the cheesecakes, the Salted Caramel Cheesecake is my newest favorite- replacing my previous favorite of Ultimate Red Velvet. It was seasonal this fall (2015) and became a part of the menu due to popular demand. I'm SO glad. I absolutely love cheesecake and have one each time I go. Other favorites include the White Chocolate and Reece's Peanut Butter Cup.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chandler?start=100,3.32,3.19,3.19,2.6399999999999997,3.242

This seat was particularly obnoxious as we were right next to the server order station and numerous servers ""hung out"" there to chat with each other and put in orders. Since there is no boundary between the server station and the seat, it's like a group standing over you and looking at you from your left side, squelching any chance at a private conversation with your dining companion.

They were delicious, at the Scottsdale chain(previously went and had the sampler).  The ham and Swiss is perfectly melted onto the wrap to make it melt in your mouth. The mustard sauce is the proverbial cherry on top. 4.5 stars.  For dessert I got the chocolate mousse cheesecake. One word, delicious. It is one of the best cakes I've had here. The presentation of it makes it look like a 5 star restaurant, taste included. Biting in, the vanilla mascarpone is the first thing that hits the taste buds. It is creamy and rich yet not overwhelming. Next, getting into the chocolate. The mousse was delicious and not too overwhelming. Overall the flavors blend together to create a perfect dessert. 5 stars.  My only trouble here was the service. If I didn't say when, then why did you stop with the mozzarella?

My friend said he would take the Whataburger burger over the burger he ordered at the Cheesecake Factory. 2 star burger  The only thing that tasted for what we paid for was the filet mignon. 4 star filet  We also had eggplants which were really good and they came with a side dish of pasta with pesto which was completely tasteless. Probably the worst pasta I have ever tried anywhere. It was almost like eating pasta with water. The manager came over replacing the pasta with a pasta Alfredo which was excellent. 3 star eggplant Our server was very young and very tall, he said he turned 21 just 2 weeks ago.

So it's a little bit but it miss with how good your food was. Except for the burger.  I would say let the Cheesecake Factory keep on making cheese cakes and not full restaurant menus.

Twenty something minutes later, my plantains came. Everyone else had already eaten. My food was then cold.  I know it wasn't my waiter's fault, but my food did not come out as it was supposed to.

While there we are repeatedly splashed w/water and as the AZ sun starts to go down BLINDED by it.  DO NOT SIT OUTSIDE the planning was unthoughtful to the diner. 2.  After we order pasta carbonara and grilled shrimp salad we wait for over 45 min.  On top of that the waitress was stingy w/bread (c'mon we were hungry) and gave us no communication about our food.  Meanwhile 6 people have sat after us, received their food and 3 left.  We ask and are told it will be out soon, NO Apologioes 3.  Food arrives...My shrimp are cold, my lettuce is wilted  and the pasta has lil sauce (my hubby always orders the same thing and this was mediocre) and is coagulated.   We ask for a manager he reluctantly apologizes and after I say I'm not paying offers to take the food off the bill, which I felt no guilt for because we didn't eat it at all.......

159,Britty C.,"Tempe, AZ",1,12,2.0,1.0,2016-08-20,"I hate that I am writing a horrible review about Cheesecake Factory as it is one of my favorite restaurants. I have worked in the food and beverage industry for about ten years so I like to think I am very reasonable when it comes to my expectations as well as being understanding that things will- and do go wrong daily in this business. My last experience at The Cheesecake Factory was unacceptable. I have never felt the need to write a bad review after a bad experience but I feel compelled to address this particular situation in hopes that it will never happen to myself or any other customer again. My boyfriend and I frequent this restaurant as it is one of our favorite places to dine and while out for my birthday a couple weekends ago a series of unfortunate events occurred making it hard to want to ever come back. From the beginning our server seemed like he was in the weeds and struggling to keep up, I could tell because another server asked if he needed help and he was frantic while talking to us and the tables around. Like I mentioned before I have worked in this industry and have served many years so this particular part didn't bother me as much, but maybe he should have more training or an easier section on a Saturday night for the sake of the customers. Where it starts to get messy is after we ordered. I had ordered the four cheese pasta and my boyfriend had ordered the Filet Mignon. I am not sure if things were sent to the kitchen at different times or if there was a mistake in the kitchen because my pasta had been delivered to the table a minimum of 20 minutes before the steak got to the table. I had completely finished my meal (with some help from my boyfriend since he was starving) and was done before a steak came to the table. While very understanding that things happen in restaurants I am baffled by the fact that nobody communicated with us on what had happened. Our server was blatantly ignoring us, avoiding eye contact and didn't explain anything. The whole time this was happening our drinks were empty, never being filled. Finally he came to the table and when my boyfriend had mentioned it was unacceptable all he said was that he was going to send someone over to talk to us, still no explanation on what had happened. A steak finally arrived at our table and he started eating when another worker approached us and said he had received the wrong steak. Not really a problem because it was switched out fairly quick, but still another mistake made by our server. My boyfriend had finished majority of his steak dinner and was done eating so we flagged our waiter and asked for a check. Still a manager hadn't come over to our table and we were completely done eating. At the time we asked for our check I ordered a piece of cheesecake to go. Finally a manager came to the table and said he heard there was a timing issue. While I hate creating a scene and ruin other peoples dining experience I didn't say much other then I had been completely done eating before his  food came out. The manager asked if we were getting dessert and I mentioned I had already placed the order. Still we had no explanation of what happened and the managers visit was very short. We were STILL waiting on our check and I could tell that the communication between the manager and our server was very poor. Our server came back still with no check and asked if we wanted the cheesecake to go or for here. I had ordered the cheesecake to go long before the manager came over so I was confused as to why he came back to ask that and it was clear he still hadn't sent the order through. So on top of waiting a unreasonable amount of time on food we spent an even more amount of time just trying to get our check and cheesecake to go and leave the restaurant. In the future I hope the employees at this location communicate appropriately with each other and the guests to avoid situations like these.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chandler?start=140,2.72,3.05,3.05,2.6920000000000006,2.9179999999999997
126,Mary H.,"Mesa, AZ",0,59,9.0,3.0,2016-08-20,"Everything started off very good. Greeted quickly by the female bartender working, and drinks and food were served in a timely manner.  We ordered Thai lettuce wraps and fire roasted artichoke, and both were amazing. Couldn't of been happier with our decisions.  What bothered me was not being offered another drink well after I was done with my first and about to take my last bite of dinner, so I wasn't really in the mood to order another one anymore. Next, I looked at my bill and was charged for the more expensive of the two wines when I had asked just for the house wine which would be the cheapest of the two at most places, so I was kind of disappointed that she decided to just give and charge me what she wanted. It was only $2 more and the wine was actually very good, so I didn't mention it since I had finished the wine, if I had ordered another, maybe I would have brought it up.  Female bartender leaves and now left with the male who was working the well the majority of the time we were there. He's very nice and checks to see if we want dessert. I tell him I'm going to look, and decide to just order espressos for my fiancé and myself. Five minutes go by after ordering and I excuse myself to the bathroom. I come back and still no espressos, and he says they are being checked on... Now well over 15 minutes, he says they are being checked on.. Comes back to tell us they aren't ready... 25 minutes go by.... Tells us again they aren't ready but ensures us that they are coming. I'm over the espressos. I ask him to cancel and rering my card without them. I go outside and 5 minutes later my fiancé tells me they are there. I appreciate getting them being taken off but I honestly didn't want them anymore and they were not very hot, and not offered any sugar or spoon for the drinks. It wasn't the bartenders fault but just disappointed in 30 minute espressos... And pretty upset that it took longer to get the espressos than the time it took to order and eat our dinner... My fiancé said the manager came over and apologized for the espresso while I was outside, and had removed them from our bill, but didn't seem to want to make up for taking so long on what should of been a quick after dinner drink..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chandler?start=120,2.64,3.07,3.07,2.8920000000000003,2.8979999999999997

She forgot about our previously ordered cheesecake and when she finally brought it, we had been waiting 20 min at this point. Not everybody that goes out to eat wants to be there for over 2 hours.

She never refilled our drinks. The actual cheesecake I ate at home, ""chocolate chip cookie dough"" was tasteless and dry. Maybe I should have given 1 star but I do love the Asian chicken salad and my husband enjoyed his filet mignon. Eating out shouldn't be such a pain. The acoustics are also bad.

The portion sizes are also ridiculously large and food too unhealthy. I avoided this place for years until the last year when someone really wanted to go here, and I forced myself to go. When I showed up, I was pleasantly surprised by their Skinnylicious menu which has options 590 calories or less. It's a sizable and diverse menu. That immediately won me over. Of course the other large portions/unhealthy options are still there, but I can appreciate the increased sensitivity to a nutrition-conscious customer. Flash forward another few months, Cheesecake Factory started including calorie information on their menu. Another added bonus. I know nutrition in America is heading in this direction but nevertheless, I am still impressed. They offer bread as an appetizer that always arrives at the table warm! Menu options are bountiful and food types vary greatly. Everything usually tastes good. Their cheesecake is AMAZING! But, it's extremely sugary and fatty so beware. Specifically for this location, they always seem to have good customer service, one of their redeeming factors. Their wait staff is extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and professional. They're always quick no matter how busy they are. The hostesses are always nice, despite the chaos of large crowds. There is usually a wait varying from 5-90 minutes during busy hours. I went there today and the wait was maybe 5 minutes. When my name was called, I started walking up but saw someone else walk up to the hostess desk and claim herself as Sylvia.

It tasted fine once it thawed, but I can buy a much better cheesecake from Costco that is twice as big for half the price. $30 for a frozen 7"" cheesecake was definitely not worth it, especially since the convenience factor was eliminated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chandler?start=60,2.52,2.85,2.932,,2.718

My fiancé and I sat at the bar and the bartender took a long time to greet us, then we had to call her back over to order. I ordered my drink, she went and got it, then never even asked my fiancé what he would like.

The food is okay, kind of bland and don't even get me started and the bible that is the menu. How is anyone supposed to choose a dish when they're not entirely sure how long it will take to read it?

15,Chasity R.,"Chandler, AZ",3,9,1.0,1.0,2017-11-26,"My boyfriend & I visited this CF last night and are iffy about returning. The wait wasn't bad at all, maybe ten minutes tops. After being seated we were provided the complimentary bread & water. We both opted to trying a mixed drink off the menu: Whiskey Smash & the Ultimate Margarita. The Smash wasn't terrible, had decent flavor but did taste a little watered down after a few sips. The Margarita, however, was terrible- tasted purely of margarita mix & nothing else; pretty much had to force it down- no sense in wasting a $10 drink. We also ordered the Corn Tamale Cakes as an appetizer. These were kinda weird; flavor was more sweet than anything. There are 3 cakes to a plate, I barely finished one and we didn't even touch the third. Our visit thus far was mediocre, but we decided to still order entrees. I ordered the Shrimp & Chicken  Gumbo which was no gumbo at all. I grew up eating gumbo & have always known it to have a broth to make it almost like a soup; this was just gloopy and mush. There was absolutely no flavor, the shrimp was overcooked & extremely chewy and the rice was still hard. I took a few bites and couldn't force anymore down. It was gross.  My boyfriend ordered the Shrimp with Angel Hair. The description talks about all this lemon, garlic flavor with some marinara sauce. This ""meal"" had absolutely no flavoring. It seemed like they made the pasta, threw a hefty helping of bruschetta tomatoes on top and threw on 5 pieces of overcooked shrimp to it & charged us $17.95. There was no sauce, no lemon/herb flavor. My boyfriend took 2 bites and pushed it to the side. It was terrible.  We immediately asked for our check & our server didn't even ask if everything was alright or if there was anything she could do. Nope, she just dropped our check off and that was that, even after seeing the full plates of food still. An $89 meal that was beyond basic and left us both feeling disappointed, frustrated and hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chandler,2.64,2.86,2.928,,2.7720000000000002

Amazing server Drew was very upbeat and sweet, kept up with all of our drinks and was able to get all meals right. Once meals were tasted is where things went south. The pasta was awful and tasted like buttery noodles. No seasoning was on them or garlic flavor whatsoever. Some of us had this issue (4) of us out of the large party. We weren't going to complain because we have all worked service and it was not the waiters fault. But once something was said an incompetent old woman came to the table to let us know it was suppose to taste like butter. Which we all have had this dish before we are not children yet she only conversated for a moment never acknowledging that there was something wrong with the dish only trying to convince us that it's suppose to taste awful like that.

We were seated promptly and our server, Brooks, was great. Two of us were happy with the food, the lunch salmon and the orange chicken. My double bacon burger was excellent. My wife can not eat black pepper. In spite of the huge menu she could not find anything she could eat so she got breakfast food. Even with that, the fried potatoes had black pepper on them, they were supposed to have been made plain.

And then the rice was stale it was not soft and fluffy the way it is suppose to be made. At that point I was already starving from waiting for so long and couldn't wait any longer because my friends dishes had no issues.On top of everything the manager did not care she said I'll se what's going on with the kitchen ? What does that even mean. How are you not concerned for the pain I just endured because of your staff didnt even have the decency to apologize.

2,Bill C.,"Chandler, AZ",169,99,55.0,3.0,2018-01-04,"I've been here numerous times. It's a fantastic place if you need a good variety menu. They literally have everything as far as type of food goes. I couldn't imagine them not having something for a very picky person. This place is busy, and for good reason I'm sure. Customer service is good about 60% of the time. I think it really depends on who you luck out with. Or perhaps I may have just gotten a new trainee a couple of times. Long story short, we've been admittedly forgotten about at our table on 2 different occasions. I thought this was kind of odd. Took about 1 hour and 45 minutes from sitting down to finishing our food. Clearly this is uncommon and a mistake. Mistakes happen, I get it. This is unfortunately why I can't give this place a higher rating just yet.  Cheesecake is of course wonderful, along with the rest of their menu. I haven't tried any drinks, but they also have a plentiful amount of what to choose from.  Its in a great location, right by the mall. This could also be why its very busy at around Dinner times. Its close to me, so I'm sure I'll be back in the near future to try and get this to a higher rating! :) Food quality 4/5 Customer service 3/5 Restaurant cleanliness 5/5 Value 3/5",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chandler,2.88,2.8,2.944,,2.832

I got the truffle-honey chicken with mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was delicious! I recommend it. They also have a wide variety of cheese cake to pick from (over 20 types). I got the Chris's outrageous cake which is chocolate coconut cheesecake. It was rich and sweet... really hit the spot! The wait time was longer then expected but it was a Friday after noon which is typical. The service was speedy and our waitress was great.

Called again. They said they would bring it out. 30 minutes go by. Nothing. Literally nothing. So I just left.  THANKS FOR WASTING AN HOUR OF MY LIFE CHEESECAKE FACTORY. You suck.

Our other waiter, Corey, did a phenomenal job of helping us with our dessert options (he made a plan with my husband to surprise me! How cute!!!!). His charisma, patience, and welcoming vibe made all the difference in our experience. Not only do I highly recommend this Cheesecake location, but I highly recommend Corey as a server.

We had FABULOUS FUN! We got the new Specialty#Chicken Riesling which was an explosion of flavor in every bite! It's chicken with bacon, mushrooms, onions, garlic in a thick white wine Riesling sauce served with buttered Parmesan pasta! The BOMB!#A new fav! The chicken was so tender that you didn't need a knife to cut it! Everything complimented each other so well! It was a huge portion for only $13.95! I hope they keep this item on the menu because I'll get it again & again!  The Cuban rolls are always a hit!#Full of flavor as usual#the perfect appetizer! The complimentary warm bread & butter is always de-lish! Loved the classic flavorful strawberry lemonade! For dessert I tried the new Celebration cheesecake which has layers of chocolate, strawberry & vanilla cheesecake, regular cake topped with fun-fetti  cream cheese frosting! It was delicious! Loved the Neapolitan theme! Our server Amanda O. Was great! Even though it was a packed house, she was ON IT showing excellent customer service! She was constantly refilling our drinks, she was very attentive to all of our needs, and she was very sweet & friendly!

0,Jeff A.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,4,1.0,5.0,2018-01-07,"I first discovered the Cheesecake Factory when i was working in the LA area more than 20 years ago. This first visit left such a positive impression, i made it a point to visit this chain in several other cities over the years. I am not a huge fan of dining in chain restaurants, but i have made an exception in this case. The consistency and combination of high quality, freshness of food ingredients, very large menu selection and value for the money has made me a loyal fan.  Since moving to the Phoenix metro area several years ago, i now visit the Chandler location almost exclusively. Although the Superstition Springs (Mesa) location is closer to home, my overall dining experience in Chandler has never been less than perfect. For me, it's been a sure thing! The CKF is the type of place you can enjoy eating a meal alone, with friends or coworkers, with your spouse or significant other, or with family. Any day is a good reason to go. Why wait for a special occasion? Now that they offer curbside ""To Go"" service, you can pull up the menu online, phone in your order, drive over to the restaurant to the takeout parking spaces and call inside to let them know you are there waiting. The waitstaff delivers your food order to your car and accepts cash, debit, credit or CKF gift cards as payment. A perfect dining option for those times you are craving something from their menu but not in the mood to eat out. I have used this curbside service a few times on my way home from work when i didn't feel like cooking dinner. The inside is spacious and nicely decorated. The outside patio has lots of elbow room and is a good option from late fall to early spring here in AZ. The menu is huge. Appetizers and drinks, healthy dining options, a main course meal or just dessert and a coffee beverage are some of the many choices available. The portion sizes are plenty large to share or take home leftovers for another meal. I would have to guesstimate that over dozens of visits during the last several years, i have consumed 10's of thousands of calories. Do i regret that? Honestly, no. Each and every one of those calories has been well worth the enjoyment! So many items to love. Some of my favorites include the Chicken Samosas, Roasted Pear and Bleu Cheese Flatbread, Chinese Chicken Salad, Factory Chopped Salad, Shrimp with Angel Hair Pasta, Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken, Chicken Madeira, Peach Mint Julep, and the different Signature Lemonades, Of the cheesecakes my favorites are the Dutch Apple, the Salted Caramel, the White Chocolate Raspberry and the Lemon Meringue. My most favorite menu item is the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp! It's a struggle with myself every time  go there to convince myself to order other things on the menu.  i have never had less than perfect food, attentive, friendly and experienced wait staff, and an overall wonderful dining experience. Considering the food portions are quite large and the quality of the food is consistently fresh and delicious, the value is great",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chandler,3.16,2.86,2.98,,2.9800000000000004
