193,Bruce K.,"Knoxville, TN",420,649,1234.0,3.0,2012-01-20,"Cheesecake. Yes, that's what they're famous for.. And probably the only thing that I will eat here as everything is overpriced and the food is just okay. I came here with a group of friends weeks ago for a get together. I just ordered a drink and my brother ordered a cheesecake and calamari which I shared with. The calamari wasn't bad as it was deep fried like any other restaurant that serves calamari. Cheesecake was wonderful, apple caramel streusel. It was sweet but it wasn't to the point where my mouth was dry (then again I had Long Islands that helped me wash it down.) One of my other friends ordered a burger, and honestly to come here to order a burger isn't really a bright idea. The portions are definitely not worth the amount that you're paying, however this is a ""high class"" restaurant. And be sure to watch out on the floors. They're super greasy/slippery, as soon as you walk out of the main area and to your chairs. It seems as if you're walking on some dried oil or grease, it's kind of nasty to not think that they would not mop the floors every night. Overall, I would give it a 2.5/5 but since Yelp has stars I'll round it and give it a 3, just because that cheesecake was pretty good. But, you won't find me a regular here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=220,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.9880000000000004,3.5200000000000005
257,Grace S.,"Charlotte, NC",156,147,194.0,3.0,2012-01-24,"I have been here many times, and those times are usually for friends.  This place is good, but I don't really think people should hype it up so much.   The interior is nicely decorated, but it felt very dim when I in to eat.  I'd prefer a little more lighting there for some reason.  I thought that they could have someone make the bathroom a little cleaner though.  When I went in on Sunday, I was seated at a big circle booth.  I thought that was very cool so our group could talk and jabber a lot, but if someone had to use the bathroom, two or three people would have to get up to let someone out of the booth.   Now to the food.  The only good thing really worth it on the appetizer menu would be the sweet corn tomale.  I just couldn't get enough of it.  I tried the other appetizers from friends and thought they just tasted alright.  Nothing too snazzy.  The entrees weren't really something to die for.  The strawberry lemonade though, whew!  ALWAYS order that sweet deliciousness with a free refill.  Even during the winter it makes me think of a nice hot summer day.  I would suggest everyone to come here for the cheesecake though since it is called ""The Cheesecake Factory.""  Sometimes I have stopped by, only for the delightful sweets.   All in all, this place is just A-ok for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=280,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.9560000000000004,3.5200000000000005

This particular location feels too large, like I felt like I was getting lost in my booth b/c the place was so large.  The food was on par with what I have come to expect from this chain, but it was the service that warrants the deduction in stars. Throughout our experience the service was fine- not particularly good, not particularly bad- but that all changed as we were getting ready to leave.  I had asked for a box (b/c the portions are just too large here) and was in the process of placing my leftovers into said box when the waitress came back after running our credit card. As I still had my hand on my plate, picking at the last few fries that did not fit in the box, she swopped in and took the plate from me. Really????

224,Faith D.,"Charlotte, NC",165,1120,761.0,3.0,2012-03-18,"When you are in need of a slice of sweet sugary deliciousness, The Cheesecake Factory has got you covered. It's a staple ""nice restaurant"" sure to please even the pickiest of eaters...their menu is like a novel, granted half of it is full of advertisements.  You can quickly turn to the lunch menu, page 8. The portions are plenty and will run you around $10, give or take. However, their regular beverages will run you a solid $4. A nice perk is that they serve their ""chocolate and vanilla"" bread (that's only how my friend's daughter describes it, not the flavor) anytime of day, whether you eat lunch or dinner. They do not have very many vegetarian options, but they do have a veggie burger filled with brown rice and beets.  This location is prime...after a fun shopping spree at South Park, you can relish the day on their open patio! Service was attentive and friendly and the people working the host desk were all smiles.  I don't go here often, but it's one of my mom's favorites and when nothing but cheesecake will suffice it is my go to place (a slice will cost you approximately $10).

We had sun dried tomato pasta and a pizza. Finished it off with Red Velvet Cheesecake....big enough to share, and OMG delicious! My only ""gripe"" is that they serve free bread baskets and we never got one, forcing us to order an appetizer because my blood sugar was crashing and I needed food quickly. Fried zuchinni was to die for, and for only $5 it is a very cheap appetizer. Overall, very good and can't wait to go back!

159,Rachel O.,"Columbia, SC",208,207,924.0,2.0,2012-11-17,"I don't usually review chains but this was my 1st experience there & I was very disappointed. First off,  the restaurant is very nice looking.  I liked the ambiance from my point of view in the lobby.  When we were seated... not as much.  We were tucked in this little alley off to the side of the bar that led to what I'm sure was a nicer room that looked out into the parking lot.  We couldn't see much from where we were sitting except the waiters running back and forth and the little area where they entered orders on the computer.  But I'm jumping ahead... we got there a few minutes before 7 and had to wait 45 minutes for a table for 2.  Some people coming in after us were told up to an hour and a half! I know this because the pager/beeper they give you is only active IN their lobby.  So there were about 50-70 people all standing around this lobby starring at each other and the cheesecake in the case.  Not cool. Finally our beeper went off and then we were told to stand in a certain spot to wait for our name to be called. More waiting.  Then we were taken to our little alley table. The menu is 21 pages long.  And then there is a Skinnylicious menu on top of that. Ridiculous.  We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip.  It was fine.  I've had better. I ordered the Pasta Carbonara with Chicken.  It was OK. Again... I've had better. Boyfriend got the Bistro Shrimp Pasta: Crispy Battered Shrimp, Fresh Mushrooms, Tomato and Arugula Tossed with Spaghettini and a Basil-Garlic-Lemon Cream Sauce I didn't taste it but he said it was fine but nothing he would crave again later - and that he liked another pasta dish from another restaurant much better. We each ordered a slice of cheesecake.  I got the Chocolate mouse cheesecake which I thought would be light and fluffy but no.  It was very heavy. It was very expensive in my opinion.  We both got water, we shared an app, each had an entree and a piece of cheesecake and this came to $71 after tip.  For what we got? It was not worth it at all.   2 stars on Yelp means ""Meh. I've experienced better."" That is exactly right in this case.  We will most definitely not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=180,3.44,3.44,3.44,2.7920000000000007,3.4400000000000004
234,Rachel B.,"Charlotte, NC",209,211,92.0,4.0,2013-01-03,"Best chain ever. Yes, it's a chain and yes there's tons of local eats, but I argue that there is no place where a party of 20 people can get everything they're looking for, no matter what they like, what dietary restrictions they have and what they're in the mood for. The mood lighting at night is great for a romantic dinner that isn't too intimate (no pressure!) or a nightcap and cheesecake (sexy!). The hours are later than most other places in the area, too, so if you're running to grab a bite after a movie or something, the Factory is a great option. I tend to battle between getting the Thai Lettuce Wraps (fresh, quality, delish!) and the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad, no cucumbers, but almost always get both because I can't stop myself. Sure it's way too much food but these are things that I sometimes DREAM about. And sure there are vietnamese and thai places that carry the lettuce wraps in town but I've tried and every time I'm left yearning for that tamarind cashew sauce.  BRB, drooling. --------------- And, I'm back! So yes, the service is always attentive but the waits can be long, especially at peak dinner hours and all day Saturday & Sunday during mall hours. The bar is fully stocked, bathrooms always clean (and posh!), and the outdoor patio makes for a pretty nice summer lunch spot too. They've got a bar bites menu that's available to keep it light on the pockets, and of course more cheesecakes than should be legal to tempt you into ordering just 1..... ok, 2 slices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=240,3.44,3.44,3.44,3.024,3.4400000000000004
239,Cindy A.,"New Orleans, LA",16,80,17.0,5.0,2013-01-05,"I love The Cheesecake Factory.  I used to work near one in Seattle and was somewhat of a regular.  After moving to Louisiana, I have to travel a minimum of five hours to get to one.   On my way to Virginia over the holidays, we drove through Charlotte specifically so that we could go to CF.   This location of CF is by far, the best I have ever been.  We had an awesome booth all the way in the back (read -- away from all the noise).  Our server was friendly and helpful.  The food at this location was great!  Hot, huge portions and there was no skimping when we asked for extra sauce for our dishes (a must if you are a sauce freak like we are). My daughter had her usual farfalle pasta (chicken, mushrooms, peas and some other stuff) and I had the chicken madeira (chicken, mozzarella, madeira sauce, asparagus and smashed taters).  It was all soooooooooooooo delicious!!   We ordered one cheesecake -- the banana -- which is served with freshly sliced bananas.  It's now my second favorite to the lemon with raspberry glaze.   When CF comes to Baton Rouge or New Orleans, my life will be complete.  Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but I will be stupendously thrilled. My recommendations --  Thai lettuce wraps (enough for a meal or appetizer to share) and then something from the specialties page, pasta or salad.  Skip the stuff that you can get anywhere any day of the week (burger).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=240,3.48,3.48,3.48,3.124,3.4800000000000004

This place is ALWAYS crowded during dinner time, if you come around 6-8 you will probably have to wait unless if you made a reservation, this is particularly true on the weekends. I have tried numerous appetizers, pasta entree, burger entree, and cheesecake desserts. Overall, the flavor of the food is great, the presentation is also commendable and the portion is very large. Because of the large portion, on some of their dishes they offer 1/2 sizes. The interior decoration is very nice, 2 floor high ceiling, golden deco, very spacious and many different sections. They have a full bar overlooking a great view. When you order pasta, they always bring out parmasan and shred it right in front of you. Love their pesto and sundries tomatoes. They also always bring put a basket of wheat and white bread after you order. Entrees range around 12-18 dollar. Appetizers around $8-12. Their appetizers are pretty big too, i ordered the avocado spring rolls once and i was able to eat it as an entree. The avocado spring rolls are amazing, i highly recommend them. They are different than any other spring rolls you've had. Perfect flavor and consistency over a crispy shell. If i remembered correctly, there are 6 large half pieces of spring rolls. The cheesecakes are around $6-8 per piece. Very large size served on a large plate, can be shared among 2-3 people.

These rolls are chocked full of crazy amounts of flavor and texture. The middle is gooey and savory and the outside is crispy and delicious. And the dipping sauce, some sort of cilantro chutney... SHUT UP! It's amazing. I also really enjoy the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes appetizer. These little babies are sweet and salty at the same time. Very filling. Nice presentation. My favorite appetizer salad is the French Country Salad. Veggie friendly and delish. The only thing I've had here I have NOT enjoyed was Evelyn's Favorite Pasta.

Ordered two alcoholic drinks one of which was a mint mojito never had anyone butchered the drink that much it was awful. After waiting an hour after finishing our appetizers our food still wasn't out yet nor was the server anywhere to be found, it being not busy and also a Monday night we didnt understand why it was taking so long, finally the manager came over and told us that our food was accidentally sent to another table, understandable we was patient and said its ok 10 mins later someone other than the server brought the food over to our table and it was not what we ordered. Not touching the food we waited a while til the server came to check on us told her the issue she took the plates away and returned with our order, I'm guessing my food was sitting under the warmer in the kitchen for a while bc my steak Dianne was over cooked and dry when I ordered it rare, and the salmon was fishy and cold. The only thing that was truly acceptable was the cheese cake I guess if they messed that up they shouldn't be called the cheese cake factory!

The restaurant was crazy busy and it's huge, so it was really loud.  The tables are like a faux-marble type material, so when the bus-boys were setting the tables and throwing down the utensils repeatedly, the sounds got real old fast. We went here for lunch  and got the nachos with chicken as our app.  There was literally 5 random pieces of chicken on the nachos and it was gross and the flavoring was super sweet, which is weird to put on nachos.  The chips were saturated in grease and I'm not really sure why... I ordered the Monterrey Burger to be cooked medium.  It was burnt/charred in some spots and completely brown throughout the burger.  It wasn't that great.  The arugula it came with was put on top of the hot burger, so it was all wilted and not the best consistency.  I only ate half my burger.   We all got cheesecake since we felt like we kind of had to.  I ordered the Oreo cheesecake and it fell short IMO.  The cheesecake itself was delicious! However, it was covered in thick chocolate cake and it was so rich - I didn't eat that part.

238,Amy C.,"Charlotte, NC",71,355,145.0,3.0,2013-07-15,"I have to say, first, that the customer service that I received at The Cheesecake Factory went above and beyond, definitely.  My server was excellent and after an issue with a dish, the manager who visited my table also went way beyond what most would have bothered with, in particular since it's The Cheesecake Factory and losing one customer would seemingly not be a big deal, since I arrived at 5:15 on a Thursday evening to a packed house.   I haven't been to the Factory in years.  I don't like going to the mall and I don't like waiting an inordinate amount of time to be seated.  I had a craving for cheesecake, so I made a run here after work.  Since it's attached to SouthPark mall, there seems to never be any down time at all.  Even upon my early arrival I had to wait a few minutes to be seated.  No biggie, I was seated within 5 or so minutes and instantly greeted by my server, Bonnie, who was absolutely fantastic.  She had her hands full and the section was completely booked, but she did a fantastic job.  I heard a table near me compliment how well she did, after she returned to thank them for what I assume was an extra-large tip. The food: Fried cheese sticks:  6 triangles.  Thick breading, nice melty cheese.  Marinara that was served with was meh.  Tasted weird, kind of plain, but nothing offensive.   Fried chicken salad:  When they first opened this location, this was my go-to order.  Huge ""normal"" salad with fried chicken on top of it.  In the many years it has been since my last visit, the recipe has changed and I was not a fan of the new way.  The menu said ""mixed greens"" and I forgot that kale is no longer just a garnish.  Too much kale, way too much kale.  But the fried chicken served with it was quite good, as was the corn and pecans with the honey mustard dressing.  I picked through the salad, but it was mostly kale, so I just ate the chicken.  My server noticed and said she would bring me something else, but I told her it was my misunderstanding, no big deal, I ate all of the chicken and a few pieces of lettuce and that was fine.   Turtle cheesecake:  Eh.... it was okay.  Creamy cheesecake with a healthy swirl of whipped cream.  Large dollop of a thick chocolate cream on top, plenty of nuts.  It was fine.   The server let the manager (I believe he said his name was Johann) know about the salad and he came by the table and told me that had been taken off of my bill.   I told him as well that it wasn't necessary as I ate all of the chicken and what I could of the salad.  He again said it was taken care of and if I had any other problems to let him know.  Very nice and totally unexpected.  Excellent customer service. I don't know when I will return, but the great job by my waitress and the manager on duty definitely left a very positive reflection on the place, I just wish the food was as good as the staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=240,3.36,3.36,3.36,3.0200000000000005,3.3600000000000003
153,Mike M.,"Fairfax, VA",1312,108,110.0,4.0,2013-07-17,"I'd first like to preface my review by saying that I prefer to eat at non-chain restaurants too.  But of the chains, I have a special fondness for the Cheesecake Factory. Back at my old job in Virginia I would take clients out to lunch quite often, and where did they always want to go? The Cheesecake Factory. Have gone there so much, I really got to try a variety of different dishes, from the salads, to the pastas, to the steaks, salmon, burgers, sandwiches, etc. I tend to order the louisiana chicken pasta or a steak. Or one of their great salads if it's lunch time.  I was never a fan of restaurants with such an extensive menu, but Cheesecake does a good job. I cannot recall ordering anything that I didn't like. Don't get me wrong, I can't recall ordering a dish and thinking that it was my favorite ever, but Cheesecake is pretty consistent. And their portions are large so you feel like you're getting your money's worth. That's why I think it's always busy on Weekends for lunch and dinner. There really is a lot to choose from, which is good when you have a group of people that can't decide on cuisine that night.  The service isn't bad. I think that people in general need to understand that when a restaurant is super busy sometimes the level of service dips a little bit. And not all server is created equal. In every restaurant there are servers who move more efficiently, make few mistakes, and...well...for a lack of a more eloquent way to put it...are just better than others. And unless you're a regular you probably won't know who's who. Having waited tables in the past I probably tend to have more patience with service. That being said I've had great service on weekends and off-peak hours here than I did on the weekend dinners that were had here. coincidence? I doubt it.  Not much needs to be said about the cheesecake. It's always terrific.

231,Jeremy P.,"Marshall, NC",3,55,3.0,4.0,2013-07-28,"Me and my family visited The Cheesecake Factory for the first time tonight and was pleasantly surprised.  First off, we are not from Charlotte and we do not have a Cheesecake factory near our house.  We are Big Bang Theory super fans so when we saw it we knew we had to try it.   If you are like us and have never been or saw one other than on the show, then you will be in for a big surprise too!   Atmosphere:  We arrived around 8:30pm on a Sunday night.  The wait was minimal even though it was pretty busy.  We requested outside seating since it was a perfect night for it, and were escorted right out.  Tables were nice, and had a small candle on it for a nice little touch.  The building the restaurant is located in is very nice as well.  Very upscale looking and a classy place overall.  Much different vibe and style than was in the show.  ( Hang with me through the BBT show comments, I am sure others are wondering the same as we were. )  8/10 Menu and Price Point:  As most others have mentioned the menu is very very extensive.  You would be really hard pressed to not find something that you like.  Very detailed which I like because I am a picky eater, and nicely laid out considering the size of the menu.  As for price, I got the Penne, My wife got the Chicken and Biscuits (think chicken pot pie), and my daughter just wanted cheese sticks.  We also got 1 piece of the Oreo Dream cheesecake and the total bill was 53.00 and some change.  Not too bad considering the portions are huge and the food was very tasty.  7/10 Service:  When we first walked in the greeter was not super friendly like most places of that caliber but, when we were seated things changed.  Our waiter was extremely nice and super helpful.  He was very attentive despite being pretty busy, and took the time to talk to us and offer suggestions.  He even addressed my daughter who is 10, which most of the time wait staff just look at us for her order.  I liked that and i think she did too.  8/10 Food:  The food was very good.  Like i mentioned above my daughter got an appetizer for her main meal which was the Cheesesticks.  She liked them and even made the comment she wished there was more.  On a couple they were overcooked a little but she didnt complain and just peeled off the coating.  My wife had the Chicken and Biscuits and she really enjoyed it and gives it a 8/10.  She could only eat about half a quarter of it due to the sheer amount she was given.  I got the Penne Pasta, and it was cooked perfect for me.  It was a little short on sauce but really was very tasty.  I did add a little salt, and I asked the waiter for some Parmesan cheese and he brought out a block and grated some fresh for me right at the table.  Im a big guy and I couldn't eat it all due to the portion size.  8/10 for me on the pasta.   I will definitely be back for me on my next visit.   P.S....

An extensive menu. Stark white shirts that I have no clue how every server keeps them bright white all shift. But have you ever been by for happy hour?! Best in Charlotte. Hands down.  Post up at the bar (HH only at the bar) and grab a menu. About a dozen different options, all from the Cheesecake Factory's regular appetizer menu all for $5 each. Chris and I decided to get the tex mex eggrolls and the buffalo blasts. They delivered the dishes and damnnn... full-sized plates. And if you've ever been to CCF you know how much food that is - and for $5! I couldn't believe it wasn't smaller HH portions! The buffalo blasts were piled high - 8 to the plate. And is a crispy, fluffy, deep fried pocket. Bite in and it is filed with juicy grilled chicken tossed in buffalo sauce. And as a huge lover of all things spicy, I was in love. I recommend with sour cream. Awesome cooling effect to the buffalo. We ended up eating 3 of the blasts and 4 out of the 6 eggrolls. Packed a to-go box and left highly satisfied.  Only downside, I work in Uptown and the happy hour here goes from 4 to 6pm. To get to South Park after work is always a challenge so if I have my heart set on some buffalo blasts, need to slip out a bit early. And you must sit at the bar. Which consists of 10 seats.

One positive thing I can say is that they have an extensive menu.  In general, you would be hard-pressed not to find something you are in the mood to eat.   However, I've gone in there before and nothing has sounded appetizing - maybe it's just too many selections.  I can say that they have decent (but pricey) salads and I had good fish and chips from there.  I went there with a party and my boss ordered the barbecue salmon, which was WAY too salty for her. This was a day we were out to celebrate a co-worker leaving and had a party of four.  We waited almost 20 minutes to get seated, and then another 20 minutes almost before we could order.  By the time our food had arrived, we had been there over an hour.  This was lunch time, which was frustrating.  Our lunch there lasted over an hour and a half by the time we got dessert. As far as their cheesecake goes, this has been the biggest disappointment.  It used to be you paid $8 and got huge pieces which were big enough for two to share.  However, my piece last time was about half the size it had been before.  It looks like they are trying to scale back on the sizes.  And when I thought about it, I got one of the specialty cheesecakes and so only about a third of it was actual cheesecake, and the rest of it had toppings woven in.  Not on TOP, as you would expect, but cutting into the piece of cheesecake itself.  The cheesecake part was not as good as it should have been for the price. This location is swanky and nice, but every time I've been the service was very slow.  And since getting dessert and a lunch special was over $20 at lunch time, it seems a little too pricey for the quality of food and service you get there.  For me, ""meh"" just kind of describes how I feel about this Cheesecake Factory location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=200,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.8240000000000003,3.2800000000000002

The service was great, very attentive and friendly.  One thing I do like is the variety of food offered which is both good and bad, I guess.  We had the avocado eggrolls which are pretty tasty, I don't want to know how many calories were in them but nice chunks of avocado fried in an egg roll wrapper were complimented by a sweet and spicy dipping sauce. I had the mushroom burger which frankly was very good.  It was well put together with very flavorful mushrooms and swiss cheese.  The cover the burger in some kind of wine sauce which was welcomed.  Fries....nasty.  Too much salt ruined them.

I like it dipped in their homemade ranch better than the sweet dipping sauce the egg rolls come with.  Chili Rellenos were somewhat disappointing. The hot, melty pepper jack cheese inside is awesome, but the pepper has a very green pepper flavor rather than any spiciness. The crunchy fried outside is good but overall this was a miss for me. Not really worth the calories.  The veggie burger was made with beets (along with brown rice, farro and black bean) and was not good at all. It was cold and sweet and bland.  You can't go wrong with any of the desserts. We had the banana cream cheesecake, which is our standby favorite.

Vodka, Peach liquor swirled with raspberries and topped with a mint leaf so it looks like a peach in a glass. Perfect! Always delicious, and most certainly expect to order two! Mmmmmm!  Appetizers: We ordered the wings without the sauce. They were okay. A little dry but we just doused them in blue cheese and ranch. There are plenty of other options so unless you're craving wings try something else. We also ordered the Buffalo Blasts. Now these things are freaking delicious!

Crispy on the outside juicy flavorful meat stuffed on the inside (and they are not stingy with the filling) served hot with ranch dressing...like Nike says Just Do It! You can thank me later!

I'm a huge fan of the lemon sauce (always ask for extra) but last night the salmon just didn't do it for me. Don't get me wrong, portion size was not the issue. But it was just very bland.

My waiter was Mr. positive but didn't wait on me or ask me if everything  was OK.  He was concerned that my tooth picks that held the sandwich together was taken apart.  I told him that I didn't like butter all over my bread.  He said, ""OK, just wanted to be sure that they didn't leave it that way.""   I would expect that he should have asked me if I wanted bread without the butter but he didn't and got away so fast that I couldn't ask him.  He never came back to ask me if I needed tea or anything. The soup was so bad I didn't eat it at all.  I ate the salad or there would be no lunch. When he picked  up my plate, he said, I guess this means that you have no room for cheesecake.  I guess he said that because most of the food was still on my plate. Once again he sped off not given me a chance to tell him that the soup was awful.  Very disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=320,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0120000000000005,3.0000000000000004

The only downside to our trip was the ~45 minute wait, which was to be expected at dinner time on New Year's Eve, I suppose. The Factory doesn't take reservations, so that's how it goes. Our server, Kenneth, was extremely enthusiastic, although he kept referring to my counterpart as ""m'lady,"" which was pretty great and also slightly emasculating. I ordered salad with my burger but got fries; whatever, the fries were great, and there was enough ketchup for both the burger and the fries, which is SUCH a rarity at places without self-serve ketchup. She got pasta, which was also really good, and we shared a Turtle cheesecake. ""I mean, the place is called the Cheesecake Factory. We ought to get some cheesecake.""

269,Marshall R.,"Columbia, SC",7,8,2.0,4.0,2014-02-11,"I've been there twice and it's a good place to go on a nice date. I prefer the places that are more casual or they have their own thing going on, but I won't hold that against The Cheesecake Factory. This place is obviously known for their cheesecake, in case you couldn't figure that out by the name of the restaurant, so I will start by talking about what they do best and move onto the meal from there. All slices of cheesecake are big and rich enough to share. These things are huge and if you're eating one by yourself then you are either a mammoth or your pig. Don't hate! Just embrace the truth! My wife and I ordered the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, which had Hulk testicle size chunks of cookie dough inside of the cheesecake. With two big squirts of whipped cream on the top and the tip of the cheesecake to complete the imagery that I'm shooting for. It was simply amazing! When the waitress first stopped by to ask what we would like to drink I asked for water and an Old Fashioned. To which she replied ""How hot would you like that?"" That's when I learned that one of their burgers is called The Old Fashioned. As I write this I now realize that I should have ordered The Old Fashioned to go w/ my Old Fashioned, but let me tell you what I did get before I get too carried away. I got Renee's Special which consisted of a Turkey Sandwich, the Soup of the Day (Clam Chowder) and a House Salad. Very tasty! My only complaint on the food was that the bread, I believe it was Sour Dough was too hard. Not stale or anything, just the crust was hard as a Hulk sized... ...never mind. My Old Fashioned was very tasty and helped me take my mind off of the man taking his three disrespectful daughters out. This good man was taking his daughters out for an early Valentine's Day dinner and all three of them were on their phone and iPads. Hopefully it doesn't take him having a heart attack from the cheesecake he ate for them to realize how disrespectful they were being. I would give 5 Strong stars but I'm going to subtract one for how close the tables were. I didn't even have to lean over to take the food from the person next to me.

She took the pager and called the next name so I proceeded back in line. A guy calls my name and I tell him the same story so he said he was getting me seated since he can't hold tables and would have my order transferred. He said they were busy. Then he asked if I needed a menu and I said no.( I knew what I wanted. Not the friendliest guy.

For my 21st birthday all I wanted to do was eat at the infamous Cheesecake Factory. We went around 3ish so the wait was only about 5minutes.  Being my 21st I kind of expected for the server to at least notice when I got carded and ordered drinks that it was my birthday and he didn't. The drinks were good though. My boyfriend told the server as he passed by that I was a little hurt and the climatic moment I had been waiting for was ruined and he admitted that he only checked the year.  Overall the food was meh. I got the steak Diane and shrimp scampi with mashed potatoes. They must pre plate the potatoes when you get the combinations because it turned into a molded shape in the middle. The shrimp and steak were bleh and I can't even complain that I only received 3 shrimps and 3 steak medallions because they weren't very good. Boyfriend got the teriyaki chicken and it was fatty. He said it was alright but the menu says it comes with a plantain. They had a grilled banana on it- maybe they expect people to not know the difference?  Cheesecake was very good though.  I will never be visiting again. The server did the bare minimum. We left spending $115 including tip but the boyfriend was charged $121. Even though it's $6, that's sketchy. Boyfriend called the manager and the manager said to call his bank because he saw that we were charged $115 but he had to keep explaining that he was over charged.

Having spent the entire winter, and well into March in a snowy DC mess, it was great to sit on the outdoor patio at 4:00 in the afternoon with a Root Beer and a cool breeze blowing in my face. -Minimal wait. Maybe no one wanted to sit on said patio, but the waiting area was 50 people deep of couples, families, etc and we only had a 10 minute wait for first available.  -That wide variety of menu items you know and love from CF, including a nice selection of lunch portions (and lunch prices).  -Friendly staff. Something I miss once I moved to the DMV. -Quality ingredients, and tasty food. I ordered the lunch grilled salmon with broccoli and mashed potatoes for $13.95. The salmon was well-seasoned and cooked perfectly. Other dishes ordered at the table included a cheeseburger, cobb salad, and chicken wings. All were devoured.  -Food presentation is great. I love the way they serve the dishes to you with thought and care. -Happy Birthday! My cheesecake plate had Happy Birthday written on it, with a pink candle for me to blow out! They also sang Happy Birthday to me. Ahh never gets old even in my late 20's! *Cons* -My broccoli was served cold.

We normally wait 15-20 mins, which we are very understanding of. We got seated to wait 10 mins before a sever saw us. Her name was Blair, I believe. She seemed rather annoyed that we had two kids with us, and preoccupied with other things. We waiting 10 mins to just get our drinks. I am a completely understanding person, especially when a server is seated too many tables at once, but she was talking with other servers, joking around, our son had asked her for some extra dressing and she clearly forgot ( but realized when we had pre-bused our table.) Not only did our drinks were not refilled, she did not once check on us to see how our food was until we we're wanting to order dessert. It took an additional 15 mins to get dessert, which we kinda regretted ordering to have to wait that long. Not only did I leave 20% gratuity, because I am in the tipping business and I do unto others. But I never normally complain on service, and I felt like I was a bothersome to her, I have never had issues at any Cheesecake Factory other than today. But I don't think this woman liked kids or liked us because we are ""young parents"" with tattoos that we would even tip. She probably shouldn't be in this business of customer service.

Any other time we have gone, the food is always okay but pricey and we always get two pieces of cheesecake to share. This time around, my husband ordered the meatloaf lunch and when he got it, the meatloaf was dry and he compared it to chow hall food in the military. He said chow hall food was better than that! When the waiter came back like 15 minutes later, I told him that the food as gross. He took it away and never said a word. The manager popped up about 10 minutes later and offered him a menu but told him that everyone's tastes are different and they have never had a complaint about the meatloaf before. My thoughts were, ""it's dry and tough....Who would eat that?"" My husband just ordered a soup and salad lunch combo after he got another menu which was priced at like $15. The salad was horrible and the soup tasted like vegetable water almost. When our waiter came to the table, of course I had to be the one to call out the issues because my husband won't and I didn't want to have to pay for something that he didn't eat. Of course they did nothing about it. They just brought out the cheesecake and made us pay for a meal he did not eat or enjoy. Since I'm heading to Charlotte for my 24th birthday next weekend, I will definitely remember not to go back there and they won't get our business again.

264,S R.,"Pineville, NC",0,52,8.0,1.0,2014-08-14,"This  CF location has gone down in the last year or so. We have noticed several service issues, especially when dining in the bar area.  At our last outing, our server took almost 10 minutes to come to the table after we sat down to greet us, pass out menus and take drink orders. She was slow to bring drinks, didn't bring a side salad that was requested before the meal. The food was subpar, and they totally botched my order by giving me the wrong dish.  Everyone's food also arrived lukewarm, like it had been sitting for a while. We did address it with the manager who was apologetic and discounted the bill. We were treating an out of town guest who had never been to CF before and were totally embarrassed that we had brought him here. We walked out thinking we should have gone somewhere else in the South Park area. Eating out is becoming more and more of a luxury and it is disappointing when you got out expecting a nice dining experience and  get bad service and bad food. We will not be returning to CF anytime soon and I can no longer recommend it. UPDATED :10/13/14- After making a complaint on the the company website regarding the above visit, we were sent a $25 e Gift  card. We redeemed the card at brunch  about a week a ago and had a good meal and great service. We intentionally sat in the restaurant, not the bar area.

I don't think you can go wrong with what you choose, though. My favorite dish is the shepherds pie. It's a huge portion and so delicious. I like that, during lunchtime, you can get the half portion. I usually still end up taking some home! If you're not starving, I recommend getting the cuban rolls, which are an appetizer. I enjoy the cuban sandwich, but actually love these even more. They're so crispy and come with a great dipping sauce. Oh, and the cheesecake is a must- duh. Even if you have to take it to-go.

I went there with the lady and another couple to celebrate achievements on all of our parts. The girls ordered drinks, which they thoroughly enjoyed.  And then the food came out. I ordered...uh... some jamaican jerk thing? With chicken instead of shrimp? Jeez, it's so hard to remember when the menu is that big. I'm sure that there are a bunch of jamaican jerk things with chicken. But this one had beans and a mango pineapple salsa! And plantains!  The chicken was excellent, the slaw was good (but room temp, not cold), the beans were okay (they lacked seasoning), and the yucca was seriously overcooked. I was with my Irish buddy who had never seen plantains before and he asked me if I ordered shit (yes, they were that charred and shriveled. I gotta say, I don't blame him). However, it's really hard to mess up the internal flavor of a plantain, and overall, it was fine. The lady ordered Fish Tacos, and she was not pleased. But I can't blame her, they had soaked the damn thing is so much sauce that the actual tortilla broke when she tried to pick it up because it was too saturated. She said it also lacked any flavor, though I didn't try it. The cheesecake IS consistently wonderful though. I do wish they gave a weeee bit bigger slices, but what can you do.

The timing was totally off b/c they sat us in 15mins. We should've known then that it was too good to be true. My husband ordered a beverage, but never received it throughout the course of our meal. We ordered our dinner around 10:30pm and it took about 45mins to receive our food. We were told by the waiter that it takes a long time to cook a steak well. Really? First of all, you don't tell your customers an excuse like that. It doesn't take that long to cook a steak well either. Then when the food came out, my entree was cold. So that tells me that most of our food was already done but not brought out. Once we receive our food, we saw the waiter one time, then never again. We waited at least 15mins after we finished eating just to get the check. At this point my party is very irritated and just want to leave. We finally asked 2 other servers for a manager. One server stated that the managers were very busy. I told him that they shouldn't be too busy if a customer is requesting to see them. The manager comes out and asked if everything was ok? We all said no, not at all. As he walks over to me, i hear him mumble under his breath, ""everything hasn't been ok for me tonight either."" Or something to that effect. When I asked him what did he say for clarification, he changed his words and said ""what's wrong?"" Like he really cared. Well after explaining to him about all of our problems and he could see that our table was full of dishes, meaning no one had been by to clear the table, offer dessert or coffee. He apologizes for everything, comps my meal but didn't offer anything else for the rest of my family that traveled out of town and are here for the first time.

I made the ""mistake"" of ordering 3 apps for the 2 of us, so much food! We ordered the mac and cheese balls, cheese and spinach dip and southwest chicken rolls. Everything was really good though the cheese and spinach dip could have benefited with some seasoning. The mac and cheese balls and the southwest chicken rolls were very hearty, we had to take a lot of food home with us.

I won't be buying drinks from here again.  The half off THE FIRST SLICE of cheesecake was a great deal, my boyfriend and I each bought a slice. I got the caramel turtle while he got the tiramisu. The caramel turtle was amazing, wasn't too cream cheesy and had the right amount of sweetness. The tiramisu was just meh, I wouldn't get it again.

We went on a Friday night around 8 and only had about a 15-20 minute wait. We were seated and our waiter seemed very nice at first and told us to take our time and soak in everything. I was amazed at the menu, it had anything and everything you could possibly want and then some.  The fried Mac & Cheese balls were AMAZBALLS and our food was delicious.  I was very disappointed with our service though, he started off great, and I don't know what happened, but it seemed like we were bothering him by sitting in his section. He treated the other two tables he was waiting on very different and was super friendly but any time he came to the table we had to request refills on drinks and he just never checked in at all. This was a huge disappointment because like I said I had super high expectations coming in.    Bad Service aside, the Cheesecake is to DIE for!!!!! Oh My Goodness, My husband tried the original cheesecake, but I had to go all in. I got the Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake and let me tell you it did not disappoint.  It was a layer of brownie, topped with a coconut chocolate chip cheese cake, topped with chocolate cake, and if that wasn't fat enough it also had a coconut pecan frosting on it.  Yes it was a completely fat *ss item, but it was so worth it. I would stay on the elliptical all day to have that once a week.  Overall it was an ok experience.  The food was AMAZING, but the service was very disappointing. :( I will definitely  give it another try and for sure at least get some cheesecake to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=140,3.4,3.45,3.45,3.1800000000000006,3.43

I had been years earlier with friends of mine and I said that time I had to have my mother try this place as well. I told her she would be in store for a great treat and that's what she got. As we entered this place to put our name the list for a table, the line was out the door and there were many patrons sitting outside in the nice sitting area for there name to be called as well. The wait was about 30 minutes for a table. That was fine since we didn't have anywhere in particular to go this Saturday afternoon.  The 30 minutes came and went fast by us people watching others going in and coming out of the mall. Once we turned in our buzzer it was still a 5 minute wait to get seated still. We finally were placed in a busy, small corner of the restaurant by the hostess. This was cool because it was just 2 of us and enough space for both of us. Our waitress came and introduced herself within minutes of us sitting down. We looked over the menu for awhile. After bringing our drinks the waitress informed us that she was leaving for the day and another waitress would handled us from here on out. This was fine as long as we still got top notch service. The menu was filled with all kinds of things, chicken, pasta, hamburgers, and things like that. I had a very hard trying to choose what I wanted to eat. It was either the Parmesan chicken or the Seafood pasta. I ended up choosing the chicken and my mother chose the 'glamburger'. Both were great choices. My dish came with 3 chicken breasts, green beans, and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were out of this world!!!!! They were absolutely amazing. The chicken and green beans were good but I couldn't get enough of the potatoes. My mother enjoyed her hamburger and fries. It was a pretty big burger too. We both had tons to take home.  Then came the dessert!!! How could you go to this restaurant and not order cheesecake?!?!?!?!?!? I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake but I do love a Strawberry cheesecake and that's what I got and my mother ordered the Key Lime cheesecake. Only complaint I have about my cheesecake is the bottom crust. I didn't particularly care of it but the rest was delicious. My mother really enjoyed this little dinner we had!!! I'm so glad that I was able to have her dine here with me for the first time!!! I'm sure this won't be her last because she is now HOOKED!!!!

However I have a teenager and this place ROCKS to teens so we end up here from time to time unfortunately. When I'm forced to eat here I enjoy the small plates menu items which include the avocado rolls, salmon rolls & mushroom pizza. Our teenager ALWAYS indulge in the Buffalo Blast as an app and chicken tenders with fries as a main course. The hubby alternates between Jamaican Black Bean chicken and the Miso Salmon. I personally LOVE the Miso however this location is off on flavor and the whole Miso experience.  It's pretty weird that Grand Luxe Cafe and Cheesecake Factory are owned by the same company. I prefer Grand Luxe as its much more upscale and the food options are better and much more tasty and presented better. Grand Luxe would've been a perfect fit for SouthPark mall, wishful thinking as I'm a Chicago girl and we have it ALL.

I couldn't even see the booth or menu and saw other tables using their cell phone light to look at the menu. When did the lighting change?

The wine selection isn't that great and the wine we both ordered was horrible. As for the entrees, again, the crab cakes were blah. My friend got the Chicken Romano and was a pile of spaghetti with breaded chicken, which I found very bland. After attempting to order another drink, not another glass of wine, I never received it. Finally asked for the bill, which reflected that second drink.  The worst part about it, $70 for two drinks and two entrees. Isn't this the Cheesecake Factory?

I have been a regular customer to the Cheesecake Factory in Kansas. However this Charlotte one was my first experience. I didn't mind waiting for 1 hr 15 mins and didn't mind the fading lights. Lights were very dim to read the menu comfortably but I didn't mind as I knew what I wanted to order. I always start with Avocado egg rolls as they are my favorite. However they weren't as crispy as I have had them earlier, it seemed they were sitting on the kitchen counter for around 10 mins after being fried. Which resulted in the lack of crispness.  For the entree I wished to try a new item, the ratatouille toast. The presentation was beautiful and appetizing. The ratatouille was delightful however the toast was burnt and very dry. It was hard to eat but thinking about my prior experience with Cheesecake Factory I gave it a go hoping that the next piece would be better. But I realized it was hopeless cause. This was reported to the manager and he offered to replace it but by then I just lost my appetite. He took it off the bill which was a kind gesture. I wouldn't have mind paying for it as its all about the having a good experience. For desserts it was lemoncello cream torte, which is a masterpiece.

Once we were seated it went all down hill from there. We didnt get a ""hey how are U"" nor good afternoon, The waitress Whitney K. acted as if we were a bother the whole time. I ordered the veggie appetizer, had to ask for sauce, then I ordered the fish and chips-  asked her if I could substitute the the cole slaw, she said ""no its a Garnish and we cant do that"". She never asked if I wanted to maybe pay extra for a salad or maybe another item. I had to ask for vinegar for my fish, not really understanding at this point why I didnt jus pay and leave. I was so done so no matter what she said or did I wasnt hearing it. Next I asked for the manager, he proceeded to listen and apologize.  The food really wasnt good after all this mishap, we paid and I left no Tip, which I have never done, this could have been my child.

After being seated between two groups of folks along the bar seating area, we were just getting a taste of the evenings adventure as it took approx 5-6 minutes for our server to come over and take our drink order.  We ordered ONE Chicken Marsala to be split, It was not long after that our bread and water arrived, but that was all.  By now it was around 10pm as this was clearly stated by our guest at the table beside us as it was getting late and they were ready to leave.  It was about 5 minutes later that the table to the  right of us received their meals and they had time to finish their food even after ordering 5 deserts to go.  At last look, it was 10:38, we had run out of time, patience and understanding.  Our server appeared to be distracted by a table we will refer to as ""friends"" since he was at that table for at least ten minutes - socializing. He did bring by an empty plate for us to share our meal should it ever arrive.  We received two refills during this time. At no time was an apology given for the lack of food coming from the kitchen.  The table to the right was cleaned and a new group of four guest were seated.  The hostess stated that they would be taken care of ""she promised""......I stated that ""they should not believe the lies"", as we were obviously not taken care of.  They brought this to their service attention, but our own server arrived and I made it clear that we were leaving.  He suggested that we speak to a manager, however it was too late.  I stopped by the hostess stand but the manager came by.

The bill has an uncanny resemblance to the U.S. national debt.  The cheesecake, however, is distinctly unique.

We are full by the time we are done, so we always take our cheesecake to go.  Can't go there without getting cheesecake as it is awesome and cheesecake is my favorite!  My favorites are the red velvet cheesecake and the apple streusel, which we happened to get both of those this time.  Normally we try out different ones each time, they have some other good ones as well.  I am disappointed that they got rid of my favorite a couple years ago - the oreo cheesecake, but now they have the oreo dream extreme, I've had it once, but just give me an entire oreo cheesecake rather than all the chocolate richness in the cake and other layers! We will be back!  (PS we are now out of giftcards, anyone who wants to give us one we will be happy to take ;-D )",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=20,3.6,3.49,3.49,2.8640000000000003,3.5340000000000003

118,Corbin M.,"Charlotte, NC",104,3,,1.0,2016-09-25,"Suggested Cheesecake Factory for a birthday dinner meetup with family from out of town.  We've been coming to CF for years, all over the country for several reasons.  One, variety of the menu.  Two, consistency.  Three, convenience.  You don't go to CF for its uniqueness or specialty menu, you go because you know exactly what you (should) be getting . . . This local CF failed at 2 out of 3 tonight.  Convenience: 30-45 minute wait at 5:50 pm on Sunday that was every bit of 45 minutes, yet plenty of open tables in our section.  Understaffed perhaps.  Followed by excessively slow service.  Forgotten items (missed an app and a side), too long to take orders, too long to bus the table, if at all mid service.  Water refills nonexistent.  This is restaurant 101 stuff. Consistency: failed here too.  Steak undercooked and cold (credit where due, at least it wasn't overcooked), menu items I've had elsewhere simply not the same (a cardinal sin of the dreaded chain restaurant), and in one case the dish was served with a significantly different setup than described on the menu.  All prepared with minimal adequacy.  It was edible but nothing remarkable or even good by CF standards. Saw another table leave in frustration after walking up to the service station for a drink refill for the same reasons: slow, incompetent service. I guess what this Cheesecake Factory has going for it is an anchor location in the local high end mall and a captured audience.  They simply do not need to perform at restaurant fundamentals to continue as a business, people will still fill the place up.  Which is a shame, because CFs can be quite good, when they're not failing at basic functions. Do yourselves a favor and walk over to many of the other almost as close options so this store can just end it already and give up the space to someone who will execute as if they care about their customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=140,3.28,3.39,3.39,2.5640000000000005,3.346

But, I looked a little harder at their novel of a menu and discovered their ""skinnylicious"" offerings. I question how some of these items (fried samosas, I'm looking at you!) are considered skinnylicious, but I'll let that go for now.  I ordered the Tuscan Chicken. The menu touts it as less than 590 calories. I wonder how many servings come on the plate though... It had 3 chicken breasts, for crying out loud! Anywho, I ate about half the plate and boxed the rest to go. It was tasty, with LOTS of oven roasted cherry tomatoes, capers, asparagus and artichoke. Expensive at $16.95 though!

Ever since she relocated to North Carolina that's all she's been talking about. I received two tickets to see ""The Space Between Us"" and decided to make the evening a girls night.  We grabbed dinner then had the most amazing cheesecake! We arrived around 5ish and sat near the bar. At first my niece was overwhelmed with the wide selection of cheesecake. She finally settled on the Oreo Cheesecake. I had the original with strawberries on top. Of course it was DELICIOUS!!!!  Our waitress Danielle was very patient and kind.  I've been to this location once before in college. My Mother Loves the food, I'm not a fan. Yes, the cheesecake is good, but the food lacks flavor. Maybe Im ordering the wrong thing.

52,Judith F.,"Fort Mill, SC",37,86,9.0,1.0,2017-02-05,"This used to be my absolute favorite go to restaurant for the last several years. Anytime we had a special occasion we have always gone to the cheesecake factory. My birthday is January 28 and we went there to eat Sunday the 29th. To give them credit it was an insanely busy day, but that was no excuse for the horrific tasting food that they put in front of me. I ordered the sweet corn tamales and I've never ordered anything else there because those are my absolute favorite things. The plate was scolding hot the food was stone cold it tasted horrible even my guests tasted it and couldn't believe how nasty it was. One of my friends ordered the cheeseburger with bacon on it and macaroni and cheese and ordered it medium-well... it came out about as raw as steak tartare!!!! They brought her burger then eventually they brought her bacon and even later they finally brought her fries. She ordered ranch dressing to go with her fries and it tasted awful. She's just a young girl and she was so embarrassed and thought she had done something wrong because her meals so bad that my insisted they take it off my tab. Her mother ordered the chicken Parmesan with carrots and mashed potatoes. She said it was actually quite good except that the carrots or better and not at all what she expected from the description on the menu.  All in all, we were there for four hours from the time we sit down at our table until the time that we finally were able to leave.  Our meal was handled so poorly by the manager that I decided to find a new favorite place for my birthday. This actually makes me quite sad, but I can always order takeout cheesecake, and I found a copycat recipe for my sweet corn tamales. So if I really want them that bad I'll make them myself. Our waitress was actually quite good, it just wasn't her fault that the food was coming out slowly and was not prepared correctly. She was delightful and really tried hard to keep us from getting out of sorts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=20,3.08,3.28,3.36,2.404,3.2000000000000006
42,Vince M.,"Charlotte, NC",7,206,431.0,5.0,2017-02-08,"Famous for its cheesecake and infamous for its two-hour waits, I must admit up front that I had no intention of liking this restaurant. I considered it to be over hyped and overrated; however, after a very satisfying early Saturday lunch, I now feel completely different. We arrived at 11:00AM and were seated immediately, fortunately in Melissa's section. We had a $50 gift card to play with. We started things off with a very tasty beet and goat cheese salad for $7.95. Fresh and warm honey wheat and sourdough loaves were also served and were very satisfying. For our entrees, my wife ordered the smoked salmon which was thinly sliced and doused with a balsamic glaze for $11.95, and I ordered the French country salad with chicken for $15.95. Both were quite good. We intentionally kept things light, knowing that we were each going to do some serious damage to cheesecake for dessert.  As an admitted dessert snob, I did have my doubts regardless of the fact that cheesecake was their specialty. I never consider any dessert unless it's made in house and most of the time they are not. After drooling over the choices on the menu and in the display case, we finally settled on the Oreo and the praline. Slices are huge and run a very reasonable $7.95 when compared to similar restaurants. More importantly, they were other worldly! The Oreo cheesecake had fresh crunchy Oreos baked in, an Oreo crust and was topped with crushed Oreos and fresh whipped cream. The praline was equally as good and was topped with Nutella and fresh creme. No we didn't finish them both but we sure did enjoy them there and at home. I am nonsmoker, and never have, but I almost had to have a cigarette afterwards. Yes it was that good! Hey what can I say, I was wrong. No wonder people wait 2 hours to dine here. I won't do that anywhere no matter how great but I will return for another 11:00 Saturday lunch. By the way, when we left at 1:00 there was a 2 hour wait. Overall, menu was huge, the food was great, the cheesecake incredible, service provided by Melissa was attentive and helpful, and the atmosphere was comfortable and fun. And on top of everything else, it had a 96 sanitary rating. There's no way I can give it anything but five stars!

Barely wiped tables/ seats and crumbs on the floor are too obvious for me to ignore.

At no point did she make any offers regarding our poorly prepared food. However, she gave the table next to is free cheesecake because they had the same issue.

Boy was that a wrong call especially since this is their slowest night! So I complete and pay for my order by 8:01 and was quoted 20 to 25 mins and waited until 8:42 at which point I asked the same take out cashier who had rang me up what was going on she replies waiting on fries and I said well you told me 20 to 25 she replies back I said 25 to 30 I said no but let's go with that then what's taking an extra 15 by the time that banter is done she had no answer except would you like me to get a manager and I replied yes that and the food you said would be ready within the 30 minutes that's now 45 so I wait for him ( Adrian) I believe was his name and after watching him deal with another customer to whole he gave a free slice of cheesecake because I'm guessing resolving yet another dissatisfied customer I unleash a flurry of choice words on their lack of customer service and kitchen performance because 2 hamburgers and a couple of salads do not take 1 hr worth of prepping because the prep boy that came in at 6am already chopped everything up and it's a matter of putting it all in a box. Meanwhile I have a viewership because I have become irate over the lack of concern as the store manager I believe Brandon to be was just watching with a blank stare and I ask him what's he doing and he states just listening to you didn't want to interrupt so I said you'll have to cause I'm long winded. Had nothing to offer so I had him go chase for his business card so I can call corporate or at least email them with first hand insight to their Monday night standards and hope they can improve on it. See the things that makes me so mad, irate or just blow my lid is unlike most people that complain I wasn't looking for ""free"" anything as I always reject such option. That's a band aid on an open wound. What I want is for you to take the time and go look into the issue and fix it and not give me this blank stare like you are surprised to see a customer so upset over a couple of burgers taking an hr to be made. Are you freaking kidding me! I've seen junior chefs make complete meals in an hr and yours can sling out some burgers in 30 mins. Time for training session or new cooks. They're a dime a dozen I'm guessing since it's not a restaurant where you have the liberty to make your menu as you go. Hope this helps you Brandon with what the issue was and you jump on it and get it taken care of. I know it's not the first time service has been lack luster and that's putting it mildly!

The hostess was less than helpful and gave us a pager to wait like the other 25 parties there! Dissatisfied, I grabbed a manager who was gracious enough to rectify the situation.  Our waitress was kind and pretty attentive. Our entree selections included shepherd's pie, shrimp scampi without tomatoes that arrived with tomatoes, kids' pizza and a Cuban sandwich. Everything tasted ok. If you do have the shrimp pasta, know that it comes with five shrimp, not many noodles and barely any ""sauce"". Oh and we did have a good appetizer, the buffalo blasts!

51,Angelia L.,"Newton, NC",0,16,6.0,3.0,2017-07-01,"I've had Cheesecake Factory many times and each time I think the food is average. It's way overpriced for the quality served. Today I got the fish tacos, $15. The presentation looks great but the I could taste everything but the fish. The fish was unfortunately bland. I've had better for a lot cheaper at food trucks. I think everything on the menu is way overpriced and there are just way too many items to choose from.  I think the cheesecakes are worth the money, they are delicious, but the actual food is really not. I'd enjoy the experience more if it wasn't so pricey. I usually don't dine here but a friend of mine wanted to for the cheesecake.  The service is so so. Our waiter smelt of cigarettes which was a super buzz kill and really unappealing because we were about to eat. He came and went really quickly just to take our orders and serve the food but we never got a refill. We hardly saw him. I'd also like to mention that the floor is always slippery at every Cheesecake Factory I've ever been too and this one is no exception.

When you immediately start fidgeting with your computer screen punching in buttons with a stressed frown on your face, thankful our parents who have never been to Cheesecake Factory didn't have to endure this rude greeting.  Next, it's on to the bar for a couple glasses of wine and a virgin daquiri (we told the bartender before we ordered we would make it worth his while :)  -- expected that to get a little friendly response.  No instead an abrupt stomp off to make it.  Comes back we ask for a wine list and bartender seems annoyed we are not ordering food.  Ask about the house chardonnay and he tells me it""s compared to Beringer--blick!  That's a first!  So we get our wine and settle up immediately, we were going to hang out, but we felt very unwelcome here.  Decide to sit outside for the rest of our wait, the seating outside is really nice and it was a nice night.  Finally, the buzzer rings and it's on to dinner.  Waiter is pleasant enough but, seems frazzled and not overly friendly.  Takes our drink orders, brings them back with bread basket.  Takes our order and app order.   App comes out, probably good time to make sure everyone has drinks still... nope.  He disappears then, apparently at this restaurant there are no food runners so, the waiter is also responsible for getting your food out to you too.  Seems like a BIG mistake to me--unless your organized and a good waiter/waitress.   We were a party of 6 and like I said first time our parents had ever been here and we were hoping to treat them to a good evening.  So half of our party got our food right away, the other half waited and waited (typically at most restaurants when food comes out seperate like that it is expected that the rest of the tables food is coming up right?).  We saw our waiter take another order, before he got the rest of our food.  No checkback really, and definitely no drink refills, unless  you count the time I flagged him down.  When our waiter finally came back to the table, ingredients from my salad were missing, had to get waiter to go ask for those items.   Like I said food was good enough and cheesecake was awesome, but for what you pay to eat at this place and the wait, you expect better service!  There are a ton of great restaurants in our area and for us this is not one we will be in a hurry to return to.  Best part, we also get the impression that the people who work there don't really care if you come back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=80,3.24,3.19,3.316,3.1160000000000005,3.21

Several times our servers have informed us on options that we were not previously aware of such as paying our bill through the iPhone App, new available Cheesecake options, and even pointing us to the bar for their happy hour specials.  I would give this location a five star rating but there is one issue I have, consistency. The last couple of times we have gone to do the happy hour in the bar area, our apps that were ordered were different in taste each time. My favorite app are the potstickers, but I ordered them three times and all three time they were different. One time they were overdone, next time they were overloaded with the sauce, third time they were near perfect.  Same type of deal has happened with entrees ordered where one time my meatloaf was dry and the next time was slightly undercooked.

I had the pleasure of taking my entire family (wife and 5 children - 14, 10, 10, 7, 5) plus a 6 yo friend of my 7 yo daughter to eat at CF for my 7 year old's birthday dinner. I realize it was 7pm on a Wed night (not a weekend night), but it was still busy. So - it was crazy, to say the least - loud, annoying, yelling, constant battles between the boys, unnecessary comments and touching, eye rolls and sighs...you know the drill. But CF and my server were FANTASTIC and handled it all with serious grace and professionalism.  Look - the food at CF is good. Very good. Yes, the Factory Burrito is flippin huge and enough for an entire village to eat. Yes, their cheesecakes are absurdly large and delish. Yes, their menu is a bit overpriced, especially some of the kids' meals. But it is truly hard to complain due to the quality of the food. But my issues with CF in the past have almost entirely been about service. Not THIS time, however.  I got there early to get a table (b/c they still have that stupid ""no reservation"" rule, ugh). The Hostess was very nice and went out of her way to help, even making sure my name stayed at the top of the list while I waited for my family to arrive (2 cars). We were settled into a large, round booth-thing. ONE SERIOUS ISSUE - the booth's seat fabric was TERRIBLE. It was literally missing in multiple places with stuffing popping out. Unreal. It wasn't uncomfortable or anything, just VERY ugly and not what I expect for Southpark and the prices they charge. Anyway - our server was amazing. She was constantly there, getting constant refills for my camel-like kids, never getting upset about all the yelling and things being spilled. She got our food out ASAP and was always (somehow) happy to help us with the (stupidest) requests from my children (including needing crayons to color - which she somehow found - and paper). I honestly cannot say enough about her and the rest of the staff there.

345,Rebekah K.,"Charlotte, NC",121,81,182.0,4.0,2017-09-28,"The best thing about the Cheesecake Factory (besides all the Cheesecake) is that their menu is so expansive and there really is something for everyone to eat there. This was only my second time there but every time I have the hardest time picking out what to get because I want to pick more than one!  We started with Buffalo Blasts as an appetizer and they come with 8 giant pieces! I was shocked when I saw the amount! They're basically fried Buffalo chicken dip and man were they good! With all the food that was yet to come, we probably didn't need to get them, but I'm still glad we did.  My boyfriend and I each got a pasta dish which were very generous portions and both were very very good. My only complaint about the entire experience is that I could tell that my pasta was sitting out for a little while, so I guess we were waiting on my boyfriends meal before they could serve it to our table. It was still good and pasta is always a good leftover choice.  Of course we ended the meal with Cheesecake. We decided to split one and got the cookie dough cheesecake. It was so so so good. In the words of my boyfriend ""I'm glad I've had plain cheesecake before this or I would expect all Cheesecake to taste just like this"". It tasted exactly like cookie dough.  I would definitely come here again. It can definitely get pricy as their menu is so large and you just want everything, but maybe more frequent trips would make me feel like I can just pick one thing at a time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte,3.52,3.22,3.344,2.544,3.3400000000000007

When reported to the server she replied that ""they won't do anything because there's less than half left"" She, herself realized this was a ridiculous statement as demonstrated when she nervously glanced at the plate which was 95% full and only a couple of bites taken. She had already passed by the table a couple of times, glanced at his plate and never once asked if his meal was ok. I ordered the same entree and also had undercooked meat but less so than my husband, however even though there was also a good portion of my meal remaining she did not ask how mine was and if I was satisfied. She proceeded to ask if we wanted dessert, then brought the dessert before clearing the dinner plates, and without fresh utensils or napkins.  We'd have requested a manager on the spot but we were in with our daughter who is only home for the weekend and we chose to try and enjoy the remainder of the meal with her.

I'll probably stop by and get a slice of cheesecake but that's all.  My waitress kept forgetting about us(my daughter and I). I ordered a burger and added mozzarella cheese. My burger was supposed to come with fries but I never received my fries. My waitress later apologized and offered to boxed them up so I can take them to go. She later returned with the bill and NO fries stating that the cost of the mozzarella cheese ($1.50) was removed from my bill instead. She placed the bill on the table and walked away. About 10 -15 mins went by and I was still waiting to pay my bill. I got impatient and walked to the bar area near the patio to pay. At first the waitress standing there was hesitant to to process my bill but I explained what was going on she processed it and walked away. I could have walked out without paying or without leaving a tip but that's not me.

You expect consistency and at least passable quality when going to a chain establishment, but not the case here at this location. Wednesday night last week stopped in for a late dinner (9PM) after a long day. The server was great very attentive, but unfortunately the same couldn't be said about the kitchen. Ordered Thai Lettuce Wraps  and my friend ordered a burger - one hour in an empty restaurant to grill some chicken - and plate it with lettuce. Kind of crazy, no apology from the waiter on the wait.  Food finally came out - there were three chicken pieces on the plate - 3 about the size of two of my fingers side by side. - $14 for that? Sauce was missing from the plate and the lettuce was rotting. I wish I would have stopped to talk to a manager, but after a long day all I wanted was to eat and go home especially after an hour wait in a basically empty restaurant.

What made me love this place more besides the delicious food was that the manager (forgot his name) brought out my plate personally and stated it was totally shellfish free. I really appreciate the fact that he took the time to bring my plate out and acknowledge my special needs. We joked around and he was very nice and accommodating. He was awesome!  Now on to the food. I love coffee so I know good coffee when I taste it and their caramel macchiato was amazing. The fish tacos were really good and omg the Mac n chz are a must Have!

She informed me that ""policy"" said we could not be seated because all 6 of us were not there. Two were at the bar closing out our check and one was in the mall because as a 73 year old, he needed to sit. YOU do not have anywhere near the seating needed for waiting guests. Are you kidding? Do you really expect everyone to be there immediately upon beeping after three long hours? My lord, I wonder why the fire marshals have not ordered you to clear the doorway of scores of people waiting to be seated. Your food staff had huge difficulty navigating the immense crowd. Think guest safety. When Saturday night crowds are big and it is 10 degrees outside, perhaps you can isolate a better waiting area. Everything about The Cheesecake Factory gets high marks but not your corporate policies or customer accommodation  (therefore the 2 stars as an average for food vs. ""policy"").
