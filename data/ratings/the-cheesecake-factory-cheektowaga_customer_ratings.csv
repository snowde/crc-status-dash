221,Jen L.,"Lockport, NY",85,228,22.0,2.0,2012-02-22,"The food is very average. I mean, in a pinch it works. It's food and they really have something for everyone. The menu is something like 20-pages long. They've got pasta, burgers, sandwiches, some kind of tex-mex items, omelets, salads, etc. Lots of cheesecake which is not the best cheesecake I've ever had. The one REALLY crazycakes thing about this place is the wait time. I know it's the mall but a three-hour wait for a table at dinnertime on Saturday? What? We were smart enough to put in our names and go shop for a bit (only a 90 minute wait when we arrived but it was three hours when we left) but the sad, noisy masses standing about waiting to be seated was painful. Like stepping on my feet and ramming into my back painful.

129,Jeff S.,"Charlotte, NC",189,1358,2434.0,3.0,2012-04-29,"I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory to eat other than cheesecake until last week and at this restaurant. While I think the decor at this place is over the top and a bit childish, the food was actually decent.  I had the chicken tostada salad which is a southwestern style salad and it is HUGEEEEE.  I was wondering If I was going to need 3 stomachs to fit it in.  The salad was delicious but it was missing corn that the menu said it came with. Also, the service, while our waiter was attentive, he wasn't especially efficient.  For example he screwed up on drinks often pepsi instead of tea and regular pepsi instead of diet.   The cheesecake is definitely the best part here but I just had the original cheesecake and it too was flawed a little...it should have been left to set a little more because it was almost like half melted butter when it arrived to the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cheektowaga?start=160,2.92,2.92,2.92,3.0520000000000005,2.92
273,Kimberley N.,"Mississauga, Canada",111,364,110.0,4.0,2012-05-21,"Every time my family and I head to the states we always drop by The Cheesecake Factory. Usually there's always a long wait during the dinner time rush but since we got here for lunch we were seated promptly. The interior of all Cheesecake Factories are huge like a ""factory"", actually not THAT big but it's pretty big for a restaurant. We decided to have lunch out on the patio because of the nice weather. Although it was sunny the patio had lots of shade which was great. We started off with buffalo wings as the appetizer and my sister and I got a strawberry daiquiri. Why not pretend we're in a tropical hot place by having a nice tropical drink? For the main course, my dad and I got the original hamburger, my mom got the grilled salmon, and my sister got the shrimp in angel hair. While we waited our server dropped off a basket of bread which was warm and yummy. The food didn't take long to arrive which was another plus. No one finished their meal besides my mom. My dad and I only finished half of the burger and barely even touched the fries because we were so stuffed. My sister's plate looked like it hasn't even been touched because she was also stuffed. We took everything home and had it for dinner. The total came out to around $80 (including tip) which is pretty decent for a family of 4.

138,Jeruen D.,"Berlin, Germany",35,1135,796.0,2.0,2012-06-15,"I think this restaurant has it wrong. And I don't understand why they still have a fanbase, and is usually packed during dinner time during the weekends.  So I was here with 3 other people, 2 of them not having lunch yet, at around 2 PM. One ordered the Cobb salad, while the other ordered a white tomato pizza. I on the other hand just split a cheesecake.  Don't get me wrong, the food tasted good, but they just do things I think are wrong, that I am giving them just 2 stars.  First, let me talk about the quantity. Why does the Cobb salad look like it's a salad for 3 people? It's this big mountain of chopped greenery on a plate. And the cheesecake, well, the cake per se tasted good, but it just came with two large mounds of whipped cream. Does the Cheesecake Factory have a goal of fattening every customer?  I'd rather have them serve smaller and cheaper portions. Seriously, why would one want to eat that much Cobb salad? I don't know, but I think that if they reduced portions and removed the unnecessary things (like the whipped cream, for example), then they'd rub me better. I don't mind their cheesecakes, but things are just so gaudy that the substance gets lost in the process.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cheektowaga?start=160,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.9200000000000004,3.0000000000000004

Sometimes I think I just go down to Buffalo in order to just go to the Cheesecake Factory....Sometimes I'm right. I love the Avocado Springrolls and the BBQ Salmon. I also enjoy getting their Grilled Ahi Tuna with Edemame. My only problem that I have when I get there is that I eat WAY too much in order to justify cheesecake for dessert at the end of the meal which is the main reason why I go. The staff tends to consistently be running about and they talk QUICK which can lead to poor service. However, the food in my honest opinion makes up for a lot of this.

136,Fox E.,"Buffalo, NY",3671,4883,17405.0,3.0,2012-07-02,"There's nothing appetizing about a factory, perhaps if it was called the Cheapskate Factory or the Cheapfake Factory, selling bargain imitation goods at knock down prices, it might work out, but as a place for gourmet desserts, it just doesn't work. And it's anything but Cheapskate... it's one of the most overpriced places in the area. If this were the Beefsteak Factory, they would manufacture Tomatoes... really big and unusually expensive ones. But it's not, so they don't. I'm not sure who thought that ""Factory"" was an appetizing word to include in eateries, but it's not. (And yes, Spaghetti Factory, and Spaghetti Warehouse for that matter... I am looking squarely at you). For that matter, Doughnut Plant in NYC should have a re-think. The plant, the factory, the warehouse... not sexy. Not appetizing. Not making me hungry. Holy high prices, Batman. I already don't like chains, but the prices here are beyond insane. $7 for a slice of cheesecake? Exsqueeze me? Are you cereal? Honestly I had no idea. I ate at one of these in Fairfax VA recently, and I thought the food was okay and the milkshake was heavenly (Dulce De Leche Milkshake, no less). But the pricing is just... off the charts insane. I am not a fan. I can't give this chain the maximum possible 3 (or even 4) while they have sky high obnoxious prices like this. Now they don't have the DDL milkshake anymore (replaced it with Oreo, boo), but what they do have is a tropical smoothie with a blend of lots of different juices, and as much as I generally don't like smoothies, I have to say this one was really good, I enjoyed it. However it better be good considering it was a SEVEN DOLLAR DRINK and was really small, not even medium or large. :( I tried their cheesecake, and I find it average to be honest, but even if you like it, $7 a slice? I can get S & S Cheesecake - NYC's best - for $3 a slice, in the Bronx. So it just makes no sense for a national corporate chain that would be making a killing even if they charged $2 a slice, to charge $7. Their food is average too, I've tried 3 or 4 dishes from here (grilled chicken, burger, you name it), it's never particularly amazing but is always amazingly overpriced. The service is really great though. The loveliest girl works here, and she alone is the reason why they get a nice healthy 3/5. She is like, the friendliest and sweetest girl ever. And has a great memory. And I hope her finger feels better. No I didn't do anything to her finger you sick people. 5 star for the drinks 5 star for the service 3 star for the cheesecake 3 star for the food 1 star for the prices I'd give minus 100 stars for the prices if I could",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cheektowaga?start=160,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.9240000000000004,2.88
224,J Y.,"Toronto, Canada",0,38,,4.0,2012-07-09,"My second time here wasn't as great as the first, but it was still a good experience. I ordered their frozen iced mango drink. I like mango drinks, but this time around there was too much raspberry for my liking. It was still pretty good though. Their Hibachi Steak was delicious! I personally liked this more than the Chicken Madeira I ordered last time. Portions were relatively small, which is fine for me because it's still a filling size for an average sized person.  Unfortunately, service wasn't as good as before. It's probably because our waiter was on break at the time and his area was being covered by two other people, so we had three servers that evening and somewhat inconsistent service. It wasn't too bad, but my first time there was pretty dang amazing, so I was expecting that again. Food is still good though, and portions are large enough for a lot of people to ask for take-out plates.  Oh, and the downside of this place was that we had to wait over an hour to be seated. But since we were inside a mall around the time when people were leaving (though the stores were still open), it wasn't too bad of a wait =).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cheektowaga?start=260,2.88,2.88,2.88,3.024,2.88

257,Dakota P.,"Ottawa, Canada",0,61,21.0,4.0,2012-08-07,"Even though there was a 40 minute wait for a table on a Monday night at 8PM, my friend insisted that we go try the cheesecake factory. I thought to myself, why not? Boy was I glad.  Their strawberry cheesecake was heaven in my mouth. I admit, it is overpriced (about $8 for a slice), but when you are at a restaurant called the cheesecake factory, it's a given you're gonna try a slice.  For dinner I had the salmon and steak combination which also came with a large helping of mashed potatos. The steak was perfect, it came just the way I asked it to be. However, some might not like that they chop our steak for you, so let them know in advance if you don't like people touching your steak.  Both my friend and I were beyond stuffed.  The service is ok. The waitress we had tried to convice us to order more, but it was a good thing we didn't because we couldn't even finish what we ordered. Our food arrived quite promptly even though the restaurant was crazy packed. Our bread basket came right after we took our orders. Bread was fresh and moist.  Even though we were only just starting our cheesecake, our waitress started taking plates off our tables and gave us our bill. I was a little annoyed by this, but I guess you can't really blame them as they were crazy packed.  I will definately come back again as a treat even if it's just for cheesecake. Whole cheesecakes are available for sale but they require 2 hours to defrost.

The quality is pretty decent, nothing super like alan wong's in Honnolulu (but its at least 2 times the price there) but I mean it seems like a decent go to joint.  The cheesecake is definitely a highlight of the place and many of them are decent but I think our favorite is the Banana Creme.

And on my most recent visit, I was impressed with the new ""skinnylicious"" menu they offer. Since Cheesecake Factory is known for their huge, high calorie menu items, the skinny menu is a nice offering. I ordered the Tuna Tartare and Asian lettuce wraps. Had a glass of the Skinny Sangria too. All were tasty, though the tuna portion was SUPER small. Meh. I'm trying to eat better anyway. I split a piece of the mango key lime cheesecake among a few of us ladies and it was AMAZING. Light and fluffy, very mango-y, with an awesome coconut macaroon crust. Definitely yum.  I've never had a meal here that I didn't like. The menu is HUGE so there is literally something for EVERYONE. For a chain it's perfectly acceptable.

As a Canadian we don't have this have this chain on our side of the boarder so I knew this would be my lunch time stop. A Sunday afternoon just around 4pm it was a 20 minute wait, by the time our table was ready the wait time had upped to 40-50 minutes. I literally spent the whole 20 minutes drooling in front of the beautiful array of cheesecakes in the display case. The menu is huge its more, there is literally something for everyone with all types of dishes and cuisines. To start we went our waiter's recommendation Fried Mac and Cheese - Crispy Crumb Coated Macaroni and Cheese Balls. Served over a Creamy Marinara Sauce Super crispy batter revealing a creamy interior of white cheddar mac & cheese. Gooey piping hot with a creamy marinara sauce, a sinfully delicious start. For mains the Fiancee went with the Pizza & Salad Lunch Special He got the pepperoni pizza and a Caesar salad. It was supposedly a lunch sized portion however both looked normal if not large in size to us. I went with the White Chicken Chili - A Generous Bowl of Chicken, White Beans, Roasted Green Chiles, Onions and Garlic with a Touch of Cream. Garnished with Steamed Rice and Fresh Salsa I liked that they gave the option of white or brown rice. Being a fan of chili this was the first time I had ever had a white chili and it did not disappoint. The chili was really flavorful and filling with a good amount of heat. Delicious rich and creamier than traditional chili. And then finally we get to Dessert! After my 20 minutes spent staring at the display case and being a PB lover I knew exactly which one I wanted. Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cheesecake - Chunks of Reese's® Peanut Butter Cups in our Original Cheesecake with Layers of Delicious Fudge Cake and Caramel OMG Let me tell you words can't describe how delicious this was! They really do know how to do a cheesecake justice, this cake alone would make me drive from Toronto to Buffalo. Creamy chocolatey peanut buttery oooo man I don't even like cheesecake but I LOVED this cake. And the portion is Hugeeee I wish I had another stomach so I could of finished it. Overall Service was a little hit or miss, Our waiter forgot to bring us bread and we had to keep calling him over to refill our drinks but he was friendly and funny none the less and the place was overwhelmingly busy.

They don't take reservations, but believe me, these guys were amazing to make sure they kept an eye out for us. No promises but they still kept us in mind so when my party showed up, we were immediately seated and had a pretty good experience. The menu has lighted up a great deal. There were several dinner option for under 500 calories that did not skip out on taste. Our server was attentive as was everyone else that came to our table. Everyone was happy with their meals and the bill was divided for us at the end even though we didn't request it from the beginning. That's always a plus in my book. Well who goes to TCF on a diet? You really can't, especially when there's tons of yummy cheesecake to be had.

These restaurants are usually packed because there cheesecakes (and food overall) are by far the best ( buttery, not in flavour but in texture) that I have tried and I've tried all kinds of expensive cheesecake that have all been subpar compared to these. Their menu is huge and offers a wide range of options. I constantly find myself shaking my head at some of the negative reviews..

Everything I've tried at this restaurant has been great from fish to steak Diane to chicken etc. try the red velvet cake or Kahlua cheesecake ..

With it's huge portions you should come prepared to take home left overs however they have now added a ""Skinnylicious"" menu with items that a low calorie compared to their normal dishes. With the opportunity of having visited various Cheesecake Factories I have had the ability to sample many dishes. Favorites of my friends or myself start with the appetizer of the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps. I find them light enough to start out a meal as they do not leave you feeling full such as the bread that is put out on the table. Another favorite from the starters are the Buffalo Blasts. The filling is good for anyone that wants the Buffalo wing taste but doesn't want to go through the hassle of the actual wing however at times they can come out greasy as I believe they are deep fried. Some of my favorite main dishes are the BBQ Chicken Pizza, the Navajo; a chicken sandwich served on warm fry-bread and the Cuban Sandwich. For anyone that is looking for a hearty sandwich with both pork and ham it comes in a closed second from other versions I've had at actual Cuban restaurants. If you are looking for a cheesecake that is still rich but not excessively sweet I recommend the Pineapple Upside-Down Cheesecake.

After the drinks arrive, the waitress took our orders for apps and main entrees. I ordered the pasta with meat sauce and my friend ordered the pasta da Vinci. The fresh bread came a little bit after we ordered. The bread tasted average and did not impress. There was whole wheat bread and plain white bread. Butter was served as the sauce or spread. The food is taking a long time to arrive. The waitress started to talk to us about a game called Candy Crush after she saw my friend playing the game. She started to help my friend beat a level but fails. (I don't know if this is exactly part of the restaurant experience). Moments after this, our food arrived. The pasta with meat sauce was a disappointment. The noodles were dry and over-salted. My friend said the pasta da Vinci tasted average. The noodles were dry and the sauce was too oily. After eating our mains, we ordered our desserts. I ordered the mango keylime cheesecake and my friend ordered the smores cheesecake.  The mango keylime cheesecake tasted amazing. My friend said the smores cheesecake tasted delicious. Overall, Cheesecake Factory met some of my expectations. The cheese cake was amazing but the main entrees were disappointing for me. The service was okay. For me, the waitress helping my friend beat a level on his phone is poor service. But this is my subjective opinion. My friend thought she was cool (maybe I'm too serious). Also, the décor was amazing. I would recommend this restaurant for everyone looking for great desserts to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cheektowaga?start=180,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.1160000000000005,3.3200000000000003

245,Jody G.,"Buffalo, NY",154,745,201.0,4.0,2013-08-25,"Yeah...Yeah.... I KNOW it's a chain restaurant.  And, yup...I'm not particularly into chain restaurants..... but it's so darn popular (still, after years of being in the ""Galleria"", people wait and wait with buzzers in hand for a table) that I was quite curious to see what all the hype was about.  So, when I was offered a dinner out for my almost-birthday this seemed like the perfect place to almost-celebrate. We joined the queue, were told that it was a 10-15 minute wait, and received our buzzer.  We headed to the bar to order a pre-meal drink.  Now this place has a MAJOR menu!  Like pages and pages and pages.  There are even a few ads in it (seriously!!) so the reader can take a little break from reading and think about shopping.  We are in a mall after-all.  SO MANY choices!  I was baffled even by the many, many drinks.  I decided to step out of my comfort zone of ordering wine and go with a cocktail.  I chose the ""Factory Peach Bellini"" (Champagne, Peaches and Peach Liqueur all Blended to an Icy Smoothness) which was tasty and refreshing, but a bit too sweet for me.   After about 20 minutes our table was ready.  (Not bad)  The seating process was a bit confusing.... our buzzer was  taken and then we had to wait on another short line to be seated.  But, the people working there seemed to have it all under control.  We were part of a well oiled machine.  All policies and procedures were being followed.  Once seated (long row of bench seats with little space between the tables) I realized how huge and loud this place is.  And, there were a few too many whiny kids (Sorry, mine are now grown and know not to eat pasta with their fingers and throw crayons on the floor ..... so I've become one of ""those"").  The waitress was friendly and efficient though. I once again searched the menu... probably with that ""deer in the headlights"" look on my face.  TOO MANY CHOICES!  Did I want a salad, a sandwich, pasta, chicken, fish, small plates, large plates, pizza, Asian food, Mexican food, Moroccan food (seriously)? Luckily my dining companion (who knows what I like) spied and suggested the ""Crispy Chicken Costoletta"" (Chicken Breast Lightly Breaded and Sautéed to a Crisp Golden Brown. Served with Lemon Sauce, Mashed Potatoes and Fresh Asparagus). I ordered it and honestly couldn't have been more pleased.  That dish was AMAZING!  Three (!!!) chicken breast halves (I brought two home for another meal) were pounded fresh and cooked perfectly.  And, the accompanying side dishes were cooked just right.  The red skin (on) smashed potatoes were perfectly seasoned and had just the right amount of lumpiness.... and the asparagus was steamed to a delightful tender crunch.  And the lemon sauce was light, yet flavorful and drizzled on my plate with what appeared to be a loving and competent hand... not too much.... not too little.... just right! My dining companion loved his ""Cajun Jambalaya Pasta"" (Shrimp and Chicken Sautéed with Onions, Tomato and Peppers in a Very Spicy Cajun Sauce. All on Top of Fresh Linguine).  I had a forkful and it was fresh, spicy, and delicious.  And (I almost forgot) the bread that was brought to the table (mini loaves of white and honey wheat) were so good that I was tempted to throw the leftovers in my purse (but alas, I controlled myself). For dessert we simply HAD to try some cheesecake (ummm....this is ""The Cheesecake Factory"" after-all).  Again, SO MANY choices!  Over thirty kinds!!! Everything from regular... to cookie dough... to pina colada... to chocolate... to pineapple upside-down... to creme brulee... to Kahlua... to peppermint bark...  Being ""purists"" we opted for one slice of ""Original with Fresh Strawberries"" with two forks.  It was THE BEST cheesecake I've ever had in a restaurant.  Perfect density, wonderful graham cracker crust, huge ripe strawberries, and a garnish of real (!!!) whipped cream... it was just the right size for sharing... and a perfect ending to a (surprisingly) delicious meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cheektowaga?start=220,3.48,3.48,3.48,3.2800000000000002,3.4800000000000004

First off, we reserved our seats at 8:50pm and there was 40 min waiting time (this place is always crowded). No I am not complaining about the wait. But when the buzzed our beeper for our turn, they made us wait another 10 min, in an already croweded restaurent just to be seated. I mean if you are not really ready, why the hell call your customer.  2. One person directs you to your seat, another one takes your order and another one serves you. I couldn't figure out who exactly was my server since nobody cared to mention that! 3. During our entire dinner, we weren't asked if we liked the food, would like to order anything else or even asked for more water/bevarages. Really!? 4. We requested 4 people, not at all exagerrating, for our check! 5. They also have a bakery and we ordered two cheesecakes to go from there. The cashier had some problems with the payment terminal and took the anger on my card. Cashier swiped my card so hard so many times. I am afraid my card is now damaged.

222,Danielle K.,"Buffalo, NY",6,10,8.0,1.0,2013-09-10,"We arrived around 5:30 P.M. and, to our chagrin, it was packed. All the seats we were able to see were full, and there were a few parties in front of us obviously waiting to be seated. Shockingly, we were seated within ten minutes, as we admired how nice the interior of the restaurant was. Though being greeted by a cheerful individual at the front door, there was also a din of pop hits that we had to verbally compete with the entire night. Not particularly enjoyable, but there are few exceptions in the realm of dining establishments where you won't find that. In such a beautiful atmosphere, full of people of all ages, you'd expect the food to be quite impressive. The menu itself was thick enough to be a short novel. Paging through it, you come to the conclusion this is one of those restaurants that, instead of specializing in one or two types of cuisine and doing them very well, they attempt to do it all. Thai (and tons of Asian fusion dishes), Italian, Mexican, classic American, Greek, breakfast, lunch specials, dinner, and of course dessert. Everything from Orange Chicken to Shepherd's Pie, White Bean Hummus to Fettuccini Alfredo, Very overwhelming. Shortly after we received our drinks, we were given a stingy basket of moderately fresh bread, which was never offered to be refilled. After a long debate on what we were going to order, it was decided. My ex-boyfriend ordered the 'Smokehouse B.B.Q. Burger' ($11); my mother not being particularly starving ordered a cup of their soup of the day, which turned out to be 'Mexican Chicken Tortilla' ($5) and one of what they consider their Small Plates and Snacks, the 'Wild Mushroom Flatbread' ($6). I, being the large fan of seafood that I am, settled on the 'Wasabi Crusted Ahi Tuna' ($21). Our waitress disappeared, and so began the half-an-hour wait for our entrees (along with my mother's soup, which she would've liked sooner). As we waited for our own food to arrive, we witnessed plate after plate being served to those (too close for comfort) around us being served giant portions of food--most of which we couldn't identify. A woman sitting across from us was in the process of eating a salad that could've fed three or four people, and she let their waitress take it away when 3/4 of it remained in the bowl. Huge plates of gelatinous slop that we guessed were to be Chicken and Biscuits or something covered in a white gravy seemed to be rather popular--portions that the average human being could never choke down in one sitting unless they'd been starved for an extended period of time, especially as they weren't particularly appetizing looking. My ex-better half's hamburger was the highlight of the evening, and, with me being a pescetarian, saying that is quite disturbing, though in comparison to what we'd previously seen, it was a surprisingly small portion of food. His burger, cooked perfectly medium, was piled high with onion rings, bacon, barbecue sauce, and what he thought was cabbage that was shredded. My mother's soup was more like a rice casserole, with a small amount of broth, which happens to be her favorite aspect of soup. She sent it back, and received a bowl almost identical, though in this bowl there were a large amount of unpeeled carrots that she unhappily pointed out to our waitress, who later comped it from our bill. The Wild Mushroom Flatbread was actually quite good and, if it were bigger, we might even return for it. My tuna was fairly disappointing, though it was also cooked perfectly rare and was a beautiful piece of fish. The 'crust' was soggy and tasteless, with the consistency of a grated sponge. And for something claiming to have wasabi as an ingredient, I expected to experience a tingle in my nose: something spicy! It sat on a bed of inconsistently cooked white rice, which was surrounded by an overcooked shredded sea of carrot, zucchini, and other unidentifiable, tasteless vegetables. The menu claimed that the liquid was miso flavored, but it could've passed for a bland butter sauce. Finally having her remove those plates from our table was no big loss. Seeing as we were at the Cheesecake Factory, it only seemed right to get dessert, though my mother didn't agree. I ordered a cup of coffee and the 'Snickers Bar Chunks and Cheesecake', and my ex-better half ordered the cherry cheesecake. There were no pieces of actual Snickers baked into it, as the menu told us, and the bottom was mysteriously soggy--though somehow it still tasted all right. My ex-boyfriend enjoyed his with no complaints, and their coffee was quite good. Overall, I don't think we'll be returning, because we are more for quality over quantity, and not the other way around. This 'factory' seems as though its main focus is cranking out huge portions of food to convince the customer that they're getting a lot for their money; it just isn't particularly good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cheektowaga?start=260,3.36,3.36,3.36,3.0120000000000005,3.3600000000000003

250,Yvonne T.,"Toronto, Canada",123,599,1794.0,3.0,2013-10-03,"When I'm in the U.S. I'm always looking to eat at places that I can't normally find in Canada.  If you can endure the wait (we had to wait an hour) then you'll be fine.  We were so hungry that we went to the takeout counter and had a slice of cheesecake until our buzzer went off.   The cheesecake isn't cheap here.  Almost $8 for a slice.  And while it is better than your standard grocery store stuff, I don't see what all the hype is about other than ""you can't get it in Canada.""  Maybe it's the sheer variety of flavours available (everything from original, to mango key lime to chocolate raspberry... and for the dieters, there's even a low-fat option). The place itself is actually quite massive and the menu is quite large as well. Since it was already quite late in the evening, we didn't have a huge dinner.  We were just glad to sit down and get something into our stomachs after a 6-hour day at the outlet mall. We ate: Chicken + Shrimp Gumbo --  Nothing fancy and the shrimps are tiny tiny, but you do get quite a few of them.  Great flavors.  And it's awesome that you can opt for brown rice, though it does zap up the sauce quite quickly. Pulled Pork Sandwich -- Served on a brioche bun.  Very saucy and the pork was extremely tender, but the brioche bun could not stand up to the saucy filling and got quite soggy.  I also found the pulled pork to be wayyyyyyyyy too sweet (and that's saying a lot coming from me).  Mom subbed regular fries with sweet potato fries for an extra $1.  The fries need some work. We also opted for the Buffalo Wings (when in Buffalo....) I don't know if it's just me, but I find the wings in the U.S. to be a lot meatier than the wings in Canada!  This came with the standard celery sticks and blue cheese sauce.  Quite good. So I tried it and it was okay.  Service was quite good (though I find service in the U.S. to generally be better than Canada).  Nothing was particularly bad, but nothing was particularly good.  I actually think I prefer Jack Astor's more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cheektowaga?start=220,3.28,3.28,3.28,3.372,3.2800000000000002

Never once have they got an order wrong. Never once was our food not perfect. it's one of the few chains in Buffalo where you get what you pay for.  I ate here again tonight and the restaurant showed it's true colors. You can tell a lot about a place by how they treat a customer when they walk in at 10:35 on a Tuesday night, 25 minutes before closing time, and it's been a slow night. Fortunately, they treated me no different than if I walked in at 7. I received top-notch service, wasn't rushed to leave when they closed and my food was hot, tasty and downright perfect.  I tried something new on this visit (I've had most of the menu at one location or another over the years) and went with the Jamaican shrimp. It was excellent.

265,Jill C.,"North York, Canada",124,278,358.0,2.0,2014-03-11,"The service at the Cheesecake Factory just keeps getting worse and worse! What keeps me coming back is that I do not come here often and sometimes you just want a slice of cheesecake.. The first time I came here, we asked about the beef ribs which they do have on the menu anymore and the waitress responded by saying she does not eat mammals. That was one of the strangest replies I have ever encountered! I have no issues if you do not eat meat, but the way she responded was a little odd, and then when we returned them because they were unedible and the reason they didn't last on the menu she looked like she was going to kill us. If you do not eat meat and have a problem serving it, why work in a restaurant that offers it? Needless to say, she didn't make it as a waitress, at least at the Cheesecake Factory. There is always a wait here, be prepared to wait up to an hour, luckily it is located inside the mall so you can shop a little while waiting for a table. I have no problem waiting, and they do usually seat you at a reasonable wait time.  On our most recent visit we ordered a steak and a pasta, big mistake! The pasta was long made and sitting under the heat lamp waiting for the steak to be cooked. Also they automatically butterfly the steak unless you tell them not too. I do not like my steak butterflied, I think it ruins the steak!  The pasta was all dried up around the outside pieces and cold in the center, the waitress offered to stir it with more sauce, ummm no. How will they make the pasta better ? Obviously we returned it and just ended up sharing the steak, which was our original plan to share the pasta and the steak.  The manager did not bother to come over, we had to ask for him, and he was a DICK! Even our waitress agreed, I think the problem with this place is how the management is run. If you are not a people person, you should not have a job dealing with the public. He just kept saying he wouldn't charge for the pasta over and over, we returned it so why would we pay for something that was unacceptable?    The cheesecake is overpriced anyway, I think it is time to stop giving this place a chance to screw up again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cheektowaga?start=180,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.7280000000000006,3.5200000000000005

However. I will give this cheesecake factory 4 stars though for consistently meeting my expectations even when it is slammed (The Galleria Mall can get quite busy) If you have never been to The Cheesecake Factory, it is quite an interesting place. The lavish (Egyptian like?) columns and large size make it quite the sight, but the aura fades once you go a few times. The Menu is probably one of the most extensive I have ever seen. If you cant find something you like here, you should re-evaluate your eating habits. I highly recommend the Chinese Chicken Salad. Everytime I get this, people sitting around me ask me what it is (probably due to is size and presentation). It is HUGE! The secret is the plum dressing it is served with, i've never had anything quite like it. It can be kind of sweet though so if you are not into that, don't get it. I have been to The Cheesecake Factory many times in my life and will continue to go back. When I am at the mall and am looking for a sit down place with options for everybody.

The carrots were also not great, although I'm not really a fan of them to begin with, so I'll pass on that. We ordered cheesecake, and I tried the lemon raspberry flavor. That was some of the most delicious cheesecake I've ever tasted- and the only reason I can give the Cheesecake Factory 2/5 stars.

158,Lambert P.,"Toronto, Canada",387,1093,4867.0,4.0,2014-06-20,"Being from Toronto this is the closest Cheesecake Factory to town.  The thing about the Cheesecake Factory is if you've been to one, you've pretty much been to all of them because they have a standard and reputation they have to live up to. I've been to many Cheesecake Factories and I've been to the Buffalo location at least 4 times I think.  I've been to others such as Marina Del Rey, Pasadena, LA - The Grove, Aventura, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Jacksonville, Tyson's Corner off the top of my head and the one thing they have is that their standard across the board when it comes to the quality of their food. If you've never been to the Cheesecake Factory I think you need to believe the hype.  Their menu is a book.  Mind you half the pages are adds the thing is pretty much a 20+ page listing of craziness.  They do chicken something close to a dozen ways or more because it's so easy to lose count. Recently my favorite dish has been the hibachi steak.  It's basically a sweet soy medallion type steak pieces with onions and tempura asparagus with mash potatoes that have a hint of wasabi butter. My favorite cheese cake is the key lime pie cheesecake... they have so many rich cheesecakes to choose from you're bound to find one you will like.   Upon entry of the restaurant you can marvel at the deserts at the take out area where you can get up close and have a peek at what they look like.  You can order whole ones if they have them for take home as well. Basically the servings are huge, everything is large so mind the bread that comes early and if you're going to dare get an appetizer, share it because you're most likely going to be full with your main course and not have enough room for desert.  Remember you can always doggie bag your food so save room! There are so many items that are good that I remember having and some are no longer on the vast menu.  Another great item that comes to mind is the bang bang chicken... As far as chains go this is one of the better ones and they absolutely should come to Toronto and Canada in general.  Of course it would most likely be more expensive in Canada but many things are... I know most Cheesecake Factories do not take reservations on weekends but I think they do for particular holidays.  You're best to ask your local restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cheektowaga?start=80,3.8,3.8,3.8,2.768,3.8

The waitress suggested the natural strawberry cheesecake.  The strawberries were anything but natural, they were coated with a sugar syrup (maybe that is american natural). The cheesecake was more like a sugar cream or custard, not cheesecake at all. Topped with whipped cream I mean really, did they need to do that.   Loaded with sugar, you can feel it on your teeth, something cheesecakes really shouldn't be.  The sugar makes it addictive and hence popular but definitely not the quality of  cheesecake from Montreal or New York.   Service was excellent.   Really folks, think about the sugar and walk past this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cheektowaga?start=160,3.8,3.8,3.8,2.44,3.8

She went through our gift cards and found one an awesome sister in law gave us for $40 to The Cheesecake Factory. I love me some cheesecake, who doesn't? And we've both been working a ton (12-18hrs a day for both of us for the last 8 days) and haven't seen each other because I work midnights and she works days. So we decided to treat ourselves and spend a little money even though we are STILL paying off our wedding. (Almost done!) and heck we had a $40 gift card, how much could we spend?  So we took the 45 min journey and much to our great surprise were seated promptly. We couldn't believe it. Every time we go that mall there is always a huge line for that restaurant. We've tried a few times to go but wait times were always an hour plus.  So we excitedly looked over the HUGE menu and our mouths started to salivate over all the delicious options. As soon as I saw they had filet and miller light I was all set with the menu. I took in the beautiful room while I waited for my wife to choose and our waiter to come. When he arrived he went over a few things and said ""Just so you know our credit card machine is down, if you want you can still pay with a card but we prefer cash"". Yeah, I know, I didn't understand it either. But I had some cash and with the gift card it should all be covered. I mentioned that to my wife and the waiter said ""oh, no I'm sorry, we can't take gift cards at all.""  I had the receipt to the gift card taped on it. The receipt showed the purchase price.  I guess I don't know how they would check if we've used it before but I'm sure there is some way. And even if not, can you say that you don't accept credit or gift cards today BEFORE we are seated and sat there for 10minutes? We had people on both sides of us and it was EXTREMELY embarrassing.  Anyways, in closing, the wait is usually VERY long, but we got lucky today, room is beautiful, and the little bit of service we were able to get was average.

We shared: Boston Salad ($8.95) and Pasta Carbonara ($16.95) both prepared and put together without any ""cooking"" techniques. Maybe I should not expect someone that really knows how to cook to work in a CF?  My salad was a disaster as it was full of blue cheese. Pasta though prepared al dente but the sauce was so watery and it was more like a soup?! But at least the Pumpkin Cheesecake ($7.95) was smooth and delicious!

The sauce was great and really nicely spiced. My friend got the spaghetti and meatballs and he said it was amazing. I'm honestly always too full to get dessert which is a shame.

We have eaten here a few times and always had good experiences. Tonight however it was a different story although the service was pretty good I ordered the roasted lemon chicken and I substituted sweet potato french fries instead of the mashed potatoes and the snap peas. When my food came I was a little shocked as there wasn't even enough chicken on the plate for a child and the sweet potato fries were WAY over cooked! I was very disappointed as they are charging $18.95 for this and needless to say I was still hungry when we left. My husband ordered the salmon which came with wasabi mashed potatoes and asparagus.   He advised that the salmon was tasty but the mashed potatoes were cold. For dessert we ordered the special peppermint bark cheesecake to share. There is nothing special about it.  The crust was a brownie crust and the cheesecake just tasted average.

The $17 meal came out cold and the pasta was one large congealed glob. When I touched it with my hand and or fork, the entire capellini portion moved all at once as a single unit. Sent it back and did not care to try a replacement or anything else. Kids burger came out SUPER RARE. Didn't know they were in the business of poisoning children. I'm far from a nutritionist, but a kids stomach isn't primed for rare meat.  I told the waitress not to worry about anything, she was great, but the manager came over anyways.

The Cheesecake Factory for me is sorta a last resort not because there food and the service isn't good it's just for some reason the experience doesn't thrill me. I do not get excited when we have to go eat at the cheese cake factory. The cheese cake factory is at the galleria mall so it is convenient if your shopping and want to get a bite to eat but if your not shopping its still actually not a bad place for location to eat. Parking sorta sucks unless you get lucky and someone is pulling out, more likely you will end up parking at the other end of lit which sucks. I love the inside of this place if I had to explain it though Egyptian heaven would be my two words to use which if you think about it and you have been here you will understand what I mean. Only thing is when your eating it's very dark and loud. The service is decent, the only thing I noticed is like 4 different people are servicing you at once which actually was also sorta sucky you don't build any sorta relationship with your waiter or waitress and the waitress (third person who helped service us ) we noticed tried to give our food to the people behind us but eventually they got it right.                                                                              ------Now on to the food I got the shepherds pie and my fiancé got hibachi steak. The shepherds pie was pretty good and actually a pretty decent size and taste wise I give it a 4 my fiancés meal she said it was actually incredible and the steak was cooked perfectly the Veggies were really dry though but over all she said it was a solid 3. So to give the whole experience a four seemed to generous So I'm going to stick with a three because the service and the prices for the food and the fact it's a chain!!

219,Chris K.,"Tucson, AZ",0,5,,1.0,2015-05-26,We went here for an afternoon snack and we planned on getting cheesecake also but the experience we had made us decide to go somewhere else.  We decided to sit in the bar area at the high top tables where we normally do.  We noticed instantly that there was only one waitress working the entire bar seating.  After a long wait we decided to order the Four Cheese Pasta before the cheesecake.  The waitress specifically asked us if we wanted the dinner portion or the lunch portion.  We told her the dinner portion which was almost $15 so we expected a large portion (we also knew that they are known for their large portions). However when a runner brought it out the dish was TINY! Because it was a runner we decided not to eat it right away because we assumed the waitress would be checking on us rather quickly.  However she was slowed down by a large group of 8 that was ordering very slowly (not the waitress's fault) so we waited a good 10 minutes after the food came before we could ask the waitress if they gave us the lunch portion instead.  She said she put in the dinner portion but she also said that it did look a little skimpy!! So she took the dish into the back and asked the kitchen staff would told her it was indeed the dinner portion.  SO basically we had a waitress tell us that their portion was tiny and now because we waited the food was cold.  At least because there was only about 15 ziti size noodles in the dish it didn't take us long to finish it.  Because of this horrible experience with the food we decided to skip on the cheesecake and never return to this restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cheektowaga?start=240,3.2,3.32,3.32,2.9480000000000004,3.2720000000000007

Dana, the manager, approached our table even before we had a chance to order and asked if we would like to move inside. We immediately agreed and moved to a nice booth inside.  The meal just got better from there, I ordered the chicken Madeira, which was delicious and cooked to perfection.  The waitresses and Manager were all very kind to my daughter and indulged her conversation, even if it was only about how old and tall she is.

There was a line, as it was Sunday at lunch time, but we didn't have to wait long, and were placed at a very lovely table. The staff was very helpful with helping us seat the baby we had in our party. My group ordered two appetizers - the crispy fried cheese and the sweet corn fritters. The crispy fried cheese was alright, and I wasn't a huge fan of the corn fritters - too much batter. For our meals, we ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich, the BBQ hamburger, the mac and cheese hamburger and the chicken littles. All of them were wonderful. I myself had the pulled pork sandwich, and it was one of best I had ever had. The portions are huge, so we ended up taking much of our meals home, as we wanted to save room for their namesake, cheesecake. One of the couples ordered the pumpkin, and we ordered the pumpkin pecan. The whip cream is not the greatest - it's the fake sort that leaves a film on your tongue - and the cheesecakes was just OK. In the end, my partner and I got two drinks (a pop and an apple cider), an appetizer, two huge meals and a piece of cheesecake for desert, and the total came to $46.00. Not too bad. Oh, and I wouldn't recommend the cold apple cider - it's not apple cider, but more like apple juice with cinnamon in it, and you get a very small glass for $3.50.

Hate all you want, I love the consistent nature of them, how it doesn't matter if you go to a Cheesecake Factory in NY or California, they all have the same food. When we drove across America to move to NY we called McDonald's our ""benchmark of standard"". If a stop had a McDonald's, we knew it was a ""real"" town. I digress, this is about the Cheesecake Factory and this is my love letter to them. Dearest Cheesecake Factory, It had been far too long since our last encounter. I missed the soft caress of your velvety texture in your cheesecakes. As I bite down in to pumpkin cheesecake bliss, it's like biting right down in to heaven itself.  You humor my efforts to eat healthy with a ""skinnylicious"" menu so I have less guilt about eating your tasty desserts.  Tonight I started with a glass of riesling (Oh, you know me, you dirty slut. Serving up the Chateau Ste. Michelle just like you know I like) before being brought my first of many bread baskets. I am not a fan of the sour dough bread but I do love that brown one your serve (I'm a little kinky like that). I then moved on to my ""skinnylicious"" salmon and vegetables. After 8 years of living in the PNW I had become a salmon snob and I frown Atlantic salmon but you cooked this so right I didn't even mind it's farmed body.  It had just the right amount of a crispiness.  And you cooked it all the way through! I LOVE that, I hate when my fish comes to me still semi raw.  The vegetables were also yummy... yes, YUMMY. I declare those vegetables were cooked to perfection! I think you might be lying to me calling them ""skinnylicious"" because they tasted like they were drenched in butter but that's okay, I like the way you lie. It gave me permission to get what I really came for, the cheesecake. Holy hell Cheesecake Factory, you make a damn fine cheesecake. I love them all but given it's fall I had to get pumpkin.  Service was decent but it wouldn't even matter if it sucked, I love your food so much. My husband got a carbonara thing he always gets and since he was licking the plate when he was finished I think it's safe to say you also have him under your spell.   I love you Cheesecake Factory!

115,Samantha S.,"Huntington, NY",1286,982,738.0,2.0,2015-11-04,"The only benefit about dining at a chain is that you know what you're going to get; the recipes are the same, menus are the same, the philosophy is the same, etc, etc. With that being said, the Cheesecake Factory is one of the only if not the only chain my family and I frequent mostly because of the amount of options they have and because of their ""healthy"" skinnylicious menu. Ultimately, there's something here for everybody and that's very important for the picky eaters (cough cough, me) in my family. An experience goes sour however, when a well known chain like the Cheesecake Factory doesn't have consistency with their quality and portions which is unfortunately what occurred at this particular location during my time dining here. Came in around 9:45 on a Tuesday night after seeing a movie at the Galleria. The kitchen closed at 11, but we noticed the place was pretty empty so we checked in with the hostess first to make sure they weren't trying to close. She assured us we had over an hour before the kitchen was closing and was very pleasant. I have dined at the Cheesecake Factory in my home town on Long Island about 30 times in my life, no exaggeration. It's the same experience every time, you get waters, you get bread. Here at the Galleria, we were brought waters, but nothing about bread was mentioned. This irked me because the person I went out to dinner with heard me rant and rave about the warm brown bread Cheesecake Factory served and it wasn't given to us......yet. We placed drink orders, asked our waitress a little bit about the wine but she didn't have any feedback. With that being said, she did offer to go to the bartender to have any of our questions answered. Shortly after ordering, two glasses of wine came to the table, cabernet for me, Malbec for the other. My cabernet tasted like straight vinegar, the bottle had gone bad, who knows how long is was opened for. Lucky for me, our server was nearby often, I was able to grab her attention to inform her that the bottle went bad, to which she apologized and happily brought me a glass of Malbec. The switch took a little bit longer than it should have but nevertheless, it was done hassle free and the second glass tasted great. We placed our order, started with the Asian lettuce wraps off the skinnylicious menu. Then, I ordered the Mexican Tortilla salad off the skinnylicious menu and asked for all of the dressing to be on the side. My dinner guest got the farfalle pasta and asked if they could toss a bit of spinach in there. Our waitress informed us there would be an upcharge, which I sort of understood until the dinner came out and I saw the amount of spinach in there. It wasn't until we placed our order that the waitress mentioned the idea of bread. We immediately said yes please and waited.......and waited.....and waited some more. Still, no bread. The asian lettuce wraps were the best part of the meal. Exactly how I remembered them from previous experiences. Entrees came out while we had just started enjoying our appetizer, they were trying to get us in and out. It was only 10:15, we still had 45 minutes, we weren't the people who were going to sit in the restaurant all night long, it would have been nice to be able to enjoy our appetizer for another minute before entrees were dropped. We also got another surprise with our entrees......the bread. Why it took a half hour to come out, I will never know. I don't believe this was our server's fault, she was great throughout the entire experience. I think bread should be brought out without question, like it ALWAYS is at the Cheesecake Factory, but she kept mentioning how the bread was in the oven and it would be out shortly. There really was no excuse for the extended wait, most people like bread before their meal, not mid-meal.  I was extremely disappointed with my Mexican Tortilla Salad. It was half (no exaggeration) half the size that I am used to at other Cheesecake Factory restaurants. The salad is $16 and the amount of chicken and substance wasn't worth a penny over $7. The dressing did not taste good, there were 2 small pieces of grilled chicken, it was wildly underwhelming. I always pack up this salad to go at the end of my meal but this time, there was nothing to take to go. The check came to $61. This place is not cheap and for the quality, the price is not justified. Let me reiterate that our server was very friendly and attentive, but the expectation of what I thought we would be getting from Cheesecake Factory was less than satisfactory at the Galleria location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cheektowaga?start=100,3.6,3.4,3.4,3.1760000000000006,3.4800000000000004

The service, this is a different story and unfortunately impacts even the quality of the food. Like in any big place, not always the nicest servers, or the fastest...

I usually order tamales (so good, little sweet), or Santa Fe Salad (my favorite salad!), or sweet potato fries (yummy), and a cheesecake. Just once we ordered some sandwich and it was not good at all - too much white bread (they don't have whole wheat bread), too much dressing or mayo, only few veggies inside and I did not like the chicken taste (marinade) either. But I guess I'm not a sandwich person, this was my first time ordering a sandwich in the restaurant. The cheesecakes here are so good! Most of them are way too sweet but still super delicious. My favorites are Toasted Graham Marshmallow (without marshmallows - too sweet), Reese's Peanut Butter, Pumpkin Cheesecake, White Chocolate Macadamia and Red Velvet Cake.

Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs. We could barely fit everything on our table lol. We each ordered a salad to start. My friend got the fresh kale salad which was very good and I ordered a house salad with balsamic dressing. Unfortunately when I got my salad it looked like there were 2 different dressings on it. The balsamic was there but when I tasted it, there was also a ginger dressing and I couldn't finish it. I let the waitress know and she was kind enough to take it off the bill. For the appetizers we ordered the portobello, avocado and zucchini fries, roasted pear and blue cheese flatbread, fried macaroni and cheese (our favorite), and Thai lettuce wraps. My favorites were the fried macaroni and cheese but I'd had this before and the roasted pear and blue cheese flatbread was delicious. It was my first time eating Thai lettuce wraps. It was ok.

Almost everything I've ever tried at Cheesecake has been amazing.  The only thing I ever regret getting is the oreo cheesecake.  It is definitely not was you expect it to be and I did not enjoy it at all.    Their red velvet cheesecake is their signature cheesecake and ALWAYS a must whenever I go.  However, this particular trip, I got the pumpkin cheesecake and omg, to die for!  SO GOOD. During this trip for my entree, I ordered from the skinnylicious menu and ordered the grilled steak medallions.  My one friend ordered the orange chicken and my other friend ordered a burger (I forgot which one).  My dish was definitely made to be skinnylicious as it was basically just half of what the regular order would be.  There were 4 steak medallions and a smudge of mash potatoes.  It was actually a little funny, but it was the perfect amount of food for me.  The steak was cooked exactly how I asked and it wasn't chewy. I killed everything in 2 seconds and wasn't hungry after.   My friends on the other hand both had to take half their food home.  The orange chicken was actually pretty good.  I had a few pieces.  The gravy my gf got on the side for her fries was absolute real gravy.  You could taste it and there were chunks of meat in the sauce.

The manager said that he doesn't understand why we didn't get what we ordered when they portion everything out equally but he said he would take it off the bill.

As we were not really getting a good vibe from the food, we just ended up ordering some Cheesecake. I ordered the Anniversary Cheesecake and my friend ordered the Cookie Dough Cheesecake. If I were to be blunt, I would say that I wasn't THAT impressed at all, in fact I would say I have had better frozen Cheesecakes.

TBH kind of weird but i was attempting to be healthy. These items weren't meant to be fried so the centres were soggy. They came with 2 sauces, one garlic and the other chipotle. The sauces were delicious and made the veggie fries bearable. 2.5/5 Herb crusted salmon - gf said hers was dry and didn't finish the whole thing, while I found mine perfectly done. And it went very well with the lemon sauce that it came with. 3.5/5 Chicken Madeira - breaded chicken with cheese and mushrooms. Sauce went with the chicken very well and it was not dry at all. It also came with a potato mash that was just the right consistency and seasoned right. 3.5/5 CHEESECAKE: This is why we come anyways right? Banana cream - my favourite here and what I get every time. If you don't want something too heavy and chocolatey, this is for you. This was paired with slice bananas and whipped cream.

The parking situation sucks on this side of the mall, unless you pay for valet, so we were just about frozen solid by the time we made it into the building.  (Then my son threw a fit because he decided right then that he wanted the toy he left in the car- sorry, buddy, I'm not going back out into the tundra to get your Matchbox car.)   It was around 2pm on a Saturday, so we had to wait 20 minutes for a table.  We passed the time by drooling over the cheesecakes in the big showcase and admiring the architecture and decor. Once seated, we were served complimentary bread and butter, which was delicious.  I should have asked for the name of the brown bread with the oats on it.  It's divine! Our food came out surprisingly quickly.  I ordered the Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad, Mom ordered the Chicken Salad Sandwich, and RJ ordered a pepperoni pizza from the kids menu.  I *know* this is going to sound ridiculous to many of you, but I was disgusted by the size of the portions.  These plates are too big.  I am an eater, don't get me wrong, but the portions here are EXCESSIVE.  (Reference my photos.)  I would MUCH rather pay a slightly smaller price for less food on my plate than have a monstrosity of a dish come out and take up the entire table.  My salad was served on an 18-inch-long plate and piled about 6 inches high.  My mom's sandwich was actually three full sandwiches.  The pizza for my 6-year-old could have fed two grown adults.  When Europeans make fun of ""American portions"", this is why.  I don't know why it bothered me so much, but it was all just too much food.  It all looked ridiculous. They should seriously consider making their portions smaller and more manageable and cutting the price down a tad.  It would make it all so much more appealing. The service was good this time.  Other times we've visted, it hasn't been as good (servers with attitude, lack of attentiveness, etc) so they must've had a good team on.  They were pretty busy, and our waitress did apologize for not coming back for some time after checking on our food, which was ok since we were good on drinks and everything anyway.   Our total came to about $35 for two adult entrees, two waters, a kid entree and lemonade.  Is it cheap?  Not really, but the food is good and the service is good, depending on the day.  And if you feel like spending $7 on a slice of cheesecake, I've heard it's delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cheektowaga?start=20,3.44,3.62,3.62,3.408,3.5480000000000005

Being it my first time here I did expect some hiccups during prime time, so I'm willing to give this place another chance when it's less saturated.  As for the food, I ordered a dulce de leche cheesecake, which was as soft as a cloud and pleasantly sweet. It's definitely a thick mixture so prepare yourself with a tall glass of water. You will need something to help the thickness of the cream go down. I also believe they include way too much whipped cream.

18,Allie A.,"Mississauga, Canada",119,46,81.0,2.0,2017-02-22,"My heart is so sad to give my visit here a two star review.  Overly salted pasta water made noodles on two dishes impossible to enjoy. An hour and a half wait for one person's entree. No tartar sauce on a fish and chips dish, and the sauce didn't come for an hour, leaving the fish cold. Sides were mixed up and burgers weren't cooked to established preference. Abundance of used dishes on the table for long periods of time. The server and manager sympathized with us as the kitchen staff poorly worked around our table. A few cheesecakes were offered with compliments... the cheesecakes couldn't be screwed up though. They're baked out of house. Keep in mind: my visit was probably a very rare occurrence; furthermore, it was President's Day/Ontario Family Day, so it was also insanely busy.  That said, some of the food was great. Some highlights: Calamari had a super flaky and crispy batter with just the right amount of salty, peppery seasoning.  The nachos, although they had a processed American cheese, were fried in a puffed style. Super delicious.  My chicken piccata, outside of the overly salted angel hair pasta, had a delicious lemon, caper, and mushroom sauce with a perfect balance of taste.  Not too citrusy or salty. The offering of a lunch menu with smaller portions and less expensive pricing was great.  I really do want to give this place another chance.

19,Caitlyn P.,"Buffalo, NY",79,64,177.0,4.0,2017-02-27,"Celebrated my sisters birthday here last night! Party of 8 and we arrived for dinner at 7:30. This restaurant doesn't take reservations which stinks, so we ended up waiting till about 8 o'clock to be seated on a Sunday night. I was pretty shocked it was so packed. By 830 though; the restaurant had cleared out tremendously.  We had ordered 2 orders of cheese burger sliders to start. Those were good. For dinner I always usually order the turkey club with French fries. They use real turkey breast so it's always a good, quick meal and good left overs.  Everyone ordered something different. There spicy chicken sandwich is very good. My brother ordered a version of chicken parm. It was a huge piece of chicken in the shape of a pizza, so just a big circle of chicken with angel hair pasta over it. It looked funny, but he said it was yummy and ate it. We had people order Parmesan crusted chicken, a salad, burgers.. everyone enjoyed their meals. My dad did order the chicken biscuits and gravy for dinner and specifically told the waitress no mushrooms. The waitress came back and said they made it with mushrooms do you want us to re make it or can you pick the mushrooms out? My dad asked them to re make it. Then she came back again when we all were basically done eating and said that the mushrooms are apart of the gravy, so my dad just didn't even bother ordering something else he just didn't have an entree. It was okay though because we had the sliders before hand and so much food to share with him.  Many people ordered cheese cake which is always delicious. I was too full at that point! Overall I would say the food here is pretty good. They have an absolutely ginormous menu so you will always find something you like.  Cons are it's always packed, wait time is long and the minor incident with my dads meal.

To be honest I often question why I end up ordering a meal and not just get a cheesecake and coffee, but every time I end up ordering the Renee's Special: Half a Turkey Sandwich, Bowl of Soup, and Small Salad (I usually substitute this for a Caesar Salad for a $1.00 up charge). The turkey sandwich is good, nothing special, I truly think you could make your own at hope with a Kings Hawaiian roll, with turkey, tomato, and mayo on it. The bowl of soup is usually my favorite part of the meal, it always seems to be hot and fresh. The Caesar Salad like the Turkey Sandwich is good, but nothing to rave about.  But dessert is where The Cheesecake Factory shines, all of the cheesecakes are amazing but my personal favorites are the Red Velvet and the Tiramisu. And the good news if you fill up on a meal, or don't want wait a long wait for a table just for dessert, they have a take-out dessert counter with all their cheesecakes on display available for order.

I've been to The Cheesecake Factory more times than I can count on each hand, and I've never had a truly horrible experience, until today. Coming in on a Sunday, midday, I was excepting it to be busy, however only 5 minutes for two people! That's amazing. When getting a table, we were placed in that awkward bar section where the tables are right on top of each other; so close you can hear your neighbors conversation. We noticed the table next to us was becoming into a big table for a group, and this turned out to be a family of 6, where the mother kept yelling at everyone. Her mother and father ate all the appetizer while she stepped out, they wouldn't try something different so they had to get the boring option. Her daughter kept talking to her like she was the mother, and taking care of her toddler son, who kept banging things against the table, in which who she would raise her voice to.  It didn't end there with our bad experience. You cannot do anything about other parties, so we kindly kept to ourselves and enjoyed each other's company. Well, our waitress was one the worst ever. We must have waited 15 minutes to order, every time we needed a refill she was no where to be found, and not to mention every time we had a request, such as the straws she never brought to the table, or some extra ketchup, it was as if you were asking her to find a needle in a hay stack. The food was very good though; my bacon-bacon cheeseburger and my boyfriends mac and cheese burger were both cooked to perfection. We were so aggravated with our server, we took our Cheesecake to go, and it was even better at home then in house.

She returned with a handful of dry bev naps which hardly did the trick on the sticky table. But we let it ride. We ordered wine and water. We asked for straws for our water but she never brought them. So we asked the food runner when he brought our appetizer.  He got straws and also pre-bussed our bread plates. Cool. Another food runner dropped of our entrees. I stacked all our dirty app dishes at the tables edge to make it easier for someone to grab them. Nobody ever did. They sat in our face the whole meal. After our food was delivered, Alicia never checked back to see how things were. I had Baja chicken tacos which were a little bland so I wanted to ask for hot sauce or Tabasco but I never had the chance because she never came to check. She came back only when my husband's plate was empty to see if we wanted dessert.

31,Samantha C.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",9,123,41.0,4.0,2017-06-13,"Who doesn't love The Cheesecake Factory?  I've been to this location a number of times and while we find the portions have gotten smaller  and prices have risen, which, understandably so, the prices of everything has gone up, is still a fantastic option for any occasion. The menu is massive and anyone from the foodie to the picky eater will be able to find something that appeals to them.  Some of my favourite items are the chicken Madeira, chicken and biscuits, cajun chicken littles, louisiana chicken pasta, basically any chicken dish from the favourites pages! They also have steak, seafood, salads, burgers, basically everything.  I did notice on my last visit that they seem to have eliminated a lot of the menu, which for me is good as I find the choices to be overwhelming, to have 6 pages of 'favourites' seems a bit ridiculous so i'm glad they're streamlined the menu and focused on the best of the best. It is unfortunate for those whose favourite items have been eliminated however. It seems that they had some items on a special menu which the server described as new 'test' items, some of which would be added to the menu. These items were significantly lower in price which made them enticing to try. I opted for one of these test items called chicken riesling, which was some grilled chicken topped with a riesling sauce, with bacon, mushrooms and onions served with a buttered pasta. The chicken was delicious, the portion was large enough for dinner and then a small lunch the next day, The pasta was a bit bland, I guess the riesling sauce could have also been used for the pasta, but there wasn't quite enough of this sauce. Overall it was delicious still. The portions have become less ridiculous, some members of my family were able to finish their entire meals, which before was an utter impossibility.  The service was great as usual, bread and water refills were offered regularly and our server was friendly and sincere. The restaurant is spacious and beautiful. The cheesecake fridge at the front is filled with delicious options which is great for looking at while waiting for a table. This place seems to be popular among tourists like me who have come across the border for a shopping day, but also seems to be popular among locals. Be prepared to wait at peak times!!  I would definitely recommend this restaurant after a day or a lunch break from shopping at the mall. You'll get good service, big portions of food for your money and i've really never been disappointed with my meal. The only thing is that the prices have risen marginally, likely just to keep up with food prices, and the exchange rate is a bit crazy right now so you're looking at meals costing at least $20-$30 Canadian per person depending on what you eat, which of course is not the restaurant's fault, but it isn't the amazing value that it used to be for us Canadians!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cheektowaga?start=20,3.68,3.64,3.436,2.9920000000000004,3.6560000000000006

He was personable, helpful, understanding! I apologized for the mess the kiddos made and he responded ""no worries, that's what I am here for"" (and sounded genuine). I didn't give 5 stars because I didn't love my meal. We had the shrimp summer rolls appetizer and that was amazing. I had the Mexican tortilla salad. It looked great and was a lot of food.

My favorites are the fried mac and cheese and crab wontons for appetizers, bang bang chicken and shrimp and the cobb salad for mains, and you cannot go wrong with any of their famous cheesecakes for dessert, such as their fresh strawberry and salted caramel cheesecake. There are a few cheesecakes that I loved that are no longer offered such as pistachio white chocolate and the pineapple upside down cheesecake, hopefully they bring them back someday. Another great dessert is their strawberry shortcake, the cake is nice and light, not too sweet and the strawberries are fresh. I've never had a problem with the service, servers are generally friendly and some even try to strike up a conversation once they realize that you're from Canada.

So of course having a sweet tooth I decided to pick up two flavours to try and I got dulce de leche caramel cheesecake and vanilla bean cheesecake. The dulce de leche cheesecake was sweeter with layers of caramel and topped with almonds. The vanilla bean cheesecake was a lighter, less sweet cheesecake compared to the other one I got. However I was pleased with both the flavours I got, and it's definitely a size good enough to share with other people.

I came all the way from Toronto just to try this famous American chain, believe me, it was worth the 2.5 hour drive. Everything just taste so unhealthy in the most delicious way, I really can't explain it haha.  Thankfully this cheese cake factory has a few selections of Canadian beers, Canadians rejoice. Started off with the buffalo wings, yup you guessed it, they were my favourite by far and the best I've tried;the perfect balance between crispy and soft. My girlfriend got the eggplant parmigiana, served with a pesto spaghettini. The sauce used on the eggplant was incredible, it upsets me that the food was this good because unlike other chain restaurants that lack in flavour ,usually, this one is completely opposite. Anyways back to the dishes. I ordered a serious artery clogger, the mac and cheese burger. The most delicious mac and cheese you can ever imagine, battered and formed into a patty served on top of a medium cooked angus burger, which was heaven might I add, and in between a brioche bun. It was intense, you need to experience it.  The best part of all was the cheese cake. My words won't do justice. just go try any of them, I'm sure they're all equally delicious.  I'll definitely be back one day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cheektowaga?start=20,3.84,3.66,3.472,3.124,3.732

I love that this location is nestled beside Walden Galleria, because it is one of 3 places i love to go shopping when i go across the border. I love the town of Amherst because it offers the best dining & hotel options minus the crazy pricing of being right at the falls. The Cheesecake Factory is a shopping stop tradition! We were seated immediately and we were served by one of the best servers i've had at a restaurant. She offered suggestions and explained portion sizes etc. We discussed allergy concerns immediately and she assured us of what was safe to eat and further explained to us that EVERYTHING on the menu was made/cooked fresh to order"". I remembered this based on our experience at their other brand The Grand Luxe Cafe.  The kids menu had a great variety of items. Our kids chose tenders & fries. We were going to order 2, but our server suggested 1 as the portion was large enough for them to share. Grateful for that! I ordered the Asian chicken salad (minus the almonds). HUGE portion, i couldn't finish it. Fresh ingredients, tasted as good as if i had made it at home myself! I really wish i had taken a photo of it to show how large the salad was, but i couldn't help digging in as soon as it was set in front of me! My hubby ordered one of their fantastic burgers (Kobe Burger). He was so happy that it was cooked perfectly, large portion, seasoned well. We also ordered an appetizer to share (which we took back to our hotel). Lastly we ordered 2 pieces of cheesecake - Red Velvet Cheesecake & Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake. Absolutely delicious! I am really looking forward to the location opening at Yorkdale Mall in Toronto - i hope the standard of service & quality doesn't change! We didn't need to flag our server down even once.

34,Thuy P.,"Saint Paul, MN",1,36,99.0,2.0,2017-08-29,"I was visiting from out of town and stayed at the Buffalo Millennium, which is only a two minute drive to the Walden Galleria and The Cheesecake Factory. Having heard about the Cheesecake Factory prior and how they're infamous for their cheesecake, I was curious as to how the establishment tastes, feels and looks. With most places in the Buffalo area closing around 10 P.M; it left us with fairly limited options when our stomachs finally decided its been 10 hours since lunch and we should probably eat. If I were to describe Cheesecake Factory in a short sentence, I'd say: It's kind of like Olive Garden but with cheesecake. We stopped by a late Saturday night and the place was loud and bustling. Loud chatter, laughter and exhausted looking servers roaming around. The place was huge in size and almost completely packed. We had to wait our turn to be seated and the hostess seemed agitated and really half assed her service. Neither of us were enjoying the vibe and atmosphere, not to mention how loud the few tables next to us were. We came to terms that service will be forgetful and mediocre due to the high volumes of customers, which is understandable. It took a while before the server made their round to take our orders. For appetizers, we got some cheesy bread that accompanied two dipping sauces. Unfortunately, both dipping sauces were cold. It still boggles my mind why the marinara sauce was cold and the other dipping sauce was supposedly a ""parmesan salsa"" but it was nothing but cold grease. The garlic bread was fine however. Warm, soft and cheesy, but a bit too greasy for our liking. Overall, the appetizer was not worth the 10$. We realized we made the mistake of ordering bread as an appetizer, when two small loafs of bread came as a complementary starter. These other loaves of bread were clearly better. They were fresh and warm, but they were paired with butter that came in small packages. So much for being fresh.  As for the main course, we decided upon pasta: Angel Hair with Shrimp and Spicy Chipotle Chicken Penne. Our server came back apologetic for the slow service, and presented us with two very large servings. There was no way one person could finish these plates, especially after so much bread. My friend's plate looked normal, but mine was something else... even while writing this review, I'm still pondering what was used as the pasta's topping. Everything looked fine, but not the crispy chips sprinkled everywhere on this penne. The crispy chips infiltrated the flavor palette and eventually got mushy, making it even more difficult to finish this dish. The penne was cooked fine, the sauce was mediocre, chicken was meh, but the crispy toppings just completely ruined it. After about ten bites, I was absolutely done. My friend had no complaints with the angel hair pasta until they came across a huge chunk that remained attached and uncooked. I'm not sure what went wrong. Maybe it was too busy of a night and mistakes just happened or is this typically how the food is? In Minneapolis, a 60$ meal for two would be enough for some four or five star quality dining.  I left rather disappointed and regretting paying this much for a few bites. However, Steven M. was a great server. He was the saving grace to our dinner disaster. Charismatic, attentive, and very apologetic. We were impressed with his calm mannerism and ability to juggle so many orders, while paying attention to ours. My final thoughts: the place was loud, I could've had pasta from a frozen entree, but service was pleasant thanks to Steven.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cheektowaga?start=20,3.68,3.64,3.468,,3.6560000000000006

My personal favorite thing to get is the Chinese Chicken Salad. It's tart and sweet with oranges, nuts, wontons, and a yummy dressing.  Other people in my party recently had salads as well. Because we were starving, we ordered the pot stickers appetizer and the asian lettuce chicken wraps.  Pot stickers were very good and drenched in yummy sauce.  The wraps were AMAZING though... lots of good green with flavorful chicken and a nice sauce to give it some pizzazz. Couldn't get enough.  The other stand-out to my latest visit was the service-- our waiter, Eddie, was funny, attentive, and brought the two birthday girls a special treat without being asked.  Next time, I will be sure to ask for him. Everyone also had a cocktail. As I was nursing a hangover, I just had a strawberry lemonade which was delicious and the glass was even coated in sugar. My girlfriend had a J.W.'s lemonade, which was similar to mine but with alcohol.   The only downside to this wonderful place is the price and the wait time.

6,Aly W.,"Newfane, NY",71,360,331.0,4.0,2017-12-12,"The great (but not as good as the calamari) dynamite shrimp I had at P.F. Changs today reminded me of the bad dynamite shrimp I had here a few weeks ago. I don't know if it's the batter or the oil they fry it in, but it has a really unpleasant aftertaste, and I feel like people should be warned.  That said, there's a lot to like about the Cheesecake Factory. Normally I don't review chains because people generally know what to expect, but in the case of this chain, that's stellar service and this location was no exception. Really, I wish I reviewed it that day because our server was excellent and deserves recognition. The too-large menu gets a lot of flack, but they do have some exceptional items, which is all the more reason to avoid the dynamite shrimp you can get just about anywhere. I wish I stuck with my staples like the shrimp scampi or the herb crusted salmon, or tried some of the lighter fare that actually sounded pretty appealing.  I still miss the shoe string fries they used to serve, but their honey mustard is still the same magic elixir I've always loved. We didn't get any cheesecake because it was the day before Thanksgiving, and I always make my special cheesecakes for the holidays.  Theirs are good, but mine are better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cheektowaga,3.28,3.55,3.492,,3.442
3,Sara P.,"Niagara Falls, NY",18,77,82.0,3.0,2017-12-17,"If given the choice between a chain and a locally owned and operated restaurant, I never hesitate towards the latter.  That being said, if I have a gift card, or am going out with friends who are picking where we go for the night, the Cheesecake Factory would be one of my top picks. Definitely a great place in terms of environment, the decorations, lighting, the dress of the wait staff and overall look are definitely pleasing.  The niceness of a fancy restaurant with a more casual feel.   They definitely have an extensive menu.  I tend to find the prices a little much in my opinion.  I ordered a chicken cheesesteak and chose the the side salad in place of the fries.  It sandwich was good, but the bread was a little on the hard side for my liking.  I'm sure that some people like the harder, crustier bread of the baguette, but personally I like something a little softer.  The salad was very plain, just lettuce with 2 slices of tomato.  At 13.95, it didn't seem to merit the extra $4 where I've gotten similar food for $10 at other local restaurants.  My husband got the chicken mediera which was really good.  The flavor and combination of mushrooms, cheese, and asparagus on the chicken was very good.  It was $19 which again I felt was a little much, but at least it had some special tastes to set it apart.   We did order a slice of the banana cream cheesecake which was excellent.  The lightness of the banana cream is a great combination for rich cheesecake.  I know cheesecake is fancy and special, but the piece does seem pretty steep at $8 for the smallness of the piece, it seems like they have gotten smaller over the years, but isn't that just the way of the world? Overall the food is good, but with the high prices for nothing extra special my overall rating can't be higher than a 3.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cheektowaga,3.2,3.53,3.496,,3.398
2,Lauren S.,"Hamburg, NY",69,91,89.0,4.0,2017-12-20,"THE MENU IS INSANITY. There. my review is over. Ohh... you want to hear about the restaurant and the food ? Fine. I personally love the restaurant décor. The full bar is amazing, the stained glass is nice and I really enjoy the high ceilings. I don't like how close some of the tables are. We've been here about 5 times... and twice we have had to have conversations with the groups next to us because we are practically ontop of eachother. Now the food... It's either really really good, or really not good. I've had issues with just about all of the pasta dishes. The pasta is almost always over cooked and mushy. I stopped bothering to get pasta. The best appetizer we have ever had is the buffalo chicken eggrolls (SOO GOOD!). The best meal we have ever had was the roast beef au ju or the shrimp and chicken jumbo. Did I mention the menu is insanity ? No really... there is an option for  everyone. Kids menu, vegan menu, chicken, shrimp, beef, pork, salads, etc. The menu is probably about 10 pages, maybe more. Don't even get me started with the cheesecake...omg, every single piece is fantastic. My favorite is the white chocolate raspberry. My husbands favorite is the vanilla bean. I have actually gotten him a full vanilla bean cheesecake from here for his birthday and it was just as good as in the restaurant. It's probably my favorite chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cheektowaga,3.16,3.53,3.5,,3.382
1,Betty Y.,"Markham, Canada",0,7,16.0,5.0,2018-01-01,"This Cheesecake Factory is a great place to have a meal with friends or family. This location is located within the Walden Galleria mall so you can always shop around while you wait because the waits do range up until an hour sometimes. I came here multiple times and almost always had to wait, though the food was worth it. Many cheesecakes to choose from and large selection of meals as well!  The one thing I would recommend is to call ahead and see how long the wait time is. Also, their fish and chips weren't as great as the other items on the menu. Also...The portion sizes are huge!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cheektowaga,3.24,3.56,3.504,,3.432000000000001

For my main course I had the Hibachi Steak and I was not dissapointed! Everything was rich in flavor and the staff was courteous and kind.

Located in the Walden Galleria, the CCF serves a HUGE menu of traditional fare such as burgers, pastas, steaks, etc....and of course their famous cheesecakes.  No chain is as well known in these parts as for their huge selection of cheese cakes. Not only is the menu huge, the portions are also really big.  For big eaters like me its a blessing but for smaller eaters either get a lunch sized portion or just share a dish as you really need to save room for the cheese cakes which are always a delight. Service is very good and the vibe is very casual fine dining. The location here is great as its part of the mall and the line up is pretty non existent compared to the madness that is the Yorkdale location.  By the time you get your pager and finally get your food you could have already driven all the way to Buffalo and finished your dinner!  Haha! Love the CCF!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cheektowaga,3.24,3.56,3.52,,3.432000000000001
