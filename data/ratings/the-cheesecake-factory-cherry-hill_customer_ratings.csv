110,Nando F.,"San Diego, CA",884,539,1725.0,5.0,2012-04-16,"Yea 5 stars for a chain location...  I brought my wife here Sunday night for an early anniversary dinner(seeing on Tuesday i am at an interview) We have eaten at their other location in King Of Prussia and i must say seeing this is the second time.. no complaints.. We had outside seating seeing the weather was Gorgeous and the wait time was 1 min, compaired to 15-20 min for inside dining. Which is common for this place, also its not as cold as it was inside.. felt like a cold box once you walked in. My wife as much as i LOVE her she is always cold.. it could be 85 outside and she can still complain about it being cold.. Don't know its her Latino blood.. but thats besides. The outside was perfect, light breeze, beautiful scenerie.. a look of the stores and how it was lit up by the lights and florals outside. (Not saying inside was bad, that too looked comfortable, easy on the eyes) Our service was great, our waitress was friendly recommended some specials there were doing. They also have a newer menu out its their 500 calorie or less menu(for those of you who want to enjoy the great food, but not to worry about gaining weight)I saw the menu, i looked over it , i must say i was impressed, the meals they had on there.. you wouldn't think they were 500 cal, or less. OK now lets get into the goods...  We started off with some drinks, wifey got the Pina Colada, i got the Pomegrante Mojito.. (very very good) , our appitzers we both went salads, my wife got the veggi salad,(this is one big salad) and myself a Boston salad.. Lets say Boston won this battle of the salads, very tasty, had bacon on it so you know its a winner hands down, shredded and little chunks of  blue cheese and ranch dressing.. I reccommend that salad if you guys like salads..  For our main course, which i gotta say the portions are incredible.. more like HUGE. My wife and i both went with steaks but she had the shrimp scampi with a fillet cut medium, with wasabi mash, and veggies. Looked great , cooked to her likings. Myself i went with the Hibachi steak, medium with tempura asparagas, also wasabi mash, shitake mushrooms in a sweet, but not overbearing sauce.. gotta say they knocked it out of the park with this... Phenominal.  Our waitress did a great job, made sure if we liked evrything, or any problems.. it did get a little cold outside(for my wife) i enjoyed it... but i did ask if she could turn on the heater they have, she did, without any hesitation or surroundings people. I think the wives/gf's around us were also grateful of this..  We didn't get any cheesecake  because we were full , but i know she brought home 2 slices, dulce de leche, and a vannilla bean.. do you think i will get a taste.. ERRRRR wrong lol . But we did walk around after the meal to look at the stores .. i recommend that after this feast you will embark",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=100,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.508,3.5600000000000005

Dinner was awsome. bread was good, I had one of my fav's steak diane and shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta. The pesto sauce was awsome. Steak was yummy, tender and perfectly cooked. I dont know why its hard for other restaurants to cook a Medium steak the right way. Got the Ritz martini and it was awsome! i love champagne and they put just the right amount. We didn't get away cheap but it was well worth it. 2 entrees, 2 alcohol drinks, 2 pieces of cheesecake and a soda $78.00. Id pay it again anyday. My bf loved it. It was his first time.

181,Mark H.,"Wynnewood, PA",45,141,,3.0,2012-05-14,"What can I say, that you wouldn't already know about Cheesecake Factory? This one located near much shopping in Cherry Hill is a good example of a normal Cheesecake Factory.  It's got the gigantic menu.  Everything comes in large portions for a relatively low price.  There is a good drink menu and everything tastes pretty good. Service here has always been pretty good and as long as you don't come at a big rush time you can usually get seated pretty quickly.  Up to this point, I'd easily give this location 4 stars. The only problem is the floors are so greasy.  This isn't an isolated problem.  It seems like this is a recurring problem at many Cheesecake Factory locations.  Perhaps their kitchen ventilation installations aren't enough for all locations?  Maybe the staff at locations don't have the proper equipment from corporate to properly maintain the floors?  Either way it's a serious annoyance and speaks poorly of the overall cleanliness of the chain as a whole.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=200,3.8,3.8,3.8,3.0840000000000005,3.8
146,Matt C.,"Willingboro, NJ",43,236,100.0,3.0,2012-05-22,"Note that if you're going here for CHEESECAKE, it gets 12 stars. The Red Velvet Cheesecake should be illegal its so good. With that said, the 3 stars is for overall. First things first; I have never been here and NOT had to wait a ridiculous amount of time to get a table. It is CONSTANTLY packed. When you finally do get a table, settle in, because the menu is TWELVE PAGES LONG. Yes. The food menu....for a restaurant....is 12 pages long. Its like a phone book of food choices. It is an obnoxious amount of choices.  When you make it past your 2 billion choices and settle on something, I hope youre hungry. My little brother got a starter salad, AND GOT THE HALF PORTION, and I think they brought it in a wheelbarrow. Do people seriously eat this much?! (although by looking at the usual bloated, obese Cheesecake Factory clientele, it would appear so.)  As for myself, I ordered the americana burger, medium, which came overcooked, yet still juicy.  The food is good and the dessert is transcendent. The decor is nice, but spacing between tables is kinda tight. Prices are pretty standard for going out to eat; $10-12 for a burger, and $9-12 for mixed drinks. (Full bar is a plus.) Overall, Cheesecake Factory is a very safe bet. You're almost guaranteed to find SOMETHING on their War and Peace sized menu to enjoy, and it will most likely be tasty at worst.

We did not have to wait for a table/booth, and he had already been seated and served bread by the time I arrived. Within moments of my arrival, we were informed that the original server was finished her shift and another waitress was taking over. No problems there. Plus our order was taken in a timely manner (a cobb salad and a side salad). My cobb salad was amazing, from presentation to taste, and was like literally the best salad I've ever had (even though I ordered it without the avacado and tomato.

The nacho platter was pretty much nachos and cheese whiz. Meatloaf was fatty. Mashed potatoes were more boiled potatoes than they were mashed. When the waiter saw I didn't really touch my food, he offered me to eat something else. I went with the chicken fingers, which I didn't see on the menu but he said they have some items they don't list. I got them, they weren't bad, similar to Church's chicken, but much more expensive.

We were immediately offered bread, but we declined. We ordered iced teas with extra lemon and splenda which came out quickly as ordered. Refreshing iced tea! Brewed in house I believe.

When we came in we asked for a warmer table as we had forgotten our sweaters and it was FREEZING inside. The hostess rolled her eyes and said it will get warmer later. I said, maybe but it's really rather cold now. She rolled her eyes AGAIN so we decided it was too 'chilly' for us, excused ourselves and as we were turning to leave she SLAMMED the menus on the counter. We would have stayed to eat if she hasn't kept rolling her eyes at us... We were just wondering where the warmest spot was. It really is one of those places where they keep it way too cold. I understand the staff gets hot when they work, but since when does the comfort of waiters come above the paying customers.

214,Donald L.,"Mt Laurel, NJ",37,6,,5.0,2013-01-08,"A year ago, on the occasion of our 20th wedding anniversary, my wife and I had a great dinner at The Cheesecake Factory in Cherry Hill. One year later, on our 21st anniversary, we went back. A tradition has begun! Here are my thoughts from our most recent romantic visit. We dumped the kids at the home of some excellent friends, and arrived at the restaurant about 2PM on a Sunday afternoon. Incidentally, though kids are welcome at the Cheesecake Factory, I think it would be hard to enjoy myself there with our 4 kids in tow. Our kids are pretty well behaved, but even still, I'd worry about them disturbing other restaurant guests, and that would keep me from relaxing and enjoying myself. Also, it's a bit expensive to take kids there. Honestly, my kids would be just as happy at the golden arches... We were told our wait would be 20 minutes. Turned out to be only 8. Not bad. That's just enough time to peer into the cheesecake cooler and decide what to have for dessert. (More on that later....) The atmosphere is loud, but that actually works to your advantage inasmuch as the noise level allows your conversation to be private. Surrounding conversations are simply part of the room noise, and that's important since tables are spaced pretty close together. Some reviews I've read complain about the 19-page menu and the insane number of food choices. I personally love lots of choices. Heck, this is America, and freedom of choice is what we love, like one of those inalienable rights! I chose the Sausage and Broccolini Pasta. That was a real winner. Perfect pasta, fresh veggies, good flavor. The dinner portion was a lot of food, but I could handle it! My wife chose the Hibachi steak, accompanied by mash potatoes with wasabi butter and tempura asparagus. I sampled her steak, which was good. But I don't get the idea of deep-fried asparagus. Whatever. Our server was very pleasant and did a fine job. Knowing that we loved that brown bread they serve, I think she included some extra bread in our doggy-bag.  And then, of course, there's the cheesecake. My wife went for the Tuxedo Cheesecake, which she loved, but I took a simpler approach: the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake.  My wife commented, (but without a trace of criticism) that my selection seemed a bit ""boring."" Maybe so. I admit to being much less adventuresome.  But for me, I needed purity of flavor at that point. And vanilla is never wrong. Remember that. I was quite satisfied. Based on a fantastic experience of great food and a new yearly anniversary tradition with the love of my life, The Cheesecake Factory is nothing but happiness for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=220,3.52,3.52,3.52,3.4120000000000004,3.5200000000000005

We met some friends for brunch on Saturday and were seated right away (we got there when it opened - 11am..ideal) and ordered some drinks.  The cafe mocha, a rich chocolate and coffee blend, is one of my favorite coffee-style drinks.  We were planning to start off with our all-time favorite CF appetizer, the chicken croquettes, but were saddened to learn that they had been removed from the menu.  (deep breath) but we had to move on.  It's actually a good thing that we didn't since we filled up on bread and still couldn't finish our entrees. I ordered the breakfast fiesta burrito; loaded with cheese, potatoes, scrambled eggs, chorizo sausage, peppers and onions, stuffed inside a giant tortilla shell and served on top of a very spicy and delicious tomatillo sauce.  They also present it with a side dish of black beans, but I barely touched the mundane additives; I'd ask for the burrito without them next time.. or substitute some fruit.  Either way, the burrito was amazing and I almost finished it, but remembed to save room for dessert. My wife was feeling more lunch'ish and went with the chicken littles (an oxymoron if I've ever seen one).  Her plate came loaded with fresh (easy to tell it's not factory compressed) chicken tenders, mashed potatoes and a corn/zucchini succotash.  The chicken was delicious, especially with the bbq sauce. Our companions chose the same style of entress, one got a hamburger and the other a breakfast sandwich.  Both reported them as tasty. Dessert brought the next round of disappointment.  Maybe they moved it, but they used to have an awesome chocolate cake, layered with chocolate and coconut.  By far, one fo the best non-cheesecake desserts in their repertoire.  It, along with the chicken croquettes, will always be remembered.

The decor alone will make you forget your in a restaurant because you'll be too busy admiring the architecture and the artwork along the ceiling and the walls.  The waitresses/ waiters manage to always look clean with their white shirts always crisp and never dingy. The silverware isn't just ""clean"" it's shining and the knives are never dull. The bar is fully stocked with a huge flatscreen to compliment it.

168,Amina W.,"Philadelphia, PA",37,97,5.0,4.0,2013-04-10,"This place is one of my favorites, but I can usually only stand to go for lunch since the wait time for dinner is almost always RIDIC.  Momma W. and I tend to make this our favsies mom-daughter date spot, and this Saturday was no exception. I love their new ""Skinnylicious"" menu, which gives lighter versions of menu favorites.  Most of the time I don't even realize it's been lightened up, since it's still so tasty.  There are also some great lunch specials that won't overwhelm your GI tract too. One thing I was impressed with was our server, (I believe his name was Jeremy?), who was not only crazy friendly, but looking out for us as well.  My mom had ordered a sandwich off of the skinny menu, with a bowl of soup as well... and he informed us that it would be cheaper (and the same exact thing) if she were to order the lunch special of soup and sandwich.  What a guy!  Most servers, I feel, would have just let her go with the more expensive option since a bigger bill = bigger tip.  Two thumbs up! I love, love, love the factory chopped salad (although disclaimer: the skinny version doesn't have bacon.  fail).  I've also had the chicken and avocado sandwich (phenomenal), and the chicken salad sammie (rockin).  I love the pumpernickel bread they bring out to munch on, and I also love that since Momma W. and I both ordered from the skinny menu, he asked if we wanted the bread.  OBV we want it... but it was nice that he was being conscious of our choices. The cheesecake speaks for itself... but full disclosure: I can't bring myself to order it on the regular.  My waistline just can't afford it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=160,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.152,3.76
175,Kathleen L.,"Philadelphia, PA",12,28,12.0,1.0,2013-04-21,"THE WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE EVER!!!! My boyfriend and I just left the Cheesecake Factory and it was by far the worst dining experience ever. We were seated and only had knives for utensils. Then we ordered appetizers and drinks. Our drink order was right the first time and then after that the server, Nicholas M brought out the wrong drinks - not difficult, we both ordered a diet coke.  Our table was never fully cleared after our appetizers were finished. Then for the really ""great"" part of the night, our meal. After waiting for over 45 minutes (the restaurant was not nearly as crowded as I have seen it before) our food arrives. My boyfriends was right, mine on the other hand was not. I ordered the fettuccine with chicken and sun dried tomatoes. My ONLY request was to have penne pasta instead of fettuccine. Surprisingly enough, they gave me fettuccine.  As my boyfriend finished his meal, mine finally came, this time only about 35 minutes later. Neither time did our actual server bring us our food. I ate about three bites of my food and was so angry that I wanted to leave. I even wanted to have dessert but was so annoyed at how poorly our service was that I opted out.  But wait, it still gets better. Our bill came to $54.84, which another waiter brought us the check, maybe our original waiter saw the sheer look of disgust on my face and didn't want to hand it to us. I wish I could say the mess-ups were over but they continue. Our original waiter hands us the receipt back with our 15 cent change, clearly he couldn't do math since our bill was $54.84, making it 16 cents change. Not that I give a crap about a penny, but at least after completely ruining our evening you could hand us the right change.  Needless to say, this was the worst experience ever.

Normally, I'd be waiting at least half hour to over an hour, so definitely A+ to that. I had my baby with me so they were also very kind enough to give us a nice size booth so the car seat would fit in with us. Service was excellent! Everything we ordered came out at a decent time. For apps, we ordered mini crab bites and these chicken wonton things. Skip the crab bites if u plan on getting them! Extremely overpriced and they were so tiny. The chicken wonton things (forgot the names) was delicious though. It had a somewhat curry taste to it. For main meals, I ordered fish tacos and my husband ordered this spicy pasta with shrimp. They both weren't that great. I ordered my fish tacos tempura style, but when it came out, it was this heavy fried dough. Tempura is supposed to be light. They should not ask if I want it tempura or grilled. It should be wiuld u like it fried or grilled. If I knew it wasn't tempura battered, I would have gone for grilled. The tacos weren't horrible but could have been better if I actually got what I wanted. My husband's pasta was good, but he didn't like it much. He didn't think it had enough spice to it. He said he remembered it differentially. Upon leaving, we decided to order a whole cheesecake. They didn't have it ready and was completely frozen. I was a bit upset bc I couldn't eat it right when I got home, but once defrosted, it was quite delicious!! Go for the banana cream.

It has a hint if garlic, yum. Their alcoholic drinks are made well. Their dessert is good, but eight dollars for a small piece if cake is outrageous! Not worth it, when it costs that much to make an entire cake. Their food is hit or miss. My friend got fish tacos once and then shrimp scampi, and didn't like either. I tasted a friend's French fries, and they were over salted. That's annoying coming from fine dining. My sweet corn tamale cakes were too sweet and lacked a good contrast in textures - the cakes should be crisp with a crunchy exterior, but they were super mushy. I've found their pasta and salad dishes to be the only consistently yummy dishes. The pumpernickel with oats served right away and warm are a favorite as well.  They also don't put the prices on the menu for the alcoholic drinks...not a fan of not knowing what you're getting for the price. If you're going here, I say stick to the classics.

266,Jacquie B.,"Toms River, NJ",35,11,2.0,1.0,2014-03-11,"So disappointed in my visit yesterday.  I've been to the one in Freehold many times, this was my 2nd time to Cherry Hill.  Ordered my favorite dish that I've had at least 5 or 6 times over the years at Freehold - the Wasabi Crusted Tuna.  It's one of the higher prices meals at $22, but so worth it.... But NOT yesterday.  My mother was with me & we both ordered the tuna.  Server was pleasant & attentive, very nice.  Wasn't a long wait to be seated or to get our meals.  It was early - just before 5pm (body clocks at 4pm with daylight savings) - so it was not busy yet.  Meals came & the tuna (which should come rare - as described in menu & how it's always been when I've gotten it before) was cooked well done - I'm talking the look of canned tuna well done!  It happens, our server sees, apologizes & brings both dinners back.  Manager comes over apologizes & says he will assure our meal comes out correct.  Not too long a wait & our waitress is back - the tuna now has BARELY touched the grill & is completely raw & cold - not cool/room temp, like I've ALWAYS had it before, where it has a nice sear on both sides, but red in the CENTER - nope!  Red Raw all around the edges.  I could not cut through it with my dinner knife raw! In the past I've worked at fine dining restaurants, and I know the kitchen can get pissy when food is sent back.  Like it's a personal insult.  I really felt like the Raw Tuna was an FU to us - ""these bitches want rare?  I'll give 'em rare!""   No, what I wanted was it how it is suppose to be prepared!  How I've had it so many times before!  Someone should really get ahold of their staff with attitudes!  Allow me to enlighten the average restaurant patron on something... MOST patrons will take this out on their server - who has NO control over the asshats with egos in the kitchen!  Those very asshats get an hourly wage - they get paid no matter if you like your food or not.  But your server, who bears the brunt of your frustration due to receiving two plates of ill prepared food, gets yelled at, gets the complaints...and usually in the end - gets a crappy tip!  You know they only make $2 -$3 per hour, heck 20 years ago, when I waitresses, I made $2.25 per hour.  They depend on tips! But those asshats in the kitchen get minimum wage at least, most get more!  It's WRONG!!! The waitress apologized again, took the food.  I was over it!  Tried not to take it out on her, I ordered a dinner salad.  Great ""dinner"" at Cheesecake Factory"" - NOT!  Manager came back, apologized, offered to have asshats in kitchen make it a 3RD TIME.  No Thanks!  Spit comes with a 3rd dish, or a swipe on the floor before it hits the grill - I worked in restaurants... I've seen it happen!  I tried to explain this concept to the manager about retaliative kitchen staff(I didn't call them asshats to him), but he replied, ""well, I don't know what kind of restaurants you worked in before, but it's not our policy"". Yeah, NO KIDDING!  It's nobodies policy!  It's the asshat in the kitchen of your upscale CHAIN RESTAURANT, who thinks his mistake is my problem to choke down.  It's his inflated ego, thinking he's actually a ""chef"" who knows how to create new & flavorful, delicious gourmet meals...when in reality, he is a connect the dots ""cook"" - take meat A & add premade sauce B, cook for x minutes with C cooking method - dump on plate!  That's why it's always been good when I had it in the past!  Follow 3 or 4 steps - comes out exactly as it should!  My guess is someone didn't pay attention to the ""x minutes"" the first time - but PURPOSELY under cooked the second time... To show me!  I just wanted it done how it was suppose to be done!   So my mom ate 1/2 her raw fish, saying - I like sushi, and I've never had it before...so I don't know the difference.  Well, I like sushi too...but I didn't order sushi. The waitress got tipped on a dinner & a salad (but they didn't charge me for my salad), even though she technically did the work of waiting on us twice & brought us 4 dinners... So you see, she lost out - her pay was docked....but the ASSHAT in the kitchen will cash his full paycheck on Friday!  It's just wrong!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=180,3.36,3.41,3.41,2.5960000000000005,3.39

I'm always overwhelmed by the mish-mosh of offerings at CF (which seems to match the decidedly un-themed, lavish decor).  This time, I decided to stick to appetizers, allowing me to try a few different things.  We split the fried mac and cheese balls and the crabby bites, which were both delicious.  I then ordered veggie fries (fried avocado, zucchini, and portobellos), which were unfortunately very disappointing.  I've had awesome avocado fries before, but the breading seemed all wrong on these.  Luckily I'd also ordered the pear and blue cheese flatbread, which was excellent - the arugula on top had a lemon-y drizzle that I thoroughly enjoyed.  Despite being stuffed, we couldn't leave without cheesecake, so we ordered it to go. I don't think you can go wrong here, as they're all delicious, but my Adam's peanut butter/caramel/brownie concoction was perfect, and actually lasted two days.

We went here for a special occasion and we were seated immediately; surprisingly,  it wasn't overly packed and/or busy. I did not like our server, Desiree, at all. She had a very flat affect, standoffish attitude, and seemed to pre judge us maybe because we looked young (possibly). I'm not sure, but I'll leave it at that. She walked past our table so many times before introducing herself as our server. We waited patiently and I even went to the bathroom and she still hadn't stopped at the table. She is the worst server at CCF I've had in the past 5 years. Desiree finally asked us about drink orders after about 8 minutes and it took forever for us to receive bread. Desiree may require additional training with serving and cultural diversity. We ordered the Fries Mac and Cheese balls which were scrumptious! For entrees we ordered the Steak Diane with Shrimp Scampi and Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp & Chicken (my absolute fav). I rated the visit a 3 only because the food was very tasty. Now that I think of it, Desiree never even asked how everything tasted or if everything was ok. Sadly, I have to change my rating to a 2. She had absolutely below subpar service. I usually order my Caramel Pecan Turtle cheesecake and eat a little while I'm there and take the rest to go, but I didn't want to increase her tip by anymore because she SUCKED. So I purchased cheesecake at the counter. I usually tip minimum of 20% because I was a former server... The only reason she got over a 15% tip is because I don't believe in not leaving a tip...

I had nothing against the business, but no real desire to lose my chasteness. Now that I am no longer pure, I can honestly say that I can see the appeal this place has on people from all walks of life.  First of all, the decor in this location is quite interesting. We both remarked that it had something like a Disney and or resort-ish effect. For some reason you just feel good, and at ease too. Second, the sheer quantity of choices should be able to appease even the pickiest of the picky. I can't comment on the quality, we were here for dessert only. And last but not least, their namesake option does not disappoint. My friend chose Godiva chocolate, and I opted for salted caramel. What I'm leaving out is that it took us ten minutes to narrow our selection down since the choices are vast. We enjoyed both slices. The tastes were fresh and intense, with lovely plating. Almost as lovely as my desserting companion, but not quite. To sum up, I would recommend CF to families with younguns, or those looking for casual fare with an ending that is sure to be happy.

I remember when there used to be only one cheese cake factory in the area, and that was in King of Prussia. I used to love visiting this chain. However, the quality has gone down significantly. During our most recent visit we ordered the firecracker salmon appetizer, which was pretty tasty, so we were excited to get our entrees. I ordered the jambalaya with white rice (instead of pasta). My boyfriend ordered a special pesto tilapia which came with mashed potatoes, tomatoes, in a pesto sauce. He liked his entree. Mine was below mediocre. My entree arrived and looked like chicken, tomatoes, shrimp, with peppers, and onions on a bed of rice. There was absolutely no spice at all. If I had a stomach virus, I could have eaten this entree with no problem. It was bland, unseasoned, and just a big plate of nothingness. I asked our waitress for extra sauce. I was told it would take a few minutes. A gentleman arrived 10 minutes later with a bowl of hot liquid with more tomatoes. Great, is what I thought until I poured the alleged sauce over the jambalaya. I tasted the entree again and was met with the same disappointment. More blandness with even more tomatoes. I finally asked for a to-go container so I could take the entree home and fix it myself. I sat while my boyfriend finished his food. The waitress returned with a to-go box and never even asked if we liked our entrees. I'm pretty sure she didn't really care to hear what we had to say. She was more interested in offering desert.

Really thin and crunchy fried chicken bites that come with dipping sauces. Really good If your into your wings. Chicken Romano was my last entree and was on the heavier side but was really good. The Oreo cheesecake was a chocolate lovers dream. And the cocktails at this place are exceptional as well. It can be a little pricey but I think that you can work around the pricing by learning the menu. Like to think this is one of the better chains around. So for a chain it's a 4.

Most of their Mexican food is really good and as expected, much better than places like Don Pablo's or On The Border. The cheesecake is obviously this places specialty and they don't disappoint. They have at least 30 different types ranging from the basic to the extreme. My favorite is the Banana cheesecake. Simple yet good. This place is a regular stop for my gf and I. OH!

And yet that's what virtually Everyone comes here for. Seems logical, i know. The decor is nice as usual, but it's getting a bit dated/run-down from all the hordes of patrons. The service is spotty; sometimes you get an energetic smiley server, and sometimes you get an aloof one eager to finish their shift. Once the obscene portions of the food are overlooked, the food is actually pretty good. I am a big fan of non-boring flavors-- bitter, sour, pungent, umami, etc. So that narrows the chain's encyclopedia-sized menu down a bit. I recommend any of the cajun, thai, and comfort-style meat dishes for these types of flavors. Some lemon-based Italian dishes too. I say the comfort dishes (shepherds pie, chicken madeira, chicken & biscuits, etc) due to the umami flavor caused by the jus mixed with the starch.. The Mexican-style dishes are mostly Tex-Mex which are not interesting. Arguably, only a few cheesecakes are really worth getting: purist related. Original, orig. + strawberries, oreo, vanilla bean, white chocolate rasp, & red velvet. That's pretty much it. Nothing too complicated, nothing chocolate-centric--if you wanted to cover up the cheesecake flavor, just get sponge cake.

On the plus side, the food is very tasty, portions are generous and service is usually friendly and attentive.  I love all the varieties of cheesecakes offered, and the cheesecake is pretty good - maybe a little on the dense/dry side for my taste, but still good.  I think the most appealing thing about their cheesecake is that huge number of varieties available.  One of my favorite desserts they serve is not a cheesecake at all - it is the strawberry shortcake (see my photo).  It's a biscuit shortcake piled high with vanilla ice cream, strawberries and whipped cream and it's the bomb.  Be aware - this dessert HUGE and can easily feed 3 people.

Or go to Grand Lux across the street. Their French toast is horrible. I needed a steak knife to cut it! Not cool! They don't use proper bread for french toast it's more like a hard shell sourdough.  For every good meal I have at CF there is always one where their kitchen screws something up. They need new chefs.

This has always been a place I visit at the end of my day, trying to always avoid the crowd. I luv their mojito's and they have a pretty large selection of vegetarian food. Not, just the typical vegetarian meals, but something that took some thought to create. On this visit, my daughter and I came in an hour before closing. I started with my usual pineapple mojito but ended up with two by the end of the night. I decided it was to late to eat a large meal, so I stuck with the small plate menu. I was craving a Greek salad, and it truly can't be appreciated unless you add extra feta cheese, YUM!! I also enjoyed a variety of fried sticks, that included zucchini, avocado and port mushrooms. All fried to perfection with two dipping sauces, I was in veggie heaven. Overall, this was a very healthy and inexpensive meal. The customer service was great and we opted to sit outside, since the AC was blasting. I luv getting those little moments alone with my daughter, she's the best company.

Came here with 11 other friends(not including me) for a surprise birthday dinner after coming from skyzone... so yes expect this review to be more about if me and my friends were filled up! We had balloons which were '18' that we wanted to put on the birthday girl's seat and the employees were very nice about it. We were a big group so I was a little hesitant if one waiter will be able to handle all of us. Starting off with the beverages... I got the Iced Mango Drink($6.50) THIS DRINK IS A MUST HAVE... 10STARS FOR THIS DRINK!! The waiter then proceeded to get the rest of my friends their drinks and their UNLIMITED free bread with butter. Not sure the exact names of the bread but some are white and some are brown. The BROWN ones are the best in my opinion!! Always a fight to see who get the brown one. The wait time was 20-30minutes but it was expected as we were a large group but the unlimited bread complemented the wait time with jokes and story telling between my friends.  The food all came out at the same time which was good because no one wants their food to get cold while waiting for their friend to get their meal. For the main dish I got the Shrimp Bistro($18.50) with shredded cheese on top. AMAZING.... usually people look for the shrimp taste but I rather eat the pasta without the shrimp. The pasta was soooooo creamy and delightful. This has to be the BEST pasta I have every tasted in my entire life. After we finished, the employees sang happy birthday to the birthday girl and handed a Cheesecake to her.  The food did fill me and my friends up... I had to take the left over pasta home.

The salad I ordered was my issue. I found a fly in my salad. I called the waitress to the table and she offered to replace the item. The manager visited our table and offered to replace the salad. At that point of the meal I couldn't get the thought of the dead fly out of my mind. The issue was when the bill was brought to our table I was charged for the salad. After I complained again it was removed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=60,3.04,3.44,3.44,2.5960000000000005,3.2800000000000007

We were here this past Thursday for an early dinner. I like this location. The server was extremely pleasant and helpful. We started with the crab cakes and the mozzarella wedges. The crab cakes were delicious and packed with crab meat, I actually bit into a shell. The mozzarella was just as good. Very fresh and not your typical fried junk. For entrees we went with the chipotle chicken sandwich and the turkey burger. Often turkey burgers are dry, not this one. The burger was amazing! Moist and flavorful, I did seek a bit of spice. The chicken sandwich was also very good but it was very very large and heavy. The chicken was a bit on the greasy side but hey it's fried chicken. The buns on both were perfectly toasted. We opted for salad instead of fries. The citrus dressing is to die for!  We will be back! 4 stars..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill,3.04,3.43,3.43,2.8960000000000004,3.274

Was told the wait would be 20 minutes but only ended up being 10. Sweet! We were then seated and sat and waited for 15 minutes until someone came over to our table. Turns out we just so happened to be seated at a ""change of shift"" time. Um, what? I've never even heard of that at a restaurant in all my years on this earth. Anyway, by the time our waitress realized we were waiting, we were ready to order our food. She didn't even ask what we wanted to drink. After finally getting our drinks, our complimentary bread came to the table. The honey wheat was good, but the Italian bread was soooo hard and crusty I couldn't even chew it. Completely inedible. I'm all for crusty, hearty bread but this was insane. Fast forward to appetizer.. delicious! We got the crab wontons, they were fresh and hot and tasty. Now, on to my main dish. Sigh. I ordered the fish tacos and the plate was at-best lukewarm when it got to the table. The ingredients in the tacos were weird. It almost had a sour/bitter taste and the ingredients were piled into the taco so high that it was difficult to pick up and eat. The black beans were salty and the rice that was served with it was so weird. I can't even explain the flavor, all I know is it didn't go with the dish. Should I also mention the tables? They have so many tables crammed in there, when the girls next to us got up to leave their bodies were actually touching our table because there simply was not enough room to get by. We could hear their conversations and I'm sure they could hear ours. I was probably sitting 12 inches away from our neighbors. So much for an intimate dining experience.

When we got buzzed for a table, we were seated in the far corner of the restaurant (awkward spot where there were A LOT OF FLIES!!! EW) and on our way to the table, there were so many empty tables that had not been cleared/cleaned (this could be what is attracting flies? and causing a wait at an off hour?).  I ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta... and it was so terrible... it was pasta floating in so much oil that I caught myself SLURPING the three bites that I took!  I ended up just eating the chicken cutlet part of it.  My cousin got an everything pizza... and it looked and tasted like a frozen pizza that was not microwaved all the way! The cheese looked like individual shredded pieces that did not melt... and I heard loud crunching as she bit into the crust (which was not ""crispy"" but more from being stale).  Our waitress was so hard to get a hold of and with all the flies, we were just anxious to get out of there.  She never made eye contact or asked how our food was, just dropped off the check and walked away quickly.  I will not be returning to this location and certainly do NOT recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=20,3.2,3.39,3.424,2.7560000000000002,3.314

However, it's hard to describe how disappointing today's lunch visit was in this Cherry Hill Location. We were seated quickly, as the restaurant was not too crowded. Our waiter, Eric, was friendly when he took our drink order, and gave us plenty of time to study the menu. I did not realize that was probably because time apparently didn't matter to him. We made a simple order--Asian lettuce wrap apps, a macaroni and cheese burger (medium well), and a soup and salad.  Eric left, and two other couples came in and were seated near us. We sat and waited for our appetizer, and time started ticking away. The appetizer took FOREVER to come out, and Eric apologized for the wait. We were fine with that. Then, it came time to wait for the meal. We waited and waited, and watched the other two couples receive their meals. They had burgers and salads too. Their burgers had so much meat that they looked like they did not fit on the bun. Their salads had lots of fresh looking veggies, and their burger came with an abundance of fries on the plate. Eric walked by several times, but never with any food for us. He apologized again for the wait, and left and came back, but still did not have our food.  We had been in the restaurant an hour at this point. Eric walked by again, and I said, ""any luck yet?"" He said, ""Yes, soon."" I said, ""I don't understand, those two couples came in and ordered long after we did, and are almost through with their food. We only ordered soup and salad and a burger. I don't understand the delay.""  Eric left, and the next time we saw him he had our food. I look at my husband's burger. It was half the size of the bun, and look like it was cooked to the point of being a hockey puck. There were no fries on the plate, and Eric said the fries will be right out. Eric lay down my stupid salad as well, the soup looks fabulous but the salad was nothing but greens tossed in a light dressing. I was surprised that there was not even a cucumber or tomato or a shredded piece of carrot in sight.  My husband and I just looked at each other stunned, and started eating. He could barely chew his char-burnt burger that was supposed to be medium well. Several minutes later a table runner brought out a small cup of cold french fries.   My husband and I were quiet the rest of the meal, and did not see Eric again for a while. No asking how the food was, no offers for refills, nothing. He finally showed up, and spoke just one word, ""desserts?"" My husband and I responded simultaneously with a somber ""no"". Eric quietly gave us our check in and we paid and left.

Either your sitting in Cheesecake Factory and waiting for your waitress or you're really interested in someone's opinion who you really don't care about. Either way thanks for reading! Stopped by on Saturday around 10:30pm. There was no wait. We got sat immediately. There was a big woman sitting by herself on her phone. To the left of us and a couple making out at the bar. A no name boxing match was on. I will reveal who won the fight (4 time welterweight champion vs some guy, spoiler alert someone got knocked out round 3).  We got drinks. I got a smashing whiskey something. It was delicious. My wife got a blue moon. Drinks came out very quickly. We skipped appetizers and went right in for the kill. Unfortunately even with no crowd the wait time for our food was 30+ minutes. Do not go here if you are in a rush.  I got the steak Diane and chicken medeina which is apparently their favorite dish as a combo. My wife got the chicken parm pizza lol. The calories weren't listed because in sure listing a 3500 calorie bomb should be illegal. Mine was good. Steak was perfectly cooked and the chicken was moist. I like the cheese on top. When the mashed potatoes with the skin were to die for. The waitress never asked if we wanted a second drink. Oh well her loss! When we finished I couldn't find my waitress. We waited another 20 minutes before she emerged. I asked for a check and a box for the remaining 2/3 of the chicken parm pizza (which was essentially a huge patty of chicken covered in pizza sauce with some noods on top).  She asked if we wanted dessert and oh yeah we're at the Cheesecake Factory! I ordered the classic with the cherry preserves with some ice cream. It came out with two dollops of whipped cream! I totally forgot! Too much cream. I'm lactose intolerant. I would regret this choice.  Bill came out to $68. Not bad. If we didn't order drinks we'd have been okay. At least we shared dessert! Still working off those calories. The waitress took another 10 minutes to come over after we finished dessert. She immediately got the check then walked away (should've waited the 3 seconds for me to give her my cc) 20 minutes go by and I finally see her chatting up another waiter. I literally need to waive the check bill in the air to flag her down before she realizes I'm ready.  We leave by 12:10am. Could've been done in 30 minutes but I could never find the waitress. That is why they get a 3 star rating rather than 5. Other times they have been way quicker. The boxer won by knockout in the first 3 rounds. He essentially won before our food came out!

This was a better experience than the Baltimore store, but the food is very generic and nothing I would ever say, ""Hey, you have to have this dish.""  You can visit and find something that isn't horrible and overpay for it.  Other than that, I'll pass from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill,3.12,3.36,3.42,,3.2640000000000007

After letting the waitress know, she was very friendly and offered to correct the issue.  Apparently though, my order went to the very back of the line again since it took about another 45 minutes before I received my corrected order.  By the time I got my food, the rest of my party was finished eating and ready to go.  So let's hope the food tastes okay reheated since my dinner out involved picking scraps of food from the rest of my party.   The manager did come by to say ""Sorry about how long it's taking.  The kitchen is very busy tonight"".  While I don't expect the manager to give free food because mistakes do happen...but ANYTHING, even an appetizer or more bread would have been nice...rather than begging for leftovers from my companions.  The scraps of food I had were tasty though and our waitress was very friendly.   Manager definitely could have handled the situation better considering after around two hours waiting, I never did get to eat what I ordered. Update:  While my experience with this location was lackluster...I have to say that Cheesecake Factory corporate did an excellent job.  The Guest Relations Department with corporate read my review and contacted me right away.  They apologized and asked for additional details to allow them to investigate the problem to prevent such occurrences from happening to others.  The fact that they actually read online reviews and address potential issues is impressive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=20,3.16,3.37,3.424,,3.286

9,Mary T.,"Glassboro, NJ",0,8,5.0,2.0,2017-09-26,"I really went back and forth with myself over writing this review, but I feel obligated to forewarn other guests. My friend and I stopped here for a late dinner after work on Sunday, and it wasn't as busy as it usually is when I go. We had a wait of barely 5 minutes, and were sat in a little corner.  I totally understand that servers work for tips, and sometimes it's hard not to judge people based on appearance, but this is probably the first time that I've felt that what I was wearing significantly effected the quality of my service. Mistake number one, was wearing jeans and a T-shirt. I felt like we were stashed in a corner to not take away from the overall vibe of little dates and dinner gatherings that were going on around us.  Our server brought us out two waters and greeted us, ran down dinner and drink specials and asked if we'd like to put in an appetizer or get anything else to drink. In retrospect, this was where we made mistake number two. My friend decided to just go with water, no alcohol to bump up the tab, and told him she was gong to have an appetizer as her entree. We asked for a few more minutes, as I hadn't decided on a dinner yet. This was the turning point of our visit.  The soda that I ordered took about 20 minutes to come out, when he then asked if we'd like bread while we wait. The bread took another 10-ish minutes, and the meal came almost immediately afterwards. No inquiry about a refill on any drinks, and we didn't personally have his attention after the food was dropped for about another 45 minutes. However, he was gushing over the table seated immediately next to us, who appeared to be on a date. They ordered alcohol, appetizers, meals and were dressed very nicely. He stopped two or three times to have full 3-5 minute conversations with them, while totally ignoring us. No three bite check in, no refills, nothing. He was consistently present and attentive to his other tables, just not us.  Maybe he thought we were a couple and didn't like that? Maybe the casual, young adult in jeans and a messy bun appearance causes unintentional judgement because we look like we don't tip well? Maybe our not ordering $100 worth of food made him feel as though we were a waste of time? In reality, we were saving room for the $50 in cheesecake that we wound up ordering at the take away counter, because two hours for a quick meal was too long to be there already, and if we didn't ask for the check when we did, who knows when we would have seen him again. We didn't drive 30 minutes to this establishment to be treated worse than a minimum wage fast food worker would have treated us. On top of everything else the bathroom was a disaster. Do better, Cheesecake Factory. This was such a disappointment. We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill,3.12,3.36,3.408,,3.2640000000000007

Don't understand the appeal.  Finally sat at tiny table for 2.  The noise level was unreal.  Had to practically shout at the waiter to be heard.  Forget trying to converse with my date.  Then they lowered the lights. I could barely see what I was eating.  The food was actually good but no plans to go back there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=20,3.2,3.38,3.424,,3.3080000000000007

First off, the service was great.  They were kind and considerate.  The server recommended their favorites and they were all great suggestions.  They were capable of answering questions about their extensive menu. Many of the pastas are great choices, but read the description to make sure you enjoy what it contains.  I would recommend the cauliflower apitizer, it will surprise you in both bold taste and melt in your mouth texture.  I would not recommend the cheeseburgers for those who do not like greesy burgers.  The cheesecake is fine, but can be overwhelmingly sweet.  Recommended to share a slice. The pricing is a little high, but to be expected for the location and food portions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill,3.28,3.41,3.424,,3.358

47,Kathy S.,"Pennsauken Township, NJ",0,18,6.0,2.0,2017-12-03,"I just got home from a big family brunch at the Cheesecake Factory. It was probably my last visit. There was a ridiculously long wait for the food. I did enjoy my pancakes, which were served with only a tiny cup of syrup. My tomato juice was sour. Others needed more coffee, and were complaining about not having enough syrup. There was a long wait for the server to come back, then another long wait for coffee, syrup, and to have my sour tomato juice replaced with supposedly fresh squeezed orange juice. I stopped eating for quite some time, because I had nothing to wash down dry pancakes. The orange juice at least wasn't spoiled, but I have a hard time believing it's fresh squeezed, when my supermarket brand orange juice that comes in half gallon cartons tastes much better. I understand that people are busy, but the service was so horrible that meal should have been comped.

1,Prashasti A.,"Philadelphia, PA",152,95,107.0,1.0,2018-01-07,"Yikes! My family comes to the Cheesecake Factory frequently but each visit has slowly decreased our appetite for the restaurant. The menu changes frequently, each time cutting more and more vegetarian options.  We went for a late lunch and alas, there was a wait. We expected as much.  After being seated, our server came out with water for the table but no straws. I had to actually ask for straws? (Question mark for the incredulous tone of the statement) We were waiting on two more people, so I had asked for the appetizers to be brought out when everyone had arrived but he replied that we would have to wait until everyone was here to order them or we could order them now and he would bring it out when it was ready. I don't think our request was too complicated but still, unfulfilled. After the rest of the group arrived, we ordered out meals.  Because the menu had changed since our last visit, my parents asked for the vegetarian dishes (my mom's favorite falafel salad was cut), and he said they had 3 vegetarian dishes. Now, I don't claim to know the entire menu at the CF but I know for a fact that they have more than 3 vegetarian meals. What's up with that? She decided to order the tomato basil pasta, the vegetarian version. Also, please note that this was an entire conversation, and not a simple Q & A. Our server knows very well that my parents do not eat meat. After some time, he brings the food to the table and doesn't even notice the empty waters. Once again, we had to ask for more water???  Lo and behold, the tomato basil pasta my mother ordered has chicken in it. We flag him down and ask is this chicken? He says yes. He then proceeds to ask if it's ok that the kitchen remove the chicken and bring the same food back. Personally, I was offended that this even happened in the first place. But then he has the audacity to ask if she wants the same meal, minus the chicken? WTF? It would be one thing if she had asked for the tomato basil pasta without chicken but after the conversation where they asked him for a vegetarian menu and whatnot, it was absolutely unacceptable, and he did not even seem apologetic. Honestly, it feels like he was trying to spite us or something because nothing made sense. I know for a fact that this was the Final visit to the Cheesecake factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill,3.52,3.38,3.456,,3.4360000000000004
