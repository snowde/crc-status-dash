25,Elizabeth K.,"Saint Charles, MO",142,1,,1.0,2017-07-21,"I would not waste your money or your time.  Decided to buy my team lunch today from one of their favorite restaurants so I placed an order for carry out was put on hold for over 10 minutes, then hung up on so I called back and the lady was very rude on the phone who took the order. When we picked up our food the lady just shoved the bags at me and there was so many people around you couldn't even move, by the time I got back toThe store across the store the food was cold and disgusting. Half of our food was not correct. We didn't get any of the condiments we asked for. One girl asked for french fries with cheese and was given fried cheese and the manager said that she was given fried cheese because if she was given what she ordered it would of been soggy. We took our food back up there to return it and get a refund and the manager refused to refund our money and said that part of the food was eaten and that's actually how it was packed. The manager was extremely rude and was rushing around like he didn't want to be bothered. He almost wasn't even going to replace the food that we had that was messed up because he acted like it was such an inconvenience that we brought it back up. This place is overpriced and disgusting even McDonald's doesn't act that! Our company will never return to this establishment and we will never recommend it to any of our clients in that area. I literally took the food and spit it into the trash what a waste.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chesterfield?start=20,2.44,3.01,3.01,,2.7819999999999996

21,Mary B.,"Wentzville, MO",0,6,,2.0,2017-07-29,"Disappointed in today's visit. 2 of us ordered Salmon which came out burned. I ordered salad with dressing on the side and it came out with dressing on it. We should have had them all re-made but didn't want to wait. Maybe they have new people in the kitchen who don't know what they are doing? However, I can't help but wonder if there is something else going on since the mall itself is struggling. (Except the Cheesecake Factory always seems busy.) The waiter also did not offer to box our leftovers which the wait staff has ALWAYS practically insisted on doing in the past. My leftover salad which I usually enjoy was not very good due to being soggy from sitting in dressing for hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chesterfield?start=20,2.36,2.95,2.95,,2.7140000000000004
3,Patt C.,"Chesterfield, MO",245,945,,2.0,2017-08-17,"This place never bowls me over. I've been to two. Don't need to go again. Stanwyck wanted to go, so we went. She got Thai lettuce wraps and a MASSIVE piece of chocolate mousse cheesecake (took half home). I got the Skinnylicious Hamburger without bun-- came with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles and mayonnaise; and served with a green salad. Stanwyck loved her lettuce wraps -- they are her go-to at The Cheesecake Factory. My burger was the driest, most taste-free burger I've ever had in my life. None of the accoutrements were going to help this poor hockey puck. The salad was A-OK.

9,Andrew L.,"Saint Louis, MO",125,47,21.0,5.0,2017-08-23,"My experience at TCF is always really good. Choosing something from the menu might be the hardest thing ever, literally pages on pages. In my opinion, the Miso Salmon is one of the greatest dishes on the menu, that or the Bistro Shrimp pasta, or even the Chipotle Chicken pasta. If you've never been to TCF, when they ask if you want bread, yes take the bread! The wheat bread is so so good. Tip, don't devour your whole meal, save some room for cheesecake. My favorite is either the Dulce De Leche or the pumpkin pie (seasonal). Now the staff, TCF staff is always friendly and attentive. If something is wrong with your order, the manager will personally swing by your table right away and make things right. My girlfriend though she had found a fingernail towards the end of her meal (bistro shrimp pasta), waiter told his manager, manager came right away and said he'll replace the whole meal & won't charge either (in conclusion the nail turned out to be a shell, but it's hard to tell when it's so dimly lit in there lol).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chesterfield,2.32,2.96,2.96,,2.704
0,Erica M.,"Bloomington, IL",78,168,190.0,5.0,2017-08-26,"I always enjoy my meal at The Cheesecake Factory and this trip was no exception. Meals always start off with their white and brown bread at the table. I consistently eat too much before every meal here. For my main dish I had the grilled cheese and bacon sticks. I believe this is a seasonal dish but I hope they add it to the regular menu because it was delicious. As always, I end my time here with a dessert. On this occasion I got the Funfetti Cake. It was a nice change from the super rich Cheesecake I normally order. This dessert had many layers with combos of different types of cake between. I really enjoyed it. The service was also good here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chesterfield,2.48,2.97,2.97,,2.774
22,Allie K.,"Ballwin, MO",77,3,,1.0,2017-09-07,"Dude. Bad service. Cold food. We waited twenty minutes for her every time we needed something... No joke from the appetizer bread to actual food (which again - was cold) to the Parmesan cheese to the extra napkins. It was just annoying.. We saw her talking at the server station, so us BOTH being waitresses, we get it! Maybe she's new? Maybe she has a sick kid at home? Who knows. But I walked by to go to the bathroom and just overheard her like talking about which dress to wear to something and what colors would work and I just felt a little ignored and put on the back burner. I seem to continuously be reaffirmed on my opinion of cheesecake factory. Lazy, annoying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chesterfield?start=20,2.44,2.94,2.94,,2.74
2,Jason B.,"Chesterfield, MO",228,27,1.0,1.0,2017-11-05,"Rarely would I give a major chain restaurant such a bad review. Especially when their food is pretty good, and their cheesecakes are to die for. But tonight we had an exceptionally unpleasant time at the Cheesecake Factory in Chesterfield, MO.  We walked in and immediately thought that something was wrong, as the lighting was VERY dim, more so than usual (This is probably our third time dining there). It was to the point we could barely make out each other's faces and if it weren't for a single spot light aimed at the center of the table, we would not be able to read the menus. We complained, and were brought two battery operated candles which did not produce any usable light whatsoever. When we asked to speak to the manager we were informed that he gets lots of complaints about it, but it's corporate's direction to keep the lights that dim. It created an unpleasant experience for my wife and I, and creates a hazardous workplace for the wait staff.  As a photographer, I certainly understand the importance of lighting, and using it to set a mood, but this was just dark, dangerous and unpleasant. In addition to us, I notice many other patrons using their cellphone lights to read the menus. Come on, Cheesecake Factory, Take a hint and turn on the lights. Even if just enough for your patrons to read the menus and enjoy the company of their group.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chesterfield,2.32,2.92,2.92,,2.68
1,Allison Z.,"Saint Louis, MO",8,78,47.0,1.0,2017-12-14,"We have visited this place about couple times before. It was always on the verge of being barely 3, and frankly not worth my time to write review about. Today though, it is. Entered the restaurant at 515, the place on Thursday night was half empty, but we still had to wait to be seated. Anyways, we waited about a few minutes before we were led to our seat. The main character, our waitress, came. She started with asking what we want, asked for milk, coke and ice tea. I looked at the table and said are we getting the bread? She gave me a look for a second, the look of asking ""how dare you want bread"", then actually asked you want bread??? I mean why the f would you even ask? Has your management changed so much that now I can't just expect you to bring it over but have to beg for it? We waited about 5 minutes on our drink, which wasn't bad thus far. We asked for a few more minutes on the menu, which really ended being another 10 minutes before we can order. That makes it 530pm. I didn't believe we ordered anything outrageously difficult to cook, but having their kitchen to produce the food seems a challenge (2 appetizers, 2 meals, and a slice of cake). Again, the restaurant was still half empty. 25 mins passed away, we did not get a fucking thing, let alone our much needed refill. The miss waitress might as well be napping else where. The table on our right who came in right after us was about to be done with their food (they had a different server), the table on our left who came in few minutes later was also losing patient on this whole ridiculousness. The lady finally stood up and summoned a different waitress who could summon our dear waitress to kindly refill our drink, and maybe do her due diligent on checking on the food. We got our appetizers. I went mad. I had a baby with who was losing the cool. Husband took baby back so we can feed her some other real food right before she pass out with empty stomach, and I was about to have a happy talk to their manager at 615. It was her lucky day - miss waitress came with the food and a check, and of course forgot my cheesecake. I did not have the patient to stay their for one more second. I madly put down precisely how much I owe this restaurant, and left this fucking place. I have no intention to return, ever. This wouldn't necessarily be the most unpleasant dining experience in my life, after all, they produce religiously ""Cheesecake Factory"" quality food. I make way better cheesecake and the only reason I would buy theirs is no one in the household could eat more than one slice. Forget about Cheesecake Factory, and their sad, arrogant, likely underpaid waiters, unless your life is filled with hours of hunger that you don't mind sitting there and chewing ice out of empty glasses.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chesterfield,2.32,2.88,2.88,,2.656
