57,Wendy L.,"San Francisco, CA",18,130,36.0,3.0,2012-02-04,"I found a coupe of things on the menu to stick with because every time I try something new I tend to be disappointed here.  APPETIZERS Buffalo Blasts - these are the bomb!!!! It's like like a buffalo chicken rangoon! must try Spinach & Artichoke dip - your average dip but it's still pretty delicious Samosas - not exactly authentic Indian but tasty. I like the thin crispy skin ENTREES Chicken Bellagio - two huge breaded chicken cutlets with linguine all over a creamy pesto sauce. Best thing ever added to the menu a couple years ago....it's 2 meals for me but so good. Only $13 Miso Salmon - glazed baked salmon over a bed of rice topped with sweet and creamy miso dressing. This is better than what I've had at Asian restaurants. CHEESECAKE Red Velvet Cheesecake - this is hands-down the best one ever!!!!!! It's unique, it's not too cheesy and not too heavy.  The service is so so here nothing special and nothing to complain about. When they are busy they are less attentive which is expected but in general a typical Cheesecake chain. Parking is convenient and the outdoor seating is nice in the summer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill?start=80,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.572,2.8

From start to finish, our meal was efficient.  The serving staff at this restaurant moves around very quickly yet we never felt rushed. The only issue is that it's hard to get from one end of the restaurant to the other to use the restrooms because there are so many people waiting in the pathways in the lobby area.

74,Mary C.,"Boston, MA",6,50,,1.0,2012-05-23,"The food at all the Cheesecake factories taste the same, so I will not rate the food. What I am rating here is the terrible and horrible service. From start to finish everything is slow. My sister called in to make reservations for 13, Saturday night at 7:00PM. The manager there Stacy, made an exception for us so we had ""reservations"". I checked in at the front desk and told them i had reservations....for 7:00PM. I was told it'll be a 30-45 minute wait. But wait...don't we have reservations why would we have to wait? Apparently no one at the front desk knew Stacy had made this exception. And finally when Stacy did realize we were there and checked in....we've been waiting for a good 20 minutes already. 7:20...7:30...7:45..8:00....we did not get seated until an hour after our FAKE RESERVATIONS! This is unacceptable. A table of about our size gets there at 7:45 and they get seated before we do. Terrible! Either take reservations or don't! Because my family would've happily went elsewhere and made REAL RESERVATIONS so we didn't have to wait an hour to eat. I've had bad experiences at this specific location before and normally they offer complimentary slices of cheesecake to make up for it, but we didn't get didly. It was my grandmother's birthday atleast send out a special slice for her! nope nada. Don't come here unless you have time to chill at the cheesecake factory. Plan to spend an hour waiting to sit to down and then another 30 minutes for your food, and then another 30 minutes just trying to flag your waitress down for the bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill?start=120,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.244,2.8

My friend and his brother arrived at 5 for an early dinner.  When we arrived we were quickly seated.  I started with a Mojito without the simple syrup.  It was actually quite good and muddled to perfection.  Yum! Next was my meal, I ordered the Chicken Piccata, i decided to go without the pasta and opted for a side of asparagus instead.  It was flavorful and a great size in the lunch portion, leaving room for a delicious Limoncello Cream Torte. This was recommended to me by Tanya and it was amazing.  It wasn't to heavy or too sweet and the citrus flavor was perfect.

41,Ilya E.,"Somerville, MA",85,66,13.0,1.0,2012-07-31,"Let's see, we came here for Sunday brunch....my main complaint is that I was stupid enough to eat and drink here for 3 hours before ending up at Yard House at Legacy Place in dedham (a SUBSTANTIALLY superior dining/brunch experience). I ordered sliders for food, and was constantly pressured to order more food, even though their sliders are essentially 3 overcooked (despite asking for PINK center) mini burgers with no toppings and bun that came out of a plastic bag a few minutes ago. While I was waiting for Burger King delivery from their kitchen, I was treated to ambivalent service from our waitress who pressured us for more food, but kept forgetting our drinks. I also had 2 bloody mary's which tasted 'skunky' (not sure how you do that) but I suspect their tomato juice went bad and overall it was a terrible experience. The fact that it was sunny out and I was in good company saved the experience, but despite the fact that we were the only people there, Cheesecake Factory managed to screw up something so basic as Sunday Brunch in suburbia. The only redeeming quality about this place is that you can observe suburban russian jewish girls here, discussing #firstworldproblems and talking about their plans to marry a financial analyst that went to brandeis and their plans to go get drunk in Boston.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill?start=80,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.212,2.76
123,Shiva M.,"CHESTNUT HILL, MA",1,15,,1.0,2012-07-31,"I grew up in Chestnut Hill and have been to this Cheesecake Factory a few times. Overall it's been ok from what I remember ten years ago. The last time I went there was a couple of years ago with my sis and it was quite a baffling experience. We were seated quickly and given menus. However, although we saw a waiter attend to all the customers immediately around us, he never once came to my table. My sis and I waited 45 minutes for service, watched the people around us being attended to, while we were blatantly ignored. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but I will say that the only difference between us and all the patrons around us were that we were the only visible minorities. Anyway, I spoke briefly with the manager about what the rules of his establishment were in terms of who could be served and who could not be. He gave some insincere apology about what happened to us and offered to send gift certificates for us to return. It was pretty clear that he couldn't care less about our experience and in fact we never saw those gift certificates. My advice: If you're black, Latino, Indian, Asian, or any other minority, don't bother with this place. You'll get much better treatment just about anywhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill?start=160,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.308,2.68
131,Stephen L.,"Quincy, MA",58,19,,1.0,2012-09-03,"Came here this past Sunday for Brunch this past Sunday (09-02-12). I have to say, service was pretty bad. We were seated promptly and things just went down hill from there. We placed our orders for drinks and food. Our food didn't come out in time, which we didn't mind at first, until we realized that the party that came 15 minutes after got served their drinks, bread, and food before us. Our server seemed careless, forgetful, or she just didn't care much. We politely reminded her about the bread on 4 separate occasions, but it didn't come out until after our entrees were served. Meal was okay, not great or memorable, I've had better at different locations. I wasn't irritated until I politely made a suggestion to the manager that his servers need to memorize things a little better. His reply was a simple ""okay"" and just walked away. No wonder why the rest of his staff seemed careless, because the manager didn't care. Perhaps the reason is because they know the location is closing down, but it doesn't excuse the service we received, I expected better service from an established restaurant such as this.

So what happened?  Well, we arrived at the hotel, and there's a Cheesecake Factory right across the street.  Now my companions, being lower on the cultural food chain than esteemed yelpers such as ourselves, went gaga, and begged me to reconsider my chain complaint.  And, shamefacedly, I immediately did, when I realized my per diem for dinner would cover both the Jambalaya and a piece of cheesecake.  Don't worry, I flogged myself later for giving in. So now you know that this place is one of my guilty pleasures.  I mean, you can't offer me Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel cheesecake, or on this visit, Caramel Pecan Turtle cheesecake, and expect me to resist.  This was my first time with the Turtle, and whoa was it freaking delicious.  I am sure it's one of the worst things for you to eat, but hey, without stuff like this what's the point of living? This particular location was nice.  It's on the lower level of the mall, and they were able to seat us immediately on a Wednesday night.  We had great service for our party of 8, and everyone was very happy with what they ordered.  Especially those of us who indulged in the cheesecake.  Down here in Georgia, these places are always madhouses, so it was nice to be able to walk into one and look at the cakes without being jostled by a bunch of people.  For the record, I may have just been insanely hungry, but the jambalaya pasta came out better here than I have ever had it before.  Simply wonderful!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill?start=60,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.7039999999999997,2.68

42,Lauren L.,"Fall River, MA",48,176,12.0,4.0,2013-02-15,"Well, I'd never been to Cheesecake Factory before, but my boyfriend thought this would be a great Valentine's Day dinner location. Yeah, him and about half of outlying Boston, apparently. We got there around 730 and were told it would be roughly a half-hour wait to be seated. Taking the initiative, and because I was excessively thirsty, we made our way to the bar and self-seated immediately at a four-seater high-top with a view of the Minnesota/Wisconsin game. It took a while for a server to find us, but that's more than excusable on a holiday. Our server, Rachel, was a gem. Funny, informative and very attentive, she was always in the periphery if we needed her. We started with a chocolate martini - not on the menu, but they'll make it for you - and a Long Island iced tea, plus waters and the quintesential bread basket.  Head's up to the bread baker, and I know they have one because I saw a guy walking around with a giant platter of breads, but that is the hardest, least palatable Italian loaf I have tasted that wasn't on the clearance rack at Stop and Shop. The multi-grain was fantastic, though, and we devoured it before our apps. Word to the wise, this is an amazing date location. We shared a Boston Cobb salad, which was well garnished and portioned appropriately to share. We then had the Hibachi steak, and OH GOD, can you say perfect medium rare? The best temperature for a skirt steak, which I know it was, but hey, cooked with that marinade the cut was great. The wasabi mash, tempura asparagus and roasted mushrooms were perfect. Delectable. Amazing and fantastic, and we have half of it in the fridge because there was just so much. We got two slices of cheesecake to go, thanks to Rachel's suggestions. Coffee and the end of the basketball game were compliments of the manager, whose name I never got. A very pleasant, smiling lady, and I appreciated her attentiveness. This business is in the Atrium Mall, and while the rest of the structure is vacant, I hope they stick around. First visit but not the last!

I usually go for a dinner at this place once in 3 month or so. I usually get steak and i have no complains.  But I was very disappointed the last time I went to. Fried calamari for appetizer were delicious. And I love garlic sauce they offer with it. As for my main course I  decided to order something else and went for Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane. I got way too much sauce on my plate, I couldn't taste anything beside that sauce. If they would put a decent amount of sauce I would love that dish. But unfortunately that wasn't the case.  As for my friend we went with Chicken Bellagio. Originally dish was served with pasta but he change it to rise.

Got here at 9PM and the host gave us an option to sit where ever so we ended up sitting at a high top table and was served by Shane. He seemed pretty rushy and observing what tables he had I could understand he had a big party full of guys and a couple high tops (including us) and a few booth tables. He took our drink orders- I had the peach smoothie and my brother had the tropical smoothie. DELICIOUS! He brought out bread, but it was missing the sour dough white bread and I didnt really like the wheat brown ones and was pretty disappointed and noticed the next table that came in had both. Another server had brought our drinks over since it was sitting at the bar counter for about 5 minutes. Our server then ran over while our drinks were being placed down and the way he asked what we were going to order I felt rushed. He didn't ask us if we had questions or needed a few more minutes, more like ""What have you guys decided on for food?"" Uhhh ok.  My brother already ate so he just ordered loaded potato tots and I ordered the chicken alfredo. When the food finally arrived, once again the same lady ran our food and I'm just confused as to why is she catering to us? Might as well have her serve us then? His big table was pretty much done and I see him attending to his other tables and to our right there's some staff that is either on break or just ended their shifts and I see him chit chatting. Dont get me wrong, I understand y'all had a long days work and barely had a break, but work is work and its rude to ""neglect"" your guests. What I am the most upset about was when he came over to check up on us and I asked our server if he could pack the rest to go, his response was ""Sure, but did you want me to bring a box for you to pack it yourself?"" Wow. Speechless. As a server myself that IS horrible hospitality. First of all, what did you really do throughout our whole entire visit? 2 second table visits for the max 5-6 times, did not run any of our food/drink, busy attending ""more important guests"" (pretty much 3+ more guests because their table equals more tip?), and chit chatting. Just because its only 2 people with almost $40 worth of food, you don't think we are worth your time? That's how we felt the entire time here tonight. Tipped him 15%, but I felt he didn't even deserve that percentage due to poor service and it annoys me how servers automatically assume whatever the check total will be they think they will get a minimum of 20% gratuity off it. Shane was nice, but his service needs some improvements and not just asking to take our orders and checking up here and there. I shouldn't have to pack the rest of my food when I go out to enjoy my day off from doing that to my own guests!

For the longest time, to me, dessert at the Cheesecake Factory meant their luscious and light banana cream cheesecake.  But now, finally, there's a serious contender for my precious tummy real estate and dessert calorie count - the smooth and sweet lemon meringue cheesecake... yum! There are worse things to be troubled with than which terrific slice of cheesecake to order! *** 10/2014 visit *** Come here for their terrific honey wheat bread, which is particularly good when served warm, and some delicious cheese cake.  If you need something else, consider the Hibachi Steak $19.95 ~ Certified Angus Hanger Steak with Shiitake Mushrooms, Onions, Bean Sprouts, Wasabi Mashed Potatoes and Tempura Asparagus.  Sure the meat portion was rather light on my plate, but what meat there was was cooked medium rare as requested, tender, and so tasty with the sweet marinade. The chicken was tender and tasty in the Chicken Madeira $17.95 ~ Our most popular chicken dish! Sautéed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese. Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce and Served with Mashed Potatoes.   Although it seemed the smallest plate at the table, which was also graced by the pretty layered Luau Salad ~ Grilled Chicken Breast Layered with Mixed Greens, Cucumbers, Green Onions, Red and Yellow Peppers, Green Beans, Carrots, Mango and Crisp Wontons with Macadamia Nuts and Sesame Seeds. Tossed in Our Vinaigrette.  The Famous Factory Meatloaf, Served with Mashed Potatoes, Gravy, Grilled Onions and Corn Succotash was pretty good, though higher accolades went to the variation at Rox Cafe. Entrees rate a 4 here. Annoyingly, they don't seat you till the whole party is there. *** 10/2015 *** The warm crab and artichoke dip app $11.95 was pretty good.  The eggplant parmesan rounds surprisingly arrived alternated with breaded and fried mushroom caps.  The Hibachi Steak $19.95 was still quite good and well worth ordering. For lunch a number of their menu items are available at a luncheon portion for a price that topped out at $14.50 for the salmon vs $18.95/$19.95 .  But consider your appetite.  The DC who ordered the dinner portion of the Luau Salad was the sole member of our party to finish their meal (not inclusive of the one who ordered the mac & cheese burger $13.50). For birthdays, if the birthday boy/girl selects a dessert, they'll decorate the plate.  If no dessert is selected, they'll bring out a scoop of ice cream with whipped cream and embarrass him/her with the staff singing a birthday song. *** 10/2016 *** HUGE Apple Crisp dessert!  Generous for 2.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill?start=20,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.804,2.88

My eggs were moderately warm.  They probably would have been served hot if the server/bus person hadn't walked around the restaurant for 3 to 5 minutes trying to find our table.  Someone couldn't give them a table number??? The next big issue was that I received my toast both dry as dirt and burnt as did my wife.  I had to ask twice for butter which resulted in us getting 3 slices of butter.  I did not realize The Cheesecake Factory was so hard up that they couldn't butter toast and tried to prevent customers from doing so.  Our waitress reappeared at check time but was sorely missed when we needed her!

When we were finally seated it then took about 10 minutes for our waitress to even come and take our drink order. When she took our drink order it took about another 15 minutes for her to then bring them to us. By the time she returned we were ready to order both our appetizers and entrées. Our food took about 30 minutes to come out, and when it did it was lukewarm, and very dry. Our waitress barely came over to our table to check in with us, and when she did she would forget things that we had asked her for. After the horrible meal we ordered dessert, since that's what The Cheesecake Factory is mostly known for. After ordering it then took another 20 minutes to receive our already made desserts.

I'll definitely hit this place up again on my future trips to the shops at Chestnut Hill.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill,3.2,2.9,2.9,,3.0200000000000005
17,Gabrielle M.,"Boston, MA",77,1,,5.0,2017-03-31,"I usually go to the cheesecake location in Braintree but we came to the chestnut hill location tonight. I came here with my boyfriend on a Friday night. We only had a 15 minute wait for the 2 of us. We were seated promptly and brought drinks and bread. The food was amazing, we ordered the fettuccini alfredo with chicken and the mac n cheese burger. For dessert we ordered the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake which was fabulous. Our waiter, John was incredibly friendly and gave us great service. Excellent food, excellent services, and reasonable price. We will definitely be returning!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill,3.2,2.93,2.93,,3.0380000000000003
11,Eli s.,"Brookline, MA",0,87,,2.0,2017-05-02,"Food was as expected. It tasted, you know, pretty good. Flavors were definitely there. Portion sizes were shockingly large. For example, my mother got a main dish that she shared with three other people at the table. We then brought it home and had a dinner for two the following night. That means two things.  1) what quality meat are they using if the can afford to make close to 6 portions out of one $13 dish? 2) cheesecake factory is unhealthy Cheesecake slices range from ~1000-1600 calories per slice. That is also unhealthy. Now, if you add an appetizer and a drink to your meal.. forget super size me.. you wouldn't last a whole month. Cheesecake factory. Get your act together. Make your portions healthier (smaller). The skinny menu is a good start but your core menu has to be healthier.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill,3.24,2.91,2.91,,3.0420000000000007

It did not disappoint.  Despite one party member arriving after the others who finished their food before the the other arrived, our friendly waitress Kaitlin told us to take our time even though the lunch crowd was large.  As always, the menu was extensive and all dishes contained fresh ingredients.  Quality, consistency and great service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill?start=20,3.24,2.93,2.93,,3.0540000000000003

24,Tina B.,"Needham Heights, MA",0,6,2.0,3.0,2017-06-21,"The night started off fine with a drink at the bar while waiting for an outside table. Also if our waitress  wasn't such a delight this would be one star review. We ordered a salad , and two ribeye steaks , our food did take a little longer than usual to arrive but we were enjoying our conversation so we didn't mind too much. A ""manager"" came over to apologize that they have run out of ribeye steak -seems odd to say that now it's been 45 mins and the kitchen is just making our food now? Hard to believe. No worries my friend wasn't upset she ordered the filet , rare. The manager or whoever she was comes back to tells us she wants to bring the other steak out and salad so food doesn't overcook, okay fine. Our waitress comes by and sees we're missing a ribeye and wasn't told of the kitchen mistake. Very disappointing that the lines of communication at this place are in total disarray. The real reason no ribeye, it went to the wrong table. How frustrating. And what's with the lie? Put on another ribeye. Maybe they did run out. Oh! During said chaos we gave our compliments to the male manager on duty about our waitress, she tells us he told her we said she was weird! Totally wasn't what we said! I think there's issues with staff and management at this place. Not sure we will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill?start=20,3.04,2.92,2.92,,2.9680000000000004

0,Bob L.,"Boston, MA",69,80,587.0,4.0,2017-08-08,If you've ever been to a cheesecake factory then you'll know precisely what to expect. Service was pleasant though not anything special (they were prompt in refilling our drinks which I always appreciate). The menu is huge (normal for cheesecake factory) and is also littered with ads which doesn't really bother me.   Overall if you like cheesecake after your meal this is the place to go since they have me huge selection! Ironically the only real complain is there listing of the calories in each dish since the meals can be ridiculously high in them (ignorance is bliss!).

The staff are extremely friendly and it's definitely worth checking out sometime especially if you live within walking distance of this place in one of the Chestnut Hill Apartment Complexes! So I'm not a cheesecake person myself but the Linda's Fudge Cake MY WORD IS SO DELICIOUS! You have to try this whether or not it's the first time you've been to this place!

38,Laurel C.,"Hartford, CT",0,4,,1.0,2017-09-03,"We've been here many times and had minimal problems with this place. But this time, when we came for Sunday brunch, we were completely taken aback by the rude and indecent service. The receptionist at the front (who we found out was named Emma) led us to a seat at the bar area, and not just the bar area. It was the darkest, most concealed part. Not to mention we had two kids and we found it very inappropriate that out of all the seats available at this time of day she led us to such an indecent seat. When we voiced our complaint to her and told her we wanted to sit at the terrace, she led us to, again, the very edge of the area and the darkest place possible. At that point we were fed up, and made a specific request to sit at a table at the center of the terrace, and the look she gave us was extremely rude. We asked to speak to a manager, and her explanation of what happened was completely ridiculous. She made an excuse of ""Here in Massachusetts it's alright for anyone to b seated at the bar."" We've been living here for over seven years and my father is an attorney and knew what's he said was complete bs. Then she tried to explain why we were placed at the very edge of the terrace. ""Every area is sectioned off to each server, so we wanted another server to be able to serve our costumers."" That one was also pretty ridiculous. Of all the times we've been here, nothing like this bad ever happened. We even considered leaving the restaurant altogether since we were so done with this place. But we decided to stay, and the plight continues. We asked for bread to start with, and it never came. Probably never coming back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill?start=20,3.04,2.92,2.92,,2.9680000000000004

I was supposedly transferred to the cashier each time but each time after waiting for 5 minutes there was no response.

Love the skinny menu options.  Plenty of options for kids. They also have outdoor sitting which is nice in warmer weather. The only complain about todays lunch - don't bring kids meals while they are extremely hot.
