299,Amy M.,"Grand Rapids, MI",99,453,407.0,3.0,2012-01-08,Holy busy Batman!  We wanted to eat dinner here but being a group of 10 on a Saturday night with a packed house and a line out the door.....I decided to just get some cheesecake to go. Can't go wrong there!! :) The tiramisu was splendid. Really terrific blend of tiramisu & cheesecake. The white chocolate macadamia was a little too sweet for me but still good.  Saved the Red Velvet for my Mom's Christmas Birthday...it was so good and my Mom really loved it. I was thrilled to have a special cake for my special Mom for sure!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=340,3.44,3.2,3.216,3.0200000000000005,3.2960000000000007
744,Tim J.,"Manteno, IL",16,210,72.0,1.0,2012-01-08,"We just got back from my wife's birthday dinner at the cheesecake factory in Chicago. We waited only moments to be seated on our reservation, but I watched 21 minutes tick by watching as tables all around us got seated with bread and water. When the table immediately to our right got their order taken and a moment later the table just beyond got their starter(both seated after us), I grabbed a waiter and asked to see a manager. We got an apology from a second manager and finally a waiter. After, starters arrived quickly. First the fried egg rolls with Guac, clearly fried in a hurry to get to us fast. Therefore very greasy and undercooked. After, the Thai lettuce wrap, which was the highlight of the evening. Although I imagine it is hard to screw up a raw appetizer plate. She had the orange chicken, a dish she had the previous day at the Cheesecake factory in Niles and said this portion was half of what it was in Niles. I had fettucini alfredo with chicken, which was incredibly dissapointing. It had about three oz chicken, the noodles were wide egg noodles and way way overcooked. They were just floppy. I ate about three oz of it and couldn't stand any more of it. Our seven year old had the chicken strips and refused to eat them, they were so over cooked. I tried them and she was right. They were as dry as cardboard....clearly pre-cooked. She ate none of them and only french fries. My wife stated the orange chicken was ok, but, ""not as good as Panda"". The cheesecake deserts were pretty good. My coffee was horrible and about on the level of dunkin donuts. Our bill came to $80.00 and we left a %12 tip. This was the worst money I have ever spent and I was highly disgusted with the food. I would not return to a cheesecake factory if cooporate contacted me and offered me a free equal meal. I plan to tell as many people I know what a terrible experience this was. Seriously, the orange chicken was not as good as panda?!? NEVER AGAIN",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=740,3.32,3.18,3.216,2.7560000000000002,3.2360000000000007
832,Jilly M.,"Chicago, IL",0,9,,5.0,2012-01-17,Interior is absolutely beautiful. Location is pretty superb at the bottom of the Hancock building so is a must when visiting Chicago. The wait can be long at the weekends but a good tip is to sit in the bar area where we were sat almost immediately. I recommend the Avocado egg rolls as an appetizer. Not being an avocado fan I loved them. Really delicious. The staff are all so nice and aim to please. Red Velvet cheesecake is also a must have but my favourite at the moment is the Oreo Cheesecake. It's so good. But having had appetizers and entrees they are happy to let you order dessert to take away. They even pack it up in a really presentable way with all the dressings etc. If your visiting Chicago you have to go to the Cheesecake Factory. It's such a great experience! Reservations are taken Mon to Fri during a set time only (there are some limitations re: party size and times) but the wait is so worth it if there at the weekend.

Cheesecake for dessert is good though. but food is like way way bad. why would anyone gives this place a good rating is beyond me. anyway last time I as there (other people pick it beforehand and I just kind of groan and bear it for the good of the party) there was a 'special' the Cuban sandwich. Oh it was special all-right!lol basically a French bun with yellow mustard and super pre-processed ham. omg so bad I wanted to cry lol! gawd it is all so bland and mediocre or worse.

666,Liz K.,"Chicago, IL",6,270,219.0,2.0,2012-03-01,"Going to the Cheesecake Factory on a Tuesday night, I thought, finally I'll be here once when it isn't over an hour wait to sit down and I'll be able to enjoy my meal because it won't be so crowded! Well, we didn't wait for an hour, and it wasn't crowded. But we did have a group of 15 and apparently that waves a giant red flag for them to lower the quality of service. For a restaurant that consistently deals with a packed house on weekends, I was disillusioned to see that they couldn't keep up with our table on a practically empty Tuesday night. And it's not that our expectations were unreasonable, either; the things that I expected (greeting within 5 minutes, water glasses for everyone, drinks within 10-15 minutes, food to get to the right people) were completely within reason, in my opinion!  In terms of food, I was just underwhelmed with my dish. I got the Stuffed Chicken Tortilla, which comes with black beans, corn cakes, and sour cream. To me, that sounds like a Mexican/Hispanic dish, and I was looking forward to having some strong flavors come at me...but it was impressively bland. Not even more than a few shakes of salt could bring out an ounce of flavor. Really disappointing. I will give them one positive note, however, and it's that the cheesecake was wonderfully light yet rich. I got the Dulce de Leche variety and it was just fab. While I won't be back here to dine in, I would have no problem with dropping by to pick up a slice or two to enjoy at home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=580,3.08,3.1,3.2,2.9840000000000004,3.0920000000000005
719,Melissa P.,"Chicago, IL",8,132,69.0,4.0,2012-03-18,"I love going to the Cheesecake Factory.  They have the best cheesecake I've ever had anywhere.  I've tried to make cheesecake like theirs at home and just can't do it.  I've tried so many times and made so many recipes and they will never be as good as this place.  The only reason I give them 4 stars is because sometimes the wait for a table or even to get just cheesecake is bad.  They really need more help sometimes or maybe just to hurry up a bit.  I've had their salmon a couple times too and that is also delicious and their mashed potatoes are to die for, but I primarily stop by there for cheesecakes.  I really shouldn't eat that stuff because I need to lose weight, but I can't help myself and keep on going back.  That is how good they are that even a diet can't keep me away.  So go on and try them out if it's not too busy around there.  Probably the best time to go is during the week in the evenings.  On the weekends they are too packed with tourists a lot.  Not that I blame them for wanting some of that creamy goodness of cheesecake.  So yeah I say go try it out if you like cheesecake or are shopping at the Water Tower mall and get hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=720,3.12,3.1,3.2,3.248,3.1080000000000005

I then asked our waitress to swap our's out as well since I was pretty sure the same busboy had set our table as well. The manager came over and apologized, which was nice, and he assured me he'd speak with the busboy. Aside from that stomach turning experience, the service was friendly and swift and the food was good.  The bathroom was dirty too....maybe I witnessed a pattern with this particular location?  With this catering to a large tourist base, I suggest they need to work harder on clean up and upkeep.

I came here with a party of 4 on a crowded Friday lunch hour. I was pleased that I only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table because when I saw the brouhaha inside I was assuming at least a 30 - 40 minute wait. Once seated, we ordered a few drinks, strawberry and raspberry martinis, both incredibly tasty. As a guy, by social pressure and choice, I don't usually order martinis but I was on vacation, so I gave in and was not disappointed. They make 'em pretty strong so be prepared for a nice long meal. At lunch, be sure to look at the specials in addition to the normal offerings. The menu is so expansive that it took me several minutes just to order a drink. Once our food arrived, I heard only compliments about each dish: ""This pasta is glorious!"", ""I thought you could only get jambalaya likes this in Louisiana!"", ""It's like every food I like is partying on this sandwich!"". Stuff to that effect. And of course, we had to order at least one slice of cheesecake, chocolate mousse.

560,Lucian I.,"Dearborn, MI",0,4,,2.0,2012-05-28,"Don't believe the hype. We went there on a visit to Chicago, because everybody told us we had to go there. The restaurant is a tourist spot, crowded, but we didn't have to wait long, about 10 mins. I hated the decor, they go for whimsy, it comes out tacky. The waiters are dressed in all white, and it makes them look like orderlies from a mental institution. The food was very unimpressive. The menu is huge, and you need a few minutes to get through it, especially if it's your first time there like it was for us. We had a BLT salad as an appetizer, which was good, and ordered 2 entrees from the seafood menu. The portions are huge (even the soft drinks came in a huge glass, probably somewhere around 30oz), and the food was ok, but nothing to make me go back there. I doubt that I will ever eat again in a Cheesecake Factory. It is overhyped and overpriced, especially since what they serve seems to be just glorified fast food. The cheesecake was good, but very, very expensive, at about $7-9 a slice. It didn't blow me away like I would expect for that price. You can find better, cheaper desserts at local Chicago restaurants. We ended up spending about $80 including tip and dessert, for something that was probably worth about half of that amount. In my opinion, you'd be better spending your money in a local restaurant, trying some of the local fare: there are lots of gems spread all around the city, where you can have a more pleasurable and satisfying experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=620,2.84,3.13,3.208,3.0480000000000005,3.014

Their menu is abnormally large, which can be great, but if you don't necessarily know what you want, it can take a while to make a selection.

The tomato, basil, and cheese pizza was soggy (like fall off the crust soggy) and the Cajun Chicken ""Littles"" were dry, and trying to eat them was like attempting pound down charred bark mixed with broken glass, and the included mashed potatoes were the consistency of kindergarden crafting paste.   So, the one good thing that is constantly good about this Cheesecake Factory is the service.  The waitstaff is typically always upbeat, regardless of how busy the place is.   So, given the opportunity, skip it.  The foods expensive for what you get, regardless of portion size.  Plus, there are far better eateries within a block of this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=460,3.32,3.19,3.216,2.8240000000000003,3.242

First, NEVER come here on a weekend.  Just don't do it.  I know you don't want to sit next to a sweaty dude from Kenosha wearing jorts and a fanny pack any more than I do.  And if you come to CF on a weeknight, you just may avoid the influx of crazy tourists.  I mean, you'll still probably see some Kentucky-fried bangs and Reeboks, but probably less on a Wednesday evening than a Saturday, right?  You'll also avoid a fairly hefty wait.  Seating tends to come more quickly on the weeknights. Second, order the raspberry martini.  Just do it and don't worry about the stigma of drinking a pink drink.  My dad is the manliest man ever and he tucked into that pink cocktail like it was his job.  They're good.  Lethally good. Third, eat the Navajo sandwich.  Calorie-bomb?  YES.  Flavor-bomb?  YESSSSSS.  Grilled chicken, shredded lettuce, lush tomatoes, red onion and a bit of mayo on fry bread is just heaven.  You can do a double spin class tomorrow, ok? Finally, just get a piece of cheesecake.  If you ask your server nicely, they'll even cut it in half for you and serve it on separate plates.  That means double whipped cream, ya'll!  I'm partial to the fresh strawberry. Sometimes you have to eat downtown.  Cheesecake Factory can certainly be a more than acceptable place to make it happen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=380,3.56,3.23,3.208,3.152,3.362

After writing the review and sending it to Cheesecake, I received a phone call from Nick (their manager apparently who doesn't seem to be in office that often), who informed me of his sadness to hear my bad experience. He gave me his number and told me to call back to discuss the matter. Upon receiving the message, I proceeded to call Nick back to be greeted by one of the staff, who told me that she does not know of anyone by that name that works at the Cheesecake. I listened to the message again and tried the other number instead of the caller ID number, which went to Bryan (a staff member). This time Bryan placed me on hold for 10 minutes after he said he will try to find Nick for me. I was then disconnected. I gave them a benefit of a doubt and called back. Bryan responded by saying Nick was not there.... The PLOT THICKENS! I called back next day and got a girl (Jessica), who said that Nick was not in again. Surprisingly, a manager seems to not do much at the factory. As I type this update, I am on hold for 20 minutes already on the following day after Bryan answered and told me to wait while he tries to see if Nick is in.

The floor was slippery from my table all the way to bathroom... the Blackhawks could have held a practice session on this floor. The restaurant was jam packed and obviously understaffed because the service was terrible.  The food was horribly timed as well.  Our table had ordered 3 fish tacos with 1 grilled and 2 tempura.  How could they serve 1 tempura while the other 2 didn't come out for a good 20 minutes?  At the very least, the 2 tempuras should be served at the same time.  That was the story for everybody else's dinners; nothing came out at the same time.  The tempura taco itself was completely overstuffed and the first taco itself was soggy (and an absolute mess to eat) as a result.  The last taco you eat will be the soggiest since it's been bathing in its own juices the entire time.  Simple requests like salad dressing on the side were completely ignored, as were requests for lime wedges that weren't bone dry. As for dessert?  Somehow they still managed to mess that up by serving the strawberry shortcake long after the rest of us received and finished eating our cheesecakes. Our waiter apologized for the service and said that the weekend before school starts in September is when they get slammed the hardest.  This is still no excuse for the restaurant if it were properly run.  Save your money and skip this location; it was a complete disgrace.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=700,3.52,3.25,3.22,2.468,3.358

I feel like I have grown up beyond the Cheesecake factory.  I am so tired of the menu.  It is so big that it takes about 20 minutes to look through it before you can finally decide what to order and then the waiter comes over, after 20 minutes to tell you the specials. Honestly!  Just print them up and insert them in the front of this massive book they call a menu.  I believe less is more and the menu here wants to make everyone happy and in the end it makes no one happy!  And the evidence is in the lossy food they push out of the kitchen. On my most recent visit I asked the hostess to have a booth because this was going to be a working lunch and we needed some room to layout our documents and make notes.  She took me to a table that had benches...I asked her if she considered it a booth and she said yes.  I then informed her that my colleague was not going to be happy but she insisted it was a booth.  So we sat down and literally our chest were at the table height.  There was no way we could even write or take notes. I hate to say I told you so but I am going to say, ""I TOLD YOU SO!"" So we got up and asked her again if we could have a booth.  It was already after 1pm and we had missed the lunch crowd, so there were plenty of booths in the back.  She then took us to a booth that had been half cleaned but not on my side.  I grabbed a clean napkin from another table and picked up the dirty tray and moved it to the next table. I then used the napkin to wipe up the mess.  It was awkward with me just standing in the aisle and I was not about to sit on top of a mess. The bus boy arrived and started to clean our whole table again.  He then grabbed his dirty gross full of wet food tray. Next he took silverware from the table that the dirty gross full of wet food tray was sitting on top of and placed it all in front of me.  Honestly I was so grossed out.  Someone call the health department!  How oblivious could this guy be?  This is just bad management and a corporation that does not care about keeping things clean for their customers.  I got up again and went to a different table to get myself some fresh silverware, a new plate and a clean napkin.   We ordered our food and made a few simple requests.  For example, I ordered my turkey sandwich to have mayo on the side.  Guess what?  I got mayo on the side and also got mayo on the sandwich.  Really?  Again the kitchen did not care enough to read the notes of the waiter.  I did not send it back because we were having a business meeting and I just needed to keep working and eating at the same time.  I also got my salad dressing on the side too and it never came to the table.  I had to remind the food runner about it and eventually the waiter brought it. My buddy got the fish tacos and when I asked him how they were he made a face that told me they were not really good.  I am so glad we did not share them because I would have been mad.  He then said, ""I do not even like this place it is just so close to the office!""  Not to self...find a new restaurant to have our lunch meetings in! So yes this place is a tourist trap.  It is one of those chains that all of the hungry shoppers on Michigan Avenue from out of town end up in because it is familiar to them.  Now do not get me wrong there cheesecake is good and maybe cheesecake on this visit would have made me feel better or even 4 star-ish but cheesecake and business lunches do not go together. The food here is not that great.  In all of the years I have still not found anything on this menu that just jumps out and says, ""Order me all of the time!""  In fact, I just give up!  This place is a cheesecake place that happens to serve bad food too.  And when I say bad food...I mean food that is not even special or good.  I was also not happy with the service.  A hostess who could not actually give us a booth even though there were a bunch available.  A busboy who really did not care if his dirty disgusting tray was touching clean silverware and plates.  Someone could get sick because of this.  Food that had special requests made but none of the special requests were even carried out correctly.   This place just keeps packing people in and does not care to make it the best experience ever!  And that is sad with all of the amazing restaurants in downtown Chicago.  I wish you would clean up your act cheesecake factory and have a little respect for the product you are serving the public.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=200,3.32,3.28,3.236,2.6280000000000006,3.2960000000000003

However, the selection of ice creams was a bit disappointed, but once ordered the Godiva chocolate brownie sunday ice cream thingy, it made up for it in size. It could've fed two tables actually. At the end we ordered two cheesecakes, the low carb and the banana one, and they really were the highlight of our breakfast table next morning. All in all, our waitress was friendly and casual, the food is decent, the selection extensive, but nothing special. The waiting and the place being so packed, was not great though, to say the least. Just order some cheesecake here and take it home to enjoy with a good movie. P.s. Don't take your date here! Although the lights are dim, there're more romantic and private places. At least the girl at the next table did not look too impressed.

484,Courtney W.,"Brandon, FL",1216,580,84.0,3.0,2012-12-03,"This place is like tourist central in Chicago. It's below the Hancock and people just can't help themselves. Personally, when I travel to a city I try to eat some of the food that has made it famous or is unique to that location so I don't quite understand the rush to this place but who am I to judge. I've been here and I've waited almost an hour to be seated since they don't take reservations. Unlike other locations, you can stray too far from the bar area or your pager won't go off. It kind of feels like a cave in here since you are pretty much in the ground and the base of the Hancock. They have everything that all of the other CFs have and I normally go with quesadillas or the bow tie pasta chicken dish. It's easy to split something here or order an entree for yourself and be prepared to have lunch for at least a day or two on leftovers alone. The menu here is ridiculous. If you can't find something on it, you need to never eat out again because you will never be happy anywhere. The cheesecake is slightly overpriced but they come in way too many flavors to count.

The White Chocolate Rasberry Truffle cheesecake, for example, is as good as it sounds!  The problem is when you venture for anything beyond cheesecake that you should prepare for disappointment.

322,Dion T.,"Ypsilanti, MI",1,50,,2.0,2012-12-29,"Good: - Red Velvet Cheesecake; it's excellent. - Godiva Cheesecake; it's INCREDIBLE. - Macaroni Balls; delicious by themselves but even better with the accompanying sauce. - Stuffed Chicken Tortilla; initially thought I'd need some heat/spice, but all the pieces work very, very well, this was really tasty. Not so good: - Strawberry Lemonade; you're pretty much just drinking a glass of sugar. Just a hint of lemonade for me. - The wait, part 1; they told us an hour, gave us a buzzer that went off in an hour, we turned it in and were told to wait in a line for our name to be called, which was an additional 30 minutes.... - The wait, part 2; .....because they lost track of people's names, including ours. - The wait, part 3; A manager put in an appetizer to appease us....but didn't tell our waiter. The appetizer was delivered to the wrong table while the waiter was heading to the kitchen to check on it. Since we were already waiting, we added a second appetizer to the mix. A waiter-helper brought the original appetizer (!!!) plus an appetizer...that...we...didn't...order. True story. - The bill; We were told by our waiter the the manager wouldn't take anything off. We told him we need to talk to him/her. We explained our experience to the manager that came, and the bill was cut in half. Then the waiter said that THIS manager was the one he was hoping to get initially, not the one that first denied our claim. So there's a rogue manager roaming the premises and pleasing the customers...ok. - For the love of God, I would love to actually see the person sitting next to me. Mood lighting is one thing, nap lighting is another. Irritatingly dark in parts of the restaurant. Final thought: The food is, and has always been, excellent for us. The experience has always been frustrating. Our next visit(s) will be for cheesecake only, to-go. 5 stars for food, minus 3 for the experience. If you're a patient person, you can endure, it's not a life damaging experience.

This was the worst dining experience I have had in a long time.  We went mid-afternoon to the Chicago cheesecake factory.  It was 4 friends and myself; the service was awful.  The male server serving us (I cant remember his name he had blonde longer cut hair, his name started with an F and it was a foreign name) was completely rude the entire meal and didn't even give us the time of day.  From the drinks to the bill I was disappointed.  We are in our mid to late 20s and locals.... We were out shopping for the day and ready to get some drinks and yummy food.... He sold us one drink each and when we drank them right away he came around took our dirty glasses, said nothing and walked away.  You would think a server would ask if we would like another drink.... Not only is that GOOD service but it would increase your bill as well??  He answered all of our questions rude and some questions couldn't even answer and said things like ""I don't know"".  Being a Chicago restaurant manager myself it took a lot to ignore this situation...  I tried hard.   However when our food all came out at different times, items were cold, the server was MIA for the entire time and the server never cleared anything besides the ONE drink order I was fed up.  I get very upset when I have a bad meal and even more upset when my friends are not enjoying their meal especially when we are PAYING CUSTOMERS!   I then decided I wanted to talk to a manager...  The manager was rude too!!  He said sorry however did nothing.  I told him ""If this was the restaurant I worked for this server would no longer have a job... I am not trying to get anyone fired but it's clear he has no respect for his job!""  The manager replied ""What can I do for you"" my reply was ""Nothing!"" and walked away.  The experience was already by far ruined!  And what type of management team member says ""what can i do for you?""  Your a manager sir and your job is to make sure your staff is doing a great job and giving customers the correct experience; if this fails then it is your job to embrace the customer, take in any problems and help assure the customer this was  fluke and would never happen again.  It is your job to make sure that the customer leaves happy and understands that the performance was unacceptable and engage in correcting rather than asking what the customer needs....  You know what we needed.  And you failed to do so.  There for you have now ruined a dining experience for your customers - one that actually could have been saved at that very moment.  Every place has bad staff members and its moments like this where a manager has the opportunity to a) correct and coach said employee of b) replace said employees with a staff member that wants their job and enjoys the service industry.   At the end of the day the food was sub-par since it was cold coming out at all different times, the server was the most awful - not only server but human I have ever interacted with and the manager should reconsider his life path.... Maybe consider a field where he actually isn't in charge of individuals and sits behind a desk and doesn't have to deal with customers.   I will add the only good experience was the bartender while we were waiting for our table.  It took him a long time to come over to us however once he did he was very pleasant and engaging....  Maybe they should consider moving him to management position or hiring more employees like that rather than Francisco or whatever his name was!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=580,3.08,3.22,3.236,2.7880000000000003,3.1640000000000006

When we checked in the hostess said their would be a 30 minute wait, so we tried the bar area and found a table top right away.  Service - Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. While we waited for food, a manager came over to apologize for the wait and I'm pretty sure was about to offer us a free appetizer, but we declined and just asked for more bread. What's funny about this is we didn't think at all the food was delayed. About 1/2 minutes later our food came out piping hot.  Food - The last few times I came here I order a delicious salmon dish (so good I figured out how to make it at home), bi this day I opted for the chicken enchiladas. Good Choice. It was a different taste than I was expecting from other times I've had enchiladas, but it was a good different. Very earthy and savory flavor. I finished every morsel. We also order cheesecake to go - and of course that was wonderful as well. Atmosphere - Set up like most Cheescake factories. A little dark here though, but once your eyes adjust, it's okay. It was a bit noisy in the bar area, so steer clear of there is you want quiet time.  So...the bathroom. Pretty clean, but it has complete stalls (toilet and sink) all together behind a door you can lock. So I and others had to wait a long time for a stall.

The food is pretty consistently fresh and of good quality, and there is enough variety for everyone to find something that they like. When I've gone alone, with a date, or friends, it has been 90% satisfactory, as well. (I miss you, Avery!) With all of that being said, I went again tonight. I told myself that it was for the Pre-National Cheesecake Day deal (1/2 off dessert slices), but I digress. I am taking the time to be the bazillionth reviewer of The Cheesecake Factory because of water! Yes, you read me correctly. Water is the the reason for this review. I just couldn't take it anymore! The food, the ambience, and the service are all laudable, but the water SUCKS DIRT! I don't understand how a fine dining establishment such as TCF can serve its guests such AWFUL water! I had to squeeze almost an entire lime into my glass in order to make it palatable! About 3 visits prior, I went with a very outspoken friend, who, upon being asked by our server if he needed anything else, said,""Yes. Get rid of this nasty a** water, and bring me some GOOD water! I was a mortified, but the server returned shortly with a glass of perfectly delicious, and, apparently, purified water! He mentioned that he'd gotten it from another part of the restaurant. Hunh?!? You KNOW what I asked for on my next visit, right? Unfortunately, this server must not have known about the secret source, because he brought me a bottle of Fiji and a glass, and tacked on a hefty $5 for the pleasure. It's needless to say that I didn't try that one again, as I don't particularly care to pay so dearly for a glass of water worth drinking. My dearest Cheesecake Factory, can you PLEASE remedy this one major flaw?

The staff is really always up on their A-Game. My Thai lettuce wraps were amazing, and huge! It's been probably 8 or 9 months since I've had them and they were delicious! I strongly recommend these! However, I honestly have never had anything on the menu I don't like. I was close to getting a new chipolte pasta, but I thought my body would be happier with the lettuce wraps.

I should've just kept walking! To preface, I am NOT a picky eater nor do I like to complain at all. Went in, sat near the bar, he ordered a Fat Tire (bottled) and I ordered a Goose Island Draft (the 32 oz). Since we were sitting near the bar, I sat and watched the bartender pour my draft which just foamed up. All foam. Top to bottom. Guy just left it there. Server came by and said they had to switch the tap so I said, ""Sure, as long as I can get a new beer and not the one sitting there."" He agreed and eventually I got my beer. But, the issue was, the bartender decided to just ADD to my foam that had been sitting there as foam slowly turning into beer for 15 minutes. The beer was rather warm and nasty. Server came back, I asked for a new beer, and received new beer somewhat correct (the bottled beer was WAY colder than the draft beer). By then it was after my apps came out that I finally received my beer. It was 20 minutes to receive a beer. It was also very weird that when I went to tell my server about the beer all I had to do was say ""excuse me"" and he goes, ""Is your beer warm?"" like he already knew.... For dinner, I ordered the Chicken Tacos. They brought out shrimp then came back with the correct ones after saying that I ordered chicken. Bit into the tacos and started to wonder why they tasted funny. Turns out the taco shells were stale! Told the server, and the poor guy just can see it and feel it.... the look on his face. Thankfully he comped the tacos because by then, I really did not want to eat there. The people were nice but it is rather clear there is something wrong with their managers (a bartender who can't pour beer and a kitchen that can't keep taco shells fresh).  I say go anywhere -except- there. TL;DR: Ordered beer, got warm foam-beer. Ordered tacos, got stale shells.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=460,3.52,3.26,3.244,2.8200000000000003,3.3640000000000003

We were stuffed!  Everything was really delicious, the gravy on my mashed potatoes had mushrooms in it so I think it was the madeira mushroom sauce that normally comes with the Steak Diane (which I would have ordered - maybe next time).  My only beef (pun intended) is that there was gristle on my tenderloin, which I just can't forgive for a 29.95 price tag.  And what was supposed to be medium rare was medium, boo.  But it's a chain, and I refused to bitch about anything.  I was just happy to be eating because I saved up all day and was very hungry.  So that's where that point went.

We grabbed lunch around 12 o'clock so we waited a tad few. No biggie. Mind you I could see that the restaurant wasn't at full capacity, but I digress. Our server seemed very heavy footed and I could feel him reading me like a book. As if he somehow knew these two Mexicans weren't going to tip him the appropriate amount compared to his more sophisticated white tables. Turns out he was just a flat out horrid server. He did these super long pauses between dropping off drinks, bread, appetizers and taking our lunch order. Last time I was here the waitress was so helpful. She told us about the soup of the day the specials and even recommended her favorite dishes. So friendly and attentive. Total opposite from my most current experience.  He didn't tell us anything but the soup of the day. He said the sod was clam chowder and that it was the only soup available in a very harsh monotone. As if saying we better not even think about wanting something different or else. Yikes. We started off with stuffed mushrooms and the crab bites. This day the mushrooms had a funny taste, sort of like old mushrooms. They didn't taste fresh which it why I usually order them. The crab bites are always delightful. Very crispy on the outside but moist on the inside.  When dinning at The Cheesecake Factory I usually get the pasta carbonara. The sauce in the pasta is very delicious. Very very calorie filled but very delicious in deed. Peas and bacon, How can you go wrong?  I decided to try something new. The Shepard pot pie screamed my name. Mushrooms, carrots, squash, ground beef, mash potatoes , yum! The dish was very savory. I really wish it had some sort of pastry crust. That would of definitely brought the dish together.  I forgot what my bf had. He liked it. Something Cajun maybe I can't remember. Ha.  To quickly sum my experience up I had a nice lunch for the exception of our server. I only saw him hovering over us when he wanted us to pay the bill. Made me not want to return to that location in particular. But who am I kidding. I just won't sit in his section. If only I remember our waitress name :((  Ps. The cheesecakes are out of this world.

290,Ndidi B.,"Chicago, IL",1,19,5.0,4.0,2013-12-27,"Last night was my first time ever dining at The Cheesecake Factory. I had read a few Yelp reviews prior to and the mixed feedback had me skeptical. But my boyfriend had received a CF giftcard from his job, so we decided to have a date night here. I knew the restaurant would be packed because several Yelpers coined this place as a ""tourist trap"", so I decided to call ahead to get an estimate of the wait time. The lady said it was a half hour wait and kindly informed me that I could not put my name on the list over the phone when I tried to. My boyfriend ended up arriving before me, so our table was ready by the time I got there. I asked him how long he had been there and he said it had only been a 15 minute wait.  We were escorted to our table and given menus. I have seen some pretty large 'multi-paged' menus in my lifetime, but never had I seen a menu with ads! I chuckled to myself as it became clear why this place was labeled a tourist trap. As we were perusing, a female server named Liz came over and introduced herself. She asked if she could start us off with drinks and I asked her for two ice waters and two cups of hot water. [The hot water was for the silverware, which several Yelpers had pointed out would be filthy and to my suprise, were correct.] A few minutes after she left, a male server named Ryan came over and introduced himself. He then proceeded to ask if he could get us any drinks. Suprised, I told him we had been greeted already. He then explained that the previous server had been confused about whether or not we were her table, and apologized for the confusion. After recieving our drinks, being served warm bread and Ryan patiently answering all of my boyfriend's redundant questions about salads, we ordered our entrees. I ordered the Chicken Bellagio while my boyfriend ended up going with the Ceasar. Our food arrived in a timely manner, long enough for me to discover that each bathroom stall has its own personal sink and us to eat all of our bread, and looked absolutely delicious. Once we began to dig in, we both were pleasantly suprised. His Ceasar was generously portioned and well-dressed, while my pasta had my tastebuds rejoicing. I begged him to taste my dish and he, being born in Italy and a Italian food connoisseur, was also impressed. The overall evening was better than I expected, and my complaints were few and far apart. Sadly, it was my night to pick up the bill and last night's budget did not allow for me to try an cheesecake. Lol. In conclusion, I realize that The Cheesecake Factory is not a five-star restaurant, as should anyone else considering eating here. The food was tasty and that is all that matters. P.S. I took off a star because of the silverware. I'm a slight germaphobe, and icky silverware makes me feel uncomfortable. The managers of this restaurant really need to pay more attention to this issue, because I'm sure that is some sort of health code violation! :c",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=340,3.44,3.4,3.268,3.024,3.4160000000000004

Nick started with us, very informative, great smile, pleasant attitude, and was very composed in the middle of a huge dinner rush. He definitely possesses a very valuable professional work ethic where I can see him in management. He also informed us later that Tinos would take over, where as before he had his hands full. That shows great communication amongst the co workers and I applaud that! Tinos also was wonderful, very warm welcoming attitude, great smile. Even the bussers wished us to enjoy our meals which was refreshing.  The food was fantastic, two thumbs up. I had the Sun-dried tomato pasta with a red and white sauce mix (with chicken). Perfect combination of sweet and savory. My husband had the jambalaya pasta which he loved. He said ""This is the first time I am eating from someone else's opinion and it was very good! He was on point with this!"" I don't have to say much about the cheesecake, we all know it's good! Only thing negative is I do not recommend sitting by the window, there was a strong cold draft I had to wear my winter coat and scarf the entire time with my husbands jacket on my legs.

Celebrating my 50th birthday and wondering where to celebrate, I was lucky I spotted this location, which also happened to be close to the hotel we were staying at.  The first thing that really struck me was that we were able to get a table right away and this being a Friday night!  The waitress seemed to either be new or totally overwhelmed because she kept forgetting things and had to keep calling her back over and over. Food was typical Chessecake Factory fare, so no real surprises here.  While having dinner, an employee carrying a container with ice dropped it close to our table making a whole mess... When it came time for dessert, my wife asked for a slice of cheesecake and she expected to have it with a birthday candle like the so many other times in other locations but to her surprise, they were out of candles.

145,Giselle V.,"Irvine, CA",213,282,1596.0,1.0,2014-03-23,"This is a chain restaurant so the food tastes the same as it does at every other Cheesecake Factory. However, the service leaves A LOT to be desired.  When we sat down our waiter said that he would be back to take our drink order and when he came back he brought waters for all four of us with him. (The waters aren't significant now but they will be). After he took our drink order (two iced teas, one diet coke, one strawberry lemonade) and appetizer order, he came back with the two teas and said that he had completely forgotten the diet coke and needed to pick up the lemonade from the bar and that he had put in our order for the appetizer.  We didn't see him for another 10 minutes, that is, he didn't come to our table to check on us. He served the table across from us the lemonade we had ordered, that they had ordered after us and he stood at the computer most of the time shaking his head and punching buttons.  Our appetizer came out before the other half of our drink order came. When we were done with our appetizer he brought the other two drinks that had been ordered. We waited another 50 minutes for our food to come. During this time our waiter visited the aforementioned computer several times and continued to punch more buttons, shake his head in frustration and talk to himself.  The one time he did come to see how we were, he brought a water pitcher to refill the waters that we had to drink because our regular drink orders were empty, but he didn't refill any of the drinks we actually wanted. It took another 20 minutes after we finished our food, and had requested boxes, for us to receive said boxes and the check.  The only way this restaurant would be worth visiting is if someone came at a time that was not the busy dinner rush.  We sat next to the kitchen and saw how small it was and that the kitchen staff was trying their hardest to pump out orders while the wait staff stood around joking with each other, dropping plates and cups (6 dropped plates/cups occurred while we were seated, God knows how many there are every other day) and scavenging off of plates of food that had been returned.  As a patron I honestly do not appreciate seeing my waiter, and the rest of the wait staff, eat off of the same plate, using their bare hands and proceeding with their duties without washing their hands at any time during the whole process.  Also, the kitchen was rather small and I am not sure if it was responsible for serving both stories of the restaurant, which would not be wise on behalf of the restaurant chain itself, which could have accounted for it taking so long with our food to arrive.

This is not a place we would usually get lunch or dinner at. What a horrible mistake! The worst burger experience of my life. Also the decor is hideous!  We came in around 1:45pm and had to wait almost 45 minutes to be seated.  After being seated we placed our order.  We had a lot of time to look over the menu when we were waiting 10 years for a table. We both ordered the Factory burger - I requested my burger well done with double tomato and no onions.  My boyfriend requested his burger medium rare and with only cheese. About 30 minutes later our server comes back with our food and plops it down and runs off.   Just by looking at my burger I could tell it was the wrong order.  Instead of the Factory burger I received the Smokehouse BBQ Burger (WTF I HATE BBQ SAUCE! HATE IT! The smell makes me sick)  My boyfriend's burger was fine and started to eat.   I tried to flag down a waiter or a staff member and there were none to be seen.  Finally 15 minutes later I was able to grab a bus boy and get him to grab our server.  After waiting another 10 minutes our server finally shows back up and I explain to him that I have the wrong burger and he admits he wrote the wrong thing down on our ticket. Wtf?  How do you mix up a factory burger and a BBQ burger?  He offered to bring me another burger and I refused because I wasn't going to wait another 30 minutes to get a burger when my boyfriend had been done eating for 20 minutes!   The server barely apologized.  I asked for the burger to be taken off our bill as I couldn't eat it.  He said he couldn't do that but could give me a piece of cheesecake for free.  Ummm wtf?  Are you serious?  You messed up my order, delivered a burger I couldn't eat but you are still going to charge me full price for it?  Hello! I'm starving!!!!!!!! The server brought us a tiny piece of cheesecake after we paid.   Thank god we didn't have to pay anything out of pocket for the crap the Cheesecake Factory serves.

This was my first time coming to any Cheesecake Factory in the US. My wife and I wanted to have a great experience all around but that dream came to a halt.    It came to a halt in several ways. The first was when the manager mispronounced my name when calling our reservation.    The next was when the manager sat us next to an area where cold air was being brought in through the back doors. I told the manager we couldn't sit there but while he was listening to me, he had his hand on my shoulder. It was kind of like a in the animal kingdom asserting-my-dominance power play. It was really passive-aggressive and so I did the only logical thing and proceeded to put my hand on his shoulder. He told us that he would get us another table but that we had to go back and wait for him. Bad move on his part.    As if, the manager wasn't enough we were greeted by our waiter. I abruptly told him that my wife and I needed to move and we were waiting for the manager to come pick us up.   Now, I'm a kind man. When I do a job in the service industry, I come from a place of peace. This waiter told us to leave because he had to make tips. It was in the most condescending way possible.  He made us feel like dollar signs.  Even if we were dollar signs to him at least give us the illusion that we are not and actually provide good service.    He then later apologized but it was too little, too late.    Good food yet such lousy service. I really hope the district manager trains the individuals mentioned in the review.  No mercy for those who don't know that good service is key to a businesses' success.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=400,3.36,3.37,3.3,2.2800000000000002,3.366

We went for an early dinner Saturday evening & literally had the worst service I've ever had. I'll break it down - Drinks - 1st round took forever. Ordered 2nd round & they never came.  Bread - Were asked if we wanted some & which kind. We said yes & one of each. It never came. We requested it again when our food arrived & they only brought 1 kind. When we asked for more, we were told they were out but would bring us some when a new batch was finished. It never came. Entrees - the Pasta di Vinci was tasteless & my steak medallions were served with a butter knife. Nice. We left without getting our 2nd round of drinks & noticed that the people next to us left before their cheesecake arrived. They abandoned cheesecake - that is how bad the service was.

I usually do not have complaints with the cheesecake factory but this occasion was the exception. We ordered to corn tamales as usually because they are so good it has to be a sin. I regret not ordering the red velvet cheesecake because I I did nto like my past at all. The sauce was water and thin and did not coat the past so I felt like I was eating dry season pasta. I would never order that meal again. We asked for extra sauce but that dish is just not a winner. We sat in these booths in the back and my friends seat was wobbly if that makes any sense. So anytime the person in the booth behind her would move or get up she would feel it. Our waiter was ridiculously slow and we had to remind him about everything (even utensils).

We were seated in a booth, and I instantly noticed that our lamp was amazingly dusty. Like, I was scared if someone ran past our table, dust would fall into our food. I ordered a red sangria, because I love sangria and I want to try it everywhere. Their sangria was OVERLY sweet. I know it's the cheesecake factory, but there's no reason my sangria should taste like a cherry jolly rancher. My friend got the chicken caesar salad.

531,Joe B.,"Chicago, IL",0,24,,1.0,2014-06-25,"My late wife and I had eaten at Cheesecake hundreds of times after Cheesecake opened in the Hancock. We worked late night. So it was a great place to dine on quality food. When our daughter was born, we stopped going, and later, we went to more neighborhood restaurants. But last night, because we were out after 10,  I decided to bring my ten year old daughter to a place where her late beloved Mommy and I shared so many wonderful meals and times. As we left, my daughter asked me if Mommy and I had considered a divorce. Wow! Has this place gotten awful. The place had all kinds of open tables in rooms where people were seated. Yet we were told it would be a five to ten minute wait, which turned into fifteen minutes. The wait was the best part of the meal. It is clear that the staff culture has fallen off the cliff as witnessed by a group of staff members exchanging inappropriate chit chat/salacious gossip by the coffee bar despite the fact that we were within seven feet  ear shot.  Then there was the food and service. When we sat down, my daughter immediately spotted a dirty bread plate, for which I pointed it out to the server. It took five minutes, but eventually he replaced it. Never got regular water despite my request for it. (Hey. I am not interested in refilling my much smaller than it used to be Virgin Pina Colada.). Waiter took our order separately. Why I don't know. And then there was the food. My Tuna Ahi was the worst meal I have had in over ten years. It was the worst piece of tuna I have ever encountered in my life. I am truly ashamed of myself for having eaten it---such shame I have not felt since 30 years ago when I picked up a sweat hog at 2:00 am at Katzenjammers a long since closed Lincoln Park bar and spent the night with her. (And yes. That was the last time in my life when I ever got drunk.) And then came the fin de sicle--the cheesecakes. Not that bad. They seem to be a little lighter than they were, but they were OK. But the waiter (""Houdini"") should have sensed that all was not well when I ordered my check to come with the cheesecakes. Plain and simple.

300,Adela V.,"Miami, FL",42,5,,1.0,2014-07-22,"HORRIBLE.  I've been to various locations across the country and always loved the food, service, and overall atmosphere. I always go to a CF for my birthday since cheesecake is THE best dessert and their selection is amazing. Yesterday was my birthday and I was craving some orange chicken (which is what I always tend to order) and birthday cheesecake. So, my husband and I headed over for some birthday fun (or so I thought).  The location is great which is also why I wanted to go, the view and the breeze while sitting outside are amazing! It was a Monday night and was surprisingly busy (tourists maybe?), so we waited about 30 minutes for a table outside, which was fine, I don't mind waiting so long as the experience is a good one. Once we sat down, a waiter did not come by to take our order for about 15min. We already knew what we wanted to order since we had decided during our 30min wait. When the waiter came by, FINALLY, we ordered our food (spinach and cheese dip as an appetizer, orange chicken for me and pasta carbonara for my husband). Our waiter asked if we wanted some bread, we of course said YES! The bread took about another 15min to arrive, and by then our appetizer arrived too. Ok, so far so good. Then, about 20min later, our food arrived. We were about ready to eat a whale at that point, we were super hungry! That's when the disappointment comes. The food was bland. The white rice that came with my orange chicken was cold, the orange chicken itself was also cold and hard, not nice and chewy and flavorful like I remember. My husband's pasta was watery and was cold as well, no salt, no flavor. We tried to make the best of it and tried to eat it as is, but stopped about 1/4 of the way through and just could not take another bite. We were waiting for the server to come by to tell him, but he didn't come by for another 30min. By then, we just wanted to go home. I told him that the food was horrible and we just wanted the check. He said that we should've told him earlier so that he could've told his manager and the cooks and given us other options. (Um, maybe if you didn't take 30min to check on us?) But, apparently we had eaten some of it and we no longer would be credible. WHAT? We ate 1/4 of the plate because we attempted to deal with it. If it were good, trust me, the plates would have been CLEAN, no food left on them. My husband and I are huge foodies.  I heard the waiter talk to his manager behind us, trying to get us a discount I guess (nice of him), but his manager just shrugged his shoulders and we were given our $70 bill for the appetizer we ate and 1/4 portion we could stomach down. NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO BACK TO CF. I don't know if it's just this location because it's downtown, but it really put a dent in my loyalty to CF. Utterly disappointed.  Worst part, it ruined my birthday. Thanks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=400,2.96,3.27,3.228,2.5640000000000005,3.146

Unfortunately, one of their wait staff spilled food all over by suit and shoes when I was there on business and when I attempted to send the manager the cleaning bill, they never responded.  Besides this, the reason this establishment gets 1 star is the absurd corporate policy of sending out kids menu food on plates to hot to the touch.

We just wanted a nice dinner with our kids on our last night in Chicago. We checked in at 4:45 and it was an hour wait. We waited outside where a ton of other people were also waiting.  It was pretty much an hour and it was our turn. We were seated in a corner booth. At least 10 minutes later our hurried waiter finally appeared. We ordered our drinks and meals at that time. At least 10 minutes after that our bread came. At least 15 - 20 minutes after that our food came.  I got the chicken bellagio which was actually wonderful. My husband had the chicken and biscuit which was just ""eh"" and the kids had mini corn dogs, chicken strips and pasta Parmesan. My daughters fries were not brought out with her meal and she was pretty much done eating by the time they arrived.  The waiter never really asked how we were doing. He was running around like a maniac which made us feel hurried and on edge. NOT a relaxing meal. He did keep our glasses full.  We ordered our cheesecakes to go. Paid and left.  Within 20 minutes of leaving all four of my kids were sick with upset stomachs and diarrhea. Not a good experience when you have one bathroom in the hotel and they are fighting over who has to go worse. Something they used in the food destroyed their bowels. After an hour they were good again.  We brought back two slices of cheesecake. A cherry and a dulce de leche. Must say ""super disappointed"". Very little flavor, whipped cream was blah- had absolutely no sweetener in it and might as well been butter on top. Couldn't finish either slice.

256,Dana M.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,4.0,5.0,2014-11-11,"I'm writing this review to let people know about my experience and to advise them to choose the Cheesecake Factory for a nice time. As a usual consumer, I am interested in well-cooked dishes, high quality of food, unusual atmosphere and relatively acceptable prices. I would recommend you the Cheesecake factory, as it includes all of those options. To begin with, I want to highlight a wide range of dishes and their unusual big portions.  The Cheesecake Factory has his own extraordinary atmosphere. It creates a special mood among guests. I was really impressed by a unique décor, which makes you feel like you are in a fairytale: the nicely subdued light, pleasant music playing on the background, white-dressed waiters.  It is very clear from these observations that the Cheesecake Factory has all options to serve guests best and exceed their expectations. If you are interested in high service, appetizing food, unusual and out-of-the way atmosphere, so the Cheesecake Factory is a great alternative for you. When I came to the Cheesecake Factory, I liked immediately the service of this place. The stuff find to you a table and they present a menu. Before to take the order, they bring to you a glass of water and than I ordered pasta. A big plate of pasta Fettuccine Alfredo, that could be divided among 3 persons, surprised me. It is a common fact that the bigger the size of portions the bigger the price. The Cheesecake Factory is an exception to this rule. In addition, the dishes are not just large they are extremely tasty. It is an indisputable advantage that makes consumers happy.  The Cheesecake Factory has the most various and delicious range of cheesecake flavors such as: Oreo, Pumpkin, Red Velvet Cake and so on. I ordered the Strawberry cheesecake, which was so delicious and looked really beautiful. Deserts make people happy and the Cheesecake Factory knows how to do it best.

184,Colin M.,"Crown Point, IN",2,40,6.0,3.0,2014-12-17,"Came here with a group of co-workers on Saturday night. My first ever Cheesecake Factory Experience, and only because someone else picked it. Honestly, after reading the ""Eat This Not Thant"" horror stories, I wanted to run screaming from this place. They have arguably the ""Worst Dish In America"" with their Bistro Shrimp pasta, clocking in at over 2200 calories per serving. That's more than a days worth of calories in one gloppy plate of pasta! Que horreur! But, it was either beg off dinner or join the group. So I joined the group. Kudo's on the Skinnylicious Menu. They have a number of selections advertised as less than 590 calories, so I guess that is acceptable. Mostly these selections are salads or fish (or a combination of both).  I had the chopped salad, which contained chicken, apple, corn and avocado and it was pretty good. I didn't trust the calorie count so I didn't finish it. My seatmate to the right had the grilled ahi tuna salad, which he was very pleased with. He literally ate every last morsel of salad on the plate. I personally don't like raw tuna, but he really found the meal excellent. His wife ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, and again, she said she really enjoyed it. I was told that she never likes anything she gets at a restaurant, so this was really a victory for The Cheesecake Factory.  One of my table mates had the appetizer chicken Caesar salad, and it was enormous. We all said, ""This is the appetizer size???"" Honestly, it was entree sized. But good, reportedly.  There were other, acceptable dishes on the table, none so good that they warrant inclusion in this review. The only other thing to note was the size of the desserts. Again, one slice of cheesecake was as big as the entree. Ginormous. And the very slender woman who ordered it dispatched it down her alimentary canal with alacrity. I don't know how a very slender woman can eat 3000 calories worth of food and stay slender. So all in all, I would have to say that the Cheesecake Factory wasn't bad. Service was decent.

In short, a friend and I just wanted cheesecake. We specified this to the host and she gave us a pager w/ my name and told us it would be 20 minutes.  30 minutes go by, and after lingering around the bar and stepping outside for a cigarette I decided to go check on the time at the host stand. Apparently my name and pager wasn't on the list. They had done a shift change so the hostess was not the one I was dealing with before. She explained to me that our name wasn't on the list anymore. I requested a manager. I knew it wasn't her fault.  So Julie, the manager, comes and speaks with me and I explain the situation. She checks the host stand with the hostess and the previous hostess had noted that ""we walked away"". What? Like, you think I want to take this pager to-go with me? No, I was walking around the bar and hanging by the front of the restaurant. I am aware and I made it clear that I knew it wasn't the current hostess's fault. I work in the industry so these things happen and it just sucks. Fortunately Julie was able to seat us immediately.  Unfortunately, the waitress we had must have caught wind of the situation and wasn't very pleasant. We were very nice to her so it was a shame she didn't greet us and introduce herself like she did to the other tables around us. My friend even told the hostess and manager that it was my birthday, but I didn't get a candle or any kind of ""happy birthday"" from anyone.  I've had issues with this place before in getting seated and not stellar service. But I guess that's what you get with corporate chain restaurants.

165,Chad R.,"Denver, CO",51,153,,2.0,2015-06-24,"Thought it'd be funny to try one out while at this Chicago conference (nothing ""wrong"" with the brand, per se, but not my thing (you know?))-- joke was on me. It was 62 degrees in there. I had to blow in my hands the entire meal, and spent most of my time looking around at others and commiserating with them while they complained to their 'other/s' about how cold it was. A single tear streaks down my cheek, as I've only got Yelp at this meal. In fact, I need to take a break from typing this to sit on my hands because I'm losing feeling in them. Okay, I'm back-- so what else about this joint?  Highlight comes via the hostess station: these girls is a bunch of sour pusses, for real.  The only time they smile is when they swing through a server station to flirt with a guy or talk trash about the one coworker also seating (possibly manager) who is obviously not like the others. I'll just leave it at that. They clearly lack knowledge about the concept of situational awareness, too. I've seen them give the gasface to at least a dozen families/groups because, I imagine, they're ""not sitting down fast enoughjustsitdown,God!"" If you work here a few times a week, and stand at a crappy little podium with a map of the joint, you'll likely be more comfy there. Customers, on the other hand, particularly ones that don't frequent the place, want to gauge the light, or whether or not they're sitting under the full blast AC, or are identifying exits, or who knows what but why is your sour little gas face in such a hurry to get back to the podium?  You ain't smilin' or greetin'. You just gasfacin'. And you get paid by the hour, not by the guest (or gasface). Look, the food's good, right?  But I can't imagine ever coming back to this atmosphere. Above comments are completely exclusive of my server, Lauren, who was rad. Although she kept calling me 'sir' when I'm obviously not that kind of customer, made it known, and she must've known anyhow because it was weird EVERY single time.

Decided on the grilled fish tacos. By this time my glass was empty! Gave the bartender my food order with the hopes that he would notice the empty glass. No such luck today. I give it a few minute more and finally I ask for a refill on the Titos. Again no lime! Fast forward 20 minutes and still no food. I notice a few people who came in after me getting food, so I ask are the tacos coming soon? ""yes I sent someone to check on them."" the bartender replied as he turn to a passing server and says ""hey can you check on grilled fish tacos?"". About four minutes later a runner appears with the tacos. I dig into the black beans n rice, and they are luke warm at best. Okay you got me. They were cool at best. I attempted to eat the tacos, which were flavorful and well presented. I picked one up and the tortilla fell apart and the fish was cold. Warning! These tacos had been setting under a heatlamp for sometime getting cold and saturated with moisture. If I had more time I would've waited for them to fix the dish. Unfortunately I was meeting a friend at another location so my quick dinner turned into a ""I wish it was a better experience"". The bartender sends for the manager and this took forever. Finally he (manager) arrives, but the bartender had left to find him. The who's on second scenario.

The service is ok but nothing special, I usually find that the waiters are doing a lot more running around than actually waiting on people and tend to slack on the extra stuff you might request, like more water, extra dressing or more bread. I've also found that if you're having a more ""basic"" dinner (meaning no appetizers or fancy drinks) that they tend to really leave you alone and often leave you with empty water glasses. On the flip side, if you both order a drink when you first meet the waiter, they're never going to stop hounding you.

Customers are standing and waiting to be seated in line. They get pagers to know when their table is finally ready. And it can take 15 or even 30 minutes. To my mind the place is not the most delicious or prestigious or anything to spend so much time waiting. Time waiting for to go food is enormous too. And I heard the clients were not very happy with the service. Of course if it's called the ""Cheesecake Factory"" - their cheesecakes are good. But as for the food on the menu, it's absolutely ordinary and there is nothing to droll that much about, it's a chain restaurant and besides in some other their locations the service is much better.

Our waiter was friendly and gave us good service however the quality of the food was bad. The bread that was brought to our table was cold and hard.  I ordered a Pineapple Mojito, and it was made poorly, it mirrored coconut water, sugar, and a few mints.  I sent it back and ordered a Mai Thai, which was also made incorrectly. My mother ordered a Mai Thai which was perfect , mines tasted like a completely different drink.  I requested that it be remade, I am assuming the bartender finally put a little passion and focus into the drink, because the third drink was great.  I typically order the chicken madeira but decided match it up (Factory Combination) with the shrimp scampi. My mother ordered the Southern fried catfish, which was overcooked. My chicken maderia was prefect as usual, however the shrimp scampi was not freshly made. It was obviously prep and left to sit, the shrimp texture was soggy and room temperature.  I am really disappointed  in the lack of attention that went into the food and drinks. I did not expect to receive fast food quality food.  We ordered two more Mai Thai  and finished our appetizer of buffalo wings, it was the only item that was made correctly.

I'm a fan of all the cheesecakes that incorporate some type of chocolate cake.  - The restaurant is huge so the wait is not as long as it may seem when you walk into the place. On a busy Saturday my friend and I only had to wait between 20 to 30 minutes.  - The employees, from the waiters to the busboys, here always seem to maintain a positive attitude even when they are obviously swamped with the amount of tables they have to juggle - Depending on what you order you can get a large meal that is probably at minimum two servings for a reasonable price.  Cons:  - This location it's always packed with tourist so you're always guaranteed to wait no matter the time of date.  - If it wasn't for the Cheesecake I don't think anyone over 18 would eat here. The food quality is sub par at best so they give you a serving size that could feed a family of 4.  - Due to this location always being so busy you always have a 50/50 chance of your food being cold.

She was attentive to my daughter and to me and did her best to provide excellent service.  We were seated outside, and were served within a reasonable amount of time. The food was alright. My daughter's kid's meal salmon looked excellent and cooked perfectly. My pork chop took a bit longer and was tough.  Mid-meal, with a young child, it is only normal to go to the bathroom. As we were seated so close to a public area, I took my kid and my bag and we went inside the restaurant. We were gone for 4-6 minutes, and returned to see our table had been cleared and set for the next guests. The restaurant was no longer full though!  I went inside to share this news with the hostess whose first comment was ""it's because you didn't leave any personal belongings"". Ummm.. of course I didn't. It's a big city.  Manager was called over by our server and he was nothing but polite and apologetic. Pure class and professionalism. Not only did they comp the meal (naturally.. who would pay for something they didn't get to finish) but also re-fired a new chop for me and threw in 2 pieces of cheesecake for the road.  Moral of the story: sometimes, mistakes are made, but what's important is how you recover from them. This manager won me over despite an unfortunate situation, and it is to his (and the restaurant's) credit.

Cool to see that their menu looks relatively unchanged for the most part. More recently I tried the Louisiana Chicken Pasta (Parmesan Crusted Chicken Served Over Pasta with Mushrooms, Peppers and Onions in a Spicy New Orleans Sauce), and it was delicious and definitely enough to feed two. Prices still seem to be the same from what I remember years ago as well and great to see they don't hike up the prices for being in a tourist heavy spot along Michigan Avenue.

Distracts me from thinking about when the ordered food will come. We ordered the Luau salad. Let me tell you something, that salad was GIGANTIC AND DELICIOUS. The portion was good enough to share with 2-3 people. The second dish we ordered was the Chicken Picatta, it was good but a bit too sour for my taste (had lemon in the sauce).  As for appetizers, here comes the bad part of the review. We ordered the portabello, zucchini and avocado fries and the blue cheese pear flatbread (Pear blue cheese flatbread?). I expected shaved pears on the flatbread but instead there were this huge chunks of pears which made the flatbread disgusting or maybe it was the taste of those chunks of pears. I took all the pears out and it was a bit better. The avocado zucchini and portabello fries, they tasted pretty good. It was hard to tell what I was eating but my mom had an incident with the dish. She took a piece and started chewing and few seconds after I see her face change and pull out something from her mouth and seconds after a second thing from her mouth as well. She found TWO pieces of wire (one was probably 5cm long and the other one was 1cm long). We were all shocked and immediately called the waiter. I was so upset because it happened to my mom and if she swallowed those pieces of wire it would have been a bigger deal. I informed the waiter we found two pieces in the food while she was eating it. He called the manager and she spoke to us. She told us she knew exactly where they were coming from (fryer baskets).  The mananger kindly apologized and offered us complimentary dessert. We didn't want to make it a huge deal since my mom was fine and it was only the shock at that moment and a lot of customers sitting around us noticed the incident, so we took a piece of cheesecake and left things that way. We asked if the item could be removed from the check since we barely touched it and her response was ""of course, absolutely. I will take care of that"". When we asked for the check... THE APPETIZER WAS CHARGED! It was probably miscommunication but we told the server that the manager clearly stated that we were not going to have to pay for that appetizer. The server took care of it and we tipped him accordingly since the whole thing was not his (or the manager's) fault.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=20,2.68,3.21,3.108,2.2199999999999998,2.9979999999999998

However, over the weekend, our experience with this Cheesecake Factory was almost unbearable. My boyfriend and I both ordered the spicy chicken sandwich with chipotle mayo... Everything looked ok, nothing special about the presentation, but the moment we both bit into the sandwich, it was like biting into a piece of chicken coated in soggy breading. And had no flavor whatsoever. Literally tasted like fried, soggy buttery bread. Horrible. Not even the ""spicy"" mayo did anything to help it. Literally took one bite and threw it in the garbage. My son ordered the macaroni and cheese burger. When I looked at the presentation, it had to be one of the most unappealing things I've seen in a long time. The fried macaroni should be a nice golden color sitting on top of the burger, but instead it looked like a rubbery gray-brown ball. My son could barely stomach one bite. My other son had the kid chicken tenders; they were just as bad as our chicken sandwiches. The only redeeming factor about the meal was our appetizer of the fried avocado egg rolls. But even those were mediocre. My experience picking up the food was also unpleasant. Already waited in a line for close to 10 minutes and when I got to the register and told her my name and that I was here to pickup my order, she looked around almost confused, then found a receipt and told me ""she couldn't ring me up because she didn't take the order."" She proceeded to call the other waiter to come to the register which took about another 6-7 minutes. Both girls at the register were rude, and unapologetic. I will never be taking my business here again. Horrible food and customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=340,2.52,3.17,3.064,2.02,2.9099999999999997

It was late (9:30 pm) and not busy at all.  Yet the hostess put me, a party of one, in a small cramped area surrounded on all sides by larger, louder parties. It was uncomfortably loud in that 20 sq feet, but I could hear every word of these 10 conversations because the rest of the restaurant was largely empty.  I had to wait about 15 minutes before anyone stopped by. After I got my beverage it was another five minutes to place my order. The food was good but I had to ask for things that weren't coming out. Seems the late hour was a factor, but then I'm not the one who advertises meal service until 11:30. They could tell me it's coming in a minute, or make me find the server to inquire. Personally I'd rather if they just told me, seems simpler. When I was ready to leave I had to wait about ten minutes before my server stopped again so I could settle up. To his credit he got the tab out and ran my card lickity split, but I was surprised dessert was not mentioned.

161,Hai L.,"Chicago, IL",3,6,,1.0,2016-11-25,"I have always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. I thought it was a great place that always aimed to please. Until I went to the Michigan ave location in Chicago. Now I get it, I was there on the Friday after thanksgiving. They did do some things right but they def need to make sure the do some training of the staff.   Something around the lines of even though it's really busy doesn't mean we take each customer for granted.  So I finished some shopping and stopped into the bar area. Yes they are busy. No I don't expect presidential treatment. Just the normal I would normally get from a place that has always treated me well. Well where things went right, like I said it was busy. So the wait was long. But someone came to me to explain the situation and I did think that was a very nice gesture. I told him that I understood it is very busy and the food was out a few minutes after. That was good. What went wrong.  The food was very late and no bread was EVER offered while waiting. In fact I forgot that was even an option until they served me some AFTER my meal at which point I said I'm good. No need to waste food.  The breakfast sandwich finally came out on what looked like hard toasted buttered white bread. I asked the bartender about this and she said that's the way it is. Not wanting to cause a fuss I said it seems like white bread but whatever. I ate the inside and left the bread in a pile on the side. The bartender just grabbed it without a second glass and took it away. I don't know but if I were a waiter and saw a half eaten meal that was just questioned i would ask if everything was okay with the meal. Not a peep. I guess i as the customer is supposed to raise hell and be the bad guy?  Anyways finished my drink and left. Will not eat at this particular location again.  I know it was busy but some things should just be obvious from a server point of view.  Maybe I gave a tourist vibe out that they will never come back again or something.  To end maybe after DNA testing it would be found that it was brioche. But I clearly was not happy with the meal. I guess I just don't like the idea of paying for a nice sit down meal if I will be treated like I am at a soup kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=200,2.48,3.1,3.048,2.212,2.8520000000000003

But, I did, this time, because my littlest baby girl said, ""... come on mom let's go...""  To the Cheesecake Factory ""downtown""...A definite magical atmosphere, however, the service leaves me a little disappointed for the ""downtown"" location. They were busy, but the wait wasn't too long - about 20 minutes. Our table was so close to the other table, that when the other party exited they could sit and nearly did on our table. I guess it's all about packing them in like sardines. Truly, this detracts from the dining experience, (and it should be an experience when it's ""downtown"" - maybe I just don't get out much and this is how it is ""downtown""), but it's so loud! There was all that dining space upstairs - empty...  Our waiter didn't pull the chair for me, which I thought was what was supposed to happen in an upscale ""downtown"" restaurant, especially, when the older person is closest to you. And speaking of age... although, not major, my daughter who does have a young face, wasn't carded! Her pride was offended - but not their fault - she's getting older and looks 21+. The silverware wasn't clean as was the menu. The food was their regular, (like the Oakbrook location) - so I'm of the mind they can do this with their eyes closed. It was tasty, once home the avocado rolls didn't re-heat too well - again this is not their fault, however, since I had eaten lite I was looking forward to a dessert, so I was shocked when the waiter assumed we were not having a dessert and came with the check. No dessert menu. I didn't request the check. I got the feeling he thought it was time to turn the table over for his next tip - I don't know what he thought but I did want my dessert - really it's my main treat for going out - especially to the CHEESECAKE FACTORY!

My boyfriend spent nearly $20 on two small pieces of cheesecake, and there wasn't an apology or understanding or anything. The lemon raspberry cheesecake is ehhh. Do not recommend. The bottom was a little soggy and while it has an acceptable lemon flavor, so does the raspberry sauce on it. Could've tasted the actual raspberry part of it more. 1/5 The white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake is bomb. We get it every time we stop by.

For our second round of drinks she brought me a margarita instead of Sangria and said ""they are both Mexican drinks""....(FALSE). When my meal actually came out she forgot my creamed corn.. I believe the main issue was that she decided to not use a note pad so she had to come back and confirm what we actually wanted. The most aggravating part of the whole experience was that every time she made a mistake she would make up some long excuse to try and make us feel sorry for her. She even mentioned that her son was at another table and that they were caught up talking.

The other one was also sweet, although the sweetness was balanced by the slightly acidic raspberry coulis it was served with. Flavour-wise I give the cheesecakes 3.5 stars. For a really really delicious 5 star cheesecake, check out my review for Texas de Brazil! When it comes to the service, the guy who took our order, I believe his name was Juan, was very nice and friendly. He happily answered any questions the customers had about the different cakes and also came with suggestions based on your preferences. The service is a clear 5 star rating.  Although the awesome service brings up the rating, I would like to base this review on the food experience alone, which is why I give it 3 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=20,2.76,2.78,2.972,2.636,2.772

However, I must say that the bar is simply amazing. I've never seen bartenders work more efficiently and without breaks. The drinks may be a bit pricey, but they're not unreasonable given the location, and I promise you won't ever have something as wonderful as their strawberry martini. Just last week I drank over $100 worth of them in one sitting. So if you care about not getting fat or acquiring diabetes, don't eat there.

I'd recommend you visit one of their locations that isn't a zoo.  The service at this place is atrocious. I've been here three times (it's just such a convenient location!), and it's probably the most *consistently bad* service I've seen at a place. They cram too many people into the limited space. We had people within arm's reach on both sides, so that it felt like we were in an awkward triple-date with strangers. No dinner conversations here are private.  The waiter will visit your table a couple times an hour, when they get around to it. Our entrées this time took around 45 minutes. The manager came by but offered no explanation or recompense.  The cherry on top was when, on finally seeing our waiter again after dinner, we asked to see the dessert menu. He informed us that it was just too busy by the kitchen and it was hard for him to put in orders. Yup, that's right, we went to the Cheesecake Factory and were told by our waiter that it would be too burdensome if we were to actually order some cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=80,3.36,2.84,2.972,2.184,3.048

Mash potato is awesome, Broccoli was just dipped in hot water (very crunchy with no seasoning at all). friend salad (BBQ chicken - replace chicken with shrimp) was very very good, however they charged 7# extra for ~ 8 pieces of shrimp and didn't put the chicken!! i thought that i a rip off since we asked for replacement (i know shrimp can be more expensive but they were small and only 8 pieces). but anyways we enjoyed the seating. Cheese cake was awesome like always (Godiva)  Waiter was out of this world and I mean he came a couple of times to confirm order, Napkins translated to more silverware.

My family drove in from Michigan and I drove in from St Louis for the day. My niece LOVES Cheesecake factory and we were uber excited about ending our day of family fun there! (especially after our HORRIFIC experience at the Cheesecake Factory in St. Louis back in April) Well, let me tell you.  This location came in for runner up of the worst Cheesecake Factory that I have ever been to!  I'm sure by now you want details. Well, I am about to fill you in.  To begin. Me, My Aunt, and 3 nieces sat for about 10 minutes without being offered water or ANYTHING. Finally, the waiter offers us beverages. When he returns he manages to spill my niece's lemonade all over the table. Yes, accidents happen BUT this man did not apologize and he also DID NOT LIFT A FINGER TO CLEAN UP THE MESS! Yes, you heard that HE DID NOT LIFT A FINGER TO CLEAN UP THE ENTIRE MUG OF SPILLED LEMONADE. My aunt and niece cleans up this mess and he returns close to 5 minutes later with a new lemonade. He had the audacity to look irritated when I asked for a wet cloth so that we can clean the table and it not be sticky. After receiving the wet cloth HE WATCHED MY AUNT WIPE THE TABLE DOWN. I thought the situation was comical and said to him, ' I cant believe you're just going to watch her clean the table."" After my joking statement he still DID NOT HELP MY AUNT CLEAN THE TABLE. He grabbed a busser as she passed and said, ""Can you wipe this down THEY SPILLED A DRINK."" (DID YOU CATCH THAT? NHE BLAMED IT ON US)  Everyone at our table was freezing and we asked to move tables due to the draft of cold air. Guess what. We were just blatantly told NO! ARE YOUU SERIOUS! So, after that we much needed an adult beverage! I ordered a Whiskey Smash and my aunt ordered a Bellini of some sort. We ordered our food and was never offered another drink EVER!  After a great deal of time our food arrived and mine was cold and my Southern Fried Catfish was undercooked.  This was the visit from hell!   Jesus!

33,Jordan C.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",94,2,,1.0,2017-12-04,Ordered a single appetizer for takeout and its now been over 45 minutes I've been waiting. Absolutely shocking.

57,Emily F.,"Kearney, NE",36,3,,1.0,2017-12-04,"Dinner started out fine. The the crab artichoke appetizer was delicious. However, after a 35 minute wait for your entree and then finding a grill pick mixed in your pasta was not very appetizing. The server never apologized, just got a manger who did not do much. Decided to order dessert, which took another 25 minutes to get. A waste of 2.5 hours and my money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=60,2.32,2.79,2.912,,2.6020000000000003

71,Brooke D.,"Chicago, IL",118,3,4.0,1.0,2017-12-18,"Last night we visited for dinner at 9:30pm,service was terrible. After being sat and quickly greeted by our waiter it was all down hill from there. Order appetizers that took a extremely longer that usual time for and arrived luke warm, waiter was attentive to the large group across from us while our drinks sat empty. Filet was over cooked requested a medium well, received a crisp over cooked well done burnt steak. Waiter did not check on our order until we were half way through our dinner as he was more concerned with the large group next to us, cracking jokes and splitting checks for a group of at least 20. Also found it odd that the restaurant chose to pull their wait staff off the floor to loudly sing happy birthday in the kitchen for another staff member in the middle of service. Chose to order cheesecake from the counter since our waiter was no where to be found, counter employee was rude as well. When exiting and passing the host stand witnessed a male employee massaging a Female employee at the host stand.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=40,2.2,2.78,2.92,,2.548
19,Sarah Q.,"Elmwood Park, IL",2,46,1.0,1.0,2017-12-20,"Originally I would have given a much better review, unfortunately Cheesecake does not have a consistency of providing guests with great service not meals. When they are busy the quality decreases and unfortunately that is a deal breaker for any restaurant that operates in that manner! I feel that management needs to get their priorities straight and implement a plan to provide consistent high quality service as well as food on the menu!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago,2.2,2.75,2.908,,2.5300000000000002

8,Alexis S.,"Chicago, IL",73,1,1.0,4.0,2018-01-01,"I was really skeptical about getting the ""BANG BANG CHICKEN & SHRIMP"" only because it was Thai. Thai is usually spicy. I wanted to enjoy my meal not have to fan my mouth....BUT I ordered it anyway... & I'm glad I did !!!! It was AMAZING!! Flavors were very consistent across the palette. It was very delicious. It came served over your choose of brown or white rice. I ordered white with mine.

1,Jonna N.,"Chicago, IL",129,148,450.0,1.0,2018-01-02,"I went for the first time for my birthday dinner and it did not sit well in my stomach. We waited 45 minutes and spent most of that time in Water tower killing time waiting. I knew I would have to wait so I wasn't bothered. When we walked back in near the hostess, a busser asked us if we were just 2 and sat us down near the kitchen. So we didn't have to wait more. That was nice to be seated so fast. We got bread, drinks and our food in a timely manner, but halfway through eating my food my stomach hurt and I had to run to the bathroom. I got the bow-tie pasta with chicken and it did look greasy. I wouldn't go here again. I avoided the cheesecake, too. I didn't have an appetite to eat it. For birthdays, they only decorate the dessert cheesecake plate with happy birthday and you don't even get a discount or free cheesecake. Not worth going to again. I should have avoided this chain from the start.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago,2.24,2.71,2.908,,2.5220000000000002
