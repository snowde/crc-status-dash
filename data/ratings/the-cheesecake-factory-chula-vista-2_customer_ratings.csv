Went in on a Wednesday at 3:30pm, I mentioned to my son that I'd never been in a Cheesecake Factory when it was not crowded. We informed the African American young man who was the host, that there was 4 in our party. The restaurant was not crowded but we were left waiting for 10 minutes. The host left but came out when an African American couple came in and he sat them immediately. We were shocked, the restaurant was empty. When we did get seated I asked to speak to the manager the host's response was ""really"". He then said they were busy and in a meeting. I told the young man when they were done I would like to see them. When the manager did come out, his response was to just apologies. It is just bad business, customer service is a high commodity.

The kids had a burger and pizza respectively.  Both off of the adult menu because they're greedy like that (yet not overweight, otherwise they would have been fed salads with vinaigrette). Fiancé had the ribeye with a side of Mac and cheese.  He, like I always do, ordered his steak mid-rare.  It was unfortunately overcooked.  Not terribly overcooked, but enough to not be perfect.  It was still pink, but we like our steaks mooing.....sort of.   The adults had a veggie burger, turkey sandwich and a shrimp platter.  I didn't hear any complaints so I will assume it was all good.

If anything stood out it wouldve been the ""Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake"". I'm not a fan of red velvet cake so imagine my suprise when I tasted what had to be the best cheesecake ever!!!! My second experience didnt fare any better then the first. For appetizers I ordered the cheese triangles, stuffed mushrooms, and crab artichoke dip. I didnt taste the cheese triangles as they were meant for the kiddos. But, you know its pretty bad when a 5 year old comments that its burnt and refuses to eat it. I love stuffed mushrooms and lets just say I took one bite and decided to pass. My 11 year year old on the other hand found it tasty and ate about 2 or 3 of them. The crab artichoke tasted like watery claim chowder. I took one bite and decided to send it back. It was supposed to be crab meat and artichoke but from the taste and looks of it I would say it was shredded tilapia with chunks of potatoe. Now on to the main dish. I ordered the Steak Dianne and Shrimp Scampi with mashed potatoes. The steak was ""okay"" it tasted like a heated tv dinner drowned in gravy and sliced mushrooms. The shrimp was horrible! I've never had battered, deep fried, shrimp drowned in tomatoes and spinach classified as scampi. Lets just say I ate less then half of one shrimp. You know your meal is pretty bad when your staring at your childs cheese and pepperoni pizza as if its the best dish on the table. In hopes of saving what had already been a total loss I ordered the red velvet cheesecake to go. I was not disappointed. In my opinon if your looking for a decent meal in the area. Go to Chilis and fill yourself up with those honey chipotle chicken crispers. Or if your into Asian Cusine stop by P.F. Changs and order a few barbeque spare ribs. On your way home stop by the Cheesecake Factory for the Ulimate Red Velvet Cheesecake. In all honesty they need to stick to what they know, ""Cheesecake"". The food is horrible.

Unfortunately, our recent experience at this location has left a real sour taste in our mouth. Upon arrival we had kindly asked the greeter/maitre d to seat us in a certain location of the restaurant in which we like. He gave us an attitude and told us that it would take a while because ""they had to clean the table"" I understood that we would wait 5-10 minutes to get to our table, but the attitude and tone was extremely unnecessary and rude. Upon seating we had noticed how hastily and ill - prepared the table was in comparison to the others around us and was shocked to see food in the crevices of our forks. We had alerted our waitress and she had brought us fresh silverware. After we ordered our food, it arrived at a temperature that seemed colder than it should.""(The Green Sauce  Carnitas Chilaquiles"" Was very cold and tasted very 'cafeteria' like) However we tried to enjoy our brunch the best we could, but we were shocked to find out that  this restaurant has a major FLY problem. 5-10 flys were next to our table, swarming around. Landing on our straws, food, and even table. They were climbing up the windows, and landing on our hair. I & my wife were repulsed by this atrocity, and alerted one of the bus-boys. He claimed to have told the manager, however nothing was done. We ordered over a hundred dollars worth of food, beverages, and cheesecake for our small party of 3, and we left a good tip like honest people. We went into this restaurant hoping for a great Sunday brunch. But ended up getting very bad food, and TERRIBLE service. We really love the food at cheesecake factory and hope to return, but some serious action, and even Pest Extermination, needs to be done.

On this particular night, the mall was having a free movie screening so my friend and I decided to make the drive. We had dinner at this particular Cheesecake Factory location after the movie screening and sat at the bar. We were greeted and waited on by Jeremy. He was very pleasant and attentive and just gave overall great service. My friend and I had a comfortable, overall great experience with our food and drinks (btw, the summer rolls and the White Chicken Chili on the Skinnylicious Menu are DELICIOUS!). We paid and left and made the drive back home. When I got home I realized that I left my iPhone on the bar, right where I was sitting. You can imagine my horror at this realization as I don't have a landline and my husband was out of town on business. I drove manically to my friend's house and was able to call my phone.

The place was not busy. So the server comes out  to our table trying to make conversation by asking what brings you here, what school did you graduate from, what are your plans afterwards, what college are you going to attend and he kept going on and on. My daughter and our group felt very uncomfortable. Felt like an interrogation.  Anyway, we ordered our meal and asked for water and to keep the water coming because we had been standing for the last three hours for my daughters graduation. Well, the water did not come. The order was screwed up, we asked for some brown bread and were told that they were out. But, then I noticed a few tables were being served that same bread. I asked the server about and he did not know anything about it. I am not saying because my daughters boyfriend is African American the service was poor.  My wife ordered a drink and was waiting 20 minutes and still it had not arrived. I asked the server and He did not know what was going on.  I replied, ""I guess its like the bread and you just ran out.""  A few minutes later the manager came out and apologized and took more of our time. By that time, the dinner was already destroyed and the event became one that you wanted to take the morning after pill to just forget. The manager offered to take the drink we did not receive off the bill and one slice of cheesecake. I did not want to argue even though I felt it was a slap in the face. I just wanted to get the hell out of there. I even  gave a 18% tip for probably the worst meal of my life. The only reason why, I did not want too look cheap in front of my daughter and did not want to destroy   her special day any further.

The wait is usually 5-15 minutes which isn't bad at all.  The place is very large and spacious and has a great bar area. If the wait is longer than 20 minutes my family and I usually just grab a table by the bar. If you have a large party then this is the place to come. They're very accommodating to large parties but if you're a group of teens just remember to be polite. I know a lot of waiters don't like looking after a bunch of wild teens.  As for the food, it's just your standard Cheesecake Factory food. The burgers are great here! I usually get a burger whenever I come. Other items that I love are the Miso Salmon, the Chicken Salad Sandwich, and the Pasta DaVinci.  If you find that Cheesecake Factory is a bit overpriced then come here during lunch! You basically get the same portion for a couple dollars cheaper. The lunch pasta is still huge for just $11! The Renee's Special is another great lunch special which includes half a sandwich, salad, and a soup. It's a great deal if you ask me. The service can sometimes be hit or miss though, that's where I take off a star. Sometimes you get great service and other times you barely get a visit from your waiter, he/she forgets everything, and the food takes forever! Also you can't just play on your phone here since the reception is horrible. Just keep asking for more free bread and you'll be ok. Overall this is a pretty good Cheesecake Factory location and I prefer it to the Fashion Valley location.  (PS.

We ordered appetizers those arrived at the same time as our main meal which was also when we found out that they ran out of the spinach dip after we had talked to the manager the server was really skiddish towards us it took her forever to do anything she dropped off our check and then when we had a question about it she sent someone else over to us end result was we talked to the other manager she apologized to us about our experience our bill was $116.00 and we got shitty service!!!

I just said okay because I didn't know what else I wanted to order.  It was gross and way too salty.  The polenta fries do not taste like any polenta I have ever eaten - the polenta is all blended to mush and it almost tastes like a mozzarella stick.  Almost every time I order my favorite appetizer (buffalo blasts) they take forever to come out and the servers always come and apologize, but then never comp it or even offer a free soft drink.  Once I ordered take out and it took over 30 minutes to get my food.

I had ordered my 2yo the macaroni from the children's menu, good portion, looked tasty, but I noticed small black pieces in the food.  At first I thought it was pepper but didn't recall them, or any restaurant putting ground pepper on a child's macaroni.  After further inspection and digging through the food, I found larger pieces of what was metal! I pointed it out to the waiter, who offered to bring out another one.  We got the second plate...and same thing!!  I found little pieces of black metal in the food!!!  Granted we were almost done with our meals, my two year old was hungry and couldn't understand why I kept taking his food away when all he wanted to do was eat it.  The waiter never offered to bring out something else on the house.  We politely asked for the check, and mind you I was pretty patient with them during this whole process even though my child was now fussy from not eating, but when I saw he had charged me for a child's meal that wasn't even edible, I made the decision to boycott this place for a while.  I had him remove the item from our bill and explained to him that in my opinion, the least they could of done was offer my son something else to eat free of charge for our hassle and patience.   I never reported these incidences to the Health Inspection Agency, but they are both note worthy to be complaints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=440,3.32,3.35,3.35,3.1440000000000006,3.338

The manager came out in seconds to apologized. Before we can even finish our conversation hot food was out and our bill taken care of.

105,Lany H.,"Chula Vista, CA",46,51,1.0,2.0,2014-04-23,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory many times before. I think the only promising thing about it to me is the Happy Hour from 4-6. $5 appetizers/select mixed drinks & $3 select beers. Make sure if you go, you double check your receipt because if it's 6:01, by the time you order something it's getting marked at full price. I've been during non-happy hour times and the cooking is just as mediocre. I got some fried mac n cheese that was still cold in the middle. The Fettucini Alfredo I ordered tasted like preservatives. The cheesecake is shipped in from somewhere and kept in a freezer somewhere until they thaw the slices and serve em up. It's good if you live in Chula Vista and can't drive anywhere.  I used to think this was an OK place to be taken on a date but the food is just not up to par anymore.

372,Edward R.,"Chula Vista, CA",14,10,4.0,2.0,2014-06-04,"Never in my life have I had such a horrible experience at a restaurant. Being one of the few groups waiting, we were informed of a 1-1.5 hour wait. We spoke to the curly-haired hostess regarding the possibility of splitting our part of 11 into two groups to get seated quicker. She strongly recommended we wait it out for all 11 of us to sit together.  As we waited a full two hours, we managed to grab a few drinks only to see parties of 4-8 people being seated left and right. It wasn't till after the two hour mark, were we finally seated.  I felt pretty embarrassed being ridiculed by some poor decision made by such an amateur hostess. Two of my guests were of age 85 and 86 and I was embarrassed to keep them out past 11:30pm when we had gotten to the restaurant by 8.  Keep in mind, we called the day prior only to be denied any reservation due to ""store policy."" On top of such a horrible experience before the meal, it was a slap in the face to see that the guests being seated before us (who arrived well after we did) so happened to be a vast majority of america (white) descent. While this bias may simply be coincidental, it's no excuse for being seated at a table where we have to wait 10 minutes for their signature bread and butter. Fortunately, a couple of drinks made the 30minute additional wait for food go by rather quickly.  While the food probably met company standards, the frustration and stress caused as a result of a poor, unorganized, unconcerned hostess was unacceptable.  I felt horrible that our server had to be a part of our unpleasing experience. He had the enthusiasm to provide a great experience but after the wait we were't having much of it. Props to him (bald guy I didn't catch his name). He did the best he can to make the remainder of our experience positive; as we have experienced at CCF in the past.  At the end of the night we still tipped our $300 bill and enjoyed a night with a couple of good drinks (shoutout to Josh the bartender).  My advice: Keep up the good work and re-train (or get rid of) hostesses that can't handle the responsibility of being the first impression of the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=300,3.56,3.34,3.34,2.9520000000000004,3.4280000000000004

However, their service is superior to all the other Cheesecake Factory's I have been to. We came here on Father's Day with a party of five. It seemed fairly busy, but we were seated at the time that was quoted. That's always a plus! After being seated we were waited on by Davon H. He was outstanding! He brought all of our drinks promptly, and even brought out all of my annoying requests quickly. They were out of sourdough bread at the time we arrived, so he kept following up and remembered to actually bring it after it was freshly baked. That almost never happens at a Cheesecake Factory. I ordered my usual Tomato Basil Pasta and loved it of course. My friend got the Fish and Chips and unfortunately the portion was skimpy and very cold. They tasted like they were sitting under the heat lamp for too long. I'm not sure how Davon took notice that he wasn't satisfied, but he quicky came over to ask what he thought. When he saw that my friend wasn't happy, he offered to replace the meal with no hesitation, brought his manager to recover the situation and even offered a soup or salad while he waited for his meal to come out. The new portion was much better...and actually hot. My other friend got the Chicken Bellagio and loved it! Their fettucine was just ok, and their Ribeye meal had no complaints all around. For dessert I splurged and got a slice of Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple. It was stuffed with fudge, PB, and even Butterfinger goodness. The slice was skimpy like most Cheesecake locations and there was a large portion of the cheesecake that didn't have any filling which kind of sucked.

I asked them to prepare the meat at a medium or pink all the way through and they delivered nicely ( ). The beef was juicy, tender, and had a very good beefy flavor that lingered on the palate. I liked both cheeses on the burger because the American melted easily, but the cheddar held up well and stated firm and sharp, so I got best of both worlds. The potato crisp added great texture and salty element to the burger, and the secret sauce brought the burger together nicely ( ). I was quite fond of this burger and was happy I had it on National Cheese Burger Day. The side salad was fresh and crispy, and I ordered it with their balsamic vinaigrette which was very good. It was the perfect go between the rich burger and such. The red velvet cheesecake was bliss. My sever Mitra I believe her name was, which I will correct when I find my receipt, if I am wrong, recommended it as her personal favorite. The slice was beautifully layered with cheese cake filling, white chocolate, and of course red velvet cake ( ). It was very rich in a very good way, and the red velvet cake was moist and flavorful. I was impressed with the great flavor and creamy texture of the actual cheesecake ( ).  On the outside, there was some curled up white chocolate morsels that added nice texture but not much flavor ( ). I was hoping they had that sweet white chocolate flavor but they did not. Nevertheless, a nice slice of cheesecake. My server was great. She had a friendly personality and was well verse in the in and outs of the the menu, especially their abundant of cheesecake offerings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=140,3.48,3.43,3.43,3.152,3.45

The menu is so big that there is something for everybody. From burgers to sandwiches to burritos to pasta to pizza to salads. Cheesecake Factory has you covered even for the real picky eaters. The place is usually packed with wait times of up to 15-20 minutes. Which isn't too bad. The key though is to go to the bar. If your lucky there is empty high table and bar stools. The bar is open seating. You don't have to put your name on the wait list. Just find an available high table or even sit at the bar. At the bar you can order anything off the menu. So that's what I did. While people were still waiting for a table. I just walked in. Sat at a high table at the bar. Got a beer and put in my order for food. Why wait to eat when you don't have to? I ordered the fried mac and cheese in a marinara sauce for my appetizer. It is so good. Crunchy on the outside and hot and cheesy in the inside. So addictive. Couldn't decide off hand on my main course but settled for the Kobe beef burger. Which I was glad I did. Having the burger cooked medium well with onions, mushrooms, melted swiss, tomato and lettuce. The burger wasn't complicated but just plain good. Washed it down with a pint of Karl Strauss Octoberfest. My meal was satisfying. The food was good. The service was friendly.

79,B. Ellen I.,"San Diego, CA",0,25,4.0,1.0,2015-04-17,"We came to this restaurant Thursday April 16th about 7:45pm. We walked in just ahead of a large party. We approached the host at the front (young Hispanic guy with a bow-tie) and were told a 15-20 min wait. He offered for us to sit immediately at the bar, but I hate bar benches and wanted to relax. We were given a buzzer and since it was crowded in the lobby, we sat ourselves outside on the bench. As we are leaving, I hear, ""we have a party of 6"" from the group after us. My husband sat on the bench with the buzzer directly next to him on the wooden seat and I got up to look at the menu. There is an open patio with approx 4-7 people in it with 2 different waiters attending to them. 10-min goes by...we are now sitting together on the bench talking, the buzzer directly between us on the wooden bench...15-min goes by...we are playing Candy Crush and Bookworm, respectively. I happen to glance up and there is a couple who is entering, the man with a walker...they go in and come directly out and sit...20-min goes by, I look up and I don't see anyone in the lobby so I get up to check and it's empty. I call my husband over and we go inside. We wait...I tell my husband, ""the party of 6 that came after us is already seated""...He goes up to the counter and talks to the same young, Hispanic guy with the bow-tie. My husband asks about our table. The bow-tie guy tells him, it's going to be 15 min. My husband says, we've been waiting for 20 min. The bow-tie guy tells him, ""it's only been about 4 minutes"". My husband says, ""no, we've been waiting for 20 min...here's our buzzer..it never went off"". The guy looks at it and immediately says, ""we rang it for 5 min and no one answered"".  He then said that he would put us at the top of the list. I'm watching this all transpire from the back of the lobby and my husband then tells me what went on. Since we still have to wait, I tell my husband ""forget it!"" As he walks up to tell the host we aren't going to wait, the couple with the walker is being escorted back to their table. When I was walking out of the door, my husband was giving the buzzer back and all the guy said was ""are you sure?""...SMH. I find this unacceptable. He basically lied and was in-turn, saying we were liars. I will SWEAR under OATH that the buzzer never went off (I mean, have you ever had a buzzer ANYWHERE that DID NOT keep buzzing and buzzing and was lit-up until it got your attention?!?! Besides, it was on a wooden bench...which would have amplified the buzzing to pure annoyance!). His response shouldn't have been that he had done his job and it was OUR FAULT we didn't hear the buzzer!!! He should have called to have us seated IMMEDIATELY! Anyhow, I was so fumed I told my husband there was no way that I could eat there being so upset. So we went to P.F. Changs.

There wasn't anyone waiting in the lobby and when the host team asked me how many in my party I said ""three and may we please sit at the tables in the happy hour area."" They directed me to seat myself and I walked over and waited at a 4 top table that needed to be cleaned. Finally after about 10+ minutes, I walked back up to the host station and asked if they could have someone come clean the table so we could sit. The male host said with an attitude ""Miss (which is incorrect--I am a ma'am) these people just came in and I am going to sit them there."" I then replied, ""I've been waiting here for over 15 minutes now for the table to be bused as per your instruction."" He said ""no miss...you requested to sit at the bar not at a table."" I then said, ""no, I requested to sit in the happy hour area at a table. I have two elementary aged children--I wouldn't ever sit at the bar!"" He replied very rudely and in an aggressive tone, (and when I mean aggressive...he stood up taller--which he was about 1 foot taller than me, tightened up every muscle in his face, took a step towards me, glared down at me while answering me in a scolding tone) ""No you requested to sit at the bar and now if you want to sit at a table, you are going to have to wait until everyone has been seated. And, as you can see, there is now a wait."" I turned to my kids who looked so confused and said ""Let's go."" My 9 year old son said ""why was he so mean to us? Why didn't he let us sit. He told us to go sit at the table and he pointed to the table when we walked in."" I just walked out and said ""we will find somewhere else to eat.""

363,Doug D.,"San Diego, CA",3,30,7.0,1.0,2015-06-27,Now I realize why this restaurant is not even four star. Kid Host Person unfriendly. No welcome or goodbye. But how does one teach etiquette to someone whose  highlight of the day is probably eating at McDonalds. Professionalism at the podium for the initial greeting is critical. Tables filthy along with spotted silverware and menus so dirty that one needs hand sanitizer after reviewing. My server today her first name starts with the letter M. Uniform in total disarray with disgusting stained white shirt and her hair looked like it hadn't been touched in a week. I was grossed out. Service throughout the meal...too many inconsistencies to even mention here. On this occasion food was very good but simple. Caesar salad and Cobb salad. I was so disappointed for the second time with the cleanliness and service of this place I had to call the manager Amy who's not the General Manager but I'm assuming his assistant. She took down all my concerns and was gracious. This may sound odd but she was the only highlight because she knew what I was talking about and agreed. I'm a former Food and Beverage Director in Las Vegas and San Diego and I give a lot of leeway when it comes to service as I understand things happen. But an unprofessional service staff...there is no excuse for it. Too much standing around when they can be polishing silverware and cleaning menus and training. This is a Manager problem as they must be hesitant to delegate  or instruct their staff for some reason.  I told Amy today I want nothing from this place but just to bring it to her attention. My experiences in Las Vegas with Cheesecake Factory in the Venetian and other places is five star. Maybe it's because of the Nevada Health Department takes things more seriously and it doesn't in San Diego which is probably too laid back. And if that's not the case then the service staff is definitely too laid back and I can sense they don't know or don't care about guest retention.  Bottom line profits at the Cheesecake Factory must be doing great because I don't know how Corporate allows mediocrity to continue.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=300,3.32,3.38,3.368,2.6920000000000006,3.3560000000000003

I used to work in food service, so I cut servers a lot of slack and I make sure to tip well because I'll always remember how hard it was to be a waitress. But I also give 3 strikes for bad customer service and our waitress definitely hit 3 strikes.  Strike 1: She didn't bring the bread, we were so caught up in our conversations, we didn't realize until hunger hit that we weren't given any bread. It came after the appetizers and after we asked. Strike 2: She never refilled our waters. When we had 4 out of 6 empty glasses, we finally asked whoever was nearby. Strike 3: She never came by to check on us, which is probably why strikes 1 and 2 happened. We couldn't find her most of the time, and when she was within our area she'd visit nearby tables but couldn't be bothered to check in with us. When she was nearby, we tried to get her attention, but she must've forgotten the fact that she was our waitress because she wouldn't even look in our direction. Drinks needed refills, plates were stacking up, and we needed boxes and the bill. Luckily, two other waiters helped out (Chandler was one, but I didn't catch the other one's name). Otherwise, I would've asked for the manager.

18,Ros A.,"University City, San Diego, CA",540,269,761.0,3.0,2015-08-21,"I do like the food at Cheesecake Factory. Service and wait times aren't that great. Came on a weekday evening with a party of 12.  Service: - Our server seemed nice, but since he had our table plus several other tables he would often forget things. There were a few things we had to ask for 2-3 times. And during the wait in between appetizer and dinner, he didn't check on us.  Waiting: - Once we ordered our entrees, it took over 40 mins for our food to come. Some restaurants give kids their food ahead of time, but not at Cheesecake. - My aunt doesn't like spicy food. She had ordered the fish tacos and asked if the salsa/sauce was spicy. The server said no. When her food came out, for her it was spicy. So we asked them to re-make it since the sauce/salsa was on all the tacos. Her food took about 10 mins to re-make. Some were already done eating. In my opionion, the server should have put it on the side just in case.  Food: - To start off, we had the calamari. These had a good crisp and was served with two different sauces.  -I ordered the Chicken Picatta. It had been years since the last time I had piccata. The chicken was moist and had the right amount if sauce. The portion was a good amount, so I had enough for lunch the following day. - I tried the Classic Burger. This too was good.

Went on a Sunday afternoon withy wife before the dinner rush so we were able to get a seat right away. Only problem I had with that was there were plenty of seats and the host just had to seat us directly next to another couple in the dining room... So my wife and I had about 20 minutes of awkward conversation until they finished and left. I'd have preferred some socially acceptable space so I didn't feel like I was eavesdropping on their conversation, or them on mine. Just weird and unappreciated. Food was good as usual though. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal; one minor thing I noticed, they did get a little cheap with the dipping sauces for our appetizer. We split an order of the buffalo meatballs, with there was hardly any sauce with it. Is dipping sauce really that expensive that they cut back on that now? Jeez! Anyway, my wife had the Chicken Madeira and I had the spicy crispy chicken sandwich. Both meals were very satisfying. And since it also happened to be my birthday, we also ordered dessert. I had vanilla cheesecake, my wife had lemon meringue cheesecake. Both were very good, after all it better be for their name sake! The only other feedback I have is the service could have been a little more attentive. I only had my drink refilled once and would have liked a third glass of coke zero but the server dropped off & retrieved the check without asking/noticing. I guess it was a good meal so I wasn't too disappointed.

Hubby and I came here to check the place out because next month we are treating a friend for her birthday and wanted to see if this would be a good place to go. We came here Sunday around 3:30 pm. Before we got seated, I used the restroom, and had to complain to the desk that the restroom needed attending to. It was filthy! I use a walker, and had to maneuver through paper towels that were strewn all over the floor Waited 10 min. for a table, was seated, waited another 20 min. to have our order taken, I asked for water ( I was informed that they don't serve straws with their water and was asked if I wanted one, I said Yes, and never got it. No biggie) I ordered a Grilled Chicken Avocado Club sandwich and sweet potato fries ($1 extra). Hubby ordered Roasted Turkey Sandwich and fries. We waited over 30 min. for our food. The place was pretty packed and all around us were tables of 4-13 people, so I knew it would be a wait. When our food finally came, my sandwich was cut in half, piled with thick cut tomatoes-3 halves on EACH half of sandwich! There was 1 tiny piece of HARD bacon on each sandwich, a smear of avocado, and a piece of cold chicken ,which had NO GRILL MARKS ( thought it was a ""GRILLED CHICKEN SANDWICH""?) and the meat on each was the size of a 50 cent piece! The sweet potato fries were barely warm, and tasted like they had been microwave re-heated, and the plate was scalding hot! Hubby said his fries were barely warm too. The only good thing was the cheesecake. We ordered the Hershey's cheesecake and split it. I didn't bother complaining because they were so busy, and we had already spent 2 hours there, and had had enough. I was really disappointed. Guess we will find somewhere else to take our friend to for her birthday.  :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=380,3.24,3.31,3.384,3.0120000000000005,3.282

Waited for another 10 mins for our drinks and we had to ask for bread. Once the waitress finally came to take our order which we had been ready for a while my friend asked for an appetizer to which she replied with "" oh I wouldn't order that it's going to take too long"" she then went on to tell us a story about how a previous guest had to wait about 40 mins which we were okay with but she was very pushy on us not ordering that. We then went on with our orders. When I asked for my option of course the restaurant ran out of turkey burgers. And then she showed me a list of all the items that were unavailable for whatever reason. I don't know if that's how this restaurant works but it is unacceptable in my book.

Ordered crab bites for starters; they were exactly that bights worth, true as stated in the menu;quality ingredients as best as I can tell. Entrees were good, however my other half's Carbonara was not as rich as other places, and my Fish and Chips was made of quality ingredients however the portion size was not nearly as large as what I've received elsewhere. Dessert was excellent, and super rich. What else would one expect with cheesecake being in the name. So good, that we couldn't finish because they were overwhelming in their denseness of flavor.

It's nice to get the same experience sans the fight for parking or the 30+ minute wait on a Friday night for a table for 4. Spent many a family lunch and dinner here when it first opened. The most recent visit the wifey and I rolled up at 5pm. No wait for a table for 4. The table location was a booth but we got neglected by our waitress for the first 25 minutes. I suspect we were the furthest table she took care of and it wasn't until she gave the table to another waitress that service improved. Complimentary bread was and still is amazing.  the white bread is sourdough - I think it's alright but never been a fan.  The dark wheat bread though - addicting. One of the few restaurants that does free bread so well. Especially when it's fresh baked and warm...yummy. Food is always delicious but a bit pricey. $11.50 for a plain hamburger and salad w/ balsamic dressing. That was off of their skinnylicious menu where all items were 590 calories or less. Lunch prices were in the same range with dinner hitting the $15-$25 range. I'll still be back occasionally. The bread and food is always solid but a bit pricey. Service is not perfect but still good, on other occasions it's been consistently better.

He gave us recommendations, as we asked from food to desserts, to drinks.  I had the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta & my boyfriend had the Chicken Madeira entree.  The spicy chipotle chicken pasta was made with a delicious red sauce and the server added Parmesan cheese, it was not super spicy, it was mild to average spicy. Nothing to sweat about.  My boyfriends chicken Madeira was delicious as well! The sauce was a little on the sweeter side, but it complimented very well.  For dessert we had the Tuxedo Cheesecake and it was really good! Ofcourse it was sweet, but it was perfect, lots of chocolate flavor.   Overall it was a great experience for me. Food and dessert was yummy and our server was very kind.

While the service was professional and efficient, my Chicken Madeira came out under cooked - chewy and the texture was all wrong. After I realized this I stopped eating the chicken (I had already consumed the first piece, which was fine), and informed our server. The manager came by and said sorry, offered another Chicken Madeira (no thanks, I'm getting some cheesecake). Mostly, I wanted them to know they undercooked the chicken so they can do a better job so no one got sick.

We did not have a reservation but arrived right when they opened. There was a 20 Minute wait because Our Large Party did not want to sit outside- smaller parties were seated in the bar area which does not feel like a bar. The wait, however, was well worth it.  Ambiance: Very Chill. I would definitely come here again for breakfast Service: The Service was on Point. The Server showed up within 3-5 Minutes of our seating introduced herself to us, took a drink order. Drinks were served promptly. We took our time ordering but did not feel rushed even though you could see people showing up in Droves. Once we ordered the Food was served Promptly with a minimal wait.

489,Tiffany J.,"Las Vegas, NV",228,121,39.0,2.0,2016-07-20,"I really don't like posting mediocre or even negative reviews. We must've come on an off night. I mean, it's Cheesecake Factory so there's an expectation of pretty decent but not inventive food. And an expectation of decent service as well.  Host stand: looked at my husband like he had 3 heads when we said we had 5 in our party.  We waited a few minutes for them to get a table ready. Followed her to the table, while passing 3 empty 6 top booths....to a booth for 4 where they put a chair at the end. Uncomfortable, but maybe they had cut the server in the section where tables that could actually seat 5 people were.  So they put an extra chair there but not another place setting. Also, our roll ups did not contain butter knives. So we were scraping our bread against the wrapper of the butter, and playing musical napkins. It was fun!   Service: server was in a hurry to get out. Barely spoke. Took our order and bounced.  The food runner dropped our apps down and left. No offer of ground black pepper for the Caesar salad. Maybe I overthought that one and CF isn't classy enough for that, but I swear I've been offered it before. Oh well, pepper shaker it was!  I should also mention that we were not offered share plates for the apps, so either we were using our tiny bread crumb covered plates, or eating directly from the plate itself. Good thing we were all family.  Food: chicken quesadilla was decent but guac was brown. Shirley temple was pink but had zero cherries. Caesar salad was okay but croutons were weirdly soft, like stale ciabatta bread that they didn't take time to toast. Carbonara was decent, but I find it strange that it was a white creamy sauce similar to Alfredo. Usually the carbonara I get at Italian restaurants doesn't have cream, or barely any, and the sauce is made with bacon grease/oil, pasta water and egg yolks. I could be wrong, or maybe this is just CF recipe.  The kicker:  the French dip. What a train wreck. I've never had a French dip that didn't come with, well, dip. Au jus. This was basically a roast beef sandwich on a hamburger bun. Yes, hamburger bun, complete with sesame seeds. Huh? I guess I was expecting a nice baguette and au jus to accompany. Again, maybe it's CF flair?  Well, it sucked. And the best part was, upon inspection, there were two corn kernels in it. If there was a bunch of corn in it, it would've made more sense. It would have been strange, but it wouldn't have creeped me out like two random corn kernels.  First world problems, yes. But when I'm spending $95 plus tip for dinner, I guess I expected a normal Cheesecake Factory experience. We still tipped $20 because we aren't a-holes, but seriously. Either this was a really off night, or it was the nonchalant B team working. They didn't even try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=80,3.88,3.45,3.404,2.8880000000000003,3.6220000000000003

164,Michael M.,"San Diego, CA",2,4,2.0,1.0,2016-08-12,"Came here for my uncles 30th bday and was shocked at how bad the environment was, how bad service was, and how bad the food was. Maybe my impression of the cheese cake factory was that it was a bit more upper scale but I guess I was wrong in that aspect. My bad. The noise and operations of the restaurant were so loud I had to yell to the person across the table from me just so they could hear. Most the time it just sounded like there were a bunch of dishes being cleared from tables and utensils falling on the floor.  We waited about 50 minutes to be seated which I was fine with. We didn't have reservations and it was prime time on Friday so I knew there would be a wait. The problem was that we were a group of 12 being served by 1 guy and it took 15 minutes to get our drinks and an hour and a half to get our food. Maybe I'm missing something here and that's average time for this size crowd. But the guy couldn't even get the right food in front of the right people. Why even write it down if you're not going to review your notes.  I had high expectations for the food because everyone seems to make a big deal about it. My mistake again. I ordered the chicken bellagio because the ingredients were boss level. It took the hour and a half to come out like I had mentioned before and I was upset at that. When it came out, it looked good and smelled good but it was like licking the ocean floor because it was so salty. It was more salty than this review. Then the waiter reassured me that it would take another 10 minutes to bring out another one. It took nearly 30 minutes and my whole family was already done eating. I tasted the food to make sure it was not salty and BAM!!! Good news. It tasted great. But by that time I lost my appetite and had them put it in a box for me to eat later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=160,3.68,3.45,3.412,2.724,3.5420000000000003

I chose Mexican on my most recent visit. The beans, rice, chicken, tortillas, green salsa and avocados were fresh and delicious. My daughter ordered Chicken Marsala, and my son ordered Shepard's Pie. They were also pleased with the quality. Our appetizers included fried macaroni and cheese balls. They literally melt in your mouth. Delicious! I like that they start your meal with complimentary warm bread and butter too. My favorite is the darker bread, that has oatmeal sprinkled over the top. It's a little on the sweet side, which satisfies my sweet tooth. The best part is the excellent cheesecake choices! We purchased a whole carrot cheesecake to eat at home. I got the 10 inch and was surprised when I found out how much it cost, which was about $52.00. Yikes! Next time I'll ask the price before ordering. It was so big, that the 7 inch would've been just fine. Regardless, it was very good.  The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5, is because of the noise level.

I ordered a California (avocado, onions, mushrooms tomatoes, garlic, cheese) omelet and coffee. I asked for spinach instead of mushrooms. I got a cheese and spinach omelet.... I asked the server for avacado since apparently it was forgotten. 15 minutes pass and I get a chunk of avacado. Seriously?? Subway would have given a bigger portion, let alone cut it up! I tell the server I'm upset regarding the amount of avacado. I get half of what was provided but in small little chunks the second time. The side of tomato I got was not even ripe.

I want to make sure he gets the best credit unfortunately I do not know his name but in speaking with him he loves his job there and he's a great employee!  I ordered the meatloaf because that's what I wanted to eat. not a problem if you have something that  happens and the last piece crumbles I understand. However everything I wanted with the meatloaf; like the sides is what what I wanted. So, the manager tells me there was a mishap and the meat basically disintegrated. That if I wanted to order something else. I told him not really I really want meat and nothing else. I then ask him if he could just throw a steak on the plate because I don't want to change the sides that it came with. The manager then tells me he cannot reinvent the menu because his name is not on the building. I tell him that's obvious but if there's an error way after I ordered my food that they should of came immediately and told me and not waited so long. Again I tell him just pick any steak and drop it in the middle cooked and we'll be done. He says he cannot do that that I have to pick a steak item from the menu. So then I say fine get me that ribeye steak. Well that steak is $27 he says. I don't care give me the $10 steak just put a piece of meat on my plate with the sides of the meatloaf.I don't understand why it's so hard for him especially after waiting so long to get my food which I didn't get. I pretty much will not be going back to this place and will continue to go to the number one cheesecake factory in fashion valley.

Everybody seemed happy with their orders. I ordered the avocado toast it was good. I was disappointed that they would serve it so burned on the bottom maybe since it was a to go order they though eh...they can't say anything about it. But I had to. I still ate it cuz I was hungry but each bite ended with that burnt taste. The 4 stars really is for the customer service I received on the phone and for having vegan options. Maybe consider a vegan cheesecake slice you can call it non dairy or whatever for your meat eating customers not to be afraid of it but it'd be a good idea. Honestly I haven't eaten here in like 2 years because of the options were limited. But it was a coworkers lunch so I'm glad I tried it again.

My hubby ordered the jambalaya which is his usual meal that he loves from there. Well we waited about 45min to get our food with a few apologies in between for the wait and they had served me the wrong salad! I had to wait an extra 5 to 10 min for them to correct it also my hubby's order didn't taste nearly as good as it usually does so at this point we were very disappointed!

My friends and I came here for our Friendsgiving. We were seated immediately upon arrival. SERVICE: Out of all The Cheesecake Factory locations I've been to, this one has the best service! All of our food came out within 20 min, which was surprising to me because I recall having to wait much longer than that at the Mission Valley and Downtown locations. And given that the restaurant was fairly busy at the time we were here, I thought that was impressive! Our waitress was very friendly, fun to talk to, and attentive! She recommended us some items on the cheesecake menu and would occasionally come by to refill our water and bread. She also came by to ask if we were satisfied with our food.  FOOD: I decided to try some menu items I haven't tried before. Here's what I tried: 1) Loaded tater tots: All hail the potato! Any foods with potato, I'm there. These loaded potato tots were amazing, especially with the sour cream and sriracha dip that came with it. I'm still thinking about these as I type. I'm tempted to order some for to-go tomorrow.  2) Chicken pasta: The pasta and marinara sauce ratio was spot on. The pasta was well done, and the marinara sauce was very tasty. The chicken pieces were a little dry, though.  3) Pumpkin cheesecake: I always expect nothing but good things when it comes to The Cheesecake Factory's cheesecakes.

Not sure why we planned a last minute birthday party here... we didn't think it would be packed at 2pm on a Sunday but it was. Consequently, it was noisy and hard to visit with tablemates. Based on yelp reviews we opted to order one of the popular dishes call bang bang chicken and shrimp. This was a miss for both of us as half the plate was rice and the meal was too sweet. Where was the spice? You couldn't even recognize any shrimp. Another miss was the garlic noodles with shrimp. We asked our waitress if the shrimp were supposed to look like they did...especially compared to another person's jumbo shrimp on angel hair (that was a hit). The waitress had to go get the manager who told me she didn't understand why on the garlic noodles they chopped the shrimp up here and there. Especially noticeable as it is priced higher than the angel hair with which has beautiful jumbo shrimp!  Am I being too picky to complain about this when the meal is 20 bucks? No, it's 20 bucks! That's not cheap. And I don't think these shrimp are the expensive ones from Mexico either...probably the $7 per pound from Indonesia. Niece enjoyed her eggplant parmesan. Mom enjoyed her veggie burger but not the bread that came with it. Nephew's pasta was tiny. Dad's burrito was huge but filled with a couple pounds of rice!

He may have just added water and reheated it in the microwaved.

Fastforwarding 20 minutes later, our food arrived, but the waiter didn't acknowledge us that the kitchen was running slow.  He didn't check on us if we needed anything else, didn't refill our beverages, didn't pick up at least one of our empty plates, and didn't tell us another waiter was going to take over.  I even over heard the other table behind me that the customer service was poor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=40,3.04,3.43,3.388,2.6000000000000005,3.274

Food - Steaks are great!!! but hibachi steak is too sweet. Thai wraps are bomb. If you're going to order cheesecake ensure that it's freshly made (baked) The one they gave us tasted like a week old Service - expect to wait after you sat down. Your waitress might be too tired to provide the proper service (after taking your drinks and appetizer order about 10-15min wait). After taking your order (main entre) 10-25min wait for main food to arrive (always forget steak knife).

We brought our clients to celebrate and reserved some of our comment to avoid our clients from feeling uncomfortable. Firstly, we transitioned between 5 servers within our first 10 minutes all while were confused and none could remember what we asked for. The following occurred during our dining experience my main frustration is my co worker and I split a LUAU salad which I requested with one of the 5 servers. The server that was on break came back with a full plate and I specifically asked the salad to be split into 2 bowls. The server proceeded to ""argue"" with me insisting this is against policy which is not true because another Cheesecake Factory graciously worked on this simple request of splitting a salad. Here is what else happened during our dining experience : 1) Rarely checked up on us several times my drink was empty and didn't ask if we could us refills 2) never offered hot water refills for our clients ""paid tea"" 3) Brought cheesecake with NO UTENSILS 4) We asked for more pumpernickel bread and it never came  5) We asked for straws and honey and no one came back with this simple request  6) Our dishes were not taken away when the cheesecake came out and clearly our plates were cleaned up and packed away. This by far has been one of the worst dining experiences to date since I've been living in the community since 2008. We dine our frequently and I now will choose to go to neighboring restaurants with better service.

483,Sakae G.,"San Diego, CA",6,42,47.0,2.0,2017-04-06,"Goodness, I really wonder why I keep coming back here, when I'm let down every time. Oh, right, I have a few gift cards I don't want to waste. I think I'll go up to the Fashion Valley location to finish those off, because the Eastlake one has some issues. They used to be good and I used to love coming here, but the quality is going down big time. This is going to be a long one.  Before I talk about tonight, here is a summary of the last three times I've come here: 1) Med-well Hibachi Steak I ordered came raw/under-rare in the middle. Was dining with a chef friend who warned me not to eat it when I showed it to her. Had to have it corrected. 2) A friend and I both got food poisoning from either the Factory Nachos or the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes that we shared. 3) My Herb-Crusted Salmon came raw in the middle; the middle was a darker orange and semi-transparent. I noticed it when I took a bite in the dim restaurant lighting and the salmon felt like mushy sashimi in my mouth, so I used my phone light to look at it and discovered the raw middle. Gordon Ramsey would have slapped his hand on that ""RAW!"" salmon and made it explode if any of his chefs tried to serve that. (Note: In cases 1 & 3 a manager had my meal remade, but something is wrong at the core here if they keep messing up like this) TONIGHT: I'll try to keep this brief-ish: Fried Mac&Cheese appetizer was refrigerator cold in the middle of one of the balls, and the other 3 were just barely warm. The only tasty part of them was the breadcrumb crust and the marinara sauce they were served on top of. My entree--Hibachi Steak med-well again--was thankfully served med. But the potatoes were cold and the ""tempura asparagus"" was just the 1.5"" chunks of fried stalk and a few chunks of empty fried batter. My dining companion ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, and guess what? You'll never guess. Ready? It was cold too! The shrimp was cooked to the point of being little rubber discs, the rice was hard and cold as if it had sat out for hours before being put on her plate in a cup-shaped flat-topped mound. She said the black beans tasted like they'd been poured straight out of a can onto her plate. But! The 3 plantain slices that came on with her meal were great and hot and we ate those dipped in the black pepper sauce, which was spicy and tasty as well. A little on the sweet side, but still good. I had a few bites of the Banana Cream Cheesecake I got to take home, and that was really good! (But I'm pretty sure that wasn't made here and was shipped in) For this much money ($75 tonight) I expect my food to be hot, fully cooked, and taste good. This Cheesecake Factory location keeps failing on all three counts. Also: Restrooms were dirty with tp in only 2 of 5 stalls, and the menus and salt/pepper shakers were coated in food smears and grime.

It's a sit-down place right by Barnes and Noble. You park in the mall parking lot and, if you're just walking in and depending on the time of day, can meet a wait time of anywhere from fifteen minutes to over an hour. The attire is pretty flexible; you can come dressy for an event or casual for lunch. The restaurant also accommodates group parties, although usually in a group event we've been seated outside. The food is usually somewhere between $12-$30 depending on what you order, and the wait staff are always really nice. Portions are generous. You get free bread and butter to tie you over before your entree comes out, and it's always a warm and welcome addition to your meal. The food itself can be a hit or miss because of the broad range of dishes they offer. I really like their salmon, broccoli and mashed potatoes dish, so if you're into fish I suggest you give it a try. For an appetizer, definitely try the tex mex eggrolls. As for seating, you can either sit at a booth/table inside or a table outside. The noise level is average (conversations around but not to the point that you can't hear yourself speak) and the seating is pretty intimate; the booths have high backs so you're pretty much in your own space. The cheesecake is also really good.

We ordered the egg roll sampler as an appetizer and it was actually pretty good. It came with 4 types of egg rolls and 4 dipping sauces, see picture below. My favorite one was the pork! For my entree I ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes since I was craving something sweet and was also looking for something packed with carbs to give me energy for the gym later lol. I'd say these were probably the fluffiest pancakes I've ever had. They came topped with sliced strawberries and a sprinkle of powdered sugar. My only complaint would be that it wasn't lemony enough. There was lemon zest on top but it definitely wasn't enough for me to taste in any bite. Might as well have been called Strawberry Ricotta Pancakes haha.  Our waitress was incredible, very nice and accommodating. She always made sure we had everything we needed, along with each of the other employees that dropped off food at our table.  I guess based off of everyone else's reviews, this location is a hit or miss. I do personally recommend though, given that their menu is insanely extensive so there will definitely be something for every palate. Good for any occasion, special or casual!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2,3.08,3.34,3.344,3.184,3.2360000000000007

I dine here 3 to 4 times a year and usually order my favorite Louisiana Chicken Pasta. This time I tried something different.  . I was amazed at the infusion of flavors this dish splashed my taste buds with. From eating through the piping hot chicken chunks then the mildly spicy coconut curry sauce and mushrooms and onions and ending with the chilled mango chunks in every bite, its hot, mildly-spicy, cold mixture provided a delightful foodgasmic experience. My mind was never this busy tasting each ingredient this dish had in every bite.  . I highly recommend this dish. Update: 7/22/2017 I ordered this dish last Wednesday. They added cashew nuts and the mango cubes were not served chilled.

After taking our pager our party of 9 was left standing at the front. Some blonde lady in pink, didn't say who she was or if she was a shift lead or manager or whatever told us that they were ""just checking in"" with us and that there was no way to know how long it would take for the people at the table to get up and leave. She said it would be rude of her to tell those patrons to leave but then in the same breath told me that my toddler could be fussy and would probably be better off waiting at Barnes at Noble until the table was ready. Do the pagers even extend that far? I think they did tell the patrons to leave though because a huge party walked out and none of them looked happy at all.  We were hungry and we're ready to put in our main order with the appetizer but our server insisted that he would take that order later. While waiting for our mains to come my mom finds a huge fly sitting in the bottom of her sweet tea! They brought us a new tea and that same blonde in pink came over and asked us how we were doing, didn't apologize or acknowledge the fly or anything!!! We asked the waiter if he had told his manager and he said he did but she didn't say a word about it.  Also my fiancé ordered a medium rare burger and they served him medium well. This has happened every time we come here and I don't see the point in asking customers if they're just going to cook it however they want.

Their employees are friendly, the food is great, wait times are reasonable, and it's the perfect place for all types of occasions. However, I was really turned off today by their dirty utensils. My family and I came for Sunday brunch at around 11 a.m. and only waited about 15 minutes, which is really great for brunch. When our hostess brought us to our table, it had yet been cleaned nor set. We had to wait another 10 minutes until we were seated. We easily excused that small fumble as our hostess was very friendly and had a great sense of urgency. She apologized to us and even helped clean the table herself.  Before we shuffled into our booth, we noticed that the seats were not entirely cleaned off. There was left some sort of grease stain that we had to awkwardly bring notice to to an employee. Not only were the seats still dirty, but so were our utensils. I first noticed a brown smudge on my fork that I honestly was just going to wipe off with my napkin, but then I noticed that all of our utensils on the table had crusted food on it. We then had to, again, awkwardly tell an employee that they gave us dirty utensils.  The second round of utensils they brought out to us were definitely cleaner than the first, but they still had unsightly white marks on them. We didn't complain, we just decided to wipe them ourselves. Fortunately, not long after, another person came by and brought us very clean utensils that were shiny and warm, probably freshly cleaned. We were pleased with their helpfulness but the switching of utensils twice got very annoying.  As always, Cheesecake Factory is a fine place. I most likely will continue to eat here. I just really hope something is done about their dirty dishes. It can easily turn someone off to this restaurant. Not gonna lie, we were contemplating on going to another restaurant because of it.

The host/hostesses were very polite, easy to talk to, and extremely attentive. The ambience is very nice, it gives you a more fancy type of feel, but in a family setting. I went in the middle of the afternoon on a work day, so the place was pretty empty. That being said, you would think it would be nice and clean. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. The host sat us down in the booths in the back where the dome is. Every table around us has dirty dishes and FLIES. There were flies everywhere! Only reason I stayed was because my friend date was really craving the BangBang dish.  Our waiter didn't tend to us until 5 minutes after we got sat. Now, I work in restaurants - as a server, hostess, and manager. In every restaurant I worked, and even this location (my friends work here), you are supposed to stick to the 30 second rule. You have 30 seconds to tend to your table after they got sat to run them any drinks so they can drink while they browse the menu. Our waiter, instead, was hanging around the bar talking to his co-workers. When he finally came up to us, we said we were still browsing then he said ""alright then."" And walked away. He didn't take the time to get our drink orders (and we just wanted water), nor did he wait to answer my question. We had to wave him down for him to return. When he did, we asked for our waters and I asked if he could see if the kitchen could substitute my rice for quinoa. He told me he would check, but he did it with a slight attitude.  He came back about 10 minutes later with our waters, one was supposed to be with lemon, the other without. Just shows he wasn't paying attention... He tells me that he would be able to substitute, but for an up-charge. I said that was fine. We ordered two BangBangs, mine was supposed to be substituted with quinoa. When it came out, it was just brown rice. Instead of complaining, since the food was already made, I just told him I would keep it, but to not charge me for it. That was the last time I saw our waiter our entire visit. Ran out of water, no refills. I had to get up and ask, then get up again and ask for the box and check. I gave a $2 tip. I felt rude, but at least I gave something for the poor service (because I do understand that some places require you to tip out bussers, and I know he wasn't going to do any cleaning...)

120,Amanda B.,"National City, CA",0,5,1.0,2.0,2017-08-19,"So I usually love the Cheesecake Factory. It's fun and upbeat and the food is always great. However, I'm at dinner with my gf. Who keep in mind is younger than me. I'm 30 yrs old. When I showed the bartender that I only had my paperwork from the DMV and a picture of my old license, she denied me a drink. Even asking her manager if they would accept it in place of my picture ID. She was so consumed with arguing the fact if i was really my age that she never bothered to look at my friends drivers license. She asked but never looked at it. So this to me is unacceptable. You are sure that you cannot serve me a glass of wine but you serve my younger partner a drink without ever glancing at her ID..? To top it off, after telling me she could not serve me and it was against the law, she adds the favorable comment, ""oh well DD it is."" WHO SAYS THAT TO AN UNSATISFIED who customer?!?! Incompetence at its finest. Understandable she couldn't serve me, just doing her job. But is rubbing it in also in her job description?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=120,3.48,3.25,3.344,2.536,3.342

467,Christina H.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,2.0,1.0,2017-08-26,"We go to cheesecake because everything is always pretty consistent no matter which location.  Not the case for us last night. We waited over 45 minutes for any food to arrive at the table. The server said the kitchen ""lost the ticket"" the manager said the kitchen was ""backed up"". I'm sure the server just forgot to put the order in as all other tables around us who sat after us received their meals. I've been restaurant trainer and manager for over 10 years, so I know what that looks and sounds like. What was worse, the manager didn't even apologize he came up to say he was aware the food was taking long and offered us a calamari that had completely died under the line. I know because I saw a runner try to serve it 25 minutes earlier. The sauces, the plate and the lemon wedge were extremely hot... really nice gesture send out old food that was dead anyway to a couple with a 10 month old who have now been seated an hour without food. The sever completely ignored us instead of being more present and apologizing. We didn't need to be lied to, just acknowledged that our meal was ruined.  Just to put it into perspective how ignored our sever left us, he was taking an order next to us when we just decided to box the food since it still hadn't arrived. We agreed just to leave if he turned the other direction instead of coming up to as. And we did because he went out of his way to avoid us.  I've never ever ever left a restaurant like that before. In fact, I don't eve yelp other restaurants because I'm in the industry and I prefer to email or call but this situation left me so angry, starved for food and actual hospitality I do feel compelled to warn others.  We went to in and out and enjoyed the service and the food much better. That's my suggestion to others want consistency and hospitality!  Will not return to any location after this. We have options when it comes to dining out... money should be spent on places that care.  Last piece, the other manager was so completely unaware of our situation that she actually thanked us on the way out!! Clueless. Please retrain your team.

We were quoted a 25 min wait and given a pager. We requested outdoor seating since if it was available first and noticed no one was being seated outdoors anymore. I had my teenage daughter go to check in and let the staff know we'll take any available seat. My daughter comes back to tell my husband that they had paged us and called out name. That was a flat out lie. My husband was livid and said the pager didn't go off. We were also sitting outside and our names weren't called either. I went back inside to tell the staff what my daughter told us and they said we'd be seated right away. After 5 min of waiting we were finally seated. When it was my turn to place my order, the server mentioned that they didn't have that dish available. She hands me a paper that listed the unavailable dishes... I swear there was about 20 of them! I told the server to take my husband and daughter's order and to come back for mine. When she comes back, I choose another dish. That was also unavailable too. I was starting to get frustrated. She just explained that the restaurant underestimated how busy it was.  If a restaurant knows IN ADVANCE that more than 10 dishes are unavailable, this should be announced at the time of checking in. Customers should know in advance the menu is limited, especially for the popular items.  If that were the case, my family would've left at eaten elsewhere. My husband wanted to get up and leave, but we already waited 30 minutes and were seated. Not very happy with tonight's dining experience.

Anyways I ordered the barbecue ranch chicken salad lunch portion and my mom got the pasta carbonara lunch size also. You can't really go wrong with salad so I enjoyed mine although I do wish it had more dressing. But the pasta she got was way too salty. We didn't even bother to ask our server for a new one because that would have taken another 5 years. It's a good thing I ordered the salad though to even out the saltiness.

After waiting a while, we asked our server how much longer before we get the appetizers. She went to check with the kitchen, and came back to tell us that she forgot to order out appetizers. She then asked if we still want our appetizers because our food is almost ready. So I told her to forget. Our food took another 20 minutes to be served.

Gave him immediately our kids order and drink order and appetizer order. I had also asked for waters but after three different table touches (each time he would bring out different drinks instead of prioritizing and bringing everything together we would have rather waited a little longer then two drinks here then a few minutes later another drink and then the waters after that). About 15 go by we receive our kids food,  with no sign of the appetizer we ordered at the same time. Probably 20-25 minutes in he comes by and says our food will be out shortly and we ask to cancel the appetizer since it's been over 30 minutes. What's the point of asking for a starter if it comes with the meal especially since we ordered it 15 minutes before we ordered our meal. Ten more minutes go by, we get our meals and I had noticed the chicken was dressed in vinegrette when I asked for no vinegrette, but they were good. But server didn't do a check back and only brought our stuff because the hostess couldn't get a to go box.

It was perfect the way it was!  Parking here was a hassle, but good thing we got there earlier than usual. I love the area that it is in. There's definitely places to see/ just walk off that big meal that you just ate!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2,3.04,3.08,3.284,,3.0640000000000005

I tell him that I asked for spicy chicken nachos and he says oh you may have said that but I recall you said factory nachos?! Are you kidding me? Why the hell would I pay for some damn tortilla chips with cheese?! He needs to learn customer service skills and learn to give the customer what they asked for!!!!

141,Lindsey B.,"Chula Vista, CA",12,119,109.0,1.0,2017-12-17,"Came to TCF for lunch on a Sunday. We were seated on the patio and placed our order of Kids pasta with butter, chicken and biscuits, and chicken and waffles from the brunch menu.  We waited over an hour before receiving the two meals pictured. Both had spent an extended period of time under the heat lamps. The plates were too hot to touch. There was no butter left to be seen on the hard Kids pasta. The gravy of the chicken and biscuits had created a thick film across the food and had burned onto the vegetables. My husband never received his food at all.  I asked to speak to a manager and after ten minutes he came to the table to say he was sorry for the delay in my husband's food. That they ran out of poached eggs but would have more in 2 minutes. I showed him our food and stated we were not comfortable eating that and quite honestly we weren't interested in a remake. I asked him ""Would you eat this?"" And he responded that no he wouldn't nor would he feed it to his family. Yet it was served to mine.  Very disappointed. Very surprised the only option he gave us was to wait for a remake of food that we had already waited an hour for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2,2.84,3.06,3.264,,2.9720000000000004

There were urine spots on some of toilet sheets.  It made me sick to my stomach.  Who wants to go to a dirty bathroom before you eat??  I believe it's the manager to be blamed. The employees should always go check the bathroom and keep it clean.  Food was terrible!  I ordered seafood pasta plate. It was so greasy. My husband had a Big burrito and it was full of white rice inside, covered with a big tortilla.   The manager's name is Betty Coronado.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2,3.04,3.13,3.284,,3.094

Waitress told me it was on the same baguette style that is served as complementary. That was not what I expected. She said she explained it because most don't want she tells them. I then ordered grilled artichoke. No artichokes. I then ordered flatbread and mushroom soup. I was asked if I liked mushroom soup, I said, ""yes"".  I was offered a taste to make sure I liked it...strange but OK. Good thing, it was horrible, strangely sweet. Flatbread was OK not great. Worst meal I have had there. Service was great!!! Left a 40% tip.  They also discontinued the kahlua cheesecake. Got a tiramisu on the way out.
