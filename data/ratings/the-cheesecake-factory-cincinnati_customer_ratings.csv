191,Stephen G.,"Cincinnati, OH",22,128,,2.0,2012-03-22,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of those restaurants where the phrase ""Your Mileage May Vary"" (YMMV) was made for. Every half-good experience we have ever had there has been tempered by the very next visit where we have often vowed to never darken their proverbial doorstep again. I think the reason we DO go back is that TCF at the Kenwood Town Center is - apart from the tacky ill-designed food court - pretty much the 'only game in town', its prime location at the main entrance to the mall guaranteeing it eyeballs and footfalls. The food isn't the problem. Sorry, I'll rephrase that... the food is rarely the problem. The menu is massive - the kitchen's cooks must hate its size and choice - and you can often get through one entire drink deciding what entree to opt for. (Is this the perfect sales ploy I wonder?). Almost everything that comes out is averagely average and inoffensively bland, but the restaurant always scores for the size of its portion. HUGE! When perusing the menu always try and bear in mind that your leftovers and subsequent doggy bag will feed you - for at least - one day extra. It's often like 2 or 3 meals for the (high) price of one! Once in a while however, something comes to your table that both looks and tastes awful... like the Teriyaki Chicken I tried there last year which had the look of something that had been kicked around on the floor before being plated. To be fair - food wise -  that was a bit of an anomaly. However, The Cheesecake Factory's main turnoff - for us is most definitely the service. I don't mean the people at the front desk who are trying to accommodate everyone who walks in expecting and/or demanding an immediate table for 4, but the servers. This, my friends, is where everything that could be good about the place gets ruined in one foul swoop. Don't get me wrong, we have had good service there. More often than not though we've been forced to encounter whatever the word is for 'indifference meets attitude'. On our most recent visit you could almost see the glow of boredom around the girl who phonily claimed she would ""be looking after us"". I respect that this is something of a ""first world problem"" but it then took an age for her to get waters to our table and our subsequent request for straws to drink them with was met with an almost audible *sigh*. I also have issues with servers who are initially keen to ask you what you would like then point blank refuse to listen to your response because, presumably, their heads are off on some cloud somewhere. My wife had to repeat her choice twice whilst I had to chime in three times before she comprehended mine. When the food eventually came she did wander over to ensure everything was okay. My wife asked for her water to be refilled and off the girl went for the jug. She came back, filled my wife's glass... totally missing the fact that, by this time, mine was also empty. My wife and I just looked at one another and laughed... laughter which became a little sour when we didn't see the server again for the rest of the meal. Oh sure she came to the table next to ours to deliver a check and pick up the payment but she never, ever returned to us again until such time as she was due to get paid. This, sadly, was not a rare experience. We have sat in all areas of the vast indoor space the Cheesecake Factory takes up and I would say that 8 times out of 10 we have received the same level of disappointing service, almost as if the staff there are trained in 'the art of surly'. Maybe that's why the portions are so big so as to take your mind off the service? Personally I think I'd prefer smaller portions, lower prices and a guarantee of some quality manners and attention from the staff. Now, on this most recent visit we didn't visit the bathrooms. There is very good reason for this. Maybe they have fixed the problem but on every visit in the past three or four years the bathrooms - and the corridor that leads to them - has permeated an off-putting odor. Not necessarily of lingering wee or poo but most definitely something with a 'sewerish aroma'. We commented on this once to a member of staff who could hardly wait to walk away from us after mumbling ""it's like that most of the time"" in our general direction. Now, before I tar the whole Cheesecake Factory chain with the same critical brush let me just say that our 'problems' have been limited exclusively to the Kenwood location. On our frequent visits to Chicago we have thoroughly enjoyed - and indeed, raved about - their location at the base of the Hancock Tower. We've never received anything but exemplary service there and can't make any complaints at all. Kenwood, by comparison, is the merest shadowiest shadow in Chicago's wake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cincinnati?start=160,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.6960000000000006,3.5200000000000005
203,Manu M.,"Cincinnati, OH",16,111,8.0,3.0,2012-04-03,"This restaurant is in a prime location in the Kenwood Mall. Another one of my co-workers favorites (I think it's because of the low-cal or veggie options).  I have been here twice already. I go here because my friends like it, I like their company, and I don't mind the food. Nothing to write home about, but okay.  They have a skinnylicious menu which is supposedly low calories and all that jazz. I like a little bit of flavor in my food. If it is the bland microwaved dish, you can keep it to yourself. First time I went here, I made the mistake of ordering the Pasta. It was a sacrilege to the memory of the Pasta Carbonara I had from Yayas, Denver. They had all the stuff there - white sauce, green peas, bacon... but none of the flavor.  Next time I went, I was mindful of my lesson and ordered Jamaican Black Pepper shrimp. I have had a good experience with this dish in another location. And bang! They delivered it with the correct flavor.   Service is a good thing here, they are mindful of you, are fast. But don't take any recommendations from them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cincinnati?start=160,3.44,3.44,3.44,2.8280000000000003,3.4400000000000004

56,Amanda C.,"Cincinnati, OH",53,221,192.0,3.0,2012-05-11,"It seems like the Kenwood Cheesecake Factory has deteriorated in the last few years. I used to really love the food here, but my last experience was disappointing. The Thai chicken pasta was so bland that I sent it back, and the sliders I ordered in its place weren't much better. As always, the cheesecake was stellar, so I would suggest the Cheesecake Factory more as a dessert stop than a dinner option. Not relevant to this review, I find the Cheesecake Factory's promotional emails incredibly self-serving and unfriendly. The ""specials"" are distinctly un-special, so I can't recommend anyone sign up for the mailing list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cincinnati?start=120,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.8280000000000003,3.4000000000000004
225,Amanda M.,"Alexandria, VA",166,200,902.0,4.0,2012-05-16,"I'm giving this Cheesecake Factory 4 stars - 3 stars for the food but 5 stars for our server Mason. A group of 7 of us stopped in here for a late lunch on Saturday (5/5). We only had to wait about 10 minutes and then we were escorted to a large round booth. Between the 7 of us, 4 were running the Flying Pig Marathon the next day and 3 were running the Half Marathon so we needed to carb load. As with all CFs I have eaten at, the food is a solid 3 star, nothing spectacular (I don't think it is possible to have outstanding food with a menu as large as CF's) but nothing bad either. This location gets 4 stars because we truly had 5 star service from Mason.  I'm not kidding when I say that between 7 of us we ordered water 4 different ways - water with ice and lemon, water without ice or lemon, water without ice but with lemon and water with ice but no lemon - poor guy, I wouldn't have blamed him if he had run away. We demolished the bread baskets and when we asked for more of the brown bread (which also deserves 5 stars) Mason brought us three baskets full (and we ate it all). One of the main dishes was not done when the other six were served, Mason apologized profusely and his manager came over and did the same. The seventh main came out within 5 minutes and we all dug in. When it came time to settle the check, Mason asked how we wanted to split it. We asked if we could split it seven ways. Mason responded with a smile and said ""sure, that will be easy."" We all reacted with shocked expressions and told him that that was the first time we have ever had a server respond that way. Mason explained that since our orders were put in by table and seat number, he could just print off the check for each seat number.    For me personally the serving sizes at CF are way too big, I ate until I was stuffed and still left with a takeout box full of enough pasta for an entire meal. In fact 4 of us took half of our meals home. Since we were staying in a motel we asked for plastic forks. In addition to the silverware, Mason also brought each of us some more brown bread wrapped in foil. Maybe it is because all of us are used to the attitudes that pass for customer service in the DMV area, but we were all so thrilled with the service we received from Mason that we asked to speak with his manager. We all complimented him profusely and his manager explained that Mason had just recently started picking up shifts on the floor (he normally works behind the counter in the bakery). So, if you are in Cincinnati and find yourself at this CF location, request Mason as your server, you won't be disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cincinnati?start=180,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.8640000000000003,3.4000000000000004
209,Nikki H.,"Austin, TX",4,20,10.0,4.0,2012-05-21,"We came to this restaurant with no clue what to expect. We had never gone to a Cheesecake Factory restaurant before. We went in around 4pm, which was great because it was so empty around the bar area and had few people seated in the booths.  We had a great waiter. He was full of energy and got our orders correct. He refilled our drinks frequently...so frequently that we had to tell him we didn't need one at the moment a couple of times. We ordered the nachos appetizer, Shepherd's pie, salmon/mashed potatoes, The Club sandwich and Baja chicken tacos. They all looked great and the portions were huge. I can't say how the other meals tasted like but the Baja tacos were flavorful, spicy, and perfectly accented with cilantro. We ended up bringing most of our food and the cheesecakes home. I had the low carb cheesecake with fresh strawberries on top, it was excellent.  The only con about the whole experience was the fact that the windows where we sat by were right next to the entrance to Kenwood Mall so it was a bit distracting with people walking by or sitting right under our window in benches.  Word of advice: be prepared to come in very hungry or bring home food since the portions are huge and this isn't a budget-friendly place to eat at.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cincinnati?start=180,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.8320000000000003,3.4000000000000004

79,Jeni S.,"Cincinnati, OH",23,25,7.0,2.0,2012-06-21,"I have been to the Kenwood Cheesecake Factory more times than I can count. If I am ever at the mall with my mom and sister, The Cheesecake Factory has always been the spot we stop for lunch or dinner. Mostly, we go here because it is convenient and has a lot of menu items. Since we all have different tastes, this place is a good compromise since everyone will find something on their massive menu that they like.  I have to say though, after my recent visit, I will never go back. Our server was nowhere to be found our entire meal. She took our drink order and didn't come back until she gave us our check. Anything we needed (refills of water, salt and pepper, napkins- you know- basics), we had to grab a server at another table or someone passing our table running food to another.  I have experienced its progressive decline over the past year or so. Each time, it gets a little bit worse. The food quality has gone steadily downhill, the service is terrible anymore and the prices seem to be going up. I am not sure whether they actually are, or it's that the terrible service and mediocre food simply highlight the fact that you're paying a whole lot of $$ that could be much better spent elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cincinnati?start=140,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.7280000000000006,3.2800000000000002
190,Melissa M.,"Lexington, KY",168,169,37.0,5.0,2012-06-22,"The first time I ever went to a Cheesecake Factory, I almost peed my pants I was so excited. The mere idea that a place exists with 20 kinds of cheesecake thrilled me beyond measure. When I found out they were building one in Cincinnati, I googled its opening for months. Today, we stopped by for lunch. We were seated in less than 5 minutes. It takes me a long time to choose from the menu because there are so many items from which to choose . This place really appeals to the hedonist in me. I also love the decor. I always feel like I'm enveloped in some kind of amber marshmallow cloud. We decided to choose from the lunch options because the other options are always huge.  The lunch options are also gigantic. I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and salad (lunch portion). I could have fed an entire family with it. It was the best BBQ chicken pizza. The sauce was sweet and delicious with the red onions. The cheese was melty and wonderful. My fiance had the Chipotle Chicken Pasta. I tried it. It was very tasty - and enough to feed about 5 people. So, we had to get boxes. For dessert, we shared Adam's Peanut Butter Ripple Cheesecake. It has huge chunks of Butterfingers in it, peanut butter drizzled in the cheesecake and a chocolate crust. I think my fiance was a little upset watching me with the cheesecake as I seemed to be having some type of illicit affair with it.  It may be a chain but mmmm....heaven.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cincinnati?start=160,3.4,3.4,3.4,3.0920000000000005,3.4000000000000004

My sister and I came here for dinner around 6:30 and we were quickly seated at a table facing the bar. Our waiter was quick and friendly, even though it took me forever to pick something off the menu! After we ordered, warm bread and butter was brought to our table, I always appreciate warm bread! =)  We ended up ordering the firecracker salmon for an appetizer, shrimp scampi and grilled pork chops. All of which were good choices. The firecracker salmon was similar to a spring roll, but with cooked salmon and spinach. It was tangy and pretty good, but I like my salmon raw rather than cooked. My shrimp scampi was delicious; I actually cleaned my plate, which rarely happens! The shrimp was fresh and flavorful. The angel hair was cooked to the perfect texture, which went well with the buttery wine sauce. I didn't try the pork chops, but they looked good. I tried the mash and the apple sauce that came with it, I would eat that all day if you'd let me, haha.  We were stuffed, but as our waiter cleared the table, I answered him eagerly when he asked us if we wanted the dessert menu. In my head I was thinking, I've only been waiting all night!

I just got home from taking my daughter out for a ""date night"".  She likes looking at the Disney Store (review to follow) and other children themed places at Kenwood Towne Center, so I thought that going to Chessecake would be a good choice. The place is ALWAYS crowded, and I'm used to waiting to get in there, but tonight was even longer than usual...about a 2 hour wait.  I ordered the Wasabi-Crusted Ahi Tuna Steak with Black rice (my daughter ordered the Mac & Cheese). The first thing that was disappointing about the service was that my meal was served with brown rice, instead of the black that I ordered...Next, all of items on the plate (the tuna, rice and julienne vegetables) were EXTREMELY bland.  The wasabi crusting that was detailed on the menu was more like a bland mound of panko bread crumbs scooped on top of my unevenly cooked piece of fish.  For $30 and being one of the most expensive dishes on the menu, you'd think that a little more pride and attention to detail would go into preparing it.  I had to douse my entire plate with soy sauce (which I had to ask for) to get through my meal...it's such a shame because it really did look like a quality cut of fish.

That's all I could think about and it's the only thing I wanted, so imagine how disappointed i was to find out that AFTER I had ordered my food, they were out of salmon. Seriously?! Completely out. And apparently had been out for three days. (Because telling me that when we sat down would have been too easy. Had we known they were out of salmon, there's no way I would have even ordered a glass of water.) The seating is ridiculous and I must say, if you're going to stick me at a table for ""two"" that is directly next to another table so that I feel like I am involved in their conversation, that's not a pleasant dining experience for me. That's more like torture.  The meal I ordered in substitution for my favorite meal being out of stock was the curry chicken and shrimp- recommended by our waiter. This thing was gross. It was grey in color and resembled cat vomit. I tried to eat the rice a handful of times and that was it for me- I couldn't finish this $15 plate of nasty. The wait times for this place are outrageous. 2 hours for a table for two?! Are you kidding me!? Save your money and hassle and go somewhere else. The only thing I can recommend is to get a slice of cheesecake to go and eat it at home where you don't have to listen to the empty nesters in the seat next to you crying because they moved their kid into college that morning.

197,Kristin C.,"Cincinnati, OH",87,30,2.0,5.0,2012-08-18,"I like The Cheesecake Factory. As far as large chain restaurants, it's by far my favorite.  The overall ambience of the place is just great. The dim lighting, the decor. I instantly feel relaxed. The servers are always really professional and friendly- they educate you on whatever menu changes there are and  offer great recommendations.  My favorite (non alcoholic) drink is definitely the raspberry lemonade. The rim of the glass is covered in sugar and it's just absolutely delicious. I order it every time I go.  One thing I really like about The Cheesecake Factory is the huge menu selection. There's literally something for everyone. Vegetarian, Asian, Italian... You name it, they've got it. They even have an entire ""Skinny"" menu for those who are watching what they eat.  The cheesecake... How could I not mention that? Unfortunately I'm so boring, my favorite is the plan old Original Low Carb cheesecake. The White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut cheesecake is amazing but I usually can't handle all of that.   It's not inexpensive, that's for sure. But, I believe you get what you pay for.

The menu is overwhelming, so let me just help you out here. Get the lettuce wraps. Everything else is a fine, but mostly uninteresting. The lettuce wraps are very good, and also very large. Get the lettuce wraps and share it with someone for two reasons:  1. There is no way that you will be able to eat all of anything on the menu. The portions are more than generous, they are ridiculous.  2. Nothing is cheap. However, if you take the price of the lettuce wraps and divide by two, you are getting somewhere. Service is hit or miss. Good luck. Now it's time for dessert, and this is important. Pay your server, leave the restaurant, and go to Maggiano's next door for cheesecake. Cheesecake factory gets all their cheesecake frozen in a big truck every couple weeks. Maggiano's makes their cheesecake from scratch every morning and it's amazing.

I have had slices of cheesecake and even a light bite from the appetizer menu to-go, but on this occassion I dined in with some friends.  We could not make a reservation because we called one minute--ONE MINUTE-- past the time they stopped taking reservations (I didn't even know they had a cut-off time for reservations).  We wound up waiting for about 30 minutes because one of my friends arrived early and got the wait started. The food was okay.  I say okay because across the board it was inconsistent.  We ordered a couple of appetizers to share with the table and one order of stuffed mushrooms was piping hot and the other was lukewarm.  The entree I ordered was okay, but there was definitely no seasoning, which was disappointing.

If going at a popular hour, I'd recommend a reservation. We've also shown up later in the evening and immediately gotten a table. I also recommend sharing because honestly, who can finish these portions? Issues mainly revolve around the fact that it's hard to choose from a menu that is simply way too big. Also, we really find that all the flavors of cheesecake are too sweet. I mean, I want to order something different, but in the end, I always go with the original because I find all other flavors to be too sweet. I can't finish a slice by myself, that's for sure.

I am convinced that at least this location has no regard for their customer's experience but I am going to share the experience with anyone else who might be considering dining at this location. If they would have taken the time to discuss and address the situation I would have considered keeping this to myself but I feel it necessary to share. Below is a verbatim of my unaddressed experience that I've shared with CF via Facebook and their website:  Yesterday's experience in your restaurant bordered between extremely disappointing and unacceptable. I and 7 colleagues were in your restaurant for a celebration of a successful event and the entire evening was less than satisfactory, let alone celebratory. It began shortly after we were seated when our waitress (I believe her name was Kristen) spilled an entire tray of ice water down my back, onto my seat which held my coat and a recently purchased Michael Kors handbag, and a shopping bag from Sephora. Understandably - accidents happen. However, the lack of response to the incident by management and the servers only remedy being to hang up my jacket (which was still wet when we left 1.5 hours later and I ventured into 43 degree weather) was unacceptable. No one from the management team stopped by our table to check on us or see if any resolution was needed, or to offer even a slice of cheesecake for the inconvenience, instead, I had to endure the rest of the meal in a soggy shirt and pants with damp hair and attempt to dry my handbag off in the restroom. Our server did ask if I was drying off about 12 minutes after the incident and said ""If it makes you feel better, I got wet, too."" Unnecessary comment and it did not help me feel better. To add insult to the situation our servers demeanor was curt the entire evening. When I asked for my mojito for the 3rd time...about 18 minutes after I ordered it and 5 minutes after everyone else's drinks came from the bar she cut me off stating ""I'm making it, I'm going to make it right now."" Someone in our party asked her how her day was and she replied that she was having the worst day she'd had in a year. EVERYONE is entitled to have an off day/evening/week/month, however, in the service industry I expect more of a poker face if you expect customers to reward your service in the form of gratuity. On a more positive note the food did arrive as ordered, albeit at this point my appetite was minimal. I hope that this feedback is used to improve the service in your Kenwood location for future customers.

The shrimp scampi was excellent. No noodles with it as it came with the steak Dianne. The medallions were done a little bit more than the medium I requested but still good. The sauce and mushrooms were delicious! It came with mashed potatoes which were so flavorful! The 3 were excellent and a good-sized portion. Yum! The service was excellent - especially the manager. He bent over backwards to make our wait more tolerable, bringing me a high chair to set the baby down. Even went as far as to bring her a little plate of sliced bananas and assorted bread! Wow. I was too stuffed for dessert but will definitely have to go again.

We moved ourselves to a better location since the staff seemed oblivious. My wife ordered the fried catfish and noticed it seemed very ""fatty"".  It seemed sort of undercooked (though nearly burned on the outside).  She ate most of one piece before giving up. At midnight that night, she got violently ill and spent the weekend vomiting and various other acts I won't mention. She has sworn off Cheesecake Factory forever (we'll see), but at the very least will always be very leery of improperly cooked food. She should have followed her instincts and sent it back.

45,Evan M.,"Cincinnati, OH",44,17,6.0,4.0,2014-09-11,"I have eaten here many times. This trip I stopped in for lunch and sat at the bar. I ordered the Firecracker Salmon appetizer and a slice of the Godiva Cheesecake.  The Salmon was good, my only complaint is that if their menu says the appetizer is enough to share, I expect a little more. Especially since it was only $2 cheaper than some entrees I was eyeing. The dish is strips of salmon, wrapped in spinach, and then wrapped in a large won ton style wrapper and fried until crisp. It has a spicy miso sauce served on the bottom of the plate (that isn't spicy at all). The plate it's served on is quite large, but there's only 4 pieces. There is a HUGE mound of raw red cabbage that serves as a device to prop up the salmon and make it look pretty. I think they would be better served by doing something with the cabbage. Make it an Asian slaw, or swap it out for something else like a salad of some kind. As it is, who wants to eat dry shaved cabbage? They missed an opportunity there. Still it was quite tasty.  And the cheesecake? Let me tell you, I don't like cheesecake. However, I will eat it from here. The Godiva cheesecake is so rich and chocolaty... it's heaven. It's a flourless Godiva chocolate cake on the bottom, Godiva chocolate cheesecake on top with chunks of Godiva chocolate in the middle. And lots of whipped cream. What more can you ask for? Next time I may skip the Salmon and just go for an entree. Why pay $11 for that when I can get a full entree for $13?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cincinnati?start=120,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.576,3.4000000000000004

Their raspberry lemonade is my favorite non alcoholic drink served at any restaurant. It does not come from a soda fountain, but is mixed at the bar. Just when it seems a bit too sour, I lick some of the sugar off the rim of the glass and I am happy again. The wild blueberry cheesecake was good. It could have used a few more blueberries (our server commented that we got a piece with a lot.) The consistency and flavor were nice.   Lucky for them that I didn't only order food or this would be a 1 or 2 star review.  The cooks use heavy cream to make the eggs light and fluffy. While a common practice, it seems they added too much.  I could taste the cream more that the eggs. Filling was a little light. Filling wasn't cooked very much making it seem like more than it was. Only one piece of avocado. As you can see in the picture, the potatoes were overdone. Some were hard like chips while others were hard on the outside with a bit of softness in the middle. The English muffin was of the standard grocery store verity.  My husband ordered the Kobe burger. While he ordered it medium, it was very well done. It was obvious they made his fries before the burger, as they were cold upon delivery. On a positive note, the fresh baked bread was indeed fresh. It was still steaming when it arrived at our table.

Let me say that this place always seems to be busy whenever we are here and we usually just sit at the bar to eat anyway, because I hate to wait to be seated.  Plus, the bar staff here is really awesome and very friendly.  I do feel that the menu is massive, to say the least.....it can take 10 minutes or more just to browse the menu.  Plus the portions are large - I can never eat all of whatever I get in one sitting, so leftovers it is! The bar list is pretty expansive as well, but I think they are pricey. We had a event to be at at 8pm, so about 6:45pm we ordered some appetizers while we were at the bar.  We ordered the Cuban Rolls and Pretzel Chicken Tenders - they were both good. They came out pretty quickly and they were both steaming hot.   After that we ordered a slice of the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake to split for dessert, because....well why else was I here except to get me some cheesecake for mah belly!  We have had several of the flavors here but tonight opted for this one. As we were finishing eating and getting our check, they were ready to seat our party, about 7:15pm.  They do not take any call ahead reservations or wait lists for large groups, which would be nice, so that is a bummer.

We only had to wait for 15 minutes because we were here on a week night...I would never try to get a spot here on the weekend (I can't stand waiting!), but it's really conveniently located in the Kenwood Mall. For dinner, I got the skinnylicious chicken salad sandwich. This is off of their low calorie menu, which is really great. They have so many things on the low cal menu, and they don't even taste like you're missing anything! The chicken salad sandwich is my favorite...The bread is toasted and buttery, and super crunchy which I love. My salad on the side was super tasty as well. My fiance ordered the chicken and biscuits which was extremely delicious, but definitely not low calorie! The dish needed more gravy because it was a little dry, and his food came out somewhat luke warm. I feel like that happens a lot here because the people in the table next to us also got not very hot food. But his mashed potatoes were soooo good, I couldn't stop stealing them off of his plate (there go all the calories I saved...). I never seem to have room leftover for cheesecake because their portions are HUGE...Which is a shame because I love cheesecake! Maybe next time I'll just get an appetizer and get cheesecake for dessert. I like the decor, and the server was very attentive. It took us a little while to get our food, and it is crazy busy.

That said, while eating here too much would likely leave you in an early grave the flavors they impart are divine. This is not the place to go if you are on a diet.

67,Ronnie R.,"Cincinnati, OH",39,3,,1.0,2015-04-02,"First, I tried to complete a guest survey online but there is no ""invitation reference number"" located on the receipt for me to enter. Let me start out by saying that our waitress was kind and very nice and personable. The experience of dining at Cheesecake factory in regards to the service put forth and the cleanliness I encountered was nothing less than deplorable.  I waited for 10min after being seated to request am ice water with lemon and the other party that was with me ordered a pomegranate mixed beverage.  The server returned with news that CCF no longer serves anything with or associated with pomegranate. So another beverage was requested. As we sat and waited my friend noticed the silverware and napkin was filthy. They had actually been used and the fork had cake frosting and crumbs on it. The spoon as well. The napkin had what appeared to be chocolate or some other stain on it. Soon after the drinks were brought to the table and the water was without lemon.  We notified our server about the silverware and she viewed it and cringed. She exclaimed that ""it must have been mixed up with the clean silverware or something because that is not even remotely clean and I am so sorry!"" At this time I requested the lemons for the water, again as well.  She left and returned moments later with a new set of silverware and a napkin.  We placed our orders for salad and lettuce wraps and waited. About 15 min later the order arrived.  When the server returned to check in my friend ordered another beverage. Several moments later the server returned to notify him that no alcoholic beverages could be served once the restaurant closed.  We finished our dishes and I ordered cheesecake once the server returned. That was brought out about ten mins later. I requested a fork and was told that she would be right back with one. Literally 15 minutes later, still no fork. My friend left the table to try to get someone to bring a fork. By this time the cheesecake was unappealing as it sat on the table thawing and the chocolate and whipped cream melting. (It was uncomfortable heated in the back of the restaurant.) Finally a fork was brought out with several apologies. A co-worker came to the table and said that our server was dealing with the manager over some drama in the back and that it wasn't her fault. Anyway, to keep the peace I ate some of the cheesecake. Our server returned and inquired how it was, and I told her it was honestly terrible. She said, again I am so sorry, and if we would like our checks or if there was anything else she could bring us. At this point we asked for the check.  The check was brought out and to our surprise the drink that my friend had ordered but was not served was on the bill.  This resulted in another wait in which my friend left the table to get rectified. The server explained that the manager did take it off the check and that the copy we were given was incorrect.  We paid and then left the table. As we walked out another staff member apologized for the issues and said to have a good night.  So, this is the experience my friend and I had. And yes we left gratuity, the girl has bills to pay. But again, this was our experience. I will not be returning to Cheesecake Factory because this is the 2nd time in 3 months that I have visited CCF to only regret it. The last time I was there the waitress blatantly requested we hurry it up because they close at 11pm. This was at 10:35pm. We were rushed out and it was just a rude gesture on her part, which is why I had not returned until recently. But this experience takes the cake - really!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cincinnati?start=140,2.76,3.18,3.18,3.0120000000000005,3.0120000000000005

37,Gloria Z.,"Hempstead, NY",114,309,1192.0,2.0,2015-04-27,"OK, so, ""The Cheesecake Factory."" Seems if you're reading this review, either you've never been to one of these, or you're wondering if ""this one"" is any different from other ones you've been to.  (It's not, with the possibly exception of the parking situation.) This is a place you either like a lot, or strongly dislike.  I think if you enjoy spending time in huge crowded shopping malls, this will be your kind of place.  For me, I don't care for either, and the only reason I have eaten at one of these four times in my life (most recently yesterday) is due to having received a gift card and not wanted it to go to waste.   To me, Cheesecake Factory is the epitome and definition of the huge corporate bloated nationwide chain, with a too-huge and unfocused menu, usually located (appropriately) in a huge. sprawling bloated suburban mall with a huge parking lot. (In this particular case, though, the parking lot is NOT huge enough.  It is so undersized -- or rather the mall oversized -- that they offer VALET parking for the MALL.  Be warned! Even the name of the place turns me off.  Who wants to eat at a ""Factory""? And that's what it feels like inside most times.  As has been suggested, if you must go here to spend a gift card, aim for the bar.  They do offer some creative cocktails (and fortunately, gift cards do not exclude alcohol!) Service? Could go either way, as you see from the great variance on that subject in the reviews. A corporate enterprise of this size has scores of employees, so on any given Saturday afternoon who knows which ones will be there, unlike a local restaurant where a manageable number of regular employees have pretty regular shifts and you know what to expect.  We've seen both ends of the service spectrum here.  Food? Some items are pretty tasty, yes,  but everything gives the impression of mass production, almost like upscale fast food. Sometimes it comes out really, really fast.  A little TOO fast, if you know what I mean. Combine this with the warehouse atmosphere, I just can find no reason to recommend this place as a dining choice.   This could be a ""good for kids"" restaurant, except, how would you like to show up with a babe in arms plus two runny-nosed whining toddlers and then find out you have to wait 45 minutes for a table, only to be squeezed next to an unhappy couple (who didn't read Yelp first) who'll then be shooting you angry looks throughout the meal as you spill over into what tiny amount of privacy they had to begin with? I would recommend the establishment if you want to purchase a big, delicious cheesecake for a special occasion.

He ordered 1/2 and 1/2 sweet and unsweet tea, and our waiter, Marquis, kept his glass full, bringing both pitchers to the table with each refill.  A shout out to Marquis for outstanding service and attention to detail.  It is those types of little things that make a dining experience worth five stars, and this definitely was.   For our grand finale, we ordered three types of cheesecakes and again shared them all, flourless Godiva Chocolate, Chocolate Tuxedo Cream, and Mango Key Lime.

I've tried a lot of different things on their menu. There are many good choices. Back in my vegetarian days when I ate nothing buy pasta, I loved their four cheese pasta and their alfredo pasta.

After about an hour wait (half price cheesecake is VERY popular), we were seated and enjoying the complimentary bread.  For me, the Cheesecake Factory is a place where you need to understand the menu and the food. Many of the menu options are absolutely loaded with calories and sodium (even some of their salads are questionable). And their lowest calorie cheesecake (non-low carb option) is a whopping 700 calories for one slice! The portion sizes are also very large (which adds to all the extra calories), and never have I seen anyone finish a full serving of any of their pasta entrees in one sitting. Having this information in mind, it is easier to plan accordingly. I usually opt for an appetizer off their Skinnylicious menu and only eat half, then splurge on a cheesecake.

Being the only Cheesecake Factory in the Cincinnati metro (until the one on Liberty Way opens, anyway), naturally people flock here to get their cheesecake on. The menu's large, and management apparently have been stung by years of health magazines gawking at the incredibly waistline-expanding calories contained in almost all of their entrees, it had come up with a new Skinnylicious menu composed of dishes that are similarly rich in taste at only 590 calories or less. We went there to celebrate my wife's birthday. The place was packed, per usual. Don't bother making reservations on Saturdays and Sundays. They don't take them. Instead, they'll only take reservations during the week. I guess they don't want to leave a table empty in case someone who reserved a table decided to not show up. Anyway, we were told that our wait would be about 30 to 40 minutes. We got our table in about 20. So that's cool. After we sat down, our server helped us to devise a virgin fuzzy peach drink for my wife, who was very pregnant at this time. Our entrees came very quickly. I had their Jamaican black pepper shrimp and my wife their sweet tamale cake. For dessert, she had their lemon raspberry cheesecake and I tiramisu. In short, the food was great and definitely hit the right spot. No, we didn't order off of the Skinnylicious menu. So why the 1 star off? Because of two things. One, the floor was extremely slippery. My wife, being pregnant as she was, found it difficult to get up and walk without constantly feeling like she's gonna fall. Second, while our server was fast and very attentive, it was also obvious that she's under pressure by management to keep the tables turning to seat new patrons. Our meal felt a bit rushed towards the end, but it's no big deal.

This is a chain restaurant, but I am so glad it is because I can always find one when I am craving some guaranteed good cheesecake. This is a great place for big groups. Granted around meal times and especially on weekends you will have to wait awhile, and I don't think they take reservations. Also, it's at Kenwood so there is difficult mall parking sometimes. However, worth it when you want to get your Cheesecake fix.  They always make sure you have water. My family likes to get the flavored iced tea. Then they always bring you some of their complimentary bread, which who doesn't love free bread! (Be ready to eat when you come here!) They have a delicious honey wheat with oats on it and a typical French bread. The wheat will change your life, so good! (As I write this I am getting excited that I have plans to eat here again soon!) Their menu is VERY LARGE! If you aren't sure what type of food you want, this can be a good choice because they have all types of food. Also, if you're looking for something specific chances are they have it! Every meal I have had here is good. They also have a Skinny menu, which I appreciate so I can also enjoy the bread and cheesecake. The ricotta and sausage flatbread is so good, and be warned it does have a bit of garlic on it! The lettuce wraps with chicken are also scrumptious and you feel so full after! All of the cheesecakes I have tried are AMAZING! I am particularly excited about the pumpkin cheesecake right now. However, the Oreo, cookie dough, basically all of the cheesecake you can't go wrong!

In the UK, we don't go in much for doggy bags but here it is pretty much what's going to happen, because you are bestowed with heaped plates of everything (not a complaint!). The corn tamale thing is my favourite appetizer, it's so tasty, but huge, so share it! Cookie dough cheesecake all the way.

2,Tina K.,"Cincinnati, OH",531,201,,1.0,2016-04-03,"This is for a visit on Friday, April 1st.  Had this been my 1st visit, it would be my last.  I've been here numerous other times and those visits would rate at least 3 or 4 stars.   I arrived at 3:15, not a terribly busy time, and was told to wait before being seated for no apparent reason.  Once seated, my server arrived almost immediately to take my drink order.  I asked for a glass of ice water and a glass of white wine.  I also put in an order of Crispy Crab Bites.  The ice water arrived first and it was in a plastic mug with a handle.  Maybe it's just me but I prefer ice water to be in an actual glass.  Less than 5 minutes after ordering, my crispy crab bites arrived.  They were lukewarm at best.  I was almost done with them when the glass of wine finally showed up.  Not sure why but it always takes soooo long to get something from the bar here.  I ordered the pasta w/ shrimp & sausage but asked them to skip the shrimp and make it just sausage.  My server asked if I wanted bread and I said I did.  She brought the bread dish and a small bowl containing 2 pats of butter that were hard as a rock.  No possible way of spreading butter on the bread.  The menu says my pasta dish is  served w/ marinara sauce & basil.  When the dish arrived, the little bit of sauce on it was dried onto the pasta and it was an odd orange color.  It reminded me of cream of tomato soup.  This is not how marinara sauce is supposed to look.  They did skip the shrimp but the dish only had 4 clumps of sausage.  There were 3 long green wilted strips of what I'm assuming was supposed to be basil but it looked very unappetizing and I removed them from the bowl.  I asked for extra sauce which was brought out quickly but the odd orange color made it very unappealing.  As for the taste of the dish itself, quite frankly I could prepare something better in my own kitchen.  As I tried working my way thru it, I bit into a stem of some sort and a few bites later I bit into what appeared to be an onion piece but I couldn't chew it.  While all of this is going on, there was a woman bussing tables all around me and I can honestly say there is no possible way she could have made any more noise than she did.  I realize that gathering silverware can cause some clatter but this was clatter to the EXTREME as she struggled to cram it into the used glasses.  When placing new plates onto the bussed tables, she reminded me of a poker dealer as she tossed them onto the tables and they slid, very noisily across to their places.  The only redeeming factor to this visit was the piece of key lime cheesecake I ordered to go.  Like I said earlier, I've been here many times and it has always been much better than this visit.  I usually order the Steak Diane and it's fabulous.  This visit has changed my opinion of this place though.  As I walked out, I actually felt like I wanted my money back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cincinnati?start=80,3.16,3.27,3.27,2.308,3.226

6,Alyssa R.,"Columbus, OH",101,13,,1.0,2016-09-09,"So we're in from out of town and decide to order take out from this location. I placed our order at 6:15, they tell me it'll be 20-25 mins for two apps, an entree (pasta), a side salad and a piece of cheesecake. Ok, no problem. I drive the 15 mins it takes to get to the restaurant arriving at the curbside parking spots by 6:35. I could have walked in but I'm 36 weeks pregnant with my toddler in the car, not the easiest thing to manage. I call the number, describe my car, they tell me our food will be out in a couple mins. At 6:55 a server walks out with someone else's food who arrived 15 mins after we did. She takes my credit card and says she'll be right back. She comes back with our food at 7:05. She's nice enough and it's not her fault everything took so long so I don't punish her by not tipping, that's not cool. It appears all of our food is there. I drive the 15 mins back to our hotel and by this time (if you've ever been pregnant) I'm practically starving. I open the box with the $4.95 side salad that is not worth the money as its a handful of mixed greens with 1 slice of cucumber and two wedges of tomato. And NO dressing. Now this seems like no big deal but it's not like I just have dressing laying around my hotel room. I call the restaurant, the server I speak to initially asks if I wanna come pick up some dressing. WHAT?! No, I want you to take the salad off my bill. She puts me on the phone with the manager, Sarah I'm pretty sure she said. I explain the situation, she tells me the dressing is probably hiding in the box, No I checked already, she asks me if I wanna come pick up some dressing. WHAT?! No, I want you to take the salad off my bill. After everything she's willing to take half the price of the salad off my bill. You've got to be kidding me. The amount of money Cheesecake makes every year, scratch that every day you'd think they can afford the overpriced salad for the lack of prep and customer service they're offering.

I don't come here too often because I as much as I hate chains, I hate waiting to eat even more. I came on a Sunday evening between lunch and dinner and we only had about a fifteen minute wait which I was able to handle.  Our server was super nice, made great recommendations and conversation. I try to get something different every time I come so I opted for the lunch portioned spaghetti and meatballs and these buffalo chicken wonton things for an appetizer. My experience dining in was great. Here's where this place drops to 2 stars. My mother wanted chicken and biscuits brought to her  as she didn't want to come out. My friend and I did a little shopping and then I decided to call in the order before we walked back over to the restaurant. They said 25 minutes which was fine. We walked back after 15 and I paid and added 2 pieces of cheesecake to the order.  The line to order to go is a little crazy. It's difficult to tell where it begins and ends, people just stand everywhere (mostly in the way) and the worst part is the serious disorganization of the staff working the counter. I mean it's just straight up confusion. The 25 minute wait ended up being more like 40 minutes all together and I'm thinking 10 of those minutes was the staff not really knowing what to do.

Let me tell you, they did not disappoint. I went for the mac-and-cheese burger and it was honestly really really good. It's basically a burger with a big slab of their fried macaroni on top..simple but quite tasty. I opted out of putting the pickles and onions on it that I had originally requested because I didn't want to mess with the flavor (it also comes with lettuce and tomato but I always ask for that to be taken off). The mac and cheese complimented the hamburger perfectly..like an extremely cheesy cheeseburger. The burger patty itself was kind of small in circumference but very thick and flavorful in the middle. This burger was good enough to warrant a place on my best burgers of Cincinnati list for sure! Also the waitress we had last night was amazing.

So for about 10 minutes I sat by myself without any greeting from my waiter (who past by several times). Finally when the remaining people sat down he started off the greeting with ""I'm sorry ma'am, I wasn't ignoring you I was just waiting for the rest of your party"".

However, the server was very friendly and accommodating to everyone - she was certainly working very hard. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food, although it was nothing special. Their menu is huge, which is a turn-off for me because it doesn't mean they specialize in anything. It's a nice atmosphere inside, but many of us thought it was cold..... perhaps it was where we were sitting? Everyone of course had to order a cheesecake for dessert. I ordered based on the presentation of the cheesecake displays (the Oreo cheesecake), but I was rather disappointed. It was good, but not excellent like everyone raves about.

We arrived, and after a brief wait we were seated. Our server greeted us by simply asking what we wanted to drink, we didn't learn her name until we received our receipt at the end of our visit. We ordered our food, and recieved bread while we waited. A different server dropped off our food, and as he walked away, our server walked up with drink refills and asked if everything was okay. Since we had just got our food, we said it was, and she walked away. I kept getting bites of undercooked, chewy pasta, and didn't want to finish eating it. We waited almost 15 minutes before our server returned, and her first question was ""do you need a box?"". If you have been gone from the table long enough for THAT to be your first question upon returning, you've been gone from the table for too long.... At that point, my fiancé was finished with his meal, and both of our beverages were empty. I informed her that my food was not satisfactory, she offered to have it remade, but I didn't want to wait that long for new pasta since my fiancé was already finished with his meal and we were ready to leave. I informed the server that we just wanted the check and to leave. She offered to have the pasta made to go, and I declined. She asked if we wanted dessert to go, and we ordered a cheesecake slice. We expected a manager to stop by our table, seeing as one of us was leaving without eating dinner, but no one stopped by. We eventually asked for a manager ourself, because we were so put off by this experience, and didn't understand why a manager hadn't stopped by sooner. A manager stopped by and told us he was aware that my pasta had come out undercooked, and had taken it off the bill, but he was not aware that because of our server taking so long to check back on the table, that we had decided to leave instead of having the meal remade. He apologized, and took the cost of the cheesecake off of the bill. Tonight was a total waste of time, and money.

We walked around the mall and surprisingly got seated early, around 7:20pm. Once at the table, we went to order drinks and I was disappointed to learn that their draft beer lines weren't working. Not wanting to have a dry evening, we both ordered two mixed drinks. They were good and hit that sweet spot between too strong and too light. I got the Pineapple Mule and she had the strawberry lemonade. The bread that came before our meal was deliciously fresh and share-able. For dinner, I ordered the Pasta Carbonara with Chicken and she ordered the Orange Chicken with Rice. The portions were wonderful for the price. The meals had a really good flavor without being overly spiced and without fancy ""premiums"" - simple, delicious food.  For dessert, she ordered a slice of Tiramisu Cheesecake and I had the Oreo Cheesecake. We were both really happy with the Oreo Cheesecake, but something about the Tiramisu tasted...off. I suppose Tiramisu just wasn't our cup of tea. She actually ordered it as a recommendation from the waiter after we learned the Coffee Kailua Cheesecake is being phased off the menu...bummer!

Cheesecake Factory gets docked big time for the wait on seating. Every time I've been there the location near us is never really busy. Often less than half the tables are occupied. Somehow,  though, it is always a 10-15 minute wait while I stare at open table after open table. For a chain this size not to be able to properly staff their restaurant on such a consistent basis is rude and annoying. If the food quality ever drops I doubt I would ever dine there again. This is a problem that needs to be solved at the highest levels of corporate management. It sets a horrible tone even before a menu is delivered.

I highly recommend the crab and artichoke dip. It comes with a really large size portion of dip, but it definitely needed more bread which we had to ask for. I had the coconut lime chicken curry, also fantastic. It had amazing flavor, with roasted coconut on the top.  The cheesecake: super sweet, but really good. They have a good 35+ flavors, including seasonal flavors.  The Wait: On a Saturday at noon we had a 3 minute wait, which was a surprise, I anticipated it being longer.  The Service: The 3 star review comes purely from the lack of service we received. We had to almost beg for refills, from a server that wasn't ours, because we never saw ours. She never stopped to ask if we needed anything, never asked if we had everything we needed when delivering an appetizer, she would drop it off and run. Someone else delivered our main food. We asked another server for bread that they normally bring out, to which we were told we'd have to wait because there was none. I'm not sure how that happens if they plan for a weekend lunch rush. They used to box your food at the end of the meal, and today she just tossed the boxes and left. I'm not sure if that was only this occasion or if they stopped providing that service. Then we had to find her to ask for our check (I would have hoped the boxes would have been a clue we would like dessert or the check).

I don't think the rude laziness was on our server's part, she looked like she was going to burst into tears when I gave her a probably stony stare of disapproval when she kept demurring about how the kitchen would refuse to split the Chicken Bellagio onto two places for my daughter and I. She told me that she would add the directions on the order but that the cooks would likely ignore it. GREEEEAT.  And, it wasn't the poor server who brought out the Chicken Bellagio ON ONE BLOODY PLATE, and who hastily managed to split the dish onto two plates at a station. I did NOT want to do it because we were seated crammed into one of those tiny two-person booths which was already overcrowded with water mugs and the bread plates. I asked the 2nd server what was the deal with their kitchen staff's attitudes about providing a minor customer service and she said ""oh you know, it gets crazy back there and they just don't have the time."" NONONONOOOOOO. What a weak excuse. It was lunch time and the place was half empty. If I'm paying $20 for one entree AT LUNCH then one cook back there should hopefully not be so incompetent that they can't plop noodles onto OMFG two separate plates *world spins off its axis*  Also, when we left, I was interested in their promo of buying a gift card for family members' Christmas presents and getting a free slice of cheesecake. But no, it was a bait-and-switch, you can't redeem the free cheesecake until 2018. I'll just get a gift card to O'Chucks or Olive Garden at Kroger and get the 4x fuel points promo - both restaurants probably don't have kitchen staff with misguided white collar egos that think their time is too invaluable to split a dish in half.  Cheesecake Factory, either scale down your menu to a manageable size or hire cooks that aren't so annoyingly lazy.
