197,DA K.,"Columbia, MD",1,25,,1.0,2012-03-08,I've only been here twice and was not pleased at all about my visits. This place is totally overrated and over priced. I was just dying to go here for the first time because I wanted to see what everyone was bragging on being so good and to see why there was always an incredible long wait for. Well after being there twice I would say. NOT WORTH IT. My food had no taste at all. No seasoning. I had the Cajun seafood and it was no where near Cajun. In my opinion they need to stick with their name CHEESECAKES.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=240,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5000000000000004,3.0000000000000004

109,Jill W.,"Atlanta, GA",303,272,272.0,5.0,2012-05-15,"Nothing has ever disappointed here. I'm not even one to care about bad service, but we've always had exemplary servers here. That said, onto the food. I actually close my eyes and savor the food here, which is a good sign. Some items that have elicited that reaction include: -shrimp toast on a stick w/ sauce: these could be properly described as shrimp and veggie meatballs paired with an orange/pink sauce...clean and fresh with a nice crust -vietnamese tacos (don't be fooled--I would have usually been turned off thinking of having to bite into a hard corn shell, but NO, this came with those white, enriched-flour steamed buns used in asian pastry stores! Like a pork bun, with laces of red pepper and lettuce--yum) -chicken samosas with a green sauce (these are unique; it's like ground meat in a thin, crispy phyllo dough type of wrapper; I appreciate that better than the tough, thick, fried dough that usually encases samosas in Indian food places. So it's not real traditional samosas, but I'd say if you're into low-carb, you'd appreciate) -thai lettuce wraps (better than P.F. Changs, hands down! Big, clean pieces of lettuce, good quality chicken filling, and several sauces to choose from, along with sprouts, purple lettuce, etc. this is a meal in itself, one of the largest appetizers) -summer rolls (better than the ones from real pho places...sorry, those run the risk of tasting fishy but the ones here at Cheesecake are Americanized to the point where there isn't that ""fishy"" taste) -Evelyn's favorite pasta (great vegetarian option) -Salmon, diane steak, shrimp combo platter (small cuts of meat that do not overwhelm, but there are several pieces so the portion size is ample overall) -salads (these are HUGE and can be taken home) -and of course, the cheesecakes and desserts...the ultimate red velvet cheesecake was a trip. Anyway, the general idea is that everything I've tried has been done very well and exceeded my expectations.  This particular store is great because it's next to the mall and movie theatre and it opens late--no one really chases you out. They turn on the lights politely :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=200,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.9000000000000004,3.2000000000000006
192,Joel F.,"Buffalo, NY",17,13,5.0,3.0,2012-05-24,It is a Cheese Cake Factory chain and it was good.  Service was excellent and didn't spend a whole lot of time waiting for a table.  It was a good experience ......  again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=240,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.668,3.2800000000000002
107,SA F.,"Frederick, MD",1,121,103.0,1.0,2012-06-18,"We tried this place out for Mother's Day - HORRIBLE.  WILL NOT GO BACK  I called ahead for our party of twelve (12) & was told there was no call ahead seating, but the wait time would be 1-2 hours, starting when our party arrived.  Okay, so we drove an hour to go there.   Once we got to the front of the line to get in line for a table, I was told I would have to wait to speak with the Manager to get a real wait time.  REALLY?  So ten (10) minutes later, the MANAGER tells me it will be 5-6 **HOURS** until we can be seated.  It's 2 pm on a Sunday & (now that all 12 of us - including 6 kids) are there, we can wait until 8 or 9 PM for lunch.  Hmmm.. I think not.   It's almost like they didn't want our business.  How bout telling me over the phone ""we are slammed, we just cannot accommodate such a large party today"" but no, you tease me with the 1-2 hour wait time enticing me to drive an hour to get to your restaurant, then surprise me with some BULL CRAP 5-6 HOUR WAIT TIME?  Ridiculous.  I can't believe the manager kept a straight face while feeding me this line of crap.  So I suggest we break down into three (3) parties - party of 3, party of 4 & party of 5.  He tells me it will be 1-2 hours.  Okay, fine, we will sit separately.  I go shopping while hubby & kids wait for the table.  30 minutes later I get the call - our table is ready.  Really?  Can't they use a computer for a real wait time?  I used to be a hostess in a busy restaurant & we used to pull the numbers out of our backsides (total guess work), but that was 20 years ago & I didn't work at an upscale place like the Cheesecake Factory. Service was okay, food was okay - I will NEVER go back to the Columbia store because of the CRAPTASTIC manager.  I wrote to Corporate, but they did nothing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=200,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.468,3.2000000000000006

175,Sue S.,"Baltimore, MD",0,37,,4.0,2012-08-09,"We are Cheesecake Factory aficionados, having visited quite a few of them in all parts of the country.  Therefore, we are used to the long wait times that is typical for many locations, so that is not a factor in this review. We just moved to the area recently, and have visited this location 3 times so far.  It's pretty good for the most part.  The chicken piccata, steak diane and salads were all excellent, but the chicken marsala was not up to the usual standards the night we had it. Service was mostly good, except when we had the server in training. The music was a bit too loud.

183,Daniela M.,"Columbia, MD",24,32,41.0,1.0,2012-10-16,"This place serves generous portions of mediocre food. The Cajun Jambalaya pasta had no flavor whatsoever and the Pasta with Meat Sauce was nothing special. I ordered the Key Lime pie cheesecake and could not finish eating it because it was too sour (yes, I had good KL pie before and just loved it). On the other hand, my husband had the pumpkin pecan and he said it was really good. I went to this specific location twice and both times I noticed that the staff likes to gather around the register during their breaks.

103,Janet P.,"Charles Town, WV",71,263,221.0,3.0,2012-11-18,"Came here with a friend who wanted to come for dinner this week, I'm not a CF fan but this was probably the best one I've been to thus far. We were told the wait was 20min, we waited a bit longer than that (like 30min) and then we proceeded to talk to the hostess who then immediately got us a seat right after. We had also called the place to try and make a reservation but they told us that they don't take reservations. Bunch of stuck-up overdressed customers were here, packed parking-lot around the area as well... thought I had just arrived at Tysons 2 or something, lol. The bread was good that we got before our food arrived. The black tea I didn't care for as it was strong and bitter, but I didn't want to get there fruit flavored tea, so I stuck to drinking the water. The artichoke dip was fair but could've been a bit better I thought. I got the spicy cashew chicken which was pretty tasty and not overly spicy which was good because I like to enjoy my food without breaking a sweat, this was definitely the best CF dish I've tried thus far but something about it still seemed a bit off to me. I also had the Godiva Cheesecake which was pretty much the way it sounded but topped with a dallop of whip cream on top and another dallop on the plate. The decor looks like most CF factories, like a knock-off version of a Las Vegas establishment, heh. The 2-people tables are small (one side booth and one side chair) and very close to the neighboring tables, luckily my butt didn't get in someones food upon sitting on the booth side. The menu's looked like a book, we joked how they might as well have us open a huge newspaper but then we'd hit the people beside us, lol. Our waitress was good to us (although had a weird voice which made it hard to understand with all the noise in the place), but I noticed any African-American customers kept getting bad service or something, no clue what was up with that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=200,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.604,3.2800000000000002
101,Erika S.,"Owings Mills, MD",60,28,4.0,4.0,2012-11-23,"You know, there is only so much you can say about a chain restaurant.  The food was on par with expectations.  However, I wish there was a bit more light available within the restaurant.  I know it is supposed to be romantic, but  I felt like it was past the point of passionate first date atmosphere.  It was more like, 'please hand me a flashlight as I manuever my way to my booth without killing myself'.  Then, of course, I cannot read the menu because it is so dark.  I am not that old.  However, I found myself wishing I had one of those magnifier light thingys I see on TV.  My 20/20 vision was no match for the combination of small letters and dim lighting. Our server was nice.  She was new so she was being shadowed by a more experienced server.  Now while I have the patience of a saint, my cousins were a different story.  When we were providing our orders to the server, he asked if they could add bacon to his burger.  The server proceeded to tell him that she didn't think he could.  The trainer stepped in and said he could.  However, my cousin never let go of the fact that she said he couldn't add bacon to his burger.  Nevertheless, the only issue I had with her is that her language on occasion was a bit informal.  When we needed items packed up for to go boxes, she said 'Yea sure, give it here"".  So, for me, if that is the only issue I have going to a commercial joint like the Cheesecase Factory, that is a satisfactory service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=200,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.7359999999999998,3.3200000000000003

On my most recent visit, my waitress could not be found when needed more than once. When she was asked for the check she forgot which I can understand.  The second time we asked she responded with, ""Oh I didn't think you were really ready for the check.""  Once we were ready to pay the check she never stopped by to cash us out so we had to ask another waiter.   I tasted the Cream of Mushroom Soup, The Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll, Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes, and Miso Salmon.  All of these food items were delicious.  The only reason my rating is not worse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=200,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.44,3.2400000000000007

His response?  Sorry, we have new cooks.   New cooks?  This is a well known chain restaurant.  People come here for known dishes of a known quality, and they pay rather highly for that along with a moderately upscale ambience.  The cooks need to perform regardless of how old or new they are, that's why they train them.   The only good explanation would have been if all the cooks were out at once and the waitstaff were forced to cook and some half-senile man was forced out of retirement to oversee the cooking.  Then perhaps we could have commiserated over his sad failure rather than the failure of this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=220,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.436,2.96

We were not greeted politely by the reservation desk personnel, they just looked and blinked at us without asking what we needed.  It was around 3 p.m., and the place was not that crowded, yet we were seated in a crummy corner near the kitchen. The waitress took forever to come over. She was curt, polite, but not very attentive and I had to beg for water and wait for her to be near to ask for another napkin.  The biggest disappointment and I was shocked about this one: the food.  I ordered the meatloaf which comes with mashed potatoes and succotash. The meatoaf was not tasty and had a huge amount of filler/bread so the texture was weird, potatoes were bland and too lumpy even for the rustic type, the succotash was fine, at least the corn was fresh. My friend's food was mediocre and we were very disappointed in what we thought would be a delicious meal.  My son's cheesecake was just not tasty at all. It might have been that they changed distributors and are cutting corners in terms of quality of ingredients, or maybe the cooks are not cooking the food correctly, or both---whatever the reason TCF has truly gone down the tubes.

Interestingly the waitress interpreted that to mean a steak added to the omelet even though he asked for a steak and egg meal. Go figure. But it gets worse. They take the omelet back and try again. This time omelet came out with one ingredient instead of 4 helpings of cheese and the steak was lukewarm and cold in 5 minutes. The manager finally came by only to argue that rare steak should be lukewarm. Now we all know that your meat has to be a certain temperature to meet health standards.

66,AJ M.,"Burtonsville, MD",25,16,,4.0,2014-06-21,"If you are not familiar with the Cheesecake Factory, the first thing I want to tell you is that if you don't like reading- don't come here. The menu is about ten dictionaries long, and split across several volumes like the Harry Potter series. When your server comes to ask if you've decided, you will literally burst out into maniacal laughter because you will only be twenty pages in and you're still looking at starter plates. Not to worry. Flip to a random page and point at something and odds are that it is delicious and there is a ton of it. Sarcasm aside, the selection of food here is diverse and extensive. If you don't know those two words, you are really going to have a hard to time with the menu here so you may consider bringing a tutor or some kind of speed-reader to help you along. They seriously have food from all cultures of the world, and even though you would think there's too many types of food for any of them to be great, they regularly excel in all areas. Portions are always immense and also gratifying if taking part of your meal home makes you feel less fat. I usually go for the Barbecue Ranch Chicken Salad because something about eating at Cheesecake Factory makes me feel like a hip young white woman. You might not encounter this issue, so dishes like Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp or the Factory Burrito are excellent choices as well. Appetizers like the Crab Wontons or Santa Fe Eggrolls are ridiculously good, but you probably won't find them in the labryinth of a menu. My bet is that you tap out around page 75 and ask the server what he recommends. Don't worry, it's foolproof. Just don't order a Glamburger. I don't know what it is but it sounds like something David Bowie would serve up at an under-21 foam party. If you leave without, at the very least, splitting a piece of Cheesecake- you are dooming yourself to a life without sun and joy. Trust me. You can count calories all day, but the torrent of endorphins your brain will release after one bite of Pineapple Upsidedown Cheesecake will be like a rain of a thousand orgasms. Just order it. If you're that worried, you can order a salad like I do so the waiter doesn't judge you when you finish the whole piece of cheesecake (he will anyway). As far as this specific Cheesecake Factory goes, the wait is long almost all the time. That's a good thing. It reaffirms your decision to come here because 45 minutes worth of other people thought coming here was a good idea too. The service has always been on-point and friendly for me, and if anyone else here got a different result, it's possible they ordered a Glamburger and it is effecting their mood. I took off a star because I can hear the waiter's thoughts when I eat the whipped cream pile after my cheesecake is gone.

The small plates on the table under the napkins weren't clean. The waitress heard when I said these aren't clean, turned around then turned back around pretending she heard not a thing. She never brought us plates, we even got our apps, still no plates. I got them from a random waitstaff men that I waved down. Also my nephew asked, ""why is it that when you speak to him, he speaks back and when you ask him to do something he does it.... Why doesn't OUR waitress behave that way?"" From the mouths of babes.... Strike 2. The waitress was not friendly nor accommodating. I'm here with children ages 8, 12, 13, & 17, she addressed no one. More aloof and irritated that we were making her have to work. Strike 3. At present, this chick is getting a 10% tip with a comment on my bill from me.  I'm not impressed. As I left, my very absent waitress Ashley was discovered to be chatting it up at server station by the bar. She: 1. Did take the small plates after I addressed her directly that they were all dirty. She never brought us more. We were served bread & our appetizers and still no plates. I had to wave down a random server. He got us the plates. The plates were stored in the cabinet directly in front of our table. He apologized for our waitress. 2. She never came back to clear our table after the entrees arrived. 3. She never gave eye contact. She was very short and seemingly annoyed. That was just her attitude. Yes, I was there with kids, but they know how to behave when out with me so, her attitude was not in anyway provoked. 4. Two random servers checked on us and we got boxes from them. The second server was who got our waitress because we were already packed up and needed the check. That server got her from wherever she was chatting & she then asked if we needed boxes (which clearly we didn't because we had already bagged & boxed ourselves AND consolidated all the plates so it would be easy to clear the table).  I decided not to tip her and to leave her a note on the check instead. The note just said that she missed out on the tip because her colleagues did what she was supposed to do. May I remind you, the restaurant was DEAD. Very few people there. More servers than patrons. I spoke to the manager as I left and he was embarrassed. I praised the other servers and let him know I an frequent customer (who lives very close by) and know her behavior was not standard.

65,Mang J.,"Redmond, WA",3,52,7.0,2.0,2014-07-31,"(Caveat: It's a truth universally acknowledged that The Ol' Mangaretta does not like chain restaurants.) A visit to the Cheesecake Factory equals mediocrity draped under the guise of quantity, but I am not easily fooled. Unfortunately, that's how every experience I've had at the factory usually ends. The only thing that varies wildly is the service. I've had some of the worst and some of the best service at several locations. During this last trip to the factory, it was only the stellar service provided by Amanda that kept this review from carrying a one-star rating. I think she should quit and open up a business where she teaches others how to provide exceptional service. At any rate, since I'm often outvoted by my pals, it's likely that I'll end up at the factory again. When I do, I hope Amanda's working so I can sit in her section. But...I don't care if they serve single portions that would take out Paul Bunyan and the Jolly Green Giant. The food just isn't good. Did someone lose the key to the spice cabinet? I don't want a bowl full of blah. Of all the dishes I've had at every location I've visited, there are probably two that are actually delicious--and that includes the cheesecake. While their cheesecake flavor concepts are wonderfully imaginative, the taste and texture of the cheesecake itself is similar to non-dairy whipped topping if it were thicker and somewhat creamier. Please, Cheesecake Factory, tweak your recipes to make them flavorful. So, two stars for the wonderful Amanda, who I hope harbors entrepreneurial dreams; and minus three stars for mammoth portions of blah food that's searching for its lost shaker of salt and other spices, and thickened Cool Whip for dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=140,3.04,3.05,3.05,2.504,3.046

Next, our server was pretty nice, but when we ordered spinach and artichoke dip, the chips came out completely stale. Like to the point where we were worried we would chip our teeth on them.

It was so awkward and uncomfortable. The manager insisted that her food had been cooked properly even though the waitress had already agreed with her that it was undercooked and offered to bring her something else, but after being confronted by the manager she insisted on paying her tab and leaving. The manager had the guts to stand next to her table and say ""No, I assure you, we would never give out raw food"" instead of just apologizing and comping the meal.

The lemonade was a little too sweet though. Then ordered sliders for appetizers and they were awesome as usual. We got enchiladas and salmon, respectively. Food took a long while to arrive at the table. Enchiladas were perfect and piping hot. Salmon was served with mashed potatoes and both were cold. The waitress brought a replacement plate of hot mashed potatoes so that remedied the situation a bit. The complementary bread and butter they served was also good. We were so full after drinks and appetizers that had to take most of entrées to go. Also got dessert to go, mango cheesecake, which was also good but going with another flavor next time.

The food tastes good at a fair price however the place is noisy and we could hardly hear the waiter or each other though we could hear people at other tables like AM radio atmospheric jumps.  If we go again it will be between regular meals.

32,Megan B.,"Silver Spring, MD",131,252,551.0,4.0,2015-05-14,"Summary: great food, great drinks, tough parking, lots of traffic.  Long story: I love the Cheesecake Factory. I mean, I have never had a bad meal here. The food is amazing every time. Yet again I was so starving that I forgot to take a picture of my Cuban sandwich with a side green salad tossed in honey citrus dressing. I can't even tell you how delicious this meal was. The sandwich comes on what can only be described as a miniature baguette. It's toasted, and the cheese is literally melting out of the sides of the sandwich. Definitely more than you can eat in one sitting.  My friend got the sweet corn tamale appetizer. It came with tomato and avocado, and was drizzled in some incredible chipotle sauce.  Also every flavor of cheesecake you could imagine. And they do not disappoint on the cheesecake.  Service was decent, and they have heat lamps for you to sit outside on a patio. I prefer the patio because something about the acoustics makes the atmosphere inside very loud. But they do have a small bar inside, which is nice.  So, this place is apparently across from a music venue (maybe Merriweather Pavilion?). Either way, traffic can be an absolute bear if you don't plan around the concerts. I drove up from Silver Spring today after work, and because a COVER BAND was performing, it took me over an hour and a half to get to the Cheesecake Factory. That's a long time to drive for dinner. So just plan for that. Also, this place is in a mall, and it's hard to find parking on the weekends, but not during the week so much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=40,3.28,3.05,3.05,2.416,3.142

My son and I walk up to a rather distracted hostess and asked for a table for three.  She spoke to me without looking at me and directed us to stand to the side.  Another woman came up to us and said, ""Table for two?"" I told her no, three.  She looks confused and speaks to the first hostess who says, ""She said two.  Now she wants three?"" Rolled her eyes and made a face.  The second hostess seemed annoyed with me.  I watched as at least four other groups were seated, all who came after us and two were also parties of three. The side plates were wet, the silverware was mostly dirty, and the server was rude.  I asked her for new plates, telling her they were wet and dirty.  She made a face and started examining them. ""Just this one is dirty,"" she said.  Great start, I'm thinking.   She messes up our drink order and barely is around expect to drop off our food and then our check.  The replacement silverware she brought was also dirty so we shared what was mostly clean.  I could not get out of there fast enough.  The food was a tiny bit above fast food and definitely not worth the prices charged. The service was rude and super pretentious for no reason.  I've been to other cheesecake factories so I knew going in it's a chain, but the Arundel Mills location is so much better. They are much nicer and serve uniform slices of cheesecake. It was confusing when I got home and saw how little the slice was.  What did they do? Shave a bit off from the factory portion?? I was paying for my takeout order and another customer started talking to me about the bad food there.  I told her about my brown guacamole and bad service.  The cashier said, ""Well you could have ordered a salad.  At least those are good.""

154,Richard M.,"Columbia, MD",41,17,6.0,3.0,2015-08-05,"So, my whole family loves The Cheesecake Factory. I have fallen in love with cheesecake since I first tried it in college and am now on a goal to make up for all of the opportunities I have missed out prior to my awakening. That being said, this onetime shining star of quality cuisine and service has become tarnished...at least at this location. First, the cheesecake is amazing and at this point no one can even question that. It is rich and creamy and without a doubt heavens streets are paved with it. This is also the only reason it get 3 stars. However, the service is no longer stellar. At a recent visit our waitress with 5 tables and only 3 filled was horrible. I ordered soup that was horrible, more on that later, and it sat in front of me for a good 10 minutes before she ever appeared to see if we were okay. She apologised for the food and took it off the bill but still. Then my friend ordered a pasta dish and waited about ten minutes to get some olive oil and cheese. She asked for no sauce and olive oil when she ordered. This is also not the first time, a week prior we waited 20 minutes for soup, hmmm maybe it is the soup, before the waitperson returned to say it would be another 30 minutes for soup. What? Now the food. Let's talk about the Chicken Tortilla Soup I ordered as an appetiser. Normally, The Cheesecake Factory has amazing soups...normally. This soup was wretched. First, it was more like day old oatmeal then soup in both consistency and taste than soup. Seriously canned soup would have been better. The taste was mealy and had the overwhelming taste of Corn Masa. There was no chicken to be found in the Chicken Tortilla Soup and it was garnished with a pool of grease and some corn. And the smell!  Even the patrons next to us were offended.  The Main dishes were good, although not as tasty as you would think. I had the combo Steak Diane and Chicken Marsala. The Steak Diane was wonderful but under seasoned. The Chicken Marsala was excellent but the Mashed Potatoes were cold clumpy and not good at all. Between the poor service and the not so great food, I feel like this once amazing establishment is on the decline. I will speak to a manager and try them again in a few months and update my review, but until then I would recommend take out cheesecake and dining some place else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=120,2.88,2.93,2.93,2.572,2.91

She did and immediately went to get the GM.  It took him a few minutes to come over. While we were waiting my husband vomit in the bathroom.  The GM finally came over and I told him that there was a roach in my food and to look it - he refused and said he believed me.  I demanded my money back.  He was looking for the receipt.  I was so distraught that I couldn't even find the receipt.  We explained that we were just there less than 20 minutes ago so you would think it would have been easy to find our order.  While he's searching for the receipt - I explained that we were frequent patrons of the CF and had never experienced such a disgusting and nasty incident as this.  He said in all his 8 years of working at CF that he had never experienced anything like it either.  He was apologetic and offered free food and dessert.  Really?  Are you serious? I wouldn't even want a glass of water from this darn place!  I was so disgusted - just the image of the roach in my food and to think that I may have eaten one - made me nausea that I went to the restroom and threw up!  When I came back out, hubby was holding his head down - not feeling well at all.  Not to mention we were late for the concert at this point and had to decide whether to go or forfeit the $200+ that we spent on tickets.  We went on to the concert - although we really couldn't enjoy it because I couldn't help but think about the incident. I contacted the health department and they are investigating the incident.  Now I am completely turned off from eating at any restaurant.  It took me awhile to eat after the incident because I couldn't get the image out of my head of the roach crawling on my food.  I couldn't sleep that well either.  This incident has forced me to cook my own food from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=240,2.8,2.93,2.93,2.34,2.878

Anyways, first off, slow service, while the waiters are courteous, being such a huge restaurant with many tables, it's impossible to catch the attention of a worker, especially so when I'm seated at the booth where the cursory look of the waiter will most like zip right past your upraised hand, either that or the waiter just turns around and walks out of the lane of tables that they are waiting because you were seated right in the middle of that corridor, like how I was with my family. Waitress got my order wrong, had to wait another 25 mins after the rest of the food came to even taste any of my food. Eggplant Parmesean lunch item, they gave me chicken parm btw. And when I it came to the bill, realized they charged me for the dinner value of the parm when I asked for the lunch version. Brought this up with my waitress, says that they charged me the dinner parm because that's what they gave me, messed up the order here again as you can see, told her my stance of how I'm not paying for their mistake, which St that point she told me she will bring this issue up with er manager. Truthfully, felt a bit insulted that they thought to charge me the whole value of any meal item considering the rest of my table was done with their food and waited another 15 minutes or so while I start munching on my food when it arrived. It's the little things, but service is the bread and butter of any restaurant, regardless of being an independent restaurant or a franchise. Regardless, food is mediocre, and the rush job on my food at this point left me with a eggplant dish still a little more raw in the center than it should be, and pasta that had not taken the extra 5 secs to properly coat with the pesto. Had bunches of just plain noodle uncoated staring at me. Know I'm being a repetitive, but the small things that you overlook is what cost you in anything you do.

We ordered the Thai lettuce wraps as an appetizer which was good. His factory burrito came out looking like an enchilada more than a burrito. Which is still fine. My fettuccine Alfredo came out. I took a small bite. I eat very salty.. But this wasn't even edible. Too damn salty. The server asked if I wanted Parmesan cheese which I responded yes then realized how damn stay it was and said no the pasta is salty as it is. She said oh should I get them to remake it and I said it was fine because I didn't want to be too annoying. At that exact moment I found pieces of broccoli in my pasta. This pasta doesn't come with broccoli... Which I then slightly moved the spoon (the spoon that comes on the side with all pasta dishes) guess what I found? A piece of withered leafy green. And it was a big one too. Lost my appetite. The server watched me unveil that SOB too. She was disgusted too. Did what she could, offered me a new one, a different dish, etc. but do you think I really want to eat after seeing that? I know I went in 40 minutes before closing time but isn't that ridiculous? I didn't even complain. Like who knows where those broccoli bits and withered leafy green came from?! From another dish? Maybe the plate itself was dirty? Was the spoon dirty? Was it even washed? Were they cleaning the back, getting ready to go and those bits happened to fly into my dish?! I don't know!! Yeah. No thanks. The manager came over saying ""oh I looked at your dish. What was wrong with it..?"" Lol I just looked at her and then explained what I had found in it.. She just offered a new dish to which I declined. That's it. Shitty management. Server did what she could. They took off the Alfredo off the bill. Obviously. Was totally disgusted. Definitely not acceptable.

I always call in ahead of time and order, then walk in to pick it up. i do this routinely now because i cannot trust them to bring my food to the car since i know it will most likely be wrong. they can never remember to give me the extra dressing i ask for. this particular time, instead of forgetting, they drenched the salad with dressing and put extra on the side! ummm..... this is CARRY OUT!!! by the time i go to where i was going, the salads would be mushy!!! dressing always goes on the side for carry-outs. then my salads came with iceberg, which i specifically asked for no iceberg, since they are kale & spinach salads. not sure when they started to make it look fuller by throwing in iceberg. i'm paying for kale and spinach, so that's what i should get. sad i have to request it, then still dont get it! they like to fill the container 25-40% so i always have to show them i noticed, and ask for more. crazy thing is, a lady standing next to me asked the manager if he took anything off my bill for all my trouble and he said no... she just stared at him (LOL) and then he walked away as fast as he could!!!!!! the employee named Gabby, saw/heard it, so she offered me a free piece of cheesecake! SHE is the only reason i calmed down. its sad an employee needs to do the managers job! and he is the SAME guy who has dealt with my wrong orders before and NEVER offers to compensate. i will get his name next time so i can post here. p.s.

There were numerous open tables, and the hostesses were steadily seating guests; keeping the wait times minimal and not overwhelming the waitstaff.  We ordered 3 courses: appetizers, sandwiches and of course cheesecake. Our Fried Mac and Cheese was tasty but a little cool at the center. Both sandwiches we ordered were delicious and huge. We could only eat half and have the rest boxed. Our cheesecakes, to go, were also great. Our service by Kumba was the highlight of the evening. Her timing and service were outstanding. We never needed anything but we didn't feel bothered. She was very friendly and warm and made us feel welcome. We plan on asking for her when we return and recommend that you do the same.

I ordered the Southern fried chicken sliders, which are four mini sliders (""mini"" is relative) with lettuce, tomato, pickle, and two sauces on the side (mayo and tangy chipotle ranch). The chicken was cooked well, not overdone, and was flavorful and fresh. The lettuce and tomatoes were fresh and complemented the meal well. The pickles were way too many for the four sliders, so you're in for a treat if you're a pickle fan. The portion size is large enough for one person.  Leave room for dessert!

I have always felt that the service in this location was somewhat lacking but my last visit has solidified that. First, my spouse and I were seated in a very small corner table. With my spouse being 6'7 it was ridiculous that the hostess would even place us at the table when he literally would not be able to sit comfortably. We asked for a separate table and were placed directly next to the kitchen. This was not ideal and wasn't understandable as we arrived at around 9:30pm and the restaurant wasn't busy. We asked to be moved again and we're seated in a spacious booth next to the window viewing the outdoor seating. Everything was going well and our food came out quickly. However, I looked out the window and saw an enormous RAT. I was completely disgusted and lost my appetite. I told our waitress and she did not seem to think it was a problem.

This place is everything I hate about chain restaurants, from the terrible food, to the insane prices, and it's constantly packed. I was in here the other day just to get a drink before a movie and the bar was packed with people waiting for tables and they had only 2 bartenders serving the entire restaurant, I felt really bad for them because they seemed like they were doing a good job and really trying. Unfortunately there was a stuck up lady at the bar who kept tapping the bar like she was at a blackjack table and sighing because her drink wasn't getting filled fast enough. I literally only went in here because they closed Uno's and Chammps (not that I like those places either) and there wasn't a closer bar nearby to grab a drink.

I was disappointed but went to the counter and told to her to bring 4 different slices...it took her another 30 minutes and no one was there! I got up and asked for the manager again..Lauren came again and I explained her the whole story and how disappointed I was....

Food: Veggie burger was good.  This is one of the reasons I go to Cheesecake Factory, different location.  Tomatoes were fresh, pickles were fine.  Lettuce, though moist, looked more like left over bits of shredded lettuce for tacos.  Husband's bacon burger was alright.  He ordered medium well, but he got something that was pink.  Could have sent it back but the afternoon had already been long.  We ordered our lunch.  After a while, Waiter came out and explained that there was a delay of the veggie burger.  His manager was working on it.  Waiter also apologized that the before meal bread had not arrived. He said (this was the third time) that he was still waiting for it to get finished baking.   The manager came out with the sandwiches, apologized and said the fries were on their way.  I did express (soft tones) our frustration at the wait.  He just kind of looked at us.   Shortly there after a member of the kitchen team came out with a lovely servings of sweet potato fries.  They were hot and good.  She was friendly.  She wanted to know if we wanted some of the pre-meal bread when it was done.  We passed.

Our waitress was Paige Z and she was very friendly and patient with us as we decided on what we wanted. I typically only order the Louisiana chicken pasta and wanted to try something different but I settled on that since it was familiar. My mom had no idea what she wanted, so we asked Paige what she liked and she recommended the Bang bang chicken and shrimp, so my mom decided to give it a try.  She brought out a bread basket containing only wheat bread (which we requested) and immediately noticed that the bread was burnt. Not slightly overcooked- burnt ( the whole backside of the bread was black couldn't be cut with a knife). Surely the person who burnt the bread knew it was burnt and still decided to place it in a basket, probably hoping we wouldn't notice. We made Paige aware of the burnt bread and she brought us a new basket 10 minutes later.  While trying to cut the bread I noticed that the entire handle of my knife was dirty! I looked at the other silverware on the table and some of the forks were dirty too :(  I didn't want to make a big deal out of it, so I asked for a glass of hot water and we soaked the utensils in the water and wiped them off. When the food came, everything looked great. I go to eat my pasta and its cold. It wasn't warm as if it had been sitting on the line for a few minutes, it was COLD. I was so disappointed because I always get this meal and it usually comes out just right. Again, not wanting to make a big deal out of it, I just ate it as is. My mom told me to just eat her food down her and I could just heat mine up and take it for lunch the next day. Her meal was AMAZING (hence the 4 stars despite all that went wrong). It was hot and as delicious as Paige said it would be.

Very busy night and because they don't do reservations, the wait was super long - about an hr and 5-10 min before we were finally seated. We ordered appetizers as we were drinking while the other 2 in our party ordered entrees -- ** Egg roll sampler -- this we loved! Delicious and flavorful!! ** Salmon Rolls -- it was alright though I feel it could be better. The salmon was dry and a little bland. ** Buffalo Chicken wings -- good! I ordered this without the sauce because I was craving fried chicken wings and this was pretty straightforward - juicy, flavorful and good! ** Dynamite shrimp -- this was NOT good!! Shrimp was overly breaded, no flavor and there was nothing dynamite about the sauce at all!! ** Grilled Steak Medallions (ordered to be shared as appetizer) -- I was kind of iffy about ordering steak here and the rest of the party advised I shouldn't  since its not a streak place but I went ahead and ordered it since I was craving steak. I ordered the steak medium rare but when they brought it out it was from medium to mostly well done (not happy about that). The flavor was OK but upset about how the steak was cooked (not medium rare)! Should've listened to everyone! ** Country Salad -- Good salad!! Didn't taste the entrees of the other 2 in the party so won't add those to the review... My final take on here -- food was sub par, mediocre (not including the desserts).

But the idea of going there on that day to meet your 3 and 6 year old daughters to celebrate and open up more than 20 gifts, is nothing short of a nightmare.  Thankfully, I came up with the idea of trying to find a restaurant that would reserve a small area in a back corner where we could sit down, open gifts, and enjoy ourselves briefly.  After a few unsuccessful requests to other restaurants, I finally called The Cheesecake Factory and spoke to one of their Managers names Zach (or Zack? I'll refer to him as Z from now on so I don't spell his name wrong haha), and without hesitation he agreed to reserve a place for us.  As luck would have it, Z was also scheduled to be the opening manager that day, and made sure I knew to come directly to him if I ran into any issues.  Now, if anyone has ever been to Cheesecake Factory, they are pretty strict about their reservation policy.  I even called two other CF locations to see if they'd agree to it, and they both said no. Z probably has no idea how much this means to me, or how much better he's making my daughters Christmas, but it's hard to explain how truly grateful I am to find someone that cares more about doing the right thing instead of going by ""policy"" and saying no.  I figured the least I could do is write some reviews to say thank you.  So thanks Z!  You just gave me the best Christmas gift I could ever receive!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=20,2.88,2.74,2.856,,2.7960000000000003
206,Susan D.,"Alexandria, VA",148,22,25.0,3.0,2017-12-28,"I have frequented the Tysons Corner and Durham, NC locations often and this experience was just okay in comparison. I ordered the hibachi steak which came out cold to the touch. The server took the dish away to set it under a heat lamp while my boyfriend continued to finish his entire meal. The plate came back scalding hot and the food was at this point dried out. I very much regretted stepping out of my comfort zone of chicken at this restaurant. Our server, Kumba, was very kind. The peppermint cheesecake was again just okay. For a slightly expensive date night and considering I wanted my boyfriend's first experience at Cheesecake to be amazing... everything was just okay. I expected so much more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia,2.96,2.72,2.852,,2.8160000000000003

We headed to the bar and ordered our drinks along with nacho, chicken burrito and for dinner I ordered veggie burger . It was amazing and healthy too. Patty was made of brown rice :) must try for all vegetarians!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia,3.08,2.74,2.848,,2.8760000000000003
