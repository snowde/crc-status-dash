183,Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3081,6377,5213.0,4.0,2012-05-29,"For a chain restaurant I would give it 5 stars but overall a solid 4 stars. We hadn't been to Cheesecake Factory in years (last time in Beveryly Hills, CA) and didn't remember it being anything special. This time we had a gift card and were shopping at Easton and figured to give it another chance. We got there monday at 5 with minimal wait and once we saw the happy hour menu decided to sit at the bar. Service was very nice and super fast, we were on an out in an hour. The prices are steep for a chain restaurant, there was no way I was going to pay $25+ for some fish so once I saw they have a housemade veggie burger I had to give it a try. It was pretty good, not as good as Northstar or some others but descent. The house sald with ginger soy super yummy, best dressing ever! We got a bunch of $5 plates the guys favorite was the mac n cheese balls, the burger sliders were also pretty good, the chicken sliders ok but not much chicken, really more bread and breading than anything else. The tex mex egg rolls were fine, I loved the avocado spread with it. The chicken potstickers were also good. Portions for apps were pretty big, you get alot more than at any other restaurant we've been to and for $5 a good deal. I just can't jutify paying $7 for a slice of cake so I've yet to try that but I did stand there and drool for a few minutes....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus?start=100,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.9280000000000004,3.3200000000000003

The one in Easton is very nice. The decorations are kind of Egyptian meets Aztec-ish. The wait time varies. In the evenings on weekends, when Easton is packed, there is usually a 2 hour wait (and they do not take reservations). But if you go on off hours there is hardly any wait at all. The service can be either amazing or disappointing depending on how busy they are. But never mind the service, the food is always amazing! My favorite entree is the Teriyaki Chicken (which comes with grilled pineapple and bananas on the side - Yum). The Cheescake menu spans 2 pages and there are so many different types. But my favorite deserts on the menu are the Tiramisu and Original Cheesecake w/cherry topping.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus?start=160,3.36,3.36,3.36,3.024,3.3600000000000003

My favorite way to dine here is to order a bottle of their house Cabernet (around $30), split one of the bigger appetizer salads (~$10) and then a few small plates to share (ranging from $4-$8). It's for sure enough to share between 2 people and we leave feeling great - not uncomfortably full with 3 pounds of leftovers in a to-go bag.  Service is usually pretty great and no one seems to mind a couple of people enjoying a leisurely shared dinner, even on a  semi-busy night.

131,Trevor B.,"Grove City, OH",0,1,,2.0,2012-12-04,"My wife and I have been searching for a place that offers the classic Eggs Benedict.  Since The Cheesecake Factory offers this item on their Sunday Brunch menu, we decided to give it a try on 12/2/2012.  I couldn't have been more disappointed.  My wife ordered French Toast and bacon, and I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Canadian Bacon and Hollandaise sauce.  After an extremely long wait for our food to arrive (it wasn't crowded or busy at 10 AM), my wife was presented with her French Toast, but no bacon.  Apparently, the bacon was not ready.  The worst offense was my Eggs Benedict was presented with a greasy and broken Hollandaise sauce.  When our waitress came back to ask if everything was okay, I informed her that my dish had to go back to the kitchen.  She didn't ask why, and picked it up and returned to the kitchen.  I did overhear her saying the sauce was broken, so at least our waitress knew the dish was unacceptable.  What I can't fathom is why the kitchen would send such a disaster out to the table in the first place.  The second attempt was no better than the first.  The sauce was again broken.  Apparently, there was no chef working that had passed basic sauces at culinary school.  Now here is the absolute worst offense.  As I had been craving Eggs Benedict, I decided to eat the second dish as I was also hungry and didn't want to waste further time having them fix me something else.  During my meal, I was presented with a flour-thickened Hollandaise sauce.  That should have been criminal!  It isn't called Hollandaise GRAVY, it's supposed to be an emulsification!  That had to be the worst offense from the kitchen.  Needless to say, the manager did remove the Eggs Benedict from the check - I wouldn't have paid for it anyway.  The service was good. The waitress was sympathetic.  The transgressions on the kitchen were unforgivable.  We had been past fans of The Cheesecake Factory, but after this experience, we won't be going back.  I cannot suffer a kitchen that just doesn't care about the quality of the food they are producing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus?start=180,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.9520000000000004,3.2000000000000006

This one is located inside Easton Town Center and perhaps that is why it is so hard to get good service. We had a group of about 10 and had to wait almost 40 minutes for a table. We actually only got seated after talking to the manager. Once we were seated, they were pretty quick taking the orders and bringing us some complimentary apps, however it took a long time for us to get the entrees... a one hour lunch ended up taking us 3 hours. The food was fine and as usual the menu is massive. I always have The Navajo sandwich when I go there, fry bread and avocado (you can't hate that). It was good. Parking was torture. People were actually stalking everyone who would leave the shops to see where they were parked and try to get their spot.

133,Kevin C.,"Valparaiso, IN",89,112,263.0,3.0,2013-04-17,"There is really only one word to describe The Cheesecake Factory: M'eh. Judging from the ambiance and prices, this restaurant attempts to market itself as a sophisticated, up-scale dining option. What this restaurant achieves superficially, it missed the mark in substance. Unfortunately, there isn't much about this place that would commend itself to those seeking an enjoyable night out - especially considering what you'll end up paying.  On the few occasions I've eaten here, it has always been exceedingly crowded regardless of the day. On my most recent visit, my wife and I were packed into a row of tables like sardines. We ended sitting elbow-to-elbow with a group of rambunctious, Australian muscle-heads who spent the evening bragging about their most recent DUIs. The whole restaurant was extremely loud (Australians notwithstanding) so much so that we could barely carry on a private conversation.  The food was overall very average. The offerings and quality are about what you might expect from TGI Fridays, just 50% more expensive. The service was okay, and the wait times were a bit longer than what you'd like. The only reason I bumped this review up to 3 stars was because of the cheesecake. In this realm, they certainly live up to their reputation. The variety and overall deliciousness of the dessert menu was the evening's saving grace. But, you can always just buy a cheesecake to go, and skip the unwanted invasions on your wallet and personal space.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus?start=120,3.04,3.04,3.04,3.2120000000000006,3.0400000000000005

I had this issue with this place. I LOVE this place but this location wasn't as good as what I remember back east. The wait at 6pm was an hour and half so we walked over to barnes and noble and browsed, which is always nice for a mall restaurant... there's distractions. When our names were called we noticed the wait went up to 3 hours. THAT IS NUTS!!! I don't care how good the cheesecake is, 3 hours is NUTS!!  So we get in at about 7:30 and our waitress took a considerable amount of time to get to us and was in a rush the whole night, often forgetting we asked for things like napkins or more bread. She needed a break to say the least....badly! The bread that was on the table was stale; like 2 days ago type stale. For an app we all shared the buffalo blasts (Chicken, Cheese and Our Spicy Buffalo Sauce all Stuffed in a Spiced Wrapper and Fried until Crisp. Served with Celery Sticks and Blue Cheese Dressing) which was tasty... a lot tastier then I thought they would be. The dipping sauce was bad though. They didn't go together at all.  I ordered the chicken romano (Breast of Chicken Coated with a Romano-Parmesan Cheese Crust. Served with Pasta w/ Tomato Sauce.)  It was 2 flattened pieces of dried out chicken with panko bread crumbs (tasted no cheese) with a huge (like 4 servings) of pasta with a creamy red sauce. The sauce was good but there was barely any at all on the pasta and the chicken was drier then a boot so I asked for more sauce not wanting to send the food back; it took long enough to get to us the first time. The hubby got some kind of pasta and had the same issue I did; didn't realize what he was ordering and it came out dry and without much sauce. We both asked for more sauce which came out quick.  Dad got a salad which was large, but not enough food for a man in his eyes. He didn't say much else about it apart from complaining about prices for bad food. My mom order mac and cheese, which came out deep fried. She was horrified by the calories but her face showed she was in heaven.  The reason we go back is the cheesecake. I got the red velvet cheese cake this time. My favorite so far, although their blueberry cheese cake is so heavenly that I may have two favorites. Then again, every new flavor I try ends up being my new favorite so oh well. Mom got a huge piece of carrot cake and dam near licked the plate clean. I think next time I'll just go back for apps and cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus?start=140,3.08,3.08,3.08,3.2120000000000006,3.0800000000000005

We wanted outside so we could enjoy the beautiful weather and people watch the Easton Art Festival goers. We got exactly what we wanted. With an excellent waiter and cocktails to boot.  I had the chicken parm sandwich which was pretty tasty. The boyfriend had the luau salad which was massive and incredibly good. And, when I say massive, I meant it... it was 3 stories high. For drinks, I skipped the wine and went with J.W.'s pink lemonade which tasted exactly like pink lemonade despite being entirely alcohol.

68,Neal W.,"Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY",158,139,26.0,2.0,2013-07-27,"Here are the top six things you should know before visiting The Cheesecake Factory in Easton (or any Cheesecake Factory, really): 1.) This place is always seems to be pretty busy, but I can't seem to understand why. My excuse was that I had a gift certificate, but I imagine most people are choosing to send their dining dollars to Cheesecake Factory over one of the local great restaurants they could discover through Yelp. 2.) They're obviously known for their large portions, and the food is actually pretty good, but everything tastes good when it's made with two sticks of butter and topped with cheddar cheese. The menu is also very large, which would be good if you're with a bunch of picky eaters, but it was honestly a bit overwhelming and hard to figure out which items would be the best choices. 3.) The decor in this place seems to be having some identity issues. There seemed to be Mediterranean, Egyptian, Italian, French, and possibly Jersey Shore influence in the design. Again, it seems like they're trying to have as many concepts as possible to please everyone, but it just comes off strange and identity-less. 4.) The prices are a little high, but I guess many find comfort knowing that they are going to get a decent meal and plenty of leftovers. 5.) The service is pretty good. No complaints from my visit.  6.) By the end of our meal we were stuffed, but since it's The Cheesecake Factory, we felt obligated to get a slice (plus cheesecake is delicious). We got a piece of chocolate mousse cheesecake to go and it tasted great. For being called The Cheesecake Factory, that does seem to be where their strength is. If I had a craving I could see myself stopping back in to get a slice, but I wouldn't come back for the rest of the menu.

However, many don't know of their Sunday Brunch-that's right, Sunday Brunch.  One of the cool things about Yelping is hearing something many don't know about, hopping on here and sharing that info. Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. Sorry, I was rambling so I jumped straight to it. This is my favorite item on their brunch menu. Pancakes? Yes. So what. So what?

This is definitely my favorite entree-period. I have also had their Chicken & Avocado sandwich that comes with french fries.  This sandwich, my friends, is super tasty.  When I first ordered this I was slightly leary of the combination, but don't be hesitant like I was.  Jump into it full force because it is the shiznit. My husband gets their shrimp bistro pasta.  He says it has a great flavor to it and he orders this every time we go.  I CANNOT vouch for this because I will NEVER taste it, because as most of you know you eat with your eyes first and something about this dish just appears unappealing to me and I refuse to put a bite of it anywhere near my mouth.  Sorry, I'm just weird like that. I have tasted their pizza, it's mighty good too.  My kids have gotten their chicken fingers on MANY occasions, and they always gobble them up with a quickness. Their brown bread is soft, and just plain good.  We always ask for all brown bread when we go here because we are not big fans of the harder sourdough bread (they can keep that stuff). Now to my favorite part. What they are known best for...CHEESECAKE!  I have tried so many I don't even know where to start.  I will tell you my absolute favorite is the lemon raspberry one.  It is so light and fluffy and not as heavy as most of the other flavors.  Others I have tried that are fabulous as well are,  Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple, Ultimate Red Velvet, Oreo (the regular one is good, the chocolate oreo one is gross--tell them no thank you on that one), Chocolate Tuxedo (yuk--avoid this one too), White Chocolate Blueberry, Carmel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake, and I am sure there are many other.  All of the cheesecakes I have tasted (other than the ones listed with bad comments beside them) and been wonderful. I would recommend this spot for a friends night out or a family outing.  Either way, you will get good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus?start=60,3.64,3.64,3.64,3.2840000000000003,3.6400000000000006

The phrase jack of all trades master of none does not apply to Cheesecake Factory because everything they do, they do well. From appetizer to dessert it is can't miss.

My favorite menu item has actually been of the menu for years, but as sad as that is, I can always drown out the memory with an appetizer, entree and dessert. And of course, cheesecakes are their namesake, and the have about a billion to choose from. But seriously, the list is 50+ cheesecakes of which I've probably had between 10-15. My favorite is the Red Velvet and it is not so rich that I can't eat it in a single sitting. Some cheesecakes, like the Godiva or Tuxedo are too rich not to be spread out over the next day or so. The Linda's Fudge Cake is always a good choice if you opt not to go the cheesecake route. The one downside is that this place is always packed during peak hours but it is worth the wait.

So against our better judgement, we signed up for a large group dinner at a restaurant that doesn't accept reservations. Knowing that there will be a wait, we arrived well ahead of the group at 4:30 to put our name in for our 12-person table. We were advised that a large group had just sat down at 4:30 so that it will be a 2 hour wait. Apparently they designate one specific set of seats at this restaurant for large groups, so we had the wait for the group before us to leave.  Never mind that this is a huge restaurant and could have placed us elsewhere if they'd actually tried. We literally saw over a 100 people seated before us after all. Unfortunately for us, the large group that they allowed to seat before us at the only table we were allowed to sit at was not a complete party, and it apparently took them an hour to even order since not everyone had arrived when they seated this group ahead of us.  So we waited and waited and waited. For 3 hours in the end. It could've been 2.5 hrs but they didn't want to hurry the group occupying our table apparently...

19,Jessica L.,"Columbus, OH",9,133,373.0,4.0,2016-05-23,"This poor girl has been on a ""healthy-living journey"" for a year and a half now (I've lost 200 pounds!) so when my birthday rolled around this year, I wanted to be REAL bad. So of course I picked the Cheesecake Factory, America's biggest guilty pleasure.  We went on a Friday at about 2:00pm since this location gets crazy packed on Saturday and Sunday and we quickly got a table for 2. Since I knew I was going to eat a slice of cheesecake with an entire days worth of calories and fat grams, we decided to order the chicken samosas appetizer from the Skinnylicious menu. They were amazing! Full of spiced meat and lightly fried but not dripping in grease. The dipping sauce was great too, so we were very pleased with this low-calorie app.  For my meal I ordered the sausage & ricotta flatbread also from the Skinnylicious menu, and my husband had the Cuban sandwich. When they delivered our meals I'm not gonna lie: I was totally jealous of the huge, crusty sandwich my husband received. It looked so unbelievably good! He said it was delicious even though he prefers softer bread (I like it firm and crusty so this looked perfect to me). My flatbread was listed as a small plate and it definitely was small, but it was pretty awesome. The sausage was finely ground and tasted great and the ricotta and kale combo was so tasty. A small dish that packed a ton of flavor, so I was a happy girl. Now, the REAL reason we visited this place...the cheesecake.

There was absolutely no way we had been called since we had not left the area. Since we had supposedly missed our call, the lady told us that we would then be ""put back into the rotation."" We didn't know what that meant, but soon found out. The next name called was that of a couple who came after us. The next name was another couple after us. We got the idea.  At that point we decided that a table for us could not be found and that our business was not desired.  We got up to walk out and once they saw us leaving, they quickly called our name, but we continued to walk out.  We took a short walk to PF Changs, walked directly in, was immediately waited on and had a great meal.

92,Ally T.,"Blacklick, OH",0,1,,1.0,2016-10-10,"I have eaten at this easton cheesecake factory many times- and each time we had great service until last night. I have been a server for the past 5 years, so I know when another server says the same B.S lines to me and I know they messed up. I understand that mistakes happen, things in the kitchen can get crazy, people run food they weren't suppose to.  i get it. But our server never apologized during the meal and neither did management.  it took almost 10 minutes- once again if she would have apologized in her greet ""thank you so much for your patience this evening I'm Tianna""- i get it. full section. running around. nothing.  It took quiet awhile after that to receive our drinks...1 ice water and 3 unsweetened ice teas.  *do the servers/management at cheesecake factory not help one another when they are slammed?*  when she finally came back to us we gave her our full order- apps and all.  this is where the service and management failed.  Our appetizers never came because our entree's came out first. two other servers ran our dinner out in which we asked what happened to our appetizers. They were being plated. Our server didn't come over to say ""I am so sorry!"" nadda. The manager who I assume was running the line that evening came over right when our food was dropped off to inform us that our appetizers were coming out, in which we said no. we had our dinner. no thanks. He honestly didn't looked surprised that she messed up. But no apology just a ""I'll take those off the check for you"" and walked away.  we were half way done with our meal when our server came back to see how everything was tasting-no mention of the appetizers mix up. dropped off the bread that we had asked for when we ordered our food over 20 minutes prior....filled up drinks and walked away and didn't come back until we boxed up our food.  we all ordered a cheesecake, my boyfriend a cup of coffee. My friends across from me said ""yes, two pumpkin cheesecakes because we don't share""- she misunderstood, this I wasn't as mad because I once again understand that it's loud and the other cheesecake came out somewhat quicker *I understand you have to rush the order* - since only three cheesecakes came out not 4. but my boyfriend never got his coffee. no apology.  so we paid and hung out in the booth- we were actually ok with how everything happened for our meals. we haven't see each other and it was actually my friends taking me and my boyfriend out as my boyfriends belated birthday present to us from them. well needless to say... I caught our server and another server at a terminal staring at us- I can only speculate that they were sh** talking us because she saw her 10% tip, but they made it pretty obvious, my jaw dropped. Go to the back ladies.  Our server did apologize once though- at the end after we paid about the appetizers but it wasn't sincere, quick, and she promptly walked away.  I was just going to write this off as one bad trip, as I've gone before and my service was great- I wasn't going to write a review but the last straw was when our server came back to us to ask us why she received such a bad tip..which is that cheesecake factory policy? because...it should have been obvious- well my friend that paid went on to explain why she received a bad tip- about how the appetizers, the coffee- she tried to say she can't control when the food comes out- which is somewhat true-but in this circumstance no. I don't know if you use micros or aloha but any server knows not to put appetizers and pasta in at the same time- as most places you have the pasta pre-cooked so all you have to do is deep fry the chicken, toss in the sauce and plate them- so yeah they cook way faster than all of the appetizers we ordered. She either put them in at the same time or  way too close to one another- like she rang them in less then five minutes later. Management never came back either to check on us. honestly we could have solved this problem if management would have been better and expressed ANY apologies but none. I hope next time I go back this issues will be resolved with service and management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus?start=80,3.0,3.23,3.23,2.5960000000000005,3.138

Our service was great, and the food was fabulous.  We shared a  1/2 sandwich with each other so we could try them both out, but we only ended up eating  1/2 of our own sandwich as we were full.  We both enjoyed our sandwiches and French fries and mentioned how tasty and fresh the ingredients were and the crispiness of the French fries.

Either way, I had the cashew chicken with brown rice, extra spicy. The sauce was more toward sweet than spicy, but still good. If you like spicy food, I would recommend emphasizing that when you order. For an appetizer, we had the corn tamales. I would not really call them corn tamales. They were more like a sweet corn cake, but they were still good. Everyone at the table seemed pleased with what they ordered.  Now for the best part, the cheesecake. Order the cheesecake.

Ordered the anti-oxidant salad, here is the description:  A Delicious Blend of Salad Greens, Spinach, Kale, Avocado, Broccoli, Grapes, Roasted Pear, Blueberries, Onion, Sunflower Seeds and Almonds with Lemon-Blueberry Vinaigrette. Sounds appetizing right???  NOT.  This was basically a blend of salad greens.  I requested no avocado or almonds.  There were NO blueberries at all.  There were all of 8 grapes cut in half, the roasted pear was diced so tiny that as I was eating I remembered it was supposed to have pear and I had to dig for these miniscule pieces that basically added no flavor to all that kale and spinach.  There was also no broccoli in the salad!  The ONLY good thing was the dressing.  If I'd wanted a kale & spinach salad I would've ordered that!   Anyone whose ever been to the Cheesecake Factory knows they give large portion.  So I had this huge takeout of basically spinach & kale with a few sunflower seeds, grapes & diced pears with fabulous dressing.  Once AGAIN - I will not go to the cheesecake factory for the next 30 years.  Maybe they will improve by then.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus,3.0,3.2,3.2,2.3120000000000003,3.1200000000000006

When the food came 30 minutes later we noticed the food tasted like coffee. Both of the small metal carafes that were supposed to be filled with syrup were filled with black coffee instead! Needless to say both of our meals were ruined when we poured coffee over our food. When I told the waiter about the problem he said that I ordered it that way. What??? I have never even heard of pouring coffee over lemon pancakes let alone ordering coffee to pour over my 11 year old's French toast.

A waffle, two scrambled eggs and bacon was the last to arrive. At least it was hot when it came. So if you plan to eat together, good luck because not everyone will get their food together.  My meal was pretty good. Still warm by the time we all had our food. It was pretty standard Benedict. Nothing to write home about.  One friend got the eggs, toast and bacon and they forgot the bacon. The friend with the waffle had to send it back because it was borderline over cooked. Another friend got the brioche breakfast sandwich and the last friend got the monte cristo. Both sandwiches looked sloppy and haphazard. The monte cristo was not a typical monte cristo, not what you normally would think of and she wasn't pleased with it.  $3.25 for standard drip coffee and a breakfast I can get at the corner spot in a suburb would have been better.

We got a nice 2-seater table away for any window - good so we could warm up.  Our waitress was super nice and attentive.  Overall, they did a good job keeping our drinks filled (we got a different waitress half way through our time there - weird.)   Hubby ordered the chicken chipotle pasta dish.  He had ordered it before and remembered it being good.  This meal lived up to his recollection and was very good (EMPTY PLATER). I ordered the Skinnylicious chopped chicken salad dish - dressing on the side.  I think I got what I ordered (no dressing - ever.  but it was fine without).  I question whether it was actually a Skinnylicious under 590 calorie dish as it was SO GOOD.  There was plenty of flavorful bacon and crumbled bleu cheese, as well as chicken, avocado and corn.  It was a huge serving.  I just have trouble believing it was Skinnylicious.  Regardless, I ate EVERY SINGLE BITE OF IT!  I posted a photo - check it out.  You can see al the cheese and the pile of shredded greens. The only very  minor complaint (although it's more of a strong comment) - was the food seemed to take a while to come out.  Granted we had fresh bread to snack on - so we weren't dying of hunger.  Also, we really weren't in a hurry to go back out in the cold to trek back to the garage for our car.

2,Tom H.,"Westerville, OH",118,301,1994.0,3.0,2017-11-21,"Were you thinking about indulging in a slice of cheesecake while in the area? We were. Just carryout 2 slices. This does not reflect the full menu or dining room. It's the visual mecca of cheesecakes. Bright lighted cases to showcase their delights. A bustling of staff behind the counter, as well as staff from the dining room. They also come to this same area to fill their tables orders for dessert. If I was at a table, I would appreciate my servers aggressive nature of getting my order filled promptly. As a customer who is browsing the case, and ordering, I did not. The personal contact jostling unnecessarily. The loud verbose banter amongst staff about guests. Distracting the cashier taking our order. All things that should be worked on by the front of the house manger. Opening them up at home a short time later, My wife's first comment was, ""Why is yours bigger"". The answer to always remember is ""DIMENSIONS"". CF has their very own cheesecake carryout container. Slices may not be wider or taller than the container.  Her cheesecake was shorter because it was adorned with pretty decorations of treats. The taller the chimney, the lower the roof. This is not the very best cheesecake around. It's as good as most, and is top of the ladder in variety. I have found a food truck that somehow manages to make theirs so smooth and creamy, with a delicate firmness. Toppings vary by day, or specific to custom orders. Now I am forbidden to share the name here, but know that they have the best Sweet Cheese. I'm quite sure many comment on the price. $8/slice Nov 2017 is steep. Especially for average. If you think my review is not accurate, than I am ecstatic that you love your cheesecake experience.

9,Heather R.,"New Albany, OH",59,18,5.0,4.0,2017-12-18,"The food and drinks are are always on point. However, be prepared to wait for about an hour or more on the weekends. The Asian pear martini is really good but a bit on the sweet side. We also got a few apps like the fried Mac and cheese, avocado egg rolls, and the buffalo blasts. All delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus,2.88,2.99,2.99,,2.9459999999999997
1,Heather S.,"Columbus, OH",49,191,59.0,4.0,2017-12-28,"I've always been a fan and probably always will be. I hate waiting to be seated at restaurants and this one is one of the worst. It's so hard to get into 75% of the time.  Their menu is massive. Like ginormous. I've tried several things on the menu, but my go to is always the pasta davinci. The portions are rather large and a to go box is usually necessary. Their appetizers are all good too. Most recently tried the Nashville hot chicken bites and enjoyed those.  I love that ordering dessert here is the norm and is expected. I don't feel like others are judging me as much for being a pig at this restaurant. Sometimes my hubs and l will get a piece of cheesecake for the table and a piece to go for the next day. Everything I've had here has been solid and the service is always okay. Nothing exceptional, but not bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus,2.88,2.99,2.99,,2.9459999999999997

0,Jayme H.,"Columbus, OH",1260,130,381.0,4.0,2018-01-10,"Whenever I think of The Cheesecake Factory I picture Oprah Winfrey singing lyrics to Drake's song Childplay (""This is a place for families that drive Camries and go to Disney"") while slicing pieces of cheesecake for her guests. I have no clue why I picture this in my head, but it does sorta set a stage for what I expect when I plan to visit. It's a very family friendly establishment, it can be rather lavish, and it's pretty much what folks are deeming ""basic"" these days.  Now basic isn't necessarily a bad thing. To me is just means, common or popular.  This specific location of The Cheesecake Factory is right in the middle of Easton shopping center. This means there's a lot of parking surrounding it but depends on the time of year, day, etc. you may have to walk a bit. When you're walking in to give your name to the host, you'll notice a great patio! I always choose to sit outside if the weather is nice. This spot also has a good sized bar and an enormous dining area. It honestly feels never ending. This is a good thing considering how busy this location is. It always seems like there's a line out the door however I never seem to have to wait very long before I'm being taken back to a table.  I feel like the last several times I've visited I've gotten the same waitress. She is a total sweetheart and has definitely been working there for a while. She's always quick to greet the table, take drink orders, bring out bread, and she regularly checks in to make sure everything is going well. Speaking of bread, I love that they always bring out warm, freshly baked bread. Usually sourdough and honey wheat, both fantastic, especially when you're starving! I don't have a go-to menu item when I visit. I tend to try something new each time. I can confidently say that the Almond Crusted Salmon Salad is delicious! Big thumbs up! It comes tossed in a light lemon vinaigrette and it's very refreshing! I also enjoy the Greek salad on the small plate menu, the avocado eggrolls on the appetizer menu, and the pastas are tasty and filling (the portions feel huge). Now, when it comes to down the actual cheesecake, I could go on and on forever. Every single one I've had has been amazing. The white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake is absolutely heavenly. I take a bite and it's pretty close to an outta body experience - no lie. The white chocolate macadamia nut is also a top choice. I love the crunch of the nuts. It gives it some much-needed texture.  Overall, I guess what I'm trying to say is the food and the service has always been pretty good here. Its consistent and consistent is nice and comforting. It's why people visit the same restaurants over and over again. That's likely why I keep coming back to The Cheesecake Factory when I'm hungry and it's near by. While the majority of the time I dine out, I go local, I can make an exception to that rule every now and then.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus,2.84,2.98,2.98,,2.924
