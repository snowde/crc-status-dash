The service was what was truly impressive, especially from a chain. Every time we visited the servers were quick, attentive, and looked like they were happy to be there. I've never seen such consistent service at a chain restaurant. Mind blown. They now have a Skinnylicious menu, which is awesome.The menu has a broad range of items to choose from and comes in good portions. Everything there was good. The exception were the pastas. Pasta came out dry the first time (as if it was sitting under a heat lamp) and cold the second. Ahi tuna salad rocked as did the turkey burger.

282,S W.,"San Francisco, CA",530,356,6.0,4.0,2012-07-10,"In the past, when I thought about the phrase ""Cheesecake Factory"" I immediately thought about a 5,000 calorie meal. Being from California, this was just frightening and I would stay away as much as I could (their addicting brown sugar and French rolls don't help at all, nor do their slushy like drinks)...  And then one day I went with my girlfriend and I saw their ""reduced calorie"" menu--drinks and food both. 100 calorie Mojitos? I got two! Flavorful and refreshing! We split the Asian Chicken Salad (under 400 calories) along with the Miso Salmon with extra sauce (how wrong can you go with fish if you stay away from the white rice, right?!). But since we were already there and saving ourselves just thousands of calories already, we just had to order the (fried) Avocado egg rolls!  The salad was delicious and refreshing--I think it is their dressing that does the trick. The Miso Salmon with extra brown sauce was perfectly glazed and cooked just right - not over done, and not squishy. I also really enjoyed dipping the salmon in the white sauce that the rice sat on. And the avocado egg rolls--- you just can' go wrong with the word ""Avocado"" and the implication of something ""fried"" in the same phrase.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=280,3.52,3.31,3.112,3.536,3.394

Being from California, this was just frightening and I would stay away as much as I could (their addicting brown sugar and French rolls don't help at all, nor do their slushy like drinks)...  And then one day I went with my girlfriend and I saw their ""reduced calorie"" menu--drinks and food both. 100 calorie Mojitos? I got two! Flavorful and refreshing! We split the Asian Chicken Salad (under 400 calories) along with the Miso Salmon with extra sauce (how wrong can you go with fish if you stay away from the white rice, right?!). But since we were already there and saving ourselves just thousands of calories already, we just had to order the (fried) Avocado egg rolls!  The salad was delicious and refreshing--I think it is their dressing that does the trick. The Miso Salmon with extra brown sauce was perfectly glazed and cooked just right - not over done, and not squishy. I also really enjoyed dipping the salmon in the white sauce that the rice sat on.

1024,Amber C.,"Burlingame, United States",94,23,,2.0,2014-04-14,"This is the first (and possibly last) time I have visited this Cheesecake Factory. I'm more familiar with the SF location, and have always had a great experience there. Our names were taken, and after a short wait my friend and I were seated. Our waitress was friendly, and checked in with us (we took a bit of time to get settled and figure out what we want).  When the waitress returned, my friend ordered the Asian Pear Martini, and I a glass of white wine. I ordered the entree Pear and Endive salad, while my friend said she'd like to start with an appetizer salad. Imagine my surprise when my ""entree salad"" came back on a tiny plate. After poking around a bit at my salad, I didn't find any fo the grilled chicken, pear or blue cheese I had expected. My friend discovered there is also an ""Endive Salad"" on the appetizer menu, and, after conferring with the waitress, we discovered there had been a slight mixup. She had thought I wanted the appetizer Endive, not the entree Pear and Endive. An honest mistake, which she readily fixed. The Endive salad was whisked away, and after a bit my Pear and Endive salad was brought out. Here was why I gave this location two stars. The salad was extremely disappointing!!! Let me explain. I'm not a super picky food eater. Something has to be extremely awful or bland for me to dislike it. In general, I love food. But this salad was terribly bland. I could have made a better version at home for half the price. My friend and I soon discovered that the ratios of the meal were completely off. I basically received a bowl of greens with grilled chicken. The salad has almost no dressing on it. I discovered three (three!) TINY hunks of blue cheese at the bottom of my dish, and almost no walnuts. There was also almost no pear. Essentially, I ate through the slightly dry greens, and ended up enjoying about 3 bites worth of properly proportioned greens-extras mix at the bottom of my dish.  This was a huge disappointment. We all go out for dinner expecting a treat, but I ended up enjoying the complimentary bread more than the salad I ordered. I think with the proper mix of ingredients, the taste would be a hit. But this salad was an absolute no go. My friend enjoyed her appetizer salad and salmon though, so I am thrilled she picked something that was done right. She did not like her martini though, because it was very sweet, almost like syrup. The bottom of the martini had a gritty texture from the pear puree. The two stars I give: one for the waitress who was friendly and very attentive. The second: the cheesecake.  The saving grace of this meal was the cheesecake. Our waitress recommended the smores cheesecake, and my friend and I split it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. Holy moly. They even top it with their house-made marshmallow fluff. It truly saved the day. I am still very much on the fence about whether to return to the Cheesecake Factory in Corte Madera again. The location was perfect to meet halfway with my friend for our once-a-month dinner, but my experience was less than thrilling.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=300,3.92,3.53,3.448,2.8240000000000003,3.686

Indeed, when I think about it I have the impression I am talking about a real American landmark. My last visit was awesome, starting with an exceptional service provided by a Ukrainian waitress, I can't remember her name but she was ridiculously adorable and her accent even sweeter than the cheesecake I had for dessert.  My dinner consisted of a small cup of clam chowder and the Bang-Bang chicken and shrimp. I did not like the soup much because it was too heavy but the main course was excellent. I loved the coconut sprinkles with the curry sauce the chicken and shrimp are mixed with.

Well, I just came here with some lady friends and was so disappointed with how small my portion was that I had to complain about it. Luckily the management was great and understood that clearly there was a mistake, but it was such a shame to have to go through all of that when whoever brought the dish to the table should have noticed how small it was or even my waiter didn't notice. The flavors were right on but talk about doing portion control... Still had a nice time, our waiter was lovely and the dessert was superb as usual. I guess my message is, if you are presented with a dish that looks like you could actually finish it, something isn't right and cheesecake if you have decided to drastically cut down on your portions, like half the amount, then please let us as customers know or lower the price of the dish.

I went to the original Cheesecake Factory when it was a small place in Beverly Hills, and they always had OK food at inflated prices. The new restaurants, big and a bit gaudy, always had ridiculously long wait times with no reservations and those stupid beeper things that meant you had to stay within 100 feet when they could be using text messaging to let you know when your table is ready. I had some bad experiences here early on, freezing in the back round room while waiters changed and forgot to bring food, etc. All that said--the food is actually quite good, and almost always enough for two meals--so you can take half home. The menu, of course, is so big that everyone can find something that interests them, italian, mexican, american, asian... vegetarian, cheese, meat, fish... I've yet to have a meal that wasn't good here. Not the very best, but always good. The fish 'n chips are standouts. And this is the big thing--there are very, very few late night restaurants in Marin. Most of the county closes down by 9pm at the latest. The earliest this restaurant closes is 10pm on Sunday nights. Monday through Thursday it's open till 11pm, and Friday's it's midnight. That's when the Cheesecake factory is best--late in the evening. You don't have to fight for parking (not enough mall parking in the day). You don't have to wait for an hour or more for a table as you do during more popular hours. ----- IMPORTANT LATE NIGHT TIP: I went there after a premiere of a movie I co-wrote and act in,   and arrived on a Thursday at 10:50pm.  The man at the front desk told me the kitchen was closed. But it doesn't really close till 11, and with a nice, ""pretty please"" from me he let me sit down, and the waitress was fine with it, as was the kitchen.

We ordered a mozzarella flatbread, and then we each ordered a salad: I got the Asian salad and my boyfriend ordered the Mexican tortilla salad. This is where it all started to go bad. Our waiter came back and told us they were completely out of flatbreads. You would think he might've known. However since he didn't, we changed our order to shrimp spring rolls. They were just okay. Not much shrimp and one of the rolls was not put together properly and just fell apart. Next up was our salads and the waiter came over to ask me if I minded if the dressing was on the salad. I told him of course I minded because I needed to have the dressing on the side as I indicated to him when I ordered. We waited an additional 20 minutes while they redid my salad.

After waiting for our order to be taken, we waited another 45 minutes before our salad and sandwiches were delivered. This was on a slow week night, early, before 6 in the evening. Empty tables all around us. Server nowhere in sight. When we were finished with our entree, the server was not around for dessert order. When we were finished with our meal, I had to stand up and look around for the server, not seeing her, I asked the manager if someone could please bring our check so we could leave. We had very elderly people with us and didn't expect that salad and sandwich would take over two hours from start to finish. Previous visits have been better but over the last six months, we have experienced filthy silverware, tasteless food, incorrect orders and generally bad service. Time to avoid this restaurant. Other restaurants in this chain are superior to this one. Additionally, they were out of soup, out of pumpkin cheesecake and this was the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. Server didn't recommend alternatives, just said without apology, we are ""out."" The vegeburger ordered by two at the table was literally so sloppy it would require a spoon.

The avocado was overly ripe and mushy, and the egg roll shell can best be described as stale. My friend's crab dip came with burnt mini toasts, and the waitress never came around to refill her water.

According to the guide, the Cheesecake Factory has a lot of items that are vegan-friendly that are not just salads (see list below); however, I decided to just go for a salad anyways and got the ""Super Antioxidant Salad"" with the dressing on the side, which is under the ""Super Food"" page in the menu. It was legit so good. Dressing was on point, almonds, roasted pears, kale, blueberries, etc... so yummy. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed my meal, because chain restaurants don't cater to vegans and special ordering something always turns out way bland. I didn't even have to special order here! I highly recommend this salad for vegans/nonvegans/people who want a salad option.  Here is a copy/paste from PETA's vegan guide of options from Cheesecake Factory. Salads Vegan Cobb Salad Super Antioxidant Salad California Guacamole Salad (Hold the feta cheese, avocado cream drizzle, and try it with any of the vegan dressings listed below instead of the cilantro dressing.)

39,Jeannie T.,"Oakland, CA",90,226,915.0,4.0,2016-02-09,"Came by to eat at the Cheesecake Factory for lunch. I came with a group of 7 people. It wasn't as busy since it was a Monday so we only had to wait a few minutes for them to push some tables together for us. Our server, I believe his name was Theo, was on the younger side so it was easy for our table to joke around with him. We started with the fried calamari, avocado eggrolls, firecracker salmon, and buffalo wings. The fried clamari is always good, especially when they serve them with the tentacles, my favorite part. It had a light batter and was cooked well. The avocado eggrolls are also a must. I prefer the avocado eggrolls from Cheesecake Factory over the ones from CPK. The perfect amount of avocado with bits of sun-dried tomato, red onion, and cilantro, perfectly fried up in a crisp wrapper. It comes with a tamarind cashew dipping sauce. Kinda weird but when paired together, it works. The firecracker salmon was a new appetizer that I'd never tried. It's salmon rolled in spinach and fried in a crisp wrapper. I thought it was pretty good. And the buffalo wings had a nice crunch. It had nice meaty pieces but wasn't overly dry. The crust wasn't too heavy and it was executed well. The crust stayed put with the chicken when you bit into it. Definitely my kind of chicken wing, though I'm more of drumstick person. As far as entrees go, I really should've shared a dish because I was so full just from the appetizers, but I ended up with the Chinese chicken salad and my boyfriend got the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic. The Chinese chicken salad is literally my go to dish whenever I venture out to the Cheesecake Factory. It never disappoints and I love the dressing. It's the perfect a amount of tang with a crunch from the rice noodles, almonds, and crisp wontons.  I also tried the Farfalle that my boyfriend ordered. It's actually really good. It's bow-tie pasta with chicken, mushrooms, tomato, pancetta, peas, and caramelized onions in a roasted garlic-Parmesan cream sauce. The roasted garlic-Parmesan cream sauce was what made the dish perfect. But the cream sauce is a bit on the heavy side, so it's difficult to take in if you've already downed 2 mai tai's like my boyfriend and guy friends were doing. Especially before you've even eaten anything. So we ended up taking that to go.  For dessert, we asked Theo to surprise us because everything looked so good and we couldn't decide on which cheesecake to order. What came out was a s'mores cheesecake and it was the bomb. It was like a heaven on a plate with melted marshmallows, ice cream, and graham crackers. It's so good. You have to try it.  The only small tid bit that I had was that the bread was a bit hard when they brought it out. Almost as if they gave us leftover bread that had been sitting out but was just warmed up to hide the fact that it wasn't fresh. But all of our appetizers made up for it. So it wasn't that big of a deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=80,2.88,2.98,3.208,2.448,2.94

78,Erin K.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",49,289,190.0,4.0,2016-04-02,"*VEGAN* & gluten free review: I referenced PETA's guide before coming so that I would have a good idea of what I could/could not eat. According to the guide, the Cheesecake Factory has a lot of items that are vegan-friendly that are not just salads (see list below); however, I decided to just go for a salad anyways and got the ""Super Antioxidant Salad"" with the dressing on the side, which is under the ""Super Food"" page in the menu. It was legit so good. Dressing was on point, almonds, roasted pears, kale, blueberries, etc... so yummy. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed my meal, because chain restaurants don't cater to vegans and special ordering something always turns out way bland. I didn't even have to special order here! I highly recommend this salad for vegans/nonvegans/people who want a salad option.  Here is a copy/paste from PETA's vegan guide of options from Cheesecake Factory. Salads Vegan Cobb Salad Super Antioxidant Salad California Guacamole Salad (Hold the feta cheese, avocado cream drizzle, and try it with any of the vegan dressings listed below instead of the cilantro dressing.) Kale and Quinoa Salad (Hold the Parmesan cheese.) Falafel Salad (Order it without feta cheese, and with any of the vegan dressings listed below.).) Fresh Vegetable Salad (Hold the white cheddar.) French Country Salad (Hold the goat cheese.) Tossed Green Salad (Hold the croutons.) Endive Salad (Hold the blue cheese.)

The long waits at busy times and big plastic buzzers contribute to that effect. The food is competent, standard anywhere-in-America fare, but very caloric, huge portions, with large doses of butter and sugar to appeal to the mainstream.

I don't think I'll be eating at any Cheesecake Factory due to this experience cause now I assume that's why they keep the lights so low.. also I was just outside the restaurant holding the pager thing waiting and walked in after I got tired of watching the people that were before me, eating their entrees and they said that she just paged me and deleted my name, then basically said I was too far away for it to pick me up. Cool. Then the nasty happened so basically I'm feeling fuck Cheesecake Factory.  Oh yeah I almost forgot there was a waitress who's walked around and bumped into me and moved my chair when she passed by, and I looked over and got no acknowledgement, then when she walked around; she did the same thing to my dad! I don't know if she just didn't like our ""look"" or whatever but what an asshole, she was just mean for no reason, but I'll take her body language's advice into consideration and never come here again.

All my friends got their food but I didn't (ordered parmesan crusted chicken) after they were done eating I still haven't received my food and the server said that they over cooked my chicken and I guess didn't bother making another one,  so after all that I didn't even have dinner. I wasn't offered anything else or a free drink atleast since I barely got a refill. I wasn't looking for a hand out but I bet if I had been a rude customer and cause a scene that wouldn't have been the case. Pretty disappointed.  And I still left a tip.

619,Jeannie T.,"Oakland, United States",90,226,915.0,4.0,2016-09-02,"Came by to eat at the Cheesecake Factory for lunch. I came with a group of 7 people. It wasn't as busy since it was a Monday so we only had to wait a few minutes for them to push some tables together for us. Our server, I believe his name was Theo, was on the younger side so it was easy for our table to joke around with him. We started with the fried calamari, avocado eggrolls, firecracker salmon, and buffalo wings. The fried clamari is always good, especially when they serve them with the tentacles, my favorite part. It had a light batter and was cooked well. The avocado eggrolls are also a must. I prefer the avocado eggrolls from Cheesecake Factory over the ones from CPK. The perfect amount of avocado with bits of sun-dried tomato, red onion, and cilantro, perfectly fried up in a crisp wrapper. It comes with a tamarind cashew dipping sauce. Kinda weird but when paired together, it works. The firecracker salmon was a new appetizer that I'd never tried. It's salmon rolled in spinach and fried in a crisp wrapper. I thought it was pretty good. And the buffalo wings had a nice crunch. It had nice meaty pieces but wasn't overly dry. The crust wasn't too heavy and it was executed well. The crust stayed put with the chicken when you bit into it. Definitely my kind of chicken wing, though I'm more of drumstick person. As far as entrees go, I really should've shared a dish because I was so full just from the appetizers, but I ended up with the Chinese chicken salad and my boyfriend got the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic. The Chinese chicken salad is literally my go to dish whenever I venture out to the Cheesecake Factory. It never disappoints and I love the dressing. It's the perfect a amount of tang with a crunch from the rice noodles, almonds, and crisp wontons.  I also tried the Farfalle that my boyfriend ordered. It's actually really good. It's bow-tie pasta with chicken, mushrooms, tomato, pancetta, peas, and caramelized onions in a roasted garlic-Parmesan cream sauce. The roasted garlic-Parmesan cream sauce was what made the dish perfect. But the cream sauce is a bit on the heavy side, so it's difficult to take in if you've already downed 2 mai tai's like my boyfriend and guy friends were doing. Especially before you've even eaten anything. So we ended up taking that to go.  For dessert, we asked Theo to surprise us because everything looked so good and we couldn't decide on which cheesecake to order. What came out was a s'mores cheesecake and it was the bomb. It was like a heaven on a plate with melted marshmallows, ice cream, and graham crackers. It's so good. You have to try it.  The only small tid bit that I had was that the bread was a bit hard when they brought it out. Almost as if they gave us leftover bread that had been sitting out but was just warmed up to hide the fact that it wasn't fresh. But all of our appetizers made up for it. So it wasn't that big of a deal.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=80,2.96,2.76,2.884,2.16,2.84

I had to insist he take them back to the kitchen.  Everyone else at our table had finished eating by the time the first of my taco's arrived (I had insisted they start).

But, we have always overlooked this as the Chicken Bellagio is so unique and the Artichoke appetizer is back on the menu. The Food overall is so good! The menu so diverse with so many choices!!!!! We were seated, our wait person introduced himself. We ordered the Calamari and Artichoke as appetizers. Both were delicious. No change in plates, from tiny bread plates with butter wrappers. Are we expected to reach over each other to eat or dip into the sauces? We asked (after I returned a dirty knife) politely, this happens, for other plates. We were asked 'what size'? These were delivered by another waitperson filling in for the first one. The other plates weren't removed.

My friend ordered the burger which was chewy and way too salty (this from a girl who salts everything). The fries tasted of old grease/oil. None of us had more than 2.  The Orange chicken was dry and chewy (yes just like the burger) The rice was sticky and crunchy (like plastic).  Unfortunately ,the only thing I wanted was soup, the Clam Chowder didn't sound appealing, they only have one soup a day even in the rainy winter months. I simply opted for Ginger Ale and a wait until we got home.  Sadly, the food was so disappointing, the service took forever, that  we opted to skip desert and get the heck out of this place.

Fortunately we were able to get a table quickly without a reservation, although there were a lot of larger groups waiting for a table. A taste of familiarity occurred when we realized the woman walking us to our table used to work at another restaurant we frequent. Upon this, she had our server 'treat us extra special'.

They've hired new servers that often get the bill wrong; twice recently we were given the wrong bill and charged for other folks' food. Took days to have someone else's bill reversed from my card.   Secondly, a new waiter came lumbering over, sweating and dripping sweat onto the salad plate as he layed the dish onto the table. Same waiter touching food with thumbs. Talk about appetizing!!  Thirdly, service is noticeably slower and appetizers often come out AFTER your dinner.

I have a relatively long list of issues I had while there so I'll just start from the beginning.  Firstly we were seated at a dirty table that took waayyy too long after we were seated to be cleared. Our server Hannah H finally brought us bread and DIRTY plates said she would be back to take our drink orders and then disappeared for a good 20 minutes, long story short she took the dirty plates back and never brought new ones out. We got the mac and cheese balls and a side of asparagus as an appetizer. SIDENOTE the asparagus side was $6.95 for 5 soggy unseasoned cold pieces of asparagus... what. It was an hour and a half after we arrived that we finally got our food. The appetizers (cold) came with the main dishes -- the plates were obviously sitting under a warmer forever before being brought out to us. I ordered a burger with a side salad, and didn't receive the salad until after myself and everyone else in my group was done with our entrees, keep in mind the salad was literally just spring mix drenched in balsamic vinaigrette. Our water cups were only refilled once after being directly asked for a refill. Overall it was just a really lame experience, we were so so neglected which is totally unacceptable. Hopefully this can be taken constructively and changes can be made to ensure better service in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=80,3.64,2.62,2.704,2.408,3.0280000000000005

Finally after 35-40 minutes it came out. After we finished dinner, the waiter brought over plates and announced these are for the cake. My husband had a special cake dropped off before dinner and it was supposed to be a surprise. He ruined the surprise and my husband wasn't very happy. They were specifically given instructions that it was a surprise. Anyways, we paid and left. Fast forward to Sunday, (7/2) ...my son vomited all day and night. I took him to the emergency room and they hooked him up to IV fluids and anti-nausea meds. He had tests done and it came back he has enteritis. The doctor said it's usually caused by food.

I have a relatively long list of issues I had while there so I'll just start from the beginning.  Firstly we were seated at a dirty table that took waayyy too long after we were seated to be cleared. Our server Hannah H finally brought us bread and DIRTY plates said she would be back to take our drink orders and then disappeared for a good 20 minutes, long story short she took the dirty plates back and never brought new ones out. We got the mac and cheese balls and a side of asparagus as an appetizer. SIDENOTE the asparagus side was $6.95 for 5 soggy unseasoned cold pieces of asparagus... what. It was an hour and a half after we arrived that we finally got our food. The appetizers (cold) came with the main dishes -- the plates were obviously sitting under a warmer forever before being brought out to us. I ordered a burger with a side salad, and didn't receive the salad until after myself and everyone else in my group was done with our entrees, keep in mind the salad was literally just spring mix drenched in balsamic vinaigrette. Our water cups were only refilled once after being directly asked for a refill. Overall it was just a really lame experience, we were so so neglected which is totally unacceptable.

To be quite honest I try to not be negative and write bad reviews and I am always the person fighting to give servers larger tips but this may top one of the lesser experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. I came into the restaurant, was seated right away because it was a very slow night (probably for good reason - others know what I did not). My server came over - seemed very nice - I placed my order and then that is where the fun starts. For the next 35 minutes (and I know it was this long because I made a call right after I ordered so I checked what the time was when I made the call) on a slow night, I did not see my server, my food, nada. Glass was empty. I had to get out of my seat to go ask another waitress to see if she could help find my server and my food. She comes back a few minutes later to tell me they burnt it so they are remaking the dish.  My server finally shows up with the food and asked me ""how do those look?"" I responded ""they look fine it's the first I have seen them"". She said she had them remake them because the first order was burnt. By the way they were the Cajun Chicken Littles. I greatly appreciate that they remade my order but I am not sure I need to be grateful that the process took 35 minutes when the restaurant was dead and it was their mistake. No manager ever came over to discuss what happened (the waitress that went to solve the riddle earlier implied one might). No apology for the long wait time was vet made. Still glass is empty. Finally some water arrives. Hallelujah.  I finish my meal and then the bill comes. Not only was there no considerations for the 40 minutes of my life that was wasted but the charge was even more than the menu price. I asked if I could swap mashed potatoes for asparagus. Reply ""Sure no problem"".  The bill had a $4 additional charge which was never mentioned. Moral of this whole story is I have no idea why I didn't ask for a manager. I have no idea why I left even a penny for a tip but left a tip (reduced but nonetheless) and I am writing this to warn everyone that the way this place is being run is absolute dog s*^%.

If I could give their manager and Michelle zero stars I would. We got here at 4:30 pm and we did not get out until 7:15...WHY?? Because apparently they had just changed their menu and ""the kitchen was having a hard time with it"". There were seven of us, and two of us didn't even get our food until everybody else was done eating. One of the late plates came with white rice that was absolutely dry....how you mess up steamed rice is beyond me but whatever. It happened. This wasn't even the worst part. Our server, Michelle, was absolutely flustered. She just could not handle her work and it was showing and we weren't even that needy of a table, but she only refilled our waters twice in the TWO HOURS AND FORTY-FIVE MINUTES we were forced to endure her service.  Anybody would become annoyed by waiting for so long to just receive food and the check. We were pissed especially after a long day in the city. When the checks came, she messed it ALL up. Again, how she did it was beyond me. We had three tags already separated And we had all put our cards down with the correct receipts, but when she came back they were all completely swapped and some of us paid more than we even had to. I understand splitting tags is hard. Ok. But She didn't even apologize for all the inconvenience. She managed to blame the kitchen for late food and get pissed at the fact that we were beyond annoyed with the service. She was rude to us as if we were the inconvenience!!! After speaking to Luis, the manager TWICE he said the best he could do was comp dessert.....of all the things he could of done he thought that was his best option?? Not even a coupon to return not even a free meal that was over 45-minutes late, not even an apology!! This was absurd. Absolute WORST service I have ever experienced here, and let me reiterate that it has never, never, never, been this terrible. It wasn't even busy when we arrived and because of there inability to provide good customer service, we had a great day ruined by a terrible attitude and a manager who can barely manage.

Scott is ALWAYS on top of it with refilling water, which is always a great thing when I'm at a restaurant because I love to drink ice cold water and seem overindulge on it. He's attentive -- greeting us as we sit down, taking our order, bread, a plate of strawberries for our toddler, etc. He jokes -- I asked for no egg in my salad. So, when he's repeating back our order to confirm, Scott jokingly said I asked for extra egg  Our last visit Scott was amazing because we were daringly out to eat as a family with our newborn. He doted on her, telling us about his 2 kids. The baby started to get restless during dinner and he recognized that and helped us get our food boxed up as quickly as possible. We were getting cake to go bc it was our older daughter's birthday and he treated us to a dessert as a congratulations for the baby. Totally unexpected but such a nice gesture. Scott is hands down one of the best servers I've ever had and I really hope he gets recognized for his hard work.  I'll add, close to a couple of years ago I was out to dinner at Cheesecake with an old friend who is known to be high maintenance at restaurants. Scott was our server at the time. I'll never forget this meal because I was actually embarrassed by her behavior toward him. She had special requests with everything she ordered because of whatever diet she was on at the time and its restrictions.

He doted on her, telling us about his 2 kids. The baby started to get restless during dinner and he recognized that and helped us get our food boxed up as quickly as possible. We were getting cake to go bc it was our older daughter's birthday and he treated us to a dessert as a congratulations for the baby. Totally unexpected but such a nice gesture. Scott is hands down one of the best servers I've ever had and I really hope he gets recognized for his hard work.  I'll add, close to a couple of years ago I was out to dinner at Cheesecake with an old friend who is known to be high maintenance at restaurants. Scott was our server at the time. I'll never forget this meal because I was actually embarrassed by her behavior toward him. She had special requests with everything she ordered because of whatever diet she was on at the time and its restrictions. She wasn't considerate or appreciative toward him for his work to make sure her meal was correct. He very much went above and beyond to accommodate her. Long and short of this story, he was smiles and rainbows and didn't miss a beat while dealing with my difficult companion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=20,3.44,2.84,2.712,2.612,3.08

If I could give their manager and Michelle zero stars I would. We got here at 4:30 pm and we did not get out until 7:15...WHY?? Because apparently they had just changed their menu and ""the kitchen was having a hard time with it"". There were seven of us, and two of us didn't even get our food until everybody else was done eating. One of the late plates came with white rice that was absolutely dry....how you mess up steamed rice is beyond me but whatever. It happened. This wasn't even the worst part. Our server, Michelle, was absolutely flustered. She just could not handle her work and it was showing and we weren't even that needy of a table, but she only refilled our waters twice in the TWO HOURS AND FORTY-FIVE MINUTES we were forced to endure her service.  Anybody would become annoyed by waiting for so long to just receive food and the check. We were pissed especially after a long day in the city. When the checks came, she messed it ALL up. Again, how she did it was beyond me. We had three tags already separated And we had all put our cards down with the correct receipts, but when she came back they were all completely swapped and some of us paid more than we even had to. I understand splitting tags is hard. Ok. But She didn't even apologize for all the inconvenience. She managed to blame the kitchen for late food and get pissed at the fact that we were beyond annoyed with the service. She was rude to us as if we were the inconvenience!!! After speaking to Luis, the manager TWICE he said the best he could do was comp dessert.....of all the things he could of done he thought that was his best option?? Not even a coupon to return not even a free meal that was over 45-minutes late, not even an apology!! This was absurd. Absolute WORST service I have ever experienced here, and let me reiterate that it has never, never, never, been this terrible. It wasn't even busy when we arrived and because of there inability to provide good customer service, we had a great day ruined by a terrible attitude and a manager who can barely manage.

We walked in and the atmosphere seemed a bit unorganized and should have known our fate when our greeter escorted us to our table-but there was no table. He had to go get a table and set it up while we stood in the isle.  I ordered a cheesesteak sandwich with Swiss cheese and bell peppers. It came 30 minutes later with no cheese and no bell peppers. Waitress-took it back and it was remade again-wrong.  I received my sandwich 25  minutes later with bread so hard-my steak knife could not cut through it. I sent it back asking for fresh bread and it came back 20 minutes later undercooked without cheese or bell peppers --again! How can a cheesesteak sandwich be so difficult? Manager came over and said sorry-but nothing else. Luis-was less than professional.

To be quite honest I try to not be negative and write bad reviews and I am always the person fighting to give servers larger tips but this may top one of the lesser experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. I came into the restaurant, was seated right away because it was a very slow night (probably for good reason - others know what I did not). My server came over - seemed very nice - I placed my order and then that is where the fun starts. For the next 35 minutes (and I know it was this long because I made a call right after I ordered so I checked what the time was when I made the call) on a slow night, I did not see my server, my food, nada. Glass was empty. I had to get out of my seat to go ask another waitress to see if she could help find my server and my food. She comes back a few minutes later to tell me they burnt it so they are remaking the dish.  My server finally shows up with the food and asked me ""how do those look?"" I responded ""they look fine it's the first I have seen them"". She said she had them remake them because the first order was burnt. By the way they were the Cajun Chicken Littles. I greatly appreciate that they remade my order but I am not sure I need to be grateful that the process took 35 minutes when the restaurant was dead and it was their mistake. No manager ever came over to discuss what happened (the waitress that went to solve the riddle earlier implied one might). No apology for the long wait time was vet made. Still glass is empty. Finally some water arrives. Hallelujah.  I finish my meal and then the bill comes. Not only was there no considerations for the 40 minutes of my life that was wasted but the charge was even more than the menu price. I asked if I could swap mashed potatoes for asparagus. Reply ""Sure no problem"".  The bill had a $4 additional charge which was never mentioned. Moral of this whole story is I have no idea why I didn't ask for a manager. I have no idea why I left even a penny for a tip but left a tip (reduced but nonetheless) and I am writing this to warn everyone that the way this place is being run is absolute dog s*^%.

We had a couple of occasions to be in Corte Madera around lunchtime this fall, and ended up one time at The Factory. Well, of course I always am leery about a place with 3,000+ calorie meal options, but there it was in the middle of the menu book, SALADS! Actual healthy salad options. I went for Chinese chicken salad, the small one please with dressing on the side. It was surprisingly good, with crisp greens and noodles, lean chicken, and herbed just to my liking!

We had a couple of occasions to be in Corte Madera around lunchtime this fall, and ended up one time at The Factory. Well, of course I always am leery about a place with 3,000+ calorie meal options, but there it was in the middle of the menu book, SALADS! Actual healthy salad options. I went for Chinese chicken salad, the small one please with dressing on the side. It was surprisingly good, with crisp greens and noodles, lean chicken, and herbed just to my liking!

My 10 year old chose this place as he loves the food here but it was one disappointment after the other. Our drinks took forever and didn't come out u till our food came, two appetizers that we ordered never made it to the table but were on our receipt of course! My steak was super cold and the food was completely off tonight! We went through three different servers since they had to go on breaks and they had zero communication with each other. No one knew if the bread had eggs, if the pasta had egg or the burger bun! What a let down!
