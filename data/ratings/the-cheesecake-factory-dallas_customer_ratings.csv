Cheesecake Factory is like how H&M is for clothes, get upscale items for a lower price.  It's actually a great concept.  During this visit, i ordered the Chicken Carbonara while the boo got the Cajun Jambalaya pasta.  Of course they never skimp on their portions, so value is always guaranteed.  Each pasta was cooked nice and had plenty of flavor.  We shared the Tiramisu Cheesecake, which was very good.

If you plan on going at prime time... expect a wait... it is a busy and popular restaurant. I've been to the Cheesecake Factory many times and have never had a bad meal.  The menu is extensive to please anyone's taste, the portions are large (so plan on taking some home or sharing) and the food is consistent and visually beautiful to the eye. The fried calamari are the best I have ever eaten! The corn fritters... wonderful! The salads are fantastic and you can even buy the jars of salad dressing if you wish to take some home to make your own salad. Have never been disappointed here.

The menu really indicates that they like Italian food but there are other types of food. I never get salads. Why? I don't care for salads that much unless it's the waldorf salad. You want a salad? go to Soup or Salad. I go to these places to eat what they can create. That's just me. I had the Macaroni Cheese Balls and let me tell that they were worth it. My gosh. My son had their pepperoni pizza and it was just fine. The tea was watered down. I hate that. My wife had the Romano crusted chicken that came with what looked like plain spaghetti in an oragne sauce, not amazing but ok. I had the 4 cheese penne pasta with chicken. It was good and the sauce resembled a vodka sauce and it was  great. For dessert we shared the pineapple upside down cheese cake which was of course delish.

The first spin dip that arrived tasted crabby....ew. We sent it back and the replacement was just really bitter...no seasoning...bland...it just sat on the table. The chips were better than the dip. The eggrolls were tasty as was the salad....the tamale cakes were mushier than usual.  CF really needs to pair down their menu...it's just too many selections to be good at all of them.

67,Mike S.,"Dallas, TX",0,1,,1.0,2013-06-06,"Went to the local Cheesecake Factory for a date night with my wife. It started off normally enough. Excessive waits between server visits and long spells with empty glasses, but i've become used to this level of service from the CF. What really ruined the evening is when my wife's omelet arrived. She cut into it, worked towards her first bite and then pulled a clump of hair the size of a grape from the omelet. It was all she could do not to puke right then and there. Unfortunately, the (suddenly) attentive servers wisked the dish away before i could take a proper image, immediately destroying any proof. The manager (at least i think he was. he never identified himself) came up and appologized profusely (which i appreciated!) and asked my wife if she wanted anything while she waited for another omelet. She asked for a side salad.  At this point, i've put my food aside, because i'm not gonna eat while my wife waits. 15 minutes later the salad finally comes back. 20 minutes beyond that, the replacement omelet finally arrives. (My food is beyond luke-warm at this point. Ended up boxing it all up to take home and reheat) It was hair free this time. But then, they charged us for the side salad while she waited and for the omelet. I'm not saying we deserve free food, but c'mon. If i had been quicker on the photo-taking, this would have had an entirely different outcome.  I don't expect anything to come of this, but i felt it was my responsibility to alert other patrons (since apparently hairnets aren't a responsibility of CF). If you're looking to blow $50-$60 on a nice place, go somewhere else. You're wasting your money and time at this CF location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=240,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.8840000000000003,3.2000000000000006

262,Kevin G.,"Dallas, TX",94,112,16.0,1.0,2013-06-14,"We hadn't been to the Cheesecake Factory in years, but tonight we needed a place that had dessert and was open late. My wife and I took my Mom to dinner, and after we dropped her at home, we both realized we wanted something sweet. The only problem was that it was 10pm, so a lot of places would be closed or closing. Someone mentioned Cheesecake Factory, the Maps app on my phone said they were open until after midnight, so off we went. No wait on arrival, which was good. Asked for a table, no problem. Found the desserts on page 467 of the menu, good to go. So far, the only issue is they don't have pie. No pie? The waiter shows up, gets a drink order, starts going through specials, and my wife says, ""I think we're just having dessert."" He wanders off to get the drinks. Behind me, I hear an angry female voice whisper, ""They're just having dessert?"" This made me feel uncomfortable, since I don't like strangers angry at me, but out of the corner of my eye, I noticed she was carrying a tray with two whole pieces of bread, so she was probably just overworked. I hope she found a more worthy table to receive her bread. We ordered ""just dessert"" (our just desserts?) Next, our drinks arrived. Out of the corner of my other eye, I noticed something on the end of the table. Our check. Drinks, check, food.  Has the serving order changed? I ordered alcohol, and I'm not a small person, and many people can tell I'm Irish - wouldn't you leave that tab open? It's interesting how a piece of paper in a plastic sheath can ruin an otherwise fine piece of chocolate cake. ""Fine"" as in tasty, large and slightly over-priced. So, I see no need to go back. If you get he bum's rush out of a place for just ordering dessert when the name of the place contains ""cheesecake"", I don't need to visit any longer. Ironically, it took forever for the waiter to notice my credit card so we could pay and make room for real customers. If you want to be known for desserts, perhaps you should warn staff that some customers will come in to order it. The last time I received a check before my order was in a New York diner after midnight. We got my food, the check and then my wife's food. So, that was slightly better than tonight.

The horseradish sauce was flavorless. The cheese was not melted. The total sandwich was nothing short of horrible. They need to remove this item from the menu or learn how to make it correctly. I also did not like the fact that I was upsold to the largest size beer without my knowledge. Usually, the customer is asked what size he/she wants.  What I liked: the wife's Chicken Bellagio was delicious--the chicken was moist and tender, really good flavor. The accompanying pasta with pesto was a bit oily but overall it was a good dish. As usual, the portion is enormous.  The winner of the meal was the cheesecake; we got a plain piece and it was so good that we could have made a meal of that alone.

You will be pickled by the time you leave due to the sheer amount of sodium found in their food thanks to people testing them to provide consumers a better picture of what they are eating. Again, I have no problem at all with eating unhealthy foods, but don't bill some things as healthy when they have more carbs, grams of fat, and calories than the worst burger combo you can think of at a fast food chain.

Our food arrived which was delicious, as always.  The food is overpriced for what it is.  We can eat at much higher quality restaurants with a nicer atmosphere for the same price, but we wouldn't dare take grandma or the nephew to those places.  Entrees are $14-$20 on average.   We notice our nephew holding his shirt over his nose.  We give him a dirty look and he tells us that grandma farted.  My husband can't take it anymore.  He starts dying laughing.  He orders a shot to get through remainder of the meal.  I'm speechless at this point and attempting to keep a straight face.   When you go to Cheesecake Factory, of course, you have to order Cheesecake.  That's another 10 minutes before we can escape.  Grandma orders coffee afterwards, another 10-15 minutes.  The night is dragging on.  I escape to the restroom to get a break from dinner at the zoo.  The floors are waxed with a substance that must be meant for slip n' slides.  I keep my balance and manage not to fall.  In the restroom someone else is very loudly passing gas and it's not grandma.  At least this person went to the restroom to do it.  Back to the table I go.   After another 15 minutes or so we are finally ready to leave.  Our nephew discovers the slip n' slide floors and runs to slide yelling 'woo hoo'.  We drop the nephew and grandma off.  We survived the night.  The staff at Cheesecake Factory act professional and treat you like royalty even when you bring problematic people.  I feel sorry for them, but I am thankful that we can count on them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=240,3.52,3.34,3.34,3.216,3.4120000000000004

If you missed it mark it down on your calendar next year July 30th. Cheesecake factory has the largest variety and best tasting cheesecake hands down. Their name says it all, it's consistently good and they never run out. You would think they would run low on some varieties especially near closing time, but they don't.   I enjoyed my cheesecake as always only wished I could have made it earlier for dinner.  If you haven't tried the Red Velvet you should it's awesome but if you need a Chocolate fix I recommend Chris's Outrageous Cheesecake, its brownies, and German chocolate all rolled into one delicious mouthful.

Now one of the party members has a child that does not like to be touched so we had to be specific. No more than 90 seconds I come back and they said oh you are back. I gave the table to someone who was wearing the same shirt as you. How stupid is that. Then the manager doesn't even offer anything in return until I had said you mistakenly gave away my table and and try to sit me at a 5 person table. That is horrible. Keep in mind this dinner was for a big dinner meeting with clients and being squished together wasn't going to work. I got upset and said this is insane that is all you can do.

My only complaint is the wait here- you really need to go during a weird time to get a seat immediately.

Five minutes later a gentleman with a loud voice came over and announced over the din that he would be taking over as our waiter. He seemed very capable and adept at handling large parties. A couple of the orders got mixed up and had to be sent back for a re-do but overall the experience was good. I ordered the lunch portion of the chicken carbonera. It was plentiful but I expected the sauce to be a little richer and creamier and not so watery.

They need to improve lunch that's why I'm giving 4 stars. I did apologize to our waiter and told him I was going to order something else. He was really gracious about it. I ate the Chicken Madeira which I love it's so good. My fiancé enjoyed his turkey burger he did mention he could of done without the drowning of the onions and mushrooms I thought it tasted good with the combination.  We also enjoy the bread and butter.

66,Alicia F.,"Dallas, TX",0,1,,1.0,2015-07-23,"Well I have to say I'm fairly disappointed in not only the cooks this evening, but the manager tonight as well at the Dallas NW highway location. Dinner with my family; husband and kiddos meals are fine. I ordered the Steak Diane medium rare. It came out medium well to well done. Our server Amy quickly sent it back and gave me an estimated time of 8 minutes.  About 6 minutes later I got a dish that was RARE. It was seared for probably less than 60 seconds on each side. ONE small medallion was edible.  I gave up. Amy checked on me while she was balancing a tray of what looked like a dozen pink lemonades, however by that time I was pretty much done. My family was finished and I told Amy I'd just eat some of the mashed potatoes. She was more than happy to offer me something else but I just wasn't in the mood to wait any longer.  I did request to have the meal removed from our bill, which is fair at this point.  Well the manager (who I won't name publicly) decided I needed to be charged for a side of mashed potatoes (which I only ate about half of) Incredibly tacky!  I would suggest in the future that if someone isn't able to eat the meal they ordered to NOT charge them a side order.  Bad move management, especially since you didn't even give me the courtesy to show back up at the table and ask me about the second time my meal was prepared incorrectly!

35,Lisa T.,"Chicago, IL",243,173,699.0,2.0,2015-08-01,"Food (3/5) In celebration of National Cheesecake Day, boy and I came in to pay our respects. We had the complimentary bread (shoutout to the phenomenal brown wheat bread!!), entrees, and a slice of strawberry cheesecake. My entree order was the Shrimp Bistro Pasta. Tossed in a lemon cream sauce, the spaghettini also contained battered shrimp, tomato, arugula, and mushroom (though I asked for the mushrooms to be removed). The pasta tasted great for only two bites because it was so stinkin' RICH. The cream felt extremely heavy and ultimately made me feel sluggish and gross for consuming so much. Now, also consider that the portions at Cheesecake Factory are HUGE, thereby making the whole eating process completely uncomfortable. For future visits, I'll probably ask the waiter to box up half my order ahead of time, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel like I was going to have a heart attack afterward.  And we hadn't even had the cheesecake yet!! Granted, the cheesecake was a good level of fluffy, so it may not be to people's liking if they prefer the ""harder"" cheesecakes. Crust was delicious but I could probably do without the excessive amounts of whipped cream. I could see it being too overwhelmingly sweet for some palates as well.  Service (0/5) One question can summarize our service experience that entire night: where is our waiter??? We were there for about 1.5-2 hours from initial seating to final payment of the bill. I understand it can get busy, but I would have appreciated a slightly quicker pace and/or more transparency in his slowdowns. Atmosphere (3.5/5) Decor in Cheesecake Factory is the same as all others nationwide. Plenty of booth or table seating in hues of brown and beige. I would have given a 4 for atmosphere but it felt way too crowded and the tables were packed next to each other.  Bottom Line Food is good up to a point but it's extremely heavy and rich so I'd probably try to better portion control next time. Had very bad luck with service so hopefully it's better next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=60,3.6,3.46,3.46,2.6000000000000005,3.5160000000000005

My date and I were quickly seated and the server took our drink and app order in a timely manner. The app (spinach and cheese dip) was great, better to eat with the bread. However, after delivering our drinks and apps the server was rather busy with other tables and it took a while for her to get back to us.  The restaurant allows you to order some entrees in lunch portion sizes before 5pm and we almost missed ordering before 5pm because it took a while for the server to come back. It also took a while for us to get bread too although I'm not sure if you are supposed to ask for it or if it is supposed to come no matter what so that may be my fault.  Another server delivered our entrees which were huge even for a lunch sized portion. We both got pasta and I wasn't particularly impressed with my pasta. I ordered the garlic noodles with chicken. The garlic sauce was rather bland. My date got the cheese noodles and it too was alright.  The highlight of the meal was of course the cheesecake.

277,Johnathan D.,"Dallas, TX",4,7,,3.0,2015-10-08,"I took my wife to this location for our 3rdyear anniversary. I called several hours in advance to book a table for two. I specifically asked for a table no where near a bathroom, the kitchen or where there would be foot traffic (like waiters next to a kios). They were very nice over the phone and said no problem we'll take care of it. We arrived at 5:30 and I had forgotten at how refreshing it was in The Cheesecake Factory. It had been probably 10 years since I had been there last. We were seated in the far back next to a giant wall with a great view of the restaurant. I felt really good about the table until only a minute after we sat down we heard pans being dropped on the floor, plates clinking together and orders being yelled loudly. We had been seated only feet away from the kitchen. There were no doors between where people sit and where the kitchen is. The only thing between us was a wall but on both ends of the wall there was a huge area where waiters were walking back n forth and our table was right next to it. I tried to ignore it but after trying to have a conversation with my wife more pans were being dropped in the kitchen and it was so loud I couldn't even carry on a conversation without thinking (what is going on back there?) and my wife agreed. I asked my waiter Michael if we could sit somewhere else. He completely agreed with me that it was so loud and he gave me the option of where I would like to sit. I chose a booth far away from the kitchen and it ended up being a perfect spot. We ordered mixed drinks, some kind of marinated steak (My wife chose it so I forget the name) and their popular fresh strawberry cheesecake which was excellent. I ordered the pineapple Moscow Mule which was an interesting twist on the original Moscow Mule and my wife ordered a drink (forget what it was) but it had rum in it and it was absolutely awful, at least for me. It was pure alcohol with a splash of food coloring (from the taste of it) or something. It had no taste to it except the alcohol. I am not one to complain about an extra shot or two from the bar tender but at $10 a glass and it being a fruit drink it should have a nice flavor to it instead of every time you drink its like taking a straight shot of rum. My wife did order a second one but she agreed with me it was too strong to be a mix drink. We ended up having a great time at the end. The initial bump with giving us a table right next to the kitchen even when I specifically asked not to be took 2 stars away. It is just unacceptable. In fact, they really need to put doors there instead of leaving these giant gaps open. Those kitchens can get so loud I don't see how anyone can enjoy a conversation over a meal sitting at those tables only feet away from the kitchen. Michael was a great waiter. It wasn't his fault we were seated there. What was even more odd was that the restaurant was probably 80% empty because we got there early before the dinner rush and we were still seated at probably the worst table in the entire restaurant.

I ordered a Steak Diane, and requested bread and water to snack on while we waited.

51,Connor C.,"Colleyville, TX",0,101,1.0,3.0,2016-01-05,"I've eaten at numerous Cheesecake locations and used to visit the Northpark location fairly regularly.  First, I have to say the food at Cheesecake is honestly really good quality compared to other chains. I have heard they make everything from scratch on-site (with the exception of their bread and cheesecakes, ironically). You can taste that it seems better quality than a lot of other restaurants. My favorites there are the spicy cashew chicken, chicken tenders, pizza, Caesar salad (romaine always tastes fresh and plate is cold), southern chicken sliders, and the fried cheese. Really haven't had many issues with the food.  My main issue with this location is service. Often, if I'm heading in for lunch, I will go sit at the bar. For the past year or more, the bartender that always seems to be there waiting on me is just not friendly. I understand not everyone has an overly friendly demeanor, but he just doesn't smile, doesn't seem attentive, like he could care less whether you're there. I tried to ignore it, but it does make you not want to eat there when the bartender serving you isn't at least pleasant like they appreciate your business.  I compare this to the bartenders at another chain - Houston's - and the difference is night and day. The folks at Houston's aren't necessarily overly friendly, but they are always courteous and provide really attentive service, which is all I'm asking for.  I always feel I ask for the bare minimum and always try to tip 20-25%, but doesn't seem to help.  I hope the manager at this location will see this and have a talk with the staff in the bar area about how they are treating the customers. Until then, I will probably go to the Allen location.

If Tolstoy were in charge of making a menu, I would expect it to be slightly shorter than this. Somehow with boundless options, the macaroni and cheese burger seemed the way to go. I expected a cheesy mac to sub for cheese (like the queso in a queso burger I recently had elsewhere). Instead, it was a relatively flavorless ball of fried rigatoni with only a hint of cheese. What it lacked in flavor, the macaroni ball added in sheer height to the burger, making a detachable jaw a near necessity when attempting a bite. Choosing a cheesecake, the very namesake of the entire restaurant, was another dilemma. Should I go simple? Fruity? Chocolatey? I couldn't refuse the  mango key lime. Apparently I also can't assume fruit based cheesecake is even remotely naturally flavored. I think the syrup from canned peaches are more natural than the orange goop on top. The lime flavor was weak too.

251,Mystery L.,"Dallas, TX",0,7,,1.0,2016-08-04,"Let me preface by saying me and my family have been meeting at the Cheesecake Factory for over 15 years. We live in the Dallas Texas area and frequent three of the locations Frisco, Arlington, and Rt 12 / Northwest Highway in Dallas, depending if  we are coming from work, or depending Where We Are while traveling around the city. Northwest Highway Cheesecake Factory over the past seven years has consistently going downhill in the consistency and quality of food. 4:30 today my daughter and I went in to get one of our favorite dishes which is the chicken Madeira. Aside from odd attitude that was on the rude side with the waitress when we asked her for extra butter because three paths are just not enough... gave a dirty look and rolled her eyes. When we received our food the chicken was over done quite rubbery. The potatoes where as if they had been sitting since lunchtime and also tasted like the dairy that was used in it was sour/went bad.. The Madeira gravy was extra peppery. At no time did our waitress come over to ask us how our meal was. Aside from the bad food we had to combat against a plethora of fruit flies that were trying to attack our food  one of which got into my daughter's gravy boat. My daughter got up & spoke to the general manager named Pat or Patrick who she explained all the issues at no time did he show empathy or apologized. He only offered to get us new mashed potatoes and gravy. When he came over to the table we showed him the fruit flies. Still no empathy, no let me remake your food because the whole dish was a disaster. He just completely disregarded  the horrific  quality of service and food  we received as if it was acceptable . OK in the meanwhile I called up the corporate number, took a picture of our receipt, the varioud flies we caught and s picture of the underside of the   show all the food and filth / crime that was stuck  underneath the table. While on the phone leaving a voicemail with corporate since they close at 4 p.m. suffice as to say... if you want a good experience with Cheesecake Factory the Frisco location by far is more consistent, they're serving portions are generally decent and the quality and professionalism is important to the staff.  As one more side note we were at the same location last week and had the same meal. They ran out of mashed potatoes and this time they were soupy and gave us barely half cup portion of potatoes and served it to us knowing full well they ran out of mashed potatoes.

A situation demonstrated by other reviewers. This time it was lousy service. The hostess seated us right next to two large noisy parties, one a birthday party. We requested to move 3 booths down and the hostess caught an attitude and flat out refused to allow us to move, claiming no other area was available even though this was a late Sunday night with a sparse crowd. Then we waited. And waited. Aaaand waited. For several minutes we waited for a server that would never appear. I would have tracked down a manager to fix all this but my headache from the noisy people led us to get the hell out of there. Which we did.  This isn't Black Eye Pea prices...it's Cheesecake Factory prices.

199,Mike T.,"Addison, TX",0,29,,2.0,2016-09-08,"Cheesecake Factory used to be our family favorite place.  But the quality of food and service has gone down.  This is my experience eating here on 9/8/2016. The food:  3 of us ordered 3 entrees (fried catfish, factory meatloaf, factory burger), 1 appetizer (calamari), 1 drink (passion fruit magarita), 2 cheesecakes (red velvet, s'mores). Total cost $95 before tip.  Sort of expensive for the quality of food. The food: The drink was pathetic.  A lukewarm magarita that tastes like cough syrup and costs $11.25. The bread (pumpernickel and sourdough) was nice.  But the slices were all unevenly cut. The calamari was greasy, The presentation was poor with a wilted piece of parsley thrown on top of a tub of marinara sauce. The entrees were all right. Nothing special but the portions were large.  Enough leftover for a second meal.   The cheesecakes were good.  Presentation was poor.  One piece of cheesecake fell on its side when it was brought to the table. The service: The waitress was unfriendly.  Sloppy to say the least.  Threw stuff on the table.  Refilled water only once.  Put drinks on table without coasters or napkins.  Overall, the experience of eating there was very uncomfortable. The food and experience is not worth the cost.   I would come back if they cut the price in half. ### in response to the comment from business manager of cheesecake factory ### Hmmm.  I think many people are like me when having a bad experience with a restaurant... just end it and move on.

My husband has a cheese allergy, but enjoys their flat bread crust. I would think that since the pizza salad lunch is so expensive, why are the pizzas basically already pre-made? We frequent the Arlington location near the Parks mall and they have never had an issue making his pizza.

I came here Monday for lunch with the bf to celebrate a BIG promotion for work. We got the fire cracker salmon, Jambalaya pasta and Chicken Bellagio.  When we were done eating the pasta, we waited for 15 mins for her to get back to our table and all she said was ""I'll come back for some to go box"" since we have some left over pasta. She didn't even bother to ask if we need or want something else. Mind you, she passed our table a few times ignoring us for the whole entire time. Well she actually filled our water glass one time and we had to ask her for that. The other server who passed our table was too nice and asked if we need anything else... I asked if I can speak to a manager instead.  We wanted to get 2 cheesecakes and coffeee as well. We came here to spend money and celebrate but she is really not worth my time and my extra tip.

165,Robbie D.,"Oak Lawn, Dallas, TX",724,69,280.0,3.0,2017-02-13,"Coming to Cheesecake Factory has always been a treat, especially after the movies or shopping at North park.  I always enjoy coming here as the the atmosphere is always inviting and of-course  fantastic cheesecake that they come to know for.  My experience on Friday evening is mixture of good and bad. I rarely ever post anything negative but rather, constructive so here it goes... As we entered the restaurant and upon visiting the host desk to add our name to the wait list, we were quoted 10 minutes. During our short wait, I casually browsed the robust cheesecake selection and made mental notes of what I'd like to order for my dessert. Our host/Hostess called our name and then sat us. As we were guided to our table, I already made assumptions on the fate of our evening which would likely be excellent based on previous visits at other notable locations . I've been to Cheesecake Factory in Oahu Hawaii, Beverly Hills California, Miami Florida and of course Texas.  As we were seated, our server arrived and greeted us. He asked to take our drink order and and checked to see if we'd like to start our evening with any appetizers. The evening were off to a good start ! After a bit of a wait, he arrived with our drinks and took our dinner order. As we relaxed and chatted, I noticed, where's our bread? and where is the coffee to my cream? All of which I asked for earlier when we first arrived and that was 15-20 minutes ago. Thankfully, the cream and the bread finally arrived but now the sweetener is missing so my coffee is now cold and flat. Unsure at this point to ask for anything else as there always seems to be a seven to ten minute delay. As I attempted to partake on the bread and butter, I encountered another issue, which was our cutlery. My knife by appearance looked unwashed and in my opinion unsanitary to placed at any table let alone an established restaurant of this caliber. I took a knife at the unseated table next to us hoping it's cleaned and polished to no avail, so the fork was the next best thing. Again, at this point not confident any requests would be well executed. Our dishes arrived, I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp  and it was just as magnificent as I recalled at other locations. The sauce was light but was big in flavor. I particularly enjoyed the subtle hints of peanuts, curry and oriental spices which accented the chicken and the shrimp nicely. Our guests receive their entrees as well and we were a happy table. From this point on it was smooth sailing. Our entrees were delicious and our drinks were kept full for the duration which is a nice reprieve from the first half of our visit.  For dessert, we indulged on the Tiramisu cheesecake which was light by cheesecake standard but big on tiramisu flavor. There were noticeable hints of cocoa, mascarpone cheese and cinnamon. I could of had two although one was perfect for sharing!  Overall assessment: clean your forks and knifes, it doesn't set a good precedent for your guests when they are about to spend 25-30$ on dinner and have dirty cutlery.  If someone ask for coffee and it's accompaniment, everything should be delivered as such and in unison. That said, the beautiful decor, consistency in the food quality and of course the cheesecake selections are all great attributes!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=20,3.28,3.13,3.292,2.316,3.19

226,Bill M.,"Dallas, TX",0,3,,1.0,2017-03-07,"Today is 3/7/17.  Notice the date of my dinner, 1/27/17.  This has been my worst experience with restaurant management ever.  I am normally not a complainer, but this experience should be heard by upper management and dealt with. I normally love the Cheesecake Factory and have taken my family there many times.  This time I ordered curbside take out for my family of five.  I got there and let them know I was ready to pick up my order.  The server said we will be out shortly with your order.  I sat there and watched two other cars who came in after me get there orders.  I sat there approximately 15 mins.  I called back inside to check on my order, and they said it was coming out.  The server was very nice and gave me the order and took my Gift Certificate that I received as a Christmas Gift inside to complete the transaction.  I looked thru the order and noticed we were missing an item.  I told the server when he came back with my receipt that there was an item missing and we went over the order.  He said, he was sorry but they only had down 1 instead of 2 of the appetizers I ordered.  I was on speaker phone with my wife when we ordered and they repeated it back to us when ordering it.  So he says that he will have to charge me for the item since it wasn't on the order.  I have been waiting for 20 mins now and my food is getting cold.  I was not happy about him charging me for their error, but I said go ahead because we needed the item.  After charging me $11.85 for the item, I waited another 10 -15 mins for it to come out.  Now the whole order, which was $70 plus dollars is cold and I have to drive another 15 minutes home.  After I got home and had a limp dinner, I decided that I would call the manager about the experience.  Gretchen, said she was sorry and asked what she could do to make it right.  I told her that I would like a refund for the $11.85 because I shouldn't have been charged for that mistake and that she could give me some kind of gift card for my bad experience.  She offered a $25 gift card that would come in the mail and she would refund my $11.85 on my credit card.  Weeks go by and I received nothing.  I call Gretchen back and she tells me that it has to go thru corporate in California and it takes about 2 weeks to process. A month goes by and I call Gretchen again and tell her I have not received either a refund or a gift card.  She says I can come to the restaurant and she can give me a $25 gift card because it is taking so long.  Now I have to go out of my way, go to the restaurant and get the gift card.  She says that the refund and original gift card are still going to come in the mail.  Now it has been 6 weeks.  I still have no gift card, and no refund.  I speak with Patrick, the General Manager, and he gives me the same story about it has to go thru corporate and he can't do anything about it.  He is not accommodating at all.  I am very frustrated and I ask him, ""if someone has a bad meal in your restaurant, or has a complaint about service, don't you as the GM have the authority to comp their meal an make it right on the spot?"" His response is, ""what do you want me to do to make it right?"" He plainly isn't going to offer anything, just put the ball back in my court. Really?!?  I told him I wanted a $50 gift certificate because I have spent 6 weeks and many phone calls and gotten 0 satisfaction for being a good customer.  He says he will mail me one or I can come to the restaurant and get it.  Again, asking me to go out of my way in order to just be reimbursed for my bad experience.  I ask him to mail it to me and he says he will that day.  Today is 1 week to the day since I talked with Patrick.  I HAVE RECEIVED NOTHING FROM CHEESECAKE FACTORY!!!!  I call and ask for Patrick and get the 3rd manager I have spoken with now, Reggie, and he says Patrick is not there and he will follow up with him on it tomorrow.  He said he texted Patrick and he got a response of ""already sent it. "" Now I know I have just been lied to by management.  I doesn't take 6 weeks to get either a refund on my credit card, which could have been done on the phone with my information and a credit card machine, or to get a gift certificate mailed to me, even from California! I AM STILL WAITING....... Gretchen could have solved the issue when I called her the first time.  She should have just said, I am sorry for this mistake.  You can have the same order on the house next time you come, or I will personally send you a $75 gift certificate to cover the meal.  That's it!  Problem solved!  DON""T SAY, ""IT HAS TO GO THRU CORPORATE AND WILL TAKE 2 WEEKS!!!!!! NOBODY WANTS THAT AS A RESPONSE!!!!!!!  And then not to follow thru with it?!? Just outright lie about it. Most of the complaints I have read online have to do with poor management.  Maybe the District, Regional, or Head of Customer Relations should take a hard look at this locations' management skills and how customers are treated.

The food is delicious. However, certain dishes could be be better and the menu is so loaded it can be overwhelming. A few years ago for example I ordered some kind of shrimp dish and the shrimp they use is very fishy. I'm a huge shrimp fan, but couldn't handle it, so I simply never ordered it again.

As most visitors would say, the portions are large, even for a lunch menu. I would say the servings are in line with the price points. My lunch menu cobb salad was enough for two meals. In my opinion, after years of trying some of this and some of that in the menu, the salads are the most consistent menu items. But let's be honest, the place is known for cheesecake, and lots of it.

174,Ashley M.,"Dallas, TX",179,120,44.0,1.0,2017-04-14,"I was here a few days ago for happy hour.  At first things were going well.  I sat down at a table by the bar. The place was fairly empty. There was a lot of wait staff just kind of hanging around conversating.      I ordered a cosmo and the Fried Chicken sliders. I was brought out the hamburger sliders. Smh. I was really irritated by this being that I literally hadn't eaten all day. I was not happy with having to wait on them to remake a dish that was put in the system incorrectly.     The waiter argued me down saying that I did not specify which sliders I wanted. But I definitely said fried chicken sliders and I pointed to it on the menu as well. But let's say, his version of the story was correct. If I did not specify which sliders I wanted, why didn't you just ask me which ones I wanted, instead of playing the guessing game?     I called a manager over and the nonchalant look on his face let me know that he didn't think a waiter arguing with me was a big deal.

162,Ray F.,"Dallas, TX",80,414,160.0,4.0,2017-04-15,"A Friday night with a group of 7 at 7 PM at a place most of us had never been.   Me and my date got there 45 minutes early to get on the list and had a drink at the bar.  Kind of surprised for the cost, but the atmosphere was nice. As the rest showed up early, our pager went off and they had a circular booth for us which was way too small.  So back on the list we went and tried to hide in the bar to get out of everyone's way.  About 10 minutes later, we had a table. The menu and all of the additional inserts requires more than a few minutes to a new patron to read. I can only imagine how complicated the kitchen must be. The wait staff was great and got most of everything right. She brought bread and butter which with 7 hungry people, did not last long.  I ordered the mini crab cakes and a small garden salad to start.  Both were right temperature and tasty.  Timing was good.   My main course was the Americana Burger.  It was juicy, flavorful and huge!  The fries were hot and tasty.  My only complaint was the tiny container of ketchup. Seriously, I spent over $80 on a meal for 2 and they skimp on ketchup?  The wait staff brought more when I asked. The only problems from the rest of our group was a mix up on a salad being ordered and a steak not as ordered. All enjoyed their meal and experience.

108,Max D.,"Dallas, TX",459,98,1203.0,1.0,2017-05-13,"One of the worst dining experiences i have ever had. First off i just want to say i was always a fan of cheesecake factory, large menu with good food and delicious cheesecake. I also rarely give one stars for most of my reviews but this was truly a one star experience.  Me and my gf stopped by after shopping at northpark mall nearby. The wait was about 30 mins or so even though we were past lunch hour stopping by around 2:30. We figured as much since its mother's day tomorrow. When we were seated the waiter was super short with us and obviously was in a rush since when we asked to order our food after giving our drinks order he said only drinks right now since he needs to get drink orders to his other tables first. Ok thats understandable.  I should have known things would go downhill when i received my drink order of a Belvedere on the rocks with a lime. The waiter got it wrong and it came back completely full and totally watered down not what i was expecting when i just wanted a shot on the rocks pretty much. I didnt complain since they were busy and didnt want to wait for another drink. Then the food eventually came and my gf got a sante fe salad and i got a four cheese pasta with chicken. Everything was great until i went for a bite of my pasta when i noticed a hair in it. That pretty much completely ruined my appetite right there.  We notified the waiter who brought the manager over who was truly sorry and offered to remake it which we said okay to. He also offered a complimentary salad or soup which we rejected. I had a couple bites of the remade pasta but just lost my appetite at that point. They eventually comped the pasta portion of the meal after my gf asked about it. They probably should have comped the whole meal. The waiter wasn't apologetic at all. The manager was and did say they are supposed to wear hairnets in the kitchen and he was truly sorry.  Unfortunately i still need to rate this 1 star. Long wait for a disappointing drink they messed up, hair in my pasta and very unfriendly service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas,2.52,2.95,3.228,2.5000000000000004,2.7780000000000005
183,Mary A.,"Grand Prairie, TX",0,14,5.0,1.0,2017-05-15,"Chaos, terrible service, mediocre food. We went yesterday for Mother's Day. It was absolute chaos upon reaching their doors! I was appalled by how many people were just crammed together as soon as you opened the doors! I had anticipated a crowd and had called before asking if I could make a reservation, I was told reservations were only accepted for parties of 7 or greater. We arrived a little before 5pm. It was my husband, me, and our 2 daughters. We managed to squeeze our way towards their host station. There were several girls there huddled and frazzled. I approached them, NONE of them bothered to acknowledge me nor even make eye contact with me. I tried calling out to them above the chatter of the crowd, mind you I am standing directly in front of them. Finally one notices me, takes our name and hands us our buzzer, with a 45 minute wait.  At 6 pm our buzzer finally goes off. We squeeze through the crowd again up to the hostess. We show her our buzzer, she takes it and tells us to wait on the side...we stood there maybe another 20 minutes until finally our waiter shows us to our table. This was my first time at The Cheesecake Factory. The menu had a plethora of meals to choose from so it took me a few minutes to decide. I ordered the Chicken Bellagio, my husband ordered the Jambalaya, my daughters both had the kids' chicken strip meals, and we ordered the Avocado toast as an appetizer. I am so upset about my experience there that I have taken this time to explicitly describe our visit. Now, to me, this may not be a classy establishment, BUT going out to eat at any restaurant not considered a fast food joint, should take great stride and pride in presentation, preparation, and quality of their meals and service. In the food industry, especially, pleasing your customers is how your business grows and exists in the first place. I digress...so our Avocado toast arrived. For presentation, I would give it a big, fat, thumbs down. Now, we were starving, and after such a horrid wait, we were hesitant to delay eating any longer, so my husband and I both had a piece of the toast. The taste was awful. We ordered the Avocado toast, what we got was guacamole, slathered sloppily on toast. Had it been good guacamole, our hunger would have allowed us to look past that, unfortunately, it was brown and tasted awful. I eat avocados every day, so I know old avocado when I see/taste one. As hungry as I was, I refused to keep eating it. We let our waiter know and he said he would see what could be done since half the toast had been eaten! A manager came by and was hesitant to help. He offered to make us another one, a fresh one, we were still paying for it afterall. A new toast did arrive, no brown, still guacamole. We said nothing. My husband's jambalaya was okay, definitely not an authentic jambalaya but not terrible. My chicken Bellagio was mediocre. It was two halves of chicken breast with some sort of panko crust on it. The pasta underneath is was a tad bland but not awful. Now my daughters' chicken strips were BAD. I can't believe whoever cooked them even passed them along to be served. They were overcooked to say the least. The batter was burnt and had a burnt, salty taste.  We ordered a slice of cheesecake, it was good, turned out it was on the house when we got our bill. After this epic fail, I will never return to this establishment. I don't care if they'll use the holiday as an excuse. It is poor management and poor organization and service of their employees. The place was chaos! Couldn't even distinguish the line for their bakery and the line waiting to be seated, let alone those entering and leaving the restaurant.  They need a more efficient method for seating their customers and definitely an update and revision to their food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=40,2.4,2.92,3.216,2.5960000000000005,2.712

Years ago I used to come here for lunch or a slice of cheese cake but I think that my taste buds have evolved and now the food taste less that mediocre and for the price I know a thousand places that I would rather give my money. So I see now they have small plates. I ordered the toquitos and this bacon grilled cheese. The toquitos amounted to 2 tasteless deep fried rolls of flour tortillas laying in a puddle of salsa.

Instead of emptying some out on the table, the man decided to use his dirty finger to mash some down into the shaker. However when that didn't work he blew the excess on to the floor. Other people have to use that shaker that you just blew all over!!! That's not Cheesecake's fault!

105,Kevin S.,"Dallas, TX",27,179,39.0,3.0,2017-11-02,"This is the cheesecake factory and if you've been there before, you know that everything here is usually pretty darn good, on the food and dessert menu. Everything has been consistent year after year that I've gone. I actually prefer going to the one up in Allen at Watters Creek. This location gets busy. I went on a weeknight at about 630 and trying to find a place to park was ridiculous. The wait inside was about 30 minutes, well that's what they told us, it ended up being about 45 minutes.  I don't know if they take reservations, but I honestly would not go to this place on a Friday, Saturday evening and probably would try to stay away from it Saturday and Sunday during brunch and lunch hours. Not because of the food or anything, just because of the parking and the wait situation. I've never had an issue with service at this location.  But, like I said, the food is always good here, it's consistent and I know I need to try more things other than the meatloaf dinner, shepherds pie and the big burrito!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas,3.2,2.91,3.208,,3.0260000000000007

In a months time and had horrible service from the elderly gentleman  in the bar area, today we waited 25 min to get water, I went and spoke with the host stand to see if he could get some help and they did nothing. 10 minutes later we decided to leave and I went back to the host stand and explained that we were leaving and then they decided to try and do something about it.  Oct. 19. I went for my bday and, again had the same server. He was rude. Couldn't get our order straight and gave us attitude when we tried to explain our order. He should not have the bar area to himself, he cannot handle the fast pace of the bar area alone.  I enjoy this place very much and go at least 3-4 time a month or more but  two times is unacceptable unfortunately I will not be returning.

However, I realize that's not really their fault, they're just very popular. Anyway, I must brag about the wait staff. Lauren H. was absolutely fantastic. We came with a party of 12, celebrating my daughter's birthday. Of those 12, 9 were teenage girls. Can you imagine serving 9 teenage girls? And of course they all ordered this, that and the other special requests, ate three bites, and then needed take-home bags. There was absolutely nothing Lauren could have done better. Attentive, expedient, knew the menu inside and out, and all with a smile.

186,Misha H.,"St. Augustine, FL",0,3,,1.0,2017-11-23,"I had THE worst experience here. I love Cheesecake Factory but this one was a huge disappointment. I ordered curbside to go it took forever then when I got my meal they completely left the shrimp off both dishes. Cajun Jumbalaya Pasta and the SHRIMP and sausage pasta. Like really??? No shrimp on the shrimp and sausage pasta? So while I went inside to let them know, the waitress bought our second bag of food to the car. My mom realized the fries for my daughter weren't in the bag and the waitress all but accused my mom of hiding the fries to get more. She ""knew"" they were in the bag because she put hem there. Meanwhile when she came in as I was talking to the manager to get my food fixed she says oh I also left their fries out completely my fault i didn't put them in the bag. But you literally just told my mom you did. Finally got my food, three measly pieces of shrimp on each plate that are now pretty much a separate dish bc they don't have any of the dish's flavors, then the fries and then had to wait for the bread we had requested.They offered nothing for the trouble hell not even a glass of water just had me wait the 30 extra minutes and sent me on my way. If you want great service DO NOT go here. They are a terrible establishment!!! Find another one!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=40,3.08,2.93,3.196,,2.99

The food was pretty good I recommend trying the chickpea and goat cheese salad it's really good! My friend did not like the beef stew and they brought her something else so fast, took the beef stew off the tab, the manager came to apologize and ask what she didn't like so they could make changes and gave us a free slice of cheesecake for the inconvenience.

109,Kimberly S.,"Plano, TX",0,14,4.0,2.0,2017-12-07,"Lately the food has been a disappointment.   The chicken in my chipotle chicken pasta was rubbery and barely warm.   It's like the entire plate of items were cooked at different temperatures. Though the service was good, I just think there are better places to eat with comparable prices.  I typically have no issues but my last few visits are either hit or miss (no middle ground) and  after today I'm afraid I'm not ready return here anytime soon. I normally come here for the chicken dishes and pastas.  The last few entrees were off in seasoning.  The dishes are not hot, as if it sat for a while before they delivered it.  The service is acceptable given how busy they can become, but a poor quality meal is unacceptable. Perhaps, stricter management in the kitchen. I also sent this complaint to the restaurant directly and I got a return call from Mike...I'm not confident that any changes will be implemented and quite leery about going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas,3.08,2.95,3.188,,3.0020000000000007

The bananas in my cheese cake were soggy and brown making the crust and the bottom of my cheesecake wet.

102,Randall R.,"Sachse, TX",216,257,62.0,4.0,2017-12-09,"I never have complaints here.  They have a multitude of well prepared standards.  TCF is generally not thought as a super-healthy alternative, and that's a shame, because one really knocks my socks off - the vegan cobb.  That name is a bit of an oxymoron, because it is not a cobb salad - no egg, no bacon, no blue cheese, no chicken, but it;s the best vegan salad in Dallas.  Loads of healthy grains, nuts, seeds and fresh vegetables - they really do it up right. Food: 4 stars Cost is a  bit of an issue on some items.  While that vegan cobb is a steal at $12.50, this is not where I would come for a $28.50 ribeye, a $20.50 steak diane, or a $6.95 side of asparagus, but that's always an issue with menus this large.  It's tough to be all things to all people. Price: 3 stars The setting is fine, maybe a notch below the aforementioned upscale price point.  Atmosphere: 3 stars The waitstaff is as professional as you would expect.  They know the menu and they know how to treat customers - very professional Service: 4 stars I'll average up, because the restroom was very clean, and will return for that awesome vegan cobb.

Now usually they bring bread out to us or at least that's what we thought. We asked the woman who brought us our food if they usually bring the bread out and she said ""KINDA"" I asked, what do you mean by that? She stated it's only given upon request.

Saturday night was the first time I visited this oh-so-famous restaurant chain and we were greeted by 50 odd people waiting their turn (at 9 pm on a Saturday) The wait was 1.5 hour and we decided to sit at the bar instead. After a 30 minute (excruciating) wait we finally found some seating at the bar and impatiently ordered some water and bread. By this time we were starving and decided to order our appetizer and entree together Appetizer- Fresh Basil, tomato and cheese flatbread  Entree- Louisiana chicken pasta, no chicken and substituted mushroom with sundried tomato (Dietary restriction- Vegetarian husband) As the first statement of the review says, the flatbread was to die for! The best one we ever tried! The pasta was delicious, specially when we added with thesundried tomato! There are few things we did want to try,  - Long Island iced tea- which my husband said was epic! - Cheesecake!- which I had no room for at the end of my meal Nevertheless, I have previous tried the Godiva and red velvet cheesecake takeouts and they are delicious! Goes without saying the food is brilliant, but I did take one star off for the long wait and for the restaurant not accepting prior reservations (previously tried on multiple occasions)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas,3.12,2.92,3.184,,3.0000000000000004

The only negative here was that the floors are slippery everywhere, as are the menus, leaving you feeling like there's a thin film on both. The table seemed to have the same residue.
