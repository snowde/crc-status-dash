130,Lauren B.,"Bedford Hills, NY",26,40,,4.0,2012-01-06,"Delicious food and drinks, but the wait is 100% unreal, and the battle to get a bar table would make even a trained UFC fighter flinch. I've seen waits of 2-3 hours at this place. I hope the new addition of Brio right next to it might draw some people away from Cheesecake factory, but probably not. If you want it to be empty you have to go for lunch, or at a really bizarre time. I went to eat there once at 3:30 in the afternoon and it was close to empty. However for dinner...I've never actually waited on the insanely long list to get a real table, I always sit at one of the bar tables that you have to fight over like king of the hill.

No consistency like the one at white plains. The noodles were overcooked. The bacon was burned not crisped. No garlic flavor like it normally comes. The sauce was even watered down. Looked like soup.

110,Pam L.,"Norwalk, CT",1,5,,2.0,2012-08-05,"We went mid afternoon on Friday, having read the Yelp reviews mentioning long waits. Got seated within five minutes. Waited another fifteen minutes before our server came to tell us they were temporarily out of bread. Not a problem, we wanted only dessert. He took our order for one tea, one coffee, and two pieces of cheesecake. Five minutes later cups for the beverages arrived - one came with a dirty cream ring stuck half way up the interior of the cup. Getting a clean cup only took eight minutes. He had also forgotten the cream and sugar. After our desserts were served, he never checked back to see if we needed anything further. We had to wave at him, down the aisle to get our check well after we were done. When the table of four next to ours emptied, two young bus boys eventually removed the dishes, then used a damp cloth to smear several spots of left behind hamburger grease into a streaky, greasy residue all over the table surface; they set the table and left. The next set of diners located the greasy smears as they leaned on the table with their bare arms. They then had to wait to catch someone's eye to get the table properly cleaned. Two main points will summarize our experience:  1) This is by far the smallest CF of the six I have visited, perhaps, accounting for the reported very long waits. Other locations are multiple times bigger. 2) Cleanliness is of NO concern here. Dirty dishes, dirty tables, ketchup smeared on the menu, even most of the servers' white attire were desperately in need of washing.  Perhaps, this location can coast by on the goodwill built up by their other locations or on the strength of the company provided cheesecakes. But as a stand alone restaurant, the extreme lack of cleanliness and very slow, incompetent service would normally be a death knell. I would rather they improve, if only up to merely mediocre.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-danbury-2?start=100,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.728000000000001

I ordered the Ahi Tuna and the Chicken Di Pana. My wife had the Carlton salad. The tuna was good and came out very quickly. I wish there had been more tuna though. I felt like it was mostly avacado. My chicken was lightly breaded over a light cream sauce. My sides were broccoli and mashed potatoes. The broccoli was cooked perfectly, a little al dente. My potatoes were a large portion but were luke warm. Overall, the entre had good portions and was tastey. My wife's salad had chicken in it and was a large salad. She also said that it was tastey. We had a slice of red velvet cheesecake for dessert and it was very good. One slice was good enough for two after dinner. The service was good, just when you were wondering where dinner was, it was served. The cost of the meal was about $55 with tip and no drinks. Luke warm potatoes and the 30 minute wait are what's preventing me from giving it 4 stars. In the future it will be hard for me to justify waiting 30+ minutes to eat at a chain restaurant when you can get an awesome meal at a locally owned one.

This is my fourth or fifth visit to assorted Factories Cheesecake, and I think I can remove the mask - it's an overpriced, slightly-more-upscale TGI Fridays with impeccable, military-level service. To those who don't eat out much, it's probably palatial. Pretty much everything is overpriced for what it is, but this is justified (depending on your attitude) by the portions being overwhelmingly big - even the salads are enough for three or four people, without exaggeration. The cheesecake wedges you get are gigantic, weighing a good pound per slice. This will please some, I suppose. I'd rather pay less to get a smaller quantity of better product, but I guess I'm insane. I had (half of) a Cuban sandwich, which was decent but not terribly meaty. Fries were somehow simultaneously very salty and slightly tasteless, though they were nice and crisp. My 'dessert' was a $6.50 glass of Sam Adams. I probably should've gotten cheesecake after all, and eaten a tablespoon of it per day for six months. They do have an obnoxiously-named (""Skinnylicious"") diet menu, which is fairly extensive, but if you're on ANY kind of diet, it's probably best to just not eat here.

It gets 5 stars for being in a class by itself.  It is not your typical chain like TGI Friday's or Outback, but it is also not a NYC steakhouse.  The prices are higher than a Ruby Tuesdays or TGI Fridays and honestly, you can't compare the food.  The sauces and dishes at the Cheesecake Factory are very good and do not have that 'packaged' flavor that  is sometimes found in chain restaurants.  It feels fancy yet offers a casual atmosphere.  You can eat at a table, in a booth, outside or at the bar.  All the workers are friendly. There is usually current music playing in the background. The lighting is on the darker side unless you eat outside during the day.  The decor is trendy and unique. I've been there in jeans and have also seen many casual dressers dining after a day at the mall.  I've also seen other folks dressed very fancy.  Anything goes - as long as its presentable.  The menu has a huge offering. . .  Everything from salads, pastas and steaks to lettuce wraps and numerous offerings from their 'skinnylicious' menu. They have two pages of cheesecake offerings.   My absolute favorite meal is:  deep fried macaroni & cheese balls for an appetizer, Hibachi Steak and the strawberry shortcake.  I also like the plain cheesecake. The deep fried mac & cheese balls come four (4) to an order and is served on a red-sauce.  It is outstanding.  The hibachi steak is a marinated strip steak served with onions, mushrooms and bean sprouts in the sauce alongside smashed red potatoes and breaded asparagus.  The sauce is very flavorful. The strawberry shortcake is so big is is ridiculous.  It is a large scoop of vanilla ice-cream in-between a buttermilk biscuit that is surrounded by fresh strawberries and topped with whipped cream.   Too much food for one person.

I'm not really an impatient person, but a two hour wait time is a little extreme. I recently had the opportunity to go out to eat with my mother, and we decided on the Cheesecake Factory. This was a weekday around 3:00 in the afternoon. The positive: The staff: they were extremely helpful. The portions were rather large. The negative: It took a long time to get our food brought out to us, and when it finally was brought to us, it had a hair in it! I called my waitress over, and let her know, she removed it immediately. The manager came over, and addressed the situation immediately. But then it was another half hour to get my replacement meal.

I arrived ahead of time and asked the hostess if she had recently sat my friends since I thought they arrived already. She would not let me out my name on the list again insisting that I probably was on the list. It turns out we weren't so that caused us to wait even longer since more people had been added to the waiting list. Over 40 minutes later we finally get seated and our server was Damien D. He was friendly at the beginning then became very snooty soon after his friend was seated next to us in an adjoining booth. The food was not bad. I had the garlic noodles while my friends had chicken piccata and bang bang chicken and shrimp. We knew we definitely wanted dessert so we asked the he wrap our leftovers. Ordering dessert we knew that we also would like that to be placed in a to go container knowing we could not finish it. My friend also ordered a take out order for her husband. He said it wasn't a problem and went on to get our order. Good thing I checked my bag since he gave me the wrong dessert. Upon requesting the correct order he snatched the wrong one in a huff as if having to actually do work pained him. Then in a snooty tone saying my correct order of strawberry shortcake was being prepared. To pay the bill we did ask he break it down with three cards.  He said it was no problem but proceeded with an attitude. Once I received my so-called strawberry shortcake it was in a large container which looked like a scone and three what looked like soup containers. I asked Damien what he gave me and with a bigger attitude proceeded to say it's my strawberry shortcake order to go as if I'm some kind of idiot. Last I checked he should be catering to the customers who in turn pays his salary. His attitude was a complete turn off and would NOT recommend this Cheesecake Factory.

And, honestly, I can think of few things that compare to the Godiva Chocolate cheesecake. No joke. In fact, every time I've had cheesecake there (no matter the flavor), it's enough to make me dizzy. My kids shared the chocolate layer cake (the one with chocolate chips on the outside) and it was equally as good. My 5 year-old proclaimed it the best thing he's ever had in his life. :) And he's a pretty picky eater.  Had the herb crusted salmon salad for my dinner and wife had the Americana. Both excellent dishes. Oh, and the sweet potato fries are done perfectly here as well. Staff is very friendly. But, they need to hire MORE. We were there on a Sunday evening. The place was slammed.

48,Alfred F.,"Hartford, CT",123,193,197.0,3.0,2014-09-08,"Came to Danbury to meet my daughter halfway, from NYC. My wife and I decided to have dinner at the Cheesecake Factory at the Danbury Fair Mall. Having eaten at the one in West Hartford a number of times, we were gearing up for a one-hour wait. Even though they were in full dinner mode, imagine our surprise when we were sat within 10 minutes! Our waitress, Caitlyn, greeted us as she ran by with a stack of plates for another table, but returned immediately to take our drink order. The menu at CFactory can be overwhelming. It's more of a composition book then a menu, with page after page of drinks, appetizers, chicken, salads, sandwiches, and several pages of ""specialties."" One of the rules of thumb regarding the size of a menu is, the larger the selection, the less likely they can do it all good. I will say that, in our trips to CFactory, the offerings have met our expectations. The food has always been fresh, and they put a heavy emphasis on appearance, making sure every plate is a picture. My lovely wife had Chicken Marsala, and I had Spicy Chicken with roasted cashews over Brown rice. Both dishes were decent, attractively presented, and very large. If I could find anything to improve, it would be the amount of sauce on my chicken, and its consistency...a little too goopy and a little too much. Otherwise, it was tasty. The highlight of course is dessert, where you have the menu returned, and there you are looking over two pages of cheesecake varieties, and even 2 or 3 non-cheesecake sweets! we each had our favorites - Carrot Cate Cheesecake, and Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake. Hard to think there was still room in our bellies, but the plates went back to the kitchen empty! This is the kind of place where you can make a date with your friends or family to meet for drinks at their upscale bar, or sit and be professionally served.

I ordered a beer and was asked for my ID which was fine, the manager then came back 2 minutes and asked me for my ID AGAIN because she forgotten birth month which by the im 30.

I am a former restaurant manager of a top rated restaurant.  I write that because I know what to say when ordering so that there is no doubt in everyone's expectation of the customer experience.  Unfortunately, the two times that I have ordered take-out from this location, they missed the mark both times.  If they hit their mark, this would be a 3 star review on the food alone.  The service drops it to a 1 star because that is what I will remember from this experience and NEVER again get takeout from this place.  Both times I called in and ordered for a pickup time that was not in the middle of the evening rush and I ordered with an hour notice from my anticipated pickup time.  Both times I arrived 5 minutes early and paid in advance and tipped.  Both times I waited and waited and waited and waited and waited and waited and was promised it would be just 2 more minutes, and waited and waited and waited and asked for a manager and waited and waited and then a smiling  manager showed up reminiscent of a Saturday Night Live skit.

Plans changed quickly when we saw the happy hour menu and immediately started salivating. The restaurant offers a wide range of apps from dips to wontons and full on burgers for just $5.50. We decided on the factory nachos, roadside sliders, and fried mac n cheese balls. Of these 3 dishes, we've only tried the fried mac n cheese balls before, which have been AMAZING amaze balls in the past. Tonight, however, was a different story. The balls came out hot and steamy (yes please) with marinara sauce and cheese as garnishes. First bite was crispy and awesome, but then we started noticing a slight plasticky taste. We ate them anyway because, food. We then moved onto the nachos. The chips were stale and the cheese tasted more like cheez whiz. We gave it a good try, but couldn't stomach more than 3 chips each. I know ""unprocessed"" is not the first thing that comes to mind when nachos are on the brain, but these were just disappointing. The sliders, thankfully, were very tasty. The presentation was lacking, as they looked more like McDonald's cheeseburgers, but for the happy hour price we were satisfied. The hostess was very friendly and the bartender was sociable and attentive. She kept the drinks coming, which were also on happy hour special (whoop!).

I don't mind waiting to get in, that's part of the deal and usually a sign of a great spot. Waiting for food forever on the other hand bothers me.  The food is just ok, it's as good as square one down the street which is barely better than diner food.  All said and done, I spoke with the manager, got a $50 credit towards my meal for the obnoxious time we spent waiting. That's great and all, but even if my meal was half the price I still wouldn't go back there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-danbury-2,3.16,3.11,3.11,2.7600000000000007,3.13
41,Michael S.,"Wappingers Falls, NY",0,8,,4.0,2016-12-04,First of all there is nearly always a wait for this place. Just about every time I've been here there was a wait a least 15 minuets. So this is not a quick sit down and eat restaurant.     Now I'm not taking anything away from the wait staff at all. The staff is always friendly and welcoming. Anything you ask for they willingly help please you.  On the down side the food does take quite a while sometimes. When I went the stove and other electronics had some type of malfunction and took more time than usual.  Once the food comes it is mostly worth the wait. I ordered a Mac and cheese burger and it never ceases to disappoint. It's never over cooked.  The price on the food is a little pric but not any more than you would spend anywhere else.   The cheesecake is describable in one word incredible!  I would give it 3 and a half stars because 5 stars is in my opinion for only the top of the line.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-danbury-2?start=40,3.16,3.1,3.1,2.9920000000000004,3.1240000000000006

(Considering the only other time I had seen the inside of one before was on The big band theory lol). If i had to describe how it looked it kind of reminds me of an amped up version of a California Pizza Kitchen. The food was pretty good, we both ordered off their skinny menu which is a great option considering some of their meals can add up to almost 2000 calories in one meal!

I had the skinnylicous beef medallions, medium rare with asparagus and mashed potato, and as always, it was delicious. I also love that it's only 380 calories and that Cheesecake displays the calorie amounts in their menus so I can stay lean! I've had this dish several times before and only one time was it a bit over cooked, but this time it was perfect as the other 90% of the time. Usually a restaurant is not this consistent but I think Cheesecake Factory has a system in place that really provides consistency. As for my service, it was truly perfect. Leah was friendly, had great timing, and it was just a great dining experience all around, including the attentiveness and friendliness of the host. Normally, I leave a 15-20% gratuity, but I left her a $30 tip on a $27 bill because it's so rare to find such polite, friendly people in the service industry.  I so appreciate this kind of effort and gladly will show my appreciation for it.

But since seeing that this specific Cheesecake Factory didn't pass their health inspection very well, I'm a bit thrown off by that. It is a corporate restaurant - you think their standards would be higher than private family owned kitchens. The servers are rude - Sam did not offer us specials or tell us about the new dessert that came out (which is why we came there in the first place) but since our neighbors were offered the new dessert by another waiter, and we weren't, shows how some waiters and waitresses work with pride VS.

19,Katie O.,"Mahopac, NY",94,51,30.0,1.0,2017-07-10,"I counted seven separate problems with our meal yesterday. We arrived for dinner around 6pm and had a 20 minute wait, which we were relieved as we know Cheesecake Factory is usually at least a 45 minute wait. We were able to be seated outside and it was a perfect night to dine outside, so we were pleased with this as well. Our waitress, although friendly, was a total disaster. All went downhill after being seated. We weren't approached for a good 15 minutes after sitting down, so by the time the waitress arrived to take our drink orders we were already ready for our full order. I asked for a sprite and another 15 minutes later she came back with a water (not a sprite), and informed me they were out of spinach dip and threw the menus on our table again. Not a problem, but she then walked away and didn't come back for another 20 minutes to see if we wanted to order a different appetizer and about 35 minutes had now gone by before I could even tell her she got my drink wrong. In those same 35 minutes, we were never brought any bread for the table, despite her saying she'd bring it right out. Once she finally did bring the bread, she never brought any small plates so we ate our bread on our napkins.  Our main course finally arrived a solid hour after being seated (mind you all we ordered for our main course was a salad and a Small Plate??) and my boyfriends steak in his antioxidant salad was dry and cold. (My stuffed mushrooms were very good though). I'll chalk most of this up to it being a busy night, but cheesecake factory is expected to be able to handle a high volume of business with the amount of seating they have. Not impressed even slightly. We arrived for dinner at 6 and left at 8 due to the most miserable dining service we've ever received.
