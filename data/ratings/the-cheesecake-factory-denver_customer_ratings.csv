This is what we order usually at ANY restaurant).  Now, granted the place was busy, but I have been to other cheesecake factories where they were just as busy if not busier and our food still came out in a decent amount of time.  Also, the food here just tasted, well, bland.  Not the taste I had expected at other Cheesecake Factories.   I was looking forward to cheesecake when I first arrived but decided against it because of the amount of time it took for us to receive our food and the entree'st just disappointed us.

Then, our poor server got 6-7 tables at the same time and he was definitely rushed and feeling overwhelmed.  We had to wait quite a while to get our food and when it did arrive, the order was incorrect, so it had to be sent back, which increased our wait time (and we were starving!). The food was average that night, and the portions at Cheescake are huge, so that always means two meals for the price of one!  Our server, however, was very attentive, all things considered and he was very apologetic and quick to make things right for us.   The cheesecake itself here is always a great choice, so you can never go wrong with any of their selections.  My personal favorite: Banana Cream Cheesecake.  It's really light and fluffy and not overly sweet.  Oh!  and they do brunch on Sundays.  The waffles are very very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver?start=200,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.0840000000000005,3.1200000000000006

Cheesecake was good, but again - was it $7.50 good?  I just can't say it was.  For my dime, I would have taken a smaller portion at a slightly lower price.

213,Becca R.,"Denver, CO",66,332,107.0,5.0,2013-01-21,"I went with a party of 2 for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. If you've ever been to cheesecake factory, or if you've read the Yelp reviews, you know about the portion sizes. This is a double portion, so make sure to split your entree in half and box it before you blow your pants out.  The service was literally some of the best I have had in Denver. Trudy, our waitress, kept our drinks completely refilled and even brought us strawberries with our cheesecake because that is one of her favorite additions. The food is delicious and comes out piping hot.  The only negatives I would have is: -It is always packed. -The seating is very cramped. They tried to stick us in a tiny table elbow lengths away from another couple and we just requested a different table, which they took care of right away. -This place is loud. I think it's probably due to all of the marble used throughout the decor, but expect to have to raise your voice. -Parking. Though this isn't a problem for me, as I walk, anyone that drives into downtown is going to have to street park or find a garage and pay while you eat.  -It's so pricey. You're looking at $50 for 2 entrees and 2 cheesecakes. And, while I really wanted a drink I just can't do it at $10 a pop. But, if you do what we did and eat lunch and then take home half of everything for dinner, it's not horrible.

The menu is extensive and I already have issues deciding what to eat when it's limited! The issue with such a diverse menu is that it tells me the restaurant doesn't specialize in anything. It just makes large amounts of food. Quantity doesn't always equal quality. However, the one thing this place does specialize in is their cheesecake and it doesn't disappoint! The pasta meal I ordered left something to be desired and had the typical olive garden, this sauce is too heavy for this meal type feel. The avocado egg rolls where a new venture for me and I liked them more for their novelty than for their greasy taste. They do offer over 50 options for cheesecake (decisions, decisions). I went with the white chocolate macademia nut (the waitress suggested it), and while it was yummy, it was also super rich. The tuxedo mousse cheesecake my friend had looked divine. The prices are what you'd expect for one of these trendy chains but at of all the chain restaurants we visited in Denver, this was my favorite. The only thing I'd like to add is that this place was dim. Infact, I think this was the darkest restaurant I've ever eaten in.

I chose to go with the Fried Macaroni and Cheese Burger with a side of fries. I read the description and never looked at anything else. I was not disappointed. they always have the tastiest french fries, cut to perfection and crispy all around. This burger was so flavorful. I like a well done burger, and this was cooked as ordered but still juicy. The fried macaroni was so tasty, and I was worried it would be too battered, but just the opposite. The macaroni was creamy and complimented the burger perfectly. To add another dash of sin to the dish, they give an additional splash of a cheese sauce over the fried macaroni.

Either I need to enter into a food eating competition ASAP, or The Cheesecake Factory is stingy when it comes to serving up HEALTHY GRUB! I ordered the Tuna Tataki Salad (seared tuna with leafy greens and a sliced tomato) along with a side of grilled asparagus and a side of olive oil dressed green beans. The dish was delicious but, it definitely felt like an appetizer portion.  My dining companion ordered the Shrimp Scampi and the Steak Diane. She was served a MASSIVE dish that was mostly filled with EVIL MASHED POTATOES (a low-carbers nightmare, not that she is a low carb eater or anything)... And a sprig of basil. She was HOPING there would be far more greens on her plate, but nope, the soupy potatoes were the vegetable of choice. She proceeded to not finish the potatoes and instead ordered a side salad.  As for me, I wolfed down my tuna in literally a minute and proceeded to complain that I was still HUNGRY. I have a wolf in my stomach eating the food I ingest... I swear. So I discussed with the waitress how I might be able to get some salmon with more green beans. She was nice and tried to figure out the most cost effective way for me to fill my trap and it worked! I got the grilled salmon and green beans, just the way I wanted.  Of course... I was STILL hungry, but I am just a freak so I decided to slap my baby wolf and asked for the check when I was done eating.  I always remember the Cheesecake Factory being absolutely delicious. It was good but it wasn't ""run around pants-less through the restaurant screaming how much I love the place"" good. I don't think I will be going back.

I was there on Sunday evening, it wasn't too busy because it was about 10, The two of us, showed up and requested the patio, there was wait which was totally cool, the hostess was super friendly and we headed to the bar to grab a drink while we waited. The bartender was on it. Very nice and made us feel comfortable. Then we were called to our table within 5 min of getting a drink. We went to the table it took about 5 min for the server Neil to come over, he didn't introduce himself, if appeared annoyed that we already had drinks, He said "" are you going to eat? what do you want?"" We didn't even have a chance to look over the menu. So we asked him to give us some time and then the service just got worse from there, I saw the other waiter go to his tables way more than I even saw our waiter, After about 15/20 min wait, we ordered our food, then didn't see the waiter again until we were about 1/2 way thru our meal. I ran out of wine and wanted another glass, I had to as the other waiter to find our waiter so I could order another glass, then he seemed to be annoyed, then when he came back out to the patio, he didn't even bring the glass of wine, then about 10 min later I got my glass of wine. My friend had finished his food and I needed a box so I asked to have him box up my leftovers. The night was ending, he didn't even ask if we wanted dessert. I wanted cheesecake to take home, so since he wasn't going to ask - I asked for a slice of cake and the check. I don't know what his issue was but he was extremely unprofessional, his appearance was not up to par (his pants were halfway down his butt), and he just didn't seem to want to be there.

It was my first choice for my annual birthday dinner along with The Old Spaghetti Factory. That one has went quickly downhill over the years, but not Cheesecake Factory. It serves high quality everything. I have been all over the menu. I have yet to find something I don't like. As a child. I would always get the Four Cheese Pasta. Penne Pasta, Mozzarella, Ricotta, Romano and Parmesan Cheeses, Marinara Sauce and Fresh Basil. Also served with Chicken. This is one of the reasons I weighed over 300 lbs. Around 15 years old I realized what carbohydrates are and stopped eating it til I lost some weight.  Anyway, this is a decadent and rich plate of unhealthiness. With 30 grams of saturated fat, 1900 milligrams of sodium and 134 grams of carbs, this is one of the worst things you can put in your body. I don't care. It's delicious.  I recently went with my girlfriend. She ordered the teriyaki chicken. I rolled my eyes. ""Really... Teriyaki chicken. We have all these great pastas, steaks and seafood, and you choose teriyaki chicken."" I said. I'm not a huge fan of any teriyaki. I thought it would be a waste of a trip to order an out of place item like that. Boy was I wrong! This was the most amazing piece of chicken I have ever had. From the grilled pineapple to the perfect char on the chicken to the tender and moist inside of the meat. It was a masterpiece served with steamed rice. I ordered the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic. Bow-Tie Pasta, Chicken, Mushrooms, Tomato, Pancetta, Peas and Caramelized Onions in a Roasted Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce. It was fantastic. Creamy and savory. A dish with perfect harmony. I was surprised by the cheese sticks. Obviously made in-house. Not your typical cheese sticks. Very good. I've been there many times and had many dishes. I wont describe all of them . Just know, they are all good. Of course I have to mention the cheesecakes. As Eugene Struthers would say.

The server brought a large circle of bread with sesame seeds on top, which left my mouth a fan of their bread and pastries. The menu has a large variety of items to choose from, that I'm not sure it's possible to try everything on the menu! I eventually ordered a Blue Cheese B.I.T. Burger topped with their crispy bacon, lettuce, tomato, onion rings and lots of blue cheese! The burger was so fancy, that the top bun was not even placed on top of the burger. The Blue Cheese burger was also a tall burger with lots of onion rings stacked on top the delicious beef patty. I was very much in love when I tried my first bite and enjoyed the beauty of the art that this burger very much provided for me.  I recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking to have an amazing time with a date, friends or with family.

The white chili was okay, but when there is twice the amount of rice than chili, it looks like they're going cheap, while still charging $$.  The spicy chicken sandwich was tasty, but again thrown on the plate, with most of the chicken, smothered in sauce, missing the bun. The most disappointing was the chicken and biscuits. The chicken was black on the bottom (not burnt but black from a not clean grill,) then covered in a bland, lumpy sauce with soggy vegetables. The biscuits were overcooked and dry. We had this boxed up for our dog.  We thought we'd have dessert, but decided against it given our experience.

We decided to go to The Cheesecake Factory for dinner one night, and we certainly wished we had chosen elsewhere. We waited about an hour for a table, but there was nowhere for us to wait comfortably. We hung out up against a wall, but continuously had to move out of the way because the staff needed to get through with dirty dishes. Once we were sat, our waiter (Russ) came right over to greet us, so it seemed to get better from then on. Wrong. It took over 15 minutes for our glasses of wine to come to the table after we ordered them. Then, once our food finally came out, two of my friends orders came out wrong. One of my friends asked for a side Caesar salad with her burger. Her burger came out burnt and with a small salad of mixed greens and no dressing. It took about 20 minutes for us to get out waiter's attention just to bring her some ketchup so she could attempt to eat her burger. My other friend ordered the steak dinner, which is kind of hard to mess up. She is allergic to wheat, and her dinner came out as steak tips cooked with noodles (which it does not say in the menu)? Again, it took 20 minutes just to get out waiter's attention in order to explain that she could not eat the meal if the noodles were cooked with the steak, in order for him to take it back to the kitchen. He said a new one would be right out. About a half an hour later, when the rest of us were done eating, her replacement meal came out, where we had to ask for it to be boxed because we did not want to stay there anymore. A manager never came over to the table, and they didn't even take my friend's meal off of the bill or offer her anything else. I've worked in the restaurant business, and I typically give the wait staff the benefit of the doubt, but our waiter never apologized for the mix-up and took forever just to bring us our bill.

I responded yes because that's that only way I ever eat them. He said ""great, I'll get the order's put in.  Well you can probably guess all I got was a sticky cheese quesadilla. I showed him they error and he says, Oh, you DID want chicken in that??  Yeah, I'm pretty sure I was speaking English when I said that and you confirmed what I said.

You'll find better food, atmosphere and pricing elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver?start=100,3.0,3.21,3.232,2.408,3.126

I've been coming to Cheesecake Factory for literally decades, and always met my expectations (decent meal, nice atmosphere, fair prices for the portions). Tonight however, I ordered the herb salmon and received a blackened, totally burned fish that was inedible. I apologetically sent it back, and 20 minutes later the manager personally served me completely raw fish. Of course the manager came back, said he was so embarrassed, and we walked away with a free piece of cheesecake and paid a $70 bill even though one person in our party didn't even eat dinner. Manager looked at the floor when he walked by our table while we finished our wine.. total slap in the face.

120,TJ A.,"Denver, CO",109,70,6.0,3.0,2016-10-02,"I really like the Cheesecake Factory. I've frequented locations in several different states.  Last night,  my husband and I came to this location for the first time.  We expected a wait but we also requested first available open seating on the patio.  When we were starting to be escorted to a seat inside,  my husband asked what happened with the patio seating. She looked flustered but she apologized and looked for available seating.  When she said we would need to wait my husband told her waiting was out of the question so please go ahead and just seat us.  She responded.. ""well I don't want to seat you if you are angry"". We didn't know how to process that so we took a seat and tried to deal with it.  It went downhill from there. We were sitting next to an obnoxious group of ladies and their waiter leaned over our table to take a picture of them without any heads up.  He didn't even ask us if it would be OK.  It totally interrupted our conversation and quite frankly it was pretty rude. We had to sit there and back up so that he could take pictures of them.  I hate when people lean over me and I really hate it when they do it at a restaurant. My husband spoke with Connor who is one of the managers and he was very professional and courteous.  We decided to stay and eat... until my husband realized that his steak wasn't cooked. He has to have his steak well done.  This steak was red on the inside.  Completely unacceptable! On a positive note,  once we voiced our concerns with Connor, he immediately apologized and made it right. He is really an asset to that establishment and because of his actions we will definitely try this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver?start=120,2.88,3.15,3.212,2.7960000000000003,3.042
99,Melissa W.,"Golden, CO",0,4,,4.0,2016-10-03,"I love everything about The Cheesecake Factory: You have a lot of meals you can decide from, the water does not really taste like chlorine (which is a huge plus!! We don't have water that tastes like chlorine in our home country and I don't want to get used to water that tastes like chemicals), the cakes are heavenly good, the waitress was the most nice and patient waitress I've met so far, you get free bread to snack on while deciding on what you want to eat. The only downside is that the meals are on the pricier side. (Burgers around $13, pasta around $16) When I went there this weekend for an early lunch, my friend and I were the first people at the restaurant and could save a good table on the patio. The restaurant fills pretty quickly, so we were lucky to have such a good table. As it was our first time there, it took us longer than usual to go through the menu, because they have so many options. They even have a smaller menu with low calorie meals, which I find is pretty nice. The waitress was very patient with us, because even after 20 minutes of sitting there, looking through the menu, we still couldn't decide on what to eat. She even offered her help to find a meal for my friend, after asking if she's in the mood for burgers, pasta, sandwiches, etc. I asked for a mix of the ""skinnylicious veggie burger"" and the normal veggie burger and without she took my order without questioning it. We both enjoyed our meals and ordered  some cheesecake for dessert. The Oreo cheesecake is heaven on earth! The slices are worth the price of $6.95-7.95! I hardly spend a lot of money on dessert, because I'm pretty specific when it comes to pastries, but I can 100% recommend that cake! We also had the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake, but that one was too heavy for me, even though I love Reese's.

13,Parker B.,"Denver, CO",39,120,144.0,1.0,2016-10-30,"TIME TO GO IN!!! Let me start by exclaiming I would never in any circumstance choose to come to The Cheesecake Factory. This place was in high school one of those places highschool kids took their dates cause it looked classy (inside), and the food was decent (not great, but okay).  My girlfriend while recently out of state tried another location, and found a dish she was recently impressed with, when she came back to CO she tried the dish at a local location on the 16th Street Mall in downtown Denver and was at that time equally satisfied. The dish I'm referring to is the hibachi steak, Wasabi mashed potatoes, with fried asparagus.  We arrived at the 16th Street location around 430pm 10/30/16 and everything just seemed off from the moment we entered the building. To start the ladies waiting to seat people were off in the middle of the restaurant. So when you walk in you're waiting for someone to ask you to be seated at the Desk right near the door, but no one is there, so you just wait. Then if the two ladies aren't too busy talking to one another or looking down from the middle of the restaurant they FLAG you over, just to walk us back the direction we just came from to be seated.  (I saw two people standing there at the front door for so long they, and they were never approached about seating so they just walked out.) We order two plates...  Coullette steak (rare), mashed potatoes, and green beans (my plate). My girlfriend ordered her favorite, and literally the only reason for visiting this restaurant the Hibachi Steak (extra mushrooms) medium, Wasabi mashed potatoes, and fried asparagus (tempura).  My plate comes and I immediately notice that my steak is medium to medium well (if you're a steak lover, this is a major turnoff). Charred as hell on the outside. Mashed is fine, green beans are hard as rocks. Literally, how can you ruin a RARE steak I decide I'm starving, and don't want to send it back as it seemed to take them forever to bring it in the first place (watched my girlfriend polish off the entire damn near basket of bread we were brought waiting for our meals.) I was so hungry I would have literally ate cardboard at this point.  My girlfriend starts to dive into her meal, and notices that the steak she was given in her meal is mostly gristle and fat, she informs the waiter (Dan) and he proceeds to take the entire plate (not just the cruddy steak), we've both been starving while waiting for! Now, all of a sudden a complaint over the steak translates into take confiscate the entire dish... (Thanks Dan!) While she waited another 35 minutes or so for them to fix her another meal (I'm completely done with my food at this point!!!) supposed to be a different cut of steak from a different steak plate, but they were supposed to plate it the exact same way (Hibachi style, same sides).  Didn't really go down that way at all! We received a second server halfway through our meal named ****Stephen****, he was awesome, and offered to try and rectify the situation some (comp'd cheesecake, Thank you for that!), but between the long waits, bad food, and crappy service from the first waiter we were both over it. The manager had came initially and spoke to my girlfriend after the first plate was messed up, but basically encouraged her to just choose another plate ""as he had no way of being able to tell the quality of the other steaks"" for the meal (he had no idea, that this woman was not interested in anything else on their menu).  The manager never revisited the table to see how the replacement meal turned out. I've had better service at Dennys from managers. The second steak was a better cut, but hardly had any mushrooms whatsoever(let alone extra as she had ordered originally), had no tempura asparagus, etc.  Like when you have your appetite set for something in particular and they mess it up, you kinda just want to leave. We waited so long for our check to come we contemplated walking out of the restaurant at least 7 times. Stephen, later gave the issue back to Dan to fix cause I think he was wanting to get away from the issue. I'm almost happy they ruined my girlfriends taste for this spot, maybe I will never have to come back to this God forsaken place again!!! I'm not sure if the kitchen was just off, or what the hell it was going on with the staff, etc. but people don't want to pay their hard earned money for bullshit. Eat here at your own risk, I could think of at least twenty places in this area I could go for a better meal and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver,2.8,3.15,3.216,2.5960000000000005,3.01

The restaurant itself looks good, servers have quite slow service and response. Food is ok.  Here is the real bad thing that happened to me tonight which convinced me to write this such bad experience. After finished my meal, I provided 2 gift cards as I bought from this exact restaurant location at the end of last year to pay for the meal. Ten minutes after I checked, the server came back and informed me that one of the two cards didn't go through. I showed her that I just checked the gift card balance at their cashier just right before I got seated (I also provide her the paper that I received as an evidence of gift card balance checking which was clearly stated everything they need to know to prove that I really had that amount until the server took my card for check). The server then left my table again (about 10 minutes) and came back with acted manager. The manager told me that after he tried every single way to check my gift card on their computer, it still came out that this gift card cannot be used because it had 0 balance in it. He also asked me (not very polite manner) whether I used it after I had checked the balance at their cashier. Wait!? Is that what the manager of the well-known restaurant should ask their customers? It's like I knew that I have already used that card and I still used it to pay for the food. Come on! even little child knows what should he do in this situation. The manager still tried to find out if I misunderstood or I lied by trying to check the balance of the gift card online. Absolutely, he couldn't find anything but the balance was zero. I spend almost 30 minutes at that time to wait for the checked out process and that made me missed the bus to my home. I then tried to figure out by myself that what's really happen to me. So, the first thing I did is to call the gift card department. The gift card representative informed me that the gift card had been charged for the left amount during the period of time that the server brought my card to check. I let the GC representative talked to the manager. Thank god that he didn't accuse me whether that was the real cheesecake factory gift card representative. The truth came up that I told the truth even I didn't know what's really happen to the charging process, I guess it's because of their system or human error. I had never experienced this bad service before since the problem came to the manager, his reaction disappointed me a lot. The manager who suppose to have power and knowledge to manage the situation like this professionally but came up doubting his customers. Such an unprofessional habit of the restaurant manager. I could say that I was very angry at that time. I felt like someone slammed their hand on my face because I want to eat for free. Someone might ask 'Why don't you just simply provide another card for them to charge?'. I will just ask them back 'Why would I paid more since I had already paid them for the gift card?' Was I impatience enough to give them a chance since they already spend more than 30 minutes of my time fixing the problem?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver?start=60,2.76,3.05,3.236,2.468,2.9339999999999997

36,Anthony B.,"Denver, CO",4,8,,1.0,2017-09-19,"TL;DR - Don't order Cheesecake Factory off of Postmates. Let me preface this review by saying we ordered from Postmates, and having worked in the food industry for several years, I'm well aware that you can't judge food from delivery, as you're removing it from it's natural environment. However, I've had both positive experiences with Postmates *and* other Cheesecake Factory locations in the past, and my last experience was not something that left my girlfriend and I wanting to return.  We ordered the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo, a classic dish that so many people have grown to love. Being a former chef and having made this regularly, I reached peak lazy when we resorted to ordering from Postmates at 10pm on a Saturday night. (our first mistake? As I could have whipped up an amazing concoction if I had the materials necessary)... But that's beside the point. Anyway, the first thing we noticed about this dish was that it was not typical of a Cheesecake Factory portion. Normally when I go to Cheesecake, I can leave with more than enough food for two people. Not this time. The next thing we noticed was that our pasta showed up cold. Like really cold. This is one thing I can forgive, as I made the decision to order delivery. However, the chicken was stale, the noodles were barely cooked, and the sauce was non-existent. This pasta, as a born-and-bred Italian, made me want to give up pasta forever and become a leaf-eating vegan. Because I know that this stuff *happens*, I'm going to give Cheesecake another chance to wow me. Whether that's in a year, or 2 weeks, who knows...

0,Ellen K.,"Littleton, CO",88,61,,5.0,2017-11-24,"Please don't disappoint me Cheesecake Factory for giving you five stars. They are FAR from vegan friendly but because they have the Korean BBQ fried cauliflower bits, I will be coming here quite frequently. While the restaurant changes their menu every six months or so, staff told me they'll probably keep the cauliflower bits a LOT longer since they're so popular.  Admittedly I'm not a cauliflower fan but for this dish they are battered in rice flour, baking soda, salt, and pepper, then fried. No egg in the batter. It's been confirmed THREE times by the local restaurant manager, the Boulder CO restaurant, and corporate. The sauce itself is spicy but not fire engine hot. They come to you hot and crispy.  It comes with a ranch dip, which I don't get since it contains animal excretions. But these are so good, it doesn't need a dip. I've shared this on the Denver Vegans page on Facebook, which has more than 3,000 members. So you had better not let us down, Cheesecake Factory! P.S. This visit was to the restaurant at Southwest Plaza in Littleton, not downtown Denver.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver,2.68,2.97,3.208,,2.854
2,Frank L.,"Tucson, AZ",0,29,1.0,2.0,2017-11-26,"I was in Denver for Thanksgiving.  I have not been in Denver for close to 30 years, so my experience at the restaurant becomes emblematic of dining in downtown Denver.  Perusing the many comments on this CF location I know I am just going to repeat the obvious:  uneven food, uneven service.  We had a large group, 10+ people.  Food at one table was brought out 10-15 minutes before the other table.  Our other table was ready to go and I was shoveling food in my mouth to keep up.  My salad was supposed to feature avocado.  It became a game to identify the small chunks of avocado in the salad; maybe there was a slice.  Food at both tables was below standard.  Two meals were comped by management.  All of us received free cheesecake as compensation.  The cheesecake was good. So I can established that my experience was not good, and I can read through the reviews and see that other folks have experienced the same problems; uneven food, uneven service. Beyond blaming the operations of the kitchen the way our server did, I'd like to know what CF is doing to correct these deficiencies, and not just some corporate platitude statement extolling the goals.  Really, what is changing.....?  I would start with slimming down the voluminous menu.  Way to many options and something gets lost when you offer too many selections. So for downtown Denver dining, my one experience is at CF, and that really was not too choice.  Is that representative of dining in Denver?  If so, I head to my favorite places in Tucson or Phoenix.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver,2.72,2.98,3.204,,2.8760000000000003
22,Fe F.,"Denver, CO",12,41,11.0,3.0,2017-11-27,"The cheese cake factory is very overrated. Ive been to this location and feel like the best thing is the dessert. Ive had the food. The spaghetti is always good and mac n cheese, potatoes au gratian delicous. But ive had better chicken and steak. The last time I attended my chicken was unseasoned and very dry that I had to ask for a side of pasta sauce. I had potatoe skins and mac n cheese which were delicious. I also had a steak with mushroom that was a bit over cooked and needed the mushroom sauce...i am of sauces but you cant tell me that the best place to get a burger would be at a sushi bar? Over all i love the Banana and peanutbutter cheese cake. Delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver?start=20,2.72,2.97,3.2,,2.87

1,M J.,"Fresno, CA",1,60,2.0,2.0,2017-12-28,"This was a very disappointing visit to CF. My boyfriend and I were seated right away by friendly staff. We got our drinks and put in our order right away, but that's where it all goes down hill. We ordered an appetizer and our main lunch meals and received our plain bread. (Where did the dark bread go?? Other tables had it?) While waiting for 35-40 minutes, our drinks were not refilled and we didn't get our appetizer but instead, our main lunches arrived. Without any warning regarding the hot plate, my boyfriend burned his arm on his plate twice. Finally, our waitress came up to ask us how our food was. We expressed our frustrated with her regarding the delayed food arrival, lack of appetizer, burned arm, and asked for a manager and more ketchup. Once all of these things arrived (minus the appetizer), we were almost done with our food. Waitress admits she never put in our appetizer order and that she would put it in right away, we told her just don't even put it in at that point. We were starving 45 minutes ago.  Manager came up to talk to us and didn't really seem to have much concern, just a business type ""here I'll comp your one dish and a dessert, we are sorry this happened"" kind of thing. Cool. But we weren't looking for a ""free meal"". It shouldn't have happened in the first place as the restaurant wasn't even busy. After walking by us several times, the waitress should have at least asked if we needed a refill on our drinks or checked on our food since we had been sitting there twiddling our thumbs for over a half an hour. My boyfriend's meal shouldn't have been sitting under the heater for however long it takes to burn someone via plate.  To make things even better, we received the check with a charge on it for our ""comped"" cheesecake slice and were told we had to pay for it because we were comped the appetizer... which we never received.  Once all was said and done, an hour and a half later for a burger and a salad, we finally ended up paying for my meal and our drink, which was great. But left frustrated and with a headache.  Birthday cake cheesecake, however, was the best part of the whole meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver,2.72,2.91,3.184,,2.8340000000000005

No longer chicken on the bone- it is now small cutlets- very dry. They didn't have order ready for delivery driver and it took a really long time. When it finally arrived, food was cold. Mash potatoes were like a brick - worst I've ever had. Called manager to see why it was delayed and he said they forgot to sauce it. He said there was nothing he could do for me since it was ordered through Door Dash. Food was terrible for the price.
