It's easy to forget that it's connected to a shopping mall. My main advice is to there HUNGRY because the portions are absolutely insane.  When my mom and I go to Jordan Creek for a shopping day (usually an annual occasion) the Cheesecake Factory is the only restaurant we even consider anymore. (In the past, we have given PF Changs a chance, and the Italian place that I can't even remember the name of, but these always leave us with an emptiness that only CF can fill.) As for the food itself, there are great options, but keep in mind this is not a ""light"" choice. Even the salads are ginormous! But overall you really can't go wrong. I LOVE the ahi tuna salad! It was delicious but didn't leave me ""sick to my stomach"" full. Honestly, that's the cheesecakes job. Ah the cheesecake. Seriously, even if you eat lunch somewhere else (shame on you) I highly reccomend that you stop here for dessert. I DONT EVEN REALLY LIKE CHEESECAKE. But this, this is a whole new level. There are so many flavors to choose from, you really can never go wrong! It is also great to share since they are so rich. My mom and I always struggle to finish a slice together, it takes teamwork for sure! I love the raspberry chocolate mousse, but there is always another on the menu that is on my list to try next!

53,Erik Y.,"Lincoln, NE",93,251,307.0,3.0,2015-01-09,"Love the Cheesecake Factory.  The food is excellent but I have a few issues with this location.  First, its small for Cheesecake Factory standards.  The one in Omaha is bigger, and the one in Kansas City is more then double this location size.  This would not be a problem if it wasn't so busy all the time.   That said, the food is good and everything is consistent with every other Cheesecake Factory around the country I have eaten out.  Typical Lunch + Drink will cost you at least $15 a person on average.  Add another $8 if you add a cheesecake so its not exactly a cheap place for Lunch, and even more for dinner.  They do have a huge menu with a lot of good options.  Most of the items are carb heavy though, so if your on a low carb diet you have to hunt a little for something.  The portions are huge.  Its not uncommon for my wife and I to split 1 appetizer and 1 entrée and be full by the end of Dinner. And now for the cheesecakes.  Yes I have tried nearly every flavor at one point or another over the last 20+ years visiting a cheesecake factory someplace in the country.  In fact I visited my first one in Newport Beach, CA back in 1990.  I'm not even sure if its still there!  But, over the years I have developed a taste for a few of them, and can rank them in what I believe is their worst, to their best.  Here we go: 32. Low Carb Cheesecake with Strawberries  - Yuck 31. White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut  - Not a fan of white chocolate with caramel. 30. Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake  Coffee in dessert is not my thing.  Yuck. 29. Tiramisu  I'll stick with the original, and I don't really like coffee in my desserts. 28. Pineapple Upside-Down Cheesecake  Not very good 27. The Original  Boring 26. Chocolate Mousse  Not a fan of mousse. I want a better chocolate. 25. White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle  This one is ok, but again, not a fan of white chocolate 24. Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple  Not bad, but they have better 23. The Original with Cherry Preserves  The original is good, and cherry makes it a little better 22. Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake  I like carrot cake, but this one is a miss 21. Key Lime  I like it, but it's a weee bit tart 20. Ultimate Red Velvet Cake  Getting better on the chocolate front but they have better 19. Mango Key Lime  This is a good option for tart and sweet. 18. Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake  This is a good one, worth trying. 17. Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake  Reminds me of banana cream pie, but better 16. Pina Colada Cake  Different take. I feel like I'm in the islands 15. Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake  Love me a turtle in any way. This is a good option 14. Vanilla Bean Cheesecake  For something so simple, it works.  Tastes like rich vanilla ice cream. 13. Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel  Apple Pie Cheesecake.  It is good 12. Wild Blueberry White Chocolate Cheesecake  This is the only white chocolate cheesecake I actually like 11. Chocolate Tuxedo Cream  Vanilla and Chocolate twist.  Very good 10. Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore  This is one of my favorites.  Worth getting for sure. 9. Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake  If you want chocolate, this one is great, but almost TOO much chocolate. it's fairly dark chocolate. 8. The Original with Fresh Strawberries  A classic, and very very good. 7. Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake.  The best peanut butter cake I have had in some time.  Great if you don't want a cheesecake 6. 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake  Probably the best chocolate item they have.  perfect flavors 5. Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough  I am so partial to chocolate chip cookie dough anything, and this cheesecake is excellent. 4. OREO Dream Extreme  If you like Oreo's, you will love this cheesecake.  I do. 3. Lemon Raspberry Cream  When you are sick of chocolate, this sweet and tart cheesecake is perfect.  My favorite fruit cheesecake they have.  2. Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake  This is also probably the best chocolate item they have. Honestly, this and the 30th aniv chocolate cake are both fantastic, but this one is readily available everywhere. 1. Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake  This is the best of the best.  German Chocolate, coconut, pecan frosting, omg, this thing is the bomb.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-des-moines?start=60,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.9880000000000004,3.5200000000000005

On Monday, I picked up a piece of cheesecake to celebrate a job promotion.  The first forkful had one short white hair in it, like the kind you would find on a cat or a rat. I pulled it out, and didn't think much more about it. Two forkfuls later I found three more of these hairs! Ick! So at that point, I torn the piece apart and found many more of these cat/rat hairs!!! I emailed The Cheesecake Factory to voice my concern. I then got very, very sick... at work. I have yet to hear from The Cheesecake factory. It is obvious, by their lack of response, that they do not care about quality or their customer. Thanks, but no thanks.

43,Sherry B.,"West Des Moines, IA",1,15,2.0,4.0,2015-04-13,"This is one of our favorite places to go in the area. The food and service are generally very good. They have good selections for lower calorie meals as well. This is a great place to go for a nice evening out, or a relaxing lunch or dinner on the patio. And of course there are the desserts, which don't consist of only cheesecake. Their strawberry shortcake is amazing, and one of my personal favorites is a simple bowl of strawberries and whipped cream. The negatives: Avoid the table/booth combo seating if you are on a date or want any kind of privacy. The drinks aren't very good so don't waste your money.  I don't care for their coffee.

Just a couple examples of what I have tried over the years.  The larger menu items are enough to feed two or have leftovers to bring to lunch the next day and make your coworkers jelaous. Along with the menu items, we have both tried a variety of their cheesecakes.   This is the hardest part, which one to get each time.  My husband's fave is no longer offered, coconut cream pie cheesecake, but we are both chocolate fans and there are a few to choose from under that category. Godiva and s' mores may be my two faves.

His response was ""they are baking it fresh"" I said still? He then precedes to show us a phone pic of no bread on a tray in the kitchen. I thought that was rude as his snide comments were getting old. Then the food came and still no bread (15 min and still baking and ridiculous)  and it never came.

Normally, I am a fan of The Cheesecake Factory restaurants around the U.S. and take visitors there because everyone can find something they like on the restaurant's extensive menu, but Harrlie ruined my last visit and hurt the restaurant's image. During a trip back to DSM, I stopped in to pick up a couple pieces of cheesecake and chocolate sauce to go after shopping at Jordan Creek Mall.  Before I could even get the second flavor of cheesecake out of my mouth, Harrlie said, ""Is that all?""   Me:  Yes, did you get the second one. Harrlie:  Yea, is that all? (Again, on the heels of what I was saying.) Me:  And, I'd like a small container of chocolate sauce. Harrlie: Is that all? (Once more, cutting me off.) Me:  Yes. Ok, so this might sound standard, but the way she spoke to me was condescending and hurried, as if she had better things to do and I was getting in her way. After I had received the cheesecake and was walking to my car in the 90-something degree heat, I noticed that Harrlie had forgotten the chocolate sauce.  I went back inside to get it and she made me wait until she helped the 5 people in front of me to ask me what else I wanted - again, as if she had better things to do than to take my order. People in Iowa are thought to be exceptionally nice and friendly, but not that gal.  I have never had such a sour experience at any of The Cheesecake Factory's around the U.S., the last being in Miami just a week ago.  They were slammed with guests, but no one showed their stress and, certainly, not a single person snapped at me or anyone in our group.

Its not always my first choice for restaurants out in the Jordan Creek area but this wasn't my turn to pick.  The waitress took little to get to us but once she did.... well... lets say I wish I remembered her name. She was overly sweet, helpful and cheerful. She made us all smile and kept a close eye on us. Any request was quickly taken care of. Kudos to her! She was one in a million with really good service on her part. I think they needed to rethink the design of the restaurant. The arched ceiling make for a louder than needed ambiance. I felt like all the sound echoed and carried more than it should have. The radio could be turned down so I didn't have to raise my voice or the waitress struggle to hear my order. I decided to try and eat decent. (ha) Skinnylicious Caesar Salad: Romaine Lettuce, Croutons, Parmesan Cheese and Our Special Caesar Dressing. If you are a light eater - ASK FOR THE HALF SIZE.  I didn't realize that this thing would come out on a plate bigger than my head. I hate to waste food. I had to box over half of this salad up. Waitress said even on this menu I would have had to requested a lunch size.. HOW is this Skinnylicious at this monstrous portion? Just saying.  Somehow my lunch buddy got a half size on hers, ... which was the same thing.. without the chicken. We could have shared the salad.  However she ONLY got the salad cause they were out of the Turkey Burger (fail) . My other lunch buddy got a pasta with shrimp. I cant remember the name but she really enjoyed it cause it was inhaled and gone!  Last of course, we left room for cheese cake. The only down side is they have just ONE choice for gluten free cheesecakes on the giant list. Good news it was the Godiva Chocolate Cheese cake. Holy mother of chocolaty goodness. It's so rich that the three of us could not finish it and, oh darn, had to take it home too.  So my feed back overall: 1. Service from this waitress: excellent- again wish I remembered her name.  2.

Few more visit, it was just plain horrible and one time we just decided to just leave and go somewhere else. One time we came here for one of my friend's birthday since there were more than 6 in our group, we tried to see if we can make the reservation but no luck. The most recent visit was a few weeks ago since we were all craving for cake, we came here to get some Craigs carrot cake, Red Velvet cake, or whatever they have really. There was no line at the take-out area. We have told the guy what we wanted to get and to our surprise it took them 20 minutes to put a cake in a box. Yes, it was 20mins and we not even exaggerating. When we ask how long will it take we always get ""in a bit"".  That was 20 minute for something that I was looking at through refrigerated pastry case. My daughter asked to go to the bathroom and came back, still no cake. When I was about to leave the lady called out my name, paid for it and left. It was just horrible. To be fair, we did like their Louisianna Chicken, though they put way too much sauce. We came home and ate the cake. It was not the same carrot cake that I like. I don't remember it being too moist or tasting so differently. The cake was not fluffy as well. Same as with the red velvet. We just  threw it away coz it tasted nasty.

You shouldn't be, it shows how much a business cares about all of their customers.  Their GF menu is off the charts, and they'll generally make everything to fit your needs - whether you have allergies or not. Extra sauce? Sure. Cook with oil instead of butter? Definitely. Generally the staff is really friendly and knowledgeable, but if they don't know, they'll ask.  My normal choices are the 4 cheese pasta (without cheese), or the old fashioned burger with a gluten free bun. They toast the bun and it is fantastic. Their burgers are large and really filling, with a few interesting choices. Fries are a good choice, because any substitution is charged ala carte (not the best business, IMO...), but you have to ask them to dedicate a fryer. Celiacs- remember that. As for the rest of the menu, they've got what seems like hundreds of choices that are all made well and my husband likes most of them.

Much better than a slice of American cheese in my mind. Before that, we ordered the tator tot bite things as our appetizer. I know the texture is supposed to be mushy, but the mushy combined with the crispy fried idea clashed a little. The bread was very good, but inconsistent with its temperature. We got one piece of warm, soft bread and three or four pieces of cold, hard bread. I would have loved some more warm and soft bread, with spreadable butter, not frozen butter! Similar to the food, the drinks were tasty. I got a whiskey sour, and OH BOY! It was overly sour, but I think it was mixed by a newbie, so that's ok. The drinks were INCREDIBLY OVERPRICED! I should never have to pay $22.00 for two drinks at a restaurant. That was ridiculous. We also passed on the actual cheesecake as well, because of their outrageous price per slice. $7 for a slice of cheesecake??!! Very disappointed with their menu prices.

The waitstaff is really good about giving recommendations if you can't decide. And they are quick at knowing when you need a refill or anything else. This place has great food dishes with healthy servings and recommended if you're in the Jordan Creek area. The amount of food you get with each dish makes this place even better. Expect it to be fairly loud during peak business hours. And they pack you in pretty tightly. If you decide to re-arrange to a different table, because you don't want to be touching elbows, they are usually pretty good about it.  Tucked into the Jordan Creek Mall, this place has many people come through the doors. No reservations of course because what's the point in that?

When I did figure it out, I ordered their lemon shrimp pasta but asked to have linguini or spaghetti instead of the angel hair. He said ok but still brought it out with angel hair. I asked to speak to a manager,. The manager immediately knew what was wrong so the waiter had to know he was giving me the wrong thing. The manager apologized but was not genuinely apologetic.  He offered to remake the dinner with linguini.  After about 20 minutes my dinner arrived but the shrimp was over cooked. I ate it anyway.

87,Mark H.,"Ames, IA",4,143,8.0,4.0,2017-10-07,"My wife and I live in Ames and don't get down to Des Moines all that often, but we had some errands to run there today and decided to visit this restaurant while there, since I had never been there. Based on our experience, I think it likely that in the future we will make a special trip to Des Moines just to eat here. Soon after being seated, our cokes came along with a basket of very good bread and butter. I had the crusty French bread, which appeared to be part of a bagette, and my wife had what looked like some kind of oat bread that she thought was very good. A second basket was cheerfully provided upon request at no extra charge.  I had the chicken parmesan ""pizza style"" (it should really be spelled ""chicken parmigiana"") , which is an unusual dish: chicken is pounded until it is very thin, shaped into a disc, then breaded and served with melted cheese and tomato sauce. It comes out looking like a pizza, with the ""crust"" being the chicken, with a large ball of pasta sitting on top of it. It was delicious, and didn't suffer from a problem that I have had with chicken parmigiana in the past, which is too-thick chicken. The portion was huge; the disc covered an entire plate. My wife had the chicken Riesling, which she also loved: this was chicken with Riesling white wine cream sauce, along with bacon, onions and mushrooms. I had a few bites of her meal and agree that it was excellent. I'm not a mushroom fan and was glad to see that it had more bacon than mushrooms; my wife would have preferred it the other way. Her portion was also generous, though not as huge as mine; we both took about half home for leftovers.  We also splurged and split a dessert, Linda's fudge cake. Chocolate cake lovers will enjoy this: multiple layers of excellent chocolate cake with fudge frosting on top and between the layers, served with an extra-large dollop of whipped cream. Although we both loved it, we also couldn't finish it and wound up taking about half of it home, too. We both agree that in the future, given the quantity of food that is served here, we'll probably skip dessert, but we were curious about it and wanted to try it this time. Photos of our entrees and dessert, courtesy of my wife, are attached. On the basis of the food and waitress quality alone, I would likely give this restaurant five stars, but three circumstances conspired to knock the rating down one star. First was a timeliness issue. We arrived a few minutes after the restaurant opened and although there were still many open tables, we had to wait about four or five minutes to be seated. (A word to the wise: when we left at about 12:30, the place was already mobbed; this was on a Saturday afternoon and perhaps the restaurant is not that crowded on a weekday.) The brief wait to be seated was not that big a deal, but, after ordering, we also had to wait quite a while for our meals, to the point where our waitress told us that she would check to see where the food was. My second quibble concerns the size of the restrooms. They seem too small for a restaurant of this size and mealtime population, and indeed the ladies' room had substantial lines when my wife used it. I suspect that people from Jordan Creek Mall who were not dining here were coming in to use the restrooms.  Finally, there is the price. Our entrees ($14.50 for mine, $13.95 for my wife's) were not cheap but did not seem unreasonably expensive, but our dessert seemed a bit high at $8.50 and our cokes, at $3.25 each, were probably the most expensive beverages I've had in any restaurant in recent memory. All told our lunch, with tax and tip, cost almost $55, which seems rather high for central Iowa. But, given the quantity and quality of food that we had, the price will not deter us from eating here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-des-moines,3.64,3.53,3.53,,3.5740000000000003
83,Charles S.,"Iowa City, IA",8,85,2.0,5.0,2017-10-09,"Okay, so maybe there isn't a new chef as I'm unsure of their turnover.  However, there was definitely a positively delightful new experience at the West Des Moines, Iowa location of the ever popular Cheesecake Factory! For the first time, in a very long time, the Cajun chicken littles were not over cooked.  They were just simply scrumptious!  A delight to eat.  This is my all around favorite at CCF to enjoy when visiting WDM to get away from the frantic football ""hot mess"" in Iowa City. The waitress was super polite and attentive.  The bread/butter service was super-duper.  The new way to do the butter (slice instead of individual packets) was a homerun.   Yeah!  Go Team CCF!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-des-moines,3.64,3.55,3.55,,3.5860000000000003
84,Michaela E.,"Winterset, IA",0,8,7.0,2.0,2018-01-02,Wait was forever to get a meal that was over priced and less than great tasting. If you are looking for cheesecake to go this would be fine. For an actual meal you would be better off to go into the mall and get something.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-des-moines,3.52,3.52,3.52,,3.5200000000000005
