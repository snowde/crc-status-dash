My wife, then later my brother, said it was a bad choice on my part - ""I wouldn't get a burger unless the place was known for them...etc"" to which I replied ""Anyone who charges $12 for a burger should make one worth it or take it off the menu"".

I shared a Thai Lettuce Wraps app with a couple of people and it was absolutely delicious. It was recommended to me by a friend who goes to the Cheesecake Factory a lot as the one of the best appetizers and she was definitely on the money. There were enough wraps and ingredients to make 6 wraps and my manager had it as an entree just to give you an idea of the portion sizes.  I had the Rib Eye and Mashed Potatoes for an entree and unfortunately I was very very underwhelmed by the Rib Eye, hence the reluctant 3 star rating. But the Mashed Potatoes were absolutely heavenly. I'm sure it's because it's loaded with butter but I would definitely recommend it. The portion was also big enough for 3 meals. I got the Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake, but I think the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake or Tower Cake is better. From previous experiences, I'd also recommend the Herb Crusted Salmon and Chicken Madeira.  The Southpoint location was very empty for lunch, but it definitely gets crowded at dinner time. We got excellent service and our waiter was funny to boot. The bill was pretty high for lunch but I always think that the portion size at the Cheesecake Factory justifies the price tag.

Nice touch. I always like places that take any extra step for someones birthday- especially when you are paying $$. The only thing that sucks is really the drink prices.

She was very friendly and seemed knowledgeable of menu items on the extensive menu. Speaking of menu, it's overwhelming!  I ordered a draft beer, and had I known they charged $5.75 I would've thought twice about it. Ridiculously overpriced for a Fat Tire, if you ask me.  For dinner I ordered the Chicken Lettuce Wraps (Asian style) from the ""Skinny-licious"" menu, and was very impressed with the flavor. It was a big enough serving to fill me up, it was well-prepared, and something I'd definitely order again. My friend had a few appetizers and seemed happy with her meal.

They seem to have low turnover, so you'll see the same friendly folks often. I've tried lots of the dishes on the menu and they've all been good to very good. Particular favorites are the (unhealthy) Mexican egg roll (on the appetizer menu, but it will make a meal) and the pear and endive salad off the Skinnylicious menu. I didn't feel especially manly ordering the Skinnylicious salad, but it was really good and knowing that it was under 600 calories was a plus. In addition, it was a nice portion, which is a change from some low-cal menus where you get an ounce of food.

You must try the avocado eggrolls and order double tamarind sauce for dipping. It is amazing and we order this every time. I skip around the menu as it's so large and there are so many delicious choices. The pasta carbonara is my favorite pasta choice. It's huge! I have to say though, my all time favorite dish is the hibachi ribeye! It is beyond perfection! Medium rare, seasoned flank steak, covered in marinated and sauteed mushrooms, onions, sprouts and cilantro. Sweet Asian inspired sauce and mashed potatoes with wasabi butter on top. It is mouth-watering! This is one of my and my husband's favorite date spots. Kids are welcome but we opt not to bring ours. We normally don't have room for cheesecake but the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake is amazing. The chocolate torte (not sure that's what it's called... chocolate cake.

178,Rebecca T.,"Durham, NC",1,2,,1.0,2015-04-05,"Really unimpressed with my dinner this evening. LOADS of flies infesting the place, cold food, waitresses MIA and disinterested management. My niece and I stopped in for an early dinner around 4pm and were ready to order almost immediately, but the waitress kept inexplicably walking away. I asked for water, and was about to give our order, but she walked away to get the water. While she was doing that, my niece said she wanted a cherry soda. When she got back with the water, I asked if they had cherry soda. She offered a Shirley Temple, which was fine by me. Then she walked away again before I could order the food we wanted. THEN when she got back with my niece's drink, I asked if that could be considered the soda for the kids' meal. She said yes, and it came with refills - great! I ended up switching my order to the Miso Salmon on her recommendation, which was just okay, definitely not great. The food took a really long time to arrive for such a non-busy time, especially given how little time it takes to  cook salmon. My niece actually fell asleep while we were waiting, after trying unsuccessfully to shoo several flies away from our table. My fish was lukewarm at best when it arrived at the table, though my niece loved her (huge) serving of mac & cheese. I asked our waitress for an extra order of snow peas on the side because I'd assumed the notation ""with snow peas"" in the menu meant a serving of snow peas, not five peas for garnish, as it turned out. My peas never came. Neither did I get a chance to ask for a lemon wedge for my fish, which was a little bland in addition to being cold. My niece's drink had also been empty and awaiting a refill for some time. I was practically standing up on the bench looking for the waitress, who was nowhere in sight, though I saw other waiters appear and disappear a few times. We actually ended up leaving our table because the flies were getting more numerous, and I heard other diners commenting as well. When she finally came back I just asked for a box and the check, though I'd planned to get a cocktail and share a dessert with my niece when I walked in, and even just that took a while. I asked to speak to a manager as a left, who gave me lip service and took off the price of the kids' meal as a courtesy, though I noticed afterwards that the Shirley Temple had been charged in addition to the kids's meal instead of being counted as the drink. I did not feel that she really listened to my concerns about all the flies or the non-attendant service, and just fed me a whole bunch of canned lines like, ""I'm sorry to hear that, ma'am"" with a tight smile and glazed eyes. I've had okay experiences here before, but never a great one, and this was my first REALLY BAD experience.

The restaurant is huge and somehow always has a minimum of a 30 minute wait on the weekends (during dinner time). There were flies in the restaurant which was distasteful.  Food: Best thing is the bread that comes out for a starter. The last few times that we've been here the food has been a miss. My go-to is the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi combination and the first time I'd had it, my mouth was watering for more. Recently, it just hasn't hit the spot. My family reacted in the same manner to their dishes (Tuscan Chicken and Fish Tacos). The Tuscan Chicken was dry and not marinated well, although the balsamic vinaigrette sauce is well-made. The fish tacos were not impressive at all, I'd recommend you don't order it at all. Hardly any fish, you're paying for lettuce and tasteless mini tortillas.  Service: Service is attentive but nothing spectacular. For the price I'm paying for these entrees, I expect a more professional and engaging service. Our table was missing silverware and small plates that all the tables should already have ready.  Overall, I honestly won't come again. I can get better service and food over at other places for a cheaper price.

Our most recent experience was on a Friday night, so naturally Southpoint was a total nightmare with people all over the place. The wait for Cheesecake was 40 minutes, and it took that long, maybe a little less. Once we were seated, our waitress came and took drink orders. I got up to go to the restroom and almost fell down because the floor was so slippery (not in the bathroom--in the restaurant itself!). Understand that I'm pretty in shape and don't usually fall, but I found myself walking very cautiously to avoid a fall. Not cool. Anyway, we got our bread after asking a few waiters, and our appetizers shortly thereafter. The ahi tuna was phenomenal, and the guacamole was good as well. I will say, though, that the heat was not spread in the guac evenly, so one bite was hot and the next wasn't. My meal was the SkinnyLicious steak with some veggies. It was pretty darn good. Not too much food, which was perfect for what I was expecting. I'd get it again. Service was really slow but very kind. Our waitress was so sweet but a little forgetful. The people at the cheesecake counter were great. I got the new Salted Caramel Cheesecake which was pretty good (I think red velvet is still better...).

The bread that comes out before your meal is actually really good! I tend to fill up on the bread by accident here, ha!  I usually go for the bowtie pasta with the chicken (don't remember the actual name), because I know it's good and it's cheap. It's a very heavy dish because it's drenched in a creamy sauce. The portions are huge! I usually split a dish with my BF. If you have room for dessert, then please do get a slice of cheesecake. And one slice is perfect for 2! All the ones I've ever tried are so delicious and dense.  The service here is alright, it can get a bit slow and we've had a forgetful waitress in the past. We ordered a beer and it never came out, which the waitress repeatedly apologized for.

We did so for a party of 20.  They were waiting on a certain table to leave to sit our party.  At 7:20 they agreed to partially seat our party because there were several children with us. At 7:45 we had to flag a server down to order the children's food. Our drinks were always empty. We had to ask or remind them the adults hadn't ordered.  Took over 30 mins to get our cheesecakes we ordered and check.  I understand it was our choice to eat at a place with a large party without a reservation but the poor service and the lack of any ""service recovery"" for this horrible experience is inexcusable.

117,S S.,"Kitty Hawk, NC",1,115,28.0,1.0,2016-03-06,Tried to take my wife out to dinner since we are always on the go and felt like spoiling ourself a. Well that was a mistake.  We were seated in less time then the hostess said which was a positive for sure since they were busy. But it went downhill from there.  After being seated it seemed like it took over 10 minutes for our server Kenneth to come acknowledge us. At that time we placed our drink order and an appetizer order to help move things along and prevent longer delays. After Kenneth returned with out drinks he took our order.  A while later a food server dropped our appetizer off for us to enjoy which actually was good. We had the fried mozzarella. Then we never saw our server for a very long time. Our drinks needed refills and we had been finished with our appetizer for quite some time and started wondering where our food was. After another 20 minutes we noticed a table that was sat after us received their meal. Since our server was not attentive to our table we couldn't inquire what the holdup was.   Finally after almost 30 minutes a good runner came to deliver meals to the table to our right which they had been finished and we're waiting on the same server to bring them their bill. I heard the order and said I ordered that and she said no it's for this table. They advised her she was wrong they were waiting on their bill and she proceeded to drop the order on our table when they got my wife's order wrong. So she picked up the order and said she would recheck where this was going but asked what my wife ordered.  Finally Kenneth showed up to the table finished eating and we inquired about our order and explained the mess up. He was like oh let me check on it. I also asked at that time for refills and Said the people to our left already received their meals and said not sure what's up. Then it fell apart from there.  Kenneth started to make smart remarks to me and I said you can bring the manager over and one was walking by and he called the gentleman over. I advised him that Kenneth hasn't been doing his job and attentive to his tables. The manager said this was the first he heard of this and would check on our order. Kenneth came back to refill our drinks and said you must be thirsty and he was here to refill our drinks since he hasn't been doing anything tonight. I said you can find us another service and to watch his smart remarks I was out to enjoy a dinner not have poor service.  Needless to say our night was ruined by poor customer no service at this location. My wife enjoyed her meal I can't say the same. The manager never came back to apologize or offer anything to us.

76,Lauren R.,"Manhattan, NY",184,121,204.0,3.0,2016-03-12,"The Cheesecake Factory is always good, but if you ask me it's a little overrated. It's location is ideal at Southpoint Mall, and it is one of the better options to eat at the mall. The inside is huge and dark, and the outdoor seating is perfect for the warm spring and summer nights. Beware of the wait times here on the weekends. I'm pretty sure every time I have been, there's always a wait. Depending on how big your party is, the waiting time usually goes by quick and there's plenty to walk around and see while waiting at the mall.  The menu is huge. This is definitely one of those places where I stick to the same order every time, simply because I do not want to look through the menu. My usual is the Asian chicken salad, which never disappoints. The salad is HUGE. I usually have enough left over to last me for two more meals. They give a lot of chicken and peanuts, and the sesame Asian salad dressing is delicious.  Last night, I went with an order of the avocado egg rolls to share, and I changed it up with the chopped Cobb salad, without the bacon. The avocado egg rolls are delicious. A must order appetizer. They're crunchy, and the avocado is fresh and tasty. To make it even better, they serve it with an avocado dipping sauce dressing that was so good. My salad was good, but I liked my usual Asian salad better. It had a lot of apples and blue cheese in it, and the lettuce was shredded which I liked. The chicken pieces were small and there wasn't that much meat in the salad.  The service here isn't the quickest. The waitress was nice about it though and said the kitchen was a little slow several times and assured us the food would be out soon. However, a salad is so quick to make so I'm not sure what took so long.  My favorite part of dining here is the bread. The brown bread they serve is delicious! I could eat the whole loaf before dinner is even served. Save some room for some cheesecake to make the meal even better. The cheesecake menu is endless, and the cheesecakes are all good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=20,3.2,3.17,3.17,3.0840000000000005,3.182

So glad we decided to go.  Started with the crispy crab wontons. The dipping sauce was light and tangy which paired great with the crispy fried crab wontons.  They had great crab flavor.  I got the chicken and biscuits which is the most comforting dish. It was like the insides of the best chicken pot pie ever with the best buttermilk biscuit ever on top. Out of the world decadent comfort food and MASHED POTATOES. Carb heaven.  My husband had a pesto pasta. I don't recall the name but it was a crispy chicken with prosciutto and an arugula salad on top. Simply Devine.  Of course we saved room for cheese cake.  We actually got our own piece!  We always just share dessert but not today! I had the lemon raspberry. It was so refreshing, tart, and creamy.  Hubby had the salted caramel-OMG good.

169,Marvin S.,"Durham, NC",9,40,3.0,2.0,2016-05-07,"The Cheesecake Factory, the halllowed halls of the world renowned cheesecake. We've all heard the stories of their fine cuisine and their better-than-sex desserts. I used to go to the one in Raleigh (Glenwood Ave locale) and it was decent, not bad. So I was in the neighborhood at Southpoint last night, date night with the wife. Dinner and a movie, thought we'd start at TCF. I read reviews prior to goingm as I was curious, this being my first time at this location. One reviewer mentioned that their waiter never smiled. So after we arrived and waited 15 minutes for our table, we were finally seated. The person who escorted us, some goofy six foot tall lug of a guy with the personality of a potted palm and never smiled. For a matter of fact, as I watched the employees... sunnuvagun, there were few people who smiled. I know there were easily 10 waiers/servers, a few busboys, and a manager who seemed to look through people instead of smiling and greeting the customers in passing. No smiles... dangnest thing I have seen, So anyway we were seated at our table. First thing I noticed was the table as dirty. No no, not dirty plates on the table, I mean grime and filth on the table! Encrusted with the last ten people's food or whatever. That was gross! I took some of the water from my water glass, dipped my napkin in it and cleaned the table myself. But I wrote this off as them being busy. Afterall, this is THE Cheesecake Factory. I ordered the burger, but I wanted something else but was afraid, due to our time crunch, something beyond a burger may through the kitchen in a panick and delay my food by half an hour. So I did a burger and mashed potatoes (can't stand greasy fries!). My wife ordered the salad with grilled chicken. I should take a moment to spotlight the only bright spot in my experience... Jazmine. She was a delight. Smiled, very personable, she was the only reason we did not just get up and leave. IMO, try to get in Jazmine's area when you visit, she and one other waitress were the only ones who seemed to smile and was pleasant. And believe me, I was watching! We were there for 45 minutes, and of everyone there, only two peope... sorry, I was going on a tangent. My burger was a crispy critter when it came out (24 minutes after ordering). It came on a wheat bun, which was ok. All of the necessary condiments and accrumon was right. My wife's salad was wrong....how do you mess up a grilled chicken salad? They forgot the chicken. So tack on another minute or two for the lovely and takented Jazmine to go back there, kick their rocks to get some chicken as ordered! We also got the dessert... and one would seriously hope they couldn't muck up their signature dish. We got the low carb cheese cake, with a side of strawberries (fresh) and whipped cream (made there?). All delicious as it should be.  As I was paying the check, i Noticed the guy at the next table left and the busboy came and cleared off the table before resetting. But wait.... one tiny little thing was missed. He never washed the table, not a single wet rag, spray bottle, nothing. Just took the plates and such away, then set it back up with another set of plates, glasses, etc.  No wonder our table was cruded up... unclean.... because they do not clean the tables! GROSS!

I moved here and tried this location and was very very disappointed. My cousin was in town on vacation and it was her first night. We want here. My husband and I got our food and then 5 mins later she got hers. She asked for a medium well steak, cut into it and it was pure blood . The waiter asked if he could take the steak and go cook it more. It was already burnt on the outside but the inside was blood. She need a whole new steak . He seemed he had an issue with trying to get her a whole new steak done the right way and she wanted new sides as well(so they would not get cold) It took 30 mins. My Hubby and I did not want to eat our food while she waited on her new plate. Our food was then cold waiting for her food. There is. I reason why it should take that long. It should of been on the fly. We wanted a nice dinner and they ruined it. But that's not the end . My husband ordered the Jamaican plate and it was missing the platanos (my husband told the waiter, he didn't even know ) my plate came out with Coleslwa when I told the waiter not to include it, but I still got it.  The waiter did not ask if we even wanted to speak to a manager after all this, so I had to ask. She came to apologize and it was not really sincere in my opinion. I guess she apologiez for the food, but she didn't realize that they ruined the whole night. She took off the steak plate off the Menu and gave my husband a free cheesecake . I feel that my whole meal should of been free because this was the worst team restaurant experience of my life and that sad part is is that it was at my fav place to eat.

We had to flag her down after sitting there for about 15 minutes. The waitress was a tall blond older lady that was somewhat pleasant though not overly nice as if she were distracted. Since we had so much time to go over the menu we went ahead and ordered our drinks, appetizers and entrees at the same time fearing we wouldn't be able to track her down again. Drinks came pretty quickly but the bread took another 15 minutes and then the appetizer of the sampler egg roll plate came about 10 minutes after that. After another 20 minutes our entrees came. Husband ordered parmesan herb crusted chicken and I ordered the combination plate of chicken madeira and steak diane. The egg roll sampler was great with 4 different types with sauces. The parmesean chicken was hot and flavorful and huge. My combo plate had a good taste but was only lukewarm. I didn't send it back for fear it would be another hundred years to get it back.

49,Michael G.,"Seattle, WA",7,285,,1.0,2016-12-09,"Typically consistency would be one of the primary expectations I would have for any Cheesecake branch within the large national chain.  Well, this branch has ruined that expectation.  Two visits ago, my wife and I both came down with stomach trouble the early evening after eating lunch at this restaurant.  I suspected a linkage because we always shared our dishes at this restaurant. Then, on our last visit, one of the meals served from the kitchen was absolutely hideous in terms of really poor meat quality that was way oversized and not cut anywhere close to the usual standard size for the dish.  It was extremely gristly and unusually overloaded with large chunks of fat.  We both were lucky that we did not choke on the gross meat that we ultimately had to spit out onto the plate.   It was totally inexcusable, disgusting, and it has completely destroyed my trust in the kitchen there, to serve something so obviously bad like that to customers. I have never seen such large variation in quality at a cheesecake factory branch before.  I am very sad that I will have to stay away from a chain I have liked for many years due to the very poor kitchen performance and substandard quality at this branch.  The disappointment in the poor food quality was actually so big that we could not even accept any offers to try to fix it.  When a restaurant messes up so bad, I just do not want to even give them another chance.  I care too much about my health and well being.  I also share the disappointment in the management of this branch like other customers, as they did not seem to adequately listen to me or meet my expectations in handling the very unfortunate quality issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=60,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.7880000000000003,3.2000000000000006

My fiancé arrived early first to get us a table and have our appetizer and drink ready as I was working late and on the way. He requested for us to have a booth table, however the hostess then informed him that there were no booth tables available and we could be seated either at a bar high top or at the happy hour table. Disappointed, but understanding, he selected the high top bar table only to discover that many booth tables were available.  He was able to identify a manager and asked why he was told no booth tables were available for our preference and sat at a small bar high top. Right when I was arriving, the manager was surprised and happy to accommodate us to our preferred seat. She was glad to help.  The hostess began expressing much attitude and physically gesturing toward us while talking about us to a group of employees causing us to feel uncomfortable and quite frankly unwanted for our service. The manager came over and we kindly asked for her to please correct the situation as it was beginning to escalate and cause discomfort. The manager did pull her off the floor but eventually came back.  Silver lining, our waitress, Ifey, was an amazing superstar and make sure we were happy entertained and comfortable donating the night. We could not have been happier with her attention to us.  The reason I am providing a review of one star is because the manager never came back to check on us after the situation happened. There was no courtesy discount provided, though we did not expect to have one.  It sends us the message that the hostess' behavior was acceptable. It questions our loyalty as frequent diners to our favorite restaurant moving forward.

Mine was missing corn, black beans, and DRESSING. We had to stalk down the waitress to tell her what was happening and then she asked if she should just bring me a side of black beans. Um, no?

I like the colurful cieling paitings. Plenty of nice outdoor seating. Our table was a bit dirty, when we asked our server to clean it he just wiped it off with a napkin from another table as opposed to cleaning it properly. There are too many menu options on three different menus! It would take me an hour to properly read through the menu. Two types of complimentary bread served before the meal. The dark bread is good.  The chicken and shrimp dish with pineapple and light honey flavoured batter was very good, mixed with snow peas and shittake mushrooms. But for a dish with pineapple in the name, there probably should have been more pineapple pieces. Everything else was great about this dish and the portion was so big I took half of it home, which I hardly ever do. Unlike others, I don't think Cheesecake Factory is overpriced, depending on what you pick from the menu you can find some affordable options around 12 dollars. The burger bun for the turkey burger was burnt, badly on one side. A little bit dry meat and the mushrooms were missing. Mayo was good and the fries a lot better than the average fries.  For an angel hair pasta dish, asked for bacon to be removed and replaced with mushrooms instead. The server charged 1.50 dollars extra without informing us. Not cool. Mango Key Lime Cheesecake (with vanilla coconut macaron crust) had lot of flavour. Soo good! I counted the types of cheesecake on the menu and found a total of 33 different cheese cakes.

After getting our order, we asked an employee if we could sit at a table to eat it. Even though there was no one waiting in line to eat and there were empty tables available, we were denied access. The female who denied us a place to sit said that we could not eat at a table because we purchased the cheesecake ourselves rather than having a waiter/waitress bring it to us. If my husband and I had known we would have received such poor service, we definitely would not have stopped at this restaurant.

Saturday late lunch service was busy but we got a table quickly. Bread was good just like I remembered. Should have just stuck to bread and strawberry lemonade. Boy is that refreshing! We went with the avocado egg rolls on the recommendation of our waitress. They were ok. They are very salty and the sauce is very sweet. Kind of a rollercoaster ride for the tastebuds. Due to the preparation of them, the ends stay way too hot for a long time and the other side will be cold by that point. We had fun with the crispy rice noodles that garnished the plate though.  Entree was where I went horribly off track. I went with the chicken maderas based on internet reviews and seeing that it is the most popular chicken dish. This dish was very bland unless you had a bite with the cheese. The mushrooms were flavorless. The mashed potatoes were gummy. The chicken itself was nicely pounded and battered.

When first arriving, the hostesses asked my sister and I if we wanted to sit inside or outside. We were going to sit outside until we were told there would probably be a lot of flies on the patio. My sister and I were sat next to a huge window where there were still flies buzzing around. I saw one dead on the window seal next to me. The hostess explained that the windows have a treatment on them that kill insects.  We ordered a couple of appetizers including the Dynamite Shrimp the Factory Nachos. We sent the shrimp back because it was overcooked. By this time, the flies became absolutely unbearable so we asked the hostess to move us. She told us that more than likely there would still be flies wherever we sat, which was a huge problem in itself. She moved us near a booth closer to the inside of the restaurant and near the kitchen. There were still flies but not as many.

We told the server that our movie was at 7, and they even mentioned it later so I know they didn't forget. They just did a terrible job of returning to the table. Very pleasant, but not really attentive. The restaurant was busy, so maybe she had too many tables - but we were irked that she mentioned she knew we were on a timetable, but didn't drop off the check in anything like a timely fashion.  Asked another waiter, they dropped off the check - and then sprinted away before we could hand a credit card to pay! Host said they couldn't handle money, so they paged our original server.  Food is OK, not fantastic. I will say Cheesecake Factory does pretty well with their food given the diversity of the menu.
