296,Jessi D.,"Staten Island, NY",25,170,1079.0,4.0,2012-01-05,"The Cheesecake Factory in Melo Park Mall is a great restaurant. I recommend on busy nights as Thursdays-Saturdays can be a little harder to get a walk in table and may have waits from 30min-1hr 1/2, but it will be worth the wait.       The design is amazing, having large cathedral ceilings w/ excellent paint work. To the wood used on the bar, table and chairs. The restaurant is good for all romantic, family, or friends. Whether its a birthday, anniversary, or just a night out this restaurant has it.       The extended menu options is one reason I continue to come back to Cheescake Factory. I can recommend many dishes I have tried but can honestly say haven't tried something on menu that didn't come out perfect, juicy, or flavorful. The drink specials the Mojitos are a godsend. (Pomergranite is three thumbs up if I had an extra hand). Appetizer would say Avocado Egg rolls definitely need to try and Entree I can say you can never go wrong w/ chicken Romano. Dessert people you came to the Cheesecake Factory and they will not disappoint from traditional to over the top with over 23 styles for the pickings.       The service depends on the waitress/er there have been some over the top and some were subpar. This time around my waitress was perfect catering all request and constantly checking up on drinks. She never let the well go dry nor an extended wait for refill.       I can only give 4 stars cause I do believe they are starting to diminish on food quality  but not quantity.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=260,3.08,3.08,3.08,3.3760000000000003,3.0800000000000005

448,Sam B.,"Santa Clara, CA",194,818,939.0,4.0,2012-03-16,I have not been to cheesecake factory for many years because I hate waiting 30 minutes for tables and eating in a dark and noisy restaurant. My co-worker was craving for carb free cheesecake and he want me to try it. We drove 30 minutes from Newark and I was very hungry by the time we get there. I guess we were lucky and there is a table for 2 of us. I had the skinnylicious salmon and they are very good. The low carb cheesecake are not very sweet and very light.

Even if you're a picky eater, there is something for everyone in their huge, extensive menu.  I don't think I've ever tried something on the menu that I haven't liked. Portion size is big and prices are pretty reasonable. The Menlo location does get crowded, especially on Friday and Saturday nights, but they usually manage the wait efficiently. Service is quick and attentive. Our waitress constantly came over to our table to check up on us. Between 4 people, we shared the chicken samosas, sweet corn fritters, and the guacamole as appetizers. Everything was delicious! I had the Fettuccine with Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoes as my entrée, which needless to say, was really good. After we were done with our entrees, there was still a lot food left over.  How can you come to the Cheesecake Factory and not have cheesecake for dessert? There are about 26 different types of cheesecakes you can choose from!

409,Mango J.,"Manhattan, NY",866,230,164.0,1.0,2012-04-09,"Worst service ever,, the only high point was when the manager came over and I snitched,because our waiter jerk of a waiter flubbed the table adjacent to us' dining experience so the manager had already been  called on him. The manager accidently came over to ask us about dirty silverware , but our issue was the not being given appetizers we asked for and were left starving empty table - not even bread  for 45 minutes .. not the silverware (they gave the other table dirty utensils and then didnt come back) but obviously that waiter was serving so many tables insuffieciently and leaving us all hanging. I saw him zip past me several times to take birthday photos for some one, serve others  and people had such a hard time getting his attention. When he finally came he told me that he hoped the service didnt affect his tip and that it was the kitchen's fault. At that moment it became apparent to me he must have cheesecake for brains.. DONT ASK ME FOR A TIP.. BITCH!!! I understand its nice to tip and always do, but I thought it was extremely tacky to ask.It was also lame to throw his team/establishment under the bus.. he should have held it together in front of the customer  which was me. And gratuity is optional depending on service. and I always tip genrously anyway..But my waiter was such an iresponsible excuse making bull$@!^ artist and nah..  I wont go back..I dont like when the waiter forgets me then messed my food up, and then asks for a tip while im still eating..

We ate outside, mainly because it's too noisy inside.  Outside was great except there was a water drip from the gutter on the building (it hadn't rained in a while).  Since there were only two of us sitting at a table for 4, I was able to move.  However, if there were 4 of us dining, I would have asked for a different table.  There was food on the ground, so I guess they only clean at the end of the night.  It wasn't too bad, just noticeable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=340,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.12,3.3200000000000003

Usually I'm a fan of this chain but the service at this location wasn't the best. We had to ask for drinks, menus, bread, etc.  The food was great. We really enjoyed the Vietnamese Tacos as a starter. At first we thought they'd come in a Taco shell but instead it was a fluffy bun. Loads of crisp veg in there. Loved it. The Louisiana Chicken Pasta was my favorite Entree. Creamy sauce with a slight kick to it, crispy chicken, and mushrooms. Yum.

Fried cheese pieces (sorry I forgot what they were called) they tasted mostly like fancy mozzarella cheese sticks in triangle form. They were yummy, but then again, it's not hard to go wrong with that, right? Then I had the wasabi-crusted ahi tuna entree that the waiter recommended. I loved the wasabi crust, it had a mild taste of wasabi, and was fried crispy good. BUT THE FISH. :( What a let down. I really enjoy eating cooked fish in general, I enjoy salmon, tuna, tilapia, deep sea bass, flounder...and also eating raw fish, I enjoy most sashimis. BUT, this fish had a very strange flavor and texture. I don't know, maybe I just don't like ahi tuna...or they cooked it wrong? Hrm. Who knows? I just gotta try it again somewhere else.  The water with lemon was surprisingly bad. I know that most restaurants use tap water for their water as it is free and the ice usually hides the ""tap water"" taste, but nope. Not here! I get water at almost every restaurant I go to unless I am craving a specific drink. I would think that cheesecake factory, since it isn't a cheap restaurant, would at least make sure their water tastes okay. The onion ring was not good and the fries were mediocre. Now, onto dessert! MMMM! I got the kahlua cocoa cheesecake and my friend got the caramel pecan turtle cheesecake. DELICIOUS! I have absolutely no complaints about these cheesecakes. We also got nice large cappuccinos to go along with them. I appreciated the cappuccinos because they were frothy, in between warm/hot, and huge. I was very satisfied with the dessert.

421,Tom L.,"Glen Ridge, NJ",140,380,3.0,2.0,2012-10-13,"We were craving cheesecake, so decided to stop here on a Friday night. Extremely packed and a lot of people waiting, but the wait wasn't terrible (around 20 minutes). I was looking to order a couple drinks, but noticed there weren't any prices next to the drinks (one of my biggest restaurant peeves). I asked the waitress and the cheapest beer would be around 7 dollars, and the cocktails were even more. I decided to scrap that idea and just go for the food. The waitress very nice but was a bit absentminded (never brought us our bread until our food came, gave the wrong change for the bill), but she had been there for 12 hours and was obviously very tired so I don't blame her at all. I like how they give you both complimentary wheat and white bread. As for the actual food, my nachos were very cold, where the cheese was past the melty consistency and was just solid chunks. There was very little topping so most the chips just ended up uneaten. I tried the fried mac and cheese which was okay. The cheesecake choices, just like the menu choices, had plenty of variety and ours (chocolate tuxedo?) was a pretty solid choice. For two appetizers and a slice of cheesecake, it came out to $30 plus tip. Not the cheapest chain place and in my opinion, not worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=420,3.6,3.39,3.39,2.7600000000000007,3.474

The only one negative thing I can say about it is during the peak dinner hours over the weekend, it's very hard to get a table. The best thing to do is make a reservation beforehand or stalk the bar and wait for someone to leave. I did that the last time and it saved my boyfriend and I an hour wait for a table. So, plus 1 for being 21 and older! The ambiance: Very nice. Overall, place looks great and has a nice feel to it. It is rather dark in there. At first, I thought it was to hide how their food looks, but I've sat in the outside area a few times, and I must say, with or without light, the food looks and tastes great. The food: Delicious, just delicious. They have a HUGE variety of dishes to choose from, so I can't speak for the entire menu, but everything I've had their is magnificent. To start, their best dish is Chicken Bellagio. It's a tasty pasta dish with breaded chicken, arugula, prosciutto and angel hair pasta dipped in pesto sauce. I must have died recently because this dish tastes like heaven. Their Penne Vodka is also very good. Sauce just hits the spot. I've had their Country Fried Chicken Sandwich here and man is that sandwich big! It was hard to eat, but the chicken was fried perfectly and the chipotle sauce was just the right amount of kick. As for the dessert, the cheesecake is amazing. It's rare that I usually get it because I can't even finish my entire entree, but when I can fit it in, I give it an A+. The price: For the amount of portions they give you, it is totally worth it. As for their drinks, a bit on the pricey side. I didn't try any of their signature drinks. I stuck with a classic Blue Moon, but it costs me like $6. A Blue Moon is not worth that much, in my opinion.  The service: This depends on what time you're going here. When it's not as crowded, they come by more frequently to ask about your meal or refill your drink. However, when it gets really busy, you might see them once throughout your entire meal (not including them taking your drink/meal orders).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=240,3.28,3.33,3.33,3.472,3.31

Anyway, to start off they had very few vegetarian options besides the typical veggie burger which vegetarians get tired of real quick. I opted for the huevos rancheros and asked if there was any meat involved even though the menu didn't mention meat in the entree. The waiter did come back and informed me that the black bean were prepared with chicken broth. The black beans were a big part the entree but I still ordered it without the bean because there was nothing else on the menu that appeared to be appetizing without being overpriced. I was not paying $18 for a salad!  It may have been because I had no bean on my eggs but my meal was only OK. The salsa was pretty bland. Before we got our food the waiter did inform us that it taking a while because they overcooked my eggs...at this point I knew what I was going to get wasn't going to be great.  My friend ordered some salad off their low calorie menu and asked for salmon as the protein. She nothing to rave about her food. It was nice to look at though... The slices of cheesecake were huge so we decided to split a dulce de leche. That was pretty good and satisfying.  I have to say that our first waiter was a sweetheart!

Our waitress was great and gave us excellent service. She was patient and quick. The warm bushman (brown) bread is delicious with butter. We were able to get a second basket of them!  For our appetizer, the buffalo wings were dry and did not taste good. I would not order them again.  There was 7 of us and we ordered 4 entrees. This was more than enough for us! I really enjoyed the ranch chicken salad. It includes a pile of chicken, diced tomatoes, sweet corn, ranch salad, black beans and topped with fried onions. Bang bang chicken and shrimp was a hit. It is a thai influenced dish with your choice of white or brown rice in the center surrounded by coconut curry sauce and chicken and shrimp. The 2 misses were the fettucine pasta with sundried tomatoes and fish tacos. The pasta tasted very bland and needed more sauce. The corn tortilla was stale but the tempura fish was ok.  Even though we were all stuffed we had to try there cheesecakes! We ordered an original slice. It was velvety and smooth. Pretty pricey at 7 bucks a slice.

Let me preface this review by saying that this is my first time trying CF and that it was still a great dining experience - just nothing to rave about. The ambience here is really nice. My boyfriend and I were seated quickly, as were most parties of 2. The booths looked cozy but instead we ended up in a row of two-seat tables that were squished just a little too closely together. Even speaking at a low volume, there were definitely no private conversations to be had. I didn't expect for the menu to be so... long. There are a TON of choices here but I found myself still having a hard time stumbling upon something I really wanted. I was in the mood for pasta and was surprised that they only had spaghetti dishes - no lasagna, ravioli, etc. I ended up with a lemon chicken and angel hair pasta dish.  We started with a baked potato soup, which I highly recommend. Note: the portions here are fairly large and a ""cup"" of soup could actually be considered ""bowl"" sized elsewhere. My chicken and pasta dish was really tasty but not all too memorable... it was just your typical, average restaurant meal. Ended with the tiramisu cheesecake. As we all know, the dessert at CF is really the star, so no complaints here. I would come back just to eat try every cheesecake on the menu and nothing else.

For dessert we tried some of the Godiva Cheesecake; normally I'm not a fan of cheesecake, but the Godiva  cheesecake was the best cheesecake I've ever had; it had a triple layer of chocolate.  There were several vegetarian options and you could also get the non vegetarian options but without the meat; unlike other restaurants, the Cheesecake Factory is very accommodating. The service was decent, but that could have been because it was busy. The mood and environment of the restaurant was cozy and comfortable.

We had a large group of 15 and I was extremely impressed with our server.  Despite one really tall male waiter who help serve a couple of dishes (He seemed like he was not happy and was a little rude).  But our main server was super attentive and nice.   Had me a Georgia Peach -Skyy Vodka, Peach Liqueur and Peaches Swirled with Raspberries. Next time may ask to switch the Vodka to Grey Goose. Food: So they fill you up with unlimited Sour Dough and this Yummy Sweet Brown Bread with Oats on top.  MMmm The Brown Bread. My Favorite.  You can't help but to order appetizers, even though knowing that your entree would be too much for you to even finish and you know you would want to have um... Cheesecake? As for appetizers we ordered to share... *Fried Calamari - Perfectly Cooked, Crunchy and not too heavy on Flour. *Fried Mac & Cheese Balls - Crunchy, Creamy, Yummy *Stuffed Mushroom - Probably the best Stuffed Mushrooms I ever had. Perfect Blend of Cheeses and Herbs.  Didn't empower the mushrooms. Good Balance. *Tex Mex Egg Rolls - Fried Good -Sour Cream to Dip - Good - Chicken & Corn - Good *Avocado Egg Rolls - I didn't  eat, due to Allergies with Pine Nut or Sun Dried Tomatoes.  Now Entree... I finally ordered something else besides the Rib Eye...I tried the Bistro Shrimp Pasta and loved it!  Crispy Battered Shrimp, Fresh Mushrooms, Tomato and Arugula  Tossed with Spaghetti and a Basil-Garlic-Lemon Cream Sauce. But only was able to eat 1/3 obviously cause I was so full from eating apps and brown bread. Yummm. And did my best to save some room for Cheesecake of course.  My better half always orders the same pasta but he loves it... The Chicken Bellagio. Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad. The Fettuccine with Sun Dried Tomatoes and Chicken was just ok my brother said and wished he ordered his regular Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic. Luckily I sat next to my friend who ordered the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club.  That sandwich looked so yummy.  She said that the chicken was not dry and she was very happy with her selection.  I was very happy with her selection of Sweet Potato Fries too..lol Dessert...

The wait sometimes is frustrating even if you're here early there are already parties that showed up way ahead of you.   Food wise, I think the place needs to give some freebies because the apps are pricey almost as much as entrees.  The entrees also leaves out a lot of things such as bread, salads, or complimentary sides.  You gotta pay for all of that so in the end it cost a lot to eat at this place and you don't really get that much in terms of value. Steaks here are ok, maybe mouthwatering because you waited like over an hour just to sit down, order, and you're starving by the time the food gets here.

I have probably been to this Menlo park location about 20 times since it's opened. It's a pretty good spot to eat even though it's a chain and I am really not a fan of them. The atmosphere is actually pretty incredible. If there weren't a sign on the wall and people weren't dressed like they just came from shopping in the mall it could probably pass for a high end restaurant. Super high 30-35ft ceilings and great lighting make it very enjoyable to dine here. Appetizers/small plate:  Soy-glazed edamame is a super light fantastic tasting dish, it's sweet and smokey with just a little spice. Fried Mac and Cheese is always consistent and one of my favorites, if they made a normal dinner portion of this I would definitely order it. Tex Mex Eggsrolls, I have had them twice and although the one time they were excellent the second time the chicken was bland and tasted like it was boiled. Pasta carbonara, a very filling and heavy dish. It tastes delicious however it sits in your stomach like you filled it with cement. Chorizo and Avocado omelette, I have had this several times and it doesn't disappoint. It's made with a chicken chorizo. Chicken and Biscuits were delicious although super filling (as expected) the buttermilk biscuit in the middle was pretty fantastic.

I think thats my only problem with this place: despite having a huge menu ( where each item is over 1200 calories) and adding a ""skinny"" menu, their skinny alternaltive isnt necessarily 'healthy'. They dont have enough healthy options. Anyhow, my friend ordered their tex mex spring rolls and they were good- slightly spicy.. served with an avocado sauce and salsa.

Most of the time i need the server they always not around and there was a time that i asked 3 differrent servers to get me menu back again not of them came back to bring it. What i got from them is the answer give me one second, and the reason why is beacause the table i have is not their stations thats why they don't care. After a while of waiting the waiter finally show up and guest what i couldnt event talk to him because his smell pure cigarette, we desided to get the check and leave.

211,Enza F.,"Staten Island, NY",15,21,15.0,4.0,2015-08-02,"My first visit to the Cheesecake Factory. I had done my homework and had a pretty good ideas what I wanted to order.  With that said, lets get down to the nitty-gritty. One less star was for the long wait between our appetizer and dinner order. In addition some missing ingredients and it was FREEZZZing where we were seating. 4stars is generous coming from me.  We ordered fried calamari and the sweet corn tamale cakes. Both dish phenomenal.  The calamari was so tender. Truly amazing! Then I ordered a Cobb salad which is supposed to have the crunch of bacon bits and hard boiled egg. Those two ingredients were surely missing. I could not see, taste or smell it! lol Other than that the salad was good but I would not call it COBB salad. The kids had burgers and they were quite happy so were we, that they were happy. Finally, the kids shared a chocolate moose slice which when I tasted it was also delicious.  What would be the point to go to the Cheesecake Factory without getting a slice of cheesecake which we took home to have it with our espresso on Sunday morning. I have to say it sure was good to have it this morning instead of last night! I enjoyed it immensely with my espresso.  I'm impressed with this high end fast food restaurant! The prices are fair for the amount of food they give you. I don't think the online menu prices are the same. They were slightly higher at the place. I will definitely be going back to try out the Thai lettuce wrap!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=140,3.32,3.45,3.46,2.8960000000000004,3.398

254,Hunny M.,"Staten Island, NY",1,61,7.0,2.0,2015-08-11,"I've been to this place several times & the food is your typical chain restaurant fare, all salty & greasy as hell. Very limited options for anyone trying to eat even moderately healthy.  The service is usually not too bad, but I've always gone before the big dinner crowd hits.   I recently went on a Monday at about 430 pm, with a party of 3.  At that day & time, the place was less than 1/3 full. I asked the host for a booth & he seated us at a table. When I pointed out the many available booths, he replied that those are for larger parties before walking away. I got up, went back to the front and asked a different person to be seated at a booth. For her, it didn't seem to be an issue, aside from a slight eye roll. Once seated however, the service was fine.  As for the cheese cakes--this restaurants claim to fame--they are ok. Just ok, you ask? They have many different varieties, all very appealing to the eye, but my experience has shown that the fancier ones are very disappointing. One example is the key lime cheesecake. It combines two of my favorite desserts, so I was really excited to try it, but it was a huge let down--sickeningly sweet & not much other real flavor. Ditto for the Oreo cookie variety.  If you do get cheesecake, I think the simpler the better.  This place also gets super loud, even during times when it's not packed. Not sure if it's the acoustics, (high ceilings & marble tile through out) but if noisy places are an issue, be mindful.  For your typical chain restaurant grub, I find the prices pretty high. I don't mind paying for high quality food, but the food is on par with a TGIFs or a Chilis. Dinner for 3, no alcohol & a shared appetizer ran us $90.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=240,3.32,3.42,3.464,2.6000000000000005,3.3800000000000003

The food is always the same here. Their quality is constant and they have such a large menu, so there is a lot to choose from, and there is something for everyone. We had the nachos as an appetizer which was delicious, and I other the smokehouse burger which was also good. The cheesecake here is pretty classic. There is possibly any cheesecake you can think of having.

I guess you can say we misunderstood the menu. Any who, we were both disappointed with our meals since we were expecting something else. BUT, thanks to Josh, I'm assuming the manger, came to the rescue! He explained to us what the typical order comes with and even mentioned he made the same assumption with the meal description, and understood our concern. He quickly grabbed both of our dinners to the back and flew back to us in 3 min with our orders fixed! He was super kind about it, and didn't waste time to argue, but rather explain so we'd understand for our next visit. I always have an amazing experience at this location!

160,Christopher K.,"East Brunswick, NJ",878,671,798.0,2.0,2015-08-14,"I cannot comprehend all the love for the Cheesecake Factory, especially this particular outpost, which fails in almost all categories relative to its peers in other cities. In general, the Cheesecake Factory is a glorified diner, only more fancy-looking and expensive. You can definitely get a decent meal here, but the food is hardly anything to jump up and down about. I generally only come here because its convenient when we get the kids together with their grandparents. I can't think of any diners that can fit 8-10 people in a single booth. Maybe it's because I don't like cheesecake. Maybe it's because I don't care for the decor. Maybe's it's because, despite having a 20-page menu, I can never find anything to order that sounds appealing. I can tell you what it was on my trip here the other day: this location's complete inability to deliver on what I would normally say would be a 3-star experience at best. First off, the place feels worn down relative to other locations. Secondly, all of the food we ordered was served cold. Thirdly, the food we ordered was just not good. This was probably the first time anyone in our party ever ordered a flatbread pizza here, but the margarita version was terrible. Served cold and on a cracker-like bread, the fontina cheese blend was broiled until it was crunchy, and the fresh mozzarella was sprinkled on cold. And ironically we were told that's how the recipe calls for it. Awful. Skip it. I had the spicy chicken soft tacos, which were neither spicy nor were they served even close to warm. And even the sauces and accouterments couldn't save this dreadfully dry and bland dish. The pickled vegetable salad on the side was so bad it was offensive. I could go on, but I will spare you the grief. I try to avoid one and two star reviews as much as possible, but this is just one of those restaurants I've been forced to endure for years and I still don't get why everyone loves it so much. Your best bet here is to order something really unhealthy that comes out of the fryer. In my experiences, this has always been the highlight of their incredibly mediocre offering. Or better yet, skip this chain restaurant and go eat some real food somewhere!

344,Alexis C.,"Hazlet, NJ",150,8,1.0,2.0,2015-08-30,"Very disappointed with my service tonight. I have dined at the West Palm Beach Cheesecake Factory  location many times and had wonderful experiences there. My boyfriend had never dined here so tonight I decided to take him out for my treat. Sundays is our day together so we always go out to eat and see a movie. I am a server myself so I know better than most how difficult this job can be. Our server tonight was Juan. He did greet us promptly but when I asked if they could serve a Miami Vice cocktail, which is just a combination of two drinks already on their menu, he said they couldn't do it even after I explained to him what the drink was. I ordered a Pina Colada instead and my boyfriend ordered one of  their margaritas. Instead of bringing our drinks together,  he brought my drink out and then my boyfriend's drink five minutes later. He took our order when we were ready. I then informed him that we only had one setting of silverware for the two of us. He said he would be right back with it. Our app came out but we still only had one set of silverware so we had to ask our food runner to bring us a set, which he did right away. We finished our app and recieved our dinner. All the food came out fantastic. While eating my boyfriend finished his first drink and put it on the end of the table. Juan passed by his empty glass three or four times and proceeded to sit with another of his tables directly behind us. He sat with this table and talked with them about how boring his job was and how he didn't want to go inside because "" then they will make me work."" This table then asked if he had any other tables to which he responded ""no, i don't really have any other tables."" All this while my boyfriend sat there with an empty drink and would probably not even have gotten silverware if it had not been for Juan's coworker. Finally my boyfriend called him over to ask if he was still our server and if he could have another drink. Without any apology my boyfriend recieved his second drink fifteen  minutes after finishing his first. The rest of our dining experience felt rushed; Juan came over a few times to ask if we wanted our food wrapped even though our drinks and plates were still 3/4 full. In the end, our bill was $108, I left an $18 tip for our horrible service and called it a night. Should have gone to McDonald's instead. Very disappointed tonight, especially from a fellow server's standpoint. I try to give people the benefit of the doubt which is why I still left a decent tip but in my opinion I would have been better off getting take out. Management needs to make sure their servers are happy and want to be there. I found out this server has been there for about a year and that blows me away. If you are not happy and don't want to do the work that your job entails,find another job more well-suited for you, Juan.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=340,3.56,3.39,3.452,2.2800000000000002,3.458

I watched one employee while on line waiting for my 'to go' order for a good 10 minutes- not once did she wash her hands or put on gloves. My conscience would not let me leave that place without notifying the manager. What a disgrace this manager, Andrea, was. This was not your typical ""my food came out cold"" complaint, this was a ""you're violating code"" complaint. No apologetic tone from her, just that she told the worker to put gloves on. I asked for the district manager's number given her unenthusiastic response. Called the DM, Raymond Day, 3 days ago and still waiting for a response. Guess there are defects all around with this company's management. Because of the laziness of some of their workers or perhaps poor management in not making sure their employees follow code, they are setting themselves up for a big liability. Warning to Cheesecake Factory: Not sure if you read the news, but kids DIE from anaphylactic reactions EVERY DAY, mainly from throat swelling from nut allergies!!!!

108,Alexander H.,"Scranton, PA",1075,586,6680.0,4.0,2015-11-04,"It's time for a revamp, and my rating will stay the same.  We came on a Saturday night, which was Halloween. Initially, we had plans for dinner somewhere else with a reservation. However, after hearing that there was a 10-15 minute for tables that night only, we decided to cancel our reservation somewhere else and dine here instead. We did that because this place never takes reservations, and waiting times can reach 60 minutes or more on a Saturday night, just like my previous experience back in 2013. After a 13 minute wait, we were seated at a booth. 5 minutes later, our friendly server approached us to take our drink orders. We all ordered water, but I also ordered a ""Flying Gorilla"" (go ahead - laugh) for my specialty drink craving. After a 10 minute wait, our drinks came, along with a bread basket filled with miniature loaves of Honey Wheat Bread and one mini baguette loaf. The ""Flying Gorilla"" was a chocolate-banana milkshake SPIKED with a REASONABLE AMOUNT of Dark Chocolate and Banana Liqueur. I was much more impressed with this shake than the one at Bill's Bar and Burger of Harrah's AC. The shake wasn't too thick, the sweet flavor was great, and the liquor sensation was STRONG. But if that wasn't enough, a mound of whipped cream was placed on top along with some chocolate chips. Be sure to scoop out and eat the chocolate chips when you're finished with this tasty treat. Hey Bill, THIS is a PROPERLY SPIKED milkshake, unlike yours. Highly recommended. The Honey Wheat Bread was topped off with oat pieces. The honey flavor was sweet, and it tasted hot and fresh. The baguette also tasted hot and fresh too. Butter was included with the basket, which enhanced the taste of the breads. Five minutes after we finished our bread, our entrees came out. I had the Chicken Madeira. This was a sauteed chicken breast that was topped with melted Mozzarella cheese and covered with a mushroom Madeira sauce. Also placed on top was asparagus. Mashed Potatoes was served on the side. I could see and taste why this was one of their popular entrees. The sauteed chicken itself tasted great with the seasoning, and the melted cheese and mushroom Madeira sauce only enhanced the flavor. The mashed potatoes had a unique flavor, and it was good. The asparagus tasted fresh. An older woman approached our table and asked me what I ordered. After I told her what it was, she thanked me and said that looks good. I said that it was worth trying.  My dad ordered the Spicy Orange Chicken entree. This consisted of fried pieces of chicken breasts smothered in a sweet and spicy orange sauce. This was served with a side mound of white rice with seasoning on top, and vegetables (snow peas, carrots, etc.) mixed with the sauce. He liked his entree. I tasted the chicken, and it was quite good! My mom had the Hibachi Steak entree. This steak came with Shiitake Mushrooms, onions,  Wasabi flavored mashed Potatoes, and fried asparagus. She ordered her steak cooked medium. She enjoyed her entree. I had a taste too, and the sauce that was utilized for the steak was tasty.  Of course, this outing wouldn't be complete without, well, cheesecake! We ordered two slices to share. The first one was the seasonal Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore. This consisted of Hershey's Creamy CHOCOLATE Cheesecake (without the chocolate cake layers) topped off with a chocolate GANACHE.  On top of that slice was a melted toasted marshmallow, a graham cracker, and whipped cream. An additional mound of whipped cream was added on the side. The flavor was really rich! I recommend this flavor to chocolate lovers.    The other slice was the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake. This cheesecake contained white chocolate and macadamia nut chunks, and on top of that was a swirl of caramel syrup and more macadamia nuts. Whipped cream was also placed on top of the slice and on the side. This was good, but a little too sweet.  As what another C.J. Yelper posted in her classic review, eating this by yourself in one sitting can be overwhelming, since the slices are quite big. It's best to share the slices with your friends or family members. If you're alone, just take the unfinished portion home for early future consumption. I keep the rating the same due to the service being on the sluggish side. Maybe you can't rush perfection on spiked milkshakes and entrees, but a 12 minute wait on the cheesecake slices was puzzling.  Overall, this was a very good dining experience. Our server was pleasantly kind throughout the evening. We may consider eating here sometime later on in the future.

Then the manager, Andrea, came over and said that we were not allowed to sit at the booth.  She said that we needed to go back to the table that they attempted to sit us at originally.  She then accused us of just seating ourselves and said that we were not allowed to just seat ourselves.  Keep in mind we asked her staff and they said it was okay. Having a manager come over and attempt to undo something that her staff had done to rectify a serious mistake on their part is unbelievable.   Probably the rudest thing I have ever seen.  She then acted like a dictator and said that her staff is not allowed to make these types of decisions and that we needed to come to see her.  I said that we informed her staff that we had an issue and that they said it was okay for us to sit in the booth. If their staff are unable to make those decisions they should be told that they cannot do anything like this without checking with the manager.  We would have been happy to wait for the manager to come and rectify the situation if their staff had informed us.  That is not what happened though. The problems continue when the manager returns and starts arguing with us saying that we didn't accept her previous offer to move back to the original table.  She then offers to move us to a different booth and saying that if we wanted a booth that we should have just asked and just not taken the booth.   This person obviously doesn't get it!  We didn't care about the booth.  We just wanted to be seated and not be standing at a table in the middle of the restaurant for ten minutes.  She then continues to accuse us of taking the seat and arguing with us over details rather than trying to rectify the problem. We asked for her business card and we informed her that we would be writing to the CEO.  She said fine!  Of course she does not return with her business card.  She returned with her general manager's card, Raymond Day, and then said that he stands by her and that it does not matter what I say.  Really!

I've waited so long, I can't help but feel how amazing this tastes and how thankful I am to have it.  Sweet and Low please?  Thank you to our server to stop when I asked him to as he was busy running from table to table.  ""Appetizers will be out shortly"" code for - once we get them in the over / fryer that is.  Clearly 40 minutes after we place the appetizer order you would think they would be out shortly.   Thank you for the kitchen staff for promptly giving us our meals and for our server to not check on us once they were brought out.      Not wanting to choke on my dried rice, I am still holding tight to my ice tea, as I know it would not be refilled any time soon.  I could have died and the server would not have noticed. Asking for to go containers required a 20 minute wait. Are they so eco-friendly that they physically make them as needed in a separate rood in the back? Containers are they as sacred as the eternal spirit of a enlighten cow in a foreign eastern country.   Let us pray they come out quickly.  Planned Cheesecake.... in which you eat 1/2 in the restaurant and 1/2 a later time requires a sacred to-go container.  In which we were told no we can serve the cheese cake you plan to eat only half here in to go containers.  Okay make them to go and we will just eat them here anyways and save the 20 minute wait for the containers.   The Land Before Time - in which would-be orphaned dinosaurs seek food and nutriment so they can reunite with their families, only to be told by the guardians ""I'll be right back"". No Cheesecake Factory I don't think I will be right back.  Your mediocre food presented in a dimly lit room of dust covered dated opulence doesn't mask the greed of corporate.

If an establishment goes as far as to boast about its allergy accommodations, one would assume this would be a monitored issue. The staff is clearly uneducated in gluten allergies because I have been there 3 times in the last 6 months and have had an allergic reaction each time. It is the responsibility of the manages and corporate to educate the serves. Allergies are a serious issue, and as someone who suffers from food allergies, this negligence just won't do.

129,Melissa D.,"West Orange, NJ",1,10,,2.0,2016-03-27,"My wife and I were very excited to discover that Cheesecake Factory had a wide array of Gluten Free options since she has Celiacs. However, this location in Edison has clearly not educated their staff on the allergy or maybe the seriousness behind it. My wife is not gluten sensitive- it is not a choice- she has celiacs which means she can not have it.  On three separate occasions she has gotten sick. The first time she ordered the gluten free Ceasar salad, we found out later the Ceasar dressing was NOT gluten free. The second time they brought her salad out with croutons, when we pointed this out they removed the croutons but clearly did not redo the salad. Tonight she ordered a salad again, with a different dressing that was supposed to be gluten free. After dinner we had purchased tickets to a movie where she begin to have an allergic reaction which left her in the movie theatre bathroom throwing up the majority of the movie. It is now 6 hours later and she is still throwing up and breaking out into hives.  So we wasted money on dinner and a movie and now have to monitor her in case she needs to go to the emergency room. When will this be addressed to the staff? Most restaurants who offer gluten free dining do not even allow a waiter or waitress to touch the dish, a chef hand delivers it. This is not a diet fad, this is an allergy that can cause stomach cancer. This is an allergy that can lead to reactions such as hives and difficulty breathing, which is what she is experiencing right now. People with this illness should not have to worry about this every time they try to have a nice night out at a restaurant that claims to understand and offer Gluten Free dining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=120,2.32,3.03,3.332,2.8240000000000003,2.7459999999999996

181,Steve L.,"Staten Island, NY",2,25,68.0,5.0,2016-04-15,"Nothing compares to this gourmet chain. Their food, chain wide, is always consistent no matter if you order it in New Jersey or California. I've traveled all over & know what to expect no matter which location I'm in. I can honestly say I love almost everything on their menu. The portion size is alway huge. You get a lot for your money. I've found that if you'd actually like to order dessert, the best thing to do is share an appetizer & a main course with someone. My family & I love the fact that this chain constantly changes out items on their menu to keep the choices fresh, and also to improve already successful dishes, where as other chains stagnate with the same boring menu for years. For starters, we've narrowed down the appetizers to the Factory Chopped Salad, Avocado Eggrolls, & lastly the Buffalo Chicken Strips. We order them without the spicy Buffalo sauce, dry, but love the extra chunky Blue Cheese dressing & the celery with it. For the main courses we always love having the Crispy Chicken Costoletta. It's wonderfully done with a light lemon zest that really sparkles. It's served up with their mashed potatoes & asparagus. A second dish that's a must for those pasta lovers is the Tomato Basil Pasta , it's grilled chicken, fresh mozzarella, a touch of garlic and penne pasta that's cooked to perfection, al dente, WOW !!! If you've left some room, any dessert is incredible. You can't go wrong with any choice. In my family (4) of us, we all have our own favorites making it a very hard decision to just pick 1 or 2. Our favorites are: Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake, my wife's favorite. Oreo Cheesecake & the Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake are my children's favorites. Lastly my favorite is the Godiva Chocolate Brownie Sundae.

I was looking to host a dinner for about 35 people last week for my 2 children's birthday party, so I went through the proper channels to see if I can make a reservation. They agreed since it's such a large crowd that we can have reservations at 7pm, which worked perfectly for us. They asked us to send in our orders in advance so the kitchen doesn't get backed up the day off, which we did. We have all these communications via email.  Here is where things get messy: I get a call a day before the party and turns out someone messed something up and they couldn't host us anymore. I argued that I have already invited 30 people for a party less then 24 hours later and I can't change everything. They told me the manager would call me. You would think it wouldn't get bad but it gets worse. Joe, the manager, called me back later that day. Talk about unprofessional. He says there's nothing they can do, it wasn't ""his"" fault. I asked if there was anything, maybe even split tables to accommodate. His answer: I can give you a table at 4pm. I asked him who has dinner at 4, and he had the audacity to tell me he has ""dinner at 4pm all the time"". The whole conversation was rude and downright disrespectful.  Long story short, I had to cancel the party. I tried to find other places but with the limited time I just couldn't do it. On behalf of my 2 kids, who just turned 3, thanks for nothing.

127,John F.,"Perth Amboy, NJ",0,6,,3.0,2016-08-31,"I have found the food and service at this location to be very good. It is a chain, so of course I don't need to go into details about specific dishes. They are great with substitutions, which is important for me as I'm on a low carb diet, so it's always nice to be able to swap pasta or potatoes for veggies. My only issue with this location is the front desk when there is a wait, which is usually the case on weekends. On my last visit, after asking for a booth for two, we waited and were eventually shown to a table. I said I would be willing to wait for the booth I requested, as we don't like having people taking flash pictures or have screaming babies right on top of us, and asked to be put back on the list and get another ""beeper"", but I was told that wasn't necessary. Then we waited a half hour, and apparently they had completely forgotten about us. My diabetic friend was starting to have a low blood sugar episode, and they forgot about us again. What was supposed to be a pleasant last-minute dinner out turned into an ordeal with a friend feeling ill and in tears. The visit before that had a long wait, and an apparently malfunctioning beeper, so we were never aware that our table was ready. There is a person calling names that are ready to be seated, but at such a soft volume, you can barely hear him even if he's right next to you, let alone among the crowd.

First of all my fiancé and I ordered a kale salad as an appetizer to share.  It was served to us with zero dressing which caused us to basically choke on the dry kale leaves. But we were hungry from being outdoors apple and pumpkin picking all day so we just attempted to eat it. My fiancé ordered Everlyns favorite pasta without mushrooms, as he despises them as his entree and I ordered the Factory Burger on wheat loaf cooked medium rare. First of all his pasta did indeed have mushrooms in it. But because we have both worked in the food service industry and did not want to make a big deal out of mushrooms we figured we could just pick them out. We are both very compassionate nice people. When my burger arrived , before it even hit the table, I could tell it was severely undercooked. But with further inspection my burger was RAW. I even put my finger into the meat and it was cold and bloody, basically still mooing. I immediately called our lovely waitress over and she took it away and apologized profusely. I told her it isn't her fault but can she please have them remake this because I was completely turned off. She came back several times still apologizing and even said that her kitchen manager exclaimed ""omg no that's not right"" when he saw the severity of how my burger was undercooked. To make matters even worse my side salad that came with my burger was rotten and slimy and contained what looks like a worm or some sort of creature with further inspection of the photo I took of it. We did receive 2 slices of cheesecake on the house but I feel like the Cheesecake Factory company needs to know that something is a wry at this Menlo Park location. A few years back there was a cockroach in my food at this same location. But I believe in second chances ..and I think this past experience was my last visit to Cheesecake Factory.

My friend had received a gift card (again) for Christmas so hey why not enjoy a free meal :) We went to see a movie and came here after. The wait on a Sunday at 6pm was 40 minutes. We sucked it up because of the gift card and waited. I've been to this location before and there is always a similar wait. There really isn't a great place to wait. There are a few benches but not enough for all of the people waiting.   When our table was ready we were seated by the bar. For some reason the floor was really slippery and greasy. I ordered a coke and was told the bar was out of coke. They had a few new dishes on a special menu so me & my friend decided to order the salad. Our waiter said we couldn't change anything about the salad off the menu. No removing anything!  Not even dressing. So instead we just ordered off their regular, 345 page menu.  We both chose the avocado salad and added chicken. Instead we got a salad with guacamole on top. Not quite the same but nice try. This is the third time we've ordered a dish with avocado and either received little or no avocado. I'm not sure why they don't just stop trying to sell dishes with avocados.  On top of everything from the start of our wait until we finished dinner was almost 3 hours!  For a 40 min wait. Two people ordering salad and 1 dessert. You do the math with all the waiting.  The only reason we keep coming back is because my friend keeps getting gift cards. This place is probably one of my least favorite chains.

The waiter and manager both came up to me to profusely apologize and told me they looked into the issue (apparently they went back into the kitchen to see if the water used to boil the pasta was too salty or if some other mistake had been made). They suggested another dish for me which turned out great. I couldn't have been more pleased with their customer service.  And you can never go wrong with their Cheesecake for dessert.  Very ample parking as this restaurant is connected to the mall. That's right...I said it's next to the mall.

I order my usual meal, the bang, bang chicken and shrimp. What did I get? Over done chicken and blackened shrimp. Portion, half what is usually served. When I tried to eat it, I couldn't. The shrimp was so spicy it was inedible and nothing like its ever been. I told server what was wrong and she said she would take it back. So far no complaints.  Where it went wrong was when both the server and the manager kept trying to tell me that the food was fine and I was wrong. When I told them it's what I always get and it was not made correctly they kept insisting the problem was with me.  Finally resolved by making me a new plate which I opted to take home since by this time everyone in my party was done eating.  So what did I get? Did I get a full portion? NO I got what looks like leftovers.  The only reason I'm not giving them one star is because they at least chose to pull dish from the bill, which by the way was $250.

Our waitress came almost immediately so we didn't have to wait too long. The only thing that took a decent amount of time was actually getting our beers/riesling. Bread was hot and fresh!  My friend ordered the Chicken Riesling and I ordered the Skinnylicious Lemon Garlic Shrimp which is supposedly 590 calories or less. Both dishes were paired with angel hair pasta. It tasted delicious. We both ate our food slowly so that we could savor it. Not sure if it's really 590 calories or less or not but it was still really good. And I was full off of half a serving to save the other half for lunch next the next day. Overall good experience coming here at the Cheesecake Factory on a Tuesday night around 8:30 PM. It's nice that they list all of the calories for the menu items which makes it hard to decide which cheesecake is the best one to get since they are all 1000 calories and upwards lol! So i decided to get the banana cream cheesecake to go and spread out eating it over one week. Sooooo good and so happy I got that one! There is a cheesecake which is made with splenda and it is only 600 calories. But I think the funniest thing on the menu at Cheesecake is that you can get a bowl of strawberries for 250 calories for like $7.

The staff here don't seem to know how to keep things clean! Okay so first of all, they make you wait 30-45 mins to get seated. I don't really mind that because I am very patient and I know they are packed especially on the weekends. Anyway, when they finally got us to the table, the table and seats were still wet. So we told the receptionist that the table was still wet and she called the cleaning staff to wipe it dry. The unhappy cleaning staff took a dirty cloth (with stains and all) hanging from his apron and wiped the table, then the seats THEN THE TABLE AGAIN. The table was still wet. Obviously he was rushing with all the other tables he has to clean. Then he took the utensils out from his apron pocket and started laying it down on the WET table which he wiped by his DIRTY towel. Then he left. So we gathered all the utensils (that time we noticed some chunks of food on the utensils too which was gross), put them on one side and when the server came, we asked for new utensils. So she got us new ones and I told her not to lay it on the table and get us napkins. She did what we asked but the second set of utensils were still dirty. It also had some pieces of food in between the forks. So we  returned only those that looked dirty and asked for replacements. I wanted to leave but my family was already hungry and it was late so I said okay give them another chance but one more mistake from them and we will walk out. Good thing our server was too good (too good for that place) that she made the rest of our time there okay. The whole time I was paranoid about how my food was prepared and if it was clean. But upon visual inspection, it seemed okay. We didn't get tummy aches after so I guess food was clean or we just have tough guts. I just hope they improve the way they sanitize their tables and utensils and at least wrap their utensils in napkins before they put it on the tables. It's so disgusting.

This location is busy but huge so seating is rarely a problem. This time around, I waited 2 minutes for a Sunday night dinner for two. Our waitress was extremely pleasant and attentive despite the many tables she was waiting on and the food was as good as I expected it to be.

Our waitress took longer than usual to come and introduce herself and that was a bit annoying because it was already late. When she finally decided it was time to show her face she only asked us what we would like to drink (and you could imagine she took her time with that too) Also, the famous Cheesecake Factory bread wasn't delivered until we asked.  Our food just as you could imagine took all night just to get to us. Very mediocre to say the least. I ordered loaded tots and they were not at all how I imagined them.

I'm a huge fan of their pastas! I guess this place also has sentimental value because of my birthday but its a great place. Downside is that it get crazy packed with parking. Terribly. It's shared with the mall and people love this place so never come here on a Friday or a Saturday. Thankfully my birthday has fallen generally on a Tuesday or Wednesday.  Also the cheesecake is BOMB!

I was greeted by a friendly host and was told it would only be 10-15 minutes before I would be seated outside on the patio. I joked around with her about free cheesecake considering it was National Cheesecake day. She told me it was half off slices for dine in (no limit) and even joked around about how people should just get a table but are ordering takeout slices and are allowed one slice at 50% off. My table was finally ready after only ten minutes and I was lead to the patio by another host.  After a couple of minutes at the table I was introduced to my waitress and she asked me if I knew what I wanted to drink and if I wanted to order an app. I ordered a water to start off and needed a few minutes to look at the menu. A couple minutes passed and my server was back to take my order; I decided on a side house salad tossed in vinaigrette and the Tuscan Chicken off their Skinnylicious Menu sub brown rice instead of the farro.  She advised me that the serving of rice was going to be small and suggested she bring me an additional side of rice but I was ok with the size of the serving.  About five minutes after she took my order, my salad and fresh bread came out but as I was ready to dig in, I had no silverware or napkin. I eventually flagged down another server, since mine was no where in sight, that rushed to get me utensils and a napkin and he apologized even though it wasn't his fault. So I start eating my salad and not half way through it, my meal comes out. I feel like the timing between the courses were input correctly hence the overlapping. I like to finish the app and then the dinner come out after I've finished.  I'm enjoying dinner but wish I had some more water. 3/4s of the way into my dinner my server comes back and tells me she is going to refill my water and then asks me if I am enjoying the entrée.  At the point I didn't feel like a welcomed guest. To make things even worse as far as the service went, I finished my meal and, no exaggeration, waited 15 minutes before she appeared to ask me if I wanted dessert and/or coffee but she didn't even stop at the table. She acknowledged me in passing as she was heading to another table.  I declined and just asked for the check. Another 10 minutes go by and another server brings the check and at this point I was completely unsatisfied with the service.  I can't believe it took 30 mins after my meal just to settle the bill.

It's sort of a hit or miss. Some meals are great and others not so much.  The good thing about this place, is they have everything under the sun. You want it, they have it. All tucked away in their somewhat of a 20 page menu.  Although I give it three stars I do still dine here from time to time. Some tips: -Try and look over the menu online so you have a better idea of what you'd like. Looking at the menu for the first time seated is overwhelming  -if you're thinking of going Friday to Sunday at night be prepared to wait about an hour. Reccomendations: Garlic cheesy bread to start! It is one of the best I've had it comes out as a loaf of Italian bread and you get to pull it apart and watch the cheese and garlic spill out The Cajun chicken and French fries. It's basically chicken fingers and French fries but it comes with so much. It can be shared between two people for sure and it only cost about $14 The chicken fetucce is very good and tasty.  The burgers are always good I do not recommend: The cheesecake, I know I know that's the whole point. It's not my favorite cheesecake to be honest, it's dense and heavy and doesn't seem to taste fresh. I've given it a few chances but doesn't do it for me. This is for the plain cheesecake I have yet to try other flavors.

I had lunch here last weekend and since the weather was so beautiful out, I requested for outdoor seating. You could tell everyone had the same idea because the place was getting more and more crowded after we sat down. Our waitress (forgot her name) was super nice - she took great care of us. Despite the abrupt change of pace, she still managed to accommodate us. I ordered the Thai Coconut-Lime Chicken while my brother ordered the Macaroni & Cheese Burger. First off, let me say that after reading the description for my dish, I didn't really think anything of it. I just knew I was hungry and needed food ASAP. Luckily for me, the food didn't take long to arrive. Looking at my dish, (let's be honest) I'd say it wasn't really an eye-catching type of dish. Presentation could have used some work, but after my first bite, I was taken back!! The flavors on this plate was phenomenal. The portion size was huge! This could have easily been a dish for two people but no complaints here. I took my leftovers home, only to have it for lunch the next day. My brother definitely enjoyed his food as well, he basically inhaled his food to say the least. I wish all my prior visits to Cheesecake Factory were as pleasant as this one.

However , we were seated right away on a Friday afternoon. My friend and I were seated at a small two seater table that was almost on top of the next table. Felt too close for comfort as I thought the next table could hear our whole conversation. So I asked to be switched to a booth. The waitress then seemed bothered by that. We were off to a good start - we got our drinks promptly. However, the waitress seemed frantic with too many tables to attend too. We had to ask for bread, water, and silverware. She was not attentive at all. Maybe all of three times- to get our drink order, to get our lunch order, and to deliver the food. It seems they may be lacking in staff or could use a few bus boys.  To start we ordered the sweet corn tamale cakes which is topped with sour cream, salsa, avocado and salsa verde. I really wish we didn't order this because I felt like absolute death the whole day after. It's so filling and rich I wouldn't order it again.  From the skinnylicious menu I ordered the ahi tartare which is raw tuna with avocado and a soy-ginger sesame sauce. This was good but it could have used a few more of the chips it came out with. There were only 4. My friend also ordered from the skinny menu she got the chicken lettuce wrap tacos in the Asian style. She loved those.  I used to love Cheesecake Factory but it seems like it's going downhill. The staff is inattentive and seems as though your bothering them. Also the food is lacking in all aspects.

As someone who has worked To-Go at a restaurant before, I understand it's overwhelming but you have to be hospitable to your guests and at least let them know that you will serve them shortly.  Once she finally greeted me she took my order of a slice of Oreo cheesecake and then I waited 15 minutes for it. During the last 5 minutes I saw my slice in the To-GO box on the counter with a receipt on it, just waiting to be put into a bag. I finally got my slice of cheesecake and walked out.

We stayed because we were initially in shock to be honest, he was very  shaken up  (it was huge mistake...... to stay after that.....) the service went down hill from there. If you can believe anything more below almost choking on a piece of plastic. We then waited 30 minutes or more..... for the waiter to pick up the money for our bill and a piece of cake. Worst experience of my life, felt totally disrespected and mistreated as a customer. I will never go back into that place again and will be calling the corporate office and the NJ board of health  first thing in the morning. Plastic in food could kill someone. Imagine if it was a child who ate that? who wouldn't have the sense to know it didn't feel right and swallowed it? My boyfriend almost  swallowed it, let alone a child..... and I saw plenty of children  in there.  Thankfully my boyfriend  started coughing so it delayed him swallowing it  and he realized there was something that didn't feel right before he swallowed it and choked.

It wasn't busy at all when I was here yet it took like 10 mins for someone to ask us for our drinks and another 10 to get the drinks and then another 10 to place our order. Utensils were dirty/water marked on top and the bases were handled by someone who's fingers were definitely greasy. Our waitress was an older lady and she was rude. Every single time we needed something she just ran past us while we asked and she gave us a ""yup!"" Or ""okay!"" I was honestly giving three reviews but I dropped a star just for her. We finally needed the check and while we just said ""excuse me?"" And she was like ""give me a minute"" while she brushed us off. A young group of college students yeah sure but we are paying customers. We are polite and respectful and actually tip a decent amount wherever we go but this lady brushed us and tossed us to the side and it was obvious. All brushing off and you'd think that she would be running around being busy but nope she didn't even bring our food out to us. The two gentlemen who did were kinder and more accommodating than she was.  10% not because we are college students, 10% because you were bad at your job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison,2.8,2.81,2.916,,2.806
48,Terrance B.,"Somerset, NJ",0,2,,1.0,2017-12-26,The worse experience I ever had at a restaurant I would give zero stars if possible. They put me in a corner seat I guess to try and accommodate for the holiday time. But at least allow me elbow space. Then I ordered what I felt wasn't that complex of a burger and steak tacos. Took well over a hour to get the food as others around us got their food. Just for the manager to come over and offer to re cook my cold food that would of taken longer. I fuck with cheese cake factory just not this one every again. Straight TRASH!!! Waiter kept vanishing for what I think was on purpose. Good luck at this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=40,2.64,2.81,2.916,,2.742
1,Alcohol U.,"Chicago, IL",208,31,3.0,2.0,2017-12-29,"Not sure why I bother to review a place that is loved by so many who wouldn't dream of giving less than 4 stars, well not this bloke. I'm giving them 2 and that is being generous. Not sure what staff and managers think at the establishment. Maybe they think Mall traffic, so shitty service and behaviour is ok? That could be one possibility. Food is ok. I'll give them that. Service and attitude needs to change. Clearly. Just imagine, if they weren't at the local mall, what would it be like? Oh, and if you're thinking about ordering a slice of cheesecake to go, make sure you scream as loud as you can because people behind the counter are either deaf, or blind. I'm thinking both. I was always under the impression common sense was a common thing but as time goes by, I tend to think it is all bunch of hogwash! You could be standing there with a credit card out in the hand ready to be swiped trying to order and person behind the counter stares at you like you're there to inconvenience them. My final thought- It's not called mind reading, but more like paying attention to visual cues. I bet they don't teach that at the Cheesecake Academy.  That's all I got!

7,Puneet D.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",206,16,12.0,4.0,2018-01-05,I've gone here many times and usually the wait time is long on weekends. I like to call ahead and order some cheesecake and pick up for takeout. Never had any issues with this.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison,2.8,2.8,2.908,,2.8
30,Scott S.,"Hoboken, NJ",104,213,,2.0,2018-01-06,"I've always been a cheesecake factory fan - fun, pretty good food, awesome cheesecakes...although I'm so curious...why does every single Cheesecake Factory have this unbelievably slippery floor not found at any other dining establishment in the continental United States?  Anyway, back to Menlo Park... I was excited to hit up the factory after doing some holiday shopping - Naturally the place was packed but grabbed a couple seats at the bar. The bartender was so friendly and fantastic. Good start....However, once my lettuce wraps app arrived and i grabbed my little utensil pack, there was like a big piece of lettuce or cabbage or something stuck on the fork that didn't come off in the wash.  ew.  not the end of the world, but still, a bit gross...don't want to be reminded of the mediocre cleaning process that plates and silverware go through before i use them. I ask for a new fork and we are back in business. Everything went well after that - my guiltless tacos made me feel like i was in Puebla, Mexico (well not really, but they were still good). So, after the meal in the holiday spirit, we decided to give our server a cash tip (over 30%) and the rest of the bill on the card. Well well well, what happened next was my real issue with this establishment. Now, if you are someone who views Yelp as just a bitchfest for disgruntled venting customers, look no further, you've come to the right place. So some sneaky little devil at the restaurant decided to add a credit card tip on to the bill, thinking I wouldn't notice it. This obviously annoyed me, but not as much as what came after. We contacted the restaurant to ask for a manger. Manger came on the phone and couldn't give two shits....said he would find out about it and call back (not really caring about the criminal behavior or how this upset customers). After not hearing back, we called again - this time an office manager handled it and said there was no record from the prior manager, and offered a $25 gift card (which would be net $10 after the fradulent tip). okay, just buy your customers satisfaction. anyway, she at least made it seem like she cared..something to the tune of ""im sorry this happened to you"". Needless to say, a gift card never arrived (which i don't really want anyway), because with management like this, it's a reflection of the management of the corporation as a whole, and this lack of integrity probably spills over into other areas, lets say, cleanliness for example.  sooo i'll probably still eat at the factory, but certainly not this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=20,2.8,2.8,2.9,,2.8
9,Jeannie C.,"New York, NY",1,12,29.0,5.0,2018-01-08,"I love this place. I never have had a bad experience here. The food is good the atmosphere is nice. The waits are expected. You are going to have a wait on a Saturday night, if you don't want that this isn't a good place to go. The cheesecake is so good it takes me so long to pick one! The Mac and cheese balls are a must have. Without a doubt the best thing on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison,2.84,2.84,2.908,,2.84
