178,Steven L.,"Queens Village, NY",108,28,54.0,3.0,2016-10-22,"I came here to experience a pre opening dinner. The sever was very attentive but he can work on meal placement. Don't place the drinks on top of the meals and if the appetizers are not finished don't bring the entrees. I had the buffalo blasts for my appetizer which was a different take on a buffalo wing. I recommend having the boneless option. For my entree, I ordered the shrimp and chicken gumbo it wasn't bad but the rice was hard. The beer that I was served had a lot of foam, but overall it was not bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-elmhurst?start=160,3.34,3.34,3.34,3.34,3.3400000000000003

Everyone is super friendly and courteous. The place was nice and clean. The food was just perfect. The portions were generous and filling. The chicken madeira really was extraordinary...soft tender and delicious. The appetizers were really large almost a meal by themselves.

We came during off peak hours and still waited around 20min  Me and my friend really looked forward to this and it certainly didn't disappoint. We came with the mind to order the pasta and cheesecake, however the pasta was way DAMN filling(but delish) and we couldn't fit the cheesecake. (Thanks for that, CHEESECAKE factory)  I ordered the four cheese pasta, it was unexpectedly good because hearing 4 cheese it might be too cheesy, but it's actually not. It's blended with marinara sauce and isn't too salty.  My fiend ordered the shrimp and sausage pasta and it was actually really good, a bit spicy( for her, for me it tasted so weak spicy haha) but I personally thought it was a bit salty.  Service is definitely 5 stars. VERYYYYY good customer service. I hope they keep it up and that it wasn't just a first day attitude kind of thing.

My friend and I came for lunch on opening day, and we were very impressed with the service and the neatly organized layout. We were told 20 minutes but seated in 10 minutes. Our server was on point and courteous. We didn't want to eat huge entrees, so we ordered 3 small plates/appetizers: chicken samosas, crab bites and the Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls. All were great but I liked the crab bites the best. We shared the pumpkin pecan cheesecake, and it was divine. Complimentary warm bread and butter were great too.

Normally in LI, it would have been a 10-15 min wait so this was really nice! The bar and top tables are for walk ins and were full (you can tell it was mostly the employees of the mall which is really great since the food court can get pretty boring) Our server Jessica was AMAZING! She made us feel right at home and was attentive throughout our dining experience. She started off with the specials and even some recommendations. We ordered two types of Rolls (Avocado and Tex Mex) which were sooo good! And two entrees which we were so full, we took home left overs (which we did not mind at all!)  I also took home the Pumpkin cheesecake, which for each slice sold proceeds went to the local community to help feed the homeless. So it was extra yummy!

The problem is that I have made changes to the dish that the Kitchen agreed to, but when the dish arrived, it was missing some key ingredients. It was still very good, could have been better. The staff was welcoming and nice. Our server was missing at times and the other servers took our requests. Very professional on their behalf.  Another nice moment was when we first set down,  we were 4 adults and my baby boy.  We asked for a high chair and it was ready by our table and the hostess was so nice, she brought me some warm bread and a sliced banana for my baby without even asking...

88,Klone222 B.,"Rosedale, NY",19,58,9.0,5.0,2016-10-28,"Yum Yum Yum! Even if you are from Mars and dont like cheesecake, You need to come here!  Ambiance: Gorgeous. As we were lead to our seats I noticed the Bars had about Two T.V.s and about 8ish Seats. I did not try any alcohol but I noted that there was a large selection available. The seating can be great if you sit way in the back where it is intimate and private Or it can be kinda close to other parties in the middle where it is a bit louder.  Food: So finally after being seated we received the thickest menu I ever saw. It took me a while to decide between many great options. When the food came it was Oh So Tasty! My Diane Steak/Shrimp Campi Combo was well done and still juicy with some tenderness. My Date had the hibachi steak which was not as tender but just as tasty and delicious. You could taste the wine in the steak. The machpotaotes taste as good as they look in the pictures. The appetizers came out WARM! Loved that. Avocado Rolls and Toast Avocado. Quality Food!  Juniors Vs. The Cheesecake Factory (CHEESECAKE REVIEW): Get the Chocolate Hazel! You won't regret it & I think a portion goes to feeding the needy. I haven't had Juniors in a while so take this with a grain of salt (No Pun intended) but The cheesecakes here I found to be fresher and more tasty. I had the Fresh Strawberry & Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch & Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake  And they all were very smooth in taste and the perfect softness to the crust. I'm not a big cheesecake fan, I prefer ice cream cake but these cheesecakes were really good and not over the top. TRY IT! Customer Service: By far Daphnie and the others who also came to our table gave great customer service skills! She was very clear and thorough. We came on a Thursday night around busy after work hours 7 pm and waited 1 hour and 12 mins but I expected the long wait given they just opened this week. Its better to come here for brunch or lunch if you cant wait. Also I was told that they do not take RSVP yet. The staff here works as a team (Which I loved) So many people will check up on you. It was attentive without being too attentive or disturbing. My utmost compliments to Daphnie and The Manger (a chubby bald guy in a blue shirt). This team screams great communication skills. My water was always filled, & the appetizers came out at a decent time, followed by the food. The soft drinks did take a lil long. Cleanliness: Please note They did not have their letter grade up, which is important to me but the place was pretty much clean. My utensils were spotless (Not even the ugly water stain), My waiter put my knife ""sitting"" on the table (I loved that). My glass seemed clean and none of the waiters or waitresses or busboys walked around with dirty towels or stained shirts. Everything was neat and clean. BUT I WANT MY LETTER GRADE POSTED b/c It would help to know that the kitchen is clean. PS! They are one of those very few restaurants who still pack the food for you when it's time to go! I must have shed a tear or two for this when I realized I didnt have to do it myself. #FirstWorldProblems T.I.Ps: (1) There is NO COAT CHECK (2) At this time, You can not RSVP. First come first serve. Dont take the the little Buzzer past JCPenny (3) There is NO Separate PARKING. (Park in the Mall Parking Lot as this factory is part of the mall) (4) Dress Code: I saw a lot of couples the wait for two is crazy and they dress up/ very few families, and lots of groups of friends who dressed casually. Skinny leg jeans and cute shoes and cute sweater will do. Cute Chic/Not too dressy (5) Most Entrees are between 15$ and 22$. Some Small slice Cakes were 6-8$ Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-elmhurst?start=80,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000007
85,Patthara C.,"New York, NY",79,225,347.0,3.0,2016-10-29,"3.5 What a great addition to the area! Once I found out that Cheesecake Factory was opening, I knew I had to find out what the hype was about. Once we got here earlier this morning, there was already a long line outside.  As we walked to our seats, I couldn't stop but noticed how massive the establishment is; I'm impressed. We get to sit by the window area which was great because it was sunny out and it definitely has a nice vibe (think I actually prefer sitting around here than the main area). Since it was still earlier in the day, I decided to go for OJ ($4.95) and Spinach, Mushroom, Bacon and Cheese Omelette ($13.95). I would have given my first Cheesecake Factory experience 4 stars at least, but the wait though. It even took a while for water and orange juice to be served. I became hangry having to wait over half an hour for breakfast to show up. Our waiter dropped by twice to apologize since it is opening week, but it wasn't his fault.  Once the food came, I was happy again. Breakfast was surprisingly good, but I was also hungry. Can't also help but notice how big the portion was ... well worth the price.  I may come back for the food if I have more time to kill. I'd definitely come back though to get the cheesecake. I'm all for places that are big on sustainability and social impact.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-elmhurst?start=80,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004

4,Waheda I.,"Queens Village, NY",53,143,224.0,3.0,2016-10-29,"I'm not the type to go to a restaurant during its opening week. Everything is hectic and crazy. All that can be avoided by going a month or two later. Being my sister works there, me and a friend decided to stop by. In a sentence I can say, it was crazy.  We came in an 5 pm on Friday and was told that a table would be free in an hour and that we should come back. After the hour we come back and we're given a pager. When it vibrates that means a table is ready. We waited over an hour and half! We finally get a table and it was so hectic. The servers were all over the place. My friend got the wrong dish and had to wait over 45 mins to get her correct dish. Apparently that qualifies for a discounted price or a free dish?????? I always try not to give the wait staff a hard time but with all the waiting we did and to have the wrong dish served to us I guess I should have asked for something.  The food.......well I guess you can't have really high standards for chain restaurants. I paid $11 for 5 dumplings. That is outrageous anywhere. But of we hadn't ordered the appetizer we would have been sitting there without any food for an hour. At one point one of the 10 waiters I had asked if I wanted bread? Yes after 30 mins of nothing we'd like some bread. The pasta wasn't spicy. Creamy and mild. I guess the food is catered to American tastes.  The CHEESECAKE. That was definitely the highlight and worth every bit of the hype it gets. It was so creamy and decadent. Everyone should experience the Cheesecake that is offered here. Overall I'd say wait till the hype dies down a bit. Everyone is frazzled and crazy. Also those prices are crazy. Lunch special ends at 5 pm. And the prices are half! If you can, come before 5. You'd definitely save some money and hopefully avoid the crazy crowd.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-elmhurst?start=40,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004

My boyfriend orderd a burger well done but he received it medium rare and had to send it back. the waiter was very friendly and apologetic.The manager even came out to apologize and made sure we were ok.

I had to find someone to request my bill. She disappeared after I got my bill and another woman picked up my bill.

As they were about to seat us the host walking us over to the table realized that table was not yet available. About 5 mins later they found another available table and seated us. We were seated near where the entrance door from outside the building, which by the way is the most pointless door ever as that door should just be an exit door considering the front desk is really by the entrance inside the mall. We ordered drinks which took a few minutes to come. The food took about an hr to arrive. I've been to cheesecake factory before in other locations but this had to be the longest wait for food. I didn't mind it so much but I doubt it will make me want to visit again. Food was as I remember it to be... Decent. I highly recommend my order of Grilled steak tacos it's under their specialties. Drinks are usually what I like from here and maybe dessert. I was also told I should note that in the men's bathroom they had 2 urinals and one stall.

We went to eat there at around 1pm on a Friday and the place was packed to the gills. Make sure you call ahead with reservations because we ended up waiting for about 20 minutes for a table.  Everyone was super nice and efficient. As busy as the place was, no one was overwhelmed. So 5 stars for the managers, waitstaff and chefs as well. As for the food? Hot damn. I don't know what else to tell you other than it was out of this fucking world.  For 4 people, we ended up getting the guacamole egg roll and fried mac and cheese ball appetizers. For entrees: --I got the Steak Diane (delicious sauce and perfectly cooked steak) --Country chicken and biscuits (my girl went nuts over this and she's still talking about it). --fish tacos for my friend (they were delicious and not fishy at all) --and a bowl of mac and cheese for our friend's 2 year old son. For desert: The crunchy Nutella cheesecake that we all split (and couldn't even finish). PROS: -great food. Even though it's a big menu, every item on the menu seems fantastic. -great service  -they have health options CONS: - because of how busy it is, that plus the music they were playing through the speaker system, it can be a little loud...and if you have a kid, make sure you break ear phones because the 2 year old at the table kept saying how loud the place was. So just a FYI. - because the place is so new they really want to make a good impression. The problem with this was, we had about (not kidding) 3 people constantly checking in on us. So every few minutes someone else would come up to the table and say ""is everything alright?"" Then 60 seconds later someone else would say ""just checking to make sure everything is alright."" Then a few minutes later someone else would come up to our table and say ""just wanna make sure everything is okay."" Every time we told them we were fine.

368,Jalissa R.,"Maspeth, NY",29,4,,3.0,2016-11-06,"I don't like leaving bad reviews but i have to because I left kinda upset, first the wait we were told 10 mins we were sat in 25, I use to be a hostess and I know better to over quote then under quote especially if it's packed. Now let's start with our server Denise pretty nice lady, however she was a bit slow and forgetful all forgivable especially since this place just opened. We never received bread and other servers had to keep stopping at our table to offer us a refill, for the food itself boy was I pissed when we were told the appetizer we wanted they didn't have which was the fried mac n cheese balls which was fine but that meant I couldn't get that as my side which is what I normally get when I go to any other Cheesecake Factory . My husband and I opted for the hot spinach dip and chips it was good nothing special, what really threw me off was that when my husband ordered his ribeye they said they were out....so first Mac n cheese and now a ribeye????i was baffled how a restaurant could be out of something? Anyway I ordered the Parmesan and herb crusted chicken which was really good and my husband got the same thing and really enjoyed it. When it was time to order dessert we were so full but wanted to take dessert home we even conversed with Denise how we couldn't eat anymore and she said it is nice to eat at home in your pjs, we thought we were all on the same page that we wanted dessert to go, out comes Denise with 2 plates of cheese cake, we were confused especially since we joked about eating the cheesecake in our pjs so we tell Denise and she goes I thought you said you wanted it for here and took the plates back, my husband and I looked at each other a laughed in confusion since we did say to go twice but it's fine maybe she was overwhelmed they did double seat her which means 2of her tables were sat at the same time, me and my husband then a family of 4 which is unfair there should've been a 3-5 min gap for her tables to be sat. Now to the cheesecake it alone deserves 5 stars I got an Oreo cheese cake my husband got the s'mores cheesecake my god they were amazing if I never come back her for the food I will definitely come back for the cheesecake.

59,Cynthia D.,"Queens, NY",432,765,5483.0,4.0,2016-11-06,"Cheesecake Factory is truly amazing! Like many other Queens peeps, the nearest one for me was all the way in Long Island. I have been waiting for their grand arrival to Queens Center Mall since I first read about their plans to open here. The day we have all been waiting for is here - first store in New York City is open! This store is very elegant and grand looking! I mean look at those details from the doors to the ceilings! It's beautiful! There is a take-out section, huge bar with displays of endless bottles of alcohol, a fairly big dining area, more seatings in the patio section, and the huge kitchen towards the back.  My companion and I waited a week or two after opening because we already know how popular this place will be. We slipped in around 11:00 am on Sunday - table for 2 was available immediately! Win for us! However, when we walked towards our table, almost the entire restaurant was filled. Come early! My go-to dish here is the Shrimp with Angel Hair pasta dish. I always get it off the regular menu and you bet it is a huge portion! Angel Hair with large shrimp, garlic, lemon, herbs, and diced tomato. Although the dish I had today was a tad dry, the combination of flavors made it so delicious!  Fried Mac & Cheese. Four giant balls of mac and cheese inside of a crispy deep fried layer with marinara sauce then topped with cheese. They arrived to my table piping hot! So good! A nice starter for the table.   Oreo Extreme Dream Cheesecake. Oh yes baby, come home with me! Layers of fudge cake, oreo, and chocolate mousse. This is so heavenly delicious that you will dream about it for days to come! GET THIS!  Arnold Palmer. Lemonade and iced tea mix. Always a great drink to get! It comes with a sugar ring here!  This particular location has a bit of a wait for service and food that I can overlook for now.

The hostesses are absolutely clueless. I was taken to three different booths that were either dirty or had people sitting there.

I am so happy that they open one finally inside the Queens Center Mall and convenient from the Woodhaven Subway Station. I walked into the restaurant at 10:40am and barely anyway for a table though. I told the hostess that it was a group of 4 and I wanted a booth so she suggested like patio sofas.  One of my friends showed up and the other hostess seated us in an area next to the main dining which seems quieter. I guess it was the adult area with less screaming kids and crying babies lol I do love some cushion under my tushy =) I had the servers pulled down the blinds because it was way to sunny and going to ruin our #foodporn pictures  Two of my friends has been here for the Grand Opening so they picked a great spot for Sunday Funday Brunch today! My other friend has been to another location establishment as well so they definitely popped my Cheesecake Factory cherry hahahaha Our server Alisha B has a great personality, very attentive and provided excellent service! She brought out these yummy freshly baked wheat bread with oats and butter spread. I do love bread and I should've stop myself because I did get a bit full on it before my food came to the table.  Sunday Brunch Menu:  Rich: Bruleed French Toast with a side of Canadian Bacon (huge and thick slab of meat on the plate mmmmm)  Sally + Jane + me: Fried Chicken & Waffles Benedict was a popular dish at our table hehe mmm hubba hubba in my tummy...the benedicts had a nice flow but I wish it was a streaming of yoke onto my crispy fried chicken strips though. Pour some sugar on me oops I meant some maple syrup over my fried chicken strips and those crispy waffles.

No problem as we just talked until we got called. We were seated in the outer area. Quieter then the indoor. Our server Richard was really nice. Ordered. We got our drinks and had some bread. They had difficulties. I could understand that it just opened and got hit hard. After a very long time. I was not counting but seemed like 45 minutes over a manager came over and took care of us. She had us bring what we asked. Then our food came. We ate, ordered dessert. When we got the bill they really were good about the whole thing.

339,Arianna Y.,"Queens, NY",48,62,10.0,3.0,2016-11-08,"Not going to lie, I've always had good experience when I trekked out to the one on Long Island, and was super excited when I caught a glimpse of this place on a recent trip to QC Mall. My only problem is trying to settle on what to order. When the menu is damn near 10 pages long and everything looks amazing and you're the most indecisive person ever - ordering becomes anxiety-inducing! Came for lunch, and they have amazing lunch specials with a lot of options, served until 5. Trust me, if you've never been here before and see JUST the lunch-sized portion - you're mind is going to be blown by what a normal dish looks like. Alas, that's what this place is known for. I ate half of my meal, and still had a whole other large portion to take home. I ordered the meatloaf special, which was two large chunks of meat, along with mashed potatoes and gravy, and a corn succotash. I really enjoyed it, though my dining partner said that he felt that it was too breadcrumb-y and wished he could taste more meat. He ordered the ribeye steak, which I only had a quick bite of and was indifferent to, but he said it was tasty. Waiter situation was a little strange, had a guy approach at first and something was a little off... about him, then after serving us for like 10-15 minutes, showed up with another server that he claimed he ""told us about"", that she would be our new server, and he disappeared. They were pretty attentive, though, on top of checking in and refills, etc. Now, to the important part - the cheesecake. Yes, I'm that basic bitch that's all about the seasonal stuff   once fall rolls around, so you better believe that I ordered that pumpkin pecan, and it did not disappoint. Basically a layer of pumpkin cheesecake sandwiched between a pumpkin pie crust and topping. The crust was kind of hard to get through, but yummy nonetheless. My only gripe is a general one, and it's that they go way overboard with the whipped cream, which isn't even needed to begin with. Also tasted the white chocolate macadamia nut blondie one, which I had before a long time ago, and while you can't go wrong with that combo, it is excessively sweet, so be prepared for that. What can you really expect here, it's The Cheesecake Factory! It serves it's purpose, and that's all that matters.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-elmhurst?start=320,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.8920000000000003,3.3600000000000003

I was very excited when I heard about the location opening at Queenscenter Mall. Two of my girlfriends and my self decided to meet up for dinner, I was told the wait is 30 minutes which ended up being 1 hour. When we were finally seated we ordered drinks and appetizers and that portion was pretty fast. The waitress assured us our entree would be out in approximately 20 mins, we did not get our entrees until an hour and twenty minutes later. She came out once and explained that there was a mix up with their computer and our orders. We then asked to speak to a manager because it took another 20 minutes after her explanation and our food still didn't arrive at our table. We had to make a complaint before it happened.  At that point we just wanted to leave but we ordered desert to go and made it clear to them that we had to leave since we spent all of our time waiting. Our cheesecake didn't come out until 20 minutes after they made our to-go bags. That was absolutely the worst experience I ever had at a Cheesecake Factory. I am not going back until they have been opened for another 6 months. They need to train their staff properly and also educate them on the menu and it's contents. Our server didn't know there was sausages in the gumbo. And she didn't know how to grate the cheese. Half of it landed on my phone and the table.

The orders that were taken from the first waitress was correct, however, when finally received our orders two of dishes were not prepared nor delivered. Take in mind the time was also late after 9 and on a Monday. One of my guests were starving because both orders belong to this person (appetizer and entrée). The manager comes over to apologize, but by this time it does nothing as the food is still missing. Finally when the orders do arrive, they aren't prepared properly. Three of the orders did not taste good either and it was cold. By the time we paid the bill, there was nothing on the bill to compensate the frustration that we incurred, but because the fault was not of the waitress, she received her deserved tip. I do not think we will be going back to this location, but I like to give people another chance, but would like to stress that we were highly disappointed in the service and food quality. Would not recommend the Shrimp with Angel hair pasta (very bland), chicken marsala (which is normally good, but it was sweet and something was off) and spicy pasta with chicken (just wasn't good) Almost forgot to add we also ordered cheesecake which is the highlight of the place, but the cheesecake was semi frozen!

Here I am about to dig in to my cheese cake and look WTF I see.. a big portion of cheesed cake dug out . I am so disgusted and confused.

The waits were ridiculously long, but we did end up finding seats at the bar after half an hour of stalking the high tops. The service was pretty quick given the amount of people there for opening week. Our bartender always made sure we were taken care of. My only complaint is that the food and cheesecake took FOREVER to come out. I'm sure they were overwhelmed with orders, so I understand, it was just tough because we were all so hungry. If you're looking to get a drink here, get the pineapple moscow mule. It is delicious and has a gigantic slice of fresh pineapple in your drink. For dinner, I had the chicken bellagio (which is my go to dish here) and the tiramisu cheesecake. The chicken bellagio was smaller in portion size than at some of the other Cheesecakes I've been to, but the quality is better. It was also decorated very nicely. I really enjoyed the tiramisu cheesecake. It was light an fluffy, but it made me so thirsty afterwards. I had to chug three glasses of water just to feel slightly hydrated.

219,Tara S.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",43,250,220.0,3.0,2016-11-21,"Being a local, I was super excited about having a Cheesecake Factory close by. For starters weekend wait times will cost of about 1hour plus. If you are able to grab a seat in the bar area do it as there is no wait time for this area. Be warned it could get a little over whelming having ppl stare at you to see if your almost done eating so they can zero in lol. Service was good, just good. A bit of a wait to get our table cleared and there was a noticeable wait for our appetizers. The shrimp tempura to start was soooo yummy. We always get Buffalo blasts as well which was also very good. The Cajun jambalaya with chicken and shrimp, my bf had was actually really really good. I had the steak Diane minus the onions. My food had a hair in it at first but the got me a new one shortly. Shortly was about another 15 20 min- but I will say my food came out, tasty & hot. Originally when the bill came we did not receive a comped entree or discount. That was a lack on managements part. The initial manager didn't even check back on us when I did receive my food again. The waitress made it her business to get us a comped entree which was more then what we expected (a little acknowledgement of the hygiene issue in the kitchen and wait times would've been fine , 10 percent off or something from management). Would we go back? Def not on the weekend. On a weekday? Maybe.

The food we ordered... 1. Pineapple Moscow Mule- really good! Can barely taste the vodka. It was like pineapple juice. 2. Fried Mac and Cheese- loved it! Crunchy on the outside and cheesy inside. 3. Steak Diane (medium rare)- it was a bit overcooked at some part but it was still pretty good. Mashed Potatoes was pretty good as well. 4. Chicken Marsala and Mushroom w. Bowtie Pasta (forgot the name)- more to the sweeter side but still good.  5. Southern Fried Catfish- The catfish was really soft, which is great! Mashed potatoes ofc was good.  The only thing that I didn't really like was how slow the service is. It takes a while for them to serve all the food out, so expect that to happen. Either the chefs gotta learn how to cook faster or they gotta hire more chefs.  Overall, the food was pretty good so I didn't mind about the long wait. We were too full so we didn't get the chance to try some cheesecake but next time. The total was about $88 including tax, not bad.

The cheesecake is divine, and usually takes 15-30 minutes to get a to go slice depending on the day and time you drop by. A valid tip for those who are planning to visit; do expect to wait, and don't blame the staff for how long it takes to seat! they can't rush patrons out, so when they apologize and say they're doing their best, don't be rude and hasty because it's not their fault. I've been here about 6 times so far for cheese cake pick ups for my coworkers, and each time there's an argument about something inevitable. Everyone's excited about this place, so expect the wait that comes with it!  Also, to the woman who says a piece of her slice was eaten, it looks like a tiny piece came off a connected slice lol.

The wait was long and the entrance was too crowded so we decided to eat at the bar.  The food is the same as the Long Island location.  The waitress and bartender who helped us were extremely personable. They ran out of some things which left us disappointed. Also, the chicken pot stickers had way too much garlic and were almost inedible.  Overall I'd really recommend going to the Long Island location as opposed to this one. The space is significantly smaller with an equal if not larger clientele base.  There is absolutely no direction upon entering ; it's a literal clusterf*ck. I learned only later from the servers that as you enter, pickup orders (from the app) are to the right, reservations are directly ahead, and something else is to the left. When entering, you're literally in a giant, overcrowded space wondering what the hell is going on. The Long Island location has clearer directives on where to go and not nearly as crowded when you enter; they've also never ran out of things I've ordered so I assume they're run better....

304,Dornell S.,"Elmont, NY",70,10,10.0,1.0,2016-11-27,This is the worst experience I had with the Cheesecake Factory . I usually go to the one in westbury Long Island . The wait was two hours long . So I proceeded to go shopping and came back with in the waiting time to then being told  there additional 20 min extra wait .  Waited some more and was finally seated . We order our food  the waiter then disappeared  for 20 mins we had to ask for utensils. I then called for the manager after waiting for a hour for the food to come out to only be told the order would take longer because I order a steak middalion and salmon combo . The steak is usually a hockey puck sized I told her I usually go to the Long Island Cheesecake Factory and have never waited for a hour and 20 mins  for my food even on the busiest holiday exp Mother's Day  and Valentine's Day . When my order finally came my salmon was extra small  portion  and my steak was luke warm by that time after all that wait I lost my appetite . Their portions of food is nothin in comparison to Long Island.  the service is horrible I went to other steak houses and got bigger steaks rib eyes t bone and porterhouse steaks and the wait was never that long I explained to the manger but it fell on death ears because you can tell all she wanted to do was go home . Would not recommend this Cheesecake Factory just take the extra time and drive to westbury. Forgot to add  that they said it was free parking they would stamp my ticket the waiter took my ticket and never stamped it !! Went to  leave parking lot had to pay  smh so it took a total of 3 and half hours to get bad service.

154,Linda W.,"New York, NY",108,480,131.0,2.0,2016-11-29,"With the exception in Honolulu, I really can't say much for all other locations. The quality of food and service has really declined from the last time I visited the chain. My daughter was very excited upon learning the grand opening of a Cheesecake factory in NY! What 4 yr. old doesn't get excited over sweets & desserts?  The opening week was in late Oct. That was a major disappointment. It was chaotic with expected wait times to over 2 1/2 hrs. The host was overwhelmed and end up telling customers to come back next week. We end up grabbing a cheesecake for our daughter to go. And, that was a total nightmare! A single line form for ordering and another one for pick-up. Two cashiers were ringing all the customers while the pick-up line crammed all customers into the back and front of the exit doors. This push into the other line where customers were waiting to be seated. There was no management or structure whatsoever. Staff was flying all over the place. It was a zoo! We made the trip and return in the next two weeks. We ask for a table for 3. The host told us it would be a 40 minute wait. It turned into an 1 1/2 hr. wait. After you're called in when signaled on the device, you have to wait on another line to get seated. Once we were seated, the assigned waitress disappeared. As we approach one of the waitstaff for a manager. The waitress returned and gave us menus and ask if we want to place our drinks in addition to a bread basket. After our drinks were placed, she disappeared for over 20 minutes. The table across from us got seated after we did. They already got their order in with the bread basket and drinks. When she returned, she offered no apology for the wait. She hurriedly asked if we were ready to place our order. Once she took our order, she was gone! We had to flag her twice to ask for utensils and bread. Regular utensil was given to our daughter that is 4. She could barely manage with the big silverware.  The food was ok. I had the salmon. The sides were drenched in butter. My daughter had the chicken sliders with the fries. The sliders were less than appetizing. The chicken seem to have been left in the fryer for awhile. My husband had the burger with a salad. He was given fries instead. Normally, we would had asked to speak to a supervisor/manager on the side. Unfortunately, no one appears to know who the manager is as staff frantically runs back and forth. With our waitress disappearing half of the night, it was nearly impossible to address anything. We placed the last order for dessert- an ice cream sundae for our daughter and a cheesecake to go. Our waitress again hurriedly put the check on our table. We did not ask for the check since we were waiting for the dessert. The ice cream sundae had 3 scoops of vanilla and huge dollops of whipped cream. There was no hot fudge or cherry on top that kinda thing for a kid. We concluded this visit was the worse that you can possibly get from a waitress. I don't think we plan on returning!  A side note to management: please slow down the pace with the staff in the restaurant! It causes the environment to be more hectic and frantic than it really is. There are enough tables to seat everyone. It has to be addressed and organized better. It would nice for the waitstaff to remember and check in their tables once in awhile. The front has to be managed better for pick-up orders. Form a line to the side and have another cashier pack up the order so that it's ready instead of ringing customers back and forth. And, the wait times have to be managed better, give a more accurate wait time to the customers. This gives customers a false pretense that it's this amount of time when it's closer to 2 hrs. or more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-elmhurst?start=140,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.3120000000000003,3.0800000000000005

The bartender Terri was really sweet, attentive and courteous. Our long island iced teas were DELICIOUS and she made them with obvious expertise. We were a bit annoying, asking for things like napkins, the menu back and utensils but she got them to us right away. The decor and amtmosphere was really really nice for a chain resturant. I was expecting an applebees type of vibe and it was more of a fancy 5 star in manhatten type of place. The bar was stacked and gorgeous. The mashed potato tots were delicious and the firecracker shrimp was just tiny fried shrinp w a delicious chipotle aioli. I ordered the southern fried catfish with mashed potatoes, corn, green beans and remoulade. Amazing!!! Very large porportions! I got three pieces of fish a healthy serving of mash and the remoulade was fantastic. The absolute star of the night was definitely rhe mac and cheese though!!

I'm not ever sure where to start .. should I start with Teri's outstanding service or the cute little personal table we had at the end of the bar .. or the Mac and cheese side; the shrimp or the loaded tater tots app?! Ok I'm rambling. So my best friend and I decided to give the Cheesecake Factory a go after debating where to eat on this rainy Wednesday night. We show up and are told it's a 30 min wait--not so bad. All of a sudden a man in a black shirt tells us we can sit at the end of the bar if we'd like. We agree and it is the cutest little drop down table from the bar (but is still connected to the bar) Teri greeted us within seconds of sitting down. Napkins menus and utensils were brought over a few moments after. We ordered 2 Long Island Iced Teas. For $11.50 each l, we agreed it was probably the best L.I.T we ever had. For starters .. firecracker shrimp with some sort of aioli sauce, and loaded TaterTots that also came with an aioli type sauce. The shrimp were cooked to perfection .. not too overly breaded. The TaterTots were just jaw dropping.. it was a creamy bacon cheese mashed potato like filling inside a crunchy shell of a TaterTot.. amazing !! I ordered my usual .. spicy chicken sandwich, but this time with a side of Mac and cheese !! Oh my the Mac and cheese .. like no other !! HANDS DOWN best I've ever ate in my life. I kept having to shoo my friends fork away from it.. my mistake was to let her taste one bite .. but one bite and she had been hooked !!! The spicy chicken sandwich was great as always with the chipotle aioli and delicious French fries. My friend Anjelica had one of the specialties, the catfish, and absolutely loved it. 3 overly big fluffy soft breaded slices of catfish with mashed potatoes and string beans... Amazing. Teri made sure everything was up to par as our night went on and we ate away. First time at this location but definitely not my last. Have been coming to the Cheesecake Factory for years and now there is one right in my hometown. Thank you for the excellent service, Teri, and thank you to the Cheesecake Factory for the amazing food; atmosphere; staff and ALWAYS HITTING THE SPOT !!

74,Xiao Ling Z.,"Queens, NY",169,168,425.0,4.0,2016-12-04,"The Cheesecake factory is by far my favorite restaurant chain; they have awesome decor (and this is consistent for all the chains I have visited) and a large selection of different cuisines to choose from (perfect for those indecisive nights). In NYC, the only Cheesecake factory that was available would be the one in Long Island (and that kind of travel was intense for those who did not have access to a car)-- so you can tell that this new one came as a wonderful surprise. If you're questioning the fact that it is in the QCM, worry not because the place is relatively large-- and is a BIG HIT. In fact, for the first 3 weeks (maybe longer?), the wait for dinner was a disgusting 2-3 hour wait (I would know, I tried) on a Friday night. I think the hype has gone down a bit now. For appetizers, I ordered the spinach and cheese dip with nachos. I know, ugh.. why did I do that? It's kind of bland when it comes to pairing with hardly salted nacho chips-- I would not advise unless it's your thing. I would normally order avocado dip with nachos, but I decided that a change would be interesting (it was not). I also ordered a Skinny Mojito (which is ""essentially"" a normal Mojito with less calories?)-- but it tasted REALLY fruity and had hardly any taste of alcohol (I really hope that it wasn't a virgin now...). For the entree, my partner ordered the Filet Mignon for about thirty bucks and I ordered the beef tacos. The Filet Mignon was super flavorful (no need for sauce, salt, or pepper)-- oh my goodness, I don't think I'll be going back to Outback Steak House (sorry... okay, maybe I'll go back for their bread). The beef tacos came as 4 tacos and was super bland (unfortunately)-- the lime juice helped a little bit and the fact that the tacos were very filling made me feel a little better, but the lack of flavor was disappointing and though I do not hate it, I would not go for it again. At the time of my visit, there was a deal going on where if you purchased a $25 giftcard, you would get 2 slices of cheesecake (redeemable in January). My partner and I purchased one giftcard each and we were able to apply it to our meal. We will be coming back for those free slices of cheesecake next year (get it? because it's December now). **A few weeks earlier, we purchased a cheesecake for a relative's birthday, it was MM MM GOOD :) Though my choice of food was not the best, I'm going to come back and try everything else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-elmhurst?start=60,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.352,3.0400000000000005

I spoke to my staffs and they said u changed ur mind and they showed u the cake and u agreed to switch from Godiva to red velvet cake""..I was stunned...first and foremost, they did not show me the cake before putting it inside the bag..so without hesitation, I told her to pls review ur camera to see who is making up stories...she said, I will call u back and see what I can do..for the meantime, I passed the phone to my husband to speak to the manager..my husband wants to know when is she calling back..the manager (whose name is Kaitlin) was in a rush coz she said it's a busy Sunday for them..didn't give any importance to our complaint..she said she won't know what time she is calling us back..not very friendly and clearly doesn't listen to our sentiments...we decided to drive back to queens from Yonkers just to personally speak to her..she put us on hold for another 20 mins and she got back saying..""ur wife was right, we reviewed the camera and they didn't show the cake to her""..it was fine with us, we were ready to pick up the cake..as soon as we enter the restaurant, we looked for her..we were already calm..she walked towards us, with a very unfriendly face..no charisma..no sincere apology..she just said, ""I got ur Godiva cheesecake""..her apology was not sincere at all..she said, ""it was miscommunication""..I told her, ""look, there is no miscommunication in the first place..you know that your employee lied and you trying to cover them up and made ur customer become a liar""..She was holding the cake while we were talking..I told her, ""I'm sorry I will still call the corporate about this coz I felt disrespected as a loyal customer of cheesEcake factory""..she suddenly said, ""oh, ur still going to call corporate???"" With a raised voice..I told her, I want to speak to ur staffs who made up stories that I was liar and they owe me an apology..she said, ""sorry, I dont want my staffs to talk to the customer""..that answer didn't feel right to me..the next thing we know, she left the cake on the table and turned her back on us..she said, she is very busy and she needs to leave.very disrespectful manager and does not know how to handle upset customers and does not know how to handle pressure at all...another manager came up to us named Eric..he was great..he listened to us and gave his time...i told Eric the same thing that I am going to call corporate..and his response was great..he said, I respect ur decision and u have the right as a customer...I wished I would have spoken To Eric earlier, than the useless manager named Kaitlin..I am going to file my formal complaint to the corporate and I want to make sure that actions will be done..this kind of manager should never be hired in a great company like Cheesecake Factory..she does not deserve the position...and the two staffs who lied should also be reprimanded...I work for patient care and I make sure I respect each individual...coz everybody deserves time and respect at all times...

My friends and I placed our order only to have her come back 25 minutes later to claim that she would check with the back to see what was going on. The thing is that we ordered the Seared Tataki Tuna Salad, which shouldn't have taken incredibly long to make. Nonetheless, we watched as other people who came in after us receiving their orders before us. Mind you, we came in about 15 minutes after they opened! The salad was pretty good and refreshing, nothing to write home about but satisfying enough. The menu is crazy long, practically like a book but I immediately flipped to the cheesecake section. My friends and I went for the Salted Caramel Cheesecake and that was honestly the only highlight of our visit. That one slice of cheesecake could be split between 2 people!! It was just so creamy and the salted caramel layer at the top balanced the cream cheese portion nicely. I loved that the crust was nice and moist too! And the fact that there was little flakes of salt to provide that extra crunch was the cherry on top. A little side note: I asked the waitress to bring out the cheesecake as soon as she took my plate away because we were running late on time. She came back to the table to collect everyone else's dishes 10 minutes later and asked if we had placed an order for the cheesecake already.  Service is definitely lacking here.

373,Joey D.,"Omaha, NE",0,3,,1.0,2016-12-24,"Worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. I met a friend here for dinner and I arrived before her and I was seated before she got there. I waited at my table for about 15 minutes and was not asked if I needed anything until she got there. Not even served a water. Once she arrived the waiter came up and we ordered. We got spinach dip as an appetizer and it was ok. We ordered our entrees as well. My chicken Marsala was fine, but she ordered the Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic. When she received it, it was simply chicken and noodles. There were no peas, mushrooms, pancetta, or tomatoes. We told the server and he offered to bring out the missing ingredients. We found this odd because we did not want a plate of the missing ingredients so we asked for it to be made again. After 45 minutes, we still had no replacement and we asked the waiter where it was. He said he would go check and another 20 minutes passed with nothing. We finally called for a manager and he went to check on it. 15 minutes passed and our food finally came out. The lady brought our food to the table, dropped it aggressively in front of my friend and said ""you're welcome"" without asking if it looked okay. She gave us no opportunity to say thank you and we were blatantly disrespected. We called the manager again and told him what had happened. He simply apologized and was not offering anything else. I had to tell him that I was not paying for her food and he finally said he would take it off and offered us cheesecake. I was ok with the outcome the manager offered, but I felt like this all could have been avoided if the staff here was professional and knew how to properly treat their guests. At the end of the day the rude lady who delivered our food caused the company to lose $30+ and she needs to understand that if she acts like that she should find a job somewhere else.

My mom had bang bang shrimp dish with coconut and my aunt had Chicken & Shrimp gumbo. I have to say all 3 dishes were great. The burrito was huge & could feed at least three people. The gumbo was very favorable and the bang bang shrimp had a sweet coconut flavor to it. Of course we took Cheesecake home, I had the Reese'a pieces Cheesecake.

Originally we were quoted a 55-70 minute wait time (at 3:10 pm) so we walked around the mall for a bit and came closer to the door around 55 minutes later. We checked with the hostess to make sure we hadn't been called and she said the wait would be about 20 minutes later than they said. She was really nice and we were willing to wait. Finally we had a seat around 4:30.  Once we experienced the service, we realized why their wait times to even get a table are so long! While nice, our server was just absent most of the time (and we really don't like overly attentive servers, just reasonably prompt service!). It took over 10 minutes to get our drinks and we ordered food once the drinks came at 4:45. In the meantime, another couple was seated next to us and had a very attentive server who immediately greeted them with bread and water. They ordered food about 10 minutes after us. Their entrees arrived about 20-25 minutes later and our food hadn't arrived yet. For reference, we ordered the lunch BBQ chicken salad and lunch Louisiana pasta while they each had more complex meals that should take longer to prepare. They were finished with their meal when our server finally came over to tell us it would be about 5 more minutes, they were just waiting on the pasta. Finally we got our food at 5:35, 50 minutes after we ordered it. The food itself was good, completely consistent with every Cheesecake Factory I've visited before. Our waitress was nice and got every part of the order right, but the wait times for everything was abysmal.

We were seated at 9:55 and 10 minutes later my waitress came and took our full order. 10 minutes isn't SO bad, I understand you guys are SOMEWHAT busy; it happens, and based on the waitress's bland and robotic introduction I figured she was new.  Appetizer came out in 5 minutes, it was a salad so that made sense. Half a point for that. Everything was ordered at 10:05... appetizer came out at 10:10... but here's what really pissed me off; we got our food at 10:55! 50 minutes for a medium steak and some al dente pasta with shrimp that takes 20 minutes tops to make? Me and my girlfriend waited and waited and waited... I was patient up until about 45 minutes in and asked to speak to a manager. I had to ask a hostess because there was NO MANAGER MAKING THEIR ROUNDS TOUCHING TABLES, SO NO ONE WOULD NOTICE THAT WE DIDNT EVEN HAVE OUR ENTREES. The hostess informed a manager and said someone would be with me; but guess what, no one came until the food came out another 10 minutes later. The manager himself ran the food and apologized because the kitchen was backed up (I appreciate the apology) but let's be real, your kitchen wasn't backed up. To be honest, you guys weren't even busy. I know what busy is, I actually manage THE MOST BOOKED AND VISITED RESTAURANT IN THE CITY; so yes, I'm very familiar with the industry. I really don't expect anything for minor mess ups in restaurants, but then the bill comes and I'm charged for EVERYTHING including the MEDIOCRE food that took about an hour for me to get. Seriously, not even desert as an apology? Being from the industry I sure damn would NEVER charge a person who waits more than 25 minutes for their entrees, NO MATTER HOW BUSY MY PLACE IS.

We received our bread at the table 2 minutes prior to getting our appetizers. For appetizers we had guacamole and calamari. The guacamole was very refreshing whereas the calamari was VERY salty. If you're a fan of calamari, refrain from ordering it here.  For my entrée I had the garlic noodles with chicken, it didn't have asparagus or mushrooms as it stated on the menu, but I had no time to even let my server know because he was never anywhere to be found. In addition, the noodles were very bland, dry and needed more sauce. By the time I saw my server I was already done eating and mentally checked out. I've worked in the industry for years and this has to be the one of the worst restaurants as far as hospitality goes. Whatever happen to adhering to the steps of service or the MOD touching a table to ensure their guests are fine?  RECAP Appetizer: The guacamole was refreshing whereas the calamari was almost inedible.  Entrée: Subpar and isn't a direct reflection on what's on the menu description.

But the takeout service was excellent, considering most people wouldn't bother making effort for  to-go orders. But the young lady manning the dessert section and taking orders was very efficient. Not friendly or pleasant, but clearly doing her job and wanting to do it well.  Gets busy very quickly -- I was there right around when it opened, no later than 11:30 if that, and people were already steadily coming in. I overheard from the Host stand that they don't take reservations.  The food: Fish Tacos -- really enjoyed this! Had them grilled, and we liked the sauce. It's described as chipotle sauce, but it has a heaviness to it that tasted like a tangy/zesty mayo. Overall, good!  Factory El Grando burrito -- OK, this should NOT be classified as a burrito. You envision a rolled up tortilla stuffed with food that you can hold with your hands? Yeah, this is laid down flat, and not even rolled that well. So kind of seems like a giant Enchilada. A bit disappointing. Need to reevaluate the description. Lemoncello cream torte  -- Didn't care for it, a bit too tangy for me, and the middle pieces of cake seemed hardened. I initially thought it was lady fingers but that didn't match the description. And never been a big fan of streusal on top of any dessert.  Fudge layer cake -- Very rich cake. Fudgy ganache like icing on the outside, and in between the layers of cake a sweet buttercream frosting. And chocolate chips on the outside icing as well.  Tiramisu -- gave a giant square piece! Was much bigger than I've gotten anywhere else. This lasted me days. Would come back here for takeout, probably those fish tacos.

329,Andria A.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,39,14.0,4.0,2017-02-11,"Came here on a Saturday evening around 4:45 and was told it would be an hour wait for a party of four. And boy did they mean an hour we were called around 5:34 or so. The wait was a little frustrating not because of the time but because their pager only works as far as JC Penney on one side of the mall and only on that floor. I recommend they get a text system so you can enjoy the mall and come back when your table is ready. Nevertheless we were seated, I have to say that the restaurant is dark you really have to struggle to see the menu. We were served sourdough bread that was a little hard and didn't taste good. They also never bought us plates so we ended up with crumbs everywhere as did the table next to us. The pumpernickel bread was much better and served warm. We didn't order  drinks just a couple of waters with lemon, for our entree I had the white chilli chicken it's on the skinnylicious menu it was nice and flavorful. My cousin had the mashed potatoes with the pork chop he said the pork chop was flavorful and the mashed potatoes were excellent. My mom had the Louisiana pasta which I had a taste of. The chicken was well breaded and fried. Lastly my cousin said her steak was wonderful and lean. We also ordered the cheesecakes personally I prefer Juniors downtown brooklyn but their variety is welcomed.

But I will say this is by far one of the worst experience I've had at a Cheesecake Factory establishment.  We came to the mall to shop around for my little SIL birthday. We know this place can get busy so we came by to ask for the wait time for a table of 7, the hostess told us about an hour thirty mins to 2 hours!  At first we were hesitant but my little SIL hasn't ate here before so we decided to wait. Knowing it may not be that long. We waited some by shopping around. Came back in 45 mins and our table is ready.  Service is horrible. Let me compare this experience to going to see a doctor. You go in and you have people who come in and out of your room to remind you that the doctor IS coming. In this case it's the manager. The waitress kept coming back and forth to give us our drinks to take our orders but after that we didn't see her for a good 25 mins. She then comes and tells us the kitchen is working on the soup and she didn't forget. Honestly by this time we were full from our two baskets of bread my uncle said we should just leave. I told my little SIL that she should've stuck with just going to hot pot, her initial decision but her sister persuaded her about CF.  We sat at our table for 30 or 35 mins our food comes but the soup doesn't. By now the doctor comes in, the manager. He ask us how the food is, well we just got it so we didn't get a bite yet. He says the soups were cancelled since we told them.we didn't want it anymore after we got the food. We say yes, just to forget about it. He then says ok, enjoy. No apology for the shit service. The long wait on food, on soup on getting our drinks. So it's whatever. We know we won't be coming back here ever. Then the doctor (manager) leaves. So we waited a total of 2.5 hours including waiting time to wait some more inside and see the doctor for 2 mins. Didn't know I was paying with health insurance tonight. On a serious note this is the experience here tonight is exactly the one you would experience at a hospital or doctors office. Either way you lose.  They ended up wanting to give the soups for free to us. We couldn't enjoy it because we had all this big portion sized food in front of us.  The food 1/5 stars. No flavor. They got an order wrong but by this time we didn't even want to say anything anymore. It's ridiculous!!!!  Wished we would have just stuck with hot pot tonight.

After waiting more than 1 hour for the table our waitress ask for drinks, we ordered 2 bottles of wine and place an order. The pouring of each glass was terrible, it seems as she wanted us to order 2 more bottles. When the food came 2 people were left without their order, one of them the birthday one. The waitress never came back to check, after 5 minutes we manage to get the attention of a manager and told him we were missing 2 plates. He came back 10 minutes later with only one, without a word he left, still no sign of our server, we wait another 10 minutes, and the person without a dinner call another server and told her she did not want her salmon anymore. 5 minutes later the server came back with the salmon, after been told we did not want it anymore, she left without an apology. When dinner was over we ask for her to light a candle for our birthday person, she came back with a glass filled with whipped cream and chocolate syrup.

The staff very friendly and sweet, BUT the service was a bit slow, (got a soup and had to wait for the spoon) My biggest complaint here is the price of the cocktails, got 2 Mojitos for $12.50 EACH!

42,Erica F.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",500,332,1635.0,4.0,2017-03-26,"I for the longest time believed that this restaurant was only for cheesecake!  The ambiance and the decor is pretty upscale and pretty well done.   They not only have some great itens for lunch and dinner but they also have a skinny menu for those who are watching their calorie intake.  The regular menu and the skinny menu have the calories listed next to all items and that made me really happy as i can be aware of what i am ordering.  They also have some great drink options like mojitos with different flavors and skinny drinks as well. Just be aware of the bottles of beer as they do not serve them very cold, if you are a beer drinker that can be a bit upseting.  We had items from the skinny menu, i had a flat bread and a salad, the flat bread was amazing and only 280 calories. As the salad was a little more caloric 400 cal but it was great and it had some oriental inspired dressing that made the dish that more special.  We went all the way on the skinny mojitos and they were great! I had a couple cause i couldnt stope as they were so yummy. For dessert we had to have one of the cheesecakes, we shared the banana cheesecake and 3 ppl could share one slice with no problems, so if you have a couple of good friends sharing is not a bad idea it is plenty for everyone.  The prices can be sneaky so be aware of the prices if you are on a budget.  I will definetly come back here for more cheesecakes and yummy skinny food. They portions are pretty fair for the price, the cheesecake options are endless, just be careful with the drinks as their prices can jack up the bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-elmhurst?start=20,2.24,2.41,2.41,2.7039999999999997,2.3420000000000005

The issue I have is with their food. We came during happy hour since I had a hour to kill before I could pick up my phone from the Apple Store.  We got a table without having to wait.. ordered a few items. Already had lunch not too long ago, so we weren't hungry. The waitress was very busy but was attentive.  I've had the sweet corn tamales before and we thought they'd be the same...Before it came resting on corn husks and were really quite good. Now it sits surrounded by a weird sauce that was salty?? Did not care for it, corn tamales don't need a rich over-seasoned sauce...that's what crema is for. It actually over powered the sweet corn. Don't ruin this dish with unnecessary sauce. Less is more sometimes. Change it back! It was much better before and now you guys screwed it up.  The Buffalo blasts were horrible. A favorite of diners who actually like Cheesecake Factory, unbelievable. Ridiculously salty... it was also soggy. the chicken was odd. Like mashed up chicken wrapped up and not fried well. I could only eat one piece and I had to force myself. It would've been better if it was crispy like it's supposed to be. I took it to go since I don't like throwing away food but I gave it to my brother who likes extremely salty food.  The only decent thing I ate was the southern fried chicken slider. It was not over-seasoned and the chicken managed to be crispy. I ate one and took the rest to go since my stomach felt like exploding from all that sodium.  There was also an error on our receipt. Most diners don't bother checking if everything is correct normally. L never checks... so I have to, the nasty Buffalo blasts were charged regular price whereas everything else was happy hour pricing. Human error? A bit sneaky hm... whatever... I'm happy I caught it, the waitress fixed it right away.  Even at Happy Hour pricing the food was not worth the price. Cheesecake Factory is nothing but cheap, mediocre food priced high and over-seasoned to the point that your taste buds must be dead to enjoy.  At least the desserts are still decent but they're not made on the premises... it's not like classically trained chefs are dying to work at Cheesecake Factory, even home cooks have more skill.  Perhaps if your two main ingredients weren't butter and salt, the calorie and salt intake would be much lower and healthier. I guess if I want food that tastes fresh...I'll just cook it myself which I normally do or go to a real restaurant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-elmhurst?start=40,2.2,2.36,2.36,2.2760000000000002,2.2960000000000003

They are open from 11:30 till 11:00, so 7 hours to go and they are out of God knows how  many things. 4) Once served, five different staff members came by within the first 7-8 minutes to ask if 'everything is ok?'.  Really annoying. 5) They have a ridiculous amount of different types of cheesecake, but no pineapple cheesecake, which is a staple here in NYC. Blueberry, strawberry, pineapple, cherry and plain are the norm mostly anywhere. Come to think of it, I don't remember seeing blueberry either.... THE FOOD Philly cheese steak was extraordinarily greasy. I LIKE a greasy chees steak, but this was dripping in grease. There was probably no more than 2 ozs. of steak on the sandwich.

I want to say nearly an hour - but you can't expect much when you're relying on customers to finish and leave. It's nearly 8pm and they're having a good time. It's a good sign when the guests don't want to leave! But they should provide a more realistic wait time. It was very helpful with the hostess updated me with how many tables were ahead of me when I asked. That gave me a good idea of what I was in for. We were seated in the outer section, street view. It's closed off from the main dining area, much quieter, kind of loved it.  I forgot our server's name, but she was the most pleasant. Whoever you are with your Star Wars tie: you're wonderful and don't change.  The food is certainly better than what I expect from a chain. Their loaded potato tots are like miniature baked potatoes in your mouth. The burger buns were perfectly toasted and so fluffy. I think that was the most impressive of the burger. Love a good bun. Now for the cheesecake. We ordered to go because the way I feel about cheesecake should not be displayed in public places. With that said, their Oreo Extreme cheesecake is so delicious. Adam's Reese's is also great, but it's much heavier, probably because of the caramel. If you want to try their cheesecakes, go all out. No need to play it safe with the classic. These signatures are signatures for a reason.  Bring your patience, plan ahead. If you look them up on Google Maps, it'll show you the busy level by the hour. For a weekend night, though?

103,Wailana W.,"Brooklyn, NY",17,244,889.0,1.0,2017-04-14,"My prerequisite for our late dinner was fast, easy good and not too expensive.  I got none of the above.  In the past, when I have been to a CF, it's been in Jersey at the mall and while not fine dining, the experience I recall was not too bad.  Here at Queens Center at 10:30 pm, there's no parking on the street so you have to park in the mall garage (and pay for parking) and have to come back outside to the street because there's no access to mall entrance during its closed hours, in order to enter the restaurant.  With a half hour to closing time, there were still about a dozen tables still eating.  Ordering is no easy feat with their extensive menu with all the calorie counts.  Psychologically, it works, at least for me that I am not apt to order something that is 2000 calories and then a cheesecake for another 2000 calories.  It definitely works as a deterrent and reminds me how fattening dairy and carbs are.  The appetizer of fried calamari was good, fried, yes but if shared, not horrible but a bit salty for my bf's taste.  I opted for the chilled grilled ahi tuna with the wasabi aioli on the side over white rice and veggies.  What I got was tuna that looked like it was cut with a butter knife, a little rough around the edges which I honestly don't mind.  Tuna prepared this way is really rare or raw and it was correct for the temp but it seems they followed the same protocol for the rice and veggies.  The first mistake was they used long grain rice which is incongruous to the dish since medium or short grain would be better match.  That's not even as important as the fact, the rice was underdone and cold.  That was my main turn off.  I noticed CF has quite a few dishes with white rice so they should have a better handle on how to prepare and serve it.  The veggies also, shiitake mushrooms, bean sprouts and snow peas were neither raw nor cooked.  It had an undercooked taste to it.  I appreciate the fact that they were probably striving for a quick Asian stir fry but they should continue striving  a little more as it wasn't cooked.  My aioli that I asked to be put on the side was not present at all but that was okay.  I am not a big fan of mayonnaise-y dressings any way.  They're also laden with extra calories.  I made a relatively low caloried dish even more low caloried as I couldn't eat the rice and didn't have the dressing.  The veggies had they been cooked a little more would have been finished.  My bf's go-to dish other than a steak, is a pasta alfredo mixed with a pesto sauce.  They accommodated by giving extra pesto on the side which he mixed in himself in his Alfredo.  From what I saw and tasted with half a strand of fettucine, he was more successful than I was in my selection.  His strawberry cheesecake was light and fresh, probably better than the iconic Junior's.  He ate half the cheesecake and brought half home which he later finished. All in all, there's only half a success story.  The service was also uneven, with no plates or utensils on the table even after the appetizer was served.  We finally flagged down another server to get a set and then our server comes later with another set saying she had to find the plates, etc. intimating that's why it took so long.  A proper resolution to this awkwardness would be, apologize and take back the second set of plates and utensils in hand.  But no, she proceeded to put down the second set so now our small 2 person table had  8 forks, four knives, 4 napkins.  That was insensitive and lazy on her part to not bring back the unnecessary sets.  Similarly, when I first sat down and as I was taking off my coat, with my hand half in the sleeve, she hovered over me to hand me the menu.  Our server needs to learn how to adjust to the customer's situation and not go through the mechanical motions.  She needs to be more intuitive.  It should be about satisfying the customer and not about her.  Let me spell it out in case management reads this and is open to some customer service advice. If the customer has no hands available to take the menu, the server should place it down on the table rather than force the customer to take it with her hand still in her coat as she taking her coat off. If the table doesn't have plates and silverware, get some quickly but if the customer already got some while you were away, don't give them the extra set in your hands for no reason other than the fact you don't want to feel like you wasted your time ""looking"" for them.  So the clincher is the meal cost us nearly $90 for 2 people.  Next time, if we need fast, good and inexpensive, I would go to the neighboring Joe's Crab or Shake Shack or even Burger King.  I am not adverse to chains but this reminds me how bad things could be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-elmhurst?start=100,2.68,2.43,2.43,1.988,2.5300000000000002

She even went to the table right next to us and laughed and smiled at them and then would get to us and drop the niceness and just do everything but sprint away from us.  It was honestly so insulting when she flat out ignored my boyfriend who was trying to get her attention to let her know she had made a mistake with the bill. So not only was Erika Mae rude and neglectful, but she couldn't even be bothered to bill us properly!

This is after waiting for 30mins at least before being told that they ran out of one of our orders. The manager offered us a free cheesecake for the inconvenience but when I asked for the bill from another waitress as I can't seem to find where our waitress went, the complimentary cheesecake was billed until I pointed it out to our waitress. Have to get our cheesecake to go instead of eating it there as it was almost closing time. This is only after I stood up to look for the counter just to pay the bill so we can leave and remained standing by our table. Almost wanted to just walked out of there after paying the bill at the front instead. And to top it all, a party of 7 people arrived after us but got served and left before us.

First they tried to seat me where there was no air conditioning on an 80 degree day without asking. They move us to another table. Fine. We get greeted by the first waitress 1:10PM. She takes our drink order. Within minutes, she brings over another waitress. She explains that her allergies are bothering her and she is going to take a break. Not a prob. The 2nd waitress asks what we would like to eat. I ask her a couple of questions and explain that I can not eat any spicy food as well as explain my food allergies.  I ask if the BBQ Chicken Pizza was spicy she answers not to me but then again I am Mexican so nothing is spicy to me. Uh really?? Anyway I said how about the Pepperoni Pizza? She answers oh no that is not spicy at all.. I ordered that as a lunch special with a side salad. She tells me that it is a garden salad but for $1.00 more, I could upgrade to a Caesar Salad. I said sure, sounds great. My son orders a pasta dish. It is now 2:00PM by the time the food comes. I take a bite of the pizza and the pepperoni is spicy. It took 10 minutes to get her attention. I tell her I am sorry but this is too spicy for me. She asks with attitude if I would like something else. I tell her no because I do not feel like waiting almost another hour for food. She says OK I will take it off the bill I said great.  At this point because of her attitude, she just really started pissing me off so I asked for a manager she's like OK I will get one for you. I wait 10 minutes nothing. Now the original waitress comes back to me and said is there a problem I said yes I would like to speak to a manager. Another 10 minutes goes by. Finally I asked someone else I'd like to speak to a manager. By the time the manager comes to the table it is now 3 o'clock. He apologizes I tell him everything that happens and he offers to take it off the bill. I said yes absolutely that would be great. I get the bill and now they are charging me $10.95 for a side Caesar salad. My head is a back to explode at this point from all the incompetence and I'm experiencing. I asked for a manager again and he comes over and he has taken it off the bill. Then he offers me something else and I said no I don't want anything he said maybe a piece of cheesecake on us I said sure. I get the bill back and now the waitress has charged me for the cheesecake which was supposed to be free as per the manager.  I finally started yelling at the original waitress that came over and said really this is all ridiculous the service was horrible, the food was horrible and I want the bill corrected. She sends back the original waitress with the corrected bill. I ask the waitress for a copy of the voided receipt and tell her please don't take forever. She says to me be patient with an attitude. Finally another manager comes over to me with the corrected bill and a copy of the original receipt. I said to her your staff is rude, the food is horrible and I will never be back here. It is sad because I have been there before and I used to like it. Eat here at your own risk.. Just know that you will not be served on time, the staff is rude and don't expect a manager to come over right away if you have a complaint.

They fail on food mainly and end results in service 2nd to that! I can't understand how the menu offerings are the same across most locations and yet they fail! But fail they do here easily. If you've ever experienced other locations you would totally get what I'm saying once you've dined here. Both my family and I absolutely love Cheesecake Factory as a franchisee no matter the locations usually but somehow that one team one dream action plan doesn't come in to play at this location. While the dishes we ordered weren't the worst they failed to be the very best, maybe I should've never veered from what was tried and true but that really shouldn't ever be the case! The Mac~n~cheese balls in my opinion were God awful, fried hot on the outside but luke warm  on the inside and sitting in a disgustingly sweet base that had the consistency and taste of Chef Boyardee sauce from the 70's early 80's. Yet our server swore this was the best. What a bold lie as I completely disagree these are clearly the worst thing you could order from here, those are my thoughts.  Other dishes were Ok. But again not great. I really feel the problem here are the cooks. My company ordered the pineapple chicken & shrimp dish which certainly sounds and looks tasty however something was just off tasting with a hint of spoilage in the dish.  My Seared Tuna dish was fresh and tasty so no complaints on this.  Tex-Mex egg rolls while fried hot sat in grease a bit too long, never experienced this before at any other location. Yuck. The cocktails were a standout among the menu as well as the Cheesecake variations which remain awesome. Your never going wrong with any of these.  The promised 2 hour parking validation that goes awry and never really comes to fruition since  they harbor a faulty system and take no responsibility after having a detailed conservation with management all to no avail but for management to place blame on the parking facility for Queens center mall really left me disgusted! Management advises me to walk the entire length of the mall to get my parking validated for the 2 hour limit for having dined there because their card readers obviously aren't working properly after I had to return to advise them that the parking ticket isn't reflecting the validation.  How lame is that!  Truly the food wasn't cooked right, the servers aren't that great, management lacks resolution talent and the overall end result will leave you sorry for having come here. Best bet is to head out to Old Country Road in LI or any other location throughout the Tri-State area where you'll be completely satisfied and thoroughly pleased on every level for the parking, seating, service, quality of food and departure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-elmhurst,2.24,2.42,2.672,2.54,2.348

But today on 5/23/15 I walked out after finding myself arguing with the most incompetent server I have ever met . My friend and I walked in 40 minutes before closing time so we ordered pretty quickly. Appetizer was served along with my drink (skinny mojito) . Now This mojito had to be the sweetest mojito I've ever had in my life . I'm talking unbearably sweet. So i stopped our server and expressed to him that it was too sweet and jokingly added that it was like there is no alcohol in it . To which he replies well if I change it it's not like they are going to put more alcohol . I can get you a shot and you can pour it in yourself . Well after hearing that response my friend was irked Because  never have we heard such a ridiculous thing . My friend lifts up my drink looked him in the eye and said ""bring her a new drink "" That is what any experienced waiter working in decent place would know to do . Never in my life has someone suggested a shot of alcohol . They always take the drink and bring it back tasting like it won't give me diabetes. So what does the waiter do ? Brings me back the drink with the shot of alcohol ! I look at him and tell him that I am not a bartender and that usually i don't sit there and pour a shot to fix my drink . This guy tone of voice goes ten octaves higher while waving his hands as he speaks saying that ""clearly I dont understand that they won't add more alcohol to my drink unless I'm charged for it "" He clearly didn't understand how badly I wanted to throw the drink in his face for the way he was talking to me . At this point we are going back and forth Arguing to which he says I'm walking away . So In return i put on my coat and also walked away and left . And I promise I won't ever be back to this Cheesecake Factory . Unless they hire servers that know what it's like to make every dining experience a pleasant one. I've never been so annoyed and dissatisfied with a server the way I was with this man . Over a drink ? How can the Cheesecake Factory employ people with such poor communication skills and overall rude behavior ? I know I could've alerted management but frankly walking away was all the energy I had left in me for that day . I'm glad I didn't stay.

186,Linda B.,"Bronx, NY",193,14,3.0,5.0,2017-05-29,"I was super shocked and disappointed to say the least when I read The Cheesecake Factory got two and a half stars on average, but I take reviews with a grain of salt, and I am so glad I did. I had to write my review today. I had a FIVE STAR experience! This location is the newest of the chain, and so beautiful and spacious. My best friend and I went for my post birthday lunch earlier today when I told her The Cheesecake Factory had opened in Elmhurst a few months ago. This was a big deal for many who enjoy The Cheesecake Factory, but there aren't any locations near where we live, until now! HOORAY!!! We reached about 12:15pm, and were greeted very friendly and were seated right away, They  have an enclosed outside portion and that was NICE!! I was so excited as we  got to see outside. Our server was Lajae C. and she was very pretty and awesome, and attentive to being our server.  She highly recommended the grilled Salmon with the mashed potatoes and broccoli, and I love salmon, but what a menu, it was so hard to decide on what to eat, it looked all good. I liked the fact the menus were smaller in size than a few years ago when I last ate at The Cheesecake Factory, and so many choices to choose from. They also have Gluten Free options. Server after server were passing by with huge platters for other guests. You couldn't help but stare and ask what is that?? I decided on the salmon, and my friend had this massively huge burrito which was delicious! My salmon did not disappoint, it was cooked very well, tasted as good as the salmon I had when I was visiting the Dominican Republic last month. My mashed potatoes were nicely seasoned and flavorful. The broccoli was also nicely steamed, firm and tasty. The description on the menu didn't do the sides justice. I wish I took photos, but I will next time. Their tea selection was also impressive. I had the chamomile Lemon tea and she also let me take another tea, the Orange and black tea flavor. I also had the strawberry lemonade that was SWEET and delicious, I had to water it down a few times, but was able to share with my friend. There was sugar on the rim also which was a cool touch!  Then dessert time came, my friend didn't have dessert because she was full with the amazing burrito and had some to take home too! But I had to have a cheesecake, move over delicious salmon in my tummy!! Lajae recommended the Dream Oreo Supreme, but I wanted to take a look at  my other options since I haven't had their cheesecake in a long time, and OMG, OH BOY, they all looked decadent! I chose the Dream Oreo cheesecake and it was to LIVE for!!!! They have actually whole Oreo cookies inside of the cheesecake layer. Is your mouth salivating yet? Lol!! It was so yummy, and they even put Oreo pieces in the whipped cream and a giant Oreo on the side. I had ordered it to go, but had to have some while I was there. Boy that was GOOD! They even have a Happy Hour, so I got to go back and check it out.  I was very pleased with our experience! and recommend this location. Yes, this is The Cheesecake Factory, so you should expect a wait to be seated, we didn't have that today, but this location is worth the wait. Would you eat a restaurant that was empty and only sound you hear is the sound of crickets? Seriously? I would definitely and absolutely go back to The Cheesecake Factory in Elmhurst to try the other dishes. The prices are reasonable and the value you get with the food and large portions are fantastic. The ambiance was great. I really enjoyed sitting in the outer space as it was not as boisterous as inside, and they have a cool window that actually tilt open to let the air in, but that's expected when you have happy guests eating delicious food. That's awesome Feng Shui in my book, and I should know, I am a Feng Shui Expert (wink wink, shameless plug!). Thank you Lajae, I hope to have you as my server again, and keep up the great work! Thank you The Cheesecake Factory for a wonderful meal and time with my friend, you have a grateful customer and fan. God bless!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-elmhurst?start=180,2.56,2.44,2.616,2.9640000000000004,2.488
180,Simmone L.,"ASTORIA, NY",7,7,5.0,1.0,2017-05-29,"I ordered the SALMON and instead I got served SALMONELLA. I went to The Cheesecake Factory for the FIRST and LAST time today, at this specific location and I ended leaving LIVID. I came to this establishment in which I ordered the ""The Herb Crusted Salmon"". I expected my entree to be FULLY COOKED but to my SURPRISE, my entree WASN'T even FULLY COOKED. First and foremost if it wasn't for ME being as attentive to my food and being an individual who actually picks through their food when they go out to eat, I wouldn't had caught this DANGEROUS problem with my food. Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should a customer be served  RAW/RARE/ UNDERCOOKED food especially POULTRY & FISH. I came to this establishment ordering and expecting FULLY COOKED SALMON not SASHIMI. I understand that sometimes people make mistakes but seriously NOT THROUGHLY cooking SALMON is RIDICULOUS and a very DANGEROUS mistake to make indeed. Imagine the HELL I would've been going through within 24-48 hours because of someone's careless mistakes. Possibly could've ended up in the ER for food poisoning and I already suffer from a gastrointestinal disease. Consuming improperly handled food with my disease can make me 10 times sicker then the average person if I would've consumed it. This is the EXACT reason why I pick through and I am attentive with my food. Even the waiter the agreed that the Salmon wasn't ""COOKED"".  Salmon isn't even all that difficult to cook, also chefs should be THROUGHLY inspecting the food that is being prepared before putting it up to the pass to give to the server for the guest. Although the waiter did give me the option to re-fire the entree I refused because for one it's salmon, it shouldn't have to be re-fired it's not a steak that wasn't cooked correctly and also if you couldn't cook correctly the FIRST TIME how can I expect you to cook it correctly the second time. I CAN'T TRUST THAT. Moving forward I will NOT be returning to this ESTABLISHMENT.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-elmhurst?start=180,2.4,2.44,2.608,2.5320000000000005,2.424
2,Joanna T.,"New York, NY",4,33,1316.0,1.0,2017-05-29,"This place is a nightmare. Everything that you hope a restaurant isn't, is Cheesecake Factory. I'm not sure if the other locations are this bad, but the service here was horrible enough our party had to leave after we were seated. I could not imagine food tasting anything near okay with such horrid service. We definitely lost our appetite.  We waited less than 30 min for a table for 4 people on a holiday Monday night, which isn't bad...except the servers here aren't servers at all. The only thing they know how to do is walk around with an apron pretending to be busy. They don't greet, are either rude or expressionless, do not ask if they can bring you anything, avoid eye contact, etc. The people up front that hand out buzzers and walk you to your table at least acknowledge that you exist.  Our server brought us bread after 15 min... no knives, no water, just walked away ignoring us. We had one person on the way about to walk in and our server almost kicked us out for not having everyone there. Honestly wanted to avoid this location when I saw that it was rated less than 2 stars, but I wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt. Bad idea. Will not be coming back here, ever. Going to any fast food place in the qcm food court is better than this Cheesecake Factory. We went to red lobster instead and everything was amazing as always. My advice would be to avoid Cheesecake Factory altogether and just go to Red lobster. They never disappoint. I ended up tipping our waiter there a very generous amount.

First when I entered an employee in the front was not friendly, when I approached her to ask her where do I go to get a table for 3, she seemed busy in a computer and she just responded quickly without any eye contact or smile, ""just go up ahead to the lady"". Up ahead obviously wasn't enough detail since I had to ask another employee passing by where can I register for a table for 3 and he pointed to the direction we should go.  Finally when I was attended they ask for my name and give you a small rectangle device that vibrates and flashes red lights when your table is ready. I was able to wander inside the mall but only through that first floor and up to jcpenny since the connection of that device only reaches that far. They said that I would wait approximately 30 minutes but I just waited about 15 minutes.

We expected the off-peak time would be less crowded but either everyone else thought that too or the lull between services doesn't exist at this Cheesecake Factory.  Being that the nostalgia of eating at other Cheesecake Factory locations in my college years overcame my normal sane conclusion of not waiting for over an hour for a table, I decided to walk around the mall for an hour before coming back to the restaurant to wait 20 more minutes. I felt a bit bad for the staff bc it seemed there was nothing they could do to alleviate the wait time, and as wait times progressed you could see impatience creeping into the faces of customers in line, reflected in the furtive hungry glances directed toward the host station.  Once we were seated the service was friendly and responsive, our waiter greeted us with a smile, explained the menu, and answered our questions. After we received our food, he checked in on us a couple times to ask how we were doing and if we were enjoying our meals. We ordered the jambalaya and a pasta and nibbled on the house bread before both entrees came out after about 20 minutes. The portion sizes were generous however I wasn't feeling any finesse in the flavors or technique. After dinner we didn't have much appetite for cheesecake, and for me the labels of 2000 calorie per slice left me a bit scared of a dessert I may have otherwise indulged in on a less full stomach.

Came back again after a few to ask us how the appetizers were and then we ordered entrees. Everything seemed to be going really well right?... we were completely done with our appetizers, we even asked for a refill on our sodas but as 30mins pass we are wondering where our entrees were. We even joke about Kaz forgetting our orders. Another waitress overheard us and said she would check our meal for us. We then see Kaz running over to us and apologizing because... HE FORGOT TO PUT OUR ORDER IN! At this point we are completely dumbfounded simply because dude you gave us refills on our soda after you took our entree order. It never rang a bell? I'm mostly disappointed that he didn't try to rectify the situation by any means. He just simply asked if we wanted to continue to wait for our meals or get the check. He even said do you want to order cheesecake, if not with me you can order in the front. OH WAIT! It's not free? At least give us something to show us that our time spent patiently waiting didn't go to complete waste. But a las, we are just another table to be forgotten as soon as the bus boy wipes down.

51,Kat R.,"Kew Gardens, Queens, NY",68,249,188.0,1.0,2017-06-16,"DO NOT go to this cheesecake factory. This is the WORST one I've ever been to. Just my luck and what I get for being lazy & settling for the closest place to eat.  But since I've been to several Cheesecake factories, I didn't think it would be bad. Where do I start?? We ordered Hibachi hangar steak with onions & shiitake mushrooms,  with wasabi mashed potatoes, & tempura asparagus, and Carbonara pasta. I'm so glad we passed on apps and just stuck with the bread.  The only positive was the fact that they did give two mini loaves of the brown bread that I do like.  First of all we asked for water she brought the water out and didn't even provide straws. I looked over at other tables and noticed they didn't have any straws either. So we didn't bother asking for any.  But I'm a little OCD and I don't usually like putting my mouth on the glasses. Ok fine I dealt with it.  But we drank our water, and after she took our order we weren't able to flag her down for more water.  It wasn't crowded in there, waitresses need to be a little more attentive- like look over and see if the glasses need refilling. Moving on from the water situation- our food took forever to come out & I get the fact that it's steak and needs to cook to order, however, if that's the case then when it comes out it should be piping hot,  no? OH my freaking goodness! It was cold and my steak was purple!!! I asked for it medium. I specifically told her I want it pink inside. The mushrooms and onions were a joke.  I had a huge piece of onion skin in my dish. The mashed potatoes were cold, with huge chunks of grey potatoes, so cold that the butter they put on top would barely melt & wasabi??? What wasabi?? There wasn't even a hint.  My asparagus was cut into little pieces.  On to the carbonara, it was super watery.. & I know that when you make pasta you usually have to put it into a sautee pan with some pasta water and sauce to coat the pasta well.  Obviously they added too much pasta water in the process. Now on to the service. The black girl with the platinum blonde shoulder length curly hair was the waitress who started us out (sorry not to offend anyone, I just forgot her name and if someone from the restaurant reads this I want them to know who she is) she practically dropped the plates of food down onto the table, she never checked on us except right when she walked away after ""dropping"" our plates off literally 3 seconds later.  She didn't refill water, nothing!!  We then were told by another girl while talking over her back that she was going to be taking over. We never saw her again. Again, it wasn't that crowded. We had to flag down blonde girl to ask for water and then after another long while flag her down again to ask for the check because the other girl who was supposedly taking over never came to us. Finally blonde girl brings the bag and container and practically dropped it into the carbonara. We then flagged down second girl to take the credit card. I was so disgusted. I'll never step foot in that place again. I always get cheesecake to take home. I didn't even do that.  But then again none of the waitresses even asked if we wanted to order desserts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-elmhurst?start=20,2.12,2.38,2.568,2.34,2.276

I had asked Steve if I can actually pick my waitress because boy let me tell you my waitress Sharlynn I think that's how you spell it is an amazing waitress. She's fast quick and very funny. She knows how to speak to her costumers and always came back to the table checking up on us. I had the chicken park with French fries boy was that Yummyy 13.95 for that too was worth it. Also I ordered some nachos they weren't all that but they were still pretty good if they had filled up the nachos it would've been a perfect night. But besides al that I had an amazing time today at the cheesecake and I will be coming back every thursdays just for Sharlynn so please make sure Sharlynn is there ever thursdays:)) best waitress ever,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-elmhurst?start=300,2.44,2.42,2.596,2.7079999999999997,2.428
360,Michelle C.,"Bayside, NY",0,2,,1.0,2017-06-22,"We had a party of 6, got there at 12, and waited over 2 hours to be seated (8:00). Fine. But then the waitresses were giving us a lot of attitude, unattentive, and looked downright annoyed. Took our order half an hour later and we finally got our food at 10:00. I got the Shrimp scampi and Steak combo (22$) and asked for a medium rare. I got three pieces of steak that were the size of chicken nuggets, well done, and three pieces of shrimp with a small scoop of potato mashed in the center of the plate. I'm sorry, but seriously? For $22?? The waitress was still giving attitude after she messed up my order. The manager came by and did nothing. No apology, nothing. I asked for a pasta instead, who which she said ""better late than never"" when she handed it to me. It might as well have been never because that shit was bland as hell, I dumped at least a teaspoon of salt and pepper onto it in order for it to taste like anything. Still, it tasted like flour. The cheesecake is grainy and so mushy it felt like I was eating custard. By the time we left, it was 11. Thanks for making us wait 4 hours for the shittiest meal I have ever had.

Right after we order mom checks the tickets again and realizes our show is at 7pm rather than 8pm.  Cue panic. We suddenly have one less hours. Thank god Tim was our waiter. We explained the situation (having only order moments before) and he hopped to it. We got out right on time. I so appreciate his attention to detail and care in handling our needs. I know how much it must suck to have a table suddenly have very strict time constraints but he was so sweet and wonderful about the whole thing. My only wish is that they made reservations, I called today so mom and I could have a less rushed experience here and apparently seating is on arrival. Maybe it would drop the wait time some of there were reservations available. Also, the steak tacos were INCREDIBLE.

She stepped away for a short break, introduced us to our new server who was also great. Our food came in about 20 minutes and even though we didn't get everything all at once, the manager came over to our table, apologized and reassured us that the rest of our food was coming shortly. Once the rest of our food arrived she came over to check on us. She made a really great comment about how time was passing by so fast and it's most likely because she enjoys her job which is hard to believe on a Friday night at a busy restaurant but she was amazing.

First off, the place looks very nice inside and out. We walked in and said table for 3, she asked my name and when I asked how long is the wait she replied no wait. To me no wait means someone is waiting to seat me, now I know why she asked for my name and oh by the way there was a short wait. The waitress came after about 5 minutes to get our drinks and appetizer order. She seemed very nice and accommodating. Her happiness somewhat makes up for my wait/no wait when we first came in. Drinks and appetizers came. My virgin pina colada could have been better, but it was just ok. My daughter liked her raspberry lemonade and her father just had water, which is hard to mess up. Appetizers, fried calamari and crab puffs, again ok, but tasty. Now to main course, which was the stars of the show, pics below. Everything hot and delicious, thank GOD! I have no complaints on my salmon, and everyone was happy with there food! Lastly, the reason people come.....the cheesecake!!! We had different cheesecakes, different flavors, all what we expected! No pics because we dug in and forgot, lol! It was good though. Overall, pretty decent experience. Unfortunately I have to take a star off for my no wait/wait when we entered and the slightly rude sarcastic waiter that tried to apologize and another star for the waitress Pricilla.

171,Nakeeta W.,"New York, NY",22,96,8.0,2.0,2017-07-05,"So we were looking for something to do during the holiday and decided to stop in to Cheesecake Factory in the Queens Center Mall.  We had never gone there so it was exciting to be in the area.  Lots of families, shopping and smiling faces.  My partner quickly went in to try to get us a seat.  There was a 20 minute wait which is very usual for this entity.  When we get called, we go to the table and the hostess stopped us short, ""oh it hasn't been cleaned...please wait here"" so I waited with my 2 year old itching to get free, standing behind a family of eight(8) who had just been served trying to eat their food. ""look away"" I tell myself....its rude..Anyway - the hostess returns, 3 minutes or so later and says ok - its ready.  So we plop down and wait.  Maybe 5 minutes or so a server appears.  ""hey, has anyone acknowledged your table?"" , we look ""uh- no"" ; he deep sighs ""okay, then ill be your server""  like he was doing us this favor.  We emphatically replied ""OK!"" Im going to cut to the chase with this, story.  He was clearly overworked with too many tables then started calling my partner ""brother"" toward the end...I was thinking ""is this for the tip""  lol  he doesn't have to do all that.   He was truly a NICE guy and good server too (ok fine yes he was also hot looking), but he was also new and the restaurant was busy.  He forgot my flatware, napkin, my babys entrée, my drink, the plates for bread, the bread, to offer dessert..but he got it together.   Its not totally his fault - he didnt have a backing him up.  Ultimately -  Slowly but surely he took care of us  - and even provided a sample of cucumber lemonade.  I will say - in Washington, DC the Wisconsin Avenue location is much bigger and much if not more busy and this has NEVER happened.   Still in all  the absolute worst part of this entire experience was - THE FOOD!  The firecracker  salmon rolls were greasy as I don't know what, they served it with a head of regular cabbage eh....they ran out of fried shrimp so my partner had to figure out some other dish..(we learned this wayy after we put our order in). the mac and cheese I ordered for my baby had no cheese in it.  It had some cheese coating at the bottom of the bowl...I had to stir it up and it was still dry.   I asked for grilled chicken strips on top.  They provided chicken chunks (about 6) in the mac and cheese.  I was not paying for that.  The server didn't argue.  My salmon and asparagus was good, but the mashed potatoes had a piece of potato that wasn't properly boiled inside..My partner had the Jamaican Black Shrimp.  All that money TCF makes and they didn't put large shrimp in this dish? Weird...and cheap.   Did I mention we had to wait an extra five minutes to eat because my babys food wasn't served with ours? Cucumber lemonade tasted (great).  or that the bread ""was in the oven"" and we had to wait.  All the while im thinking - cmon man, at least have the bread ready. During our meal a Hostess came back to seat someone next to us when our neighbors left.  Same thing happened. (table was dirty)  But instead of being ushered off to the side they stood over the table while she wiped the table off onto the floor...again no flatware...nothing......I also noticed  many tables complaining to the manager.  In fact - when  I went to the bathroom I could see in the kitchen someone was wearing a dangling chain preparing food (hows that for unsanitary) I hate to present problems without solutions so I will give my highest recommendation that TCF corporate get in there and retrain the house staff or change the managerial staff completely.  The back and front of the house is a mess.   It is very poorly managed and it shows in daily operations and in the food.  Ultimately degrading the brand so many have come to love.

The wait time is long but you have the luxury of shopping around while you wait. They call you when your table is ready which is really nice. The food is low in average because it lacks flavor. I ordered the lemon garlic shrimp which came out very garlicky and buttery. Maybe the lack of flavor is because It came off the skinny menu.  The shrimp was rubbery.

127,Lashaun B.,"Queens, NY",0,10,3.0,1.0,2017-07-20,"This Cheesecake Factory located in the Queens Center Mall is an embarrassing representation for the franchise. We started with drinks and my fiancé ordered a passion fruit mojito and I ordered the peach Bellini. Both drinks were really good but I liked my fiancé mojito a little more because I could actually taste the alcohol. My fiancé ordered the chicken bellagio which our server, Jordan discouraged him from getting because he said it did didn't have any flavor and recommended the parmesan chicken. I ordered a favorite of mine the chicken stuffed tortillas.   At least 30 minutes had passed and Jordan hadn't checked on us or asked us if we wanted more drinks and we still didn't have our food so my fiancé ask for him to check on it. Jordan brings my chicken stuffed tortillas first then my fiancé chicken Bellagio. My fiancé food looks right but mine looks like it's missing something. I noticed the sweet corn cakes are missing from the plate. I ask our server, Jordan Where are the corn cakes. He looks at me with a confused expression. He said that is what you ordered. I said I know, but it's missing the corn cakes that give the dish that sweet with savory balance. The waiter just kept the dazed and confused look, so I asked him to bring me a menu. He comes back with the menu and starts trying to look through the menu to find it. I told him to give it to me because I know exactly what page it was on. When I turned to the page and pointed to the details of the dish where it list what's in it, the waiter doesn't even look at the menu instead he walks away... yes you read correctly. I point to where it says corn cakes and this guy just walks away. There happens to be another waiter, Tyrone cleaning up a table beside us and I ask him if the chicken stuffed tortillas comes with corn cakes and he said yes it does. Tyrone is the star of this story because he apologized for our bad service even though he wasn't even our waiter. This restaurant doesn't deserve you.  A manager I want to call Jessica comes out and says sorry we don't have any corn cakes would you like something else. Wtf? I wouldn't have ordered this dish if I would have known that. She said I'm sorry I just found out. She said I can give you a minute to think about it. It had taken so long just to get the food I didn't want to wait in that cold restaurant waiting for any more disappointment.  Our waiter, yes that idiot that lacked social grace came to my fiancé and asked if he was keeping his food. That's how it is Jordan,really? First you was recommending food then something goes wrong with my dish and you don't even say I'm sorry the meal wasn't complete or I'm sorry I didn't check on you guys before we got the food or after. The manager comes back out, I tell her I don't want anything just take care of my fiancé meal. The managerJessica by the way is not rude, but she is basic. Basic customer service, basic concern with a lot of basic staff. (She first was just going to offer me cheesecake for my trouble) lol.  We asked Jordan for a box for my fiancé food and this fool actually said I thought you said you didn't want it. Now I'm pissed. We explained the manager comped his meal and I said it's not your concern anyway seeing as you didn't do anything to resolve the situation. He looks at me and says how come, I didn't make the food I just brought it out. I told him that it's not that there was an error that makes him responsible it's because he never admitted there was a mistake, he walked away when I showed him there was something missing and didn't say anything(weird) and he walked around us like I did something wrong even though my meal was wrong. I said in the future instead of trying to give your unsolicited advice on food we should order make sure you learn how to effectively communicate to customers their order will be incomplete and learn strategies in how to best resolve issues when problems arise. At the very least most waiters will say I'm sorry we didn't have what you ordered correct or I apologize that you were disappointed with your meal.. See Jordan, simple. This is by far the WORST Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. From the wait time to get the food, bad management, to incompetent servers, this Cheesecake Factory location is a fail. Also the other manager Katie who describes herself as a second tier manager... yes sweetheart you are definitely second tier. Your sarcastic tone and unfriendly disposition fits quite perfectly in this second tier establishment. Tyrone even though you were not my waiter nor management you showed more professionalism and class than all other parties mentioned above.

But going to this one for the first time since it has been in my neighborhood I was a lil disappointed. More so with the service than the food.  Our server just seemed as so she was a bit overwhelmed. She had a few tables, but nothing that should be out of the ordinary. It seemed as though every time I would ask her for something, you could see it may be a struggle for her to remember. With that being said, she got my appetizer wrong, and although (after I had already started to eat it), I told her and she offered to replace it but I said no b/c the one she gave me was like my second choice..It was the shrimp spring rolls(which were not great don't  get them), and I did the want to have to wait another 20 mins to get another app when my main course was about to come out.  so needless to say I didn't finish them. There were  a few other things she forgot as well or that we had to remind her of and so I felt that she just was overwhelmed.  Then she had to go to break and another waiter was serving us and he was way better than her. I felt bad b/c when she came back I wanted to ask to keep him instead.

You definitely will get your monies worth.  This time we arrived during happy hour, oh what a way to unwind with half price apps and delicious cocktails. I believe happy hour is from 4-7 don't quote me on the exact time. My husband and I were actually hungry so we kept our appetizer basic. We ordered the cheesy garlic bread that was paired with seasoned olive oil and marinara sauce. It had a  perfect crunchy yet chewy texture. We had cocktails as well, the cosmopolitan here is on point so is the mojito. Shout out to whoever is the mixologist.  Following our dishes arrival, my husband had the taco meal that was accompanied by rice and beans.  I had the 4 cheese pasta with chicken and I swapped out the angel hair pasta for linguini. It was not bad it was a mixed linguini, I believe It was a basil mixture.  The staff is attentive and sweet.  We were so full, we opted out of dessert.

Everything is clear after I went there this evening. My friends and I (only 3 of us) ordered beverage ;2 glasses of water and 1 regular lemonade and appetizer first. It took about 15 minutes to get our drinks. I thought I didn't order anything complicated. The food was alright but it used to be better. I knew it was busy for a server who was in charge of a lot of table but at least he should check if we needed anything once in a while. We had to ask for refill even though he walked pass our table so many times (maybe it was too dark). However, they really pissed me off after they served us a dessert which I shared with my friends. Being a server needs to have common sense as well. When you put the plate on the table and saw there was no fork or spoon...how could customers eat it? Thus, I had to ask other server for spoons. He had gone forever and never came back with the spoons. After waiting for a few minutes, I asked another guy. He looked for them at the drawer near the register....unfortunately, it seemed like they ran out so instead of figuring out what to do, he just stood there without doing anything and walked away. Seriously!!! Until our real server came, I asked him for spoons, he looked for them at the same drawer just different level,he found 2 which was alright because only 2 of us shared it.  I was very disappointed how they gave us the service, standard of the taste. Maybe the managers need to rethink how to manage their responsibilities which seemed to be too much for them to handle and didn't look happy enough to work by heart.

My golf buddy is a Cheesecake Factory fan and goes to the one out in White Plains and wanted to try this one. I been here like when it first opened 9 months ago and so much has changed. No lines at all on a Sunday at 12 PM? The place was relatively empty. It was not busy at all and no wait time whatsoever. The hostess sat us in a small table for two and we wanted a booth. She found us another table which was a booth by the entrance to the bathroom. **Tip #1**-Watch out walking towards the bathroom for it is very slippery. Walk slow do not run.  Couple of things happened which is why I gave this place a One star. My friend ordered the Bruleed French Toast which came out hot on the outside but the inside was cold. Was it just reheated or left over from the day before? The waitress was really good and said she will get another one. It took a while for the order to come cause it was being prepared. The other Bruleed French Toast look like it was freshly made and had sprinkled powder. I ordered the French Chicken & Waffles Benedict. There was a piece of hair. I am mortified. Then flagged down the waitress and she was busy with other tables for her area was busy. She looked at me and said it was being prepared. Did not come over from the other table. Guess she coming over when the food was ready to brought over to the table. So I waited till she came over with the French Toast. Informed her about the hair, she went to get the General Manager who apologized that these type of things do happen. Said that they can make another one or I can order something else. I lost my appetite after that and stuck with coffee and water. Even heard plates dropping and stuff smashing at the kitchen which made me think of not getting anything. The waitress came back and asked if I wanted a piece of cake and I said no Thank You. Maybe I watch too much Hell's Kitchen and you would imagine they would check every plate before it goes out to the table. **Tip #2**- Regarding you bill. They will post a suggested tip amount. BEWARE- Read carefully. The Tip is added to the whole bill after taxes. It is not on the food/drink bill alone.  Will not be back again.

41,Marcin G.,"Queens, NY",35,87,305.0,1.0,2017-09-02,"I've said it before and I'll say it again, I love cheesecake. So it's a no brainer that I like The Cheesecake Factory. I've had the pleasure of going to several different Cheesecake Factories now, and for the most part, it's been a pleasant experience overall. However, it's so sad to say, that this specific Cheesecake Factory, one that just opened a few months ago, failed on so many levels.  Upon arriving, we were promptly seated, and IMMEDIATELY approached by the waiter asking if we wanted anything to drink. We didn't even have a chance to put down our phones yet, forget even looking at the menu. We ordered some basic drinks. It took quite some time for the waiter to return with the drinks, at which point we were ready to order. We ordered the Truffle Bacon Grilled Cheeses for appetizer and Fish & Chips / Cuban Sandwich for entree. At some point, the waiter came up to the table, grabbed my half empty lemonade and walked away without saying a word. Came back 10 minutes later with a full cup. Appreciate the service, but why take my unfinished cup, and make me wait 10 minutes without saying a word? The appetizers came out about 20 minutes after placing the order. Nothing special about it, but it was the best part of the meal. About another 30 minutes later, the entrees came out. We asked for new utensils (because the ones provided were not properly cleaned), but the server never returned with ones. The food was disappointing. Barely seasoned, and felt like they were sitting on the counter some time before being brought out, as they felt just warm.  The table next to us wasn't pleased with their experience either. Additionally, when they asked for their check, the waiter brought them an empty check holder, he forgot to put the check in it.  Service was non existent.

299,Michelle P.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,31,1.0,1.0,2017-09-14,"Very disappointed in the dining experience I had while visiting this establishment. I went there with a party of 13 and called ahead of time to find out if a reservation was needed and I was told they did not take reservations and we should be seated rather quickly upon arrival since Wednesday nights around 7pm was not a typical busy night. Imagine my frustration when things went from bad to worse while there. We were told the wait would  be up to 90 minutes as there were not enough seats to accommodate my party. (The restaurant was not packed at all) . I was there to celebrate my son's birthday and we had three smaller kids with us and I did not want to wait that long to be seated so I asked if we could at least be seated next to each other and that request took about 40mins itself. We were given 1 waitress for both tables and she told us any adult beverages would take some time to come out since there was only one bartender making multiple drinks for the entire restaurant.  The first table had such a horrible experience a manager was called since the food never came out in a timely manner the kids fell asleep, the drinks were not delivered to the table, and the service was just slow, they should have at least had two servers tending to a party of that size. Beyond annoyed a manager was requested  who came to the table and gave out false information as to what the delay in the bar and kitchen was just to appease our party because the information we received from someone else was totally different. However, there was one other server not even working with us who came over to assist and after hearing how bad our experience was she spoke to someone who was able to remove a couple of the appetizers from the bill and gave us with three free desserts for our trouble.. As for my second table, two of the orders came out very late and at this point we were just over being there and wanted this experience to be over. We were there for about 3hours just to get mediocre food and subpar service. The busboy was actually very helpful and tried to make the time we spent there as stress free as possible. I don't believe a service of this magnitude warrants a tip however, I think the waitress may have been burnt out and could only do so much with what she was given by management. That being said I still left her a tip only because it's the right thing to do not because I had exceptional service. I doubt I will ever return to this restaurant again unless I  hear there has been major changes in  management and the way the place is run.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-elmhurst?start=280,2.44,2.55,2.436,1.8920000000000003,2.5060000000000002

There was a change with the server half way through our visit. Our waitress' shift was over and we were given this other waiter. He wasn't very nice, but that's beside the point. I've always paid credit, but decided to pay cash this time. I gave a $10 tip even though the total came up to way more than I expected, but I still think he deserved a tip.  When my parents and I got up to leave, the waiter told us to hold on. He counted the money and said the tip should be $22 more than what we gave him... $22 is more than a meal there. It was just ridiculous. He didn't deserve a $32 tip, but he made it seem like it was mandatory.  The 15% suggested tip on the receipt is a suggestion! I don't think I'm going back there anymore.

126,King C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,39.0,1.0,2017-09-30,"I have been to Cheesecake Factory before but this time is the worst by far and last straw. Never again will I want to go to a Cheesecake Factory. 1. Waited a while and no water. Since I was thirsty I asked the waitress again for water. Waitress said will be right back with water then proceeded to take orders for the table next to us, enter the orders, and not show up for a while. 2. The appetizer arrived before the water and drinks. I had to wait another several minutes before water and drinks arrived. Ended waiting for like 20 minutes for water and drinks. That is just ridiculous! 3. Waitress forgot to place our entree orders. Realized it when she came back 10 minutes later to ask what we wanted to order. 4. Overall, long wait for the food. Appetizer came on time then waited over 30 minutes for entrees.  5. Calamari appetizer was kind of good because of the marinara sauce but nothing memorable or worth getting again. 6. Shepherd's pie was very bad in taste and looks. It looked like a dark mess and was appetite ruining to look at. Tasted odd and overly salty. It was more like a marsala. There were burnt bits in it, of I don't know what. Most of it was not finished. 7. Shrimp scampi was 40% good 60% bad. The shrimp was very good, cooked just right, nice crisp, and just right flavoring. The pasta tasted like lemon+sugar and nothing else. Half the pasta was not finished. 8. Gumbo was 50% good. Broth base taste was good and mixed well with the rice. The chicken was overcooked and dry, with most of it left over. The shrimp was also overcooked but edible. Also found burnt charred bits of I don't know what in it. Half of it was left over because no longer had appetite to finish. Really was looking forward to have some cheesecake but not going to happen after the terrible service and food we had.  We arrived at 9:40ish pm, waited about one hour to be seated, and finished about 11:50pm.

39,TylerRose A.,"SUNNYSIDE, NY",29,26,16.0,1.0,2017-09-30,"I'll start by saying the staff was fine. The woman at the desk who took our name and gave us our vibrator thingy was efficient and cordial. But the system for seating people is cluttered and inefficient. She took our pager and told us to wait around the other side of the huge column, which is a convergence of people coming to the door to leave and had us feeling like we were in the way. It's far too loud. My husband and I could not talk without shouting. We're getting old. We don't like to shout at one another to have a simple conversation. It's also way too dim. I almost couldn't read the menu, which seriously needs to be edited. Cut out 150 items and do the other 100 well. Our waiter, while service was slow, was polite and answered my questions about the Blood Orange Martini. The drink was between $12 and $14...but you only got the drink in the glass. You are not served the shaker with another drink and a half, like you get at Applebee's for about the same price. So I laughed and did not get anything more than a soda.  But we never got water. Do they not bring it automatically? Were we supposed to ask for it? We decided to try the truffle bacon cheese sticks. Basically, it's a grilled cheese with bacon that is cut into four strips. I couldn't tell you what the cheese was because it had no flavor. The bacon was the only part of it that did have flavor, though it was toasted nicely. The tomato dipping sauce tasted like straight tomato paste. Not even cooked tomato paste. And it was unseasoned. Tasted like it came directly out of the can with nothing done to it. Some restaurants don't understand that tomato paste needs to be cooked to get rid of that canned paste flavor. I had one stick out of four and a small taste of the tomato paste. I ordered the Carne Asada Steak Medallions, ""Covered with Sauteed Peppers, Onions and Cilantro. Served with Creamy Ranchero Sauce, Fresh Corn and White Rice"" the menu says. Well, the peppers and onions need to go another four or five minutes to begin to be called sauteed. They were warmed but largely still crisp and uncooked. I also found a mushroom slice. So it's a good thing my mother wasn't with us and didn't get that plate, because she's allergic to them. That's careless prep.  My rice was dry as a bone and CRUSTY. The corn was there. It had these salty bits of what I imagine is a queso. The steak itself is underseasoned but the sauce with it had this mysterious heat to it. No real flavor to speak of. Just heat. It went away quickly with a bite of the bread that had been brought at the beginning of the meal. There's always this quandry when you order steak at a place you've never been before. Do I order it medium and hope they go under and I get it rare? Or will they overcook and it comes to me well and I have to send it back? Do I order it rare and maybe they go over to a medium, which I can usually deal with, or will they under and I get it blue? Well, I took the risk. I ordered rare. I got blue.I actually had to get out my phone's flashlight to see just how blue it was. I should have sent it back, but I do enjoy a well-prepared rare/very rare steak sometimes.  I'm now regretting NOT sending it back, as supper has not been sitting well ever since (for either of us). From my entire entree plate, I ate the meat, a couple bites of corn, and one single bite of rice. I almost stopped at Burger King on my way home, but my stomach has been so upset I just came home and popped an antacid. I did tell the waiter about the rice when he picked up my plate. He took $4 off the entree, which I do appreciate. My husband ordered the orange chicken. His rice was also bone dry. The vegetables on his plate were barely past warmed, not much cooked. The chicken itself was not a crisp deep fry. The sauce was not spicy, as the menu describes, and there was this odd flavor on the back end of a bite. Like grated, burnt orange peel. It wasn't very pleasant. Panda Express in the food court does a MUCH better and FAR MORE REASONABLY PRICED orange chicken. They also have much better rice. The table next to us, who had been seated, with alcoholic beverages AND water before us, were brought their entrees after ours, btw, so I hope they weren't upset about that. A very serious suggestion for the restaurant: Make miniature versions of your desserts and offer a ""Flight"" of 3 or 5 flavors, so that customers can have a taste of several desserts. I seriously counted 17 different desserts I wanted to try. If I could get a flight of five and my husband could get a flight of five, that's ten desserts we both could share and try. We settled on the Lemon Meringue Cheesecake. That was seriously the best part of the meal other than the bread at the beginning. The toasted meringue on top was quite tasty. It's not a sickly sweet lemon, but a nice, tart lemon. It was terrific, and the reason our trip gets one star and not a ""wish I could give half a star"" notation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-elmhurst,2.16,2.44,2.436,2.372,2.3280000000000003
33,Marianne W.,"New York, NY",5000,940,15318.0,4.0,2017-10-02,"Time to update my review for Cheesecake Factory. I always said when I die sprinkle my ashes over Cheesecake Factory. I changed my mind. I decided on a Green Burial instead. I'm digressing!  First: Going to Sunday Brunch was on our bucket list for years. I'm certainly glad they decided to offer it on Saturday too. Not that a weekend trip either day to this mall is enjoyable. The train ride is always over an hour these days. That being said, my daughter is happy she can have the brunch menu at Lunchtime. I'll stick with the lunch menu. Brunch is 10-2 Saturday and Sunday now.  Second: Service has greatly improved. We were greeted at the reception by a lovely young lady with a beautiful smile on her face. After quickly being escorted to our table, within minutes our server was at our ready. She also was lovely and smiling in addition to friendly. I finally felt welcome and at home at this location like I had at other locations! I think they finally got the CCF vibe down on their customer service! Third: Food preparation was timely. The food came out hot and portions are huge as always. I am always on the hunt for a decent pancake. Forget CCF on that one. I really wolfed them down. Some bites were light and fluffy while others were thick and heavy. I didn't know it was poor blending of the Ricotta into the batter until my Yelp Friend told me. Oh well. I'm not lowering my stars this review because I was the one that made poor food and drink choices this visit!  I'll know better next time! My daughter was really pleased with her meal. Naturally she had enough to take half home. She has self control that I lack!! She had Chicken and Waffles. She said the Chicken and the Waffles has a very nice taste. The potatoes were just the way she likes them. Drinks rated poor on my daughter's side. She didn't like her ice tea. She said it was weak. I made another poor choice. I had a Strawberry Smoothie. I thought I had gotten it before. I may have had a Strawberry Frozen Daiquiri without liquor. This smoothie was more like having desert. Very filling. I couldn't get cheesecake after that. I wasn't in the mood to take it home. Maybe if my daughter had split her piece. Fat chance!  Finally: They do have good perks some times. We had a coupon from our last visit good for a free piece of cheesecake when you spend $30. My daughter wanted to try what I had last visit. She got Coffee and Cream Chocolate Supreme to go. With her will power she'll eat it a little every day all week. I need to learn to be that good!  Conclusion and recommendations: They are getting their act together at this CCF location. The food preparation is still hit or miss. I've missed out two out of three meals so far. Remember my burnt Cuban Sandwich? I'm going to keep going. Maybe no more frequently than once a month. Preferably on a weekday for lunch!  If you're as big a fan of their cheesecake as I am, you will enjoy. I'm really there for the cheesecake!  And a word of warning: Don't look at the calories on the different cheesecake flavors. Forget any of the regular menu items calories too for that matter! I may stick with the Skinnylicious Menu now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-elmhurst,2.28,2.47,2.448,2.7359999999999998,2.394

My experience at this location is a disgrace for this franchise and management seriously needs to step in and observe and record whats is happening at this location and take notes and get rid of the cancer.

After waiting 8min in person and the 15 min time on my phone while being on the phone i finally was helped and the phone call was ignored i then asked does anyone answer the phone and take orders. By the way it was 10pm and empty and plenty of workers were just standing around. Lets be honest its writing down a order not preparing the meal or packaging it.

Ended up chewing a lot more then necessary until I realized I'm not chewing on food. (Look at the pic) I told the waitress, she was the bomb btw. She called the manager and the manager said do you want to to get you another appetizer? So I said no. And then she just walked away. She didn't even apologize, she didn't even make us want to stay or come back. She had red or burgundy hair and she was white. Maybe if we were white she would of paid for attention to us. I am not the one to post reviews talking doo doo but I had to because she was such a inconsiderate unprofessional ""manager""? The waitress that took care of us deserves to be manager more then her to be honest. From this experience I will NEVER come back.

Our tummies got filled up pretty quick from that. Our entrees were fettuccini alfredo with chicken lunch special and truffle-honey chicken. Loved my pasta. We couldn't finish the rest of the food- having two appetizers is very filling. We took the rest to go. I ordered a vanilla bean cheesecake to go with whipped cream. So good.

Our server Christy was very helpful guiding us with the overwhelming large menu. I had mentioned I was trying to eat Gluten Free as much as possible in the beginning of our dining experience (not intolerant just trying a new diet). The grilled salmon recommended by her was to die for. At the end I was impressed with her memory and presenting both the Gluten free Godiva and Coffee and Cream cheesecakes as options for me on my new diet so I didnt feel so left out next to my husband's Keylime!! My husband enjoyed the Habachi steak, recommended as her favorite dish on the menu, and he said that may have been the best meal of his life!

We had to wait an hour, but we just wandered around the mall for a bit before coming back.  Pretty standard cheesecake factory fare here. The bread was warm and amazing. Beers are ~$7 here. We got the spinach and crab dip, and it was delicious. I ended up getting the truffle honey fried chicken. Very moist and had a great flavor.  The thing that separates this from the other cheesecake factories is the service. I came here twice and both times I was greeted with exceptional kindness.

I settled on the shrimp and sausage pasta, it was very flavorful but the portion was small. There wasn't enough sausage if you ask me. The mojito was ok. My daughter's  pizza seems fine as she didn't complain. Our waiter was ok, refilled drinks without being asked, checked on us once maybe twice.

But let me tell you about those avocado rolls and the tamarind sauce ! As soon as I tasted the sauce I thought I was back in Trinidad eating a Doubles infused with Asian (eggroll) and avocado. We were so impressed we had to thank the waitress for suggesting it.

128,Hajara M.,"Queens, NY",15,1,,1.0,2017-12-08,"I came here for the first time with my husband. Yeah, never again. If you're given a table located semi-outside and not completely in the restaurant, the half-hour wait for your food will be a freezing one. Also, there's no light except the streetlights outside your window. So you're pretty much eating in the dark. That wasn't the worst part of the experience though. Out waiter, Valerie, was insanely rude. Her actions were completely uncalled for. Since it was our first time at the restaurant, my husband and I wanted to try out several things--one of which was the mushroom burger (a friend has been pushing me to try one for months). The menu said nothing about it having beef, so when a mushroom burger containing a beef patty came to our table, as vegetarians, we wanted it sent back. Valerie, with her nasty racist attitude, decides to tell my husband and I that, ""Here in America, mushroom burgers have beef in them."" Um, no, not true at all. You can easily find restaurants where the patty of a mushroom burger is made out of mushroom, which is what we thought we were getting. Even more, not that it should matter, my husband and I were born and raised here in the US, she needs to be fired for her discriminatory behavior. Valerie then lies and says the menu says the mushroom burger has beef so when I ask her to bring the menu over, which she does so fearfully because she knew she was lying, we both see that the menu does not mention a single inkling of meat or beef in its description. Feeling defeated, Valerie says, ""Well what do you want, because you guys already have three other things?"" Is that the way to promote the restaurant you're working for? Rather than asking if there's something else we'd like on the menu, she pretty much told us we do not and should not be ordering more food, as if that's any of her business. I'm never coming back to the Cheesecake Factory. again. And I'll make sure that none of my friends and family members will come to this Cheesecake Factory again until the issue is resolved. I really hope the restaurant owners see this review and have Valerie fired for her nasty attitude, who knows who else she may be discriminating against. Oh yeah, the food? It was mediocre anyway.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-elmhurst?start=120,2.72,2.59,2.488,,2.6420000000000003

20,Liam C.,"New York, NY",175,137,217.0,3.0,2017-12-12,"The thing with the Cheesecake Factory is that they know no matter what, people will still come here, likely myself included although in recent years the crazy wait times has made me steer very clear of coming here.  This location opened last year when I was still living nearby and back then, it wasn't unusual to have 2+ hour wait times for a table for two. These days, things have slowed down a bit but the wait times are often still bizarre.  So why despite everyone's love for chain restaurants, do I want to write a review? It actually came down to one instance. While I feel I've always had a 3/5 star experience (not just this Cheesecake Factory, but every Cheesecake Factory location), given the long wait time, servers in the past forgetting to bring silverware, coming back to tell me multiple times what I ordered is unavailable, etc, I came here recently ahead of my larger party to put my name down for a table and was told 20 minutes despite the restaurant being pretty empty. My party came in soon after through a different door and didn't see me already waiting and asked for a table as well and they were seated immediately. (WHAT?!) I don't understand why I was told to wait by one hostess when another hostess sat the same party immediately. This makes me think that the wait times are often disproportionately exaggerated and you want us to wait just for the sake of waiting. The food is good and the cheesecake is obviously what we all come for, but I'm going to be skeptical of these alleged wait times now for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-elmhurst,2.92,2.62,2.496,,2.74

The server didn't know, but I thought he might be new so I gave him the Chance to ask his coworkers. He never came back. I asked another server if I can finally place my order, she said ok but she never came back. My server finally came to my table and he said salmon comes with mash potatoes and green beans, I said ok. My wine came and the glass was dirty. I didn't say anything, I drunk from a different side. Keep in mind that I work in the business and I know how some things work....yet there are some things that I cannot tolerate. My salmon came (with asparagus, Not green beans), the silverware were disgusting, like they were never washed!!! I asked for new ones, they gave it to me. Food was good.

I am beyond upset with the manager at this establishment. I was seated promptly and then told by the hostess that I ""took a table that wasn't mine"" after she called me, took my buzzer, sat me at the table and distributed the menu to my party. She said there was a party of 7 ahead of me that our table was originally meant for them and I calmly told her I will not get up as this was an error on their part and we are already seated and I'd be happy to discuss this with a manager, thinking that a manager--- you know a well trained staff member in customer service would see this as an opportunity to quickly resolve a small issue. The manager who came up to me did not want to disclose her name to me but she was a woman with dark brown shoulder length hair. She was automatically defensive and condescending telling me that I should have known the table was not mine if my buzzer wasn't vibrating and as soon as I responded with, ""well if that's the case, the fault is on the hostess who is an employee and trained to know the buzzer should have been vibrating when she received it from my hands and proceeded to sit our party at the table."" I didn't even finish my sentence when she literally walked away from me!! Everyone at my table was shocked that this was a ""manager"". The worse part is that this was my birthday dinner (which I somehow managed to tell her before she left me mid-sentence).  The only reason I stayed was because the server was mortified, she came over to our table to apologize on behalf of the managers behavior. She listened to me, told me she didn't really know what to do but she'll bring us some water in the meantime. I appreciated her validation that this was totally crazy. I even asked her to call the manger back so we can finish our conversation and I literally watched her go back and the manager refused to come back to our table. She made our server wait 20 minutes before taking our order but in the mean time our server brought us bread and refilled our drinks as needed. I will say this again, the server ELENA was amazing and if it wasn't for her we would have left with my Birthday dinner completely ruined.  I will be sharing this review on every forum and Cheesecake contact because this ""manager"" who refused to give me her name and tried to refuse me service should not have a job much less a title as a manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-elmhurst,2.72,2.55,2.472,,2.6180000000000003

The service is excellent very friendly staff. To start off they gave us water and 2 different kinds of bread. The whole wheat bread was great. I also had a coke. There were 3 of us so we had 3 appetizers to share. Factory nachos, fried mac n cheese balls and southern fried chicken sliders. So all of the food in general tasted like frozen food. Very greasy too. The mac n cheese was a little too cheesy and I couldn't eat more than half of one piece. The nachos were bad. It tasted very oily and the actual chips were deep fried. Horrible. The southern fried sliders were just okay. Did not come with any sauce and had a bad smell to it which put me off. It tasted ok but smelled like the chicken had been fried in fish oil. Now the cheesecake, Really good, nice chocolate taste and smooth. The graham crackers were great too. The wait time was 35 mins at least. But the staff was very nice and willing to answer my questions. They checked on us a few times too.

Guacamole and chips  3. Factory meatloaf  4. Seared ani tuna Pros:  Beetroot and goat cheese salad was amazing  Cons:  1. Old chips, guacamole was poorly seasoned  2. Meatloaf had sauce that tasted super artificial and was extremely sweet 3. Ani tuna was a complete scam! I got served 5 pieces of see through tuna placed on top of 2 cups of brown rice for $21!!
