302,Jackie E.,"Bothell, WA",0,24,,3.0,2012-01-04,"2.5 stars My brother recently came for a visit from Alaska. There isn't a Cheesecake Factory in Alaska, so he wanted to come here for his last meal. Odd, yes. But it really can't be helped. The boy is a product of America and enjoys chain restaurants and substandard food. Oh, well. I ordered the Blue Cheese BLT Burger. They cooked it to my specifications (medium) and the toppings made it deliciously salty, smoky, and pungent. Yeah, I know pungent isn't a very good descriptive word, but it's bleu cheese...if it's not pungent it probably doesn't taste very good. I also ordered the side salad in place of French fries because I'm about sick of French fries. It was a large salad and came standard with balsamic vinaigrette. The top portion of the salad was pretty good. It was nicely coated with dressing. The bottom portion, however, was drenched in dressing! I couldn't finish it because the overabundance of dressing caused the whole salad to be overwhelmingly tart. I supposed I should have tossed the salad myself before eating? I'd definitely recommend to others that you order your dressing on the side. My brother ordered the Wild Mushroom. He did not enjoy it whatsoever. I kind of felt bad because he had specifically requested the Cheesecake Factory. I didn't try his, as I was consumed with the massive amounts of food on my own plate, but I definitely take his word for it. My family loves them some mushroom burgers. As we had eaten much too much, we had no room for dessert. Didn't matter much to me...I don't like cheesecake. My brother, however, ordered cheesecake to go. He wanted the Oreo cheesecake, but they were out. I know it's the weekend, but that seems like an odd cheesecake to run out of so early in the evening (it was around 6:00PM when we left). He ended up ordering the strawberry cheesecake to go and enjoyed it very much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=300,3.36,3.36,3.36,3.0840000000000005,3.3600000000000003
260,Brenda M.,"Stockton, CA",21,65,20.0,5.0,2012-01-17,"About a month ago, my bf decided to take me to the Cheesecake Factory. The place was packed (I believe it was a Friday), but since we were only a party of 2, we were seated immediately, very much to the other peoples dismay...HA! We were seated and I already knew what I wanted, as I studied the menu online from the night before. The spicy ahi tempura roll was delicioso! Wasn't as spicy as expected, but it had great flavor. The bf got the buffalo wings as expected, and they were huge. I can't say much about the taste considering I was stuffing my face with my appetizer. The entrees came as soon as I was done with my roll and he was maybe 2 wings from being done. For it being packed, we were surprised at how fast it came. I had the pasta carbonara with chicken...huge plate! The chicken was nicely grilled and the pasta was cooked perfectly along with the sauce. He had the filet mignon, done medium. Again...me stuffing the face...didn't have the chance to taste his food. He liked my food however. Dessert...Of course it's the CHEESECAKE FACTORY, who's gonna go there without eating dessert? He did. I? Not so fast there, young lad. I'm not one to eat really sweet things, so the tiramisu cheesecake (coffee cheesecake on top of coffee-soaked ladyfingers, topped with a bavarian cream, dusted with cocoa and chocolate whipped cream) was right up my alley. And I chose the right one because it was so delicious without being overly sweet.  When I went home I realized how the pasta I ordered was on the list of the most fattening pastas in chain restaurants...I thought I was doing good by ordering that but...eh whatever lol....It's still a great place with lots of items on the menu, somewhere that you can take large parties to and everybody will get what they want.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=260,3.52,3.52,3.52,3.3160000000000003,3.5200000000000005

They cater to food allergies.  I'm allergic to shellfish and crustaceans.  I told them in advance, and they HONESTLY told me what I should definitely avoid on the menu and what they could modify to make sure my food didn't have any cross contamination from my offending foods.  2.  They are baby friendly.  I brought my 11 month old son with me and the waiter was super patient with me and my son.  When I ordered my dessert he brought out extra whipped cream for my son to play with and helped me clean it up after his fun mess time with it.  3.  Food is excellent.  I have my favorites, I will not lie.  I have a tendency to order the same dishes, and they still taste the same time after time, which is great consistency to me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=240,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.22,3.5600000000000005

My fathers birthday he recieved a gift card, what a letdown. The restaurant was beautiffully decorated, but the lighting was so dim that we couldn't appreciate it. The only dish we would order again would be the 30th anniversary chocolate cheesecake.The cuban sandwich left a lot to be desired, being cuban, they could benefit from a lesson. Lesson #1 the sandwich should not be saturated with butter, just lightly brushed. The crust of the ""everything pizza"" was satisfactory, but the center was soggy with grease. The BLT salad consisted of an entire head of lettuce, not cut except one slice down the middle, and perched on top was way too much dressing, feta cheese, and the too other main ingredients (bacon and tomato) were few and far between.

Their menu is phenomenal, consisting of everything from seafood to Mexican to Asian to burgers. It's like 20 pages long- no joke. Today, I ordered the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas (corn tortillas with chicken and tomatillo sauce, served with corn cakes, black beans and sour cream). I've had them before and they are scrumptious. My mom ordered a burger which was cooked to perfection. The french fries are mouth-watering. The service always seems to be good and the food is out in no time. The burger was $12 and the tortillas were $14. In the past, I've had the enchiladas (not good), a burger (always juicy), and a combination of their lunch specials (all good). The Lemoncello cake is moist and refreshing and the Kahlua Cheesecake is truly delicious. The cheesecakes themselves don't seem to be that special. The portions at this restaurant are HUGE- so come hungry! Oh and one more thing- I don't know if it's just me, but their tile floors throughout the restaurant are super slippery.

Problem three - the manager. He utterly incapable of running this ship, but compensated his ineptitude and that of his staff, by a well-practiced ""I am so sorry"" speech. He had it down pat, he was sorry for the wait, he was sorry for the dirt, he was sorry for being sorry, he was so sorry that even NOT offered to pay for the drinks (consisting of coke and water) or for deserts, or even one dish.

It surprised us greatly that the reviews for this place were so high! So, we decided to write exactly what this place is about. We visited this restaurant several months ago, more specifically the first week of September 2012. It was not our lucky day. Overall, the food and service was horrible. At the beginning, we ordered sodas and a strawberry lemonade. The young waitress completly forgot about the lemonade. We reminded her in 25 minutes and she finally served it.  We then ordered the most expensive dish--filet minion. The wait time was very long. When we were served the food, it was just the meat-- no side dishes and we were told that it will be a bit longer. Nobody served us the side dish, however, until we reminded them after 20 minutes of waiting. The filet minion we got was horrible: it was very thick and it looks like it was a cheap piece of meat just tenderized like a meat chop and there were a lot of chewy pieces that could hardly be chewed so we couldn't eat  it at all. We were very disapointed and left this restaurant hungry and feeling neglected by our waitress.

Food and drink, pricey, very large selection, and in large quantities.  That's the thing that I have found consistent in my experience.  The food isn't the most top notch thing I've ever had, but it's certainly good.  And they certainly serve quite a lot of it.  There are some foods though I would avoid, such as the fish tacos.  While not a fan of fish in general, this sort of thing was not very pleasant to taste.  I, personally, go for the burgers most of the time.   Typical drink selection, alcohol or not, nothing too special to say here.  A few drinks stand out.  Need to pay for refills, full price if I recall correctly.   Only thing I wonder about in the times we have gone is where does our waiter/waitress go when we want to pay.  Many times, they seem to be right on top with checking on us, asking about food or drinks, and then suddenly drop off the radar once they drop off the checks.   I would like to go again sometime soon and see if my experience would be any different from the past ones.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=260,3.04,3.34,3.34,3.308,3.2200000000000006

To start, the service at this restaurant is terrible. The last time I ate here (and I didn't even really get a chance to eat) it took us 20 minutes to get ASKED what we would like our drinks to be. Really, dude? I could have asked for a water cup from the BK at the other end, gotten water, and been back in my seat before you even asked what I would like to drink. Strike number one. Strike number two would be the fact that I never really knew who our server was until the last 15 minutes of our meal. And that was AFTER the last straw and I spoke with the management. Strike number three would be when I found hair in my food. Not just one hair, but a little tuft if you will. Of course this was after I already started eating (delightful). After waiting 20 minutes to get someone's attention, I finally got so annoyed I asked to speak to a manager. Either it was his first day, or he needs to find a new calling. At first, he only wanted to have my plate re made at no charge. How sweet, but remind me why I would trust your chef to cook my dinner again? When they can't even handle food safely to begin with? NO THANK YOU SIR. I basically had to push him to have my plate covered at their expense. If this would have happened anywhere else (it could have been a fast food chain for all I care) this would not have happened. I'm pretty sure the whole tab would've been covered, with a few freebies.

Four people in our party were there when our name was called. The manager, Ricky, said we would need to have a majority of our party present to be seated. We said the rest of our party were parking their car and would be there in a couple of minutes. Ricky decided to give our table to another party and told us that we would get the next table available.  50 minutes later he was still unable to seat us and gave the next large table to another party.  He was clearly an inexperienced manager who was overwhelmed and did not know how to manage the situation.  His tone became disrespectful and somewhat aggressive when we periodically inquired and registered our frustration.  Ultimately our kids could no longer wait and we decided to go elsewhere.  At our request, Ricky gave both of our families $50 gift cards. That is the one positive thing from the night's experience.  But we would rather have just been seated when it was our turn. We love the food at Cheesecake Factory and will certainly be back.

I use to go to the one at White Flint mall all the time and then they opened one at Tysons and Fair Oaks. Always a great experience at all these locations. Service is great, servers are attentive and provide awesome hospitality. The decor is modern, bright and very unqiue. Love the paintings on the cieling, the high cielings make it look very spacious. The menu is huge, almost like a telephone book, so choosing something can be hard. Also be aware that portions are huge, you'll have plenty to take home and leave stuffed! Some of my favorite items on the menu is -Crusted chicken romano which is a pasta dish with lightly crusted chicken with light tomato sauce -All burgers are fantastic - juicy and flavorful -Pasta carbonara- bacon in pasta? You have my appetite.  -Nachos- huge portion -Fried mac and cheese balls- I don't think I need to explain myself -Monte Cristo- served at brunch, it's not deep fried which doesn't make you feel guilty -Chicken maderia- mushroom maderia sauce, chicken covered in cheese served with a light and whipped mash potatoes  ALL cheesecakes are good..well I haven't tried them all but come on it's cheesecake! My favorite has to the white chocolate macadamia cheesecake and the chris outrageous cheesecake which is a coconut cheesecake (slight obsession with coconut).  A good tip is come on weeknights. Weekends can have a wait anywhere from 45-3 hours. Yes, I've waited 3 hours once.

But the introduction of calorie counts on CF menus was suicide.  You can easily spend all of your 2,000 daily calories on lunch at CF without batting an eye.  Some individual items are by themselves over the 2k calorie mark. This is not including dessert, which obviously is a prominent selling point for them. They make some effort to provide alternatives, but their clear strengths are the most metabolically expensive choices. That said, eating is an optimization problem with at least five variables:  price, taste, ease, health, and environment.  CF is a unique combination of these features, and the fact that they are miserable in one of those factors can be made up if you really value what they do for you in others.  I personally don't often value such intensive inputs, but as with anything, use it when it makes sense.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=180,3.24,3.38,3.38,2.8600000000000003,3.3240000000000007

Soon after, one of my friends showed up and waited another 20 minutes for him to come back.  Finally when he did, she ordered water and waited yet again for it to be brought.  She had to ask him for bread, which is usually the first thing along with the water.  Eventually, after about 30 minutes he asked if we wanted to wait or order.  The food came out quickly enough, but it took an exceedingly long time for him to come back and check on us and we had to flag him down once or twice, so much so that a third person showed up and was there long enough to eat off of our plates while we waited.  We ordered dessert, which came fairly quickly because it is pre-made, but from start to finish it took us a shade under 2 HOURS to eat despite knowing what we wanted when we sat down. We were not ""those"" customers too distracted by our phones to look at the menu to take up his time.  We were actively chatting and waiting, so that is not the reason our service was so incredibly slow.  I know this place is regularly busy, but almost 2 hours for some salads, one entree, an appetizer, and some dessert?  I probably will not come back unless I am morally obligated by occasion or unless I know I will need to have time to kill to get waited on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=120,3.36,3.41,3.41,2.8280000000000003,3.39

She ordered the California omelette, I ordered the lemon-ricotta pancakes and a double espresso, and we both ordered mimosas. She was happy with her omelette. My pancakes were only so-so. I thought the lemon/ricotta flavor would be stronger, but it was pretty mild. And there was the saddest, weakest pile of limp strawberries on top of the pancakes I've ever seen in my life (see photo). However, the mimosa I had included a nice strawberry on the flute rim. Not sure why they didn't use these strawberries on the pancakes. Lame!  The mimosa and espresso with a lemon twist were my favorite parts of the breakfast.

Kids meals are a bit on the pricey side ($6.95 for a cheese quesadilla with no sides), but a drink is included.

She asked if I would like a salad or soup while I waited. I declined and chose to eat my fries while waiting. The manager came by and apologized, but did not offer to comp my meal.

And I like to try them at any place that has them on the menu. Unfortunately Cheesecake Factory, Fair Oaks falls short when it comes to fish tacos.  My tortilla was definitely not fresh, the grilled fish was dry and lacked flavor.  My friend got the tempura fish and said it was equally unremarkable.  The cabbage on the tacos was bland.  Meh!  Super disappointing.  I had to soak my tacos in hot sauce to give them a kick.  Perhaps it's the fact that they have about 500 different food items on the menu but food isn't actually their specialty... It's cheesecake.  And I can say that their cheesecake is banging!  I shared the Khalkha cheesecake with a friend and it was amazing!  Rich, creamy... Awesome crust. Their cheesecake never fails me...

Although it does get packed and you might have to wait 45 minutes for a table, that is something that can't be helped. No matter how busy it is or if the waiter or waitress has been having a bad day it doesn't hinder them from being nice and making sure everything is going well.

114,Kim B.,"Gainesville, VA",34,192,110.0,4.0,2016-01-11,"Sometimes you just have to eat at the Cheesecake Factory- and it's a great excuse to go when you have gift cards to burn there from the holidays.  We haven't been to a CF in years, mostly because we don't tend to eat at chains if we have a choice.  But, I've never had a horrible meal there and who doesn't like their cheesecake!?!!  So we waited 5 mins or so for our table to be sat, which isn't bad, and we were seated in the only quiet area of the restaurant, near the back.   We were greeted quickly by a female server, with short hair, who's name escapes me.  She was quick with us and not extremely personable.  She got our drinks for is and bread almost immediately.  Then she took our orders, and threw me for a loop when she said they were out of turkey for a Renee's special turkey sandwich.  So we ordered everyone else's and our appetizers while I perused the menu again. I decided On a chopped salad and she left.  Then, all of a sudden, we were greeted by the complete opposite of our original server, Jay.  He was friendly, warm and personable.  He immediately put napkins under our drinks because the original server had not, and said that it was shift change and he was taking over.  Talk about a 180!  He was awesome!  Jay was probably one of the most attentive servers we'd ever had in our lives and truly an asset to that company.   We got our food, which was delicious and hugely portioned as Cheesecake Factories tend to always be... Both of my girls wanted chicken fettuccine Alfredo, my husband ordered Chicken Bellagio and I had the chopped salad.  All was great and since we had the gift cards, we were going to get dessert and bring it home!  We told Jay that we wanted to walk around the mall a bit, then take our dessert to go- he suggested we order it now, they'd package it and all we'd have to do is stop by the front to pick it up from the cooler.  We ordered a few pieces, paid for it with our check and kept it by name in the front. 30 mins went by, we were ready to pick it up and I got back and the line was 15 + people deep.  I waited a while and it just wasn't moving.  This saved no time.  None.  After at least 10 mins, I asked two managers at the front desk if they'd be willing to grab by cakes from the cooler since I'd already paid for it.  They didn't seem pleased with the situation at all, and even after I gave them my name, and the exact flavors of cheesecake in the bag, they were still hesitant to give me my things.  They said that my server didn't follow standards, so I feel badly if Jay got in trouble, I don't think he should be.  I just didn't want to wait an hour on line for my freaking dessert.   P.S- the salted caramel, lemon raspberry creme cheese cake and the red velvet were all delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=100,3.48,3.42,3.42,3.408,3.4440000000000004

Decided to put a gift card I received from work into some use on Saturday night.  It was packed--as expected.  The wait for 2 people was 45 minutes.  I was fine with that.  The fiance and I camped out by the cheesecake area and watched them pack up all the dessert and such for a while.  The fiance notice that it has been pasted 45 minutes and told me to check on the status on our table.   When I approached the hostess table, 2 of the hostesses did not address me at all.  It was, I'm assuming, the front end manager, whom addressed me after standing there for a while.  I asked about the status of our table and the female hostess that ignored me said "" yeah we rang for your table."" Well the device didn't light up or vibrate (they gave me a faulty device).  There was no ""sorry for the inconvenience"", just a ""we'll ring you for the next available table""--....okay. Even the manager giggle a little and said ""yeah--they've been there the whole time.""

Was seated and was greeted by Natalie.  She was a speedy server-- definitely got the job done by giving us what we wanted, quickly. She was polite but also didn't look like she liked her job.   Food:  Appetizer: The crab bites weren't worth it-- tasted like mushy.  Entrees:  Filet mignon with mash potatoes and green beans- The filet was tender, the beans were cooked just right (cooked thoroughly but still had its crunch) and was seasoned just right.  Tuna Tataki Salad: The salad had such great flavor with the wasabi vinaigrette.  The fish did taste a little fishy which made me a little hesitant however, if you put a little bit of everything (tuna, greens, avocado and some tomato) in one bite, you would enjoy the dish.

106,Andrew H.,"Centreville, VA",3,11,,3.0,2016-03-05,"First of all the positive aspect of Cheesecake factory: the food is always very well prepared and there are only a few dishes that do not live up to my quality expectations. The kitchen seems to do a good job. Now the less positive aspect... For years the service at Cheesecake factory has been slipping. It's like they stopped caring as soon as they filled up their restaurant. Cheesecake factory has always seemed dirty to me, although due to the low lighting I was never sure why until recently.  My wife and I were eating here for lunch and noticed our table had not been wiped down. It was not big deal we waved down a staff member who was cleaning off tables and asked if he could wipe ours down. He was happy to oblige... with a completely dry towel. I don't know if Cheesecake factory missed the memo but you need to use some sort of liquid perhaps with some soap to actually clean surfaces. As off-putting as that was, it was the highlight of that visit. It's not often questions from your childhood are answered in front of your eyes.  We proceeded to order the enchiladas with flour tortillas instead of corn (yes, they will make this substitution if you ask). After 20-30 minutes we were brought lukewarm tortillas that had been sitting under a heat lamp for 10-15 minutes. If you tell me not to touch the plate because it will burn me, I want to be burned. After we told them our food was cold and we wanted them to remake it, they took it back, put it under the heat lamp for 15 minutes, and re-served it to us. If it was lukewarm after sitting under the heat lamp the first time, it's not going to magically get better being under the heat lamp again. We went to eat at elevation burger. The only reason I'm not giving Cheesecake factory a lower score is because I have had several good experiences at this restaurant. One thing I've noticed is most of the bad experiences occur during lunch time as opposed to dinner time. I don't know if it's just back luck but they seem to be more on point with dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=100,3.32,3.41,3.41,3.404,3.374

96,Lynn F.,"Fairfax, VA",388,253,1769.0,1.0,2016-04-12,"I don't give out only 1 star to restaurants a lot, but honestly, I almost wish I could give it less.  So, we come in for a birthday party for one of my friend's good friend and since they don't take reservations, we had to wait for a table to open up. That wasn't a big deal, except for the fact that if we had 8 people in our group, the waiting time would have been 50 minutes, but with only 7, it was only a 15 minute wait. No offense, but that's kind of ridiculous. I have worked in the restaurant industry and a friend in the group had also worked in the restaurant industry and a difference of only one person in this context really shouldn't have made that much of a difference. I say this because, a) they could have moved two tables closer together, I see them do this all the time, or b) have all 8 people; 4 on each side of the bigger booths that they have in the back. They say this ""isn't allowed"" but I blatantly see this rule broken all the time so that was kind of annoying to deal with. Maybe there was some other reason, but to me, it seemed kind of like just an excuse but who knows.  Anyways, so one of the people in our party decided to leave because they didn't want to have to wait so long. This was unfortunate, but honestly, I almost wish I had just decided to skip as well. This however made the wait time shorter and we were able to sit much sooner than expected. Starting out, I thought it would be a good night! The server came very quick, got us all waters, and bread to start out with and I thought that it was going really well! He gave us a good amount of bread too! The problems only started to arise after we placed our food orders. I wanted to order the Shrimp Summer Rolls but they were out, so I opted for the Ahi Tartare. The other people in my party ordered the Chicken Salad Sandwich, the Parmesan Chicken Sandwich, Medallion Steak (from the skinnylicious menu), the Stuffed Mushrooms and Dynamite Shrimp, someone else ordered the hibachi steak, and finally the 4-cheese Pasta. So, things are going fine, until we wait a good 35-45 minutes for the food. I would have been fine if our waiter had come by and checked on us or at least said something about the long wait, but he kept rushing by and didn't stop to say anything. This, I was not pleased with. I wanted to ask for more water because I had none but it was too hard to flag him down. Yes, being a waiter in the past I know it's very hard at times, but I saw that the waiters seem to all work together and with the bus boys and food runners. I feel like he could easily have asked them to at least refill our waters. It almost seemed like he was avoiding our table, but who knows. I will vouch for him and say that he was very busy!! They put a lot of people in his section and some of the other tables talked and had lots of comments and questions about the menu, so I understand that he was probably overwhelmed. So, when we finally got our food, one of our dishes never came. The Hibachi Steak was accidentally given to another table so one person had to sit and wait while we all ate. They did however take the Hibachi Steak off of our check because they had made a big mistake so that I really respect. It just kind of put a damper on our whole dining experience. For my meal, I was extremely disappointed. I got a 7.50 appetizer and it was tiny! I couldn't believe how small it was. I get that Cheesecake Factory is naturally way overpriced, but to this extent! Even if it had costed 5$ I would have called it skimpy. I was even further disappointed when I noticed that it was mostly just avocado. There was maybe a half of a centimeter of tuna, and the rest of the extremely small circular tartare was the avocado. I will say in its defense, it tasted pretty good. There really wasn't too much seasoning and honestly, if it were just larger, I think it would have been a perfectly fine appetizer, but it was just way too small for it to be even considered an appetizer. The other small plates that I tried from my friend were the Dynamite Shrimp and the Stuffed Mushrooms. Both were really small and their price came out to be 14.50$ (give or take a few cents). That was also ridiculous. Their size was larger though, but still, it was really steep. I will say though, I really liked the taste of the shrimp and the dipping sauce that came with it. The stuffed mushrooms were nothing special and I could have honestly made better ones.  Everyone else seemed to like their meals, but everything was just, okay. Nothing was amazing.  So, our waiter finally comes back after we have finished our meals and he asks if we want anything else and we say we just want the check and that we want it to be split by what each person ordered. He goes and gets it ready for us. This takes a VERY LONG TIME. When we finally get the checks, we return the bills and this takes a very long time as well. Let's just say, we were seated around 8, and finally got out around 10. I will not be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=80,3.68,3.43,3.42,2.9480000000000004,3.5300000000000002

202,Ray W.,"Fairfax, VA",0,1,,1.0,2016-04-28,"I'm not one to complain or even write a negative review, but I was highly disappointed with my service at the Cheesecake Factory tonight. I work in a restaurant, so I understand the struggle of juggling multiple tables and maintaining great service. However, the restaurant was slow  and my server only had one other table, so my service tonight was unacceptable. For the first time in months my boyfriend and I had a night off together from work and school. We decided on the Cheesecake Factory as our date destination. Two minutes after we sat down, our server greeted us and we ordered our drinks. Probably five minutes later she returned with our drinks and we ordered our appetizer and entree at the same time. The appetizer took well over fifteen minutes to come out. Our neighbors had ordered four different appetizers; their appetizers came out within seven minutes. And while the crab and artichoke dip was really good, I didn't quite understand why it took so long. The server didn't apologize for the delay or even bother to tell us it would be a few more minutes. Both my boyfriend and I had finished our drinks and not once did our server stop by to refill them. Our entrees took over twenty minutes to arrive at our table. Finally after our entrees made it to our table, our server noticed our drinks were low. So that was about twenty minutes or so without a drink? Again, our server was missing for another twenty minutes and we awkwardly sat waiting for her to return so we could order dessert. For dessert we ordered strawberry shortcake and Oreo cheesecake. Again, took entirely too long to arrive at our table. After placing our dessert in front of us, the server brought us our check. My boyfriend signed the check and she scurried off with it. The strawberry shortcake looked delicious and was a huge portion.. Just what I needed! However, the shortcake was dry and hard and halfway through my ice cream, I found a chunk of glass in my dessert. Our server didn't stop by to check to see if we needed a box or how we were enjoying it, but instead began on her side work. I probably saw the server a total of four times and when I did, she seemed rushed and annoyed.  The food was good per usual, but ultimately, I am really disappointed with the lack of hospitality of the server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=200,3.72,3.42,3.416,2.8840000000000003,3.5400000000000005

Kinda hard to believe that this is my first time at Cheesecake factory.  I have always heard wonderful things about this chain, but never had an opportunity to try it till now. I would say everything I've heard was very accurate.  The food was SOOO GOOD!!! All the food is full of flavor and for the price you pay you get VERY hardy portions.  We got the summer rolls as well as the avocado egg rolls for an appetizers.  The summer rolls were ok.  They weren't spectacular, but they are very crunchy and pretty decent.  The avocado rolls were extraordinary!!!  Who knew putting avocado in an egg roll and frying it would be so tasty.  The sauce that came with it is like a sweet sauce that kind of reminds me of pico or salsa.  But I don't really know for certain, all I know is it was very tasty. For the entrees we got the Chicken Bellagio as well as the Chicken Madeira.  Both were extraordinary tasty!!!  The Chicken Bellagio is a pasta based entree with two large breaded chicken patties over a nice serving of noodles with a pesto and cream flavored sauce that was very delicious.  They top off the dish with some nice fresh arugula.  The dish was very delicious and everything worked well together and very filling.  The chicken madeira is no joke either, that dish is freakin amazing!!  You get three large chicken patties with mozzarella, sautéed mushrooms and asparagus on top, and they pour an absolutely mouthwateringly delicious dark sauce over the combination.  That combination of the savory meat and freshness of the veggies is an absolutely amazing explosion of flavors in your mouth.  The mashed potatoes were very delicious as well and on the chunkier consistency side.  This dish is a must have! We got two cheese cake for dessert: the mango key lime cheesecake and the reeses peanut butter chocolate cheesecake.  I prefer the reeses peanut butter chocolate cheesecake because I love chocolate and peanut butter.  They mango cheesecake was very delicious as well and very sweet.  I personally think that there is nothing in this world that is too sweet so I could take it.  Great restaurant and I promise you that I will be coming back.  There sandwiches sound really good so I need to make plans to come back and try some of those, and of course have me more of those cheesecake flavors.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=40,3.72,3.49,3.428,3.4440000000000004,3.5820000000000003

The service is typically very stellar and everyone is friendly and efficient.  So, usually I get the same 2 things at Cheesecake but this time we tried something different! I also had a bite of everyone else's food too :) Grilled steak tacos - this comes with 4 mini tacos and a side of rice and beans. The rice is a bit bland and definitely needs some salt and pepper, but the beans were much more savory. The tacos overall surprised me as they had a good amount of both steak and guac on them. Solid 4/5 Crispy chicken sandwich - we got this Korean style which has a coleslaw and a Sriracha mayo on the side. Get this with the sweet potato fries because the sweetness compliments the sandwich well. The chicken is crispy and the brioche bun is soft and sweet. 5/5 Chicken and biscuits - this was my least favorite of all the dishes. It sort of tasted like a deconstructed chicken pot pie but the chicken had a slight overcooked, rubbery quality to it. The biscuit was not bad but nothing I would crave and get again. 2.5/5 Smokehouse burger - this was a solid burger, the bacon was crispy and the onion rings were a nice touch. We got fries as the side for this and they were fine. Burger could have used a *touch* more salt but it was fine. 3/5 Overall, you can always count on going to Cheesecake with a group of friends or your family because the menu is huge and there is really something for everyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=40,3.88,3.54,3.456,3.248,3.676

Although it was lunch time, the place wasn't too packed. I remember when Cheesecake Factory was very popular several years ago, but it seemed like the hype has calmed down a little bit. The bread basket was served prior to our entree, however we only ate the darker (brown) one as the other bread was too chewy and stale. Our server was a friendly older man. My cousin ordered a club sandwich, and I ordered the factory nachos as always. They were both delicious, but I'd say they're not too special compared to other restaurants that serve club sandwiches and nachos. Cheesecake Factory is known to serve great portions, hence the price, however I never taste anything extraordinary in comparison to other American restaurants.

Desserts are okay, which is odd considering cheesecake is their claim to fame. I've just always found their food better than their cheesecakes. Go figure.

The Cobb had a few slivers of thin chicken, but most of it was shredded lettuce that had seen better days.

We went around 330/4pm so no wait and plenty of seating outside (in the shade) and it was the perfect weather for eating outside. My wife and I split the Tuna tar tar - WOW was that good. Fresh seared tuna with avocado and the most delicious sesame soy vinaigrette definitely rocked our socks. I ended up going with the filet medallions and my wife ordered the tuna tataki (tuna with salad). There were 4 little medallions on my plate, I should have ordered something more substantial because 8 bites of meat does not cut it when I'm hungry. I ended up eating some of Hope's tuna to try and fill me up.  We both had a bit room left in our stomachs so of course we had to order cheesecake. Our server Joshua recommended the new cheesecake that was just released (not even on the menu yet), the hazelnut crunch cheesecake, he said it was in his top 5 for cheesecakes...OK we're game. We ordered it and MAN was it rich...very filling and of course cheesecakey. I'm a fan of nutella, so the hazelnut and cheesecake is a win all around.

172,Jon D.,"Fairfax, VA",0,3,,1.0,2016-09-03,"Not a long wait and decent drinks and cocktails. However, that's where the good experience ends. Server was polite but had very little knowledge about their menu items. Generous serving sizes, but the fact is its just waste. They load a plate with grain or pasta and a little meat. So let's get to problems other then portion control. Chicken Marsala was unrecognizable and tasted like buttered noodles with mushrooms and a drop of red wine vinegar as opposed to Marsala wine. Personally it tasted like bland garbage. 18$ worth of garbage. The bang bang shrimp and chicken $19.99 had a few pieces of shrimp and a full quart of rice that tasted two days old in the middle of the plate. I ordered a kids Mac and cheese for my 6 yr old son and when it came he said dad it's disgusting. I tasted it and it was an old soggy noodle with butter no cheese and I'm absolutely sure not even a pinch of salt was added. At this point I informed the server that this was unacceptable he sent over the manager who gave a half assed we're sorry. I asked does anyone even bother to taste the food you serve before it leaves the kitchen to which she responded no. I asked how does anyone including what you claim is a chef know what he is serving daily to customers if nobody even tastes the food. They looked confused. So what your saying is nobody tastes the food that you prepare before it leaves the kitchen and not only is your staff unknowledgeable about the food but there is no quality check to ensure food is made properly. They offered to comp it but that's not my problem. I stated from one chef to another please tell your chef to do his job. I'm pretty sure the sauté cook prepared both the mac n cheese as well as the Marsala. So essentially getting food out of the kitchen is more important then sending edible food for the price. Portion control is ridiculous, quality is below poor and a restaurant that has a staff that is unknowledgeable is unacceptable. I asked the manager and chef to try the food they had just passed off on to me and my family as i stated I wouldn't serve this to a dead person let alone a paying customer. They came back and agreed it was terrible. So that's my point the professionals of your kitchen are okay with allowing garbage to come out of the kitchen and nobody ever thought of actually tasting or ensuring quality control. The plate up looked like a truck stop so apparently the standards of this kitchen are low!! Now that being said I dropped it and paid my bill went home and had to prepare dinner for my son. All around avoid this Cheesecake Factory, it's about quantity without a single effort of quality I'd am surprised they claim they have a chef maybe he never heard of Marsala wine, salt and cheese.  Avoid if you can or unless they get their act together.

Although it seems like there are a lot of ingredients, I would say it was a pretty simple salad. It was definitely more like salad greens with dressing than an actual salad with toppings. Maybe it's because the toppings were mixed in well! When I got the salad, I was honestly a bit frightened because the guac looked old and dull (see pic). It was actually quite tasty though! I asked for no onions and the feta on the side and there was no fuss about this request! It was actually a hefty bit of salad. My mom ate maybe a quarter of it and I still had trouble finishing it all! So portion-wise, they are really not skimping out! I actually quite liked the dressing, but there could've been a little less of it. My mom thought the dressing was a bit spicy though so be careful if you are really sensitive! I couldn't taste any spices really, though. I was pleasantly full at the end of the meal.

However the service leaves much to be desired. Yesterday the server missed a good tip because he never came to our table to check on us. Today the young lady dropped a crab cake as she brought the plate to the table then acted like she didn't want to replace it. Granted the tables are wiped down, everyone doesn't eat off of tables in public. After repeating myself she took the crab cake to the back and it looked like they immediately came back out with the same crab cake on another plate. This theory was almost proven when I asked the other server how the crab cakes are prepared. No way they could've prepared another one that fast. That slip was their fault. The next slip was mine but the server wasn't accommodating. As I was boxing up my daughter's meal, I dropped her meatball. I asked if it was possible to get another meatball and was told they take a long time to make and that the table should be clean. I'm sure they had a child- sized meatball available. Instead of making a big deal out of it, we cut the sides that touched the table.  The final straw was when we paid the check. My husband (the only man at the table) used his card. The server returned and asked if he was the one who paid the check. We didn't make a big deal, we decided we wouldn't be back, nor would we recommend this restaurant to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=140,3.48,3.56,3.44,2.6960000000000006,3.5280000000000005

I am a bit of a food snob when it comes to tartare, but the ahi tuna carpaccio is fantastic! Each time I've sampled it here, the chef's knifework is perfect, slicing the buttery salty-sweet morsels into paperthin slices so that they melt in your mouth.  By far my favorite! I mix the thin wasabi sauce with a bit of cucumber (putting together a bit of each thing on the plate) with the delicate slivers of Sushi-grade Ahi and it all converges for a flavor explosion in my mouth! Amazing.  That dish alone is worth 4 stars.   The only reason I hold back on rating the establishment with 4 stars overall is  The small tables (2 tops) and the high ceilings which cause every clanking dish, kitchen noise, or raccous laughter from the bar to reverberate endlessly.  When portions are generous and plates are large, it can be crowded AND noisy-- not great for chatter with your date or mates.  Despite the visual aesthetics-- interesting fresco decor with mixed Egyptian motif and Greco-Roman style columns, the auditory atmosphere is that of a high school cafeteria making it a touch choice for date night and introverted friends may feel lost in the clamour.  Best for happy hour or with big families who feel comfortable yelling atop the roar to communicate.      The Thai chicken wraps are an amazing appetizer and great to share--just try to get a bigger table as the dish and its accoutrements are too large to Fit comfortably on the small two-tops.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax,3.24,3.48,3.416,3.184,3.384000000000001

Tonight we had a chance to go out, and have only been to Cheesecake Factory once before together (this location as well). It was pretty packed when we got there, and it looked like the wait would be at least an hour. They told us it would be about 15 minutes, and they were spot on. Seating was a little too close together. This was my reason for 4 stars instead of 5. I'd rather not be able to hear the conversations of the guests at the tables on both sides of me, but I guess they have to seat as many people as they can to keep the wait times down. It was a little loud in there, but it was not unbearable. Our server was Veronica B. If I ever get the opportunity to dine here again, I hope she's still there. I used to wait tables (at a far smaller establishment) in my younger years. Veronica was probably the most attentive server I can remember in recent years of dining out - anywhere. Despite it being very busy, she was in point. She greeted us quickly, gave us a few minutes to look over the menu, came back after just the right amount of time had passed. Filled up drinks when she noticed they were getting low (not even low, like halfway). Didn't excessively check on us. Offered to box up our food when she saw we had both put our forks down. I can't say enough good things about her. I hope management gets to read this one. Food was great. I ordered the gumbo, my wife had the Romano chicken. Mine was hot, tasted fresh, very flavorful. Presentation was good. My wife said the Romano was good, came as was described on the menu, was juicy, went well with the pasta. Cheesecake Factory is know for their giant portions, and today was no exception. We shared a slice of the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake for desert at home.

One time I came and ordered the margherita flatbread and it came out with a completely charred, inedible crust, so I sent that back and got another one ten minutes later. My friend also couldn't take out an ingredient from her avocado egg rolls because the waiter shared that a lot of items come pre-made.  All in all, I'd recommend as a nice dinner spot with a group! It gets loud for dinner, so it's not that intimate, but they handle bigger groups pretty well (in my experience).  Lastly, the cheesecake never ever disappoints. It's fun to come here just for dessert sometimes!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax,3.44,3.43,3.424,2.412,3.434

44,A J.,"Centreville, VA",0,52,,1.0,2017-07-06,"I went here for my birthday to grab a nice meal and because I had a craving for spicy pasta. Big mistake. When my friend and I ordered our meals, we informed the waitress it was my birthday. She didn't acknowledge my birthday and replied with ""oh"". I asked her if on your birthday you got a free piece of cheesecake and she promptly said ""no"" but indicated she could talk to the supervisor (she never followed up on this). When the food arrived, I got the pasta and my friend got the burger and fries. My friend noticed that he had been eating meat wrapping paper that they had left on the burger while cooking it. Also not to mention, his fries were stale. When we informed the waitress she then told her supervisor. When the supervisor arrived he explained that they make the burgers daily and the paper was just the packing paper in between the burger. He acted as if it was no big deal that my friend had just eaten paper with his meal. The supervisor offered two free pieces of cake to us, but by this time we had lost our appetites and just wanted to leave. When the waitress came back we said we didn't want any cheesecake and just wanted the check. When the check came, we did notice that they took off the burger from the check. However, not once did the waitress or manager say Happy Birthday when my friend had indicated to them that we were there to celebrate it. Not to mention, when the waitress handed us the check she said that the manager ""recognized"" us from yesterday because we had a problem from the day before. Not knowing what she was talking about, we awkwardly told her it wasn't us, as that was our first time there.

We waited 45 min for our food before a manager came out saying that one of our meals had ""been dropped."" He didn't offer to do anything to ""fix"" the situation, other than saying it would be out soon. I believe they actually forgot to ring in the food because I've been to another CF location where the exact same story was told to someone at the table.  The server never came to talk to us about the ""dropped food"" nor did she ever apologize. Another server from another table actually came to check on us asking if our food had ever come out. He apologized to us despite not even being our server (I wish he had been). Eventually the food came out, but our server never checked to see if it was right. Eventually she came back to take our plates and we had to ask if we could order cheesecake.

There is a wide variety of food that is enjoyed by picky adults and toddlers alike. And of course the cheesecake is always good. Service at this location typically has been efficient and pleasant, and cognizant of families with small children. Based on previous visits, we took an elderly grandparent with us on Sunday, September 3, 2017 . However, that visit was awful in terms of service. It started out ok as we asked to be seated outside and were seated right away. The server took our orders and left. We ordered a kids meal for the toddler and opted to share a number of appetizers. An initial group of appetizers (including crab bites) came first. We finished those and then we waited... and waited... and waited. The server never checked on us and did not once refill our drinks. It took about an hour (seriously) for someone to bring us our other appetizers, which included sliders. The server dropped the food on our table and bolted away before we could ask for refills or even the check in anticipation of an antsy toddler. We had to get up and ask someone to provide us the bill because the server would not come around. Needless to say, we were embarrassed to have taken our elderly grandparent. The food was good but overshadowed by the awful service We had intended on ordering slices of cheesecake to share at the table, but the service took so long that we opted to leave. We quickly paid the bill with a gift card and attempted to purchase cheesecake at the front of the restaurant as we did not want to wait forever for the server to take the order and bring the dessert. This process also was delayed as we could not use the remaining balance on the gift card as the server failed to properly close out the bill. So... they had to track her down and get her to close out the bill so we could use the card.

24,M L.,"Fairfax, VA",4,31,1.0,5.0,2017-10-19,"Giving this restaurant 5 stars primarily due to the amazing service we had tonight. Our waiter, Cameron, served us for a late dinner (around 10pm). Even though it's the end of the day, and everyone was tired and hungry, Cameron was super warm, nice, friendly and very attentive to our needs. He checked on us constantly, but not in an overbearing way. He anticipated our needs, such as an extra plate to share, and extra condiments, before we even had to ask. He was just awesome, which was the singular reason I was compelled to write this review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=40,2.84,3.2,3.336,,3.0560000000000005

31,Leena N.,"Springfield, VA",193,24,14.0,1.0,2017-11-04,"First time at a cheesecake factory and I must say that I had the worst experience. We were made to wait 2 hours after saying it was a 50 minute wait. My pager buzzed and the host said there was a mistake and that the buzzer died and gave us a new pager. We were told that we were the 4th party of 4 and would be seated within the next 10 minutes. This went on for a while. After waiting right next to the hostess stand for another 20 minutes watching parties go by we went to check our status. The hostess confronted us and told us that we were buzzed multiple times and were placed on hold. Her and the other hostess were rude and told us blantently that we were wrong. By all means I understand that the wait time for a resturant is something that cannot be controlled by the host stand but to be that rude is unacceptable. Retraining is highly advised. We asked to speak with the manager. The manager stated that he would make sure that our experience from mow on would be enjoyable and apologized. He also stated that for all the inconvenience he would comp dessert. The meal was less than enjoyable. The bread was cold. Our meals came out at off times. The tuna was rubbery and clearly left in the refrigerator for long periods of time. My bistro shrimp that was supposed to have crispy shrimp (as listed in the descripstion) was soggy and the spaghetti noodles were hard and no flavor. The waitress only checked in on us once at the start of our meal. We weren't even given a moment to try our food. At the end of the meal, even though we were promised dessert, they still charged us for it on our bill. It was definitely not communicated to our server which is also upsetting in itself. After speaking with our waitress, the manager that I had originally spoke to had left for the night without even checking in on our table. I will say that another manager did follow up with our table and did inquire about our night. He was also able to help us with our dessert dilemma. After a disastrous night like that I rather have a burger off the dollar menu at McDonalds. At least their food will be hot, tasty, with good customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=40,2.96,3.17,3.348,,3.086

The food selection is excellent - everyone will find something they like. The cheesecake selection is crazy. There's like 30+ cheesecakes to choose from and an additional dessert menu with even more choices. I really enjoy the decor and service, as well! This time, I went for lunch with some coworkers and it was packed. The waiting time was about 15 minutes and our food took a while to come out. The food itself was very tasty though. if you ever decide to order the burrito, keep in mind that it's HUGE. Our server was very friendly! I just find it kind of strange that with such a large food selection, there's absolutely no soup section. Just a soup of the day.

4,Jayne G.,"Chester, VA",31,87,208.0,4.0,2017-11-17,I have to be honest and say that I debated over giving a 3 star or a 4 star rating (If Yelp had 1/2 stars it would be a 3.5) 3 stars because of the wait. It was loooonnnnggggg. I expect that with a chain restaurant in a mall on a weekend. The problem is they should under promise and over deliver. I would rather be told it will be an hour and a half and get seated after an hour and 15 minutes then to be told an hour and a half and be seated after 2 hours. We were all getting crabby and tired of waiting towards the end there. 4 stars because to food. I have yet to have a bad meal at any Cheesecake factory and this one was no exception. The food was delicious and not just because we were starving ;) They have huge menu and everything is delicious. All four people in my party enjoyed their food. So good job Cheesecake factory - you are about so much more than cheesecake (in fact we were to full to have any!),https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax,3.0,3.17,3.352,,3.102

21,Gerry D.,"Windsor Locks, CT",1,2,,1.0,2017-11-20,Really disappointed in the service.   I am out of town and went there tonight for a nice filet mignonette on my birthday.  I ordered it medium rare and it came back well done.  I just wanted to relax after a long work day and enjoy a good meal but that was not the case.   The waitress said she would get the manager.  I ended up paying for my ice tea and said not to bother because I was leaving.   Not an apology or anything.  It was like she had no clue at the bar area.  I sat at a high top in the bar area.  Last week I tried to order two different meals only to be told they were out with both.  Again I left but at least the waitress apologized several times and said the ice tea was covered.   Really disappointed in the service and will not be returning there.  Will stick to the Marriott at the Fair Oaks Mall for dinner instead.  Clearly much better service,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=40,2.92,3.11,3.336,,3.034
8,Yijun W.,"Vienna, VA",0,3,,2.0,2017-11-26,"I have been to many other Cheesecake Facotory and I always love them, food-wise and service-wise. But I just ordered the worst sandwich I have ever had, a grilled turkey burger, in this place.  The meat tastes weird and the sweet potato fries are stale. Yes, I even made sure with the server that it is turkey. Honestly, right after I ate no more than half of the sandwich, my stomach started to feel bad. The service was not too bad at this location but my previous experience at other locations was much better. I understand that it's holiday season and our server must be very busy. But he didn't check with us once and not even asked if we need a To-Go box. For a moment I thought I was in a small diner. Good thing is my boyfriend likes his steak Diane.

45,Bob G.,"Herndon, VA",3,6,,2.0,2017-11-27,"I normally enjoy The Cheesecake Factory but this particular location has serious flaws. Something must be wrong in the kitchen because food service is very slow (the wait staff is clearly not to blame; they are constantly moving and trying to accommodate the diners while they're waiting for their food), the food is not as good as other locations and they tend to get orders wrong too often.   Why rush to seat people if you can't handle that number of diners?

Update: 11/30/2017 Cheesecake Factory - Thank you so much for your kind response. I was touched. It's truly rare for a business to reach out like that.
