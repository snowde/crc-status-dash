198,Shandi B.,"Davie, FL",70,218,133.0,4.0,2012-01-23,"I might be in the minority, but I love The Cheesecake Factory, especially this location.  I most recently went on a Friday night at 8pm - and there was only a 15 minute wait.  At the Sawgrass or Pembroke Gardens locations, no doubt the wait would have been that plus an hour. As if their menu wasn't big enough, they have also added a couple of new menu types, including small plates and a skinnylicious menu.  It's pretty annoying to have to order the ""skinnylicious grilled chicken"", but it's really good so it's worth the awkward moment.  Last time I opted for the shredded chicken lettuce wraps, which were a really good bargain (three huge and already assembled lettuce wraps for $5). Also, my favorite dessert here is not cheesecake - but strawberry shortcake.  Buttery shortcake, super sweet strawberries, ice cream and their killer whipped cream.  I could just eat that and their sourdough bread and be super happy (albeit super fatty, which is why I don't, haha). Oh oh oh and I almost forgot to mention, last time I went I had to sit in the long bench booth, and next to our table for four was a table for two - except these two were sooooo in love that they just HAD to both sit on the booth side. It looked so uncomfortable, and the waiters had no clue what to do with their dinner plates, since two people don't fit so well on booth side meant for one.  Hilar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=200,2.68,2.68,2.68,3.2800000000000002,2.68

262,Julie T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",272,588,1256.0,4.0,2012-03-02,"Ya ya, I hear ya...It's a silly, fattening, and over priced chain. But during Happy Hour, this place is my friend. To start with, the never-ending free wheat bread is so delicious. The well drinks, some wines and beer are half off in the bar area, and so are some of their appetizers. My boyfriend has gotten the tamale cakes twice and has devoured them.  And you get three cakes for $5-6?! What a deal. He's also ordered the spinach and cheese dip, which was also sinfully decadent. I loved the fish and chips I ordered. The fish was perfectly flaky and flavorful and the outside batter was a great combination of soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. And the fries are always fresh, hot and well seasoned.  I once ordered the vietnamese tacos, and I will never do that again. The buns were so fluffy and nice, but the marinated cucumber and carrot slaw was just badly sauced. The sauce was a horrible flavor so then it just killed the entire dish. On separate occassions I have also ordered the turkey club. It's one of my favorite sandwiches. I substitute the bread for wheat bread and usually take off one slice of the bread because three slices of bread is too much for me. So coming here, you just have to be careful what you order, come at a time the prices are right, and come when it's the least busiest because then the service gets worse and the place gets loud.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=220,2.84,2.84,2.84,3.3120000000000003,2.84
209,Sara M.,"Washington, DC",512,357,36.0,4.0,2012-04-04,"I love Cheesecake Factory! I wonder if their pumpernickel break contains a dose or two of crack.. that's not an accusation.. I'm just wondering is all. I am not going to go deep into content on the Cheesecake factory because all I need to say is that I love their food and the menu is super extensive. The cheesecakes will make you cum. Now, with all of that said, I am knocking down a star at this particular location for two reasons. The first is that their floor is an ice rink. Seriously, do they coat their tiles in vasaline? Baby oil maybe? Whatever the case may be, one step on their tile and you're saying ""holy sh*t I am going to bust my ass!"" And you know what, I am just not a fan of busting my ass, especially if I am sober. Ok CCF? invest in some sandpaper and tape it to the bottom of your wait staff's shoes, that will easily solve the issue. You can thank me later. The second reason for CCF not getting all 5 stars is that the waiter I had last Saturday night was a real douche. I get it that you hate your pathetic life as a 35 year old waiter, but if I am paying for a service, I expect it to be accommodating.

The only negatives I have are: I was pretty much forced to sit in the Bar area after I clearly expressed I wanted a booth in the Main Dinning Room, The wait would have been much longer if I was not right up in the hostess face, and I really had a problem with the fact that they sit the silverware/eating utensils right on the table. I don't like that, I don't know what they sprayed and sometimes they use those rags over and over again, so that was a real turn off for me, I had to end up using ToGo utensils. All in all I would definitely recommend this location to Family and Friends and most likely would be returning. Note: Combination Shrimp Scampi does not come with Pasta, a bit to rich but still very delicious but it only come with large portion size shrimp and sauce.  Hope this helps.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=240,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.3120000000000003,3.0000000000000004

107,Jo W.,"Miami, FL",176,335,1441.0,4.0,2012-09-24,"I like discovering new places but one of the few chain restaurants I actually like going to is The Cheesecake Factory. If you think of chain restaurants a few probably pop up in your mind, but Cheesecake Factory is at the pinnacle in this genre of restaurants. Once you step inside The Cheesecake Factory, you almost forget that this is a chain. The feel of the restaurant is similar to that of a fine dining establish but is obviously at an affordable price. What I love most about The Cheesecake Factory is the staff. If you have even been and I am pretty sure you have, Cheesecake Factory has this huge book that they call a menu. No matter what location I have been to, I swear all the servers know the menu inside and out, and if you can study and remember their menu, you earn my respect. Everyone, from the hosts to the servers, is upbeat and friendly. One of the perks of The Cheesecake Factory is the complimentary bread. You are usually given a sourdough loaf and a wheat loaf. I am not a fan of the sourdough and usually requested just wheat bread. The wheat bread is not what you would typical expect wheat bread to taste like. It is really good when it is fresh out of the oven. My favorite dish at Cheesecake Factory is the Jambalaya Pasta. I'm a spicy addict, so I usually at lots of crushed red pepper to it but even without that, it is delicious. My other favorite is the Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club. This sandwich is good as you know what, but it is also one of the more fattening things on their menu, so whenever I get it I usually only eat half and share, but trust me it is really really good. Another one of my staples is the Strawberry Lemonade. It is definitely good but can be a little too sweet at times. They also have really good cocktails here so while most people come for the cheesecake and the food, you really have to consider trying one of their cocktails.   I wanted to try something new and a little bit healthier, so I decided to get the Ahi Tartare. Although it was among the small plates, considering the large portions at Cheesecake Factory, I thought it would be bigger. It was pretty small but very good. The tuna and avocado were fresh and the Soy-Ginger Sesame Sauce was the perfect complement to the tartare. My only complaint was that I wish it came with more tortilla chips. I was trying to be conservative with my calories this time, but I do recommend the Godiva Chocolate, Oreo Extreme and the Adams Peanut Butter Cup cheesecakes. I am a chocolate and sweets addictive so if you are not into that, these choices are definitely not for you. I am pretty sure everyone has been to a Cheesecake Factory at some point in their life, so my only suggestion would be to experiment. Their menu is so extensive that you should try to taste something new every time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=140,3.24,3.24,3.24,3.184,3.2400000000000007

151,Shane F.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",72,15,,2.0,2012-11-27,"I have eaten at many, many Chessecake locations throughout the U.S.   Cheesecake is known for their large menus and even larger portions and generally I've found the food to be quite good.   This location is no exception when it comes to food.  Service, however, is a different story.  This location is closest to my home and as such I've visited 10-12 times over the past year.   Thinking of all of my visits, I would rate  the service  mediocre at best.  My experiences at their other locations leads me to assume there must be deep rooted cultural problem with management here.   I'm baffled as it is so different from locations I've visited in Boca, Boston, Orlando and even in California.   On my visit last night, the place was fairly empty.  We were a party of three and  were seated right away yet waited nearly 20 minutes for the wait staff to greet us and offer drinks.  We weren't offered any bread until we asked for it which also seem to take awhile to arrive.   The food runner brings one meal over, sits it down on the table and walked away.  She didn't bother to mention when the other meals would be arriving.  The other food did arrive about 3 minutes later.   At no time did our waiter check back with us to inquire about our satisfaction with the food after it arrived.     Overall this experience was mediocre.  Nothing during my visit was so egregious that would cause me to involve the manager onsite, however I remain disappointed because I know Cheesecake generally offers so much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=180,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.9520000000000004,3.3200000000000003

I know Grand Lux is owned by the same people, but Grand Lux is far superior to Cheesecake Factory. First, the menu at Cheesecake Factory just seems contradictory to me. Its a big menu, and yet I feel like the selection sucks. It can be a bit overwhelming. Grand Lux has a large menu as well, but they have much more variation and they have more unique dishes. Second, the food is just sooooooooooo mediocre. Everytime I've eaten there it's been extremely underwhelming. I don't go often at all. The last time I went was a couple weekes ago, and the last time before that must have been 10 years ago, but I always remember never really enjoying it at all. Last time I got the Cali Cheesesteak sandwich and I have to say I can make a better one from the frozen cheesesteak kit at Publix. It wasn't inedible, it was just so meh. The flavor wasn't there at all. It just tasted like unseasoned meat with some melted cheese and peppers. It wasn't indulgent in the slightest bit. I know it's just a Cheesecake Factory and they're not known for their outrageous food, it's just that it's so overpriced for mediocre flavorless food. If I want to get a quick bite to eat at an average place, I don't mind paying a few bucks, but TCF is overpriced for what they give you. The only reason they have 2 stars and not 1 is because their cheesecakes are pretty damn tasty and they make a decent cocktail, thats it. All in all, I would never ever take a friend to The Cheesecake Factory, I'd much rather go to Grand Lux and get a nice sangria, a burger melt and some delicious fried pickles on the side.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=260,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.8560000000000003,3.4000000000000004

Let me first say that the burger was HUGE and the meat was excellent quality. I ordered medium rare and they had no problem serving me it, says something about the beef they buy.

Once my food arrived, I realized that they sent over what seemed to be a box recipe version of macaroni and cheese. I told the waitress that this wan't the one I ordered and even specified that it was the one served in the cast iron pan, topped with bread crumbs. Next thing you know, they brought back what I thought was my side and then discovered that they simply poured the 1st mac 'n cheese into the right cast-iron bowl and drizzled it with shredded cheese. At that point, I was so annoyed that I just waited for the waitress to retire my plate to then complain about my food.  I will stlck to my other Cheesecake Factories from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=180,3.56,3.56,3.56,2.7280000000000006,3.5600000000000005

So we decided to let them see what its all about.  I ordered my usual-chicken and biscuits.  I was ecstatic beyond words because the location in Long Island, NY took it off their menu!! We kept it non-alcoholic since this was our last stop before the airport. The crew had sodas w free refills, and the waitress was so awesome, the glasses were never fully empty each time she took them away & bought us fresh ones. My friend ordered a fried mac & cheese burger, which looked quite interesting. It was a burger w a layer of cheese & a ball of fried mac & cheese on top. If your a burger & cheese lover, this is for you. If not, it might be a cheese overdose & you may end up in the bathroom!! Cheesecake of choice- this time was the dulce de leche.  It was just as delicious & wonderful as all the others Ive had, but tiramisu cheesecake is still my fave, hands down!! Service was excellent. Waitress was great at making recommndations. She told me chicken  & biscuits was her fave as well. She then went on to say that during her first 2 weeks of training, they made the new wait staff taste practically everything on the menu so they can really know the menu when they are assisting customers.  I thought this was insane, but cool. Makes me wanna just apply so I can get ""training!"" Lol!! I would definitely return if Im hanging around Ft. Lauderdale & craving chicken & biscuits or a mean cheesecake.

When we came in there was only one hostess which was another sign because again thats not what I'm accustomed to when going to a CF in Atlanta.

I started my ""20 minute"" wait and was able to speak with several folks that had been there over an hour that was told 40 minutes.  At this point, I just settled in for an hour wait.  I mean it's Christmas Eve at 8:00PM, what else are you going to do?!?

The food (after a 30 minuted wait) was hot and tasted fresh but wasn't worth a 30 minute wait. The atmosphere seemed like most other Cheesecake Factory locations except this place was dirty.  Floors needed a good scrubbing and I am hoping that it was because of the short staff issue.   The menu is totally outrageous.  There are way too many items to read about before making settling on a dish.  It really takes a lot of time to read all the options and decide on something.  I would recommend deciding if you want fish, meat or poultry and then go to those pages and reading those items.

188,Willow N.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,20,5.0,3.0,2014-06-24,"It's all right, sort of. I've recently discovered that the best way to order in this restaurant is from the small bites menu, just get 2 or 3 of them. Otherwise, you're subjected to the usual heavy cheesecake factory fare. Extremely large plates with generally average food, prepared in a generally average manner. Service at this location is usually lacking, which considering that they put each server through a form of boot camp, is quite surprising. I've seen their training materials, you have to know pretty much every ingredient in every dish, so when my glass of coke sits empty for over 20 minutes I'm annoyed. Get an appetizer or small plate, and desert. The cheesecakes are all pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=200,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.7,3.0800000000000005

164,Raul H.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,9,,1.0,2014-07-26,"I had heard many good things about the Cheesecake Factory and I finally decided to try it with my partner. We each ordered different things. I had steak and shrimps and she had chicken alfredo. The first thing when we saw our food we were both thinking something similar: Is this it? Everything our friends and family talked about the Cheesecake Factory, big portions would always pop up in a conversation. The plates were huge, but the portion of the food was rather small. Perhaps what annoyed me the most was not the portion size, but the lack of serving the items that were highlighted by the menu. I only got three small shrimps and 6 tiny pieces of steak. My partner received pasta and alfredo, but where was the chicken? Four small pieces of chicken was all that we counted. The prices for the items were $16 and $20. I think that is way too overpriced, being that the Cheesecake Factory is not a four or five star restaurant. The food was decent. There was some taste to the alfredo, but nothing made it stand out. Steak Diane had no special flavor and the shrimp...too much lemon. I won't be going back to the Cheesecake factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=260,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.5000000000000004,2.92

62,Malia R.,"Dallas, TX",497,673,1405.0,1.0,2014-08-21,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my top 10 fave restaurants. I feel weird even giving one a 1 star review. Tons to choose from, generous portions, reasonable prices, all that cheesecake? How can one not love the place? Fort Lauderdale's location has proven to me that all Cheesecake Factory's are not created equal. On the way there, I call to ask the best place to park, since we are unfamiliar with the area. The woman gives me an address of a place that when we get to, is $10 to park and super far from the restaurant! So we continue driving and find a place on our own, literally across the street for only $5. When we get in, they tell us 30 minute wait..but it ended up being 50 minutes. When the hostess walks us to patio table 238, it's dirty. It looked like the previous party had just left seconds ago! Food plates still there, drinks, yeah. So she tells us to wait and she was going to find someone to clean it. We literally awkwardly stood there by other peoples tables for what seemed like forever. Other servers, bartenders just walked passed us continuously and never said a word. Then I saw what looked like a manager headed our way so I assumed he would take charge. NOPE! It was as if we were invisible. He walked right past us! Of course I chased him down and asked him to fix this already horrible situation and he cleaned it up without ever saying a word to us. We sat and our server Julia D. decided to make an appearance approximately 10 minutes later. We placed our drink order and as she left our table, the next table over flagged her down and asked for something that they had ordered and not gotten. Her response, ""I'm not your server."" Not even an offer to locate their server. We are contemplating leaving at this point, but we make the mistake of staying.  As I'm looking through the menu, stray cats decided to join us. We sat outside, which was a nice setting until we saw the 4 or 5 cats chillin' just outside the restaurant patio door behind the drink station/bar area. And one who looked like he was contemplating jumping on our table. Now I'm an animal lover, but I can't imagine how unsanitary this is.  We finally get our drinks and they're just okay. The Asian pear martini is super sweet! Not my preference. She takes our food order and it literally took an hour to get it. She never checked up on us that entire time, I had to flag her down to request more bread and drink refills for my daughter. I also decided to ask her if I can speak with the manager and she says she will get him. Guess what? He never came!! Our food comes and it's delicious..but everything else was insanely horrible. But of course it would be horrible if the manager is nonexistent and doesn't give a care about anything in this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=100,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.8520000000000003,2.64

100,Wade M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",137,186,3.0,2.0,2014-10-15,"INCONSISTENT - OVERWHELMING MENU - STICKY FLOOR - DUSTY NAPKINS. I live a few blocks away, so my daughter and I have been going to Cheesecake a few times a month for 5 years. We've seen employees come and go. This is my first review. They're doing something right because they're generally full. I don't like the giant menu personally. I'd prefer a few dished from the land, the air, and the sea. I leave it to the chef to pick which ones will delight me most. The service is generally friendly and efficient enough, but they have too-frequent lapses. This week, we arrived to an empty restaurant at 7pm, and still hadn't been served at 8. We left. That's bad service on any planet. I have 2 pet peeves I've entered in the Anything else part of their surveys. 1) The floor is disgusting. It feels like it has a thin coat of Crisco on it. Maybe that's fun for the 10-year-olds pretending to ice skate around, but to me it makes the restaurant seem filthy. 2) The napkins leave my lap covered with white napkin dust. When I remember, I ask for a black napkin, but we put a man on the moon, traveled twice the speed of sound, and correct near blindness with disposable contacts. Do you think you could pick a fabric that I can use to wipe my mouth without shedding napkin dust all over my lap? The food is good enough. The portions are generous. Period. I think I've tried about everything, and nothing is really unique and special, and if there is, it can't be found on the overwhelming menu. I'm not a big dessert eater, so I'm not seduced by the case of delicious-looking cheesecakes (maybe once a year). If you are, you should definitely not go here. The momentary pleasure of a pound of cheesecake doesn't offset the discomfort and long term penalty. Unfortunately, Las Olas doesn't offer many good options, so I'll probably see you there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=140,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.7920000000000007,2.76

We got walked to a booth..second one straight down on the right side of the podium. Sat down and looked at menus and chit chatted...after about 15mins..15..one-five.. i got agitated and stopped a waiter and being annoyed already, I asked "" do we get a server with this table or is it self serve?! We've been waiting for like 15 mins and no one has even introduced themselves.""  He IMMEDIATELY apologizes for the lack of service and, instead of just saying I'll go find her, WHIPS out his notepad and takes our drink AND food orders ( like i said we were sitting there long enough to look through the entire menu uninterrupted!) For me, this is a huge deal because he had enough patience and understanding to defuse the situation, saving the restaurant some money.  We noticed his section was on the other side and he was also completely filled but yet still put in our drink and food order. This SUPERMAN CAPE WEARING SOB'S name was PETER!!! :) Now, lets introduce the other character in this awesome adventure. After another 5mins from Peter taking our order a waitress walks up irritated and introduces herself, Bonqeasha. I shit you not, that was her name, **no pun intended and may have messed up the spelling**.  We politely tell her that another waiter took care of our drink order and food order. She clapped her hands together, said ""OK"" and walked away. Moments later walks back and drops off our drinks without saying a word... Summarizing this..after our food gets dropped off by food runners ( Also amazingly nice and polite) we get another follow up visit from Mr. peter asking if everything is ok and if the food and drink is to our liking. (IT MOST DEFINITELY WAS! Thank you to the chefs that night!!!)  Not once did Bonqeasha check on us. We finally had to call her over for the check. Needless to say PETER got the tip that night...so humble HAD TO FORCE HIM TO TAKE IT!! .but to Bonquesha I'll leave this tip.. a smile and tentativeness is where the money is in this industry.

So we said no big deal, can we sit at the bar and she said  sure. We walked over, grabbed  a table and a waitress  asked, ""is it just the 4 of you?"" And that was the last time anyone  spoke to us. After at least 10 minutes of waiting without  any water, utensils or menus I decided to get up and talk to the hostess. Another  waste of time as she completely  ignored me for 5 minutes. So my next step was ask a bus boy for the manager, Yea that took another 5-10 minutes. Although the manager was apolgetic, he did make excuses for his team, which, in my book, is a big no no. I wasn't rude, mean or angry so no need for excuses, just apologize  & make it up to the customer.  Needless to say, we left.

So we decided to check it out early evening one weeknight recently. Yikes!! I had no idea it would be a mad house on a weeknight and have over an hour wait!! The front desk had young women standing there looking unconcerned and unhelpful. They didn't address us when we walked in, there was a large crowd standing around and I had no idea who was in line, who was waiting, etc. We walked up to the desk and no one looked at us or acknowledged us. ""Hello??"" Finally they looked up silently. ""We need a table?"" She said it would be at least an hour wait. Wow. So because we had driven downtown JUST to eat here we didn't want to make the 45min drive back home so we decided to just wait it out. I ended up going across the street to get a small bite at a dessert shop to tie me over. Once we were seated I started feeling really sick. It might have been the rich dessert bite I had on an empty stomach, but unfortunately by the time our appetizer came I was about ready to pass out. I asked our waiter if we could have our food boxed to go. He was concerned and wanted to make sure we weren't upset over the service. I told him while it was a long wait to get seated and a long wait to get food, we weren't upset over that I simply wasn't feeling great and we were only leaving due to that. He apologized even though he didn't do anything wrong and when he brought our boxed food back out he'd included a free piece of cheesecake ""for your trouble."" Which was VERY nice of him and I thought it was above and beyond customer service. So I'm giving 4 stars due to the great kindness and customer service of our waiter, and leaving off one star due to the unhelpful front desk ladies and the long wait.

I quickly put up my feet and flagged the waitress over who was very kind and called over the manager who politely offered seating inside and assured me there is none inside and when it rains it's normal for these giant roaches to surface. They seated me inside but after seeing 2 large ones outside I had already lost my appetite. Paid 35 for a meal I took couple bites from and left starving.

They also dim the lights too dark to the point where people were using flashlights to look at the menus. Free Bread was cold and hard, but the only positive was that our food was good.

He definitely turned it around for me!  We started with the crab and artichoke dip which was delicious. Very flavorful. We the ordered our meals and James was extremely patient being that the kids weren't 100% sure what they wanted. I ordered the Ribeye with mashed potatoes and was glad I did!!!!! It was medium rare exactly like I like it! It was tender and flavorful, didn't use a drop of A1. Mashed potatoes were delicious with it. My father ordered the steak Diane, medium rare, and he loved it. The fried shrimp platter my daughter ordered was huge, she also enjoyed it. The Cole slaw was honestly one of the best I've had. Yes, I know it's just Coke slaw but I'm a bit of a slaw snob. The little sliders were good and my aunt ordered the steak tacos which she enjoyed with the rice and beans.  The waiter was a sweet heart and brought my father out a scoop of ice cream with a candle, joked and said his gift is to NOT sing him happy birthday. He must have the angelic voice I have ;)  All in all it was a great experience. Loved sitting outside on Las Olas. They lost a star due to the rude host in the front.

Finally we found someone after a non exaggerated 10 minutes who said they would be our service. Note: they didn't say what happened to our server or if we were theirs and they just forgot about us. At this time we still had no water, no menu- nothing. Eventually we were given the items above and were able to get beverages and a few minutes later got to order. I had a simple Buffalo blast appetizer and fries- healthy, right? I am always a fan of anything made with Buffalo sauce and anything fried so in that regard they can't mess up. Our food arrived and our newly granted server stopped to check on us sporadically- I still feel like our person either quit or didn't want to deal with us because you could tell that this girl was not supposed to wait on us. The service was very spotty and we never knew who to go to when we needed something. Long story short it was over an hour and a half spent there on a simple lunch.

Ordered chicken Quesadilla, which was very rich. It was full of melted cheese and delicious with guacamole, sour cream and a salad. And one of their specialty - Eggplant Parmesan- that one was unusual. Looked like a meatloaf covered with cheese, marinara and pasta. The eggplants were cut and breaded, coated with different cheese and marinara sauce. It was served with delicate pesto pasta.  Quite a substantial and nourishing dish.

The pasta was also light as it was just an olive oil sauce with gluten free pasta, eggplant, broccoli, peppers and sundried to tomatoes. It was absolutely delicious. We ended with the Godiva cheesecake and holy hell was that divine. Talk about an amazing meal, and from a chain restaurant!  The only thing that could have used some improvement was speed.

As always the food was good, with a ridiculous size portion (even for lunch), but that was the only good thing about my experience here last week. First of all, it took at least five minutes until someone took the time to acknowledge us and we did not even know this person was our server until later. Not friendly, had to ask what the soup was, and seemed annoyed to be working. After we ordered we had to flag him down again for bread because it was not brought out like usual. During this time, tables around us were beginning to get up. The restaurant was only about half full but there seemed to be dirty tables everywhere with no one to clean them. Once our food came, instead of being brought a new iced tea - mine was taken from me and was gone for at least thee minutes. Took a long time to clear the plates when we were finished and also a long time to get our check and close out. During all this time the dirty tables kept adding up and we felt gross being among so much mess. We finally were able to leave and left the restaurant without a goodbye from any staff member.

That's the group we fell in for this visit. So we figured Las Olas location is a step up from Aventura. Have not been back to this location for 10 years at least. Now that I have Yelp I will be able to refresh my memory on why not to come here when you have many other great choices on Las Olas.  We arrived a little after 10 AM when they open for Sunday Brunch. First we parked at a Public Parking lot one street North. As usual I pay the master meter for 3 hours because I don't need a surprise of a parking ticket. There is a walk through that will get you on Las Olas and cross the street and you have arrived right on the corner. You can't miss it as they all look the same decoration and that peachy color facade.  We asked for a table outside on Las Olas so we could people watch. Mostly homeless begging for money very sad. Anyway the service let's just cut to the chase was lousy as many other reviews will point out. My husband noticed two tables that arrived after us but we were all served at the same time.  So he waited for sugar, cream, and food.  To start I had a Peach Bellini it was ok but considering it was to contain peach liqueur and champagne mine was lacking either. My better half had coffee and he said it was ok.  For brunch I had the Monte Cristo and my husband Eggs Benedict with an order of load potatoes.  He loved the sriracha mayo served with it.  Mine was underwhelming and the hash browns had too much salt.  The unfortunate news is that we only used half the Gift Card so we'll have to come back to use the balance.

I've been to several venues and at different locations, but the experience tends to be the same - long wait, slow service, bland food, and overpriced.  With regards to The Cheesecake Factory on Las Olas, there is outdoor seating adjacent to Las Olas and indoor seating at booths, tables, or the bar area. Yet, there's always a wait. My last experience was poor - we waited about 45 minutes to be seating and, once we were seated at a booth in the bar area, the server took about 10 minutes to greet us since a tap had exploded in the bar (it was loud, messy and chaotic). When we were greeted by the server, she felt flustered, which is understandable, but then that mood created an uninviting and unpleasant experience for our party. Once we ordered, our food was delivered in about 20-30 minutes ... not too bad for the venue being PACKED! But, I couldn't help but notice the table of 4 sitting next to us that still hadn't been served their meals. It was a young family and I could tell the two boys were hungry and were getting anxious... the parents were patient and kind to the server but eventually asked for the manager. I felt sympathetic toward them but it only added to the already unenthused mood I was feeling. The food was filling but not worth the price - I have never thought The Cheesecake Factory was anything to rave about.   Overall - Don't bother with The Cheesecake Factory; rather, try another option that's more original on Las Olas, like Royal Pig, Big City Tavern, or Louie Bossi.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale,2.4,2.68,2.68,2.536,2.568

Only reason why this isn't a one star was because on this occasion I didn't have to wait almost 30 minutes for a table, we were seated immediately.  Where to begin? The food was awful. It was a party of 7 and I'm not exaggerating when I say all of my friends and I got sick; my one friend threw up while he was there because his burger wasn't cooked right!  I ordered a supreme pizza, first off, I never thought anyone could mess up pizza but my god-- my toppings were falling off because it was under cooked! The middle was still doughy and the slices weren't even cut properly. Another friend ordered the four cheese pasta and it came out cold and sweet/sour. Also wouldn't recommend getting the the steak tacos or chicken enchilada, both of my friends resulted in stomach problems that carried onto the night and the next day.  Furthermore, the service- I get it, we were a big group, but our waitress wasn't having it with us last night. Hardly ever came around to refill our drinks, my friend requested a sauce and it didn't come out until after she was almost done with her food and was brought out by ANOTHER waiter, I personally also asked for hot sauce and she flat out ignored me and another waitress grabbed hot sauce for me instead. She also charged my friends and I wrong for some items but we're so fed up we just decided to leave.

The only problem again was customer service. Our server Timothy forgot about drink we have ordered and overall was not really attentive, at the end when he gave us a check he took it right away and opened to see how much tips we left him, I'm sorry it was a little bit awkward, I've worked in the restaurants before and it was a big no no to take signed check from people while they still there and especially to check the tips.

The last two times we went to this location before this experience Shane was our server and he was so great and accommodating as always.  My family and I came in Friday as soon as they opened. Christopher was our server this time, at least that was the name on the server check. My sister ordered a side of angel hair pasta and added the scampi sauce... same thing she orders everyyyy time. He goes ""mm no"" we don't do that and tries to point her to the 20$ dish with mushrooms AND shrimp.... ""No"" is something you should never say to a guest.. Anyway, my sister can't eat shellfish and she hates mushrooms why would you recommend that after being told there's an allergy.  We very very politely let the Chris know that the way that we asked for it has always been accommodated and if anything at all they added an upcharge for the sauce. He double checked with the kitchen manager to see what he could do and he came back to the table and actually told us ""yea my kitchen manager said he won't do that at all actually"".. hmmmm... really? Either they have a brand new kitchen manager then or the server never actually asked. We literally ordered the same exact dish 3 weeks ago for my birthday!! I cannot get over that he actually told us they won't make what she has gotten every single time we have come in. She ended up choosing something totally different. The service aside from that was great, as far as the food coming out and drink refills and what not but the hospitality part and accommodating the guest totally lacked.

20,Jennifer A.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",415,44,60.0,3.0,2017-12-03,"Review update*** In my initial review I had given this location five stars because of prior great experiences. Unfortunately today was not as great so I am updating my review.  We came in today for brunch. And sat outside to enjoy the nice weather and Las Olas view. Our server came over and greeted us, he came back quickly with our first round of drinks and told us he would be right back. Unfortunately, my family and I were left there with our drinks getting watered down and no one came ""right back"" to take our order. It took 20 minutes for someone to come over and that person not being our server but she did take an order for us. After that it took another 35 minutes for our food to come outside. From the time we were sat and received a first round of drinks, the total time before we received our food was almost an hour from beginning to end we spent almost two hours here when all we were expecting to do was have a quick brunch before some holiday shopping.  I do understand that weekends are busy but I do expect more from such a reputable establishment. I work in the food industry and 20 minutes to take an order is not okay and 35 minute ticket times on lunch entrees is a bit ridiculous. Even if someone had come over and checked up on us, told us there was a delay in the kitchen, asked if our drinks were ok (which the first margarita we got wasn't that great) we would have felt better and been more understanding. But it's a terrible feeling to feel that you were looking forward to relaxing and catching up with family but instead we were anxious and hungry and the bad experience consumed the conversation and ruined the entire afternoon.  I did make a manager aware of the situation and he was very nice and polite when he came over so that is appreciated. The food was good as usual but not worth waiting an hour. Next time it may be better to check out the other great brunch places on Las Olas and only come to this location when I have 2 hours to spare on a meal.  _________________ _________ __ Original review* From beginning to end a delightful experience! We started our meal with two appetizers, the fried Mac and cheese and the blue cheese and pear flat bread. I fell in love the the fried mac and the delicious tomato based sauce they came in was fantastic. I also loved the hint of sweetness that the pear adds to the flatbread without overpowering the other flavors. And just when I thought it couldn't get any better the entrees arrived.  I love great presentation and my boyfriend and I both had beautiful photo worthy dishes! He had he Thai Coconut Lime Chicken which was great. One bite wasn't enough, I kept picking off of his plate. I had the Miso Salmon which can be best described in one word, ""wow!"" The dish was bursting with amazing flavor and I couldn't hen enough of  the miso sauce. I asked for more so I could mix it in with my rice, such a great mix. This is definitely my new salmon dish.  We ended our meal with the celebration cheesecake, my daughter was instantly drawn to the fun colors. It tasted just as good as it looked.  The service was just as great as the food. Our server greeted us quickly, was very nice and attentive during the entire time we were there. He was already offering refills as we came close to the bottom of our sodas and was so nice to offer to pack our leftovers so we could have space for dessert. We will be back soon, thanks for a great time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale,3.08,2.79,2.964,,2.9060000000000006

I was staying at a local hotel very close to the Cheesecake Factory and decided to call ahead to order a pickup order. Called around 8pm at night and they said it would be 15-20mins till the food would be ready, not a problem. I arrived about 25 mins after calling to find out the food wasn't ready and it would be another 20-30mins till it was. I was informed they are busy with customers who are seated in the restaurant and they would get to my meal when they could. Excuse me? I'm pretty sure the money I have means and works the same as the money of those seated down inside the restaurant. I waited for my $20 Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken that I ordered. I asked if I could get a slice of cheesecake in addition to the meal and the employee's sarcastic response, ""You know you could have ordered the cheesecake when you ordered your meal but I guess we can just add it on?"" Pardon me, I'm sorry if it's such a huge inconvenience for you to do your job and cut me a slice of cheesecake and take my money. About an hour after I called in my order it was finally ready. Once I got back to my hotel I noticed that there was no bread included in the meal, which there always is, and there were 2, 2 whole pieces of chicken on my entire dish that I paid $20 for!

32,Rey D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",122,28,10.0,1.0,2017-12-26,"Well what can I say, I have given this 2 chances, each time the food was beyond mediocre and not only that, do not follow directions. First off the Sheppards Pie is not a Sheppards Pie, its far from it, lets say its a combination of bad meat and bad veggies served as its a splat on a roof shingle. I've had REAL Sheppards pie, this is a poor substitute for a reinvention beyond awful. My partner ordered a Cobb Salad, well soggy lettuce does not make a salad. We said no egg, no avocados, but it seems the cook felt like adding them anyways. Poor order entry! As a business owner in the food field I know how to take an order, listen to the client and follow through in the kitchen. Granted this place makes its bucks and doesn't not care about reviews but I will still say this place has gone down hill, its typical corp food with no soul. But they keep doing good for people that are clueless on real food.  This place is not what it use to be..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale,2.92,2.76,2.94,,2.824
36,Ben B.,"Wellington, FL",5,8,,1.0,2017-12-30,"After waiting for an hour to be seated we were informed our name was never placed in the list while we had a pager assigned to us.  After 30 more minutes we were seated with dirty silverware, dirty napkins and horrible service. We needed walking out because they never replaced the dirty silverware after TWO requests. The manager did not pay any mind and did not address the issue whatsoever. I have been to many of their franchises but have never been more disgusted than today!  The manager most definitely reflected the service in this establishment.

While looking at the menus, it got darker????? My dinner, eggplant parm, 5 stars.

27,Max T.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,15,,1.0,2018-01-01,"This place is not even busy on New Year's Day, yet we waited for our food to be served for over an hour after seating down.  Then we ordered deserts, one of the orders was missing and the cheese cake was accidentally swapped with the table next to us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale,2.84,2.73,2.92,,2.774
23,Marcelo F.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",168,20,14.0,1.0,2018-01-07,"Hard to believe that such a large restaurant is so unorganized. The problem is always when picking up to-go orders. The person in the to go booth has no way to communicate with the kitchen and has to constantly run back to check on orders while also taking phone calls and tons of clients that keep walking up to the to go desk. They tell you to wait, then your order is brought out and no one tells you anything, so youre sitting waiting for nothing. Also they never have cup holders. Really need to get it together guys! Besides that, most staff is great. So os the food. Maybe management needs to be swapped out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale,2.72,2.7,2.904,,2.708
