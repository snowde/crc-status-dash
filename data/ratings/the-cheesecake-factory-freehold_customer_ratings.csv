They deserve opinions and good (or bad) reviews too.  I've always been a fan of this place... huge portions and cheap prices, and the good is genuinely tasty. Apps, I love the Ahi tuna tartar, the avocado egg rolls, and the southwest chicken egg rolls. For the mains... I must, always must, get the Lousiana Chicken Pasta here.

It's a chain so of course if you have been to one you have been to them all. Anyway, I came here on a Monday night and this place was jam packed! First they gave us a beeper for the wait which I get and it's normal, but when our beeper went off they told us there was a line for people who had already had their beepers go off. So there were two waits which I found a little odd. The first wait was about 20 minutes (what the told us when we walked in) and the second wait was 5 minutes. Service was slow but I can't be mad at the waitress because every seat must have been taken. It took over 10 minutes to get our drinks after ordering them. If you are unfamiliar with the way this place is set up, all of their two seater tables are in a line about a foot away from each other. This was annoying because I was seated next to two very loud women and I could barely hold my own conversation with my friend because they were talking SO LOUD. That put me in a bad mood. I'm also a little irritated because after I had already been waiting about 15 minutes, I heard the hostess tell new people that were coming in that the hi-top tables in the middle were seat yourself and you would get service right away.

(Sorry, bad joke) Honestly, though I am always skeptical of places with too large of a menu but every time I have eaten there everything has been extremely well-prepared and absolutely delicious. They have a fantastic ""Skinnylicious"" menu that enables you to eat well and also calorie-friendly. Sure, there's a wide range of salads but also samosas, tacos, ahi carpaccio, and lots of vegetarian friendly dishes. I'm fond of the shrimp and fresh arugula and endive salad (I don't see endive on menus too often and it's a nice treat if you happen to be a fan of it). One day, I'm going to make it to their Sunday Brunch because I hear they do a fantastic job with the omelettes. During the spring and summer season this is a great place to dine al fresco. The have a huge portico with vaulted ceilings that is softly lit and so comfortable to sit in that you usually wind up staying wayy past dinner has ended. That's ok though - because in addition to the selection of cheesecakes (White chocolate raspberry truffle and Reese's PB pie are my favorites) they also have a full bar with a nice array of specialty cocktails.

191,Melissa H.,"San Diego, United States",19,191,16.0,4.0,2012-07-04,"I am normally not a chain restaurant eating person but since I had never been to a Cheesecake factory before, thought I would give it a try.  The first time we attempted to go, it was a weekend fir dinner and there was a 2.5 hr wait!  The high tables in the bar and the bar seats are first come first serve and not a spot here was clearing anytime soon.  We did not want to wait so we came back a few weeks later on a Sunday at 1pm.  Although there was still a 30 min wait, we were able to get a spot at the bar right away.  The decor is very inviting and warm.  As we looked through the menus, I was overwhelmed by the variety and slightly confused as what kind of food the Cheesecake factory focuses on.  Identity crisis I must say.  I looked thru both the regular menu and the skinny menu.  After hearing how big the portions are and how the calories could really add up here, we sort of kept to the skinny menu.  We were impressed!  I started off with a skinny mojito and hubby ordered a skinny sangria.  What made the mojito ""skinny"" is that they use sweetener vs regular sugar or sugar syrup.  It was refreshing and surprisingly tasted like a normal mojito.  The husband ordered a skinny sangria which he really wasn't raving about.  The skinny in this is that no fruit is added.  From the reg menu, I ordered the lunch miso salmon with a side of sautéed spinach which I paid extra for.  It was delicious and the portion was still sufficient considering it was a lunch item.  I highly recommend the miso salmon.  Hubby ordered 2 items:  ahi carpaccio fr the skinny menu and the tex mex egg rolls fr the reg menu.  Was super impressed with the ahi carpaccio---for the portion size and tastiness, I'm afraid to say this of a chain restaurant, but its the best!  Nothing special about the Tex mex eggrolls---tasty but not any worse or better than other tex mex rolls I've had.  To finish off our Cheesecake factory experience,  I took a look at the dessert display case and the menu and man, the variety of dessert is insane!!!  We ended having the caramel macadamia cheesecake which was very good but probably would choose a different dessert if I ever returned so I could get my nose in something new.

205,Joe S.,"New York, United States",1,15,,2.0,2012-08-14,"Love Cheesecake Factory, but not at this location. I've never experienced such poor service in my life. We sat down about 4:40 and the waiter came right away to bring us water and said he'll give us time to look over the menu and told us we can still get lunch menu for a cheaper price (lunch ends at 5 here) and I wanted the lunch special. About 10 minutes before 5, he came to take our order. We told him we were ready and he said that he'll be right back. What I mean be right back was that he went in and out the kitchen so many times I lost count and even took peoples orders who sat down after us. A couple minutes after 5 he finally came and I asked him if I can syill get lunch and he said that lunch is over. I am not a difficult person trying to look for discounts but in this case this just was not fair just waiting and waiting and him taking of people who came after us when everyone in my party was ready to order. I told him nicely about this and gave me the lunch special. I guess he got offended and never came back to the table once to check on us or ask if we needed anything The next time he came to the table was to drop off the check. Another waiter brought out everyone's food. It was some friends and I so the bread went fast, and we had to ask other waiters and the busboy for more bread. I wanted to tell the manager about my experience, not to look for a free meal on my next visit but so this waiter can get his act together and provide better service to future customers, but I didn't want to bother because I'm out of my friends and old enough to get over this and enjoy the rest of this night. This Cheescake Factory provides the worst service. Other locations provide provide you excellent service.

33,Israel H.,"New York, United States",523,573,165.0,4.0,2012-08-26,"So I found myself coming to another cheesecake factory restaurant, this time with my two middle girls, ages 6.5 and 8. Well as in typical fashion, if your there for a table, you'll need to wait about 15min. Not that bad.. We were seated at a decent booth and Anthony greeted us.  We ordered for the kids and I ordered the firecracker salmon. Well when they delivered the firecracker salmon, I must say.. Compared to All the other Cheesecake factory restaurants I have been to, this dish they served me looked empty.. As though someone ate most of it... See the photo... I will post another photo, when I am in Boston next week. They usually serve it with a very large mound of cabbage in the middle.. I mentioned this to the waiter.. I asked home ""what happened to this dish? Did someone eat from it?"" LOL He seemed concerned... So I explained and he called over the manager. I once again explained.. And expected All Cheesecake factory restaurants to be consistent.. He stated that is how they serve it there always and asked if I wanted something else.  I stated, no I love that stuff and was just surprised at the difference.. Well for anyone that hasn't tasted this dish here.. I think it is heavenly.. The cabbage is a red cabbage that has some tangy spicy Thai type sauce on it.. I love it. You also dip the salmon in it and it great.. My 8yr old had asked to change her order about 10 minutes after she ordered it... And Anthony was very nice about it and swapped it out. When we were done eating, Anthony offered complimentary desert cheesecakes on the house for the three of us in compensation for the disappointment. I must say, they did redeem themselves with their excellent customer service.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-freehold?start=80,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.056,3.5600000000000005

149,Shani H.,"Monroe Township, United States",0,4,,2.0,2012-11-17,"Flies, flies and more flies!  I went for lunch with my husband and three kids.  We were already at the mall, so we figured it was convenient.  I have to say that my husband and I used to go there regularly on our Saturday night date night.  We would find a place at the bar and eat there, since the wait for a table was always at least an hour.  The bartenders were great - they were friendly and fun, and always seemed to remember our favorite drink.  The bar was crowded, but that's ok for a Saturday night.  It was fun!  However.....We stopped going after a disastrous mothers day brunch.  The food was awful - I mean every dish went back.  The manager apologized profusely and tried to make it right.  After two tries with the food (French toast...not a tough one right?  All either burnt or undercooked) we gave up.  When we received our bill, the manager deducted almost everything.  We left the waitress a big tip anyway - she tried. So fast forward... After so many months, we figured we would give it another chance.  Big mistake.  We were seated in a booth along the back of the restaurant that was adjacent to the kitchen.  Since the kitchen is behind a great wall of windows, we can see in, which I usually consider a good thing.  Nothing to hide, right?  Well, this time, the windows were crawling with flies.  Not a few, not several....MANY, MANY flies.  It was repulsive.  My husband noticed it first, and once we all looked, we couldn't stop.  I do not know how that kitchen was functioning with so many flies in there.  Needless to say, none of us really touched our food. The hostesses are very sweet, our server was fine.  Not friendly, not rude.  I don't see any reason to go back.  It is a beautifully decorated space for a chain, and the menu is extremely extensive.  But after two horrendous experiences, we would be better off elsewhere.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-freehold?start=180,3.56,3.56,3.56,2.8240000000000003,3.5600000000000005
170,Max S.,"New York, United States",246,325,100.0,4.0,2012-12-01,"We have all been to The Cheesecake Factory (yes ALL - even those friends that do ironic stuff, drink PBR, talk about bands that you've never heard of, and avoid chain establishments), so I am going to spare you the ambiance, atmosphere, and how there was a 45 minute wait and they don't take reservations.  By now, you know that their menu is pretty extensive, so what I try to do is try something different whenever I am here, even though I have my favorite burgers and pastas here (The Factory Burger and Pasta Jambalaya in case you are wondering). Since I haven't been out in months, due to recently becoming a baby daddy, from what they told me on Maury, I decided to try something new. From the appetizers menu, I ordered the avocado egg rolls.  Very nice concept - 2 green and 2 red ingredients - avocado, cilantro, sun dried tomatoes and red onions -are the star of this show.  This comes with a spicy cashew sauce that has a nice kick to it, similar to what they have at a mongolian grill.  Very nice. For the entree, I couldn't decide between salmon and steak, so I got both.  I am not sure who was in charge of presentation that night or what was going through their mind, but the entree plate had 3 turd-like shapes on it - the salmon, mashed potatoes, and the steak. The herb crusted salmon tasted like it was either marinated or oversteamed in asparagus, which goes hand in hand with the turd shapes, as it resembles a nice urine-like aroma.  A good piece of salmon doesn't really need to be marinated much - add some olive oil and freshly squeezed lemon juice and you are done.  Can't say this was a smash hit for me.   Steak Diane? Whoever was putting this number together at corporate on the menu had an ex-wife named Diane that probably took him for all he was worth because this definitely resembled the taste of self-pity and depression.  If you take a look at the picture I posted, you can barely call that a steak.  There were 6 or 7 little pre-cut pieces (probably because whoever was manning the grill didn't know how to cook to order), swamped in mushrooms.   This was a 2.5 out of 5 star entree altogether, but being out for the first time in months, drinking adult beverages like a nice Pear martini w/ Grey Goose and being on a date with my wife boosted this review to 4 stars.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-freehold?start=120,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.088,3.5600000000000005

193,Maria S.,"Englishtown, United States",0,21,2.0,5.0,2013-02-01,"I've only had good experiences at this location. Yes, there's a wait during peak times, but that's not really something to complain about - what do you expect of a popular chain restaurant attached to a huge, frequently crowded mall? Just put your name in and go shopping for awhile; there's more than enough stores to browse and I've found that the waiting time is often less than what they say it'll be. The location is clean and well-kept. The outdoor area is very nice in the summer. Service is friendly. Speed is okay. They're very busy so the waiters and waitresses are always running around. As for the food, it's the same as any other Cheesecake factory. Enormous portions, calorie-laden, and decadently delicious and calorie-laden. Even the salads are enormous; I always, always have leftovers, sometimes enough for two more meals. Come for lunch for lower prices and more reasonable portions; don't worry, you'll probably still have leftovers anyway! Or come for dinner and just order multiple appetizers for the table and share them instead of getting entrees; the appetizers are also enormous! I LOVE their shepherd's pie; it's my absolute favorite for lunch. Four cheese and pasta da vinci are also good for lunch. Drinks are uber sweet and contain a good amount of alcohol - they're delicious if you don't mind lots of sugar. I'm a fan of the passion fruit mojito in particular. Obviously, the cheesecake is awesome too. They're all amazing but I recommend the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. I didn't think I would like it (looked a little boring to me), but it was WONDERFUL. One of my favorite chains. Higher prices and the wait are well worth the large, delicious portions. Definitely good for a rare treat; don't go too often, as the food is very unhealthy. I know giving 5 stars to a chain is frowned upon by some people, but the thing is, this is New Jersey, not New York City.

Very nice except for something falling from the side of the building onto my plate. That doesn't bother me just took it off but it was pretty funny. Anyway, we got two different sandwiches and shared. We got the grilled chicken and avocado club without bacon. It was just ok. It pretty much just a grilled cheese sandwich which hockey and tomato on it. Nothing special. The the other sandwich was a southwestern grilled chicken. This was really good. The jalapeño peppers on it were pretty damn strong so if you like spicy you'll love it. I did have to take some of the peppers off bc it was too much for me but a delicious sandwich.  I also love how you have a choice of fries or garden salad with the sandwiches.

122,Lauren D.,"Howell, United States",55,16,,5.0,2013-09-09,"This has become one of my all time FAVORITE restaurants! I try something new each time (both entree and appetizer) and have yet to be disappointed. Their menu is HUGE, but the creative variety makes it all the more appealing, not overwhelming as some large menus can be. Every single category is packed with choices, from appetizers, to entrees...desserts and cocktails! I really think they nailed it with providing choices for just about everyone, whether you are there for dinner, drinks, or just dessert (or all 3!). They have unique features to their menu that I feel set them apart. I think their ""Skinny"" menu is GREAT, a lot bigger than some other places I have seen, and satisfying as well. I especially love the section on the menu, ""Small Plates"" because it is perfect for sampling! You can taste a couple different items without filling up before your meal. I usually do this in place of an appetizer, this way I can still enjoy their delicious bread (the pumpernickel is the best!).  Of course, they are known for their delectable cheesecake, and seriously, you cannot go wrong! Honestly, I truly don't care for cheesecake at all, BUT they have so many options that sound so dreamy that I just had to try one...and I have to say I LIKED it because it was not the traditional cheesecake flavors you see most places (strawberry, NY style, chocolatey, etc). So, for me to actually like cheesecake, that says A LOT! Though, I must add their strawberry shortcake is heavenly!!!  If you haven't been here yet, you DEFINITELY must go!!!

126,Mike I.,"Detroit, United States",36,168,35.0,3.0,2013-09-09,"Went here while at the Freehold Mall.  It was just me and my wife which is great because the place is always packed.  Walked up to the counter and told them we were only a table of two and they told us they could sit us immediately.  Smaller parties for the win!   I got the fish tacos and she got her favorite which is the chicken parm sandwich.  The portions here are always much more than you likely need to eat so the price will usually equal out the amount of food you get here.  I will say I'm not a big guy so if you are used to eating 4 tacos and full sides then maybe you don't feel the price is fair.  I actually felt that the tacos were good they had great flavor and I loved the slices of avocado on the top.  The problem was that they put so much taco sauce and other toppings on them I had to eat them with a fork.  I tried to pick up the first one and it just fell apart.  Not a huge issue just weird to order tacos and end up using your fork and knife.    My wife always likes the chicken parm sandwich which she can only eat one half of and takes the other half home.  I've tried it a few times and for a place like The Cheescake Factory they do a pretty decent take on this type of sandwich.  I really like to call Cheesecake Factory a chain diner.  The menu is so huge and they have so many different types of food.  I can go in and have an all Mexican style dinner or have an all Italian dinner.  With that in mind there is nothing that I find on the main menu that blows me away, but I've also never had anything that was not good either.  For dessert we had the red velvet cheesecake.  I have to be honest I have never ordered dessert here before this time.  The cheesecake slice much like the meals was huge and between the two of us we couldn't even finish it after our dinners.  With what I said in my previous paragraph I can see why they call this place the Cheescake Factory.  I really feel out of all the different options they have available on the menu the dessert was very good and stands out.  I'd recommend going here for anyone that is at the mall or in the area.  Like I said I like the food and to add on we have never had bad service either.

It's not even like we gave the wait staff a hard time - no changing orders around, no being rude, we were polite and simple customers.  Frankly, even if we weren't, that behavior isn't acceptable, but that's the only rationalization I could even begin to come up with.

162,Robert C.,"Neptune Township, United States",0,4,,1.0,2013-11-04,"Because of a gift certificate I  received for Christmas, I went here exactly twice. The first time was just OK, which in itself is unacceptable for the prices they charge. When you pay for high end, you expect high end. My food was just OK, and one of the breads they brought out before the meal was pretty nasty. The wheat bread was good, but the white bread was the most disgusting bread I ever tasted. The second time, I got the smokehouse burger, with extra barbecue. First, we got a TINY amount of Barbecue, and I got tired of asking for more. Second, despite asking for medium, it came out a disgusting raw. When I finally tracked down our waitress, she took it, and brought it back 20 minutes later. It was the same burger, and it was still pretty rare. I gave up and ate it. The onion rings I got with it were way undercooked, and disgusting. Burger King Onion Rings would have been a huge step up. Instead of just getting onion rings properly cooked, the waitress wanted to bring me something else instead. I guess she knew something I didn't. I got mashed potatoes. With a ton of salt, they were passable, but not great. My wife had a similar experience. There was no manager anywhere to be found, but as we were leaving, I saw a bunch of suit-types hanging out in back. We were going to get desert, but thought twice about that. NEVER coming back to this location. EVER.  I REALLY wanted to like the Cheesecake Factory. I like the look of the place, and the menu has some nice items. I might try another Cheesecake Factory in another location, but never again in life at the Freehold location. If I had a choice between paying DOUBLE for a McDonalds meal, or going here for free, I'd go to McDonalds. The fact the prices are so inappropriately high is just an extra insult. I think some of my friends are fooled, thinking that, if you pay a lot, it MUST be good, and if it's not, my friends are too insecure to admit it. I'm happy to pay extra for a good meal (Best ever waiter and meal experience was at the Melting Pot in Chestnut Hill, PA), but this is just horribly unacceptable. Send Chef Ramsay here! If you want decent cheap dining, you might be better off sticking to Chili's, TGIFridays, Applebees, etc. Charlie Browns is a nice slight step up.

The great thing about Cheesecake Factory is that their menu is huge and you have a lot of options. The bad thing about Cheesecake Factory is that their menu is huge and you have a lot of options.

My favorite item off the skinny menu is the fish tacos with the side of vegetables and a mojito.  During the warmer months this Cheesecake Factory location offers outdoor dining which faces a few other stores, restaurants and one of the mall entrances. It's a great place for people watching. Even though you are essentially next to a parking lot, the outdoor decor is nice and you forget that.  Can you come to Cheesecake Factory and not order a cheesecake? Well, most times I don't but when I let myself indulge I really enjoy the banana cream cheesecake with fresh banana slices on top. Honestly, this slice of cheesecake is a meal in itself.

The menu is a nice size too, so you are not only selecting from 4/5 options. I chose the Lemon-Garlic Shrimp. It came with asparagus and what seemed like a cup of pasta. This was about 560 calories. Which I appreciated. The flavor was a little -Meh and lacked taste. Like you could definitely tell it was diet food. I didn't really love it, but I didn't really hate it either.

Sadly, nothing has changed.  While the service is fine, but special, the food has degenerated into TGI Friday quality. My kids had southern fried chicken sliders and chicken finger kids meals.  All the chicken was dry.  Plus the fingers are awfully small vs the fingers at other restaurants. I had the stuffed chicken tortillas and replaced the black beans with cilantro rice.  They must have made 10 lbs of rice early in the day and have it sit in a hot pan becuase it was DRY! The chicken tortillas were layers of dryness with soggy corn tortillas. The spicy chicken has absolutely ZERO SPICE.  It is a bit of sauce, but still dry.

However, let's face facts - it's right next to the Freehold Raceway Mall, so it is almost ALWAYS super crowded and there is almost always a wait time. Mentally prepare yourself for this beforehand. And if you have any illusions of getting in on a Friday or Saturday night around dinnertime... well, all I can say is think again.  The menu is ENORMOUS. The menu is so big, IT HAS PAGE NUMBERS. When I have to refer to a dish that is ""halfway down on page 12"" for a friend to find what I am looking at, this means the menu is too big. I'm all for selection, don't get me wrong, but damn, this thing needs a table of contents and an index in the back. All kidding aside, it's a pretty expansive menu, so set aside a good 15 minutes to go through it and select what you want to eat. Bread as a starter is a nice touch, and has always been nice and hot for me. Appetizers are good (my friend loves the Avocado Egg Rolls), but don't forget the ""small plate"" options too as a starter - a lot of these look awesome, cost less than actual appetizers, and come with a ton of food.  Entrees have always been good for me. I personally recommend the pasta carbonara and chicken and biscuits here - sorry I don't have the menu page numbers to refer you to.  Service is spotty at best. It's a big place, with a LOT of tables, so your server has their hands full, no pun intended. Taken with a grain of salt (also no pun intended), it's not that big of a deal.

I ordered a beer and my wife a water and at the same time we put in our food order. It took a bit, but finally the drinks came by and eventually their famous bread basket followed...with only one type of bread as we were told they didn't have any wheat bread. While waiting for our food, we saw everyone else's bread go by, with both types of bread...odd. For our food we ordered two apps to share. One came out followed by the other about 10 minutes later.

I like the way the place is decorated, but that's about it.  My latest visit of course found us waiting for a table. We were given a 15 minute wait time and knowing their track record, I didn't expect it to actually happen. They actually called us right at the 15 minute mark!!  (yes, I was timing them)  we were seated and a waitress took our drink orders.  We then ordered our meals.  Took a half hour to be served and we didn't see the waitress till that point.  I had one of the factory combinations. Steak Diane and herb crusted salmon. The steak had a pretty good taste, all 2 ounces of it!! It was literally 3 pieces of beef each the size of a quarter!! The rest was all mushrooms and onions. The salmon was more like a piece of frozen salmon that they covered in pesto. It was kind of watery as if it had been frozen and thawed upon cooking, which I'm sure it was.  Mashed potatoes were good, but I could have lived without the 3 pieces of ice cold asparagus.  My wife had some fried shrimp over pasta. The shrimp were very greasy. Our son had the chicken enchiladas. Nothing to write home about there either.            Here is what I think is a major problem with this place. The menu is just too big!!  There is no way you can offer that many items and make everything fresh. That means that a lot of the stuff is frozen or pre-prepared.  Cut back on the menu size and do everything fresh and well.  I'm sure that will never happen because no matter what I say, the place is always packed.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-freehold?start=80,3.28,3.21,3.21,2.536,3.238

Perfectly cooked, not chewy at all.  The buffalo blasts was also a delicious appetizer. It was nice and crunchy on the outside with a nice buffalo sauce once you cut into it which allowed for the chicken not to be too dry.  And of course you have to try the cheesecake.

105,Ashley S.,"Manhattan, United States",199,246,103.0,1.0,2015-10-11,"I used to rave about the incredibly friendly service at this location, but they must have had a seriously off night tonight. My family (party of 6) arrived around 4:30 PM on a Tuesday afternoon. We walked up to the hostess stand, and the man behind it was on the phone. We weren't even acknowledged until finally, a waiter stopping by to drop off menus asked if we were being help. Of course, we had to wait for the man on the phone to finish before he could assign us a table. It was early in the evening on a Tuesday so the restaurant was near empty! At the table, it took a few minutes for our waiter to stop by, and we ordered drinks while looking at our menus. A while later, our orders were taken, and our waiter told us he'd be back with our drinks and some bread. It was at least 5 minutes and possibly nearing 10 until we receive our drinks and waters. It was another 15 minutes later before we received our entrees (we ordered 4 Bang Bang Chickens, 1 Spaghetti Carbonara without anything but pasta and broccoli, and 1 Veggie Burger - the only ""first time trying"" entree of the bunch). First came two of the four orders of Bang Bang Chickens. To be polite, we decided to wait to start eating since we figured the other chicken dishes wouldn't be too far behind. About 4 minutes later, another chicken dish and the pasta were delivered. Our waiter stopped by about 5 minutes later asking how we were enjoying dinner, and we told him that we were still missing another chicken and the burger. So 3 minutes later, the last chicken dish arrived. It wasn't until we asked again that we received the veggie burger 3 minutes later. So a total of 15 minutes between the first and last entrees were delivered!! If only the food was worth the wait. Unfortunately, the brown rice was near inedible. I understand it's challenging to cook brown rice, but the pieces on the plates were clearly scraped from the bottom of the pot. Not the delicious crispy bits, but the rock solid pieces that would break or stick to your teeth, if you dare try to bite it. About half the rice on each plate was spit out/pushed aside so we looked around, and our waiter was nowhere to be seen. When he finally came over, he listened to our concerns and said he'll send a manager over. The restaurant was still pretty much empty, but it took at least 5-7 minutes for the manager to arrive. In the end, one of the chicken dishes was remade and new side orders of rice were delivered for the others. The rice was still subpar, but at least it didn't feel as if it'd break your teeth. As for the other dishes, the spaghetti carbonara seemed much less flavorful than usual, and the veggie burger literally tasted like nothing. I was so disappointed about the burger because I strayed from my usual chicken chili to try something that I wouldn't normally make at home. I've had flavorful and tasty veggie burgers in the past but literally had to douse this one in hot sauce and ketchup in a failed attempt to impart some flavor into it. We paid the bill (nope, no reduced charges for the horrible, frustrating experience) and vowed to avoid this restaurant at all costs in the future.

For the éntrees, the Miso salmon is unbelievable. It isn't dry at all and is flavorful. The Thai lettuce wraps are delicious with a nice crisp lettuce and juicy chicken. The lettuce wraps are also very big and colorful. The pastas are always a safe choice. Some of my recommendations are the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, the carbonara, and the Da Vinci are mouth watering. Lastly, you can't go wrong with their cheesecake. Their is a very big variety of cheesecakes and they are all sensational.  The only problem I have is the service. I would say that 3/5 times I come here, the service usually is pretty bad. If you are lucky, you might get a refill on your water.

54,Mark V.,"Freehold, United States",316,138,621.0,2.0,2016-09-15,"Although a crowd favorite at Freehold Raceway Mall, this Cheesecake Factory location disappoints on most levels.   First the good stuff, the exterior and interior decorations are really pleasant and attractive. The bar is really nice I have to admit. The atmosphere is terrific if you were shopping with friends and you want to eat, the menu is extensive, and when they deliver your food the portions are generous and the presentation is very good.  So you are expecting to have a really tasty, above average meal. Unfortunately when the food goes from your plate to your mouth, that's when you realize that the food quality is average.    Now that's not such a bad thing really, and would normally earn a solid three star rating. But the reason for the two stars, is simply the price, it's just too high for ordinary food. The price range for a typical meal is in the $15-$18 range. I believe it should be in the $10-$13 range. Because the food isn't priced to the quality, I'm forced to give a two star rating.   I ordered a shepherds pie which was ground beef and vegetables topped with mashed potatoes with a cheese crust. As exciting as it sounds it was just ordinary. My wife got a Mexican salad which again was presented in an exciting way, but the taste was just OK. Still it's a convenient stop if you were shopping at freehold Raceway Mall with friends and you're looking for a good environment with some good food.

82,Jackie C.,"Oxford Township, United States",50,8,2.0,1.0,2016-09-20,"This is the first time I went to this Cheesecake Factory and it will be the last.   The whole lunch was a mess both in food and service, and I'm pretty easy going about restaurants.   To start, the server forgot to put my margarita in, so we actually received our food before my drink (it seemed to be pure sour mix, also).  My spouse ordered the apple cider and got regular apple juice.  The bread was so stale I couldn't even chew it. As for the food, my spouse is celiac and also has a black pepper allergy.  She ordered the coulotte steak.  It did appear to be gluten-free, since she's not sick, but she was worried because the server didn't seem to know how to handle the black pepper allergy.  The mashed potatoes were loaded with black pepper, which the server didn't state after being informed of the allergy.  The green beans also came with black pepper added on.  If she was informed of the black pepper on the sides, she would have ordered different sides.  The server did end up bringing brown rice as a side for her.  Screwing up allergies is dangerous and for that reason alone we'd be very hesitant to return, since no other area restaurants have had issues accommodating the black pepper allergy. I got the small plates of the fried veggies and one of the shrimp tempura.  The shrimp tempura smelled off and one bite proved the shrimp was off.  This was sent back.  Bad seafood can kill someone.  The fried veggies were good, but also impossible to screw up. Finally, my spouse asked for the mashed potatoes to be boxed up anyway for me.  Upon arriving home, I discovered that the server mixed the mashed potatoes up with the food she could eat.  Literally smashed and spread the mashed potatoes all over it.  This would have been gross, even if the server knew the mashed potatoes had to be separate due to allergies.  Also, I didn't get my dipping sauces included with my leftovers. We left a generous tip, because we always tip servers generously, but with the final straw of seemingly spitefully ruining leftovers with an allergen, we wish we just left 15%.  Honestly, the service deserved less.  We just never tip below that.

So my pasta comes out and I had 2 bites of it and went to have my 3rd bite and saw what at first I thought was a big garlic clove.. I showed my boyfriend and he took it from me immediately and told me it was a big peanut. I was beyond shocked. I'm still shocked. Thankfully I didn't have a reaction. But my anxiety was so high that I thought I was.To me it was intentionally.. How does ONE FULL PEANUT end up in a pasta dish that doesn't even have peanuts in it in the first place. Also the fact that out of all items after alerting the server about my PEANUT ALLERGY TWICE theirs a PEANUT in the dish is way to ironic and suspicious. The manager didn't seem to be concerned or care just gave us his business card and said to call him later that night. Didn't even come outside to make sure I was ok or to say sorry while the EMS and POLICE came. Never in all the 26 years of suffering from this I NEVER had something like that happen. Please be careful going there to eat with allergies! My advice is to avoid completely. They clearly don't care about people's lives and think food allergies are a joke.

49,Sara M.,"Jersey City, United States",2954,538,3321.0,2.0,2017-02-14,"The Cheesecake Factory is never my first choice, yet from time to time I find myself eating at one. During my two most recent visits, hunger and long wait times during peak brunch hours led me here. Apparently my fam and I weren't the only ones who wanted Sunday brunch at Turning Point... there was a 3 hour wait. In any case, the food here is just okay. Ambiance, complimentary pumpernickel bread and mojitos are more than okay, and I'm fine with that masking the lackluster food. Actually, some things on the menu are more than just okay as well. The avocado egg rolls have and always will be a winner. Next time, I'll need to remember to order these as my meal and not as shared app.  The reason I'm not in love with the food is because it's quantity over quality. Their menu is huge (literally, it's like a small novel). While it's great to have lots of options, they could stand to trim the fat a little, and focus on offering less dishes and preparing them really well. Besides menu selection, portion sizes are quantity over quality as well. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich and instead of serving me one delicious chicken salad sandwich, my plate was overflowing with four haphazardly assembled chicken salad sandwiches. Lunch here feels more like a cruise buffet. I'm just not that into it. I feel a little silly complaining... you sort of know what you are getting into when you visit a Cheesecake Factory. But, there are other chains that I like alot better and I think there are a few things that they could work on. Doesn't seem like their menu is changing anytime soon, so next time (because let's face it, there will be a next time) I'll have to be a little more careful about what I order.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-freehold,3.0,2.96,2.96,2.3440000000000003,2.9760000000000004

They deny the change, but, since we've eaten there sometimes as often as twice a week in the past year, I know what amount I was served the last ten times I ordered the same dish.  Then there was a case of moldy bread that we were recently served (I have a severe mold allergy), which resulted in little in a way of apology from the manager.  Finally, the bottom of the bill includes pre-calculated tip amounts, which SHOULD be based in pre-tax bill, but in actuality are percentages of the total bill which includes tax. Now, I don't mind giving the waiter a little extra - we never tip below 20%, but I don't like to be misled like this. It should be my choice how much to give.

Overall the food and service is not bad. Like many reviewers noted, the portions are humongous! After eating here, then eating at another restaurant, it makes you feel gypped and question the value of food at other places. There's good amount of food, but does it taste good? For the most part its hit or miss, with such a big menu, there has to be! After many visits here, these are the dishes my family would order:  avocado eggrolls, thai lettuce wraps, artichoke spinach dip, chicken madeira, masala chicken, shrimp with Angel hair pasta, factory chop salad, cobb salad, oreo cheesecake, white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake, chocolate tower truffle cake, & strawberry shortcake. This place is great for kids - only of you come early, which shouldn't be a problem since they usually eat early.  Otherwise, you'll have to endure a long wait. The food from the kids menu are just ok. They'll eat it, especially if they want dessert! It's loud, so if your kids are acting up, no one would really notice too much. There's also an area by the hostess to park your stroller! With the nice ambience, you don't feel like your roughing it by going to a Friday's or Ruby Tuesday's. I can see why many reviewers are disenfranchised by the wait time and occasional service issues. Those issues are minimal when you eat there early. There's a lot to like - the menu has a huge variety for the most pickiest eater, there's a good salad variety and some gluten free items, reduced calorie menu,  an outdoor patio, there's a bar, there's a nice selection of cakes, cheesecakes and some ice cream as well.

It was a golfball size piece of batter. They should have called it ""orange flavored batter"". What a disappointment. The orange glaze was delicious as usual but the chunks of chicken were so disappointing. The menu is very extensive but this was my favorite until now. I order the chicken pot stickers and the chicken inside vas very good but the sauce they used had a tart vinegar flavor.

He wouldn't let us customize our order. Nothing too crazy but rather exchange side ""x"" for broccoli for example. He wouldn't do it! Dude it's just broccoli instead of ""x"".  Well I guess not today from the order patrol sheriff. It gets better they lost our ticket or something and we were there for an hour no apps no entries no refills for an hour. He didn't bother to check on us or our order we had to flag him down. Our orders finally come out and yea it's sup par even for a chain restaurant. I order pizza and it was raw on the bottom.

I had to actually get the waitresses attention and even then, no apology or explanation. She just did not care. The people that sat down after us, were waited on AND their food was brought out before we even had a chance to place an order. I was so aggravated, we got up and left. The people next to us were in shock as well. Such a huge disappointment! Was looking forward to a nice meal and instead we got treated like crap.

I mean if they were on dessert then ok fine but they had just gotten their drinks. Annoying. Like have some common sense. Kale and Quinoa salad is my go to here. I love the lemon dressing it's perfect and the thin pieces of the lemon peel is so sweet and tender like the kale.  Avocado Eggrolls are always amazing. And the green sauce is so amazing!
