413,Jon C.,"Glen Ellen, CA",0,131,,1.0,2012-01-27,"I've dined several times at the Cheesecake Factory locations in Santa Clara, Mission Viejo and San Francisco.  Like most reviewers, I appreciate the large, varied menu - everything from sandwiches to elegant dishes - and the very good cheesecake.  The food is consistently above-average to very good.  Most Cheesecake Factory restaurants are crowded and noisy.  I've dined at the Fresno location once and felt that the food and surroundings were consistent with the others that I had visited. Two weeks before Christmas, I went to the Fresno location - at mid-afternoon - to buy a cheesecake as a gift.  I waited five minutes at the counter while dining orders were filled and the mostly college-aged waitresses exchanged idle chatter.  When finally served, I asked if they had a 7"" pumpkin (seasonal) cheesecake.  I was told ""absolutely"" and the server charged my credit card  for the cheesecake.  Another server went ""into the back"" to get the cheesecake.  Ten minutes (no exaggeration) later, she returned to tell me they didn't have what I had ordered.  The first server went ""into the back"" to double check.  Ten minutes later, she returned to confirm that they only had a 10"" cheesecake. I reluctantly agreed to purchase the larger cheesecake and handed over my VISA card.  The server charged my card for the full price of the second cake and I asked why she didn't just charge the difference between the two cheesecakes.  I received the typical ""deer in the headlight"" look of confusion.  The shift manager was called over to explain that they would cancel the first charge.  Fast forward two weeks: checked my VISA transactions and, you guessed it, I got charged for both cheesecakes.  Seven phone calls to four different people to get a refund of the first cheesecake.   Forty-five minutes to purchase a cheesecake is ridiculous.  Others have told me of similar experience at this location - I know of several patrons that walked out when they were ignored after being seated.   I've since eaten at other Cheesecake Factory locations, but the Fresno location really doesn't need my business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fresno?start=420,4.04,3.65,3.65,3.236,3.806

109,Tashara H.,"Fresno, CA",106,332,312.0,2.0,2013-02-08,"Disappointing. That's how I'd describe our last visit to this chain restaurant. With all chains, the food is pretty standard between the different locations. What distinguishes each location is the quality of service.   We went to celebrate an anniversary last month, and visited mid-week for dinner. Luckily, we didn't have to wait very long before we were seated. It took quite a while before anyone came to give us water or find out what we wanted to drink. And after our first server took our drink order, she told us her shift was ending, and we were assigned to a different server.   Maybe our mistake was ordering appetizers at the same time that we ordered our entrees.  About 20 minutes after we ordered, our entrees showed up.  I asked the server what happened to our appetizers. He looked at me for a moment and said he'd check on them. As the server started to walk away, I had to call him back and ask him to take back our entrees, and bring them to us after we had a chance to enjoy our appetizers. I don't know about you, but there is no excuse for bringing out entrees before appetizers. That's like forgetting to provide a salad course and then bringing it to the table after dessert.

612,Yer X.,"Chicago, United States",6,8,,3.0,2013-02-09,"The place looks great during the day at Lunch, however I wasn't satisfy by the taste of the food. I came here on my 19th birthday with my sister, and had few orders similar to the one I had in Chicago with my fiance. We had a table immediately with low populated people, which is fine because it's barely afternoon and was served with a wonderful server. I ordered the small plated appetizer, the Palento Fries and Buffalo Wings as my sister has just Buffalo Blast. Just to let you know, we haven't ate the day before, which is why we ordered so much appetizers. The Palento Fries was perfect I have no words for it. But the Buffalo Wings was cooked differ than the way it was from Chicago; the wings was cooked crispy and fries along with the sauce. Nothing different about it, but deep after devouring a two cooked buffalo wings was a chicken drum blood. I didn't say anything cause I lost my appetite. I left it to the side and hoped it would cook in the microwave, soften, but to cook the blood away. I just couldn't say anything, I was upset. My sister's buffalo wings was delish, but too oily to devour it. First of all, I thought it would be a small dish! ...but it wasn't. It was too much our lunch arrived immediately. We took it home for that, but I liked it very well. Now, my sister likes her Chicken Chipotle Pasta meal. I don't like my Orange Chicken. It has that ""too much"" soy sauce beneath the white rice. Another thing is that the white rice is hard when time pass, like as in two-three minutes. The chicken has too much zesty-lemony taste that is differs than it was in Chicago. Now I know I talk how differ this and that, but it's... just isn't the same? I guess I have to get used to it? No, it's the way how I like it. The chicken also, looks uncooked which lead me to be quiet again. My 19th birthday... eating here... was really weird. We ate dessert; I ordered a Reese Cheesecake home, and a Tiramisu Cheesecake and Shortcake there. I actually clarify to the waiter I wanted the cake, cake, not the Tiramisu but they don't have it. Or they just ran out... I was upset and suffered with the Cheesecake. The moisture of it.. just isn't the same. I miss eating it preferably with my fiance. Sighs. My sister did not eat all the Shortcake cause she mistakenly thought it'd be a nice slice of cake.. instead of a cake sliced in half with two scoops of ice cream with strawberries. Otherwise, it's an A-Okay place. I just had problems enjoying the simplicity of its flavor and its un-finished cook meal.

With all chains, the food is pretty standard between the different locations. What distinguishes each location is the quality of service.   We went to celebrate an anniversary last month, and visited mid-week for dinner. Luckily, we didn't have to wait very long before we were seated. It took quite a while before anyone came to give us water or find out what we wanted to drink. And after our first server took our drink order, she told us her shift was ending, and we were assigned to a different server.   Maybe our mistake was ordering appetizers at the same time that we ordered our entrees.  About 20 minutes after we ordered, our entrees showed up.  I asked the server what happened to our appetizers. He looked at me for a moment and said he'd check on them. As the server started to walk away, I had to call him back and ask him to take back our entrees, and bring them to us after we had a chance to enjoy our appetizers. I don't know about you, but there is no excuse for bringing out entrees before appetizers. That's like forgetting to provide a salad course and then bringing it to the table after dessert.

Though I read it in the description, I appreciated that he took the time to make sure I was going to get what I wanted. We also ordered a kids macaroni and cheese (obviously not from a box! and tasty!!) and chicken tacos. Everything was delicious, and surprisingly fast! I ordered a red velvet cheesecake to come out with the food and it was the first to arrive.. no worries, my son was more than excited to have some ""birthday cake"" as he called it. My overall lunch experience was great, I was really surprised and how fast everything came out and how nice everyone was. Great example of how a restaurant should be!

On our first visit, we dropped by for a late lunch which turned out to be an early dinner cause we stuffed ourselves.  Was the perfect time to go because there was no wait and plenty of tables available.  I ordered the Vegetable pizza with goat cheese, and it tasted terrific. The roasted vegetable pizza included roasted eggplant, red & yellow peppers, grilled onions, artichokes, kalamata olives, tomato, mozarella, and I requested goat cheese.  Again, I say that it was terrific!!  Just fabulous!  Too bad it is no longer on their menu!!   Argh!!!!! My better half ordered the Pasta Carbonara w/chicken, and she said that it was delicious as well.  We both had plenty of leftovers to enjoy for two more meals!  On another visit I ordered their Chile Relleno burger because they no longer had my favorite Monterey burger!!  That Chile Relleno burger was almost as good as the Monterey, but not quite!  Found out on my latest visit that they no longer make the Chile Relleno burger!!!  Argh!!!!!!!  What is going on!!! So, for the most recent visit I had to try something different because of the fact they no longer make my favorite entrees anymore.  My choice was called ""The Everything Pizza"".  Well, it was everything except nowhere close to being as good as their Vegetable Pizza with goat cheese from days gone by.  Oh well. My wife discovered a new favorite for herself.  She had a new menu item which was their Chicken Katsu!  It was the best that she has ever had.  I took one bite, and I would have to agree that it was very very good!!  Better than any other restaurant we have been to.  Hard to believe we had it in a Cheesecake Factory restaurant. Of course,  I always save room for cheesecake!!  Their cheesecakes may be too rich and sweet for many people, but that does not bother me one bit.  Yes, i must admit that I am a major sweet tooth!  Almost every cheesecake that I have tried at Cheesecake Factory has been yummy. but very expensive.  Most range from $7.50 to $7.95 a slice. Some of my favorites cheesecakes here are the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, Fresh Banana Cream,  White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia,  and the Caramel Pecan Turtle cheesecakes!  Note that parking is a problem during peak hours so we try to avoid that time. Service has always been terrific.  Cleanliness is not an issue.

Other than that though he thought it was fantastic. I got the bang bang chicken, essentially curry chicken. Although I eat this dish all the time, I still loved it and the sauce was very yummy! The bill was more expensive than expected, but that comes with territory for a higher end place than your average.

My friends and I ordered shrimp scampi, the chicken Madeira, chopped salad, and steak. The chicken was incredible. The flavor was so good and unique, and the chicken was juicy. I think they used wine in it? But it was like gourmet food and so yummy!! The baked shrimp in the shrimp scampi was very flavorful and crunchy with a nice (small) touch of noodles in the middle. The chopped salad was god as well, not sure what sauce they used but this was great for sharing and not messy at all, able to be served with a spoon. I remember it to have a semi-sweet fruity dressing. The steak was juicy and delicious but I don't remember the taste of it as strongly as the chicken madeira (a must get!)  Lastly, we got a banana cream cheesecake, which our server suggested. It was really really good. Light, but the perfect balance between fluffy and dense, it was the perfect way to end the meal. Definitely tasted the banana. It also came with a small saucer of hot fudge which was a great complement to the lightly sweet cheesecake. The whipped cream was also very good!

On our first visit, we dropped by for a late lunch which turned out to be an early dinner cause we stuffed ourselves.  Was the perfect time to go because there was no wait and plenty of tables available.  I ordered the Vegetable pizza with goat cheese, and it tasted terrific. The roasted vegetable pizza included roasted eggplant, red & yellow peppers, grilled onions, artichokes, kalamata olives, tomato, mozarella, and I requested goat cheese.  Again, I say that it was terrific!!  Just fabulous!  Too bad it is no longer on their menu!!   Argh!!!!! My better half ordered the Pasta Carbonara w/chicken, and she said that it was delicious as well.  We both had plenty of leftovers to enjoy for two more meals!  On another visit I ordered their Chile Relleno burger because they no longer had my favorite Monterey burger!!  That Chile Relleno burger was almost as good as the Monterey, but not quite!  Found out on my latest visit that they no longer make the Chile Relleno burger!!!  Argh!!!!!!!  What is going on!!! So, for the most recent visit I had to try something different because of the fact they no longer make my favorite entrees anymore.  My choice was called ""The Everything Pizza"".  Well, it was everything except nowhere close to being as good as their Vegetable Pizza with goat cheese from days gone by.  Oh well. My wife discovered a new favorite for herself.  She had a new menu item which was their Chicken Katsu!  It was the best that she has ever had.  I took one bite, and I would have to agree that it was very very good!!  Better than any other restaurant we have been to.  Hard to believe we had it in a Cheesecake Factory restaurant. Of course,  I always save room for cheesecake!!  Their cheesecakes may be too rich and sweet for many people, but that does not bother me one bit.  Yes, i must admit that I am a major sweet tooth!  Almost every cheesecake that I have tried at Cheesecake Factory has been yummy. but very expensive.  Most range from $7.50 to $7.95 a slice. Some of my favorites cheesecakes here are the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, Fresh Banana Cream,  White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia,  and the Caramel Pecan Turtle cheesecakes!  Note that parking is a problem during peak hours so we try to avoid that time. Service has always been terrific.  Cleanliness is not an issue.

I think they used wine in it? But it was like gourmet food and so yummy!! The baked shrimp in the shrimp scampi was very flavorful and crunchy with a nice (small) touch of noodles in the middle. The chopped salad was god as well, not sure what sauce they used but this was great for sharing and not messy at all, able to be served with a spoon. I remember it to have a semi-sweet fruity dressing. The steak was juicy and delicious but I don't remember the taste of it as strongly as the chicken madeira (a must get!)  Lastly, we got a banana cream cheesecake, which our server suggested. It was really really good. Light, but the perfect balance between fluffy and dense, it was the perfect way to end the meal. Definitely tasted the banana. It also came with a small saucer of hot fudge which was a great complement to the lightly sweet cheesecake. The whipped cream was also very good!

On a recent visit though, I tried their Hibachi steak. Pretty good! For $20, I thought it was well worth it. I would have liked more mushrooms though, but not a big deal. The Snicker Cheesecake I tried was really good as well, and everything else looked pretty good on the menu. My only gripe, is most of their table layouts here. Some of the tables are just way too close to another table. Another group was literally inches away from us, and you can hear their whole conversation.

282,Brutal H.,"Solvang, CA",0,9,,3.0,2015-01-03,"Strawberry Lemonade ""Cheapness"" PROS 1)  Food was acceptable of sufficient portion and brought out quickly.  We had Orange Chicken, Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Kids Quesadilla, Kid's Mac and Cheese and Kid's hot fudge sundae in the restaurant with a slice of Lemon Meringue Cheesecake to go. 2) Wait time was only a couple of minutes to get a seat at about 5pm on a Friday night (January 2nd). 3) Server was prompt and attentive. CONS 1) My strawberry lemonade was 7/8ths ice cubes.  When I made that observation to the server, he stated that that is the only type of drink they are instructed to ""do that"" on.  If I am paying $4.79 for what is essentially sugar water, I shouldn't have to beg for refills because the glass is too full of ice.  Not to mention it inconvenences the server for having to come back and refill it. 2) Tables are too close together.  I physically moved the table after another server's ass was literally hanging over our table to take the order of the couple next to us. 3) Parking is horrendous.  I dropped my family off out front.  Valet was full at $7 cost.  Parked over by JC Penny's after driving around for 5 to 10 minutes. Overall, average of any Cheesecake Factory I've been to.  It's not the Ritz and it is not Del Taco.  I will probably come back, but likely because Fresno seems to have fewer good choices compared to other Cities of half a million people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fresno?start=320,3.28,3.33,3.612,3.1160000000000005,3.31

I would advise you not to come here hungry. Come here with a few friends that you want to catch up with. Order a few drinks and try and get lost in the moment because your food isn't coming anytime soon. I came to have a late lunch with a friend of mine and this was the case.  I was not promptly greeted at the table and I was feeling a bit perturbed about that. My friend finally met me there when the waitress decided to ask me if I wanted anything. But never mind that let's speak on the food. I die for spinach avocado dip. So when I saw on the menu they had crab and spinach dip I thought how bad could this be - its the best of both worlds, right? Wrong. The dip tasted more like a seafood dip with cheese. The crab tasted ""fishy "" not like fresh crab taste. I don't know if they mixed in the crab juice or added some shrimp, it just didn't taste right. All night I've been praying and hoping that I don't run into tummy problems later.  My friend ordered hamburger sliders and the cheese triangles which is a play on the mozzarella sticks. The sliders were very good. The mozzarella triangles were really unique and tasty. My happy hour drink was the Cosmo which was very tasty overall it was a nice time but it was nice because I had great company. Had my girlfriend been a no show, I would have been very up set.

He went and spoke to the employee and came back to let us know he checked the employee's phone and saw no picture. I can't say I believe him, however at that point it didn't matter. My daughter felt so uncomfortable we decided to leave before our food even got to the table. The manager tried convincing us to stay and once we declined, he said he would send us vouchers in the mail for our next meal and for the inconvenience we faced at their establishment.

299,Geral X.,"Fresno, CA",9,5,5.0,1.0,2015-02-13,Came here with my brothers and sisters and in laws for a valentines dinner the day before valentines day. My sister in law called me 4 hours before we planned on meeting up at Cheese Cake Factory and I ask her if she called to make reservations.  She told me she did call them but they told us to just come in and they would seat us. We arrived at 6:4pm and they told us that it was going to be an hour wait. We agreed and waited. As the hour came by we asked the manager if our table was ready yet and he tells us its going to be another 5 to 10 minutes so we tried to be patient and waited. 30 minutes went by and my brother approached the manager (Paul) to ask him again if our table was ready and he said that one of the girls in our group agreed to wait another hour. What the heck? No one talked to the manager other than my brother. My brothers want to BJ's Brewhouse at the bar and the girls went shopping at fashion fair  while i waited for our table. An hour went by and my brothers and sister came back to find the manager making excuses that our group was too big so it took long and that we weren't waiting and that we left (I was still here). 1 star because manager was a D*ck.  No care for customers and no respect.

Got sat down right away but we waited at least 15-20mims waiting to see if a server was going to take our drinks or not. People who sat down after us got served first. Also, there was a table next to us was being served and I know for a fact that their server saw that we've been sitting there for awhile but didn't bother to help us at all. By that time I wanted to leave. My friend had to go up to the front and tell them that we've been waiting for awhile for a server to show up. Funny thing was that it wasn't even busy! So finally a server did come to help us, took our drinks and came back with them. Out of the three of us, one person got a straw and the rest didn't. He came back taking our orders. I was already ready to order and I ordered an entree, my friend was indecisive about what she wanted. She ordered appetizers and the server didn't even ask my bf what he wanted and left right when we ordered.

571,Brutal H.,"Solvang, United States",0,9,,3.0,2015-03-01,"Strawberry Lemonade ""Cheapness"" PROS 1)  Food was acceptable of sufficient portion and brought out quickly.  We had Orange Chicken, Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Kids Quesadilla, Kid's Mac and Cheese and Kid's hot fudge sundae in the restaurant with a slice of Lemon Meringue Cheesecake to go. 2) Wait time was only a couple of minutes to get a seat at about 5pm on a Friday night (January 2nd). 3) Server was prompt and attentive. CONS 1) My strawberry lemonade was 7/8ths ice cubes.  When I made that observation to the server, he stated that that is the only type of drink they are instructed to ""do that"" on.  If I am paying $4.79 for what is essentially sugar water, I shouldn't have to beg for refills because the glass is too full of ice.  Not to mention it inconvenences the server for having to come back and refill it. 2) Tables are too close together.  I physically moved the table after another server's ass was literally hanging over our table to take the order of the couple next to us. 3) Parking is horrendous.  I dropped my family off out front.  Valet was full at $7 cost.  Parked over by JC Penny's after driving around for 5 to 10 minutes. Overall, average of any Cheesecake Factory I've been to.  It's not the Ritz and it is not Del Taco.  I will probably come back, but likely because Fresno seems to have fewer good choices compared to other Cities of half a million people.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fresno?start=320,3.08,3.24,3.48,2.508,3.1760000000000006

I'm not from Fresno and I always look forward to dining at Cheesecake Factory as my hometown does not have one. From the moment our server (Jessica D) greeted us, I knew it was going to be a disaster. All she said was ""Hi"" did not ask my fiance and I how's it going, or what kind of drink we would like. We had to blurt out our orders. She came back with drinks, I accidentally mispronounced the appetizer we wanted and she corrected me very rudely and annoyed. She took our order, did offer any bread. We waited for a good 25 minutes. Our food arrived. She forgot the appetizer, didn't apologize and I told her to forget it. Our food was cold. It was very disheartening to see her attend to every other table she had (we were sitting in the bar area). She gave them great service. But not my fiance and I. It seemed like she was purposely trying to avoid us and would turn away when she passed by. I honestly think its because we are young and Hispanic and she made the assumption she was not going to get a decent tip? We were not checked up on. Only to bring us the check and refill our drinks AFTER we finished our food. Didn't bother asking us if we wanted cheesecake (hello how could you NOT, its the freakin Cheesecake Factory). I was extremely fed up and spoke to the manager. He was half ass listening, said he would speak to Jessica. Didn't apologize. She came to our table and explained we were offered a complementary cheesecake from the manager. Did she apologize? NOPE.  Overall, this experienced ruined this establishment for me.

823,Priscilla W.,"Fresno, United States",332,185,841.0,2.0,2015-05-01,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory on several occasions but today I decided to give my review. Overall it is a timely meal service. I would advise you not to come here hungry. Come here with a few friends that you want to catch up with. Order a few drinks and try and get lost in the moment because your food isn't coming anytime soon. I came to have a late lunch with a friend of mine and this was the case.  I was not promptly greeted at the table and I was feeling a bit perturbed about that. My friend finally met me there when the waitress decided to ask me if I wanted anything. But never mind that let's speak on the food. I die for spinach avocado dip. So when I saw on the menu they had crab and spinach dip I thought how bad could this be - its the best of both worlds, right? Wrong. The dip tasted more like a seafood dip with cheese. The crab tasted ""fishy "" not like fresh crab taste. I don't know if they mixed in the crab juice or added some shrimp, it just didn't taste right. All night I've been praying and hoping that I don't run into tummy problems later.  My friend ordered hamburger sliders and the cheese triangles which is a play on the mozzarella sticks. The sliders were very good. The mozzarella triangles were really unique and tasty. My happy hour drink was the Cosmo which was very tasty overall it was a nice time but it was nice because I had great company. Had my girlfriend been a no show, I would have been very up set. If not I would have realized Hey speak to management about this?",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fresno?start=100,2.56,3.11,3.36,2.7600000000000007,2.8899999999999997

I came in for lunch with my mom, sister, niece, cousin and a girlfriend for lunch last weekend. Between us we had 4 separate tabs. Our server was great, but her shift ended and she came by our table to thank us and introduce us to the male server that would be taking over for her. By this time we were just about wrapped up, and when he came back to check to see if we needed anything else we all decided to order some cheesecake.

887,Alan T.,"Fresno, United States",310,103,238.0,4.0,2015-08-09,"I almost had a five-star experience here. We came here with dessert on our minds and left after consuming a whole lot more than that. We arrived on Labor Day at approx. 9:30 PM. Closing time on this particular evening was @ 11:00 pm. The atmosphere was low light and kind of romantic. Candles were burning at every table. We were seated at a two-person table which is the basis for my only real complaint of the evening - the table just wasn't big enough to allow us eat what we ordered comfortably. Our waitress was extremely friendly, helpful, and attentive the entire time. We started with drinks - I had a beer and my wife had a Blueberry Mojito which she loved. So far so good - off to a very good start.  To eat, we ordered the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps which are build-your-own style. What this means is that they arrive to you in parts - the lettuce,  chicken, sauce, carrots, cucumbers, etc. all come separate on the dish and you build your lettuce wrap yourself. I'd rather them come prebuilt but they were so good I didn't care. The chicken they came with was seasoned and grilled to perfection. The three different sauces that were included tasted great and I used all three together. In total, we were each able to make about 4 lettuce wraps which was more than we expected. Great deal in my opinion. In addition to the lettuce wraps, we ordered the Skinny Shrimp Soft Tacos (skinny calorie-wise) and three very fat (by appearance) soft tacos came to our table. They were filled with lettuce (maybe cabbage), chicken, tomatoes, avocados, and maybe some other items. At this point we were almost too full from the lettuce wraps to pay close attention to what was inside. My wife ate one and I ate the other two. The soft tacos were very good but the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps were the star of the night. We didn't order a main entree and were too full to order dessert (the reason we came lol). Let me add that before we ordered anything, we were given two types of bread (one dark and one light) and butter. The bread was delicious - the perfect combination of crust and softness. Overall, we were both really impressed. We have avoided this place for so long but really for no reason. We just always went to BJ's instead. They have a very extensive menu and a full bar. Another complaint I have is that if I am in the mood to drink a beer and eat, their beer selection is quite slim. This isn't really a complaint though because it's not often I drink and eat. We will definitely be back to try some of the other items that caught our attention on the menu.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fresno?start=120,3.12,3.06,3.236,2.768,3.0840000000000005

458,Alan T.,"Fresno, CA",310,103,238.0,4.0,2015-09-08,"I almost had a five-star experience here. We came here with dessert on our minds and left after consuming a whole lot more than that. We arrived on Labor Day at approx. 9:30 PM. Closing time on this particular evening was @ 11:00 pm. The atmosphere was low light and kind of romantic. Candles were burning at every table. We were seated at a two-person table which is the basis for my only real complaint of the evening - the table just wasn't big enough to allow us eat what we ordered comfortably. Our waitress was extremely friendly, helpful, and attentive the entire time. We started with drinks - I had a beer and my wife had a Blueberry Mojito which she loved. So far so good - off to a very good start.  To eat, we ordered the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps which are build-your-own style. What this means is that they arrive to you in parts - the lettuce,  chicken, sauce, carrots, cucumbers, etc. all come separate on the dish and you build your lettuce wrap yourself. I'd rather them come prebuilt but they were so good I didn't care. The chicken they came with was seasoned and grilled to perfection. The three different sauces that were included tasted great and I used all three together. In total, we were each able to make about 4 lettuce wraps which was more than we expected. Great deal in my opinion. In addition to the lettuce wraps, we ordered the Skinny Shrimp Soft Tacos (skinny calorie-wise) and three very fat (by appearance) soft tacos came to our table. They were filled with lettuce (maybe cabbage), chicken, tomatoes, avocados, and maybe some other items. At this point we were almost too full from the lettuce wraps to pay close attention to what was inside. My wife ate one and I ate the other two. The soft tacos were very good but the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps were the star of the night. We didn't order a main entree and were too full to order dessert (the reason we came lol). Let me add that before we ordered anything, we were given two types of bread (one dark and one light) and butter. The bread was delicious - the perfect combination of crust and softness. Overall, we were both really impressed. We have avoided this place for so long but really for no reason. We just always went to BJ's instead. They have a very extensive menu and a full bar. Another complaint I have is that if I am in the mood to drink a beer and eat, their beer selection is quite slim. This isn't really a complaint though because it's not often I drink and eat. We will definitely be back to try some of the other items that caught our attention on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fresno?start=120,3.24,2.99,3.204,3.216,3.0900000000000007

I guess if you are under 21, have self esteem issues or don't really know anything beyond McDonald's, this MIGHT be the place for you. Otherwise, read on . . . I have personally been to this place around a dozen times over the last 6 years or so. The first few, it was OK. It was like watching Episode IV - A New Hope . . . Then, the new pattern . . . Last time we went - Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back . . . a group of 4 adults & 2 toddlers. Waitress literally rolled her eyes at my mother - Right in front of us ! ! All because she didn't understand the dish description. What a nerve!  We called manager & asked her dismissed from our table. Result - Big upset & left with stomach ache. Today - Same group of people. Arrive right before 5 on a Saturday. Asked for a booth & were tild 15 mins . . . 35 mins later . . . We're called over as beeper rings. We hand beeper over & ARE LEFT STANDING in front of hostess station 5 MORE MINUTES whilest NO ONE addresses us & continue talking amongst themselves. Today Part II - As I complain and ask if anyone is going to take care of us, one of them walks over to see where  a table might be open and directs a busboy to set it up! We ask why no booth (kids) & point over to previously open booths from mere moments ago (now seating someone who got there after us). With attitude, says it'll have to be a few more minutes! Today Part III - Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, I mean, I take it from my parents hands & ask what the problem is ALMOST 40 MINS LATER ! She presents further attitude  (stereotype coming up) . . . and disappears. I think her tongue ring was as disrespectful as her attitude! WE LEAVE!

Always great service and wonderful food. I haven't been in the past 7 months so today I thought I would treat my friends and spouse. Being as one of my friends had never been I thought this would be a wonderful brunch. Unfortunately,  it was not.. I'm not actually sure where I should start.  Let's start when my group got seated. The booth was somewhat dirty,  menu smelled of 'last night's leftovers left on the counter all night' & my waitress was wearing black  jeans. I am not one to be upset by attire usually but since the service was so poor I think it should be noted. I ordered mint tea, wild mushroom soup and the miso salmon. The waitress kept refilling it with green tea. The soup was AMAZING as always. I will never tire of that soup & I'm always excited when it is the soup of the day. That is the only positive note. The miso salmon was too sweet today and the peas were dry. I decided my meal could be overlooked until the waitress asked me if something was wrong w my meal. I told her my issues with the meal and she just stared at me for a minute and then asks me if I want another one. I decline  which is when she offered me "" another meal or something.."" again I  declined and said thank you anyways.

Our waiter was very rude and by the time we got our menus, he was making my daughter very uncomfortable due to his continuous staring. His behavior became so inappropriate that we even saw him trying to take a picture with his cell phone. At this point, I had to ask for the manager and told him what was going on. He went and spoke to the employee and came back to let us know he checked the employee's phone and saw no picture. I can't say I believe him, however at that point it didn't matter. My daughter felt so uncomfortable we decided to leave before our food even got to the table. The manager tried convincing us to stay and once we declined, he said he would send us vouchers in the mail for our next meal and for the inconvenience we faced at their establishment. Needless to say, we never received the vouchers and will most likely never dine at The Cheesecake Factory again.

I'm not from Fresno and I always look forward to dining at Cheesecake Factory as my hometown does not have one. From the moment our server (Jessica D) greeted us, I knew it was going to be a disaster. All she said was ""Hi"" did not ask my fiance and I how's it going, or what kind of drink we would like. We had to blurt out our orders. She came back with drinks, I accidentally mispronounced the appetizer we wanted and she corrected me very rudely and annoyed. She took our order, did offer any bread. We waited for a good 25 minutes. Our food arrived. She forgot the appetizer, didn't apologize and I told her to forget it. Our food was cold. It was very disheartening to see her attend to every other table she had (we were sitting in the bar area). She gave them great service. But not my fiance and I. It seemed like she was purposely trying to avoid us and would turn away when she passed by. I honestly think its because we are young and Hispanic and she made the assumption she was not going to get a decent tip? We were not checked up on. Only to bring us the check and refill our drinks AFTER we finished our food. Didn't bother asking us if we wanted cheesecake (hello how could you NOT, its the freakin Cheesecake Factory). I was extremely fed up and spoke to the manager. He was half ass listening, said he would speak to Jessica. Didn't apologize. She came to our table and explained we were offered a complementary cheesecake from the manager. Did she apologize? NOPE.  Overall, this experienced ruined this establishment for me.

The portion was large which is good for me because I like to eat. The salad was fresh and I liked the dressing. The rice sticks on top of the salad were prepared perfectly but there were way to many.

Last time we went - Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back . . . a group of 4 adults & 2 toddlers. Waitress literally rolled her eyes at my mother - Right in front of us ! ! All because she didn't understand the dish description. What a nerve!  We called manager & asked her dismissed from our table. Result - Big upset & left with stomach ache. Today - Same group of people. Arrive right before 5 on a Saturday. Asked for a booth & were tild 15 mins . . . 35 mins later . . . We're called over as beeper rings. We hand beeper over & ARE LEFT STANDING in front of hostess station 5 MORE MINUTES whilest NO ONE addresses us & continue talking amongst themselves. Today Part II - As I complain and ask if anyone is going to take care of us, one of them walks over to see where  a table might be open and directs a busboy to set it up! We ask why no booth (kids) & point over to previously open booths from mere moments ago (now seating someone who got there after us). With attitude, says it'll have to be a few more minutes! Today Part III - Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, I mean, I take it from my parents hands & ask what the problem is ALMOST 40 MINS LATER ! She presents further attitude  (stereotype coming up) . . . and disappears. I think her tongue ring was as disrespectful as her attitude! WE LEAVE!

Whatever you order, if something doesn't seem right to you - reject it!  It is your hard earned money you are throwing away. We went New Year's Eve. A lot of people. Dark! You can barely see your food, so do not hesitate to bring a flashlight or use your cell phone. The day prior I had just done a take -out off their Skinny menu and really enjoyed their Chicken lettuce wrap tacos - mexican. This time I ordered the same item but the Asian version. Also, I ordered, off the Skinny menu, Grilled Artichokes and later, the Apple Crisp. The artichokes were way overpriced...$7 and just two tiny halves. I don't know why...maybe I just don't eat out very much, but I regret not rejecting that dish outright. The artichoke was tiny...about 3 inches long...both halves of the heart barely made a bite. It would please me very much if any of you reading this, order it and then reject it!   Now, the apple crisp. Pathetic! $8 -- it came in a big shallow dish - goopy! I couldn't tell how it was supposed to be because it was dark! Took a bite or two and decided to just take the whole darn thing home. Well, I just finished taking a closer look at it, and it was raw! It was gooey because they just mixed the entire thing together, apple slices, cinnamon-flavored dough, walnuts. I put the whole thing in my oven and baked it for about 25 mins. It was a little bit better. By the way, the Asian tacos were good, though the chicken was a little dry.

290,Donna G.,"Fresno, CA",0,2,,1.0,2016-01-01,"Beware! Beware! Beware! A real warning if you decide to eat here. Whatever you order, if something doesn't seem right to you - reject it!  It is your hard earned money you are throwing away. We went New Year's Eve. A lot of people. Dark! You can barely see your food, so do not hesitate to bring a flashlight or use your cell phone. The day prior I had just done a take -out off their Skinny menu and really enjoyed their Chicken lettuce wrap tacos - mexican. This time I ordered the same item but the Asian version. Also, I ordered, off the Skinny menu, Grilled Artichokes and later, the Apple Crisp. The artichokes were way overpriced...$7 and just two tiny halves. I don't know why...maybe I just don't eat out very much, but I regret not rejecting that dish outright. The artichoke was tiny...about 3 inches long...both halves of the heart barely made a bite. It would please me very much if any of you reading this, order it and then reject it!   Now, the apple crisp. Pathetic! $8 -- it came in a big shallow dish - goopy! I couldn't tell how it was supposed to be because it was dark! Took a bite or two and decided to just take the whole darn thing home. Well, I just finished taking a closer look at it, and it was raw! It was gooey because they just mixed the entire thing together, apple slices, cinnamon-flavored dough, walnuts. I put the whole thing in my oven and baked it for about 25 mins. It was a little bit better. By the way, the Asian tacos were good, though the chicken was a little dry. Those cooks back there were probably laughing their heads off!  This restaurant needs Gordon Ramsey!! So, not only here but any restaurant, if the food is not right, you have the right to reject it!

191,Hana M.,"Fresno, CA",4,56,31.0,2.0,2016-02-02,"My husband & I came here for a brief get-away lunch...well it ended up as a 2-2 1/2 hour lunch rather than a brief one. We sat ourselves at the bar to get a seat right away, we didn't care for the 30 minutes wait time for a table (by the way, Sunday after church, lunch time, is the worst time to come in!!). Our tall, dark-haired bartender/waiter was very forth-coming & pleasant. He gave us service right away & served my husband his drink immediately. We ordered lunch specials & had a basket of bread as we waited for our meal.  Ok...here is the run down: we arrived around 1:30 p.m. Sat at the bar & placed our order by 1:40 p.m. I was watching the Chicago Bulls vs. LA Clippers game, 3rd quarter in. I'm enjoying the moment with my husband as the time flies, making plans for vacations and so forth. ********* So its the end of the game (the Clippers won by the way), we had our second basket of bread & butter. My husband had to limit himself with a second beer, since he was driving and its 3:00 p.m. (-_-) ONE HOUR AND SOMETHING MINUTES FOR OUR FOOD. Wait, let me be honest because I'm rounding off the time, maybe it was 2:58p.m. for our food to actually arrive.  I do have to point out that the bartender/waiter was courteous & kept his actions professional, but it doesn't justify why our food took forever to come out! You would think we would get a discounted price on our meal...nope. ********* As for the meal overall: I ordered the ""Pasta Shrimp & Sausage"" plate, my favorite! My twist into this meal is I prefer angel hair pasta instead of the rigatoni that it comes with. Why you may ask; well I like the texture of the angel hair & I feel like the rigatoni takes away focus of the meal--which I believe the shrimp & sausage should be the main highlight of the plate. And yes, I've ordered this before so I know what I am getting myself into. Usually with this plate, the meal is super hot to eat right away & the steam is literally rising from the sauce. Well, it wasn't--I was able to scarf half of this plate down by 3:15 p.m. Same goes for my husband, he ate his macaroni burger, practically in one gulp. The sweet potato fries wasn't fresh from the fryer and it didn't have its usual crisp. So the food, honestly, for the price we paid, was not worth it at all.  ******** Cheesecake: ordered the Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake. This is somewhat of a German chocolate cake wannabe. Not too bad and it was worth the try, but will not order again. Yes, we had our mind set on a cheesecake in the middle of our 1 hr and something minutes wait; so this was ordered right after our meal. From the variety I have had, this cheesecake doesn't rank up into the top 10 category.  ******** The incident: yes, something happened overall this unsatisfactory visit. So yes we're human, we all make mistakes. Another waiter assisted us while our tall, dark-haired bartender/waiter stepped away for a few minutes. Well this waiter in particular, attended to us & happened to assist us with boxing away my pasta. He made a light conversation but he didn't realize he wasn't placing the pasta into the take-home box, rather than the bar counter top. Let me rephrase that: he was placing the pasta on top of the bar counter-top instead of the take-home box...*****let that sink in*****yes, I know, it was a mistake. My husband and I have a great sense of humor...so we laughed it off--this was not intentional, it was an honest mistake. I felt bad for the waiter, but he did offer a lunch-size special of the pasta to be taken home. I felt he was embarrassed for his actions (since he scooped up the pasta and didn't clean up the remainder of the sauce on the counter-top, and continued serving the rest of the bar). As soon as our tall, dark-haired bartender/waiter returned, the other waiter disappeared.  ******** The take-home product: yes I received my meal just how I wanted--with angel hair. But as I dug into it the next day, I noticed there was some rigatoni pasta noodles mixed in. No big deal but for such a high class restaurant, you would think something as simple as this shouldn't happen.  ******** The reasoning behind the two stars:  *I didn't take a star off w/the 2nd waiter who helped us because it was a mistake, even though we waited another 20 mins for the take-home pasta.* 1. First star was taken off due to the wait-time of our food. It wasn't our tall, dark-haired bartender/waiter's fault because there are other servers that could have caught this.  2. Second star was taken off due to the quality of our food. Please see the above details.  3. Third star was taken off due to the take-home product. It wasn't made from the chef's heart. Going to a restaurant like this and paying the prices we pay for the outcome to be shitty, makes me wonder if the chef's heart was in the right place to cook this food for me.

So we finally tried this place for the first time, especially after hearing all the hype. Well, let's start with the food---reason why they got a 3/5 from me. The stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer were delicious, great seasoning. For the lunch pasta price, holy cow that was a huge portion, I had the shrimp and sausage pasta. It was ok, nothing out of this world, and it failed to impress. My husband's herb-encrusted chicken was alright, he enjoyed it, the mashed potatoes were plain, lacked seasoning, but the asparagus was delicious and very flavorful. I also ordered sweet potato fries with the yummy sauce on the side, and those were so yummy!! For dessert, we got the original cheesecake, and I was really looking forward to that first bite because I fugured it would be magical, but it was disappointing. For being named after cheesecake, I really expected more. Honestly, my mom makes better cheesecake.  Now on to customer service, that I give them a 5/5. Super courteous, each step was perfect--from the phone to the pick up. If you don't want to get out of your car, then use curbside.

104,Karen S.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,221,49.0,5.0,2016-02-24,"It's not often that I receive stellar service at CCF were we should be treated with respect . I want to thank our server, Sayash G for her great service that night.  We went in on Valentine's Day with 4 children and two teenage parents.  I find it rather embarrassing to have to bring such young adults with their children because I know that their children could make a rather perfect evening dinner  go miserable. But because they are family, you just have to deal with it.  Luckily, Sayash had patience with our table and was extremely accommodating. She put my worries at ease as she came multiple times to check on our table and bring us anything that we needed.  She also had help from other server, but I didn't take down her name.

The chicken is very flavorful & juicy, on top of the chicken is some delicious mushrooms, and it comes with a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus. All of it is delicious and honestly one of the best dishes I had. You can't go wrong with ordering that. For dessert my all time favorite is the red velvet cheesecake.

There was no fire, it was just a false wire. The manager came over after we asked to speak with him, and was extremely rude and dismissive, and said there was nothing he could do. We asked to move outside thinking it would be better and he said we just had to deal with it because the fire department had to check everything before they left and there was nothing they could do about the flashing lights. With a guest at our table with a seizure disorder, he still would not make any accommodations to help us.  Out waitress brought us bread and is was cold and stale. We waited 30 minutes for new bread and it was still cold. Our dinner took an hour to come out and it wasn't even busy since everyone left from the FALSE fire alarm.

To keep it simple and to the point the issues we experienced was the following 1. Dirty silverware 2 sets. 2.Unknow floating objects in my water black in color. 3 tons of flys. 4. When asked the waitress does the burrito have onions inside?, answer-no, burrito had grilled onions!, dish was returned. 5 Manager who we addressed about concerns, Garret was very dismissive to all of us along with some smart*** comments ""so nothing was good I can't believe that"" really last I checked I'm the paying customer with very valid concerns and for my family & friends to have the manager NOT TO APOLOGIZE FOR ANYTHING and to turn his back and walk away.

820,Erin A.,"Fresno, United States",50,63,70.0,3.0,2016-06-08,"Came here for the half price cheesecake but ended up ordering an appetizer, as well. We got the Thai Chicken Lettuce wraps and ironically the chicken was my least favorite part. The menu listed ""grilled chicken"" but the grill marks were so black and deep that the chicken just tasted dry and burnt. All the rest of the ingredients were delicious, though, and so were the sauces. I made a wrap of just the cabbage and pickled cucumber (and sauce) and it was soooooo good! Maybe next time I should just nix the chicken LOL. Now onto the cheesecake... My personal favorite is the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake but I decided to try something different this time. I tried the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle and it was delicious! Perfect balance of cheesecake, white chocolate and raspberry flavor. Delightful and refreshing on a 100+ degree day! My husband got the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake and it was good but a little too rich. I don't like the taste of fake peanut butter that they use in other peanut butter cups but this was made with the real stuff. The rich peanut butter flavor was nicely balanced with the cheesecake but it was overwhelming after a few bites. I also tried the Snicker's Bar Chunks and Cheesecake which is basically their regular cheesecake with chopped up Snicker's on top. It was delicious and paired nicely with the cheesecake without overwhelming it.  The sour note to my visit was the restrooms. The toilet paper was falling out of the holder in multiple stalls as someone didn't shut the doors properly after refilling them. The wood on the vanity was all scratched up and the trap door was open, exposing the pipes. For such a nice looking restaurant to have such an unkempt restroom was a shock. I was hesitant to use the toilet paper as it had obviously been dropped on the floor multiple times but the roll on the holder bar was at a funny angle as the door wasn't properly closed which rendered it completely unusable. So I had no other choice. I'll definitely be getting takeout next time.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fresno?start=100,2.88,3.18,3.148,2.7960000000000003,3.0600000000000005

Unfortunately Craig is no longer working there and I heard he's moving up the ranks in the restaurant business to become a manager. I usually dine at the bar because they give you better, faster service than regular sitting at the table. Anyways on to tonight service and food I ordered the following: Arnold Palmer 3/5 it was ok nothing stood out. Egg Roll Sampler 2/5 each varieties of egg rolls sucks each has different flavor and I wasn't too impressed I took each bite and told the server to take it away. Green Salad with croutons & honey mustard dressing 2/5 the croutons weren't crunchy and lack of flavor on the honey mustard dressing. Smokehouse BBQ burger with American Kobe Beef patty 3/5 for a $17 dollar burger normally I can finish a whole burger but even with the thick cut bacon and BBQ sauce and fried onion strings the flavor was plain and not worth the $17 Server 2/5 yes service was good but my server complained about working weekends and complained about her hours I'm like at least you have a job. I haven't been here for awhile and I'm not missing much. Their food was ok nothing special and nothing stood out. I wished Ruth Chris would open later on the weekends because their prime burger is the best burger in town. Service was kinda annoying tonight hearing your server complaining about work and etc...

To keep it simple and to the point the issues we experienced was the following 1. Dirty silverware 2 sets. 2.Unknow floating objects in my water black in color. 3 tons of flys. 4. When asked the waitress does the burrito have onions inside?, answer-no, burrito had grilled onions!, dish was returned. 5 Manager who we addressed about concerns, Garret was very dismissive to all of us along with some smart*** comments ""so nothing was good I can't believe that"" really last I checked I'm the paying customer with very valid concerns and for my family & friends to have the manager NOT TO APOLOGIZE FOR ANYTHING and to turn his back and walk away.

810,Lani M.,"Fresno, United States",23,62,104.0,4.0,2016-08-04,"I hate the fact that there is always a wait. That's probably why I don't come as much plus it's a little pricey sometimes. So for starters I always ask for the brown bread only because it is so delicious!  I haven't ate here to much but out of all the entree's I have ordered the chicken madeira is by far the best dish. The chicken is very flavorful & juicy, on top of the chicken is some delicious mushrooms, and it comes with a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus. All of it is delicious and honestly one of the best dishes I had. You can't go wrong with ordering that. For dessert my all time favorite is the red velvet cheesecake. Even though it's about 1300 calories, it's worth it sometimes to share a slice with your friends or if you're having a bad day than ""baby you deserve it!"" haha it's ok to indulge in some sweet red velvet cheesecake sometimes. But this is honestly my favorite cheesecake here besides the original strawberry cheesecake.

22,Erin A.,"Fresno, CA",50,63,70.0,3.0,2016-08-06,"Came here for the half price cheesecake but ended up ordering an appetizer, as well. We got the Thai Chicken Lettuce wraps and ironically the chicken was my least favorite part. The menu listed ""grilled chicken"" but the grill marks were so black and deep that the chicken just tasted dry and burnt. All the rest of the ingredients were delicious, though, and so were the sauces. I made a wrap of just the cabbage and pickled cucumber (and sauce) and it was soooooo good! Maybe next time I should just nix the chicken LOL. Now onto the cheesecake... My personal favorite is the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake but I decided to try something different this time. I tried the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle and it was delicious! Perfect balance of cheesecake, white chocolate and raspberry flavor. Delightful and refreshing on a 100+ degree day! My husband got the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake and it was good but a little too rich. I don't like the taste of fake peanut butter that they use in other peanut butter cups but this was made with the real stuff. The rich peanut butter flavor was nicely balanced with the cheesecake but it was overwhelming after a few bites. I also tried the Snicker's Bar Chunks and Cheesecake which is basically their regular cheesecake with chopped up Snicker's on top. It was delicious and paired nicely with the cheesecake without overwhelming it.  The sour note to my visit was the restrooms. The toilet paper was falling out of the holder in multiple stalls as someone didn't shut the doors properly after refilling them. The wood on the vanity was all scratched up and the trap door was open, exposing the pipes. For such a nice looking restaurant to have such an unkempt restroom was a shock. I was hesitant to use the toilet paper as it had obviously been dropped on the floor multiple times but the roll on the holder bar was at a funny angle as the door wasn't properly closed which rendered it completely unusable. So I had no other choice. I'll definitely be getting takeout next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fresno?start=100,3.28,3.09,3.196,3.34,3.166

After ordering they brought the main dishes before the appetizer. Instead of the manager apologizing he makes a smart ass remark and drops the food off.

There were rye, sourdough, and white bread served at the table with butter. The rye was everyone's favorite pick. I had the Shrimp Garlic noodles. To be honest, there were very little taste and smell of garlic. Some of the shrimp still had partial shells on it. It's spaghettini with asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, roasted tomatoes, and parmesan with garlic sauce.

Anyways on to tonight service and food I ordered the following: Arnold Palmer 3/5 it was ok nothing stood out. Egg Roll Sampler 2/5 each varieties of egg rolls sucks each has different flavor and I wasn't too impressed I took each bite and told the server to take it away. Green Salad with croutons & honey mustard dressing 2/5 the croutons weren't crunchy and lack of flavor on the honey mustard dressing. Smokehouse BBQ burger with American Kobe Beef patty 3/5 for a $17 dollar burger normally I can finish a whole burger but even with the thick cut bacon and BBQ sauce and fried onion strings the flavor was plain and not worth the $17 Server 2/5 yes service was good but my server complained about working weekends and complained about her hours I'm like at least you have a job. I haven't been here for awhile and I'm not missing much. Their food was ok nothing special and nothing stood out. I wished Ruth Chris would open later on the weekends because their prime burger is the best burger in town. Service was kinda annoying tonight hearing your server complaining about work and etc...

So we finally tried this place for the first time, especially after hearing all the hype. Well, let's start with the food---reason why they got a 3/5 from me. The stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer were delicious, great seasoning. For the lunch pasta price, holy cow that was a huge portion, I had the shrimp and sausage pasta. It was ok, nothing out of this world, and it failed to impress. My husband's herb-encrusted chicken was alright, he enjoyed it, the mashed potatoes were plain, lacked seasoning, but the asparagus was delicious and very flavorful. I also ordered sweet potato fries with the yummy sauce on the side, and those were so yummy!! For dessert, we got the original cheesecake, and I was really looking forward to that first bite because I fugured it would be magical, but it was disappointing. For being named after cheesecake, I really expected more. Honestly, my mom makes better cheesecake.  Now on to customer service, that I give them a 5/5. Super courteous, each step was perfect--from the phone to the pick up. If you don't want to get out of your car, then use curbside. Super easy and they made sure to accommodate us in every way possible.  Nothing was left out, including bread & butter.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fresno?start=260,3.48,3.47,3.292,2.636,3.474

I first walked up to the hostess stand where there were two women, and both of them didn't acknowledge me for about 5 minutes it was very awkward and rude. I felt like they could of at least said i'll be with you in a moment. but no, nothing.  We got sat fairly quick at a table, I asked the waitress if she could sit us at a booth and she found one in another location and sat us there. We got our drinks and meal ordered quickly and our waitress was on top of bringing us our refills and bread. She was kind of standoffish though and didn't seem too friendly.  I ordered pasta and my boyfriend ordered a burger, she brought out his burger and left and I was assuming bringing out my pasta, 5-10 mins go by still nothing. She comes out says they are still working on my pasta then leaves. It's always a pet peeve of mine when a restaurant brings out one persons meal but not the other at the same time. Finally I think a manager or supervisor came by and apologized for the wait, said there was some kind of mix up and my meal was being re processed... he offered me a side salad or fries but I declined. My boyfriend doesn't eat his food until my food is at the table out of respect so while my food was getting re cooked his food was getting cold. The manger offered to put his food under a heat lamp until mine was ready. My meal finally came out about an hour after I ordered and everything seemed fine, I noticed there was two kinds of pasta in my dish when there's only supposed to be bow tie but that wasn't a big deal. My boyfriends food however was cold. I was just disappointed because I told my boyfriend how much I love the Cheesecake Factory and then when we finally go, everything just fell short.

I felt like they could of at least said i'll be with you in a moment. but no, nothing.  We got sat fairly quick at a table, I asked the waitress if she could sit us at a booth and she found one in another location and sat us there. We got our drinks and meal ordered quickly and our waitress was on top of bringing us our refills and bread. She was kind of standoffish though and didn't seem too friendly.  I ordered pasta and my boyfriend ordered a burger, she brought out his burger and left and I was assuming bringing out my pasta, 5-10 mins go by still nothing. She comes out says they are still working on my pasta then leaves. It's always a pet peeve of mine when a restaurant brings out one persons meal but not the other at the same time. Finally I think a manager or supervisor came by and apologized for the wait, said there was some kind of mix up and my meal was being re processed... he offered me a side salad or fries but I declined. My boyfriend doesn't eat his food until my food is at the table out of respect so while my food was getting re cooked his food was getting cold. The manger offered to put his food under a heat lamp until mine was ready. My meal finally came out about an hour after I ordered and everything seemed fine, I noticed there was two kinds of pasta in my dish when there's only supposed to be bow tie but that wasn't a big deal. My boyfriends food however was cold. I was just disappointed because I told my boyfriend how much I love the Cheesecake Factory and then when we finally go, everything just fell short.

12,D M.,"Fresno, CA",1,25,11.0,1.0,2017-04-09,"You know, I never wrote a bad review of this place before because the place is beautiful inside, the food is delicious and well plated, and the waitresses/waiters are usually very nice too. But I have had multiple issues with this restaurant and this one was the straw that broke the camel's back.  We had a perfect afternoon eating here and great food and service until we got the bill. I looked at it and they charged $8.50 for our strawberry cheesecake (no, we didn't need to add to our body's abundant fat reserves but it was my parent's anniversary). Yet all their menus showed the price was $7.95.  So I told the waitress I knew it was splitting hairs but it's the principle of the thing and she understood that and went and talked to her manager. While I realize I'm having a lunch that costs more than your usual fast food or sandwich, I'd still be a spoiled fool to act like 55 cents meant nothing.  She came back and basically said ""I'm sorry about that, but we raised our prices and our system is in transition is that okay?"" Nooo it's not okay to be lied to about this. I told her no and she went and told the manager. The manager came back and told us the same thing. First off, this shouldn't have been an issue to begin with; they should have correct pricing on all their menus at all times. Second, they should have corrected the error for us immediately. Third, you should never tell a customer some excuse and still make the customer responsible for it. I told him as such and he just looked at me and shook his head as if to say ""sorry you don't like it but tough luck we won't change it for you."" Sure enough, they didn't change it on the bill they brought back. This is misrepresentation and illegal. You're lucky we didn't walk out completely.  I mean here's the bottom line: YOU squabbled with a customer for 55 cents. You lost a customer. OVER 55 CENTS. Petty, petty restaurant. Oh and I forgot to mention, on our way to the parking two valets nearly backed into us! Part 2: This is actually a prequel to today's fiasco. A few months ago a friend and I went to eat here. Her and my favorite appetizer is the avocado eggroll plate. We ordered a plate of them but were told they were out of avocado even though we saw other plates of food being served with avocado. It must have been another issue with the eggrolls themselves but either way we were very disappointed. Now some background - I live a half hour away from this Cheesecake Factory so to go there is a special trip. A week later I called and asked specifically if they now had avocado eggrolls in stock and available to order to go. The person on the phone said ""we sure do!"" very confidently. So I took a trip down there, I went in and went to the to go counter to order, and they told me they still didn't have them available. This had me steaming. Obviously no one in this restaurant commmunicates with each other. Well I went home and wrote a complaint through the website. A while later I got an apology letter and a gift card from the manager. I figured at this point that at least the communication problem would have been addressed. So a week later I call, and I ask the same thing. They tell me the same thing they did when I called before: ""we sure do have them available!"" Well guess what? I drive down there and they're still unavailable. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE!? You can probably guess how upset I was, and of course I complained online again. I didn't get a response for a couple of months in the form of a letter from the manager asking me to call him. Well I kept calling and every day someone told me that he had 'just' left. Yeah right. Just awful, I'm done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fresno?start=80,3.16,3.45,3.352,2.34,3.334

She remarked that her Cosmo was one of the best she's ever had--truly a huge compliment considering her expertise. Our zucchini appetizer was perfectly cooked. The oil was not old and the vegetable had a slight amount of crunch, making it delightful. My wife's fish and chips were cooked nicely but she found the fish to be cut too small making it feel mealy in her mouth.

About 3 weeks ago we try to put our names down to get a table and the hostesses ignored us for nearly 15 minutes. They were to busy talking about their dates and other things that may be really important to them but should not be that important whena guests is waiting. We got tired and decided to leave to end up at another chain restaurant where the host staff did not neglect us.

92,Julie A.,"Lemoore, CA",0,5,2.0,1.0,2017-05-08,"I had brunch with about 13 friends here and we'll never come again. I was told they did not take reservations when I talked to a hostess a couple weeks before our event (even though I told them we had a large party), so I decided to call an hour ahead of time to put our name in the waiting list. I was told they only took reservations until 11am (contradictory to what I'd been told before) and wouldn't take our name and that the restaurant wasn't busy so we'd have no problem being seated. Upon arrival, the restaurant was busy and we were told that we'd be seated once half our party arrived. When that happened 15 minutes later, I went to the hostess and we were then told if we wanted to eat inside we'd have to wait an hour and a half! We ended up seated outside after waiting 35 minutes. This could've been avoided had the restaurant taken my name down an hour ahead of time, especially since we had a large party. This wasn't the only problem, though. Once everyone paid, the manager and server came out and accused two people in our party of not paying, which was ludicrous. They claimed to have cameras inside to prove this, yet we were seated outside, so no footage could show what happened between collecting our payments and taking them inside the restaurant. After we complained, the server said it was ""a misunderstanding"" yet the manager never came out to apologize for their accusations. We will not be bringing our business to this location again.

I came into town for a big women's motorcycle weekend earlier this month and was meeting an old colleague I had not seen in years there after I rode into town and was staying at hotel a few blocks away. We met for lunch. We were seated quickly. Since she picked me up, I indulged in a refreshing pina colada. I may have had two..they were good. I was not super hungry, so ordered the Thai lettuce wraps. I was very impressed at the presentation. Fresh, vibrant ingredients to assemble the wraps. It had chicken satay pieces, carrots, noodles, sprouts and a few other things I forgot. Also came with three sauces..one was a peanut sauce..and two chili sauces..everything was flavorful. I ate some and packed up the rest which became a late night snack in my hotel room! Two days later after alot of motorcycle riding, I decided I would have brunch before I started the long ride home. It was a Sunday around noon. I was on my motorcycle and had to circle around the parking area a few times. They rope off a large section of parking in front of the restaurant next door to offer valet service. That was a bit annoying. I lucked out as someone pulled out of a spot in back! I decided to just sit in the high tables in the bar rather than wait for a regular table. It is open seating in bar. I had my motorcycle gear and helmet so was nice to get a table with extra chairs.  I decided on the fried chicken and waffles. So glad I did! Delicious from start to finish. It was chicken tenders, perfectly battered..light and crispy and tender meat. The small waffle sections were perfectly light and had a little crisp to them as well. The home fry potatoes, which I usually hate at every restaurant that comes with a breakfast were GREAT. Just what I like. These were smaller bits of potato..I am not sure how they prepare them but was almost like they twice fried them...they were not greasy..but all perfectly crunchy and crispy.

It is really flavorful with a generous amount of almonds to give it both taste and crunch. I always skip the fries and substitute them with a tossed green salad, which they do very well. I have two complaints: 1/ The cleanliness of the bathrooms could be much better. They just need more frequent servicing. 2/ The quality of the service. When I was there yesterday, it took literally 20 minutes to be approached by the server. (I was seated at one of the high tables in the bar area, which is open seating & usually very nice) I was so thirsty when the young lady came to finally take my order and requested a large glass of water to start with. Then I gave her my order. 15 minutes later, with no water to drink, after waiting now for 35 minutes, I flagged down another server and asked for a glass of water, *please* !! He quickly brought one over. Another 10 minutes passed, noticing the girl was now taking orders for another table not far from me, so I flagged the same guy again and ordered a margarita, which he brought promptly. So, now it's been 45 minutes...and a totally different server was finally bringing my Chicken Almond Salad sandwich...the first server still busy with different tables. I asked about the first girl who had taken my order and the new (third one now) server told me she was still my server, but that she got really ""busy"". I decided to talk with the manager about it, who I found to be extremely defensive. He could barely get out an apology ~ it was obviously hard for him to admit there were problems with the serve staff. He left, saying he would ""talk with the girl"". I began to lose my appetite at this point and wanted to get my check and pay the bill. I looked around for all three servers who had waited on me; they were nowhere to be seen. So I got up and walked over the the server's station and asked someone to please bring my check over. They smiled and promised they would do that. Another 20 minutes passed....I had time to finish my drink and take a couple more bites of the sandwich, but was feeling ignored and disrespected. I got up and walked over to the kitchen area to find someone to get the manager for me again. When he showed up (which took some time), I told him I had been waiting for 20 minutes just to get my check. He finally said there would be no charge for my meal and *almost* apologized this time, albeit defensively. It was a disappointing experience and I'm not sure I will be back anytime soon.

Then I gave her my order. 15 minutes later, with no water to drink, after waiting now for 35 minutes, I flagged down another server and asked for a glass of water, *please* !! He quickly brought one over. Another 10 minutes passed, noticing the girl was now taking orders for another table not far from me, so I flagged the same guy again and ordered a margarita, which he brought promptly. So, now it's been 45 minutes...and a totally different server was finally bringing my Chicken Almond Salad sandwich...the first server still busy with different tables. I asked about the first girl who had taken my order and the new (third one now) server told me she was still my server, but that she got really ""busy"". I decided to talk with the manager about it, who I found to be extremely defensive. He could barely get out an apology ~ it was obviously hard for him to admit there were problems with the serve staff. He left, saying he would ""talk with the girl"". I began to lose my appetite at this point and wanted to get my check and pay the bill. I looked around for all three servers who had waited on me; they were nowhere to be seen. So I got up and walked over the the server's station and asked someone to please bring my check over. They smiled and promised they would do that. Another 20 minutes passed....I had time to finish my drink and take a couple more bites of the sandwich, but was feeling ignored and disrespected. I got up and walked over to the kitchen area to find someone to get the manager for me again. When he showed up (which took some time), I told him I had been waiting for 20 minutes just to get my check. He finally said there would be no charge for my meal and *almost* apologized this time, albeit defensively. It was a disappointing experience and I'm not sure I will be back anytime soon. I can't figure out why the serving staff is so disorganized and slow. The restaurant really wasn't all that busy ~ I had arrived at 11:00 a.m.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fresno?start=100,3.2,3.19,3.216,3.0800000000000005,3.194

When I asked for plastic silverware after my food was brought, I put my hand out to grab them from my waitress she put them right on the table ugh:-| defeated the purpose of me asking smh, I just wiped my fork off and prayed for the best.

Sadly, it was a very disappointing visit. My department decided to have our holiday department luncheon with a large party of 15 on a time limit. I decided to order the skinny chicken pot pie. When it arrived, there were only two tiny pieces of chicken in that whole platter full of gravy.  I called the waitress over to inform and show her my plate and asked if they could at least put a few more pieces of chicken. The waitress returned from the kitchen and said the chef told her there was enough chicken and returned my plate to me (nothing was added).  I then asked for a different item but that wasn't any better because it took extra long for it to come out. By the time it came out,  my team was finishing eating their dessert so I asked for the plate to go.  My team was already eating dessert at this point so I asked the waitress if they could at least throw in a piece of cheesecake since they took so long to bring out the new plate and for the fact that I didn't get to enjoy my meal with my team. The manager came back and said no, he would not offer a free piece of cheesecake.   Now, normally I wouldn't mind being told no but this manager was very rude and spoke to me in an angry tone. The Cheesecake Factory is not cheaply priced and you would expect more from a reputable place to recitify a failure on their part to provide decent service even if just a simple apology.  I've had many years in customer service management and know how management should conduct themselves in business. This was very unprofessional and any manager who speaks to their customers in this tone should not be a manager. I will be contacting corporate office and anyone else I need to to let them know just how poorly Garry Choi conducted himself.

I was told they did not take reservations when I talked to a hostess a couple weeks before our event (even though I told them we had a large party), so I decided to call an hour ahead of time to put our name in the waiting list. I was told they only took reservations until 11am (contradictory to what I'd been told before) and wouldn't take our name and that the restaurant wasn't busy so we'd have no problem being seated. Upon arrival, the restaurant was busy and we were told that we'd be seated once half our party arrived. When that happened 15 minutes later, I went to the hostess and we were then told if we wanted to eat inside we'd have to wait an hour and a half! We ended up seated outside after waiting 35 minutes. This could've been avoided had the restaurant taken my name down an hour ahead of time, especially since we had a large party. This wasn't the only problem, though. Once everyone paid, the manager and server came out and accused two people in our party of not paying, which was ludicrous. They claimed to have cameras inside to prove this, yet we were seated outside, so no footage could show what happened between collecting our payments and taking them inside the restaurant. After we complained, the server said it was ""a misunderstanding"" yet the manager never came out to apologize for their accusations. We will not be bringing our business to this location again. They need to learn proper customer service to earn it back. Take my advice and go somewhere else!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fresno?start=40,3.52,3.27,3.348,2.468,3.37

But I have had multiple issues with this restaurant and this one was the straw that broke the camel's back.  We had a perfect afternoon eating here and great food and service until we got the bill. I looked at it and they charged $8.50 for our strawberry cheesecake (no, we didn't need to add to our body's abundant fat reserves but it was my parent's anniversary). Yet all their menus showed the price was $7.95.  So I told the waitress I knew it was splitting hairs but it's the principle of the thing and she understood that and went and talked to her manager. While I realize I'm having a lunch that costs more than your usual fast food or sandwich, I'd still be a spoiled fool to act like 55 cents meant nothing.  She came back and basically said ""I'm sorry about that, but we raised our prices and our system is in transition is that okay?"" Nooo it's not okay to be lied to about this. I told her no and she went and told the manager. The manager came back and told us the same thing. First off, this shouldn't have been an issue to begin with; they should have correct pricing on all their menus at all times. Second, they should have corrected the error for us immediately. Third, you should never tell a customer some excuse and still make the customer responsible for it. I told him as such and he just looked at me and shook his head as if to say ""sorry you don't like it but tough luck we won't change it for you."" Sure enough, they didn't change it on the bill they brought back. This is misrepresentation and illegal. You're lucky we didn't walk out completely.  I mean here's the bottom line: YOU squabbled with a customer for 55 cents. You lost a customer. OVER 55 CENTS. Petty, petty restaurant. Oh and I forgot to mention, on our way to the parking two valets nearly backed into us! Part 2: This is actually a prequel to today's fiasco. A few months ago a friend and I went to eat here. Her and my favorite appetizer is the avocado eggroll plate. We ordered a plate of them but were told they were out of avocado even though we saw other plates of food being served with avocado. It must have been another issue with the eggrolls themselves but either way we were very disappointed. Now some background - I live a half hour away from this Cheesecake Factory so to go there is a special trip. A week later I called and asked specifically if they now had avocado eggrolls in stock and available to order to go. The person on the phone said ""we sure do!"" very confidently. So I took a trip down there, I went in and went to the to go counter to order, and they told me they still didn't have them available. This had me steaming. Obviously no one in this restaurant commmunicates with each other. Well I went home and wrote a complaint through the website. A while later I got an apology letter and a gift card from the manager. I figured at this point that at least the communication problem would have been addressed. So a week later I call, and I ask the same thing. They tell me the same thing they did when I called before: ""we sure do have them available!"" Well guess what? I drive down there and they're still unavailable. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE!? You can probably guess how upset I was, and of course I complained online again. I didn't get a response for a couple of months in the form of a letter from the manager asking me to call him. Well I kept calling and every day someone told me that he had 'just' left. Yeah right. Just awful, I'm done.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fresno?start=80,3.28,3.23,3.36,2.5000000000000004,3.25

When it came to customer service everyone was friendly and attentive to our needs.

When I asked for plastic silverware after my food was brought, I put my hand out to grab them from my waitress she put them right on the table ugh:-| defeated the purpose of me asking smh, I just wiped my fork off and prayed for the best.

141,Amy G.,"Fresno, CA",0,14,4.0,1.0,2017-12-07,"Today was supposed to be an enjoyable holiday meal with my department from work at this establishment. Sadly, it was a very disappointing visit. My department decided to have our holiday department luncheon with a large party of 15 on a time limit. I decided to order the skinny chicken pot pie. When it arrived, there were only two tiny pieces of chicken in that whole platter full of gravy.  I called the waitress over to inform and show her my plate and asked if they could at least put a few more pieces of chicken. The waitress returned from the kitchen and said the chef told her there was enough chicken and returned my plate to me (nothing was added).  I then asked for a different item but that wasn't any better because it took extra long for it to come out. By the time it came out,  my team was finishing eating their dessert so I asked for the plate to go.  My team was already eating dessert at this point so I asked the waitress if they could at least throw in a piece of cheesecake since they took so long to bring out the new plate and for the fact that I didn't get to enjoy my meal with my team. The manager came back and said no, he would not offer a free piece of cheesecake.   Now, normally I wouldn't mind being told no but this manager was very rude and spoke to me in an angry tone. The Cheesecake Factory is not cheaply priced and you would expect more from a reputable place to recitify a failure on their part to provide decent service even if just a simple apology.  I've had many years in customer service management and know how management should conduct themselves in business. This was very unprofessional and any manager who speaks to their customers in this tone should not be a manager. I will be contacting corporate office and anyone else I need to to let them know just how poorly Garry Choi conducted himself. Myself, my family and my coworkers will no longer be taking any business back to this Cheesecake Factory. They did not take the meal off the tag because ""I was given food.""

Get the fish tacos, the fish is a little big for the tortilla, but the flavors make up for portion. Felt full at the end of the meal, and splurged on cheesecake anyway. Try either an acidic dessert like the lemon meringue cheesecake, or go with a nice cool refreshing one like their layered tiramisu.

156,Jack B.,"San Francisco, CA",23,17,5.0,1.0,2018-01-11,"I would give this restaurant a zero if I could but I guess a 1 star would suffice. Last night was my son's 18th birthday and for some odd reason he chose to want to have dinner at Cheesecake Factory. We were a party of 9 (7 adults and 2 preteens.) At this point we have been waiting at least 15 to 20 mins which is not unreasonable so my wife and I chose to head to the bar and get cocktails before we were seated. As we see our party getting escorted to our table we noticed it was a table for a party of 8. So we informed the hostess that we needed a table for 9. Unfortunately, she was insisting that 9 people can fit even though there was only a setting for 8 with no room to put a 9th person anywhere. We insisted that she find us a table for 9. She was walking around for several minutes and with no success she claims she could not find a table for us when it shows it was not a busy night when numerous tables were open. We asked for the manager on duty and my wife spoke to him. After stating our concern he informed us that we can either wait longer because there is no table available for 9 people despite numerous tables being open or we can walk out. This manager's name is Brian, at least that is what he claims it to be. Very unprofessional. Not a good way to keep customers wanting to come back. Needless to say we ended up celebrating my son's 18th birthday elsewhere. Cheesecake Factory lost at least 7 repeat customers and for that evening lost over $300 in revenue. If this is how Cheesecake factory chooses to treat its customers consider this individual and family never to return to any cheesecake factory. I hope corporate leaders look at this incident seriously and not just brush it under the rug like what most huge corporations do. Mr. Jose Jimenez, if you truly care about customer service you need to deal with this shift manager and show him how to deal with customers professionally and not be a pompous ass. Also, the front staff need to learn how to pay attention to detail so that there's no repeat of this egregious behavior with other customers. I seriously hope that you being the general manager of a popular restaurant chain that you discipline this shift manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fresno,2.96,3.07,3.164,,3.026
