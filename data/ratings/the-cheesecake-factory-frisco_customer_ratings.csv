213,Preston M.,"Dallas, TX",229,151,27.0,4.0,2012-01-25,"After a few hours in the mall, nothing is better for the soul than cheesecake. Our server had an interesting communication style that was slightly awkward, but that certainly didn't take away from the fact that he was friendly, fast, and made sure we had plenty of water and tea. We started with our personal favorite, the fried macaroni and cheese. So delicious. I could just eat these all day instead of actual food. Because it was lunch and I wasn't in the mood for too much food, I got the lunch pizza and a Caesar salad. I opted for the white pizza, which is covered in delicious white cheese and spinach. It was good, and there was enough that I took some home and had a good snack the next day. We did have to wait for quite a while to be seated, but it was Sunday at around 1:30-2:00, so it was going to be pretty packed.  We finished the meal with some white macadamia nut cheesecake, which is exactly as delicious as it sounds.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-frisco?start=220,3.4,3.4,3.4,3.504,3.4000000000000004
187,Brandi G.,"Longview, TX",33,28,23.0,4.0,2012-03-02,This is by far my favorite place to eat in Frisco. The fried zucchini is the best. Period. We are big fans of the Fettuccine Alfredo and the Fish and Chips. In fact- I haven't had anything here that was bad. It's all good. Nothing disappoints! The only reason I took a star away is the seating here is horrendous. There is just my husband and I and they constantly try and sit us in the middle seats where you are stuck listening to everyone else conversation. They don't ask if you prefer table or booth.

The only thing that we did not really like was that when they box up your food to go, they take it out of your sight... could that be done at the table?

A few tips: --Did not like the Vietnamese Tacos appetizer --their beet and goat cheese salad appetizer is good for someone with a small appetite and priced nicely at around $5. --I didn't realize this until a waiter gave me the stink eye but waiters split their tips with support staff, so I think they only get to keep like 60% of it. Normally I tip really well, but this one particular time I only tipped like 13% despite good service because I was confused about TX tax rate versus CA tax rate which is closer to 10%.

I have always loved Cheesecake Factory, and this is a nice location. Clean, quick service and nice. There is typically not a wait for the table unless it's dinnertime on the weekends.. ((Which is maybe 5 minutes.))   I love that my water is always refilled and they offer to sprinkle parmesan cheese on our dishes. Nice touch! Free bread as appetizer and it has been warm and delicious every time I have visited Cheesecake Factory Frisco. Note: SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT. I make this mistake every time- I fill up on dinner and forget what Cheesecake Factory is known for.. the cheesecake. Save room for dessert!   Favorites on the Menu: Herb Crusted Salmon paired with the Steak because it is DELICIOUS and a nice portion. I can split with my husband no problem. The mashed potatoes are AMAZING and asparagus is ok. Plenty of food there and a nice bang for your buck. Pizza!!! Surprisingly the pizza here is absolutely delicious. It was not my first choice to order but my son loves pizza so I had a bite of his. WOW. THAT WAS GOOD! I have tried the pepperoni and also the veggie. The pizza is a thin crust style with flavorful cheeses and sauce. So great Cheesecake Factory I am impressed.  So-So dishes are the salads..  Cheesecakes: The cheesecakes are divine. GIANT! You get your $$ worth. You cannot go wrong ordering any of these. They come with thick whipped cream topping which I love to add to my coffee.  Cheesecake favorite is the Godiva Dark Chocolate. Makes my mouth water just typing that. HA! Warning. This is a VERY rich cheesecake. I could only handle about 3 bites and had to take the rest to go.

The environment is great, for the most part. We where sat at a table that was just too close for comfort to the tables next to us.  The menu is huge, a staggering 21 pages of choice. On top of that, it has advertisements scattered throughout.  I ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich, it came with coleslaw and French fries. A standard request. It all came out delicious, except the pork. It wasn't just smothered in BBQ sauce, it was like a sloppy joe. It just wasn't good.

It can't. The cheesecake is just about the only thing to write home about, and that's not too hard to master in my mind.  Even the service is rushed, there are so many employees running around it's hard to ever get your servers attention and it never ever feels like a personal experience, rather someone to fill the booth and pay the check until the next butts can slide in.

The service was excellent. Our server (and the bartender) was laid back and easy to deal with and we got out order pretty quickly. He started getting pretty busy in the fourth quarter and more guests was coming in so we had to wait a bit for our check which is understandable.  The food was standard. I notice a lot of reviews mentioned the Thai Lettuce Wraps was delicious. I didn't think they were THAT great... I prefer P. F. Chang's any day of the week. The small tapas beet and goat cheese salad was great. The other tapas apps were pretty good and small sized; perfect for us since we always over order. The BBQ pizza was kinda blah. Not what I had expected. The tiramisu and cherry cheesecake was a hit, but we couldn't finish it all because we were so stuffed.

186,Pam D.,"Frisco, TX",3,62,4.0,4.0,2013-06-24,"I enjoy coming here for a nice environment, knowing that I will have great service, and lots to choose from-- although I have noticed I order the same 5 dishes over and over again, but the opportunity is there to shake it up a bit.  The thai lettuce wraps are my favorite when I want to go healthy. I can usually get 2-3 meals out of this. I prefer Cheesecake Factory (CF) over PF Chang. CF's wraps are made with whole pieces of chicken...you know you are getting real whole chicken. PF Chang's is made from ground chicken-- which means you don't know what else is in it. My friend confirmed it when he told me that when he worked at PF Chang's they would put whole chunks of fat and left over chicken parts in the meat grinder to make the dish.  I also like the white bean chicken chili. It is spicy and filling. Perfect for the fall and winter. Unfortunately, this isn't as big of a serving as their other dishes. I will usually eat this in one sitting with just a tiny bit left over... too tiny to ask for a to-go container. I am not a big cheesecake eater, but the dulce de leche cheesecake is awesome and doesn't taste like cheesecake. It tastes like silky caramel. I also like the Chris' Outragous Chocolate Cake but it is so rich that I can't have more than a few bites. For babies, they will bring out a free baby plate with slices of their bread and slices of bananas. Sometimes they will bring it out on their own, sometimes you have to ask for it. This is awesome because me a chance to get settled in and look over the menu. If I could change one thing, it's the sticky and many times slick floors. It seems like there is always a layer of grease, sauce, or something on the floor and I have to be careful when I walk to make sure I don't slip. Try doing that while holding a baby, holding another kid's hand, having a diaper bag slung over your shoulder with a purse on top of it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-frisco?start=240,3.2,3.2,3.2,3.024,3.2000000000000006
218,Renee S.,"Dallas, TX",0,29,,1.0,2013-07-07,"My son took me to here at this location on Friday July 5 for my birthday. Awful experience. We were seated along an area near the kitchen. It was incredibly noisy but, we decided to stay. Our server looked rushed and harried. When we noticed a kid screaming at an extremely high pitch over and over, when the waitress came over once again, I asked if that table would be leaving soon. She said she didn't hear it. Then the kid screamed again....I mean who lets their children scream like that...ever! Anyhoo, she didn't know anything she was very disconnected. I asked for a manager.  When he came, I asked about the screaming, to which he appeared dumbfounded especially when I said I would prefer not to eat in a nursery. Anyway, he offered to move us to another booth, which was quieter.  Now when we moved, he carried our appetizer but we had to carry our drinks. Fine, but then we were brought our meals sooooo fast, no time to enjoy our appetizer with the wine we ordered.  My meal I have had countless times. Never was it so spicy that it was uncomfortable to eat. I just wanted out of there so I said nothing and had it packed for home. My son's ahi tuna was excellent and that was what the one star is for. The worst part? I came home and realized I left my pills on the first table!  They didn't bother to notice and bring them over when we moved! What terrible inconsideration. For shame.  This place is extremely noisy, rushed, and the staff are so busy I guess.

We'd already waited an hour for our food, so the send back was a huge issue.  By the time it came back out, my husband was done, and I'd munched on sweet potato fries until I was full.  I picked at it and that was it.  It was a 20 dollar entree. The manager came over and apologized and offered a free dessert.  What a disappointment.  I have a newly discovered dairy allergy and they have not one single dessert I could share with my husband. So you think they'd at least offer to comp HALF the meal at least... NO... they offered nothing more that a free dessert I can't have.  Do you think I want to come back here?

Yeah I know - its a chain; it's a circus during dinner on the weekends;and they don't advertise their calorie counts.  I have to admit, though, every time I've been here, I've had good, solid service; good food; and best of all, good drinks (their strawberry martinis are a bit pricey but they are THE BEST).  Yes, I believe in supporting locally owned businesses, but Cheesecake Factory fills a niche. Have a large party with picky eaters? Take em to the Cheesecake Factory. If you can't find anything you'd like to eat on their menu, then you need to stay at home.  My favorites are - Avocado Eggrolls, Pot Stickers, Herb Crusted Salmon, Shrimp Scampi, and their burgers are pretty darn good too. Did I mention Strawberry Martinis? Their Lemon Drop martini is pretty darn tasty too. The portions are huge (which means you can take it HOME!) and are good if you want to share with a large group.  Every kind of cheesecake I've tried here has been delicious (my favorites are Vanilla Bean, Oreo, and White Chocolate Raspberry) and worth the Spin class I'll have to go to in order to burn it off.  So yes, I'll continue to eat here - and the fact that most of them are attached to malls also helps. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-frisco?start=200,3.08,3.08,3.08,3.088,3.0800000000000005

109,David B.,"Salt Lake City, UT",94,313,539.0,1.0,2013-11-17,"First I wanted to stop and think before writing this review. We have had a number of meals at other Cheesecake Factory's, and this was our first at this location. The service was abysmal, as it was obvious Joseph had no care for the customer, only a desire to increase his ticket total and turn the table.  He came up interrupting us even though the place was practically empty, not once or twice but consistently.   The food was no where near up to standard. We had to ask for bread, and once it was tossed onto the table, we found it to be ice cold, rock hard, and nothing like the normal quality warm yumminess the bread  usually has at others in the chain.  The artichoke was far from cooked properly as half of the vegetables normal edible area could not be pried off with a knife. I would have sent it back, but the next time our waiter returned it was with the Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, and at that point we had eaten enough it would have been inappropriate to send it back. The pasta sauce had a good flavor with plenty of vegetables, but the pasta tasted old like the stuff you get out of a dehydrated pack at the store with the word 'generic' on the wrapper.  The cost for the sodas at 2.95 was standard rate but a bit higher than it should be.  We were at table 212 ticket 0687 on 11/11 22:04.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-frisco?start=140,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.5960000000000005,3.1200000000000006

207,Heather C.,"Dallas, TX",0,4,,2.0,2013-11-29,"I've eaten at The Cheesecake Factory many times over the years since I first discovered them. This review is to reflect this specific location and not the company as a whole. I love TCF and not just for their wide variety of incredible cheesecakes. I love that they have such a large, diverse menu. It might make picking an appetizer and an entree a little difficult but I can find something there no matter what I'm craving and the food has always been excellent. I have no complaint about the menu or quality of the food. This location however is awful. Their staff is rude and unattentive. Service is SLOW. I mean abysmally slow. I'm the type to give a place more than one chance (unless my experience is just beyond wretched) because I understand that crap happens sometimes. However, three chances is my limit with places and all three times I've been to this location, I've had issues with staff attitude and service. First time I went in there was in the afternoon, they weren't busy but the hostess at the hostess station didn't acknowledge me as she was talking to a server. I walked up and said hello, she ignored me and kept chatting with the server. I said hello again only to be asked to hold on one moment. They were talking about so and so's baby shower so it wasn't an important work matter. After I was finally seated, my friend and I waited 10 minutes just to have a server appear to get out drinks then another 7 minutes to receive our iced teas. I can understand if they were busy and short of staff but they were not busy and there were servers standing around in corners chatting and not looking particularly busy. So there was no excuse for the amount of time getting iced teas took. The rest of the service went that way with out server disappearing for long stretches of time. I complained to a manager who didn't seem very concerned and wasn't very apologetic that it took us an hour and a half to get through a lunch on an afternoon that wasn't busy at all just because our server was taking long periods of time between stops at our table. A second trip there, this time in the evening for dinner, did not yield better results in terms of service. We were seated within the quoted time limit. It took our server about 5 minutes to stop by to tell us she would be right back to get our drink order. We waited 10 minutes for her to return. She took our drink order. A couple minutes later, no drinks in hand, she returned to tell us she was going on a break and someone else would be taking over our table. We waited another 10 minutes and had to get a manager to get a server and some drinks to our table. Our new server was rude and impatient and seemed bothered by having to answer questions about certain menu items. After dropping off our food, we had to flag the new server down to order more drinks and get refills on water. Then before we were even halfway through our meals, we were being offered desserts and to-go containers.  This is the only Cheesecake Factory I've ever gone to and received such horrible service on multiple attempts at different times a day. I love the food and the variety there but will stick to avoiding coming to this location when I'm in the area. Which is when I'm shopping at Stonebriar Mall. It's unfortunate they have such bad service and management doesn't seem to really care to do anything to rectify it as a whole.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-frisco?start=220,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.6960000000000006,3.0800000000000005

193,Thomas W.,"Plano, TX",10,442,,4.0,2014-01-06,"Cheesecake Factory is one of those places you go to when you want to fool yourself into thinking you're living the high life for a second, without going broke doing it. That is to say, it has a thin veneer of upscale elements, but the affordability of restaurants like Chili's and T.G.I. Friday's. Kind of like a Cadillac Cimarron. The restaurant is very nice. Polished stone floors, moody lighting and displays with cheesecakes, obviously.  How's the food you ask? Unfortunately, this is where the restaurant shares more in common with other casual dining options like Chili's and T.G.I. Friday's. Just like those chains, the food here does not really rely upon finesse to taste good, but rather the crude standbys of more salt, more sugar, and more oil. With this technique you can probably make a fried turd taste good. (Note the popularity of Chinese food in America? It is not only very salt and oily, but also sweet.) Good food also involves the texture, the temperature and the spices. Can't forget the spices. So their food is basically pretty mediocre and only a few notches better than most casual dining chains. The cheesecake is pretty good though. Not too sweet and somewhat fluffy. Service is inattentive.

148,Zach P.,"Forney, TX",1,22,2.0,3.0,2014-08-09,"Went for my sisters birthday. The food wasn't bad,  some plates were better than others which  is expected from any place just based on taste buds and personal preference. I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich,  and I really wasn't impressed much. Not surprising I guess because it's not a BBQ place but since people usually say that everything is good at the cheesecake factory I thought I would try it.  It was just pulled pork mixed with BBQ sauce on what looked like a wheat bun,  with fries and slaw (which was sub-par).  The fries were good though :)  My wife had the skinny chicken enchiladas and she said they weren't good. The waitress suggested something else (a different enchilada plate) which was more expensive so I was under the impression that she  was just trying to up sell which is why we stuck with our first pick.  My dad, on the other hand had a pasta plate,  some Chipotle pasta.  The flavor of that was awesome!  Seriously... I would definitely try that out. You really can't go wrong with that plate.  We all finished with the obvious cheesecake. I had the vanilla bean which was alright. I was sold on the ""mousse""  in the description but it really wasn't that great. I expected mousse like chocolate mousse but I just wasn't impressed. I would have rather stuck with the original cheesecake or quite simply nothing.  I say nothing only because I was full from the bread and dinner itself. It's just a lot of food- not complaining,  just saying...  Overall not a bad experience. Waitress was nice and made the experience fun.  She was working a double but you couldn't tell because she was great!   It is a high traffic restaurant.  I will say that! So if you end up waiting for food,  don't ask why.  Overall wait to get our food wasn't bad.  The only thing was that we had to ask for bread because it didn't seem like we were going to get any if we hadn't asked.  No big deal though... My only complaint is that they wouldn't take reservation. We were a party of 7 but no reservations could be made...

As soon as I stepped through the front doors I remembered why I had avoided it for so long.  The wait time for this place is crazy. For a lunch for 2 on a Wednesday, I had to wait almost 20 mins. I tried not to think about it too much because maybe it was just the convenience of the restaurant that made it so crowded (located right inside Stonebriar Mall).  When we were first greeted by our server it was great. She was very upbeat as she took our drink orders. It all went downhill from there. She took about ten minutes to bring out the drinks and even more time to come take our orders. I guess that was okay, since the menu is SO ridiculously long. There was 4 pages of small plates/appetizers, like 6 pages of entrees, and another 3 pages for desserts. Trying way too hard to incorporate too many different things. We ended up ordering the Ahi Tuna Tartare as an appetizer, and the Shepard's Pie and the Herb-Crusted Salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus as an entree. Tartare was the best part of the whole meal. Shepard's pie was good. The salmon was flavorless, but cooked very well. It was really juicy, which almost made up for the lack of flavor (after I added salt).  PROS: Tuna Tartare (why this review got two stars) and nothing else.

124,Wai Y.,"Dallas, TX",307,301,353.0,3.0,2015-02-09,"Food (***) Average chain restaurant food. Nothing great but nothing bad either. Light colored bread was cold & hard crusty. Brown bread was soft & tasty but also cold. Butter was prepackaged not creamed in house. Dishes were timid. Spicy dishes were mild. Typical chain restaurant, afraid to offend anyone, but wowing nobody. If you want fire, ask for it. Crab cakes were not 90-100% crab, only about 40-50% crab, but were good. All cheesecake are superb, especially the strawberry cheesecake, very creamy. For some reason, this location consistently has trouble cooking food that requires the chef to judge when something is done. Medium well hamburgers always turn out well done, french fries are soggy, fried fish still has gooey batter, etc. Even good reviews of the Cheescake factory point out how stuff is cooked wrong. Look at the photo of the salmon in LIly T's glowing review. Notice how the salmon is white not pink. Salmon should be cooked until the center is just fully cooked but still pink and moist inside instead of dry and white. However, their pasta dishes are good. You can over cook or under cook pasta by a minute or two and it will still be acceptable. Their Bistro Shrimp Scampi is probably the best in town. It has lots of garlic, which is just the way I like it. Also, every time I send something back to the kitchen, it turns out perfect the 2nd time around.  Service (****) Usually good but ocassionally very slow & bad. It was really good today. One waiter only, no waiter teams. Atmosphere (***) Bland, loud, typical chain restaurant. Ask for privacy booths for a better more quiet dining experience.

I feel like if you go to a big chain restaurant then you should expect really good food not rubber noodles and watered down alfredo sauce. I understand the kitchen can get busy and for us to have one item of our meal to be bad that is fine but for multiple items at the same table while everyone around us is enjoying perfectly cooked food....that's unacceptable.

Before you unfriend me, I'm all about eating local and supporting the mom and pop joints, but sometimes it's simply a matter of convenience.  Hence the other night when I was in Frisco for work, exhausted, and wanted something close to the hotel so that my coworker and I could grab a bite and promptly get back to our rooms and crash.  The thing they have going for them is consistency. I like to order from their skinny menu and have yet to find a dish off if that I didn't care for. I've enjoyed the white chicken chili, both the Asian and Mexican chicken lettuce tacos, flatbreads, and small appetizers. This visit I was craving a salad so I got the skinny Cobb without the blue cheese crumbles.  It came with perfectly grilled chicken, chopped bacon, corn, avocado, romaine, and a light vinaigrette dressing. They top it with fresh herbs and it hit the spot for me in terms of freshness and taste. I would most definitely order that again.  My coworker got the herbed salmon off the regular menu and asked for broccoli instead of potatoes. Her plate looked great as well. Of course we couldn't leave without dessert, so we each got our own slice of cheesecake too and coffee to end the meal. (Can I get an amen for per diems?!) I always browse the cheesecake menu like I plan to try something new, but end up ordering the dulce de leche. Can't help it, it's my favorite! I ate half before my stomach raised the white flag. That was the most sugar I'd had in a while but worth every bite.  She got the smores cheesecake which I'd never heard of before. It's a chocolate cheesecake that they cover in a torched marshmallow cream and serve with fresh whipped cream and graham crackers. It looked gorgeous and while I didn't try a bite of the actual cheesecake (have to be in the mood for chocolate), I did try the marshmallow cream and it was divine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-frisco?start=40,3.2,3.34,3.34,3.024,3.2840000000000007

My friends were surprised that I was able to finish everything because I'm apparently ""tiny"" and the rest of my friends packed up all of their food to go.

The only thing that changed is that they offer a ""healthy menu"" which includes many low calorie options for those who are choosing a healthier lifestyle. The healthy menu included drinks, appetizers, entrees, and dessert with the amount of calories next it.  The customer service is great as well.  I ordered the ""Skinnylicious chicken pasta"" which was surprisingly good for it being only being 540 calories. I was very satisfied with the good decision that I decided to make which later took a toll. I ordered the Smores' Cheesecake and the Oreo Cheesecake (I was sharing so don't worry lol). The Oreo cheesecake was absolutely amazing and I STRONGLY recommend everyone to try it if you're indecisive. You wont regret it! The Oreo Cheesecake contained a great combination of texture (from the actual cookie) and the cheesecake itself. It was the best 5 minutes of my life! The smore's cheesecake was too rich for me and I honestly couldn't differentiate between the melted marshmallow and white cream. I enjoyed it as well but my go-to would be the Oreo choice.

There really is something for everyone. I opted for a giant breakfast sandwich on brioche with ham and bacon and egg and cheese. Incredibly filling and pretty tasty, but greasy. Exactly what I expected, in other words. My kiddo had corn dogs with a side of fruit and milk. Typical kids meal. The fruit was cut into non-choking hazard pieces, which I appreciated.

Be careful though because even though some of the items are low in calorie, they are still high in sodium and fat. I ordered the steak medallions from the lighter menu for my dinner. They were pretty good. It wasnt an amazing cut of meat but it had a good flavor. The asparagus was cooked well but there wasnt much of it. There was a little too much of the red wine sauce. they could have gone a little lighter there. But overall a decent meal for $16.95. The noise level is really loud and there are a lot of kids.

97,Stewart P.,"Birmingham, AL",120,269,79.0,3.0,2016-01-29,"I am a fan of one thing and one thing only at The Cheesecake Factory: the cheesecake. I have eaten at many locations across the country and while they are consistent, the food is bland, boring and overpriced. With that said, I did not dine here during this visit, only ran in quickly for a piece of sweet fromage to take back to my hotel room after eating at another restaurant nearby. So, to be fair, I am only reviewing the service I received and my cheesecake.  I'll start off with the wonderful part - the cheesecake. It was good. Okay, really good. Now, I've have better, artisan cheesecake that tasted like heaven and cost 5 times as much as this but let's be honest, this is the one thing that TCF does well in honoring its namesake. I ordered the red velvet cake and it was sweet, creamy and large enough that I passed half of it off as breakfast the next morning. You can do that when you're significant other is hundreds of miles away..... The location is a bit odd. It is located in a mall, which is likely the reason it is so crowded all the time, but it doesn't make for the nicest location for those who want to grab and go. I entered through the mall (I believe there is also an outside entrance) and was met with a long line of people who were waiting for acknowledgement from the hostess. I only wanted some cheesecake so it was quite obnoxious that I had to fight for an opening to get to the cheesecake display that was moronically located right next to the host desk where everyone congregates. There was no line for the cheesecake but fighting through the crowd took some time and then getting someone's attention took another 5 minutes or so. I did that annoying throat-clearing trick to get someone to look my way but they are like my children and have selective hearing. The service at this location left a bit to be desired. The person who did eventually help me looked at me with disdain, as if I was just another person plaguing the world with my quest for diabetes. The assessment would not have been wholly inaccurate but still, it would be nice for them to fake it a bit better. We exchanged money and cake with not so much as a grunt of human friendliness from their end. I'm sticking with my assessment that TCF is a cruddy place to eat anything other than cheesecake.... but once in a while you need that cheesy goodness, and this is a decent place as any to get it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-frisco?start=80,3.64,3.32,3.32,3.0200000000000005,3.4480000000000004

68,Nicole M.,"Plano, TX",153,44,157.0,1.0,2016-02-14,"We're no strangers to Cheesecake Factory.  We love the flagship in Macy's San Francisco (we always do the Kobe Burger there), always did brunch in Waikiki (and loved the ahi tempura roll that's no longer on the menu), and it was our go to in the Woodlands when Mia was first born.  We have always had a great experience and looked forward to coming back. This location at Stonebriar in Plano, however, is the exception and has taken a poor experience to a whole new level.  Some weeks ago, my husband and I got some precious time away and thought to treat ourselves to some QT and cheesecake.  As all the other tables were served around us (although some had been seated far after we had ordered), we expressed our concern which was met wit a somewhat exasperated ""I'll check on it."" And the delivery of barely lukewarm food. It was not was we had hoped to dive into after 45 minutes of waiting--and no, there was no line.  My family had been warning me that service and food quality had been declining, but I refused to believe that an establishment with such a good reputation would be falling apart. And then today happened  It's Valentine's Day, and after church, I thought it would be sweet for us to brunch as a family. It was early, so I thought Cheesecake Factory would be a good choice. It took us 15 minutes to be seated, and our server, Patrick, was very sweet if a little harried.  This is where is goes downhill. We waited over 20 minutes again for our food, and they brought out my toddler's food (pancakes and bacon).  Another 7 minutes later, our food appeared. My husband had the Benedict with breakfast potatoes. Not only was the dish lukewarm, the potatoes were almost black from being overlooked. And then there was my Chorizo and Avocado omelette.  It looked pretty, and I cut into it.  Green peppers, chorizo....and no avocado. How does a main ingredient get left out?! I apprised our sever and a manger brogue out a replacement a few minutes later with three sad pieces of avocado stuffed inside the omelette and now, NO SOUR CREAM on the omelette. I was done. I was livid. And then and there, I realized that the poor service was not a one off, it was an indication of what was happening in their business. Maybe you can get away with it when people are willing to wait 90 minutes to get a table since there is nowhere else to eat in the mall. But if someone is will to wait 90 minutes, they'd should be deserving of at least decent service and food quality as opposed to what our experiences have been the last few times. I spoke to James, the manager, and he has only been here since November. He seems passionate about what he does, and I hope he has the ability to address this sinking service that reflects poorly on the rest of the organization.   If you are considering this location, please take my advice and reconsider.

I have to say I was a little disappointed. We split an order of fried calamari and and order of fish tacos. The serving sizes here are huge. The calamari was pretty good and we gobbled it up, but afterwards, we were both pretty full already. When the server came with the fish tacos, we found out that an order of fish tacos was 4 fish tacos and rice and beans (we ended up taking half of it home). The fish tacos though were not as good as we expected. The fish itself was very bland and the guacamole inside the tacos was very flavorless as well. The fish tacos came with a side of rice and a side of black beans but the rice was extremely sour -- it literally just tasted like lime to me. After mixing in the beans with it, it was a lot better, but I was still a little disappointed I couldn't just eat the rice on its own.

There weren't a lot of people ahead of me, but apparently writing down someone's name and party size is hard and takes a long time. I was told the wait time would be 1 hour and 10 minutes for our party of 5. The lobby here is tiny and there is no place to sit and wait, so had to sit on the floor of the entrance to the mall. After an hour and a half, we were walked past several large empty tables and given a table for 4 (reminder there were 5 of us). After 10 minutes, our waitress came to take our orders. We placed our order and asked for some bread, as we had been now waiting an hour and 40 minutes. After 15 minutes, the waitress came with our drinks but no bread. Asked again for some bread. After another 15 minutes, the waitress came with my wife's appetizer. Asked again for our bread (every other table was given bread promptly). After another 15 minutes, our entrees came out - still no bread. We have now been here for 2 hours and 25 minutes. I imagine the bread is made continuously and the waitress just has to grab it and bring it to your table. We asked the food runner who brought us our entrees for some bread and she had it out to us within 2 minutes. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. My plate was burning hot and the spaghetti looked and tasted like it was made the day before, refrigerated, then microwaved and served to me. Our inept waitress never came back to check on us, although after waiting for some 3 hours, I was too hungry to waste time sending back my entree. More waiting while our glacial waitress very slowly brought the check and processed the payment. Not sure why I need to leave a tip at all since our waitress just takes our orders and enters it into a computer (something I could do myself if they allowed it).

It literally tastes like slightly sweetened black coffee with a kick. Although it is good, it is not worth $11.25. That's pretty pricey in my opinion. The cheesecakes are literally the best.

When I called the store to talk to someone about this, I was called a liar and was told that this waitress would not do such a thing by the finance manager of the store.

31,Lindsy H.,"Allen, TX",429,707,1284.0,4.0,2016-11-07,"(3.5 stars rounded up) I've never frequented The Cheesecake Factory, but since moving to Dallas I find myself there more often. The service is usually pretty great. I've only experienced lame service at the front door. About 50% of my visits are with my two little ones and not once has anyone helped me with the door. They literally sit at the hostess stand and watch me struggle trying to open TWO sets of heavy doors and maneuver my stroller in. Oh and they watch me struggle again when I leave. The menu is VAST, but everything I've had (see below) has tasted pretty great. The prices continue to rise, which is unfortunate, because it's not a fine dining establishment, and it also keeps me from making this a ""regular"" in my rotation.  ------- Thai Lettuce Wraps - a great small meal or an appetizer to share. Either way they're tasty. Chinese Chicken Salad - lots of wontons and rice noodles, I'd ask for 1/2 the amount they usually put on. The dressing is the best part! Oh, the chicken is chilled, not warm. Old Fashioned Burger & Classic Burger - both really juicy and tasty, without being too greasy. I could take or leave the bun, and the fries are pretty yummy, although there could be more :) Cheesecake: *Try the low carb cheesecake, it's really yummy! It has almond crust instead of graham cracker. *Adam's PB Cup Fudge Ripple is SUPER rich and yet oh so good. *Dulce De Leche is also really sweet, but also good. But my go-to, the one I crave is the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake - YES please!

While our service was good, it took us FOREVER to get our food! We all got an entree each and it was 40 minutes. Our waitress apologized but we were hungry!!! Anyways, the food was ok for the wait. I do think it's more of a dessert place. Like get some cheesecake but maybe not eat dinner.  Yeah, that's my only gripe. Also if you're a first timer, the menu is overwhelming like others have said.

I come here way too much and spend way too much of my money here because the food is so freaking good! It concerns me just a little though that they don't list nutritional facts on their website... how much fat/salt and sugar am I really getting? Well, if I am concerned I guess I can go for the Super Antioxidant Salad with spinach, kale, avocado, broccoli, grapes, pear, blueberries, red onion, sunflower seeds, almonds and a lemon-blueberry vinaigrette. The dressing is paired perfectly with the salad- you have to have something to balance out the bitter taste of kale, and this dressing does the trick! All of the lettuce types in the salad appeared fresh and I did not find any of those nasty brown mushy old pieces I sometimes find in salads. The fruit and vegetables in the salad were also fresh and the salad as a whole tasted great!  My other go-to when I am not trying to be ""healthy"" is the Baja Chicken Taco dish. Mmmmmm, comes with small corn tortillas, chicken, a yummy mildly spicy orange cream sauce, cheese, avocado, cilantro, onions and tomatoes. The dish comes with black beans and a cilantro rice. They give you two corn tortillas per taco, comes with four tacos, because of the yummy sauce that drips everywhere and can make the first tortilla weak. You can get a tad messy when eating the tacos but that is what the napkin is for.  Bang-Bang chicken and shrimp is also delicious! They use a coconut curry sauce that is not spicy at all, with thinly sliced zucchini, peanuts, yellow squash, carrots, peas, shallots, ginger, and shredded coconut on top of the rice. They have brown or white rice, I prefer the brown. The shrimp is always cooked well and has a good grilled flavor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-frisco?start=80,2.96,3.31,3.31,2.9320000000000004,3.17

He left the table without bringing us more bread or refilling our drinks. It took another twenty minutes to bring my boyfriend his chicken strips, at which point I had already finished my meal (it was either that or let it get cold while we waited--my boyfriend insisted I eat).

The location is always poppin as well and it isn't too far from my home which is perfect. It's also located in the mall so after eating too much you can just walk it off by strolling the mall.  My number one go to item is the fried Mac and cheese. It is the best appetizer they have and honestly if you aren't starving you can eat all four of the as a meal. But if you come to cheesecake make sure you try this! You won't regret it.  They're food is always very good and they're always adding new items every now and then. The only problem I have is that the menu is so big that I get overwhelmed sometimes. But one of my favorite entrees is the chicken maderia! Especially if you like mushrooms. The service here is also always on point. They definitely work for their money.  Now to the cheesecake. My two favorites are 30th anniversary and red velvet but they have a bunch of other options to try from as well. Honestly you can't go wrong with any of them.

Update:  read the response from the restaurant.  While I appreciate them taking the time to respond, the response was puzzling.  The primary issue was the slow, inefficient service that took us 2 hours from the time we sat down to order until we left the restaurant, not my youngest son's reaction to the novel-like menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-frisco?start=40,3.0,3.1,3.284,2.472,3.0600000000000005

Not horrendous, but definitely not what you'd expect when their ""RECOMMENDED"" gratuity is freakin 22% (on receipt). My parents are visiting, so we decided try out The Cheesecake Factory located next to Dave and Buster's, since we planned on ending our night playing games and it would be their first time dining here.  The wait was not long at all, 15 min tops.  Customer service was very lackluster. Our server was Ian. He was nice, not abrupt like some horrible servers, but he lacked attentiveness and personality or was not personable.  The most upsetting part was the FOOD. We waited at least 45 minutes for our food.  Ian stopped at our table once in that time to let us know he apologizes but the food is taking a bit longer than expected and he cleared our appetizer and bread plates. The food is finally delivered by a runner, not our server. Our food was COLD!!  He checks on us 5 minutes after we received our food and I asked what was the purpose of us waiting on our food for 45 minutes because all of our food was cold! The only thing that was warmer that cold was the middle of my potatoes! It was very discouraging because I hoped my parents would have enjoyed the experience here. Unfortunately, my dad definitely did not. All the fries on the kids plate and my dad shrimp plate were old and stale. My mother and I ordered chicken madeira. Our food was cold to the touch. There was hardly no cheese on our chicken which was very odd. The one corner of cheese we did find was on the end piece of one of the chix breast and it had already hardened from being cold. Overall, we loved our chicken madeira. The flavors on that is always wonderful. So our server did tell management and he recommended that he could recook everything fresh but we declined definitely because we had already waited 45 minutes for the food on top of having other plans after leaving from eating. He comped our 3 slices of cheesecake, but that is definitely not what I wanted. What I wanted was a delicious hot meal to enjoy with my family. Sad to say, money was lost here because I had plans on buying a gift card for my parents to go to the location in Tennessee and my father quickly declined!!!

Almond crusted salmon salad: It comes with more kale than salmon, as expected. Fortunately there is also creamy ripe avocado that can be mixed with the kale. Would taste a lot better with more salmon and some arugula.  Cajun chicken pasta: Best dish here. Most of the dishes I've had at Cheesecake are too creamy or bland, but this has a good Cajun kick and is not just covered in sauce. Shrimp Scampi: Do not get this. I'm a huge fan of shrimp scampi, and while it's true that this place is not an Italian place, I didn't think it would be that off. They used no lemon or white wine in this, and the shrimp was coated with flour and fried. The angel hair pasta was dry and flavorless. Everything about this was disappointing.

12,Raheem F.,"Garland, TX",5,28,33.0,4.0,2017-11-28,"I came here for the first time with a large group of people and overall it was a great experience. I ordered the Louisiana Chicken pasta which was really good and the chicken was seasoned well. I really liked the pasta sauce too, it was kind of like a Cajun alfredo sauce. To end the meal I ordered their Celebration cheesecake and it was a disappointment. Although it looks very appealing it just didn't taste like what they claimed to be a ""celebration"". It was more like a funeral to be honest. The flavors didn't go together and the cake part was kind of dry. I didn't even end up finishing it. However, I know they make plenty of other cheesecakes here so I'm bound to find one that I like! The service was amazing and the waiter was so funny and attentive. I know the menu is pretty big so I'm not going to let one menu item call it quits for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-frisco,2.92,3.09,3.216,,3.022
1,Melissa F.,"Brooklyn, NY",45,54,48.0,3.0,2017-11-30,"Grabbed a quick late night bite here and it was good! Our server Pasia was really sweet, (which always makes my experiences anywhere much more gratifying !!) and she was efficient. The fried mozzarella was good but we had to ask for the marinara sauce after we were served. It was odd that it didn't come on the plate. It also seemed they didn't care about the presentation of the food -- it looked a little messy  (see photo ). It was a good appetizer - nothing special but exactly what you expect from a chain restaurant.  My friend and I shared grilled steak medallions off the Skinnylicious menu. It was a perfect size for us wanting a small meal. We asked for it to be cooked medium and they cooked it just right. ----All around it was a satisfactory experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-frisco,2.84,3.09,3.216,,2.9899999999999998
39,Carly P.,"Frisco, TX",0,3,,2.0,2017-12-09,"l was very disappointed last night when l came in. l understand that it is a popular restaurant, and so it was very busy. But when they told us the wait was gonna be around an hour l thought that was fine and it was for my friends birthday so we stayed. comes almost 2 hours later, we asked about our table and they said it was almost ready. waiting about 30 more minutes we ask again and finally get to sit down. by this time it was 9:00 and we had gotten there around 6:30. Our waiter was nice and made we sure always had bread and refills, but the service was slow, and our food took forever. Seems like they put adults and families before teenagers, which isn't what l like to see in a restaurant, especially after waiting over 2 hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-frisco?start=20,2.84,3.08,3.208,,2.9840000000000004

14,Andy D.,"Coppell, TX",0,4,,2.0,2017-12-29,"I honestly do not understand the fascination with this restaurant.   On any given night there is a 30 to 45 minute wait.  The menu is huge but they don't do any of it well, especially considering the high prices.  Service is below average.  The only reason they get 2 stars from me is because the decor is better than Chillis and the cheesecake is excellent.  I suggest getting a better meal elsewhere and then ordering the cheesecake to take home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-frisco,2.92,3.01,3.196,,2.9739999999999998
