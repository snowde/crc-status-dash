483,Jadira R.,"Las Vegas, NV",326,425,2079.0,4.0,2012-01-12,"I came here in a group of 20 on a Sunday afternoon and we were very well accommodated. They sat us in a booth area with two side by side long tables. The only problem was that half of our group was running on Filipino time, so they were an hour late, but we didn't bother waiting because that always happens, so we just ordered all our food and appetizers. We got Thai lettuce wraps and calamari as appetizers. I split grilled salmon with my sister and my mom had fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and roasted tomatoes.  The Calamari came with Garlic Dip & Cocktail Sauce. The Calamari itself was crunchy and perfectly cooked. I really don't like getting cocktail sauce with Calamari, so I stuck with the garlic dip. The lettuce wraps were very large and came with strips of chicken satay. I kind of wish the chicken would be more chopped up though. It'd just make it easier for the lettuce wraps and make it so you can have more servings. They were very good though. It came with a lot of toppings which were all very fresh. The Grilled Salmon was delicious! It was a big portion and more than enough to split between me and my sister ( ). We ordered mashed potatoes and green beans for our sides, but they have lots of other ones to choose from. Everything was perfectly cooked and so flavorful. It's definitely one of my favorite dishes here now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=700,3.6,3.56,3.56,3.6,3.5760000000000005

1014,Pete S.,"Glendale, CA",3,44,10.0,5.0,2012-01-27,"It really shocks me when someone tells me they're not a fan of Cheesecake Factory. Seriously? how could you not be when they have such a HUGE menu to choose from? There's gotta be something on there that you'll like ;) One of my friends who used to hate Cheesecake Factory is a huge fan now after she started going with me and learning which dishes to order. I've tried many different items from the menu never once had a bad meal but my favorites would have to be the Endive Salad but it comes in small portions so i usually order 2 or 3 of them. Yeah It's that good. The fried calamari are so good and so are the Thai lettuce wraps and the firecracker salmon. Usually for a main course I like to order the grilled salmon special with broccoli and asparagus. It's the perfect meal, nice and light and not to mention this dish doesn't have tons of calories like so many other dishes on the menu. The Baja chicken tacos are really good too. Chicken madeira and their pasta dishes are also recommended. I've even tried this place for breakfast and was surprised to find out they have good omelets. Also, you can't forget about CHEESECAKE of course :P My personal favorites are the fresh banana cream and the brownie sundae.

She was very sweet and was very accommodating when I couldn't decide on a wine she was honest and told me she wasn't sure exactly which type of wine was the best fit for what I was describing so she quickly went to the bartender and she came back with exactly the taste I was looking for!

1091,Deedee F.,"Las Vegas, NV",51,32,6.0,2.0,2012-02-19,"My husband I went there for a Valentine's Day lunch. We ordered our drinks from the bar, which were wonderful as usual. Then we ordered the Caesar salad & White pizza lunch special along with the Ahi Tartar and cheese sticks.  Shortly after we placed our order, our server returned to tell us the White pizza had been removed from the menu :( since they recently changed it. We asked to see the menu again and decided to order the Tomato, Basil & cheese pizza with no tomatoes and add spinach to 1/2 instead of basil. In essence, the white pizza!  In the mean time, our whole order was held up while the server asked if the kitchen could add the spinach. Once she found out the kitchen would add the spinach, it was time to order our second drink & finally our lunch. Our drinks arrived quickly, then tartar & cheese sticks came out then no more than 5 minutes later...so did our salad and pizza. We put aside the pizza since it was still really hot as we finished our appetizers. The ahi was fresh & yummy. The cheese sticks were hot & melted. Then we started in on the salad. The caesar dressing was pasty white with no black pepper or Parmesan cheese. It tasted like mayo!  The lettuce was super cold & wet. Really bad!!!  We put it aside to eat the pizza. It wasn't much better. I saw there was tomato seeds on the pizza but no tomato slices. I bit into a slice and could taste the tomato juice...YUCK!  Who ever made it, forgot about the tomatoes, put them on, baked it, removed the tomatoes, added more cheese, put it back in the oven to melt then put it out to be served!  Good thing I wasn't allergic to tomatoes but I can not stand them!!  The manager came over and apologized for the error and removed it from the bill.

452,Laurice F.,"Los Angeles, CA",362,742,109.0,4.0,2012-03-23,"I go to Cheesecake Factory once in a blue moon. It's just not my style. It's a major chain that's always packed and with an absurdly large menu. With that being said, we did end up dining here last night to use up a gift card. We waited about 10mins or so before being escorted to our table. It's a huge place - my husband said it best regarding the decoration: ""It's opulent but without being classy."" So true! It's almost Vegas level, but even Vegas seems a little more unique. We were taken care of by our friendly - probably a model on the side - waitress. We started with a MARGARITA and RED SANGRIA which were both really good. The sangria was mine and I enjoyed the hint of cinnamon in each sip. We started our meal off with SWEET CORN FRITTERS. These came from the Small Plates & Snacks section and I was surprised to receive 6 decent sized fritters that came with a nice spicy aioli. Quoting my husband again (who btw has his own yelp account - hmph!): ""These fritters would make a smaller restaurant famous!"" So true again! Crispy, savory and sweet. Excuse the drool. Onto the entrees. Husband ordered the CHICKEN BELLAGIO - well-portioned and flavorful (especially the basil pasta). I had the GRILLED SHRIMP & BACON CLUB - along with shredded lettuce and a cream sauce, the grilled shrimp and bacon were great, though I was intimidated by the size of this sandwich since they stick another slice of toast in between the 2 proteins! It was a bit much, but still good. We were stuffed but decided to take home a couple of cheesecake slices - I got CLASSIC KEY LIME and he got the HERSHEY'S CHOCOLATE BAR (0.25cents is donated to Feeding America). My key lime was yummy, but a little on the too-tart side. The Hershey's was just pure decadence. Both were impossible to eat in one sitting. So though we wouldn't usually frequent a place like CF, we didn't have a bad time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=660,3.96,3.59,3.59,3.2800000000000002,3.738

I don't have any bad words for them as we had a big-ish party and they were very accommodating. Still I had a so-so meal. Yes, I know, it's a big chain restaurant. A common place where regular folk can say, ""ah yes Cheesecake Factory... [enter opinion]"". Well it was my first time at one of their fine establishments and I had no idea what they served aside the obvious. Trying to find something to eat from their extensive menu is like trying to find a passage in a book. I really wouldn't mind the amount of food they had if they didn't have PAID ADVERTISEMENTS on every other page. Full page advertisements of realtors faces, back pain drawings and a bunch of other random things. You would think they charged enough for the food to offset the cost of menus. (I'm being picky.) So I tried to ask around the table for suggestions but nobody could hear me. The whole restaurant echos sounds so I had to yell across the table to be heard. That would be fine with a table full of hawks but I was hanging with certified Seniors. I guess nobody had been there before either so i was on my own. I ended up going for the ""Factory Combination"" of Shrimp Scampi and Herb Crusted Salmon. Well the Shrimp would have been really good but I only got three measily prawns. I guess I should have gone for the full order to get 6 since 3 more shrimps would have been better than that super bland Salmon.  Yet everyone else at the table seemed happy with their food so I tasted some of their chewy steak Diane and a bit of the frozen fries and yeaaaaaahh maybe it's me. If I ever get dragged there for another birthday I think I'll just get a burger. Oh and if you're expecting a bit of free cheesecake for a birthday there you'll be disappointed.

Every time I try to dine here, the food is either flavored wrong, has too much flavoring, or just flat out tastes nasty. The only two things I'll order at this restaurant are the Fried Macaroni Balls and the Renee's Special. I went to this location with my boyfriend for lunch today and of course, I ordered the Fried Mac, the Renee's Special, and my boyfriend ordered the Bacon and Shrimp something Sandwich. We asked the waitress if she's ever had it and she said no. She also told us that a lot of people order it, so we automatically thought it would be good. She ALSO told us it's a pretty big sandwich, so I cancelled my Renee's Special so we could just half the bacon and shrimp thing. HORRIBILE IDEA! Let's review this disgusting sandwich real quick: 1. It's about 3 stories high ... it goes from toast, lettuce, tomato, bacon, toast, more lettuce, then 4-5 small pieces of overcooked, disgusting, ""grilled"" shrimp, in some nasty sauce that should be in a nasty coleslaw.  2. I gave that ugly thing a chance... I ate it. wanted to puke each time.  3. That thing was $13-$14 bucks with BURNT bacon ... and smart&final shrimp... WTF  4. The best thing about that sandwich was the buttery toast, and the tomatoes.  Service was alright. She didn't ask if our meal was ok. The passion iced tea we had tasted like nasty lipstick...and the Manager walked by, mumbled something to us, and before we got the chance to answer, he walked away... Whatevs....Cheesecake Factory will, and always suck.  P.S. why in the world are there a million advertisements in their menus? As if they don't have enough money?  I'd rather spend my money at a taco truck...That sandwich could have bought me a carne asada burrito, 4 tacos, and a quesadilla....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=900,3.84,3.68,3.432,2.8880000000000003,3.744

It had no taste what so ever, so we were dipping the chips into the soup to get some flavor"" Nice waiter apologized and came back saying the chef said he would be happy to make another one, we said it was ok and we just wanted to mention it.

They are definitely NOT shy of pouring a strong drink at this location!! The best place to sit is in the bar so you can watch the water show outside the windows behind the bar. Bar area is large and comfortable as well.  Service at the bar and by the wait staff is very good. I don't feel like they pressure people to order lots of extras like most chain restaurants do... The food itself is a 3. It always looks well presented, but we all know this isn't the highest quality stuff. It's just big hunks and piles of food. I have to say, the spinach and artichoke dip is pretty decent, though. The rest of the food was fine but nothing specially. It looks more like a decoration than something to eat.  One friend had some kind of ""Asian"" salad (I'm betting they don't have a salad this large or with this concoction of items anywhere in Asia) and it had a ridiculous amount of these noodles that were really cool looking- white, long twisty/wispy noodles. They have a simple almost non-descript flavor and it must make up 30% of this salad.  You get some bites from the salad that contain only this strange textured noodle. It's just too overwhelming. While it's a cool decoration item, it isn't good as the main part of the salad. I guess we all know that CF is more about the pomp and circumstance and less about high quality food. Chicken tenders were pretty good (but let's be real- they're chicken tenders). The mashed potatoes served with them was an enormous pile of flavorless blah. Maybe they're boxed potatoes (I'm assuming most of their food comes in frozen like Olive Garden, but maybe not?), but they could still flavor them. The corn succotash tasted like the corn had been frozen and unfrozen 6 times. It had literally 0 flavor. It was bad.

Went here with my bff, bff's brother and his girlfriend for dinner. Normally this place is ok to eat out sometimes if I want to get some cheesecake or eat their bread. This location is kind of bad because well it gets extremely crowded on weekends except for when we came. I expected at least 10-20min wait but I was wrong it was more like a 5min wait.  Our waiter I think his name is Brandon/Brendon or something like that. He was nice and very patient with us when we were waiting for my bff's brother. He also had a very energetic feel (I like). Although it felt like we were a bit ignored when we wanted more bread or wanted to order some cheesecakes.  So I love love love their bread so fresh and so good lol. For starters the bff wanted some wontons, so she got 'Chicken Wontons'. it was good but it was also way to salty. High in sodium anyone? So here were our entrees  Mine-  The Stuffed Chicken Tortilla no cilantro smothered with cheese on top and tomatoes with black beans and a corn bread topped with sour cream. This meal was GREAT! Normally when I come here I get something fried or pasta good thing I did not make that move. I would gladly recommend this dish and would get it again when I come back. BFF - Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp, she seemed to enjoy it a little except for the toasted coconut flakes on top. Although she kept staring at every ones food. It displayed with a massive amount of rice (brown) in the center than surrounded with fried chicken and like 5pcs of shrimp topped with toasted coconut flakes. In my opinion it looked good but I did not try.  BFF's bro gf - Grande Burrito Factory - this thing is HUGE, (I know because the bf got this before). So she seemed to enjoy it a little too. She complained that it had way too much rice in it which I kind of agreed. She gave my bff one end of the burrito and it contained mostly rice than anything else.  BFF's bro - the most expensive meal out all of us. Herb Crusted Salmon & Shrimp, for a $20 meal I would find this as a disappointment. For that price you can get more for your buck elsewhere even with those options. Salmon was like 3 little pieces and well this wasn't your average size shrimp they normally serve - more like a little bigger and only got 4pcs. Mashed potatoes right on the center and asparagus on the side. I wish I could've took a picture of this food.  After getting our grub on, we waited for quite some time for me get a to go box and for our waiter to let us order some cheesecakes. Was also another wait to get our check. It was busy but it was not extremely busy.  Overall our waiter was very helpful and happy to be there even though we got a little ignored. Pointers when he noticed our drinks and gave us new glasses.

The location was wonderful!!  We sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful evening.  There are heat lamps that kept the temperature perfect, and the view of the fountain was exactly what we wanted on a bustling Friday night.  The service was very nice!  Very friendly.  She was a little busy and we were a tad neglected, but it was fine.  I asked if they had gluten free options and they said they didn't.  The server tried to help weed through the HUGE menu.  I wasn't confident the server REALLY knew what was gluten free, so I stuck with a safe Vegetable Salad.  The salad came out completely dry.  A bowl full of mostly lettuce and some cut veggies.  I ate a few bites and finally asked if there was a gluten free dressing.  The guy I asked didn't seem to know what I was talking about so just I asked for oil and vinegar.  I am not a picky eater so I did eat it, but I could have made a tastier salad myself for a lot less.   My friend had a chicken dish (non-gluten free) and was very happy with the food.  FYI, there are no gluten free dessert options at all, not even a bowl of fruit. It was a fun night because of the atmosphere and the company, but all in all I was disappointed with the food.  I would think a large chain like Cheesecake Factory should have at least a couple of yummy options for gluten free meals.  Just a suggestion.  For now I will stick with Yardhouse, or PF Chang's if I desire chain restaurant food.... they love us gluten free folks and treat us very well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=1120,3.32,3.64,3.464,3.1760000000000006,3.5120000000000005

First off, this place is a zoo. It is not organized, people here are rude too. Luckily our wait was not too long and the table accommodated my daughter and her stroller. We were seated outside and it was a nice, warm night. No complaints until we met our waiter. This guy didn't seem to know anything and had zero personality. Granted, he could have been new, but really, he didn't know ANYTHING.  I asked if they validated, he said he didn't know. I ordered a to go meal for my husband and wanted to order a small cheesecake to take home, not a slice, and he told me that the small cheesecakes were $30 to $40. I really should have checked online (why the hell don't they list dessert prices on the damn menu?) because they really were $23. I wasn't going to spend the price that he stated on that cheesecake so I passed. But I have to ask, what kind of a waiter doesn't know what a small cheesecake is? Before our price conversation happened he actually came out with just a slice of cheesecake to go. That was NOT what I asked for. So much for listening skills. He also had major attitude when he was asked if we could have a side of lemon wedges for our iced tea, as he served us all iced tea without any lemons at all. I ask again, who does that? We were each given a side of lemon wedges on a cocktail napkin and not in a small dish or bowl. Service was turtle slow, it took him a half hour to bring us our checks. When he was asked to put my to go order on a separate check, he got confused and put it all on the same check and asked us to put numbers by what was on each check. Really now.

1227,Adam T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,35,,5.0,2012-09-15,The Cheesecake Factory would have to be one of the best restaurants in Glendale. Once you walk in you can tell that it is a very great place. Once you come to the desk they give you a beeper that alerts you when a table is available. Once you get to your table a waitress or waiter takes your order. Your order usually come within 20 minutes. The food there is some of the best that i've ever had. If you eat with a few other people the bill usually comes out to between $60 and $100.

1063,Jen K.,"Los Angeles, CA",276,161,35.0,2.0,2012-12-09,"So I'm not really going to comment on the food here, since it's a chain and the food is pretty good, across all their locations.  Sure their menu is way too big for its own good, but at least you know that there will be something for everyone you're eating with.  The bread is always nicely warm and the cheesecakes decadent albeit many cloyingly sweet - the best ones that I've had that aren't as sweet are the Vanilla Bean and the Tuxedo. The main issue of this review isn't even the food service, because that was just fine as well... the stinker was the management/logistics.  We came here with a party of 9 for a staff holiday lunch.  The problem: they don't take reservations!  I understand that they don't take reservations for smaller parties since they have many smaller tables and booths, but they really need to reconsider their reservation policy for larger groups... especially during the holiday season where many offices are doing their staff holiday appreciation meals. Apparently, they only have a few tables that can be assembled/used for large lunches and since other groups had beaten us to the punch, we were told that it would take about 45 minutes for us to be seated.  As we debated waiting, we stood around for 5-10 minutes when a manager came over and informed us that we could split our group into to smaller booths, which he said were next to each other.  He took us to look at the booths and yes, they were next to each other, but they were back to back, so we decided that if anything, we would rather wait for one of the group tables to open up (they ""had just gotten their entrees"" and ""would probably be done soon"" - HA, right.. because eating expeditiously is so typical of holiday lunches).  After another several minutes (and my attempts to really make things work), I asked about the patio that we saw other people sitting on, and they said that we couldn't sit there because the patio was too small and large groups are considered a fire hazard.  I figured this went for their second patio as well, so I didn't bother to ask.  As we stood outside for another 10 minutes trying to decide what we wanted to do, what our other options in the area were, the manager came over and offered to set up a table on the second patio which was significantly larger, where we ended up having our meal. While it was nice and we had a great lunch, I just don't understand why it took them so long to (point blank) get their sh!t together.  You would think that their managers would be prepped on what to do in these situations, but they obviously aren't.  I remember when I worked at another similar chain restaurant, the managers there would bust their a$$es and bend over backwards to accommodate large groups because they knew that customers = money and more customers out the door meant more money out the door (what a novel concept!!).  I hope this place pulls it together because while I'll probably go back to Cheesecake at some point in my life, I'm pretty sure it's not going to be this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=1060,3.84,3.75,3.568,2.9520000000000004,3.786

With prior notice from the hostess that our dog needed to be leashed OUTSIDE the fenced area, which we completely agreed to, we were seated out in the patio. Everything was fine; my dog was behaving fine (with the leash tied to the black fence outside), my mom and I were served our waters & bread, and we were waiting for our server to show up. Then comes a 'manager' that tells us they couldn't serve us because we had our dogs with us and other diners had an issue with this. We were asked to leave the restaurant. SERIOUSLY? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Your 'competent' hostess already knew we had our dog with us, and he was (as indicated), OUTSIDE the dining area. We only noticed two occupied tables that were far away from our table, so where did you get this ""complaint"" from? They didn't even notice our dog because my mom leashed him prior to coming in through the side door. I wouldn't have an issue with this, and I've seen diners at this particular branch at the Americana with dogs in the past. But there are so many things wrong with this picture. You could have refused to serve us FROM THE GET GO because we had our dog - when I walked in the restaurant to ask, my mom was waiting OUTSIDE by the side door so we wouldn't disturb diners. You also didn't have to disrespect us by wasting our time getting seated only to be kicked out minutes later. I still have yet to receive a reply from you even after writing an email to explain the situation in a detailed manner.

I don't care how busy you are, once you sit me down, please remember that I am sitting there. This location was probably the busiest Cheesecake Factory I've been to, and considering how busy all the Cheesecake Factories I've been to are like, that is saying a lot. The line to put in your name goes out the door. Waiting time to sitting down is about 45 minutes. Once my friend and I were brought to our table, we sat there for possibly another ten minutes, fifteen minutes before someone came to ask us for our order for our drinks. In fact, other bigger parties were sat down and ordered before we were asked to. I'm not usually an impatient person, but seeing others order before us despite being sat down a long time before they were does not make me very happy. They did not automatically bring us bread either - we had to ask for it. The waitress, though very friendly, seemed to forget about us a couple of times, and then, when we decided to pack up our food and take it home since it was getting too cold out side to eat comfortably, they brought us boxes, but asked us to pack up our food ourselves. Normally, this would be fine, but seeing as every other Cheesecake Factory I've been to packs up your food for you, this was irritating as it was easy to create a mess trying to pack fairly full meals into these tiny boxes.  The two stars are for the food. The minus three stars is for the lack of service. Since it's not my normal destination for Cheesecake Factory, it's safe to say I won't be going out of my way to go here.

It's a slightly breaded thin breast of chicken with a little cheese to its crust. The pasta is in a standard tomato sauce. It's my go to dish here. I also like the road side sliders. Perfect little burgers of ground beef & onions served on dinner rolls. Already comes with ketchup. Genius! Hold the pickles, yo! The pizzas are good, the salads are monsters.... The most popular dishes are probably the jambalaya and chicken madeira. The bread is good, the butter is delish... The pulled pork sammich... was surprisingly disappointing. The chunks were too big. Couldn't eat it in that sandwich. It needed to be shredded or actually pulled apart more.  I had the fish & chips before and I really liked it. I found myself craving it last Friday night. And being Lent, it was perfect for a take home dinner. Called it in, avoided the madness that is the Cheesecake Factory waiting area and took it home. It was crispy, delicious, the batter was perfect. It comes with coleslaw, tartar sauce for dipping & french fries. A good serving of coleslaw, I might add.

I left work early to take my daughter to a fun lunch at the Americana, and opted to go to the cheesecake factory.  My daughter ordered a burger, and I ordered a salad, simple enough.  Well, we got the appetizer fairly quickly; however, after the appetizer came we waited another 40 minutes and the food never came AND our waitress disappeared.  I flagged down a different waitress who then checked on our order, and a few minutes later showed up with the burger which had obviously been sitting under the heat lamps for a while since the cheese was all cold and puckered looking, and the beef was rubbery, um if I'm paying $13.00 for a burger it better be hot and cooked correctly.   After a few more minutes the manager shows up, and tried to make us happy, but by that point my daughter was crying because she was so angry, and she just wanted to leave.  I explained to the manager that I don't have issue waiting for food, but they should have at least checked in with us and let us know that our order was delayed.  A waitress shouldn't just leave the patron waiting...we were there so long someone even came by and packed up our appetizer before the food even came, that alone speaks volumes.

For my meal I ordered the Thai Lettuce Wrap with no chicken/portabello mushrooms instead. When I said ""no chicken"" to my waiter, his eyes nearly popped out of his head and he was in such a state of disbelief that a person could not want chicken in their meal that he had to ask me again, ""so, that's no chicken?"".  None-the-less, it was surprisingly very, very tasty.

826,Keely G.,"Los Angeles, CA",797,262,55.0,1.0,2013-05-18,"TSK, TSK Cheesecake Factory!  Before I commence with my scathing review about our lunch yesterday, let me state that I eat here all the time and normally I receive the type of service I've come to expect at a CF: excellent. That being said, yesterday's experience from top to bottom sucked. Big time.  The only positive was being warmly greeted by the hostess Maddy.  As a huge Laker fan, I recognized her right away as one of the Laker Girls. : ) Being that it was a gorgeous day, we asked for a table outside on the patio. Wish granted.  However, the girl who took the four of us to our table, brought us to a party of 10 people and started to put our menus down, which created an awkward moment where we were wondering ""who are these people and why do we have to sit with them?"" while said people were looking at us thinking, ""who are these girls crashing our party?"" So I told the girl, ""Hold on, you know we're not with those people right?"" Clearly flustered, she just sat us at the closest table, dropped the menus and bolted. Well, the table was as close as any table could possibly be to the huge party, & we just wanted a nice, quiet lunch away from parties & kids, so we asked to be moved. Little did we know, we were moving to a new area that would bring us to the worst service imaginable.  1.) Drinks came & I had some foreign object floating in my iced tea. No harm, no foul as it was replaced. 2.) My friend decided she wanted a lemonade, so she ordered one at the time our initial drinks were being delivered (more on that later). 3.) Normally, we request a basket of that delicious honey wheat bread (no white bread) but a mixed basket was plunked down before we had a chance to ask. No worries, less carbs is probably a good thing. 4.) We order two Skinnyliscious Factory Salads, a Skinnyliscious Chicken Salad sandwich and a Grilled Chicken Sandwich.  After what seemed like an eternity, our food shows up. But, not all the food, only the TWO salads. One of the salads had a hair in it, but my friend wasn't sure if it was hers (her hair was in a ponytail) or not. She convinced herself it was hers (EEK). Surely, the other two dishes are right behind it, right?  Wrong.  It was about 10-15 minutes before the Grilled Chicken sandwich showed up, leaving one person at our table with no food. And not wanting to be rude, we all just sat there & waited & waited & waited for the Chicken Salad sandwich to show up.  It was around this time, that my friend's lemonade showed up (30 minutes later!)  Our waitress never came by during this entire debacle until my laser beam glare caught her from across the patio and I motioned her over.  When informed that we were missing a dish & that we had been waiting a really long time for it, she went to check it out & came back with just the side salad in a small bowl and plunked it down. Honestly, it looked like mixed greens and dressing that would have taken 15 seconds to make. Well, finally, we can all get started eating... but by that time we were pretty much fed up.  We flagged down some random girl & asked for the manager. Clearly, she goes and tells our server of our request for a manager instead of sending him directly over because after 10-15 more minutes the joke of a sandwich shows up, delivered by our waitress. Huge white plate, with a mid-sized sandwich sitting in the middle--not even a garnish. No joke, it was two slices of toasted white bread with premade chicken salad, lettuce and a tomato. THAT IS WHAT WE WAITED 40+ MINUTES FOR??!!!  I've made sandwiches at home that looked better than that!  And mind you, it wasn't even crowded in the restaurant. Instead of apologizing, she asks ""Do you still want to speak to the manager?""  Are you crazy lady? Of course we do! Even more so now. 5.) The ""Manager"" - Oh boy. I think his name was Julian or Justin and I'm still not convinced that he was even a manager given his demeanor dealing with us. It was evident that our waitress had given him her (very skewed) version of events prior to his arrival because he comes over and very nonchalantly says, ""So, I hear there was a dish that took a little longer to arrive.""  Really, dude?  Honestly, I think he apologized but I'm not entirely sure as he spoke very fast and mumbly, which came off as totally insincere. He offered to give us a complimentary dessert, which we declined being that 3 of the 4 of us ordered from the SKINNYliscious menu (Hellooo, summer is upon us!).  I think that threw him for a loop and he looked unsure what to do at that point. Finally, he offered to comp the meal that took ages to arrive and he left. In summary, a nice quick bite to eat for lunch turned into an irritating, unsatisfying nearly 2 hour experience. Shame on you Cheesecake Factory, I really expect so much more from you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=740,3.08,3.5,3.536,2.8200000000000003,3.3320000000000007

Some I wasn't a fan of, most are okay, few are great. My absolute favvvvvv is the Louisiana chicken pasta, it's a little on the spicy side and I like how the chicken is breaded. The avocado egg rolls are the best from anywhere else I have tried. I was not a fan of the orange chicken. Oh and the drinks :) yummmm!

Seating, I usually pick indoor, or first-available if I'm hungry and desperate.  After eating there a few times, I realize I don't like dining outdoors.  The buildings surrounding the Americana can kind of make a mini wind tunnel.  It can get a bit cold during the fall-winter-spring months.  You might also experience napkins flying off your table.  Secondly, there's a lot of people walking around and if dining privacy/intimacy is something you might be looking for, then I'd recommend indoor seating instead.  If you don't want to wait, you could always try the bar area and find the first available seat. Service, I haven't really had any issues with the service of the several times I've been here.  I think I can only recall 1 instance in which we felt neglected... that was when we were dining outside and there was a big planter that blocked our visibility of the staff and vice-versa.  It is either we were just fortunate to have received good service, or we're just easy going dinner patrons, but I haven't experienced terrible service as I've seen in the other reviews.

It's the Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake, it was SO good, but not as good as the Costco one.  It was definitely good enough taste wise for the wedding but the way it looked whole didn't have a wedding cake look, so we went to the second runner up, the Red Velvet Cheesecake, which easily doubled as a casual wedding cake.  It was about $50 and we picked it up the day of the wedding. As far as food, I ordered the same thing I used to get when I was a kid, the Louisiana Chicken pasta, it never disappoints, but after about 5 pieces of bread, I can never finish even half of the portion, but it makes for a great doggie bag. The nice part about this location, which we like to refer to as the 'knock off Grove' since it's so very similar, but not quite, the Grove in West Hollywood by our house.  The one thing I did like better about this one was that while you sit outside at the Cheesecake Factory, you can get a great view of the fountain and watch the fountain dance along to the music and rainbows.  It's quite magical if you can forget about the mega mall type shops you're surrounded by in retail hell.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=400,3.76,3.58,3.44,3.216,3.652

But this time we were shopping at the Americana and my bf was hungry so we just decided to eat there. I gave 1 star for the wait time, which was only 2 minutes, which was great and 1 star for our waiter, read and find out why. I was not too hungry so we ordered a shrimp Alfredo to share, and while waiting I realized that my small round plate was dirty. I didn't make a big deal about it, I just didn't use it. Then we noticed our forks were dirty, so my bf asks for another set. He brings 3 forks, and I'm assuming he didn't even take the time to check to see if they were dirty or not, because they were DISGUSTING. This all happened within the first 5 to 10 mins we were seated and that's how long it took for them to bring our food, which made me suspicious, is it fresh? Or not?  Usually the presentation of the food is nice but no not this time, because it seemed liked they didn't care that the sauce was all over the plate. Anyways, my bf asks for plastic utensils and our waiter forgets about that but he did bring 2 plates so we can share, and of course those were dirty as well. So our food is getting cold and my bf decides to go to the front and get the utensils. When we finally started eating,  the Alfredo sauce was very sweet and did not taste the same. I literally had 3 bites of it and I just couldn't force myself to eat more. This is why I probably will not return to this location, unless I'm with a group and I just sit and don't order anything.

First of all, their menu is just about enormous as their restaurant. The list of dishes is RIDICULOUS. Although, too many options can lead to indecisiveness and maybe even frustration.. But whatever, they all end up tasting great anyway. ONE DOWNFALL: They don't take reservations via phone. Walk-up only. This goes for The Grove location too. And the longest I ever had to wait was 45 minutes and the only reason I agreed to the wait was because there was a Sugarfina location at the corner I wanted to check out (which, by the way was no good) What I got/tried in the past: Da Vinci pasta. Tasted great. The sauce was reminiscent to stroganoff, except slighty sweeter. It's good! The noodles were of penne. Portion is huge, ofcourse. Club Sandwich with fries & ranch dressing. The best part of this meal? THEIR RANCH DRESSING. It's thick and the flavor just explodes in your mouth. The sandwich was good. The ingredients were fresh and tasty. Fries were amazing :) They have one of the best restaurant style fries~!! The Firecracker Salmon appetizer. It tasted great. They're like egg rolls stuffed with salmon. Comes with shredded red cabbage and asian dressing that was yum! It was sweet, garlicy, gingery and sesame-y lol. And I honestly don't remember what else I've tried in the past, but I know I enjoyed my meals every time. So.. unless their lacking in the sanitary department, there really isn't much to complain about.  OH ALSO HOW COULD I FORGET. Their cheesecakes!

If seated outside you have a full view of the large fountain which is always running, and the opportunity to ""people watch.""  However today we choose to be seated inside (actually we told the host which ever seats were available first). I think being seated inside today was a great choice due to the heat. We came around lunch time on a Saturday, and although it was crowded we only waited 10-15mins.  I was delighted to discover their ""skinnylicious"" menu. They have organized the menu into four or five different sections based on calories in each of the following dishes. Ordering from this menu allows you to enjoy your meal guilt free. This was my first time ordering off this menu, I am not sure if it is a new addition for them, but I was left completely satisfied.  The best way to order, at any restaurant, is to order two plates to share. By doing so you have the opportunity to expand your culinary palate. We ordered the grilled salmon with vegetables and it was delicious. The carrots, offered on my plate, where huge and cooked to perfection; so moist and soft. The asparagus was also cooked perfectly and my favorite part was the absence of fatty oil.  We also ordered steak medallions (also on the skinny menu) and substituted the mash potatoes for more veggies. Delicious. Another friend ordered a salad from the same menu, it was huge! She could not finish it all... it looked very fresh and she said it was good.

262,Richard K.,"East Bay, CA",465,404,3716.0,1.0,2014-10-18,"God I hate this place. The only reason I go to this ridiculously unhealthy corporate restaurant that is worse than McDonald's in terms of being bad for you is because my silly parents like this place. Then again, they used to think Sizzler was the bomb and they still eat steak well done... SMH.... Look, I just don't get why this place is so popular. Service is always shitty and wait times are almost always an hour or more for food that tastes no better than Stouffer's frozen food. And honestly, I have no idea why they bother with Asian food that tastes worse than Panda Express. Trust me when I say the Teriyaki Chicken with Rice is just deplorable - I mean, it makes Mr. Yoshida's sauce seem heavenly. My silly parents ordered this... uggh... And their shitty pizzas taste pre-packaged since they probably are shipped to the Cheesecake Factory from a Sysco-owned distribution warehouse. And speaking of pre-packaged, you should know that despite its name, none of the Cheesecake Factory restaurants actually make any cheesecakes in-house. All that is done in a ""cheesecake factory"" over in Calabasas. So if you really go to this restaurant for the cheesecake, just stop by the frozen section at your local Ralph's because it's the same shit albeit a whole lot cheaper.  And, as if to make your experience even more ""cheesy"" (pun intended), their menus are as thick as college readers. That is because not only does the Cheesecake Factory have over 200 items to choose from, their menus are filled with more freaking advertisements than the ""free version"" of Angry Birds, YouTube, and the Sunday newspaper combined. I mean, sorry Artin, I really am not  ""thinking of buying or selling"" a home when I look at a menu. Go spend your advertisement money on a bus bench ""bro"".  But the main reason I hate this place is because eating here is unhealthy and will take you one step closer to a heart attack since nearly every entrée here is served with exorbitant amounts of sodium and fat. Take for instance the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic pasta dish consisting of bow-tie pasta, chicken, mushrooms, tomato, pancetta, peas and caramelized onions in a roasted garlic-parmesan cream sauce. This deceptively healthy sounding dish comes out to 2,190 calories, 58 grams of saturated fat (three day's worth) and 1,830 milligrams (mg) of sodium.  That is more than a Big Mac combo with a large Coke (1,580 calories) and two extra cheeseburgers (300 calories each). Moreover, the current dietary guidelines for Americans recommends that adults in general should consume no more than 2,300 mg of sodium per day. And you know those ""famous"" Avocado Eggroll appetizers? One serving is 960 calories and contains 1,130 mg of sodium. And their ""healthy"" salads are filled with exorbitant amounts of sodium that make Maruchan Instant Ramen Noodles seem healthy. Take a look at the Asian Chicken Salad, which the Cheesecake Factory lists under their ""weight management"" section of their menu. While the salad has only 570 calories, it has 2,600 mg of sodium... sneaky, deceptive, shameless. While I apologize for going off-tangent and turning into a health nut there (I just got a blood test and my LDL cholesterol came out high), unless you want the Fattycake Fattery to kill you, you really shouldn't eat here. But don't take my word for it.  * It's funny how they have a ""Skinnylicious"" section of the menu. That means, the rest of it is Fatty-ridiculous...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=260,3.28,3.37,3.36,2.404,3.334

We started at the bar area while we we're waiting for our food and the waiter that was helping us was rude when he found out we we're waiting for a table. It's understandable that whatever we order there that we would need to close out the check first before moving to the main dining. But to make me wait almost 10 mins to get my check since he hopped from one table to another was unacceptable.  So then we moved to the main dining and it seems even our new waiter has some attitude and seemed snobby/irritated. But he was attentive and refilled drinks. Maybe he was just having an off day. Here's my feedback on the food: calamari - even though it was cooked right. way too much breading and too salty. corn tortilla soup - was amazing pepperoni pizza - crust was great but it was too salty chicken alfredo - pasta was al dente and it tasted great.

I felt like I was on a research paper assignment while deciding what to eat. This menu is enough for 15 standalone restaurants. I couldn't imagine being a line cook here. I ordered the Stuffed Mushrooms for an appetizer and the Shrimp Bistro Pasta, she got the Chicken Piccata.  We waited over 30 minutes for the food to arrive and then noticed that the Stuffed mushrooms never made it to the table.  I could've grown my own mushrooms in that time. The waitress apparently forgot to put it in the system and then blamed it on the kitchen. Now that's some high-class service. But I get it, I blame my farts on the dog whenever it slides by someones nose.  Aside from that, the food was okay. The Shrimp Bistro had good flavor but the texture could've been a bit crispier. I took a bite of the Chicken Piccata and enjoyed the citrus component of the dish. If it wasn't for the company, I'd give it 2 stars but we had some good laughs about it.

I guess I'm weird in that I feel hot food should be served hot but apparently the servers at Cheesecake feel your dish should sit on the service counter for a good 10 minutes before they bring it to your table, how is it that the servers at Apple bee's manage to bring your food while it still sizzling but they can't master this craft at Cheesecake factory. You might think I expect too much but the burger cost 13 dollars so maybe yeah I should expect a certain level of performance from the service crew but at this point I've written so many bad reviews for Cheesecake in Glendale that if no one has taken notice then it really isn't effective to continue; five star restaurant this is not.. or four star or even 3.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=960,2.96,3.27,3.312,2.6640000000000006,3.146

At this CF they take your phone number and send you a text when your table is ready which is nice.  This way you can roam around the Americana shopping area. Usually you are given a flashing pager and you can't leave the front lobby area so they texting method is nice. We went to Barnes and Noble for a bit and before you know it our table was ready.  Again the food here is great, come hungry because the portions are large. The menu usually has something for everyone in your group including kids. I had the fish and chips for the first time there and wasn't disappointed.  5 big pieces and lots of fries. The slaw was tasty too.  Service was great, our waiter kept out glasses full and checked in often even with the full restaurant.  Had to take some of our plates home but that's ok - lunch leftovers the next day. So much food no room for cheesecake.  Although when I do get cheesecake it's awesome.

There was an hour and a half wait for our group...the good news is this place is located in the Americana in Glendale so there's plenty of things to do/see while you wait for your table. You can go on ahead and get a drink from the bar or take pictures in front of the fountain or roam around the three-story Barnes. Cheesecake Factory actually takes your phone number and TEXTS you when your table is ready so that's really convenient!  It's really dim inside so it was kind of hard to read the tiny print on the menu or take any good pictures without flash. Well our group of 11 ordered an array of dishes...here's what we got: - Avocado Egg Rolls (Appetizer: Avocado, tomato, and cilantro wrapped in a crispy wonton wrapper) - Tex Mex Egg Rolls (Appetizer: Chicken, corn, peppers, black beans, onions, and cheese wrapped in crispy wonton wrapper) - Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta (Chicken, asparagus, peas, peppers, garlice and onion with penne pasta tossed in Chipotle cream sauce topped with tortilla crisps) - Hibachi Steak (Angus hanger steak with mushrooms and onions and bean sprouts served with mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus) - Chicken Bellagio (Crispy chicken on basil pasta and topped with prosciutto and arugula)  - Spicy Cashew Chicken (Mandarin-style chicken served with cashews over white rice) The egg rolls were superb! The outer skin was flaky and crispy and delicious while the inside was HOT and creamy and so full of flavor. They are both served with dipping sauces which complement the egg rolls very well. All the entrees, however, were disappointing. Everything was too salty! The cashew chicken and hibachi steak, especially.  My favorite item was the spicy chicken chipotle pasta!  Most items here range in price from $12.95 to $18.95. MOST items. I really liked that they had a ""Skinnylicious"" menu as well for those watching their caloric intake!  Service here was great! Super packed but we felt taken care of and attended to!

The date of the event, on 12/18/14, I receive a call from a staff member/management stating that my reservations will not be honored as I requested because the staff member who took my reservation was ""not authorized"" to do so. (??? How was I suppose to know that and why should their problem become mine?) Instead she insisted that all 20 of us show up by 3:30 or the tables will be given away. This was unreasonable because as teachers having to work with parents and preparing lessons, it is VERY difficult to decide last minute to leave work early, not to mention the obvious: the difficulty of getting 20 teachers to leave early the DAY OF -as this call was made to me 4 hours prior to the event time.... At this point, it was necessary for me to asked to speak to the manager above, on site. Needless to say, I was feeling panicky and thinking, ""I can't believe this happening! CHEESECAKE would do it??! What they are doing is wrong AND will all 20 of my coworkers have a seat?"" So I basically begged the manager to honor the reservation that was taken two weeks prior, FOR 4:00, and that 20 PEOPLE SIGNED UP to attend and are counting on the reservations. I was stern but remained respectful. He was not empathic. I told him I was very disappointed and yet he didn't seem to care. He would not honor the original 4:00 reservation. W-O-W. I will NEVER make reservations again at CHEESECAKE FACTORY.  OUTCOME of the event: After being stress out and scrambling with my committee members, we spread the word to our coworkers and told them the situation and asked them to please arrive at 3:30, if possible.... Fast forward to 3:30: our tables were occupied and were NOT available for us UNTIL 4. (Interesting, I was threatened that we would lose our tables if we were not present by 3:30.) the good news is, we all got chairs so I was relieved at that point and decided for the evening I will enjoy and forget management and deal with the upset later. At the time it was easy to be happy because I had good company, the holidays were approaching and the servers were friendly and prompt.

I call it, ""OMG YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL I WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND BECAUSE OF HOW NICE YOU ARE."" Water cups were filled and refilled again. I ordered a Midori Sour, which was made very alcoholicky (as alcoholic as Midori Sours come, anyway...) They took really good care of my seafood allergy and made sure not to cross-contaminate anything. Fried macaroni cheese balls are a MUST at this Cheesecake Factory--they really, really know how to do them (better than the other Cheesecake Factories, except for maybe The Grove.) I got the Chicken Fettucini with the sun dried tomatoes and pink sauce--pink sauce was perfect, Fettucini was perfect and piping hot, and there was a generous amount of chicken. My friend (who insisted on taking me here for my birthday because she had never had Cheesecake Factory--it's okay, I gasped too--) had a roasted chicken thingy with mashed potatoes and carrots (which she bit into, and proceeded to sigh in contentment.) We had to order the Original Cheesecake (since it was my birthday.) I got a very out-of-tune chorus from the staff and the nice table sitting next to us. Basically, I felt super uber happy.

Next up we the Imperial Chicken and Shrimp dish.  This is very similar to their version of Orange Chicken and Shrimp.  Big generous pieces of both and the rice was very flavorful .  This was yet another winner and was completely devoured!! Finally we had the Herb Crusted Chicken Filets with a side of mashed potatoes.  Made to perfection!!  You could cut the chicken with your fork and the lightly crusted herb topping was perfect!!  The mashed potatoes were home style and chunky!!

It was jam packed on the rainy Saturday night, we had to settle with the bar area since we were starving and don't want to wait 45 minutes. The servers were tentative, and made some great suggestions on what to order. I had the skinnylicious angle hair with shrimp, my friends ordered the meat ball lasagna with prosciutto, and pamersan chic hen pasta.  The portion of the food from the regular menu is huge, I would call it family sized. The skinny menu is perfectly portioned for one, and they do use a yogurt instead of heavy cream for the white sauce. That compromised the flavor quite a bit, so I was not super happy with the taste, but it only has 500 calories. In comparison, the regular menu with full on ingredients are much tastier--I could taste the generous olive oil and heavy cream and cheese topping. The flat bread with pear and blue cheese was delicious, and of course we had to end the meal with a lovely slice of white chocolate macadamia cheese cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!!!

My brother and I went during lunch on a weekday and sat down right away. We browsed through the menu for about 15 minutes before we made a decision. For those of you that are familiar with Cheesecake Factory, you know just how long it takes to pick one item, as there are 100,000,000 different dishes.  I chose the southern fried chicken sliders and my brother chose the chicken picante. My sliders was so yummy! It was the perfect lunch portion and I topped it off with a delicious strawberry lemonade. My brother was very pleased with his dish and gave it a 8 out of 10. Then the dessert menu arrived... which is always a problem, as we are always too hungry for dessert, but order it anyways. We ordered the white chocolate blondie cheesecake and raspberry cheesecake.

It's a really large space and if you come at the right moments the wait time for a table isn't longer than 10 minutes. The menu is super humongous so it's ridiculously difficult to decide what to order. I ended up ordering Pasta with Chicken and Scampi Sauce. It took a while to arrive at our table (about 30 minutes or so). The pasta and sauce were so heavy, but delicious. They went crazy with the chicken and the garnish though. There were so many pieces of chicken that I started thinking that I ordered Chicken with Pasta and Scampi sauce instead. Normally I wouldn't mind such a generous helping for the price paid, but the chicken was weird and bumpy looking on the outside (as if it still had skin on), not sure why. The herb garnish was so thick that it started to get in the way of the pasta at one point. Of course I had no room for dessert after that large plate of pasta--I couldn't even finish it!  The service here was alright. My friend and I split the bill--I paid part of it with card and she paid her portion with cash. The server made the mistake of assuming that my friend's change is his tip so he kept it and just brought back the receipt. I mean, there wasn't much change so it probably would have all been his tip, but assuming that right off the bat and keeping it is kind of annoying. He should have waited until she left the tip at the end instead.  Not a bad place for dinner once in a while, but the service and overindulgent portions of heavy food will probably keep me away from here for a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=680,3.68,3.4,3.412,3.0520000000000005,3.5120000000000005

At first my visit seemed like a normal one, I go to the Cheesecake Factory in Pasadena occasionally and enjoy it. I ordered my normal small plates, I really enjoy the small plates menu because then I can try a bunch of different things. So I ordered chicken samosas, crispy crab bites, and loaded potato bites to share with my mother. They were tasty as usual but we had small appetites so we decide to take some things home with us. We had a few crab bites left and the great majority of a LARGE plate of loaded potato bites left over. I thought ""Oh great I'll have an entire meal for later."" The server offered to take the food and wrap it up for us, I replied yes and several minutes later he arrived with our take-home container.  The next day while at home I took the container out of the refrigerator, eyes filled with glee, excited about my lovely loaded potato bites waiting for me. This is where things took a turn. When I opened the container my heart dropped and my stomach growled. There were only 4 potato bites inside the container. I HAD AN ENTIRE PLATE LEFTOVER, I had been cheated. The server had taken my food to the back and either dropped it, eaten it, or just plain threw it out. I DO NOT enjoy paying for things I will never get to eat. TOTALLY CHEATED.

Literally as we said those 4 little words, the guy we were talking to walked away to do something else and completely ignored us - even though he'd clearly seen AND heard us. Excellent start. Thought whatever and told the now only other host the same thing. This guy had serious attitude from the start. Talking down to us in a very condescending way, he mentioned it would take about 45 minutes - not great, but expected given it was a nice day at the weekend. Fine, we'll wait. How about a table outside? Maybe another 5-10 minutes. Ok - great, table outside, please. He'd already taken down a name, so we gave a cell number for them to text us when table was ready - since they'd 'run out of pagers'. As far as I knew they don't even have pagers any more... weird. We checked out things in the shops and walked around the Americana till 3:45 and decided to check when our table would be ready. Just as well we did! I went to the front of the line (as anyone does when they've already spoken with the host) to ask. The same attitude-problem guy was there and wouldn't even let me talk. ""Urgh, YOU just cut in front of all these people! You need to go the end of the line! All these people have been waiting!"" As if looking to start a mutiny among guests. Oh, HELL NO!! I found a random server working at a register by the bar and mentioned the rude host and that we just wanted to check how much longer we'd have to wait. Server managed to find the manager (yeahy) to help us. Sadly the manager couldn't find either our name or our number in the list... But in the end he just seated us anyway and did actually apologize when I mentioned how rude, arrogant and condescending the host was at both interactions.

Wife is vegetarian and likes the menu, there's plenty of choices and if they aren't slammed, they will make her order however she wants to adjust it, except for the one time mentioned in the last paragraph of this review. Only had one bad experience here. We were seated on a really slow early lunchtime and the server seemed like she may have had a bad audition that day or something. We weren't thrilled with the extra late greeting, we're easy going people, but the aloof attitude followed by no effort to get wifey a slightly altered sandwich to fit her needs, caused us to get up and walk out after taking a few sips of water.

Now when I order this dish I have discovered... thin skinny pasta and not even spicy hot. the chicken bland and just added to the sauce. when I ask it make it spicier  A. they don't B. The answer to that was let me bring you some pepper flakes, which he didn't bring.  but regardless pepper flakes is not the same hot as the cayenne pepper hot that the dish is made with and just needs more of.  so I guess you can not add to a dish that is already pre prepared  back in the day the dish was prepared together not place item on top and ad sauce. and very little sauce at . the waiter brought us more sauce from the start due to he said "" I brought you extra sauce since everybody want's more sauce""  if the demand is more sauce to each customer why are you serving dry pasta on a wet pasta dish???? my husbands dish completely different menu item the chicken tasted just like my chicken . bland . it seems like chicken is just boiled in salt water and added to any dish as needed.

539,James K.,"San Diego, CA",472,370,602.0,3.0,2015-06-06,"First time at this location, but not the first time at Cheesecake Factory.  To sum it up, great food but average service.  It was a Friday afternoon so it was pretty busy.  I asked how long the wait and they told us 15-20 minutes.  That was fine and they use your mobile number to notify you of your seat so you can go out walking around if you want.   Once we received the text, I went up to the counter and they told us to ""hold on"".  It's odd because why send me the text if you aren't ready to take us.  I realize some people may have left the restaurant but it seems most hang around so when you send the text, I would think you would be ready.  We stood by and noticed many other people and some groups coming up and getting seated.  After watching about a half dozen other people get seated, we went back up to let them know we were texted about the seat.  They looked at us a little confused and it seemed as if they had given our seat away to another couple.  However, they finally took us back to a table that hadn't been cleared.  I certainly don't mind waiting for a table to be cleared because it's only a few minutes.  But the isle is so tight, we had to stand right over someone else's table and I felt bad for those people trying to eat.   Ultimately we were seated and our server came out and took our drink orders.  When she came back with our drinks, we already knew what we wanted and placed our orders.  I had the club sandwich with a side salad.  I'm a big club sandwich lover and when they delivered it, it simply looked spectacular.  Three slices of white bread with a generous portion of fresh turkey (not processed).  Lettuce, nice full strips of bacon and tomato.  Cut into quarters as is traditional and there was a small cup of fries that came with the sandwich.  I bit into the sandwich and it was SO good!  Normally I'll eat half the club sandwich and take the rest with me but this time I ate the whole sandwich it was that good.  If I were to make a comment, it would be the tomato.  They put too much tomato and they should try buying fresh tomato's from a farmers market or something because these were not quite ripe.  I pulled off the excess tomato and it was perfect.   I had iced tea to drink and it was fresh brewed tea!  So great especially when so many other places use instant tea for their iced tea.  We decided to take some slices of the strawberry cheesecake to bring to our friends we were going to see after dining here.  Our server brought out the cheesecake slices in individual plastic containers (recyclable) with forks and napkins for each slice.  The only problem was when we finally got to where we were going, the cheesecake slices looked more like pudding!  The containers for the cheesecake slices are way too big for a single slice and they must have moved around quite a bit while driving.  The car was air conditioned so it wasn't a heat problem.  But it's shocking since the car is a luxury car and the ride was smooth.  Of course it tastes the same, but it just looked terrible when I went to give these to our friends. If you were reading closely, you might have noticed I mentioned a side salad and yet didn't talk about it at all. That's because they never brought it and I didn't realize this until long after we had left.  But of course, they did charge us for it.  I hope our server is enjoying the 20% tip we left her!!!  She did provide good service but it was reflective of our overall service at this restaurant.  Cheesecake Factory is known for being slammed all the time at every location I've ever visited so this isn't anything new for them.  But to forget about us after notifying us that our table is ready, taking us to a dirty table and our server forgetting the salad.  Very unsatisfactory.  The only reason I give the three stars and not lower was because the food was very good.  Our server was very friendly and for the most part, very attentive.  If it weren't for the missing salad, I would say she was perfect.  Frankly, I don't really mind so much except that I was charged for the salad and ended up paying for it.  If she had realized (which she should have) she could have taken it off the bill.  Last, I'm so happy they use recyclable containers for the cheesecake, but try getting a bit smaller so the slices to move around so much and end up looking pudding when you get home.   Good place to eat when you are shopping here and I would probably go back to a Cheesecake Factory just for the club sandwich.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=280,3.44,3.6,3.428,2.9240000000000004,3.5360000000000005

It took the guy 40 minutes to take our order. We were there for 1 hour and 50 minutes after eating our food fast cause it was after our curfew and there were 2 different tables that came after us and left before us. We told the guy were not giving you a tip cause your a terrible waiter and you just lost a solid $20 tip. We didn't give it cause why should a person deserve $20 for righting down something on paper and bringing drinks. He also gave us attitude when he actually did serve us. Hate Cheesecake cause of the workers having self-opinions on people because of there age and race. The foods not even that good for being that expensive.

I've also been here during happy hour. Appetizers and drinks are great during this time at an even better price.  Service is great and friendly. An enthusiastic waiter/waitress makes a real big difference.  Overall, besides the children that scream and cry out every once in awhile, and having to talk over voices since it's kinda loud in there, it has a good ambience.  People really like celebrating their birthdays here (I think it's kinda exciting).

Then my steak came and brought me the wrong starch again. I order my steak rare and it came out med/rare and dry. I was so hungry I tried to eat it but I only can  finish half the steak because it was so salty and dry. Later on manager came by ask me what my opinion is and I gave her my 2 cents. Obviously the steak and the pasta was fire at the same time. So the steak dried out under the heat lamp hence all the juice came out. That is why the steak was swimming in plate. What kill me even more after the night of horror is the manager. She came up never introduced herself and said I ate too much of the steak lol. came back with the check and said "" try to run a business here so I only charge you for the steak and wine"".

58,Paola N.,"Los Angeles, CA",824,351,1645.0,5.0,2015-07-27,"You can't go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory. THE AMBIANCE: This is my most frequented location. The restaurant is clean, spacious, and has high ceilings. I tend to sit at the bar and there is ample room to enjoy a meal. THE FOOD: The Cheesecake Factory starts you off with a complimentary basket of warm white and wheat bread. The wheat bread (brown) is to die for and I usually request that we get a basket of all wheat bread because I don't like wasting food and the white bread rarely gets eaten. That is how good the brown wheat bread is.  My favorite appetizers are the Ahi Carpaccio (Thin Slices of Raw Ahi Tuna, Wasabi Pesto, Creamy Avocado and Togarashi Aioli), and Crispy Crab Wontons (Crabmeat Blended with Cream Cheese, Green Onion, Water Chestnuts, and Sweet Chili Sauce Fried Crisp in Wonton Wrappers). The Ahi Carpaccio I can eat sometimes as my lunch entree if I am not that hungry because I always eat a lot of bread and butter at the beginning *guilty* It is soooo good. I usually ask for light wasabi pesto. The Togarashi Aoili on the side is beyond delicious. You just want to drink it. The Crispy Crab Wontons are so good and so fattening but I don't care. I would literally eat them all if someone else wasn't picking at the plate.  My favorite entrees are: Chicken Madeira (Sautéed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese, Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce and Served with Mashed Potatoes), Miso Salmon (Fresh Miso Marinated Salmon Served with Snow Peas, White Rice (make it brown rice!!) and Miso Sauce), and the Chicken Di Pana (Lightly Breaded Sauteed Chicken Breast Served over a White Wine Butter Sauce with Mashed Potatoes and Broccoli).  The only plate I tried and didn't like was the Thai Lettuce Wraps (Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Coconut Curry Noodles and Lettuce Leaves with three (3) Spicy Thai Sauces - Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamarind-Cashew). I am a big fan of P.F. Chang's Lettuce Wraps and these lettuce wraps don't even compare. It is like night and day. I would never order them again. My favorite cheesecake is the Key Lime! Perfection.

Then came out our sandwich after hmmmm a good 30 minutes or so. Got this nice looking sandwhich that tasted not so nice! Let me start off by saying the chicken was disgusting! It was not chewable and no it wasn't dry something was just wrong with it. I was chewing chewing chewing and I couldn't swallow it! Then finally I drank water and somehow took my food down. Then my friend had the same exact problem. We both ate a little but got really disgusted! Oh and as a matter of fact it was not even busy. So I'm curious why my sandwich was made so poorly.

So this past Sunday, we randomly did and the food was surprisingly really freakin' good. For appetizer we got the fried zucchini, avadodo, and portobello mushroom basket. Seriously, no regret it was fantastic. I've only ever had fried avocado at a bar in hollywood and it's been years, so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this on the menu and had to get it. For dinner, my friend had the crusted salmon/ mash potatoes (they don't do roasted potatoes)/ and esparagus (lunch size). He loved it and it filled him up, so also surprisingly they were not at all greedy with their lunch portion. I had the mushroom burger with side salad. Vinagrette on the salad was light and not to sour or sweet, this is a total plus. my burger was B- because the bottom patty was soaked in grease and juice, however the texture was there for the rest of the burger and that's another plus. Even the bread they give you when you first sit down is really good... or maybe I was that hungry. Anyways, to sum this up, I would go again. Price was average for a $$ rating.  Why the 3/5 stars?  MENU needs to be edit down, a little overwhelming.  An even though they were way busy and not to blame our first server for ending her shift and the new server stepping in (though I felt like there shouldn't have been a 25 min gap from taking our drink orders and taking our food orders - - I get it, everyone was busy), it didn't help seeing a BUNCH of the waitresses just texting on their phones and socializing with each other. Why did I notice this, because I and tables around me were really waiting for a fair amount of time to be helped out.

Once again It was a disappointing experience. I have eaten at many Cheesecakes before and by far this location at the Americana is the worst. The waitress had a pleasant personality, however our food took a long time to come out, and when it did, it looked as though it had sat under the food warmer for at least 8 to ten minutes. My pasta was gummy and dry, with the sauce sucked out, and my guests potatoes on her breakfast dish were very dried out. The last persons dish was the best out of the 3, but the tacos were overly crisp and the meat looked dried out. We didn't have time to exchange things out because we were headed to a concert and couldn't wait. After reading many other reviews on this locations yelp page, I would hope that the management would take a more active role in the kitchen and dining room. Many things in the restaurant industry are forgivable ie, screaming kids (parents fault not the restaurants), Long wait (Welcome to Los Angeles deal with it, part of living here), Parking (Also part of just living in LA).  Now the ones that just can't happen if you want repeat customers is inattentive waitresses, overcooked or cold food, poor organizational skills, and constant mistakes. It's really not that hard for a customer like me.

I was told it would be another 10 minute wait equalling it to 50 minutes. Ten minutes turned into 25 minutes and we still did not get called in. It took us close to ten minutes to be greeted by a server. The manager Sarah, i personally do not believe deserves to be the restaurant manager. She was not friendly at all and did not give any importance to us. After we had waited 50 minutes to be seated, she told us she would go check on the status of the table and was gone for a good ten minutes. The front end representatives were on top of their work more than the manager herself. After going to the front couple of times, we were finally seated. After we sat down, sarah, the manager tried to move us around so she can fit another party of 8. Very unprofessional and rude. From my knowledge a manager should be the leader of the team and lead by example. She is a very bad example to her employees. Upper management should re-evaluate the manager of the store and choose a better person to serve its clients.  I know for a fact after today i will defenitely not give my business to this company.

It's in the Americana so you can either walk around as you're waiting for a table, or you can walk around after you eat because you will be so full. This place is always busy but I know why.  This is a great place to go for a romantic dinner because the ambience is dark and there are candles on the tables and if you sit outside there is a view of the fountain with the water show. You can also come here for group events or birthdays and they will sing happy birthday to you.  I always get some sort of pasta. Of course I love their bread as well not just because it's free, but the Brown bread with oats is my favorite because it is so fluffy and delicious with butter :-) my favorite is the four cheese pasta and the chicken marsala",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=160,2.88,3.06,3.26,3.3160000000000003,2.9880000000000004

I've been craving sliders like crazy but most places only have them on happy hour menus so I never seem to be able to get my hands on them.  We shared the kale salad from the starters menu and it was like 6 bucks and awesome. Perfect size. Most restaurant salads are expensive and huge and you can never finish them but taking it home is rarely an option. I got the Roadside Sliders and Ernie got the Fried Chicken Sliders. All great and awesome! The order is around $9 but it comes with FOUR (count 'em) sliders with pickles and you can add fries for a buck.

I asked the waiter if there had been a menu change, to which he replied simply ""yes"".  I told him I was very disappointed in the iceberg lettuce - nobody I know likes it anymore - had anyone else complained?  ""No.""  I asked, hypothetically, ""Why would they change a thing like that?!""  He replied, ""It was a decision by corporate."" So there you have it.  Worthless non-nutrition.  Tasteless food.  Not the best way to make money -- this place used to have lines out the door - 45 minute waits - and for good reason.  Now -- well I'm not giving them another chance.  It only takes one lousy meal to lose a long-time customer forever. PS-I asked him if they still had baby greens, to which he replied, yes they did (that and romaine (which is similar to iceberg, only slightly better in nutrition) and I asked him if he could bring me a small bowl of it and then I would be satisfied.  I was given a bowl of romaine.  I don't think he or the kitchen even knew what baby greens are anymore.  I could taste the fillers in my daughter's meatballs (breadcrumbs and low-quality beef with gristle) as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=380,3.0,3.02,3.248,2.8520000000000003,3.0120000000000005

But I suppose it is in Americana at Brand so it's usually pretty busy, regardless of the day. The food was good, surprisingly good, and the service was good too. Plus they validate parking. I was happy with all of that. But I do have a somewhat minor, and somewhat major gripe. Firstly, am I the only one who is irritated by the superfluous advertisements on the damn menu? What is that? Is Cheesecake Factory going out of business? Do they need to have all those advertisements for the income? It was sad. I haven't seen so many advertisements since the last time I clicked on an inappropriate website and was bombarded with pop ups. Not cool. My major gripe is that their suggested tips on the receipts are based off the total bill, not the subtotal like it's supposed to be. To me, that's a sneaky, dishonest, devious way of doing business and I don't like it. Makes me wonder what else they are doing.

372,Judith M.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,17,5.0,1.0,2015-10-22,"My parents came into town for a week and we were in the area so we thought this Cheesecake Factory would be a good choice since it was so conveniently where we were but boy were we wrong!  The hostesses are horrendous and very mean! It was a very hot Sunday and we only waited 25 minutes inside which wasn't bad at all. The bad part was after out timer lite up we got up from our seats and thought we would be seated right away, but instead they made us stand off to the side and wait for our table to be ready. 10 minutes of standing time had passed and my dad (who has a bad knee) was wincing. Since they made us get up (for no reason) after our timer lite up we had no where to sit for the remaining wait time. There was also a woman who had to be 7 months pregnant and her husband waiting for their table to be prepared after getting up when their timer went off as well.  I got a little frustrated and went up to the hostesses and asked when we were going to be seated stating that my dad had a bad knee and the 7 month pregnant woman shouldn't be standing unless the table was actually ready to have us seated. She turned to me, looked me up and down, sighed and said ""Well the tables aren't ready and I don't know how long it's going to be. They can wait a little longer."" She didn't even care at about the physical state of my dad and the poor pregnant woman! So appalling. I used to work in the service industry and that is not how you handle the situation at all. I then told her I just didn't understand why they buzzed us when they weren't even ready to seat us. She ignored me and just typed on the register. Then because I was annoying her they ended up seating me and my parents while they were still cleaning the table. The poor pregnant woman waited another 10 minutes to be seated and they were there before us!  Our waitress saved the day and made our meal more enjoyable but I still had a bad taste in my mouth that couldn't be fixed. I will never go to another Cheesecake Factory again and I will be advising my friends to eat at better managed places as well. The fact that the hostess thought she was better than everyone is just ridiculous.

Super delicious and flavorful. The chicken tequila pasta is also extremely creamy and delicious. The Luau (I believe is how you spell it) salad is incredible!!!! You MUST try that when you go there. It's an amazing sweet Chinese dressing with chips and all these good vegetables in there. Also, the fish tacos! They have a huge menu with pages and pages of food, you'll find something! This particular one is a beautiful location in the middle of the mall so you have a lot to do before and after you eat. The only problem I have with this branch specifically is the wait. It really is just too long. The problem is not even necessarily the level of busyness, it's the way they handle it. I would see 6-7 tables empty at a time waiting to seat people for 10-20 minutes. Tables should not be left empty when there is a line out the door. Service isn't that great when they get too busy, but it's still decent.

I didn't know this but they serve fresh strawberries with whipped cream. I don't exactly know what it is but their whipped cream is really good. It's not overly sweet and it's really fluffy. It really paired with the fresh strawberries. The sweet fluffy whipped cream and fresh tartness of the strawberries are a match made in heaven. It was so good!

970,Marianne A.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,58,,5.0,2016-01-05,"My first review was two stars because of the outside seating atmosphere - kids running around uncontrolled and throwing toys on the ground. This review is five stars because we ate lunch in the bar area late one afternoon and it was a completely different and really nice experience - because the bartender Katherine E and the guy bartender (whose name I didn't get) were friendly and fast and took great care of us. Saturday afternoon about 5pm after a movie and the line of customers waiting to check in with the hostess was lined up to the doors. When we got to the front we found that the wait was over an hour for two of us and would've been way longer for more people. Open seating is first come first served in the bar area but nothing was open. They were out of pagers so we were given a paper ticket to come back at a certain time.  We walked around the Americana for about thirty minutes and then wandered back to take another look at the bar area to see if anything had opened up in there. There were two stools at the very end of the bar top with a flat panel tv overhead and a good amount of space there, not crammed together. I have no clue why they were empty and why there was nobody else standing there waiting to snag anything that opened up. Lucky for us that we were only two and were glad to sit there.  When I went to take our name off of the list it was total chaos around the host/hostess stand -with the people with tickets trying to get to the stand to claim their arrival time right next to the people just arriving and trying to put their name on the list. I heard them saying to those just arriving that the wait was an hour and a half.  For our experience this time, it would've been worth an hour and a half wait. Katherine was the bartender who greeted us and laid out two clean white napkins like a tablecloth on the bar top when she found out we were going to be eating there with them. She and the other bartender were so welcoming and super nice to us even though they were slammed and taking care of drink orders for (I guess) the whole restaurant as well as for people in the bar - and punching in the food and making drinks and getting refills for those of us eating. The food runner guy was also really nice. Even though they were so busy, all of them seemed to really care about making it as good of an experience as possible for us and the rest of the customers - and I think most of us at the bar that afternoon were eating food, not just getting snacks or drinks.  To add to a really great experience, the food we ordered came out absolutely perfect - especially/even the burger - which can be hit or miss almost anywhere when you request it to be grilled medium and especially if the kitchen is jamming. The bread and butter basket was given to us just as if we had been at a table or booth. Factory Burger on wheat loaf with swiss cheese, sweet potato fries with chipotle mayo on the side, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - then we had two complimentary slices of cheesecake from gift cards so we got a slice of Godiva chocolate cheesecake and a slice of key lime cheesecake and took some of it home.  We live about thirty miles from here- this is the closest Cheesecake Factory to us - for whatever it's worth, we will totally come back here and try to get a spot at the bar top again !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=620,2.72,2.89,3.244,3.3480000000000003,2.822

The boyfriend and I decided to come here for a late lunch after shopping at 3pm. It was very crowded and there was half an hour wait. We decided to seat outside because it was such a beautiful day and we had a great view of the fountain. Our server, Simon was wonderful and quick to refill our drinks and meet our requests. We decided to share the Louisiana Chicken Pasta ($13.50) for the lunch special. Despite the dish being a smaller lunch portion, it was still plentiful. This is my absolute favorite pasta ever. The creamy sauce covering the bowtie pastas is delicious. Also, it's topped with sauteed mushrooms and chopped bell peppers. The best part is their crunchy, fried chicken on top of the pasta that's just splendid. I'm also a huge lover of cheese if you haven't noticed yet, so I definitely had the waiter spend a couple of minutes covering my pasta with parmesan cheese. My pasta was basically covered with snow! To pair with the pasta, the complimentary bread is great with anything with a sauce-base. I especially enjoy their honey oat bread, which is what I crave most from The Cheesecake Factory. To end our meal, we shared the White Chocolate Macadamia Caramel Cheesecake ($7.95). I was a little disappointed with the cheesecake as the nuts were too much for me and lacked a true cheesecake texture. I'd be surprise if you didn't go home with leftovers from here as to why we shared our meals. It was more than enough for the two of us, which left us in a food coma right after.

I ordered the Parmesan Garlic bread and the Asian potstickers. I really don't know what happened - just everything seemed so mediocre and half-heartedly prepared (as well as served). Perhaps it was my fault for ordering potstickers from this establishment, but I didn't think it was possible for them to be as awful as they were; the filling, chicken, was very dry, and the sauce seemed desperate to overcompensate for the other flaws in the dish, and honestly, even that was just all over the place, trying way too hard, and failing just as hard, if not harder.  The garlic bread, which I usually love so much, was mostly burnt at the ends, with just lazy presentation.

At this point two plates with hair in it didn't really earn our trust that other plates wouldn't have hair in it too. So declined the free food. We had 3 birthdays on our party and really didn't want to spoil the mood so we just left it at that. I think if we had made it a bigger deal we would have not had to pay for those plates.

131,Jason C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,23,,4.0,2016-02-03,"The pyramid of flavor power.  We all know this place offers, from the top down, everything under the food chain arranged with inspiration from every corner of the globe...on one menu. Then bread and butter and/or oil and balsamic on request, and dammit if that bread isn't addicting. Tall glasses of any beverage that make bringing Europeans here a real treat.  Cheesecake pioneered gluttony in the 1980's (as far as I knew, but '78 upon looking it up) when they began as a sandwich shop in Bev's Hills. Big sandwich's, then big portions became all the rage. And it was good. I'm here to report it still is today.  Speaking of the bread, it was about a year or two ago I noticed they changed the yeast they were using to produce the sourdoughs, which made a HUGE difference in the structure and flavor of the bread. How the hell they implement that across 180 or so locations is probably a news segment worthy of producing, and an surprisingly interesting one to watch.  When we think of chain restaurants, the title is not one of glamour. So how is a chain restaurant defined? 5 restaurants? 10? It's technically 2 or more, with a unified architecture regarding both the type of food, and sometimes the construction of the building. Cheesecake therefor qualifies. But that does not make it bad.  In fact, the chicken parm sandwich was served on this new sourdough, with their perfect tenderized and fried chicken (yet why the fried chicken salad was taken away I'll never know), and very tomato-y marinara, making it a great sandwich. Sitting at the bar allowed for an insight into the bartender's life in a 300+ seat restaurant pouring enormous drinks. Busy. Yet still the service was exemplary. Yes. That stupid word. Mostly because ""great"" sounds like when someone describes someone as ""neat"", but when they mean it in a good way. The guac was solid too. Really. Chicken wings, just right. Not reinvented, but done well. People are surprised when I say this. Why do people have to hate? Because of the butter thing? Sure, they put butter in everything. And when it can't be butter, it is another fat the vegans and vegetarians can all agree on. But so what? Isn't this what those diners that we all love to love because we find something charming in their dinginess offer the world? Okay, I lost some of you there, but that is fine. Those left standing probably agree: It's a Jersey diner on a national level. And it's good. Just bring back the fried chicken salad. I realize it's not a healthy salad. That's not why I go to a place named after the most fattening form of dessert ever invented - sugary cream with a buttered graham cracker crust. Or keep coming up with new dishes.  I'm a fan.

As for my BF he has the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp with chicken. He was very disappointed because his nationality is Jamaican and, it was nothing like a Jamaican dish because it was missing the flavor and spices. Instead it said it was on the sweeter side I guess with the mango salsa. He said the rice was hard and the actual best thing on the plate was the Plantains.

When we complained that the wait had almost doubled from the estimate the hostess with the curly hair said well we are only 10 minutes over your wait ( in reality it was 20 minutes).

I have frequented the marina del Rey location my entire life and have visited other CCFs so I thought this one was a sure thing. I get restaurants get hectic and servers/ hostess' are under all sorts of pressure but the way the hostess & manager spoke to us today was so ridiculous. We were composed and just wanted to understand why after we handed our pager in we had to wait another 40 minutes.  She acted as if we asked her something personally offensive. She obviously forgot about us but instead of speaking to us like an adult she threw a tantrum. This young woman -Jackie-threw up her arms and rolled her eyes as if we were screaming at her. We were finally seated by a super overly nice hostess. I cannot stress enough that we didn't need coddling. We had normal laid back questions met with the worst attitudes. The manager Daniel came to speak to us and was just as bad as Jackie. He didn't care about anything we had to say. Just sucks since now I live near this Cheesecake Factory and I can never visit it as I don't won't to deal with such a wait staff.

Change my clothes and shoes and get back... And .... Still no food. Clock was about 21 and we had 3 kids that were pretty tired. 2 hours and 30 mins our food starts arriving, but not for all at once, so some of us are done before the last ones have had any food at all.

When we left we were told we could have 2 pieces of cheesecake... And the waiter insisted on a tip... What a nerve. Everything was terrible and then still wanting extra money.

29,Vanessa M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1210,766,2685.0,3.0,2016-07-08,"I'm not one to ever come to American chained restaurants, but it was for a gf's late bday dinner and she wanted something very simple and casual so what bday girl wants, bday girl gets haha. Since she lives near the area we chose this location, and it's great since there are many stores, as it's right in Americana mall. You can park in the parking structure, and make sure to validate at the restaurant. The inside is pretty big, a bit dim on the lighting. Very casual and relaxed setting and a small bar area in the entrance. As you are seated they give you complimentary breads. I love the oat bread. It's dark colored, like chocolate, and tasted sweet. Kind of remind me of the sweet oat bread from Subway. It comes out a tad warm and so soft. Along with some sourdough bread that is okay but not close to the oat bread. And lots of individual butter. We got another round of bread as we finished the first round first, and I must add it's dangerous because I already started to get pretty full and it's the perfect combo of carbs and sugar :) The menu is pretty big, they have such a huge selection and it's great for families since they have something that everyone can enjoy, all with different taste. I also like how they have a separate low calorie food menu. My gf's and I ordered a bottle of their pinot noir. It was slightly dry, but a nice aroma and smooth. _Endive Salad. Belgian Endive, Radicchio, Glazed Pecans, Blue Cheese and Vinaigrette. My gf usually gets this when she comes here, and I can see why. It's a perfect small salad to start off with. The salad is refreshing but really carries and overpowering and pungent flavor from the blue cheese so make sure not to grab too much as a little goes a long way. Pairs nicely with the candied pecans, for some sweetness and balances well with the cheese and slight bitterness from the radicchio. All the ingredients go well together and the dressing is nicely sweet and tossed easily, which I appreciate. _Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. Shrimp and Chicken Sautéed with Onions, Tomato and Peppers in a Very Spicy Cajun Sauce. All on Top of Fresh Linguini. My 2 gf's split this. I tried a bite and it was pretty good, but way too spicy for my liking. It had a real strong pepper aftertaste. The shrimp was nicely cooked and it seemed they put good amounts of it as well. Nothing amazing but if you like spicy this is a safe pasta dish.  _Skinnylicious Soft Tacos. Three Soft Corn Tortillas Filled with Spicy Chicken or Shrimp, Avocado, Tomato, Onions, Cilantro and Crema. Served with Escabeche Vegetables. I ordered this from the skinnylicious menu. I got chicken. It comes with all the toppings on the tacos but I asked for it all on the side. Good amount for 1 person or 2 to share. It was okay, I've had better tacos elsewhere, and was not really expecting much. The chicken was overcooked and dry and very bland in flavor. They barely gave enough toppings for all 3 toppings, especially the avocados, they really skimped on that. The best part of this dish was the escabeche vegetables. It was pickled cucumbers and cauliflower, that was refreshing sweet and acidic.  _Tiramisu. Italian Custard Made with Mascarpone, Whipped Cream, Lady Fingers, Marsala and Coffee Liqueur. Topped with Whipped Cream and Ground Chocolate. Surprsingly, pretty good. I know it's cheesecake factory but none of us were in the mood for cheesecake, but actually all agreed on tiramisu. It was great, but holly jeeeeeezzzz..... can you put any more whipped cream in the plate?! I couldn't tell if the dessert was the whopped cream or tiramisu. One whip would have been enough. Nothing like taking a classic great dessert and smothering and over killing it with cheap american sugar. There was barely any ground chocolate as they mentioned. I would get this, just ask for easy on the whip cream. Nothing to rave about, and I would not come here again, unless someone wanted to go for their birthday haha.

135,Zachary K.,"Tarzana, Los Angeles, CA",6,4,1.0,1.0,2016-07-20,"Normally I would be giving this place a 5 Star rating but just got some of the worst customer service from a worker who claims to be the manager named Kevin. Though I believe that one worker should not determine the rating of an entire restaurant, let this be a wake up call to whoever decides to read my experience. So to give a little detail on the situation: I call in to place a take-out order for my little sister who works inside of the Americana, who at the time happened to be getting off from her night shift at 10:30. She was extremely hungry so I wanted to set up an order for when she got out to walk over and pick up. When calling in I spoke with a guy named Andre who kindly transferred me to the Bakery so I can place my take out order.  After waiting almost 5 minutes on hold, this guy Kevin picks up and right off the bat is rushing me to place my order. I tell him what I want and without giving me a chance to speak another word he goes ahead and puts my order into the kitchen. And this is before I could mention that I wanted it set for 10:30 pick-up. Following this just before he is about to hang up the phone I barely slip in my directions for the order , only then he claims that its late and that it will be ready in 10-15 minutes. Long story short, after an argument over the simple fact that I want the food to be prepared at 10:30 so it is not cold he rudely argues back saying it was my fault that I did not mention it before, and that he was going to see what he could do. I told him go ahead do what u can and hung up feeling disgusted with the service I just received. So I had to call back in and get a manager on the phone and sure enough he is the one to answer. When I realize this , I ask to be transferred to a manager, and he claims to be it. So I straight up let him know that is no way to treat a customer before I cut the conversation short and got off the phone. To wrap things up without going in more detail, I am writing this review in disgust of the fact that someone like that answers the phone for take out orders. I feel sorry for the company if more situations like this happen to others when calling in to place an order. Anyhow I will leave it at that . Take care !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=340,2.72,3.07,3.064,2.116,2.9299999999999997

888,Daisy S.,"El Segundo, CA",0,7,,2.0,2016-10-10,"Sunday October 2, 2016 at 2pm my family and I (a party of 8 consisting of 4 adults and 4 children) arrived at the Cheesecake Factory for my early birthday lunch, 2:04pm we were put on the waiting list with an approximate seating time of 30 minutes. It was a beautiful sunny evening so naturally we waited outside to enjoy it. Surprisingly, by 2:18pm we received a call letting us know our table was ready. We rushed back, we were seated within 15 minutes.  Our server Nikki L was extremely pleasant and attentive. We ordered appetizers as soon as we sat down. Shortly after we ordered our Entrees. We were enjoying ourselves too much to notice any prolonged delays in food arrival, so I will say it was a moderate wait. Again, Nikki L came by checking on us numerous times being extremely attentive. Food was great, no complaints even from our most finicky eaters: the kids. Soon after finishing our food Nikki L graciously offered dessert we were so full of yummy food we almost declined, but who goes to the Cheesecake Factory and not have cheesecake? Simply Unheard of. Sometime after placing the order for dessert Nikki L and 2 of her best voiced coworkers came out to sing the awaited birthday song. While working on dessert a man approached our table telling us to leave table, using offensive language. It is hard to describe the disbelief we were in after this, in total shock. We were frightened. The kids were nervous and confused. We asked for the check immediately after this. Nikki L picked up on the mood change at our table and proceeded to ask why. I described the incident, she immediately apologized. Grateful she did this, however she has no control on what goes on at the front desk. She went on to let her manager know.  Within a few minutes the Manager Bentley came over and sat next to me asking me to describe the incident. So I did just that; her facial expressions changed as I described what happened going from empathetic to ""Oh I know exactly who you are talking about, man in a white collared shirt low haircut. Yes, he did tell me he was going to come over here and tell you guys to leave as he also has a big party and is desperate to be seated we laughed about it ,but I am not going to seat him here anyway I am going to seat him there"" as she pointed to the tables behind us. I was not sure if I had understood correctly so I asked her directly, ""You knew this aggravated man was going to come to our table, and you didn't let him know that was unacceptable?"" to which she replied without hesitation ""Yes but it could have been a joke"" to which I responded with a simple ""Thank you"" She continued with apologies but again I said ""thank you"". I was in utter disbelief that she knew beforehand and took it so lightly. Nikki L came by again bringing the copies of the receipts. She asked if the manager had come by and I said yes, went on to let her know Bentley already knew so it only made me feel worse. She was so upset on the manager's reaction to the event she insisted on letting the general manager know. Rick stopped by gave his apologies for the 2 incidents and assured me this is not a reflection on The Cheesecake Factory.  We are ready to go and move on with our day, as we are walking out the man in the white shirt is at the door and immediately begins to yell out offensive words and approaches the only male adult in our group calling him out to engage in a physical altercation. This causes havoc. Thankfully we were able to walk out without being physically hurt.  As I reflect on this I think perhaps if the Bentley would have taken a more serious approach and had not made a joke out of letting an aggravated impatient man approach our table. Why joke about something so invasive and downright rude. Is there a Policy in place for situations like this? Was this a racial issue? Why did she not care? *****I sent corporate office a message the day after the fact a whole week went by and no response.*****",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=300,2.2,2.86,2.952,2.536,2.596

I ordered the pepperoni and it looked fine when it came out. I started to eat it and then I noticed that it had some sort of strange smell, so I smelled it and I thought it maybe was just a different pepperoni. I started to smell the rest of the pizza, such as the cheese and crust. I couldn't put my finger on it because the entire pizza smelled like this item. After eating half of the pizza, we realized that it probably smelled like bleach. I was worried I was going to get sick, so I kind of stopped eating it but then I thought well it means they clean but maybe they spilled bleach into the crust or something.

They are absolutely delicious.  Their salad dressings are so good! I especially like the spicy peanut-cilantro vinaigrette which comes on the Santa Fe Salad. It has a nice kick to it.  I've had takeout salads from here. Their takeout containers are large sturdy plastic containers. Takeout portions are the same as eating in.

520,Jenine S.,"Los Angeles, CA",315,36,15.0,1.0,2016-11-23,"11/23/2016. The day before thanksgiving. My boyfriend and I ate the Cheesecake Factory in Glendale. We arrived at the bar at 10pm (an hour before closing). We were waited on by VINCENT. Knowing the risks associated by sitting at the bar (low, minimum face to face interaction) we were ready to just order and eat. I myself ordered a Kobe burger and my boyfriend ordered chicken tikka masala, along with two pineapple Moscow mules. There was another couple next to us, also at the bar, who arrived AFTER us and got their bread basket arrived BEFORE us. That was the first red flag- starving as we were, we were quick to notice this discrepancy.  Brushing it off and attributing it to being ""rush hour"" for serving/dinner time, we disregarded this.  What really pushed our buttons was not being asked how our meal was AT ALL, NOT ONCE after receiving it. We are both servers, so we understand how it gets when it's busy, but when you ask the couple next to us who arrived AFTER US how their food is, we take it personally. We usually tip 30% and LOVE Cheesecake Factory, but will probably NOT be back after this experience. Living in LA, there are plenty of better options.  Avoid the bartender VINCENT at the GLENDALE CHEESECAKE FACTORY.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=280,3.04,2.64,2.996,1.924,2.8000000000000003

She gave us some excuse about it being baked fresh and went over to chat with Jennifer B, another waitress. They gabbed, they bitched loudly about some customer, they checked their phones and receipts. After asking again, we finally got our soggy, cold bread after we got our meal. No apologies. No fresh baked bread. Our waitress never returned. No explanation that she went on break or wherever. We were just suddenly served by Jennifer B who gave us minimal attention.  Staff, Omar, was the only saving grace. He was kind, attentive when asked for something (mustard) and worked feverishly.

This is by far the worst service out of every single one of them! Seated fairly quickly and we were a party of 5...then the wait begins. We wait, and wait....and a waitress comes by to greet us and take drink orders. 4 waters and a Diet Coke takes 20 minutes to come back to us, and the waitress tells us she's handing us off to a colleague. That's fine, we'd just like to order food please. He tells us he'll be ""right"" back. We shouldn't have let him leave. He returns another 15 minutes later to take our food order. Mind you, a few managers have shown up on the floor to start directing patrons to tables and put out fires between servers. I don't know what was going on, but it seemed extra chaotic and somewhat unprofessional being that we were watching these conversations unfold before us.  Food comes out half an hour later, no joke, and with apologies from the server and the manager who accompanied him to our table. We ate very fast as we had limited shopping time and didn't think this ordeal would take so long.  Asked for boxes to pack up what we couldn't eat and our waiter offered to do it for us. We politely declined since we assumed that would take another 30 minutes. Almost...we had to wait another 15 minutes for our boxes and the check.

Came here about 3 weeks ago with my sister, we live in the area and I was craving pasta so we said why not. After coming here I was reminded why I NEVER come here..... It was a Thursday night, we went in and there were about 3 or 4 parties ahead of us waiting to be seated but they were big parties. We walked up to the host at the counter. He completely IGNORED us. It was an African tall guy, not sure what his name was. We were literally right in his face and he was ignoring us, no hi, no how can I help you. Hell, even just saying ""I'll be with you in a moment"" would suffice. NOPE. Ignored us for about 2 minutes until my sister got upset and said ""Hello? Can you help us????"" and he was like ""What do you need?"" WTF? You saw us walk in, what do you possibly think we need? We want to be seated! My sister asked how long the wait was and he asked us how many, she said two. He said ""No wait, I'll seat you guys in a minute"". 5 minutes had gone by and my sister was raging pissed and she walked over and said ""Are you going to seat us now?"" and he was like ""There's 2 parties ahead of you it's going to be about 20 minutes"". Why did you lie and say it would be a minute when you just came back with saying a 20 minute wait. What an idiot. We walked out pissed off and ate somewhere else. Worst service ever. OK, there was no one at the counter when we approached him, he couldn't acknowledge our existence? Worst attitude ever too ""What do you need"". Whatever. If you hate your job no one is forcing you to work there - just quit. A week ago I ordered through Uber Eats because I was craving pasta and my sister wanted a burger. Order came in an hour. I ordered the Cajun Shrimp and Chicken Pasta because supposedly it's like the ""Best thing on the menu"" NOPE. Disgusting. Probably the worst pasta I have ever tasted in my entire life. Bland, and something I could have made for $5 bucks getting all the ingredients at a store. The noodles were nasty and the chicken had so much cartilage I wasted every piece of chicken. It's still lingering on my palette honestly. $18.50 for this pasta has got to be the most insulting joke ever. $18.50 for something that tastes like a wet diaper. No thanks. NEVER AGAIN.

If you're looking for a place for brunch, don't eat here.  Although Cheesecake Factory's evening service is usually passing, especially considering their high volume, their Sunday brunch service reeks of a non-committal attitude by the staff, broken management, and a dispassionate kitchen team.  In a single meal, the restaurant broke several best practice rules in restaurant operation, leaving me to believe the business is struggling with how to provide service during their non-peak hours. Burnt food, forgotten drink orders, cold potatoes, and a confrontational waitress round out a number of cardinal sins committed by the brunch team which will go down as one of the worst I've ever seen.  I could go into greater detail, but when the chef plates a charred english muffin under a cold eggs benedict, a server brings it to the table, and a manager still charges you for the meal, you've got serious back-end problems plaguing what could otherwise be an enjoyable, high quality brunch.   My advice to you is to go somewhere else.

Let it be noted that our party of three entered your location during an off hour time today while your waiting area was practically empty (so empty that I was not given a pager and was only asked for my name). Customers who we knew were before us were being called by name and were taken to tables. As new customers entered the restaurant requesting for tables your hosts began handing out pagers. Still waiting for our table, noticing that now only customers who have pagers were being called to be seated, I approached a male host and explained that I was there earlier and not given a pager but only my name. He checked the computer, looked and me, then handed me a pager and told me it would be a 15 minute wait. I returned to my party and informed them of our status and we were in disbelief. Our party had already waited 30 minutes before the rush of new customers came in. Then to have the new customers seated before us, the apathetic attitude of the male host, and being told we had additional wait time for a table, our party chose to leave.

The Chicago location left a bad taste in my mouth and so I figured I'd given it a second chance, and to my dismay nothing changed.   [Server]: Our server was awesome, super nice and chill. Beard game was strong too, looked like he cut lumber for recreation.  [Food]: So I ordered the Chicken Marsala and I was slightly disappointed with the integrity of the dish. The chicken was vapid in flavor, there was absolutely no real good seasonings or rubs applied. The pasta wasn't cooked all the way so it was more chewy than what it should have been, and the sauce glazed over was bland. There was a better party in my glass of chianti than that whole dish.  [Atmosphere]: So this place throws me off. Because it's located in the Americana, so it comes off upscale but then you step inside and it's total opposite. The Cheesecake Factory needs to figure out how it wants to be perceived. The aesthetic of your restaurant comes off classy but if I step inside and close my eyes it sounds like I'm in Red Robin. Maybe Cheesecake doesn't wanna be considered fine dining? Maybe I'm wrong? Maybe it's Maybelline? Anyway, if you are trying to come across fine dining, you missed your mark. Between the overcrowded seating, loud ambience, and the allowance of baby high chairs in-between tables gives it that glorified Olive Garden feeling.  [Overall]: Sorry, won't be returning.

These fine people had been fully depleted by the long and arduous day of parading around the Glendale Americana like prize ponies at the county fair and they deserved a hero's welcome and a hero's feast. As the servants scurried out of their holes, their arms weak under the massive silver platters and their bodies starved and shaking from their Cheesecake Factory-prescribed daily meal of brine and amphetamine, they made their way to the tables to unleash the cornucopia. The servants presented their vessels in solemn reverence and with eyes cast down for fear of incurring the wrath of their noble guests. The floor vibrated from the sheer turbulence of the collective feeding and could surely have been felt in all the far reaches of the Americana. Chairs buckled, tables creaked and clothing was torn asunder as the orgy of consumption came to a boil. Chunks of indiscernible organic matter burst forth in all directions like a food grenade, splattering the faces of the servants as they stood like cemetery gargoyles, guarding the frenzy, hiding their tears, and biding their time. The eye of the storm came to the Cheesecake Factory like a morphine drip to a recent amputee. The nobles inevitably hit their critical mass and had to pause to digest and let their pre-installed insulin pumps do their job.

As a middle class father, I was on a short 1hr lunch when I decided to go to cheescake. I was seated right aeay(which was great) and they brought the bread out for me to nimble on while Tiffany assists the other 19 tables outside. The bread? Cold, hard and bland.. did not tastle like the bread I had at any other cheesecake factory. The  black bread that they serve is usually phenomenal, but for some reason todays bread was very dry.. About 20 minutes after theu brought the bread, Atiffany came and took my order. I ordered 2 kobe beef patties on a plate of salad. I asked for medium.................. and asked Tffany to make sure it is medium.......... after 55 minutes waiting for 2 beef patties, Tiffany came by with the plate.. sure enough, it was well done. They tried telling me it was medium well, but it was clearly well done as there was not even a small hint of red. I told her I hate it, and the ""manager"" came out.. Hello, whats wrong? Said the manager(like you would to a baby) i said I hate it.. i told him I would not eat a well done patty when I specificslly asked for medium.. his response?? Well your free to go.. and he walked away.. Best hour spent of my life.. hungry, tired, and annoyed. I will NEVER return to this location.

Of course it was going to be busy. But go to the desk, put your name down, get their estimate and mentally at 15 minutes, take the little buzzer and walk away from the immediate area. Find a quiet spot in the waiting area if you can, or break ranks and leave the family behind and do some shopping while they wait. What you don't do is constantly go to the desk asking for an update or make a big deal about how long the queue is. People got there before you, deal with it, the hostesses don't need for you to give them a hard time. As it was for us, I managed to get a little shopping done at the Apple store and Barnes and Noble during the 30-minute wait (on the dot! No extension to their estimate). And we were taken to our booth and a high chair was brought for my niece. Good service from the waitress, not great but she did have a very busy section. Menus were looked at and dishes chosen, a mixture of appetisers and entrees. These were ordered and delivered in good time, and the table quickly got crowded with plates, which were quickly whisked away once emptied. Their spinach and artichoke dip is great, although the nachos were slightly too big for a non double dipper. They were definitely two biters. The egg roll platter didn't do anything for me although lots of tables were ordering it. The mains looked great and were apparently very tasty, I got the bang bang chicken and shrimp, which was great. Thai spices, peanut sauce, good amounts of chicken and quite a few shrimp (although I'd have preferred more shrimp, less chicken) and a nice load of vegetables. It was a bit much though and I was happy sharing it with other members of my family. No cheesecake eaten at the cheesecake factory, but I learned a long time ago that you can either eat a main course or a dessert there, never both if you want to continue functioning!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=60,2.88,2.76,2.908,2.388,2.808

Today's lunch experience wasn't as pleasant as our other visits. Once our buzzer went off, we went up to the front to get seated. They took our buzzer and had us stand and wait for another five minutes while they were seating others.. which defeats the purpose of the buzzer but whatever. When it was our turn we found out that they had inputted our information incorrectly (requested a table for 3, they inputted a table for 2). Instead of apologizing, he rudely told us that we'd have the next table and just moved on to seating other tables. I'm assuming he wasn't a host or waiter because he was dressed in more professional attire than the others. What a damn shame it is- you'd think he'd make an effort to be a prime example of customer service.

Literally every part of our dinner was flawed in some way. When they called our name to sit at a table, we walked to the table and it was taken, so our hostess had us wait while she walked around and looked for an open one. More waiting on top of our 45 min initial wait to get seated.  The food was even worse. We ordered the Korean fried cauliflower and the salmon scampi combo and they were absolutely horrible. The sauce on the cauliflower was choking. Granted, we didn't pick a grant dish. The asparagus in our salmon dish was cold and the shrimp was fried, but it had been soaked in the dish for too long because we had to wait so long so it had become soggy. The salmon was okay.  THEN on top of our already very slow service, their gift card system was down so it took another 10 minutes to process is by hand.

I could probably say that I've almost tried all of the different flavors. My favorite dish is the pasta da vinci, can't really describe what's in it except that it was chicken and mushrooms and the sauce is amazing! Service is always amazing, the waiters I always get are attentive and make sure we're doing okay.  I decided to try something new and got the chicken riesling and it was delicious - it was a butter pasta with this wine sauce around it with chicken and bacon and some other stuff. I mixed the sauce into my pasta and it made it even better. If you're looking for something to drink, I would either get strawberry lemonade as a non-alcoholic drink, or if you're looking for something with alc, then the Long Island ice tea is the way to go. I came on a good night (Thursday around 9) and was seated within 10 minutes. Glendale has been so busy that sometimes the wait times are almost 2 hours, which is ridiculous!!!

209,Katie L.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",0,1,1.0,1.0,2017-05-30,"I've never left a review at yelp before, but I think have to leave one now. I have to say that I really like the cheesecake factory restaurants however I think this is the worst location. This is my second time dining in here at the Americana and I had the worst experiences for both. First time here, there was a roach on our table. We were so disgusted and lost appetite and so we decided to leave without finishing 1/4 of our dishes. We called the manager, but as he tried to catch it it disappeared behind the seat we were seating. He couldn't catch it and it made us to feel more disgusted. I didn't leave a review at that time because the manager told us that we didn't have to pay for our bill. That was about 6 months ago.  I thought I'd never coming back to this store, but we came shopping yesterday to Americana and my friends wanted to dine here. So we dined here for the second time yesterday. This time, it was the quality of food and service we received that disappointed us. Our server seemed like he's been working for only few months and seemed very unprofessional. It took him forever to get what we asked for. We didn't even get the utensils until we received our first dish. We asked for new side plates since some of the plates given were dirty. He came back with wet dishes which seemed like he tried poured some water on them. We were really hungry and stressed by long waiting. We didn't want to get stressed by complaining and the attitude of our server made us speechless. So we decided to just wipe the dishes and eat. We ordered a pasta davinci and a hibachi steak. Pasta da vinci was very dry and tasted like nothing and very oily on the bottom. Hibachi steak was all burnt. We were so disappointed because these two are our favorites from the restaurant and we know how it's supposed to taste like. I really wanted to like this place because we come here often to shop and we really like the restaurant, but these two experiences, I think I'll never come back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=220,2.72,2.72,2.792,2.308,2.72

And for the most part there is no in between. My girlfriend and I are both not big on the Cheesecake Factory. We said since we've never had it together that we should try it.  After our meal there we are sticking to our no Cheesecake Factory rule.  This location is pretty cool and big. They have a lot of patrons that frequent here. The staff seemed to be on it and they seated us rather quickly even with them being busy. As you know they have a huge menu. Which can be kind of a down side because that leaves no room for pictures and too many different dishes for the chefs to make. But it is what it is.  I orders the truffle honey chicken which sounded amazing but it was blah. It reminded you chicken fried steak with a honey glaze. The coating on the chicken was overly sweet and falling off. So I had to scoop the mash, chicken n the coating to the effect. The mash potatoes were the savior of that dish.  My girlfriend ordered some other chicken dish which was not to bad but heavy on the lemon sauce. That was was ok. We also had the sweet corn tamale cakes. Those are so good. They like made up for the blah meals.  All in all I'm not gonna trash the restaurant because they have a good clientele and rep but it's not for me. Like I said this chain is a hit and miss.

The food isn't the absolute Michelin-rated best, which is expected at chain restaurants, but it's good enough to go back.  Some favorites: *Tex mex egg rolls *Barbecue ranch chicken salad (which will be drenched in dressing if you don't specify otherwise) *Nachos *Of course, their cheesecakes (big enough to share with 2 people) And in all honesty, you're safe getting any of the menu items and being happy with the food.

But here is one of my lowest experiences dining here. Wait time was short, surprisingly. 15-20 minutes for a table of 3. We followed the hostess to our table and was seated, then assuming our waitress comes and already asks for our drinks without giving us some time. Didn't give us a name, which would of been nice.  While looking at the menu she comes back and takes our drink orders. Comes back with them and see if we're ready to order. My little brother already knew his order so he ordered first while we continued to look at the menu. Suddenly another waiter comes and doesn't introduce us, neither does the first waitress informs our new waiter. Anyway, he came in sounding like he just wants us to order already so we did. As time went by, we noticed everyone else receiving the complimentary bread that is usually served while we wait for our food but this time around we had to ask one of the waiters/waitresses if we can have some. My brother then receives his brunch combo, I'd give it a 9/10 because the waffles the substituted were spot on. My mother and I split a Kobe Burger, it was cooked the way we wanted it with sweet potato fries so I'd give it 9.5/10. Overall, I gave them a 3/5 mainly due to the service. First of all, we had a waitress at first then a waiter and never got informed their name. Second, neither asked if we needed anything else as for condiments or more water. Lastly, neither one came to our table after we received our food to see how it is.

Everything is just horrible. Regardless of the day or time you will have to wait even if there are tables open. They always stick us in this tiny corner by the wall with chairs which SUCK and are very uncomfortable. We came here last week again to give it 1 last shot and it was completely horrifying. My girlfriend got the steak and ordered it medium well with potatoes. Her steak came out so well done it was super hard and black. She had a very hard time cutting it and she was chewing it as if they left it on the stove for 30 min. My orange chicken was okay but the rice itself wasn't fully cooked and tasted very starchy. We told our waiter and he apologized and took it back. We had to ask a different waiter for water because our server was so slow to return and it wasn't very busy either it was on a weekday. 25 min went by and no steak. He said they were cooking it as fast as they could...now I don't know about you but I can cook a steak on my tiny BBQ with 1 single propane tank in about 10 minutes especially how thin it was. The man returned after and still no steak and offered her a salad/soup. She asked for a salad and they brought her a tiny garden salad that was OLD!!! The leaves were stale and turning purple and tasted gross!!!  Another 10 minutes went by and by that time she had finished the orange chicken with me and her steak came. It was cooked great this time and the potatoes tasted fresh. We waited for our check for so long. He did not offer to take off any items or to discount anything and there was not a manager in site. Horrible customer service. We even ordered a cheesecake to go and even that wasn't on the house.... he charged us for 2 steaks since they had to make 2 and he had to have his manager take off 1 so we still payed for the steak. The best thing about this place was the free bread. That's pretty sad.....and even the white bread was super old and hard just the black ones were great. We will never return here and I was so embarrassed to take my girl here. We were here a total of 2.5hrs for a steak and orange chicken and we ordered waters....

Then the manager offered me free dessert. Really how about firing the dame fool who doesn't know how to do his job. Then the second time one of the servers cleaning the table next to me spills juice on me and walks away never apologizing and the waiter witnessed it and he said sorry never had the lady come back and at least apologize.

They were closing, although I was the only person in line, basically the counter informed me until they figured I was not going to go away and finally took my order and waited an additional 5 mins for them to give it to me! The slice was in the box, all it needed was it's signature whipped cream. Although the guy that took my order walked away and when he came back, realized I was still standing there and then gave me my order! When I sat down to enjoy my slice, I had a runny whipped cream that was spattered all over the place and ruined the presentation and quite frankly the slice because it was basically milk pour over it!!!

236,Sami S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,111,302.0,1.0,2017-08-14,"Seriously folks, this was the very first time that I have ever stepped foot in a Cheesecake Factory, and probably will be the last time. I always thought of the Cheesecake Factory much like the Spaghetti Factory but just one step higher, but now I think of it as just a 1/2 step higher. The reason for our big discount on my receipt was that my guest had to complain about the broken glass under our table near his feet (someone before us broke a glass salt shaker).  When my guest mentioned the glass under our table to the waiter at the time we placed our dinner order, the waiter looked under our table saying ""OMG!"" but he never brought anyone over to clean up the broken glass.  When our dinner plates finally arrived they gave my guest only 2 small shrimps with the rest chicken chunks and pasta. My guest complained to the waiter and the dinner server about not having enough shrimp, so the waiter requested some more shrimp. When the shrimp (just 4 more pieces) finally came 15 minutes later my guest food had gotten cold. When he asked if they have a microwave to re-heat his plate the waiter said, ""Sorry, we do not have a microwave."" I then offered to the waiter buy this place a $13 microwave at Big Lots. The waiter thought that was funny. When I told to waiter to ""Just blow on his dinner to make it hot again"" he just laughed again and thought that was funny too.   My guest left a bit upset about his dinner and having to take his dinner home in a doggie bag, but I have to say that I did warn him ahead of time about choosing to go to this place for dinner since I saw the low rating of this location.    On the other hand, my dinner was just ""okay"" but bland tasting and a bit luke-warm. I did not complain about anything during our time at this place because my friend was doing all the complaining about this place himself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=40,2.64,2.74,2.696,2.34,2.7

86,Chris C.,"Los Angeles, CA",145,211,1041.0,1.0,2017-08-24,"Tamara's actions lead me to believe that she's a novice manager. I'm definitely disappointed with my experience here, tonight. I used to frequent this location. However, after tonight's experience, I don't know that I'll be coming back anytime real soon. Unfortunate. The dish that I ordered was supposed to come with both pasta and chicken.  The chicken was to be breaded after it was pounded to death, to make it thin and easy to cook. Anyway, the chicken was presented to me in pieces, looking like someone had taken it possibly to a different table, it being cut into and then taking it back to bring it to my table.  Anyway, it was definitely not what I'd received in previous visits.  I explained to the manager that the plating alone made it very unappetizing.  So, she offered to take it back and to have a new one made.  I said that would be OK.  After a few moments, she brought my dish back to me and showed me that it was OK and that I was basically sending back a dish that was perfectly fine.  Why would you do that? I told you that I was disgusted by the appearance of the dish and yet you bring it back to me. Why? To say that I was wrong and throw it in my face? Not cool!  This was not the best performance from this particular manager.  You don't bring the dish back and try and prove to the customer that the manager or kitchen staff were right, and not you.  It took forever for my replacement to come and just before it did, I told them to forget my order and just remove it from my bill.  By the time that I'd just finished saying that, the dish appeared behind the manager.  I told them I still didn't want it and that my experience there had just been miserable and embarrassing even.  I don't appreciate behavior like that. So, I told them to take the dish off my bill and to forget it. I was no longer in the mood to eat there. The manager refused. I told them that I would NOT be paying for something that had been ill prepared and that I never ate. I NEVER took a bit from the first plate or the 2nd one that FINALLY came along. I eventually was able to speak to their GM.  They had the dish removed immediately without my really having to go through the re-cap of my horrible experience. They even offered me a complimentary dessert for that night or a future night. Whatever. That didn't make it OK. I'm still NOT a happy camper!  I haven't been back since early this year, February 2017.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=60,2.36,2.68,2.684,2.372,2.552

My wife and I stopped in last night after shopping and let me tell you, the management team is weak therefore the service is weak.  1. After waiting about 45mins for a table for 2, the host walks us over to our table. Well the busier was still clearing it off, so the host says as soon as he's done you can sit then walks away. So my wife and I are standing around between other families and their tables looking foolish.  2. We were seated for about 4 to 5 minutes before our server stopped by. When he did stop by he simply slid a basket of bread onto the table and walked away. Then the host returned with menus.  3. After another 5 minutes after that the server comes back by drops off water and says I'll be back.  4. Another 3 minutes the server returned and says ""do y'all want drinks?"" (Clearly this behavior is signed off on by his management team, since he believes when dealing in customer service/ hospitality you should probably introduce yourself) So my wife orders a drink then he looks at me and says nothing but just gives a blank look. So I said ""water is fine, I'm ready to order"".  We place our order and almost 15 minutes later (I had my phone out and was timing him at this point) my wife's drink comes. He drops the drink off and never returned.  I see him taking with some girls in the bar so I flag him down like I'm directing traffic. He comes over and says ""what's up"" (I guess we're homies now). So I asked for the check, at this point we've been setting for about 40 minutes. He give my check to the manager (again didn't introduce herself).  So give a quick summary to the manager. She quickly offers free cheesecake. I declined and told her, I simply want to pay my check and leave.  As I'm waiting for my card, the server shows up with the food and looking confused. So I had to tell him ""no thank you, we're done here"".  Walked across the courtyard over to Katsuya and had a much better experience and time with my wife. I went from BBQ Pizza to Sushi.

The salad came promptly but for some reason had kernels of corn at the bottom of it. At first, I didn't know what it was and was almost feeling sick because there were dried yellow particles in it. I realized it was corn and felt slightly better but - gross. I asked the bartender about it, he said, ""wow. That shouldn't be there"" and walked away. I asked to speak to the manager who was apologetic and accommodating. He said, ""it just falls into the salads sometimes"". I asked if he'd take half off of the salad, since I'd eaten half before I saw the corn. He took my check & said he'd be back. 20 mins later I asked the bartender if he knew where my check was. He said he'd ask the manager but eventually just reprinted it, the manager had removed the salad. That was nice, and above what I requested, but to not come back and to keep me waiting so long was a bit.... crappy.

I live in the area but would make the DRIVE to the Grove location just to avoid this awful service. I ordered two identical four cheese pasta dishes to go. One of them was great, the other was plain without any cheese and the pasta was FOUR cheese pasta. How do you let an order be sent out without the main ingredient? My order came out to $35 and i got what tasted like high school cafeteria style spaghetti noodles with marinara sauce. All was fine until i called to complain and the man at the front desk told me he would connect me to a manager. I stayed on the line for 10 minutes and still no one said a word. I have to listen to their hold songs on repeat starving because i can't eat this crappy pasta because i do not want to get sick. So beyond upset.

179,Amy G.,"Glendale, CA",0,4,5.0,1.0,2017-10-04,"I live at the Americana so I speak as an expert here.  Do not EVER order takeout from this location. Honestly I'd be hesitant to go at all.  My neighbor and I both got severe food poisoning from chicken here. Mine was from takeout that had chicken - they didn't bring it out until over 15 minutes after the time quoted. It was cold. I warmed it up at home, and 12 hours later I was sleeping on the floor of my bathroom with a severe fever and not even able to keep water down. My neighbor was also sick, and it lingered enough that she was tested by her doctor two weeks later and tested positive for salmonella.  Cheesecake Factory of course denied any wrong doing, but sent us each a $20 gift card for our troubles.  Tonight I was really hungry and decided to finally give them another chance so I didn't keep carrying this gift card around. I ordered the Factory Nachos - no meat, so I was hoping it was safe.  After again making me wait an extra 15 minutes after my quoted time, my Nachos came out cold. Not even lukewarm, cold. I didn't want to take the chance again so I had them give me a refund. I went there hungry and left over half an hour later with no food and a conviction that this is the level of quality anyone can expect here.  I have been going to Cheesecake Factorys since I was a child. I always thought of them as a reliable and nice place to eat. I will never eat here again, and since I live upstairs and like the sort of food they make, that's saying a lot. Edited to add: Instead of refunding me to a new gift card, they literally fished the used gift card out of the trash and gave it back to me.

She stopped coming around, and we had to ask someone to track her down so that we could put our order in. She brought us full portions of all the lunch items that we ordered. And she asked us if we really wanted to change to lunch portions because the kitchen would have to throw the food away.

The hosts do not have a clue about what it is to accommodate their guests/clients. I asked them for assistance and all they did is brush me off. If you do not want to work in a busy restaurant then find some other occupation. No one has to deal with your unhappiness. Moving on, if you know that Saturday nights are your busiest especially at a location like the Americana...why would you only have one person manning the cash register??? Not only is he getting bombarded by unexpected questions but he also has to receive the attitude and bitchiness of annoyed guests. I feel bad for the poor man. I'm sure he's getting a pittance of wage. Lastly, I really don't understand what the point was of ordering ahead when by the time I got home...the food was as cold as dog's nose.

Had a late lunch with my family and a few hours later I felt extremely nauseous. End be all, I ended up in the hospital for food poisoning and have never felt so terrible in my life. I had one of their new Orlean style pastas and I'm not sure if it was the chicken or perhaps the sauce. Let's just say I am scarred from ever eating here.. and don't want to think about chicken or pasta.  Such a terrible experience. I never thought cheesecake to be a 5 Star, but it was always convenient. Convenience is not worth anyone's well being.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Cheesecake Factory has so many options that you will find something of your liking. Those who like to watch the calories they have a ""skinnylicious"" menu.  All plates are huge; you can share!!  For those not worried about calories my favorites off the menu are: The jambalaya pasta with chicken and shrimp. A bit spicy with some Cajun seasoning all over the pasta, grilled bell peppers and poultry and shrimp.  Avocado egg rolls! A fun, fried, oily appetizer that everyone just loves.  Ahi carpaccio. A plate filled with an extremely thin layer of ahi, with some ginger and sesame sauce. It's not heavy and you won't feel guilty.  Recently however, I ordered the herb crusted salmon along with a dark greens mix salad (no dressing; lemon wedges on side) and was appalled when 90% of the salad was old. I mean, it smelled old from the second they sat it down.  We ordered two of these, both the same. So, it wasn't just bad luck either.  The manager apologized and told us he would send a new plate however we argued it would be the same as their salad bunch had likely gone bad. He assured us there was fresh salad in the back. (Well, good sir, why did your kitchen staff not make sure that's what they plate?) they ended up giving us free cheesecake and comping my meal. Which is great, except I don't eat cheesecake and I would of much rather had a fresh salad to eat for lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2,2.4,2.66,2.672,2.244,2.556

Then my wife asked for extra sauce on the side for her Fettuccine pasta ,after another 10 minutes they brought a disgusting bowl of oil which they called sauce. We didn't want the past anymore, and instead my wife asked for a bottle of mineral water and that took another 10 minutes to bring, and when I asked what was going on. Waitress told us he had to pick it up from the bar like any other drinks that's why it took a long time to bring it.

The line at 4 PM on Saturday (admittedly, the weekend before Christmas) was tolerable at 40 minutes. If you come after that then you are screwed and be prepared to wait for upwards of 90 minutes or more. Anyway our party of four adults one kid and one toddler was seated in a seemingly large booth. However the seats felt like an airplane seating - meaning if one of us had to exit to the aisle it required a major reshuffling of people sitting in the same row. Probably because of the toddler highchair but still this felt really tight even without the highchair. The only dish worth mentioning today was the lemon chicken piccata that wifey got. It had the perfect balance of tender chicken breast, citrus zest, and just the right amount of cream without being overbearing. Meanwhile the seafood chicken jambalaya pasta was a complete hot mess and should be burned alive LOL! I mean seriously why put Jambolaya with pasta and furthermore the Jambolaya had no southern seasoning nor spice. Pass! Thank God they did not screw up the cheesecake - both the key lime cheesecake and the strawberry cheesecake were excellent - as they should be from a restaurant who's name sake is cheesecakes LOL.

My husband, family and I have been doing this for the past 8-9 years. We sit outside and have a gorgeous view of the Christmas tree and lights. They have heating lamps so it isn't too cold. The service has always been good- so they never lack there. It was extremely hard for me to find a dish that I'd actually be excited to get each time I go, versus just being excited for the view/ambiance. This past time we went (last week) I have finally found a dish that I'd order again and again. The Seared Ahi Tuna. Being a big fish eater, I was always concerned getting a fish dish from a place that serves so many different types of food and doesn't really specialize in any particular entree, but I am so glad I gave it a shot. It was seared perfectly. The veggies and rice were cooked perfectly. This place is a must go to during the Christmas season.

This review isn't about the food, it's about an item that was left at this particular restaurant. 12/17/17, has dinner here with my girlfriend. We leave the restaurant and once we're home we realize we left an item (cologne from Sephora) back at the restaurant. I immediately call once I realized it and luckily, one of the staff members set the item aside with my name and number. A day passes, I call the restaurant and tell them I'll be there in a couple days to pick it up. They assure me it fine, item is still set aside. 12/22/17 I drive to the restaurant for the item, one of the host says he can't find it, but he can take my name and number so he can speak to a manager later to locate the item...I explain to him I'm not from the area and drove an hour and a half to pick up my item and I was told it was set aside for me with my name and number attached. After beating around the bush a little, a manager finally comes and speaks to me and says it's not in the managers office and it's not in the lost and found, there's isn't anything they can do, and it's gone. I ask if he can speak to the waiter from that night and he says it wouldn't be possible to find out who was working that night....he gives a corporate number for loss prevention, which I call and goes to a voicemail. Do not leave anything at Cheesecake Factory, especially if it's a gift for a loved one...unfortunately their loss prevention is negligible and they employ thieves.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=60,2.72,2.6,2.732,,2.648

I ordered the jambalaya, which is my usual order whenever I go to any Cheesecake Factory but at this location I regret choosing it. There was barely any sauce nor flavor in the chicken.

879,Greg P.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",0,22,40.0,3.0,2017-12-27,"The food is alright and the service is very hit or miss. I've been coming here for years because it's an easy place to eat at the Americana with friends/family, since they have every type of food on the menu imaginable.  At my last visit, our server was great. Her name was Kelly B and she was very sweet, attentive, and overall one of the better servers that I have had while eating at this location.  Of all the things I have eaten at Cheesecake, I will say one item on the menu sticks out to me and I get it almost every time. That is the dressing on the Santa Fe Salad (it is a Peanut-Cilantro Vinaigrette). It is very delicious and I typically ask for that dressing on almost any salad I order. Definitely recommend that dressing.  One of the biggest problems I have had at Cheesecake Factory is when I adjust the specifications of a dish, it typically comes out wrong. I have no idea why? I find it hard to believe it's the servers putting in the wrong order every time (that would be just too coincidental). I like to think it's miscommunication either in the kitchen or with the expo/food runners. Whatever it is, I always expect my order to come out wrong if I change it up from what the menu has, so I pretty much try my best to either keep it very simple or just find an entree that doesn't need any adjustments. For example, I gave up on ordering a burger with the exact ingredients that I like. It's like the chef's take a look at my burger order and say ""well, that's cute, but I think he'll like this instead."" Nah... I just want my burger the way I asked please.  Overall, the Cheesecake Factory can be a very hit or miss place with both food and service. The upside to the restaurant is that the menu is gigantic, so it's perfect for a group of people who want different foods. It's a nearly impossible feat to find somebody that wouldn't like anything on the menu. I will probably always be dragged back here by friends/family just because the convenience of the large menu, but in reality, the Americana has so many better restaurants (in my opinion).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2,2.64,2.6,2.724,,2.616

They have an extremely large menu so there's something for everyone, but with this variety you compromise some quality. The food is consistent and good MOST of the time, but other times the quality hasn't been great, the wait does tend to be long, and it gets very loud indoors when it's busy. It's hard to give one rating when I've been here more times than I can remember with varying experiences but the Americana location is by far the closest and my most frequented location. I've had many items from their menu over the years...from appetizers: avocado egg rolls (delicious), fried mac and cheese (pretty good), tex mex eggrolls (just okay), sweet corn tamale cakes (amazing but so many calories!)... from entrees: Louisiana pasta chicken (good but heavy), pasta da vinci (decent as well), veggie burger (amazing surprisingly), Mexican tortilla salad (hit or miss but usually good)... brunch/breakfast: monte Cristo is my sister's favorite. Probably a few more I'm forgetting at the moment. The wait times can get long on the weekends. When majority of restaurants now use the texting system, I don't like how they give you a buzzer at this location so you can't walk around too far while you wait. They do validate for Americana parking. Service has always been good. Regardless of the average rating, CF is like a staple that I'll be returning to due to its a popular choice among friends and it having something for everyone.
