71,Marshall S.,"San Diego, CA",53,102,8.0,3.0,2012-01-16,"One word to describe this place: Huge. The menu is huge, the building is huge, the portions are huge. I've been to several Cheesecake Factories and they are all about the same. I usually don't like to go to chains, but it seems to be a frequent dining options for birthdays or other occasions.  It is a good place for groups since they have the space to accommodate large tables. The food is generally good, the servers are generally good, and there is something for everybody on their menu.  One food I always get is the Texas Eggrolls. Delicious, greasy, and almost a meal by themselves. I usually pass on the cheesecake since I'm full from the huge portions, but they always look delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3?start=60,2.54,2.54,2.54,2.54,2.54

67,T B.,"New York, NY",122,70,,1.0,2012-06-09,"So, last Sunday a couple of friends and family went to have brunch at this Cheesecake location in Milwaukee. We were in town for a wedding. I've been to the Cheesecake a million times in a million different cities in the country and I love the large portions, great food selections, and of course-the cheesecake. This location was by far the worst Cheesecake I've ever visited. The servers and busboys were terrible. Our particular server-Alex, was so kind, sweet, and accommodating. The hostess was rude and obnoxious. The busboys who were cleaning up the tables on the patio were dropping glasses, spilling water everywhere, laughing, and essentially spoiling a perfectly good weekend brunch.

45,Nicole H.,"Milwaukee, WI",153,468,141.0,2.0,2013-01-02,"I always feel like the hosts here make way more of a production about seating people than it needs to be.  My last visit was about 8 pm on a weekend night and most of the restaurant was empty - despite that, my part of three stood at the host desk for upwards of five minutes while they decided and figured out where to seat us. I'm aware this had to do with figuring out which sections were still open and which servers were not yet cut, but the whole thing was way more difficult than it should have been and just kind of started the whole thing off poorly. It felt like they should be way more organized than they were.   To me, Cheesecake Factory tries to be everything to everyone and therefore is not really anything to anyone, if that makes sense. The menu is giant and overambitious and tends to mean that they do a ton of dishes ok, instead of doing a few dishes spectacularly. I usually find the menu overwhelming and have a hard time deciding on anything.  In the end I had some sort of chicken pasta that was fine, though it came with arugula and the arugula was kind of EVERYWHERE. I think it was meant for garnish (I hope), but it ended up in practically every bite and just so wasn't necessary. It was a warm dish - with random fresh arugula thrown on top. It didn't meld and it didn't enhance - it was just kind of wilty and in the way.  The only memorable part of the experience was the waiting awkwardly to be seated when there were tons of empty tables, which doesn't bode well for any of the food, you know?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3?start=40,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44

30,Angie O.,"Shorewood, WI",356,412,274.0,3.0,2013-09-17,"I've been here several times, and if I had to describe the Cheesecake Factory in one word it would be: overwhelming. I have always had good service here - the wait staff has always been friendly, but sometimes it does take a while to get the check. The food I've gotten has always been good, and the portions are very large so I feel you get your money's worth. But I personally feel that their menu is too large - they literally have everything. You want burgers or steak? They have it. Fish? They have that. Italian? Yep. Chinese/Asian-fusion dishes? Got that too. Normally I would love the variety, but CF goes a little overboard. I have never come here because I am craving a particular food or dish; I come here because I'm bored. As it definitely lies in the realm between expensive and cheap/moderately priced, and I am a very busy person, I don't frequent CF often. But the times I have been here it takes me and my dining partner(s) ages to decide what we want. I mentioned previously the food here is good, but due to the ginormous menu there is a lack of stand-out items. Everything I have ever had is the standard ""pretty good."" Cheesecake Factory's ""thing"" is the cheesecake. With this, I greatly appreciate the variety!! The cheesecakes I have tried have always tasted fresh and are delicious. But the vast majority run $7.95 + tax a piece. The pieces are large, definitely enough to split with another person. When I have a few extra dollars and have had a long day of working, I do like to splurge and get a piece for myself as an ""I can't believe I got through the day"" treat. I have to address the décor. Does anyone else feel like they've stepped into a Vegas casino upon entering the Cheesecake Factory? That could just be me... but I feel like its Caesar's Place meets The Venetian, which leaves me unsure of what look they are going for. And during the dinner rush it gets very loud. Perhaps I'd venture to CF more often if they offered some sort of happy hour special. They are definitely lacking in the specials department. And if they currently offer specials then it is not advertised very well! I'd recommend CF for picky eaters, because they would definitely find multiple dishes to choose from in their book of a menu. I don't recommend CF if you are short on time... or cash.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3?start=20,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668
59,Gary H.,"Milwaukee, WI",3,109,2.0,3.0,2013-09-29,"The food today was fine, but, Oy, do they need to get their stuff together.  A couple of years ago we got into the habit of having lunch at the CF once a week. The manager was  great and the service superb. We even had regular servers stop over to say hi. A bunch of health challenges have changed our lunch planning, but we like to stop in from time to time.  The current day manager seemed to be great. You see she came to our table after I cancelled my sweet potato fries, having already waited 15 minutes for a burger. She explained that she would comp them. I replied that I was finished eating and didn't want them. She offered to give us a dessert. We thanked her and explained it wasn't necessary. Our server was very, very social. I am sure he thought that this constituted service. It doesn't. I told her that while he was a nice young person, he needed additional training. While we waited for 15 minutes, he visited many tables, kneeling at them and chatting up the customers. This might be a tip builder for some; for me it is annoying, especially when I am waiting for my food. I reiterated that we were fine and needed nothing comped. After our table was cleared, we again waited for our  bill. When it finally came, our server said he had asked the manager to comp my burger. I told him I was unhappy with that decision because it is not what I had asked. He asked if there was anything he could do differently. I said, ""yes, listen.""

They were going to charge us for both drinks even though he gave the impression that he was getting a substitute drink for the 1/4 of a drink she had earlier.  So!

There was quite a wait so we got our little buzzer and went outside to enjoy the fresh air, after about 30 mins we were seated. I had the tomato basil pasta, the portion was ginormous, well a lot more pasta than I could ever eat in one sitting. The chicken on the pasta was a little dry and lacking in any flavor but the pasta noodles were perfect and the combination of the basil and tomato was delicious. The mister had some steak and chicken combo plate with mashed potatoes. The potatoes were my favorite part of his dish, super buttery!! The steak and chicken were smothered in some mushroom sauce which I thought was just a way to cover up the lack of flavor from the meat. But even with all their food options the Cheesecake Factory is supposed to be better known for the cheesecake right? Sadly we were too full to order more than one slice which was the 30th anniversary cheesecake with chocolate cake, it was delicious with fresh whipped cream, and it was a ginormous slice, but I don't know if I'd regularly want to pay $8 for a slice of cheesecake, good thing we got it for half that price, and it was date night. Our waiter was nice but very busy, and only came back a few times to hurriedly ask us if we needed anything, which is fine since it was so busy.

Try the Godiva chocolate cheesecake- we took a slice home and it didn't even last the rest of the night it was so savory. Only minor critiques would be with service quality. The menu is quite extensive and takes a bit to sift through (even if you've been there before like I had) and I felt as though our server was a bit pushy trying to get us to order. Also, my water was only refilled once the entire visit (and I had to ask for it). It wasn't too much of a problem though because I was enjoying a delicious strawberry lemonade (also recommendable).

My server (IGNACIO, P) was not focused. When we ordered our drinks my son ordered root beer and he brought him milk, which he was able to fix upon request. When I placed my order I specifically asked to have the avocado remove (as I am allergic) after 45 minutes our food arrived. The first taco I did not see the avocado as it was at the bottom of the taco. Our server had not returned so I went to the greeter and asked him to get our waiter. The manager was present and prompt and very supportive. I guess what I am really thrown back by is when I paid for my meal, my bill was 22.07, I gave the waiter 40.07 and he gave me $8 back. I then informed the waiter that I had given him 40.07 and he laughed and said oh I'm sorry and gave me $10 with me telling him the amount. This was very suspicious and the straw that broke the camels back. I was satisfied with speaking to the manager and even more pleased that the greeter was nice enough to give me a soda to settle my stomach. I just thought it should be public information that this waiter really needs training on people skills as well as communication, courtesy. Really disappointed.

My husband and I shared the dynamite shrimp, which were absolutely amazing, and for our main meals, I had the Southwest Chicken sandwich, while my husband opted for the Spicy Crispy Chicken sandwich. My meal was delicious, but the bread was over-toasted, so it was fairly difficult to bite into. My husband enjoyed his meal, as well, except ""spicy"" is the last thing we would call the crispy chicken sandwich. Perhaps we just like our ""spicy"" to equal three alarm fire for our tastebuds.

We recently went to the one at bayshore and we will not be coming back. The fact that the menu is 10 or so pages long shows that the meals won't be anything special. We started off with the tex mex eggrolls which were actually better then the entree itself. We then split a full size pasta dish, which was nothing special and could easily whip this up at home, which says something because I suck at cooking. The cheesecake did make this trip worth it, the mango slice was very good. So the food was disappointing and to top this off - our server was HORRIBLE. She had trouble with any serving tasks. She asked us multiple times in a short amount of time if we were ready to order, we can't look through a 10 page menu in 3 minutes. She only told us the specials after we asked. We had to ask for our water to filled 3-4 times. She also brought our entrees out when we weren't even half way done with our appetizer. We also noticed she completely screwed up the tables order next to us. The hostess was more pleasant to us then she was. Bad food and incompetent servers.

She offered complementary bread, and every few minutes she popped over with ""bread is just coming out of the oven, should be right out"" which made me laugh. I mean, how many times can bread come out of the oven?! We ended up getting the bread pretty much with the food, half of which was stale/hard (the other seemed warm and fresh).  The menu is absolutely atrocious - 20+ pages, half of which is advertisements of businesses in other states (which makes me wonder if business is not going well?), and is organized all kinds of backwards. It's not an easy menu to navigate because things are spread out all over the place with full page ads in between.  The food itself was good and the Sangria my date had was actually very good. Prices were a little high for what you are getting but I don't think it's unreasonable. I think Cheesecake Factory has done a nice job of meeting (not exceeding) expectations as a big box store.

The ceilings are high and the decor is pretty, giving you something to look at while you wait for your food. Like all Cheesecake Factories, your meal starts with a basket of bread. The honey wheat bread is always delicious, and is one of the best things about The Cheesecake Factory.  We started with an appetizer of stuffed mushrooms, which were stuffed with Fontina, Parmesan, garlic, and herbs and served in a wine sauce. They were delicious, and we kept dipping our bread in the sauce. We'd definitely order them again. My mother in law ordered the Chicken and Biscuits, which is chicken smothered in gravy and served with mashed potatoes, biscuits, and veggies. While it's not the best thing she's ever ordered here, she liked it well enough. My girlfriend ordered a factory combination with both Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon, which came with mashed potatoes. She love, love, loved it. I ordered my usual Chicken Madeira, which is chicken covered in a sweet Madeira sauce and topped with cheese, mushrooms, and asparagus. It comes with mashed potatoes as well. It's always delicious, and the sauce is amazing. Why order something else when this is perfect? And of course, we had to get dessert. My mother in law got the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake, which is stacked layers of chocolate cake, cheesecake, and truffle cream. She loved it. It was so rich, she could only eat about half. My girlfriend ordered the Toasted Marshmallow S'Mores Galore cheesecake, and she loved hers too. It's Hershey's chocolate cheesecake topped with ganache, graham cracker pieces, and melty marshmallow. There was lots of marshmallow goo, which made her happy. I had the Lemon Meringue Cheesecake, and it was really good. It's lemon cream cheesecake with lemon mousse and meringue, as well as candied zest on top.

I would say that it's been nearly a year since I have last eaten here, and I was really looking forward to their green salad with their delicious blue cheese dressing that has, in the past, automatically come on the side, no request necessary. The salad had become one of my favorites because of the variety of fresh and flavorful greens, a wonderful combination of textures, flavors, and colors, just about exactly as seen here: what I got was a garnished up bowl of what might have been this: pre-dressed, just slathered with what, I will give you, is one of the best ever salad dressings. But slathered. Not on the side, as it had been every other of the dozen plus times I had ordered it. Had it not been for my love of the dressing, I might have quit after the first bite, but I admit, I had been so looking forward to that dressing that I soldiered on, until, a third of the way through, I realized I was not even enjoying the dressing. The server, Ricky, was wonderful, and when I explained my twofold disappointment to him, he was very solicitous and concerned. I ordered a piece of cheesecake to go, and when the check came, there was no charge for the cheesecake.

Not a hint of pink to be found, at all.  The server decides that this is the perfect time to transport to an alternate dimension, fall in love, have children, grow old, & then come back to this dimension & check on us. I tell her about the burger & how I can't eat it since it is wildly overcooked.  She asks if I want a replacement. I say no because I had filled up on the bread & fries and since there was the long wait until she came back, my body got the memo that it was full. So she brings out the receipt and my burger is still on it. I ask her to remove the burger that I couldn't eat & that she took away & just charge me for the fries.  I have never seen someone look so lost and confused before.  Ten minutes pass. A manager comes over & starts talking about the burger. Saying it is a delightfully tasty entrée & that he is sorry it was mixed up. I said I was sorry as well but we would really like the check now please.  He comes back with another burger and tries to give it to me.  I explained, again, that I didn't want the burger. I was full & it was unnecessary & it wasn't even the right burger.  Fifteen minutes later, we finally get the updated check. They did comp my entire entrée & fries but that was not the issue.  I would have happily paid for the fries because I ate the fries. I left my tip and moved on with my life.  This location is pretty but a bit cramped since it is in the mall.  Nice server who still was tipped heavily because she didn't do anything wrong.  Maybe speed service up a bit? Nobody likes to wait thirty minutes for a check.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002

My food came out cold, and his pasta was all clumped together except for maybe 1/3 of it. Afterward we got cheesecake, and we didn't get silverware with it. For the price of dinner, the quality should be much better. This is the 3rd time we've had to sadly make a complaint about something from here. As always though, the cheesecake was great, but unfortunately we will not be back in the near future for food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3?start=20,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007

3,Marian Q.,"Milwaukee, WI",143,121,149.0,4.0,2017-01-29,"As a broke college student, the Cheesecake Factory was my idea of fine dining. And as far as this location is concerned, I've never had a service issue and I've eaten in and carried out from here quite a few times.  Over the years, i have expanded my horizons but I occasionally find myself making my way back to the Cheesecake Factory because with their expansive menu there's always something for everyone. The way I have conquered their huge menu is to find one or two things that I like and I know are consistently good and stick with them. I have made the mistake of trying new things and have been mildly disappointed. Go for the chicken bellagio, the Jamaican black pepper chicken or a burger and you will not be disappointed.  Great place to go for groups- but make a reservation if you're going in over the weekend because it definitely gets filled with shoppers but the wait is a good time to do some shopping!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004
35,Sue V.,"Milwaukee, WI",4,3,,1.0,2017-02-04,"I don't care how good the food can be. If the service is not good, then the whole experience and food goes down the drain. My compliant is about the hostess. She did not do a good job. We waited more than 1 hour and 30 minutes, as quoted. But somehow 2 seaters and 4 seaters are sitting before our large group. Granted we do have a group of 13 but that doesn't mean we should wait longer than quoted. And an excuse that ""we are waiting for customer to get up from their seat, sorry."" You can simply grab a table from a different section and add it. But instead you choose to wait for a table from that particular section to get up! Is it the users experience that matters the most or you convenience of setting tables up more important?! Just doesn't make sense to me. I'm humiliated and embarrassed that 3 ppl from our group had to leave bc the wait was dragging on too long! Either hire a new hostess with more experience or who has more intuition or give better training! It doesn't take a lot to recognize that a customer isn't happy, especially when they ask more than once when they can be seated! I know I can do a better job. It's common sense and doesn't take a masters degree to figure out what you should do to accommodate all your customers especially when your rely on customers to stay in business!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3?start=20,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002

I met a friend for a late dinner and the restaurant was nearly empty. We ordered water and 2 orders of lettuce wraps. After 40 minutes waiting for our food, our server (Trey) assured us it would be right up. Another 20 minutes passed with no sign of trey, a manager, or our food. I felt he was avoiding our table. When the food (lettuce wraps) finally did arrive more than an hour after we ordered, both Trey and the manager on the floor (Brittany) insisted it was delayed due to lettuce leaves not being prepared. I don't buy it. The manager never offered to compensate even a portion of our bill.  The food was ultimately tasty.

1,Meghna S P.,"Milwaukee, WI",14,73,47.0,4.0,2017-11-07,"I have visited several Cheesecake Factories but this one stands out to me. They always have good staff and is very conveniently located in the Bayshore Mall. Typically during rush hour there will be a wait (more on the weekends) but otherwise they seat you almost immediately.  Their bar has amazing drinks and I really like that they have a skinny menu for the health conscious ones. Their food choices are in abundance.. you can get overwhelmed because you would want to eat everything! I like how they break down their menu into seafood, or specialities and pastas and so on. I love their herb crusted Salmon and a few pastas. The new Thai coconut chicken is amazing! A must try.. it's a very flavorful entree. My husband often enjoys a pineapple or blueberry Mojito which they make really well!  Coming to the cheesecakes... isn't that the best part ? Assorted endlessly, their cheesecakes are one of the best. My favorite one is a caramel one called dulce and its to die for! So good! My mum loves the red velvet here and recently I saw a few new ones, amongst which mango key lime stood out to me.. mango and lime.. what not to like?  Unless you are allergic to a flavor, I highly recommend experimenting with your tastebuds here.

We've been to this location on a couple occasions now and have been pleased each time.  If you have a cheesecake lover in the family, this is your spot. Their cheesecake menu is vast and varied. In addition, their slices are ample (like whoa). So ample, in fact, that my main dining companion and I almost always share a piece (if we can agree on a flavor). When we don't share, we almost assuredly have some left over to bring home.  Their cocktail game is strong. My current favorite on their signature cocktail menu is their bourbon & honey. It's lightly sweet and made with Four Roses Bourbon, orange blossom honey, and finished with a sprig of thyme. If you've never had bourbon paired with thyme, let me be the first to tell you--they make an excellent combination.  We tend to sit in the bar area and have been more than pleased with the service we've received (kind, accommodating, and just plain friendly). We've always found the servers to be helpful and ready with recommendations when called upon.
