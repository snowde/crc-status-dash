7,Elizabeth T.,"Greenville, United States",107,77,312.0,1.0,2016-03-06,"VERY disappointed with the service I received. I called 10 minutes in advance to get an idea of how long we were going to wait. I knew it would be long because they just opened. They stated it would be 30 minutes. I repeated it back to be sure and ended the call as I was pulling up in the parking lot. I walked through the door and was printed out a ticket for 2-2 1/2 hour wait. I advised of the conversation I just had, and they advised that that's just how it was. I took my ticket, grabbed a quick app with a friend to hold us over since we skipped out on lunch, and proceeded to walk the mall to kill time. After 2 1/2 hours, I still received no call to inform a table for 4 was ready...at this point it was 9:45 pm on a Thursday...I gave one star for the ticketing system that I found useful. That's it. Looks like I'll be going to the Cheesecake Factory in Atlanta instead to be sure that I'll receive good food and service.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenville?start=100,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308

The food was very tasty but made me sick. I had soup and salad. Our main complaint was that the music was so loud one had to shout to be heard. We could not wait to finish.

We were seated and ordered an appetizer which came right out. We then placed our order for food which consisted of spaghetti, herb crusted parmesean chicken and chicken madiera. It took about 45 minutes before we received our food. The waitress kept apologizing but the food still wasn't coming. After 45 minutes the food finally came and i waited another 15 minutes for a side of broccoli that was ordered the same time as my meal. We asked for a manager. A woman (can't remember her name) came to the table admitted that the normal wait time to receive your food should be able 20 minutes. When we ecplained that we had waited 45 minutes, she did a bunch of apologizing, wished us well and walked off.

Given the circumstances (about 150 people waiting to be seated or eating) we got our food rather quickly. My husband had the Louisiana chicken pasta and I had the Chicken and Biscuits. Both entrees were delicious! My only complaint-- we had multiple servers approach us and tell us they were our servers, and when asked if we wanted to go drinks, we never received them and were left very thirsty eating our Oreo cheesecake together!

Today was the grand opening and the joint was a mad house of people. I knew there was no way of getting dinner but I couldn't help myself I had to get a slice of cheesecake so I thought it would be a quick drop in by the display case and get a slice to go but to my surprise i had to wait thirty minutes just to get a slice of cake...I wasn't the only one who couldnt help themselves! I got the tiramisu, lemon meringue, and key lime cheesecake and they were well worth the wait! And not to mention I loved the decor inside...very elegant! Update, I had lunch there today with four family members. The whole experience took 4 hrs. Checked in at 1:20 & didnt leave till 5. took an hour to be seated which was expected being that the place is new. It took 10 mins before we were waited on, 10 mins to get the coffee we ordered which was luke warm. Another 10 mins before we got the fried zucchini for appetizer. It was ok, cut a little too thick for my liking but batter was tasty. Another 15-20 min before we got to order entrées. I got the buffalo blasts Chicken, Cheese and Our Spicy Buffalo Sauce all Stuffed in a Spiced Wrapper and Fried until Crisp. Served with Celery Sticks and Blue Cheese Dressing. It sounds better than i thought they actually tasted. Daughter got macaroni cheese burger  Charbroiled and Topped with our Creamy Fried Macaroni and Cheese Balls and Cheddar Cheese Sauce. Served with Lettuce, Tomato, pickless, Onion and Mayo. It was pretty good but it was a very thick burger which I dont like. Sister had chicken marsalla Chicken Breast Sauteed with Fresh Mushrooms in a Rich Marsala Wine Sauce. Served over Bow-Tie Pasta...it was ok not bad but Ive had better. Mom had filet mignon served with salad and mash potatoes. She enjoyed it and said the cake was seaoned and cooked perfectly Aunt had FRIED SHRIMP PLATTER Lightly Breaded and Fried Crisp with French Fries and Cole Slaw. She enjoyed it. We each got a cheesecake: salted carmel, snickers, white choc macadamia, choc moose, and a low carb. All were delicious! 1 star fir great decor 1 star for clean bathrooms, one star for friendliness, 1 star for great cheesecake. I will be back to try other dishes, but the food we had today just didnt do it for me to give it 5 stars",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenville?start=60,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416
41,Anson P.,"Greenville, United States",0,855,3.0,2.0,2016-06-06,"Every Cheesecake Factory that I have ever been to has had at least an hour wait.  However, this one has been the longest wait.  On a Sunday night, the wait was 2 hours.  The quote was 1.5-2 hours.  Even the line to order to go which included just cheesecake orders was 30-40 minutes.  Service was slow as well.   At least the food was good.  The pasta da vinci, the pepper chicken, and the bbq chicken salad were all good and the salad portions were huge (Cheesecake factory style).  The pasta serving was not on par with what I expect from Cheesecake Factory.  I finished it and was still hungry.  This should not happen when I eat here.  We also got drinks.  11.50 for a Long Island Iced Tea.  After two of them, I didn't feel any different.  That's either a testament to my alcoholism or the drinks weren't very strong.  The latter is probably more true.  My group decided to get some cheesecake to go, and it took 20 minutes.  Come on.  The whole experience from arrival time to leaving was 4 hours.  The only consolation was that there was great people watching. From what I have heard, lunch can be just as crazy.  What I would recommend is go when the mall is still open (note that the mall closes at 6 on Sundays) and then put your name down.  Then go hang out at the mall.  Then come back.  Or...just go to Charlotte or Atlanta.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenville?start=60,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248
78,Eric B.,"Anderson, United States",0,2,,1.0,2016-06-08,Had multiple bad experiences.   First similar situation as other review.  Called to check and see how long wait was and we were 5 minutes away.   We're told 30 minutes wait and I dropped my wife off at the door to check in and she was told 1 hour and 45 minutes.   Next experience was pick up order and waited 1 hour when told it would be ready in 30 minutes.  We got back to the house 20 minutes later to find the kids meal and cheesecake was not in our to go order and we had already paid.    Called and spoke to manager and she said refunds have to be mailed from corporate and we were issued a Cheesecake Factory card for $20 which may have been a couple dollars more than the items left out.   Kids were upset and without food and we have a gift card instead of refund which would rather had given the bad experiences.   The second curbside they left off all the sauce from our lettuce wraps which is the reason we ordered and had asked for extra.    Poorly run and managed store without changes over past 3 months.   I hesitated to write this review but feel that is necessary due to them having plenty of time to work out the kinks of the new store opening.

101,Alexandra G.,"Greenville, United States",5,70,19.0,2.0,2016-06-10,"I've been to many Cheesecake Factory's in my life and this is by far the worst. Where I used to live there were 3 near me and each of them were great. For some reason the Greenville location is not the same. The reason I gave 2 stars and not 1 is because they do have great drinks and cheesecake. The Georgia Peach is my favorite drink even though it is pricey at $11.50, I think it's worth it. Nothing that was ordered at my table was very good, it tasted like it was frozen and reheated. The service was slow and spotty. It took multiple reminders to get water refills, boxes, and the check. Even though the entrees were not good, I got cheesecake to go because it will taste the same at any CF you go to because the cheesecake is not made on site. I was surprised to see this Cheesecake Factory only had a 2.5 star rating, but after being there I understand.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenville?start=80,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.4080000000000004
71,Oliver M. L.,"Fountain Inn, United States",0,25,,3.0,2016-06-15,"Haven't actually tried it. Although our party did try to get seated, we just lost our patients. The wait wasn't worth it. We went there on June 11 2016 which was a Saturday a little before 4pm.  Our wait time was estimated to be 2 1/2 hours. They did not have enough buzzer, so we gave them our Cell number to buzz us instead. The hostess told us if we did not show back within 5 minutes once they buzz us. We will loose our seating as this was a very busy night. There were Apx. 80 groups ahead of us. So we were in the mall just to kill time. When 6 O'clock came by. We we went back to check. The hostess said that there will be at least another hour wait as there were still 30 groups ahead of us. By 7pm, we were hungry and couldn't wait anymore, and if we did wait we probably would have to wait another hour just to get our food. So we left to Applebees next door which we were greeted and seat ASAP. It wasn't until almost 8:30pm that they finally gave us a call to tell us a table is ready. By then, we were already done with our food and heading home already.  I tried CCF at other locations, and as good as there food goes. It isn't worth the wait to wait around for 5 hours. Compare this CCF to other locations, this one is small. Knowing that it would always stay jam packed.

Everything was just OK. Nothing was good. We ordered pizza, pasta and two specialty chicken dishes. We won't waste our time or money again. There are much better restaurants for less in Greenville! The cheesecake was good, but that took an additional 45+ minutes to get after we ordered it and paid our check. They need to focus on fewer items on their menu and make them taste good.

It was at least 20 minutes before I got a new plate, and she brought it back still with poached egg on top. The entire plate of food was tasteless. The chicken was bland and all I tasted was breading, the waffle was not fluffy and the home fries...the best way I can describe it is little square pieces of grease.

Well first of all we were told there was a 30 minute wait . That is very doable . It was also very accurate , we were seated in 29 minutes . We took time to look at the beauty of the place . It really is pretty although kinda small . I was surprised they wasted so much spaced for outside seating . When it's 93 degrees no one is going to sit outside . We did pick out our favorite cheesecakes . I had been waiting on the Key lime and my friend wanted Banana Cream. We were seated and ordered appetizers . We had a mozzarella tomato toast and spinach dip .    The toast was amazing , the dip was awful . The waiter never cared we only took one bite . We then moved on to Cheese Cake and Coffee . We ordered only to find out they sold out of my key lime on a Friday at 3:00 pm . I was not happy . I got the raspberry lemon and it was not good .  So $28 for a ok meal .  It certainly did not measure up to Charlotte or Atlanta .  Pretty Sad .  Will go back and try to get my key lime but will pass on the food .  Update :  Went in tonite for just Cheesecake and coffee for 3 and to get Cheesecake to carry home . We were told a 10 minute wait , no problem . We were seated quickly so that was positive . The waitress did not hide the fact she wasn't happy we were dessert only people . We ordered , my friend wanted the pumpkin cheesecake and was told very sharply that , that wasn't a option because they were out . She ordered another flavor , I got key lime and my daughter got Red Velvet . Two of us asked for no whip cream . We were served quickly . All three had whip cream !  Why ?  The waitress was not listening , she wanted to turn tables . We never got a refill of coffee but my daughter was given a ""to go"" cup with out to go order .  So if you just want Cheesecake please take it home as they are not interested in serving you !

Tried to get in last Saturday, it was packed, with lots of people waiting, decided to try again mid week. Went for late lunch and had very short wait. Wow, quite an extensive menu! In the end I went for the chicken salad, which came with fries, my husband decided on the California Cheesesteak, which also came with fries. Both were very good. For the size of the Cheesesteak sandwich we felt price was a little much ($13.95). Might consider serving on smaller plate to make portion seem larger? Also would suggest adding something to the plates for presentation sake (pickle?) All in all, for lunch, to us, it's rather expensive, $42 and change including $7 tip. That also included a slice of their original cheesecake.Our waitress was super attentive and very personable. Oh, our waitress also brought us bread with our meals, tho' didn't see the need since we had sandwiches, but the bread was hard as a rock, waitress said ""yeah, it's ciabatta bread"".....

He said well sorry you should've been in the other line and walked off. So bottom line is we got the shaft. We went to papas n beer. I will never return to this Cheesecake Factory ever again!! If you advertise an entrance then that's what it should be. Why don't you have a sign stating otherwise if it's not a blank entrance. We got the shaft!!

From the initial greet by the smiling bartender Shirley to the desert everything was absolutely amazing. We were greeted almost immediately and decided to try  couple of the specialty cocktails on her sughestion.  I took her suggestion on the Mai Tai and my wife did the same on the Strawberry Martini amd they were some of the best freshly made cocktails we have had amywhere.  She took her time to make them perfext for us, but still managed to serve us quickly all while handling a chaotic bar. When it came time to order entrees I took another one of suggestions on the Pasta Da Vinci and my wife had the Filet Mignon.  The Pasta Da Vinci is now my favorite pasta dish anywhere in Greenville and her filet was one of the most tender cuts she has ever had. Next up was desert! She suggested the Salted Caramel Cheesecake and one of her favorites the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake and we were not dissapointed.  Both were amazing and probably the best cheesecake we both have ever had. The whole experience was perfect and what made it so wonderful was the expierence at the bar.  We almost always dine at a table when we go out to eat, but whenever we visit The Cheesecake Factory we will definitely only dine at the bar.  Thanks for the amazing night out!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenville?start=120,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.612,2.52

The reviewer who said that the Chicken and Waffles are disgusting clearly can't read because its Benedict and comes with Hollandaise!  We tried it on our last visit and its wonderful! Horrible prices is another lie. It's clearly on the level of other restaurants in Greenville. Going to anything else in the same range will cost you the same.  Service is a bit slow because the servers have a lot of tables and it seems like entering a order takes a few minutes. That is something that needs to be fixed, there's too many servers waiting to enter orders in not enough computers. That's not your server's fault and you shouldn't lie or tip down because of it.

0,Justin D.,"Lyman, United States",27,47,147.0,1.0,2016-09-20,"Let's see, where do I begin? I'll cut straight to the chase. The menu is absolutely too large, too versatile and many items should simply not be on there. I think if they hired a real chef to sample everything on the menu and subtract the garbage then they would definitely go up a couple of stars. The margherita pizza was child's size and too much cheese, no signs of tomatoes except what was puréed into the sauce and bland. I felt like I was mostly just eating crust. It was that bad. However other menu items were nice, namely one of the appetizers which wasn't order by me but I sampled it. It was a Cajun style crab dip with toasted bread. Quite nice. Chunks of crab meat you can see is always a plus. The cheesecake was alright (once again same scenario, I merely sampled it) but was covered up in way too much extra sauce and mountains of whipped cream instead of letting the cheesecake itself be the star of the show. Overall there are too many other restaurants that are better in the area, which was a disappointment because upon entering you feel set for an excellent dinner or lunch judging by the atmosphere alone. One they weed out all of the rubbish on the menu, I would be happy to give it another go. The spinach dip tastes like spinach from a can and bland. Not worth it, especially considering how overpriced everything was which is always fine in my book, but you'd better deliver the flavor.

When our food came, my salad wasn't even the salad I wanted, my aunts side salad had balsamic dressing in it- with her ranch she asked for on the side (??). My moms eggs were cold, no extra plate for the two people sharing... then when I asked for the salad I ordered he argued with me about what I ordered.  He was gracious enough to take it away, and off my bill- but no dinner for me.   The cheesecake- while delicious, took forever to get to the table.  My 5 yr old niece was told they were out of ice cream when she asked for ice cream.  No forks came with the cheesecake, so we had to wait even longer for him to come back with those.  I guess my feedback is- if you're not going to bother writing your customers orders down for your overpriced food- then you better get the orders right.  Oh- the restrooms were horrendous.  No toilet paper in the stall I used- just empty rolls with 2 additional rolls SITTING ON THE BACK OF THE TOILET. Gross.  Just laziness!! One of the other stalls was the same.  Come on people- if you're charging $18 for a salad that isn't even the right salad- put some toilet paper on the roll.  Even though this is SC- we do not like our TP just hanging out sitting on the toilet.  Just gross.  Also- you should put a sign at the mall entrance saying something like ""Exit Only"" or please come ALL THE WAY to the hostess station.  People would continuously walk in there and just stand there like ""what do we do?

105,Noel L.,"Piedmont, United States",2,12,,1.0,2016-11-08,"My wife and I had intended to eat here today.  We decided to eat elsewhere when we were unable to call ahead or make a reservation and saw the crowd in front of the restaurant.  At a minimum there was a 2 hour wait. We did call and confirm this.  So, after dinner elsewhere we decided to make this our desert, even if we got it to go.   We called in and were hung up on twice, the third time were placed on hold for a long time but an order was finally placed.  During that call we were recommended to use curb side pick up.  We agreed to curbside and explained that we were already outside.  The wait time was expressed as 35 minutes.  Now, mind you that this was for 2 pieces of cheesecake.   During my hour long wait (that was supposed to be 35 minutes) the mall security guard tried to run me off as the curbside spaces were completely full and cars were beginning to line up on the cub beside these spaces out of the way.  Multiple times I observed people pulling up and walking in and leaving with their food, yet we waited.   At the hour mark we called to check an eta...   At that time we were told that there was at least 20 more tickets ahead of us and that it takes how long it takes.   I parked and walked in.  I was able to locate a manager who had a less than considerate tone when I explained my circumstances.  His only question was in a smart tone ""what do you want?"" ...   I responded, and at this point pissed doesn't begin to express my personal state ""I want you to sell me the food we ordered or you can tell me that it's unavailable, but either way, I'm leaving"". Suddenly, they had just walked the food outside, then he told me that it had gone out a couple times.  Now, the young lady delivering the food outside had walked out a few times while I was there.  She had to walk past us to get to other cars.  She never returned inside with food that she couldn't deliver.   So, I give one star as a gift.  The incompetence in keeping stated time lines on food that doesn't have to be cooked, merely cut, boxed, and walked outside is bad.  The personality and attitude of the small framed guy that introduced himself to me as the restaurant manager is the reason I'll not return.   ____________________________________________________________ In response to the invitation from the Cheesecake Factory to go to their contact page and follow a link so that they may speak with me...   So, my review above outlines how you originally wasted my wife's and my time by operating what the other reviews outline as a poorly run restaurant.  Your response to my review was to invite me to your website to fill out a form to state the same thing I stated here.  Yet another waste of time.  You really don't get it, customer service that is.  Here is what I expect from a restaurant.  Honesty, I.e. Give me a basic understanding of how long I have to wait, I'll decide on my own if you and I will continue our relationship from that point.  Be courteous and thankful, I.e. If I decide to continue our relationship you should be polite/ courteous as well as thankful that of all the ways available for me to spend my money that I've chosen you as a recipient.  Be neat and tidy, I don't expect a restaurant to ever be disheveled looking...  Speaks to pride in yourself, if you don't care enough to keep it neat, well then neither will anyone else.  Pride in your work, simple really, serve a meal that you would be proud to receive.  Priced accordingly, I don't expect to pay filet mignon prices for hamburger...   But I also expect to pay for what I get.   If your service staff are doing their job correctly and your kitchen staff are as well...   It shouldn't take all afternoon to complete a meal.  This means your wait times are reduced.   If you truly want to speak to me about my experience, and why I'm not coming back to your Greenville location...   Give me a phone number, I will call it.  The canned answer on Yelp, doesn't get it done.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenville?start=80,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.116,2.72

And then ordered a Filet cooked medium well to share along with an appetizer and drinks. After waiting 35 mins we were delivered a steak that had too much fat for a Filet but even worse, it was still bleeding and had blood on the plate even though we ordered medium well. There was no steak knife for us to cut with and no extra plate to share on. We politely asked the waitress if we could get it cooked just a bit more  (we weren't even really upset at this point) and she was nice and said absolutely, we want to get it right. While we were waiting again,  1 of the ""managers"" came out and proceeded to tell us rather rudely and confrontationally that the steak we sent back was ""cooked perfectly medium well"" and ""if we didn't want any pink we should ask for it to be well done."" We told him we'd been multiple times before and never had an issue with medium well having blood on the plate. He walked away without saying anything else, much less apologizing. When the waitress came back, my husband asked to speak to the same manager as the more we thought about it  the more unprofessional it became to come confront and argue with us about how we wanted our $30 steak cooked when we were very polite in our request. Another manager came out and said that guy was ""unavailable"" and he couldn't understand why he'd say something like that. We decided we didn't want to spend $30 on that steak and whatever else was done to it while in the back and instead of offering to comp our meal he said he'd give us 1 piece of cheesecake to go. Great, thanks! We will be saving our time and money from this establishment from now on!! We typically spend $150 when we take our family of 6 there but not anymore!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenville?start=120,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.244,2.64

Having to stand awkwardly behind the host stand while waiting for someone to seat us was slightly uncomfortable but what really bothered me most was my waitress not writing down our orders and having to return to the table to confirm multiple times what we were having. not surprising the girl did not get my order right the 1st but did come to double check it before sending in my correct order. we were sitting on the patio and the gentlemen were smoking very close by and while several servers made eye contact with the gentlemen no one seemed to concered with our discomfort as the whole patio stunk like smoke within minutes.    the food is AMAZING but the service has left something to be desired at least for me.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenville?start=40,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.576,2.72

My only problem is the blatant lie they tell you for the wait time. I've been there three times and each time they have lied to me and printed off a ticket with a forty minute wait time. Forty minutes ALWAYS turns into two hours.  The third time we went was a disaster where we waited THREE hours for our table (when promised a forty minute wait time of course)! When I felt like I was going to pass out from being so hungry, I approached a hostess and asked her for an estimate on how much longer it would be. She asked me how long I'd been waiting and when I told her three hours she laughed at me (to this day, I can't tell if she was being sarcastic or not). In shock, I just pointed to the ticket because along with your wait time it tells you what time you orginally arrived.  She was stunned and quickly gave us a random empty table. I'm unsure as to why we couldn't have gotten that table earlier or why it was empty, but I have no idea how they run their restaurant.  I get insanely irritated when they print off a ticket with a forty minute wait time when they know just as well as I do that they're not going to seat me  anywhere close to forty minutes time.

130,Daniel A.,"Greenville, United States",4,1,,1.0,2016-12-23,"I've had a Yelp account for a while, but haven't felt the need to review anything until now. I was with a group of seven people on Wednesday, December 21st. We expected a wait (with it being Christmas week and the restaurant being attached to a shopping mall) and honestly the wait for seating didn't take as long as we expected. We arrived at the restaurant at 5:30pm and were seated by 6pm. It took at least twenty minutes to receive all of our drinks and we didn't actually have an opportunity to place our orders until roughly 6:30pm. None of us ordered anything special. We stuck strictly to the menu and ordered only sandwiches and burgers. It took until 7:30pm to get any of our food and we didn't get all of our food. Our entire party received their food ten minutes before my wife and I did (no apologies, the wait staff acted like there wasn't anything wrong at all) and both of our burgers were burnt to a crisp and had almost no flavor, but the waitress never returned until it was time to pay at 8:30pm.  So, if you're keeping tabs on what happened, we spent three hours at this restaurant, had horrid service, and the food was mediocre. I'm fine with waiting for good food, but for the price of this restaurant and the lack of service and quality, I was appalled. Also, don't expect to be able to hold a conversation, the music is entirely too loud. I did not try their namesake cheesecake (far too expensive; why would I want to pay $7-8 for one slice of cheesecake?), but judging by the rest of the food, I can't expect anything good from trying it. Also, be aware that they don't take reservations (even for larger parties). Very disappointed.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenville?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.116,2.44

I couldn't believe this. I have worked in customer service for over 10 years and have NEVER heard of a manager questioning the customer. Considering how much our order was for, why would we lie about an $8 piece of cheesecake? If he would have just offered to refund the one piece of cheesecake, that would have been the end of the conversation, but he decided to try to blame his employees as to why he asked for the picture when he should have further explained himself instead of insinuating that we were not being truthful at first. He then proceeded to ask for my telephone number and asked why, he said "" I was going to investigate and call you back with the results."".....um, what needs to be investigated, with what results? I have never heard of something like this. I refused to have him call back and he continued to not answer my questions, pausing. This is NOT okay, and we will NOT be returning to this location.

For what we paid for 3 meals, I expect hot fresh food, not just the meat. And if it is supposed to have sauce ON the vegetables, put it ON them, NOT under them to speed things up when plating the food. We asked to speak to the manager but we're told he was not available.

When we arrived at 6:15, we were told the wait would be 60-80 minutes, so we settled in and waited, knowing that most places in Greenville would have a long wait on a Friday night. Almost 120 minutes later, we still hadn't been seated and had been told ""five more minutes"" three times by the hostess. We initially checked in with her at 75 minutes (since we had seen multiple parties who arrived after us seated) and were told that since we had been given the estimate of up to 80 minutes, we wouldn't be seated a minute before that. Because one of my friends is very pregnant and was feeling dizzy, my husband went and got her a drink from the bar. The top of the glass was broken and sharp-thankfully we caught it or it could have caused a bad cut. After our buzzer finally went off, we assumed we would be seated. Instead, we were ushered to another, different waiting area where we proceeded to wait another 10 minutes. It was ridiculous, seeing that we had eyes on our table, which was empty and wasn't bussed for about 15 minutes. When we were finally seated, my friend asked the waiter if we could receive an appetizer because of our extra unexpected wait. The waiter proceeded to tell us in a snarky, sarcastic tone that he was ""sorry for the wait, but we could have always turned around and gone somewhere else."" It was absolutely unbelievable. And not surprisingly, the waiter came back and told us the manager said no to the appetizer. When we got our drinks and bread, my friend's coffee had spilled all over the tray and soaked the bread. Instead of getting us new bread, the waiter asked us if it was so bad that we really needed new bread. And spoiler alert: the cheesecake is great, but the food is good at best. Nothing to write home about, and definitely not worth a 2 hour wait. We won't go back.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenville?start=100,2.6,2.6,2.6,1.8600000000000003,2.6

The green beans had zero seasonings on them. Mashed potatoes were bland. One big $30 rip off. I went by chik-fil-a on the way home so I could have a decent dinner.

I think anyone can find something on the menu they like. Since this is a new location, it was packed. My Mom and I really wanted to go here, so we decided to be a part of the madness. However, we got seated right away in the bar section. It was a bit rocky after that. We didn't see a waiter or waitress after sitting for about 15 minutes. And almost simultaneously two ladies walked up to us and asked what we would be having to drink. Now we never really figured out which one was our waitress because they both checked on us and brought us things. I'm not complaining.  I had the Thai Coconut Lime Chicken, but substituted it for shrimp. My mom had the Grilled Steak Medallions with mashed potatoes. I enjoyed my food and so did my mom, but she complained that the portion was small, which was surprising for Cheesecake Factory. They're known for their portion sizes. However, I couldn't eat all of my food, which was a good portion size so I shared. After the food, we didn't have room for dessert.

134,Jayson T.,"Lyman, United States",1,3,,2.0,2017-06-10,"I enjoy eating out now and then.  I'm a bit of a foodie who doesn't mind paying for a good experience.  One thing I'm opposed to is paying a good bit for a poor experience. We've eaten at Cheesecake Factory in Maryland, Charlotte, and here in Greenville.  This experience in particular was quite bad overall but I'm not sure if it was due to a ""changing of the guards"" in how the Greenville facility is run or maybe an isolated incident so take it with a grain of salt.   We walked in and were promptly seated but in a way that didn't make sense to most guys. A string of tables in front of one long bench/booth with chairs toward the dining area. People seated at each end and we were sat right next to one couple with probably six empty tables beside us. (Why does this not make sense to guys? Because it's similar to bathroom urinal etiquette. You don't go right next to someone else until you have no choice.  It's common courtesy to give space.)  So with the music blaring so we couldn't hear each other at typical conversation level from three feet away, we await our server.  I had no clue what I wanted to drink but the other half did so she ordered. After six or seven minutes the server (I believe her name was Amy) returns and begins to take our order but nay, the kobe burger is no longer on the menu and she disappears once again to the kitchen to check if it is, in fact, still available.  Nearly ten minutes later she returns again without mention of the burger but ready to take our orders. Our orders were taken and eventually returns with my beer but the water I ordered didn't arrive for nearly ten more minutes. I honestly wondered if she failed to hear me state I'd wanted a water as well. The spinach/artichoke dip was to come as our appetizer which alone was a disappointment to me. Far too much bitter spinach with a small amount of milky broth and parmesan melted over the top. It wasn't but three or four minutes later that our main dishes arrived. I imagine I had ""that look"" on my face because they offered to take it all back to the kitchen but it was too late. Sitting under a heat lamp is no better than in front of us at the table. This is very poor timing on the part of the kitchen manager making sure things go out in a timely manner.  Our server checked back if I wanted a refill on my beer which I was definitely in the mood for by now.  It never did come....  Neither did water refills.  Amy disappeared several more times between bringing the check, taking our order for cheesecake to-go, bringing boxed leftovers, etc.  I can't in good conscience recommend this place anymore. With an $80+ tab for two people, this is ridiculous. I may give this restaurant another chance down the road but it will certainly be considerable time until I do.    Management needs to be mindful of plate timing going out to the tables.  Servers need to be attentive to their customers needs and actually write something down if you're having a hard time remembering it (yes, this means you, Amy). Maybe question your customers as to where they'd like to sit, seeing as it wasn't very busy at 3pm on a Friday there was plenty of room. And most certainly don't disappear for long periods when the restaurant isn't very busy at all.  If you can't handle the slow times, how you can you adequately handle it when it's seriously busy, as is the reputation here.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenville?start=20,2.44,2.58,2.58,2.6960000000000006,2.524

20,Brett H.,"Travelers Rest, United States",57,188,491.0,4.0,2017-10-13,"As my job requires me to travel quite a bit I've eaten a The Cheesecake Factory in several cities and have a generally formed opinion about my experience at all of them.  I was meeting a friend for lunch and I arrived early so I was able to request a table not part of the general pop row of seats that share one long bench seat with like six other tables.   As always, the meal started with a bowl of sweet butter served with some bread to put it on.  We stared off by ordering the Chicken Pot Stickers, they are always a big hit.  The Soy-Ginger Sauce is salty and flavorful and the meat is tender and moist.   I decided to venture away from my normal order and instead try the Southwest Chicken Sandwich.  Props to me, that was the right call.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the jalapeño peppers on the sandwich were actually spicy as was the Chipotle Mayo.  As someone who enjoys spicy foods, I may have a new go-to for future visits.  The Toasted French Baguette makes it a little difficult to eat, but does add a nice flavor.  For dessert I asked for a recommendation and the waitress recommended the Lemoncello Cream Torte, excellent choice.  I have to say, the tart lemon with the sweet vanilla cake, streusel and mascarpone was a fantastic combination.  I'm glad she recommended it. I fully expected to be giving this a three star review, but to be fair, this was a far better experience than my last visit to this location.  I'm going to assume the restaurant has just improved and give them a score based on this visit.  I would also point out, this is the score I would give if this were some mom and pop restaurant I was visiting for the first time and not a ginormous restaurant chain located in our local mall.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenville,2.88,2.64,2.64,,2.736

Finally, after I got up to inquire, we were attended by two servers. Our eventual server, Phi was great, and took care of our every request, efficiently and promptly. The food and drinks here were great, and not as costly as similiar establishments.

33,Kimberly K.,"Mauldin, United States",0,1,,2.0,2017-11-13,"The Cheesecake Factory in Greenville, SC really needs an assessment. We waited 45 minutes to be seated only to find that the wait time was totally unnecessary.  The food took an additional 45 minutes and really was not all that great. I have had much better.  I believe the issue in this location is staffing and possible training of staff. Our server was responsible for service in various locations in the restaurant - not efficient- why not a particular area. She often forgot about our requests (to go boxes and a Carmel macchiato).  We eventually asked another sever for boxes and when I stood up to leave she realized I never received my drink and quickly when to the bar to pick it up.  Owners, pay an analyst/consultant and get things fixed. The cheesecakes are worth it NOW but eventually, we'll go elsewhere.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenville,2.96,2.68,2.68,,2.7920000000000003

I had the skinnylicious shrimp tacos which were flavored very well and flavorful .My mom couldn't stop talking about how perfectly cooked and tender her steak was.

I called in my to go  order at 5pm and requested that i wouldn't be picking it up til 6pm and the girl assured me that she would place the order at around 5:35/5:40 so it would  be ready by then.....No it was not !! I arrived to pick  my order at around 6pm the girl kept saying it wont be long or it's on it's way and oh they are bagging it up right now only to be kept waiting yet longer!!  I had to wait there til 6:30 and finally it came out. Not even sure if they weren't the lunch portions as it seemed kind small not the usual generous dinner portions.

26,Heidi S.,"Pendleton, United States",1,5,,1.0,2017-12-29,"We will NOT be back nor will I recommend this location! I ordered the vegan Cobb salad. While it was good, my grilled asparagus was missing. I notified the server and she told me it looks just like the green beans that were in there. I told her I hadn't tasted any. (I know the difference between both vegetables.) She said she would get me ""more"". She indicated later she would not charge me for them. ???? After ordering cheesecakes, the manager came by to ask me how my salad was. He then proceeded to inform me that he would not charge for the asparagus this time, but next time it would be $2 extra for 2 Oz! He said the cost for asparagus was high. I used to work at another Cheesecake Factory and we never treated the customer like that. I felt like they were implying I was trying to get extra food free. This was the breaking point for me as a returning customer. I have a gift card still to be used and I will NOT be using it here.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenville,3.08,2.66,2.66,,2.8280000000000003
