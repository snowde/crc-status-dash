112,Sarah T.,"Huntington, WV",29,165,83.0,3.0,2012-12-10,"I have to agree with other reviews.. giant portions of 'so-so' food. I wasn't amazed, but I did leave full.  I was kind of disappointed with my ahi tuna.. it didn't have much flavor (the ahi tuna salad is one of the few menu items that is not enormous), but everyone else at the table was pretty happy with their food (giant, overflowing plates of cashew chicken.. at a whopping 1810 calories a plate by the way. It should be good- that's all you get to eat that day) The redeeming quality.. the dessert. My group split a strawberry shortcake and a tiramisu.  The shortcake was less spongy than I've had at other restaurants and tasted more like a cookie.. and it wasn't ridiculously sweet. I liked. And the tiramisu.. well. It was Amazing. Loved.

I usually go there for just dessert. On this trip, we had cheesecake and drinks for our birthday (a friend and I have the same birthday). I got my old standby, the Tuxedo cheesecake. It is delicious.

88,Lauren H.,"Sterling Heights, MI",178,155,29.0,2.0,2013-03-08,"Most people know what to expect when they walk in here- it's a chain where they serve overpriced decent food and have amazing cheesecake also expensive.  My recent experience last month made me obliged to write this review... it was the service.  I have been to this specific location twice, the first time had service that wasn't memorable but this last time it was absolutely horrendous.  My boyfriend and I ordered our meals, then only saw our waitress again when she dropped off our food at our table... nevermind that we had empty drink glasses, wanted to order cocktails, and wanted more bread.  Then, while we were eating I had to flag over the manager to request refills on our beverages- the manager didn't even apologize for the waitress.  We decided to order cheesecake at the counter to go because we did not want to be at the mercy of the waitress or have our tab even higher for a waitress who barely deserved the tip we left for our meals.  I am more than understanding if it is a bustling evening during the peak dinner time- this is in a suburb of Indy (not downtown Chicago) and was a Tuesday night at 9pm... the rush was over if there was one for the night.   Side note-What is it about Cheesecake Factory's that require the seating to be as close as possible?  It's like a requirement for a new restaurant opening to cram in as many tables as possible.  I would rather wait an additional 10 minutes for a table to open up that can actually accommodate me and all my food on the table instead of sitting at a little 2 top sandwiched between 2 other tables!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=100,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003
76,Wanda M.,"Indianapolis, IN",465,716,5598.0,3.0,2013-04-02,"We had a special event a few weeks ago at this location for 16 of us; many of us had not seen each other for a couple of years which is why we explained and requested the Rotunda.  Our reservations were misunderstood and the service was LESS than desirable but our dinner reviews were 3 to 4 stars and one 5 star from our group.  I will preference this review with the Manager, once aware of seating and vast service issues did everything in his power to correct our unhappiness with the experience. The Manager was phenomenal and handled the situation with grace and we only wish we had made our situation known sooner to him. Apparently we were told our waitress was the best they had...??? Hard to believe!!!   Our Manager comp'd appetizers and desserts for the entire group which helped many of the groups ruffled feathers in the beginning.  However, several will not return due to the numerous issues experienced.   The Managers' effort was greatly appreciated and most did enjoy dinner so another chance could in order.  Even if we had interrupted folks in our booth getting in and out, there wasn't room to stand around the booths socializing with our friends without disturbing the family seated at the center table of the rotunda which we requested with our reservations.  The Managers game plan was to take over their table once they left to allow us space to move around from the 4 booths we were in. However, they stayed for hours, and rightfully so!!!, visiting with friends showing off their new baby which didn't resolve our situation as planned since they left as we were receiving desserts.   Regardless, we felt the evening was a bust!!  Basically, due to being separated into 4 separate, private booths, we only conversed and dined with the 6 friends confined within our booth. Because of this, many people couldn't mingle so hello and goodbye was the extent of their conversations.  Our total evening for dinner, even with the Managers assistant, from beginning to end was 4  1/2 hours!!! All were frustrated from the beginning with our seating arrangements to the length of time it took to correct and pay our bill. 4  1/2 hours is unimaginable for dinner here regardless of the size of the party or the 4 booths to serve. On a positive note, my husband stated his Club sandwich was the best he'd ever had. It was not lunchmeat but instead shaved turkey chunks piled high on his sandwich. The Chicken Carbona, Roma Chicken, Eggplant sandwich and the Steak Diane at our table was enjoyed by our group.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=40,3.4,3.4,3.4,3.0200000000000005,3.4000000000000004

He said that it's a horrible idea, because if you loved it, I'd use more and more and it would eventually kill you. Three stars for The Cheesecake Factory. I'm so screwed. For some reason. I am glad I live so far away. This place reminds me of a grade A--M.C., television channel series? It is the one where some guy runs a chain of fast food chicken restaurants.

75,Andrew L.,"San Francisco, CA",207,134,222.0,4.0,2013-06-04,"The Cheesecake Factory has been on my ""list-of-restaurants-to-go-to"" for a long time. I am proud to say I was finally able to cross it off my list today. I must admit, I had high expectations going in but the Cheesecake Factory exceeded all of my expectations. The restaurant chain has locations spread throughout the U.S. and today I visited the Greenwood location for an Easter afternoon lunch with my lovely parents. Upon walking into the restaurant, my first thoughts were that the place was very nice and that it had an almost ""high-end"" feel to it. When I was presented the menu, I was a bit confused though. What was said to be the ""menu"" looked more like a short novel. It especially felt this way when the waitress instructed us to turn to page 8 for a list of lunch specials (page 8 was about half way through this ""menu""). It was a bit overwhelming at first. After navigating through the menu for about 15 minutes, we finally decided on our orders. I ordered the Crispy Chicken Costoletta and my parents ordered the Chicken Madeira and the Carlton Salad, respectively. The Chicken Costoletta was lightly breaded, served over a creamy, white sauce and garnished with finely sliced lemon peels. It was accompanied with a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus. Honestly, this may have been the best meal I've had in the year 2013. It was that good. All of the flavors complemented each other very well and the chef prepared the food perfectly. My only regret is that I didn't save room for cheesecake, but luckily I was able to take a piece to go. Given the fact that the place is called ""Cheesecake Factory"" it shouldn't come as a surprise that their cheesecake is really, really good. I ordered the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake and it was one of the best pieces of cheesecake I have ever had (the best cheesecake I ever had was at One Market Restaurant in San Francisco). It was a combination of fudge, chocolate cheesecake and vanilla mouse, and yes, it's as good as it sounds. I am greatly anticipating my next visit to the Cheesecake Factory and I look forward to trying new things from their voluminous menu. I would encourage anyone to go and try one of the many cheesecake flavors they have, in addition to any of the main course options. You can't go wrong at the Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=40,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.056,3.3200000000000003
91,Andrea G.,"Indianapolis, IN",17,102,20.0,3.0,2013-06-23,For the most part I like the Cheesecake Factory especially now that its trying a lite menu.  They certainly have something for anyone with their menu reading more like a book than your average menu.  I really like their pasta carbonara and of course their cheesecakes.  Their Godiva chocolate and lemon raspberry are always good choices and if the fall their pumpkin is a fun selection.  The service is hit or miss here.  I've had great experiences and then I've also had drinks spilled in my lap with little more than a quick apology.  It is noisy so it may not be the best place for larger groups.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=100,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.9560000000000004,3.2800000000000002
115,Pam P.,"Indianapolis, IN",2,39,293.0,3.0,2013-07-21,"Came here for lunch with Husband & Relatively spry Mother In Law (age 90, tiny little thing) who has a wheeled walker. They don't appear to have space for walkers to ""park"" while the guest is at a table.  The tables are pretty close to each other thus compounding the problem. I didn't see any ""handicap"" tables on a quick survey inside.  The restaurant was relatively full.  The walker sat next to the table like another chair was added.  The guests at the next table had to shimmy to get by it, the tables are that close. The entrees were great as usual for me & husband.   My MIL ordered off of the ""diet"" menu (SkinnyLicious) since she wanted sandwich and salad but NO soup or bread on the side, and that was the only way to order that combo that we found.  She doesn't eat huge portions to begin with. Her mixed greens salad came without any dressing at all on it (she ordered with extra dressing on the side as she always does). We had a waiter in training.  He was accompanied by his trainer.   It seemed long time before they checked on us to realize no dressing at all had been provided.  The trainer handled it when the trainee didn't seem to believe there was no dressing.  Once they did bring dressing, apparently it was a pretty flavorless vineagrette.   She ate half her chicken salad sandwich, which she said was good (and took half home). I had Pasta Da Vinci, he had Pasta Carbonara.  My MIL liked our pasta better than her items to my judgement. We all 3 had cheesecake for desssert, I had plain w/ strawberry topping.  Flavor is awesome but the cheesecake itself seems ""fluffy"".  I'm used to a denser cheesecake I guess. Hubby got one with lots of ""stuff""  like candy pieces & chocolate etc.  A bit sweet for me but he liked.  MIL got key lime and we all liked it as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=80,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.9560000000000004,3.2400000000000007

When the order was placed, however, our food did come out pretty quick. The food was delicious and no one had a complaint. We did have to ask several times for drink refills, and I had to ask for parmesan on my pasta di Vinci; which typically is offered when they drop off your food. When we were all done with our meal we of course ordered cheesecake. The cheesecake was delicious, however everyone at the table was given a drink refill but me.

I don't even understand why that bread is so delicious.  The firecracker salmon is a decent enough size, that it's really my meal. It's delicious salmon wrapped in spinach and a crispy wrapper, on top of a bed of red cabbage and a sweet sauce that makes the red cabbage into a crisp, fresh salad on its own. The Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake has that right about of chocolate cake and mascarpone cheesecake that just melts in your mouth... JUST GET IT, OKAY?! It is ALWAYS packed. I don't even understand it.

119,Mark V.,"Indianapolis, IN",5,70,98.0,2.0,2014-01-25,"Well, I had decided for the most part to give up chain restaurants for good.  That is until the company Christmas party.  Guess what?  I won a certificate to Cheesecake Factory, so why not do a review.  Overall, this place is a train wreck, and I have no idea how this place stays in business.  People stop wasting money on garbage like this and find some better places to eat, and save a lot of money in the process.  Just click on my lists of reviews.  I will help you get to better places.   First of all you come in and guys with guns grab your wallet and purse. Take all your cash or charge a huge sum to your credit or debit card.   Ok not literally!   I left there feeling taken advantage of.  Two people could easily spend $60 to $80 and that would be without alcohol.  It was freezing cold so I ordered coffee at $3.00.  Why will people shell out $3.00 for five cent cup of coffee?  I don't understand this is ridiculous to say the least.  (Remember I am working with a gift card and that is the reason I did.  I didn't want any balance left on the card which would force me to come back.)  $2 drinks are crazy, but now places are charging $3 for what a local gas station would charge $.79 for the same thing.   Ordered the pizza at $12 as an appetizer.  It was the best thing I had there but that isn't saying much.  The sausage on the pizza was great.  The mozzarella cheese was fresh and made in house.  However, the crust was limp and doughy and the sauce had no flavor.  I think it was a 10 inch and overpriced in my opinion. Everything was overpriced as I looked through the menu.  I was going to get the fish and chips for $17.00.  I asked the waitress to find out if the fish was fresh or frozen.  The fish is frozen she told me.  $17.00 FROZEN FISH!  I just wanted to get up on my chair and scream to all the customers to get out and start listing all the great local restaurants we have in Indianapolis.  You can charge $17 for fish and chips but you can't use fresh fish. OMG!  I went with the $12 chili rellenos burger.  I am not sure if the burger was fresh or frozen at this point I just wanted to eat and get out of this nightmare.  The burger was nice size but lacked seasoning.  The problem was the chili rellenos on top was a greasy mess and tasted awful.   I have ate really good chili rellenos and this was worst one I have ever had.   You have $1.50 in food cost and charge $12 but you can't even make it good.  I didn't like the fries either and I know those were frozen and came from a bag in the freezer.  No fresh made fries on this $12.00 plate of garbage.      I didn't have the cheesecake on this visit, but I have had it before.  I know people love this, but I think it is just slightly above average and way overpriced at $7-$8 per slice. I have ate much better cheesecake at other restaurants.  Besides, who wants to eat 1000 plus calories for dessert....NOT ME!  Portion size is not an issue as I watched plates come out to the tables, so I can understand a slightly higher price point.  However, mediocre food is still mediocre food regardless of portion size.  This place is for people that have more money than they have common sense.  If you are bored of chain restaurants and think for yourself and are not manipulated by millions of dollars in TV commercials to make yourself believe you have to eat average to below average overpriced food at some chain restaurant, I am one of you.  Let's all keep supporting the true food scene in Indiana.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=80,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.7280000000000006,3.0800000000000005

They have perfected nearly every dish - as I've never had something here that was bland or anything but delicious. The salads are always fresh and this is one of the few places in Indy you can get pine nuts added to a caesar salad (try it!), the Italian dishes here are divine, as is the pan-Asian cuisine. Personally I like to order a few small plates and share among the table since the portions of some items can be HUGE and overwhelming. The corn cakes are one of my favorites and the cheese bites are great too. And you can't forget about the cheesecakes - over 20 options to choose from!

122,Greg D.,"Rushville, IN",0,4,,1.0,2015-08-03,"Ok, was excited to try Cheescake Factory for the first time. I can't deny it's role in ""Big Bang Theory"" got me interested. In fact, when my wife and I were having trouble deciding where to go, I said, I got it, follow my directions(she's driving). She gave me a funny, but curious look. So off we go. We get to Greenwood Park Mall and says, ""hmmm, have we been here before. I said no and then she guesses Cheescake Factory, because we have been to the Fridays there a dozen times.   We enter, I'm surprised by the size, especially it's ultra-high ceilings. A hostess is right there, she asks how many and I tell her 2, then ask her ""Is there bar seating?"" She replies yes, I ask if we seat ourselves, she says yes and we head that way.(9 times out of 10 we sit in bar areas at places like this-primary reason-no kids around). My wife usually prefers booths and we found an open one and sat down. A waitress shows up promptly and says with a distressed look on her face, ""Did they seat you here""? I reply, ""No, the hostess said it was self-seating in the bar"". The waitress replies, ""only for those sitting at the bar"". (I never hinted to the hostess I was looking for 2 bar stools at the bar). So I explain, ""Oh, this is my first time hear, I didn't understand that. So then, can we sit here?"" She says, ""I guess, but it needs to be wiped down"" in a fairly unfriendly manner. I said, ""That's fine, it just needs a quick wipe"", joking that the ""last people here were pretty clean"".   So, the confusion thing seemed over with, but we waited at least 5 minutes, when I reached the conclusion that between this ladie's attitude and the wait to get a busboy to come wipe our table, this experience might not even get better. (cue in back of mind-""Big Bang Theory"", the episode where Penny screws with Sheldon about sabotaging his food).   So I decide we're leaving. Well, the cheescake display is in front of us and I decide to order a whole cheescake to go(white-chocalate, rasberry truffle- MMMMMM, very, very rich)and this gives me time to ask for a manager.   Manager arrives, I say, ""I'm choosing to not eat hear for lunch today, would you like to know why?"". He does, so I explained how the confusion of which seats are in the ""bar area"" and which seats are not, which seats are ""seat yourself"" and which seats are not, added to a non-friendly reception from the waitress, made me lose faith in the restaurant. He then explained the design of the place, which area was bar and which areas were not (extremely strange set-up, very undefined, kind-of sectioning the bar area off, but kind-of blending the far side of the bar area into the family side). The protocol of the bar/family-side, who seats who thing, was now finally getting clearer.    So then, this has been a little twilight-zoney already, but the first part was nothing. I asked the mangager, ""So, should I return to this restaurant to give it another chance?"" He said, ""Yes, you should"". I say, ""Why? He looked puzzled, apparently nobody had ever asked him for reasons to dine at the restaurant he is managing. He sure didn't have any reasons at the top of his head and gave he this funny look (the only thing it reminds me of is when my kids were little and I had to take one of their bottles away for a second). So then I express my very real questions about eating at a place where the manager can't give me any good reasons to eat there. He starts getting uptight, says I didn't give him a chance. So I say, ""Ok, try again"" and back up a step and put my arm around my wife in a ""I'm ready to listen"" stance. So, he starts out by asking me a question, rehashing the seating thing. So I answer him, but he doesn't let me finish my answer, interrupting me. I said, ""You asked, let ME finish"". He then says, ""You didn't let me finish, you won't give me a chance"". I say, ""No, Sir, I gave you plenty of chances and you failed miserably"".     This could have been the end of it, expect he walked away mumbling, then turned around, walked past me mumbling something. So, I said, ""You know, I understated it, YOU are a failure...as a manager. My advice to you is that you should find an occupation more suited to your skills"". Before I got that out he muttered something else, which prompted me to wrap it up with the phrase, ""You just plain suck at it (managing)"".    Again, the white chocolate rasberry truffle cheesecake was amazing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=80,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.9160000000000004,3.3200000000000003

45,Marie R.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,5,,5.0,2016-02-02,"I love Cheesecake Factory.  I really love the one at the Greenwood Mall.  And there are only two in the entire Indianapolis metro area, which leads me to my only complaint:  They are ALWAYS packed and wait times can sometimes be lengthy.  In good weather, no problem because you can wait outdoors; however, in rainy or cold weather, you are packed like sardines in a small area.  Ugh!!!! Now the good things:  The 32 page menu with so, so many excellent choices!  The wonderful, knowledgeable servers who hustle and work hard for a living and will do their best to make you a satisfied customer if you give them a chance.  I have been there three times in the past three months and enjoyed everything I tried each time.  My favorite was the miso salmon, which I cannot rave on enough about.  I also liked the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta; however, I really like spicy foods and this could have been spicier for my palate, but is still great as is and this is not a complaint.  I love potstickers, and their chicken potstickers do not disappoint!  YUM!  The Caramel Royal Macchiato is to die for and is huge.  It was great after coming in from a cold winter day of shopping.  It was like having dessert.  Everyone I dine with LOVES the cheesecake......of course!  When I eat dessert, which is not very often because I am too full from the wonderful food offerings, I prefer plain cheesecake and it is wonderful.  My friends prefer the many and varied flavors offered and they are always happy with them.  I also enjoy the pleasant atmosphere of Cheesecake Factory.  I realize some people complain about the prices at Cheesecake Factory, but I personally do not feel you are paying too much, considering all you get: the atmosphere, great servers, huge portions and wonderful flavors.  I also appreciate that there are lunch size portions available until late in the afternoon at reduced prices, but their ""lunch portions"" are still very large, in my opinion.  And, as unusual as it may seem, their lunch portions are available on weekends, not just week days like some places.  Overall, I give Cheesecake Factory at Greenwood Mall two thumbs up and will definitely return......OFTEN!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=60,3.16,3.16,3.16,3.8600000000000003,3.1600000000000006

Like others have commented the menu is the size of War and Peace, can you imagine prep time for all of that? Decided on the grilled pork chop, wife got the bang bang chicken and shrimp combo, kid got the grilled cheese. Pork chop was good, moist all the way through, sides of mashed potatoes and green beans were competent, wife's meal was good, too much rice for me even the kids grilled cheese was good.  Service was kind of slow, slammed for a Sunday afternoon our waitress was overwhelmed, once it lightened up was much more efficient she was very nice and apologetic. Cheesecake was wicked good, huge not sure what it cost as it was free, if it's free it's me, could have ate the whole thing myself, kid and wife got in the way.

My boyfriend asked our waiter if we could keep a menu for later. That was a very good idea on his part. I saw other customers having to ask their server for menus later on and that just seemed very inconvenient for these busy servers. Everything we had was simply amazing.

Making a dinner there a guaranteed wait time.  My favorite thing about The Cheesecake Factory- Their giant menu. It has every type of cuisine so no matter how large your party everyone can find something delicious (or many things!). Hence my recommendation to put your wait time to good use by asking for menus and mulling over your carvings prior to getting seated. As a creature of habit I usually go with the Spicy Cashew Chicken (ps- you can ask for it not spicy!) Every once in awhile I will mix it up and go for the chicken pot pie smothering biscuits or one of their numerous pasta selections.  I am also a fan of large portions. Their prices are a little steep for one meal, but when you make it two the math works out perfectly every time.  And of course we must mention their cheesecake. I've never had a bad piece and this is definitely an area of the menu that I like to mix it up. My favorite piece that I truly melted over was at my most recent stop- Their Peppermint Bark Cheesecake. It was light and fluffy, not a true dense cheesecake and it has the slightest hint of chocolate to balance the mint. Not to mention the sprinkling of peppermint bark on top.

We arrived before their dinner rush and we had a very short wait; we put our name in and almost immediately got called for our table. The hostess brought us to our table and was very pleasant but when we got to our booth the seats were COVERED in bread crumbs and the hostess watched as my fiancée knocked off all of the crumbs so we could sit instead of taking us to another table that was actually clean. It looked as though a large group of rowdy two year olds crushed up all of the bread and  and threw it on the floor and on our seat. It was not  clean at all. After sitting down I noticed the music was very loud and we were struggling to hear each other. Our server arrived she didn't tell us of any specials or suggest us any dishes she just asked what we wanted. But she was very nice. We ordered our drinks and shortly after they arrived and she also brought bread. Which she forgot to give us plates for our bread. Which is very small inconveniences but they add up. The reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 1 like I wanted to is because of the food. It was delivered about 15 minutes after we placed our order. It was all very fresh! I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp, my fiancée and his grandmother got the Catfish, and his brother got the Ribeye cooked medium-well.

24,Tori C.,"Indianapolis, IN",29,106,95.0,3.0,2017-06-09,"My boyfriend and I had both never tried the Cheesecake Factory before and decided to try it out on a Friday night for our anniversary. We both had friends that told us it wasn't worth it, but we actually both really enjoyed it. I don't think we would have picked it as our anniversary dinner if we had been there previously and knew what to expect, but we are still glad we tried it.  We were seated immediately around 7:30pm on a Friday night, but the table was less than ideal. We were at one of those really long booth areas with small tables and then chairs on the other side. Convenient when pushed together for large parties, inconvenient on a date when there are two different couples approximately 2 feet away on each side. We could hear both conversations throughout the dinner. We were disappointed we got sat there because there were plenty of open tables, but I'm sure they had their reasons so we didn't ask for a change.  We each got an alcoholic drink. Sangria for me, pineapple mule for my boyfriend. The menu didn't have prices for alcohol and once we got the bill we were less than thrilled to see they were $10.50 each. Pretty steep price.  The meal includes complimentary bread and butter, which was good, but not spectacular. I ordered the chicken parmasean pizza style -- it was DELICIOUS. It was off the ""special"" menu inserted. It was a large chicken coated in bread crumbs and covered in marinara in cheese. My boyfriend truly thought it was a pizza. Then on top there was angel hair pasta in alfredo sauce. I loved it -- he wished he had ordered it too. He got the four cheese pasta and added chicken. He liked his, but was definitely envious of mine. The servings were big enough to fill us and we both still took leftovers.   We got a slice of the Adam's peanut butter and caramel cheesecake to go. Very good and just the right size for us to share! The menu also didn't list prices for cheesecake -- $8 for this particular slice (not sure if that varies??) Overall -- delicious food and we were glad we finally tried the place out. However, the meal was $75 for two people before tip which was pretty pricey. This is definitely not a place that I would go to ""just because."" Yet it didn't really fit the bill as a formal restaurant either. It was one of those in the middle type restaurants -- great and expensive food but still casual (and crawling with kids)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood,4.04,3.56,3.56,,3.7520000000000002
23,JR F.,"Plainfield, IN",23,61,56.0,3.0,2017-06-11,"Overall a great experience as far as food and service, but there were a few draw backs to dining at the Cheesecake Factory.  Walking in your greeted by the hostess in their spacious waiting area and right in front of you is a giant display of all of their mouth watering cheesecake options. Seriously, so mouth watering. The average wait time is about 15-30 minutes but lucky for us, we were seated immediately.  The menu has a WIDE variety of food ranging from pasta and salad to steaks and shrimp. The portions provided are very large and definitely something you'll have to pack up and take home. However the cocktails were pricey for what they were. Nothing special or unique. Just expensive. (AND THE MULES ARE NOT IN COPPER CUPS!? What?)  The restaurant has many seating options for all different party sizes. (Long tables, high tops, bar top, booths, outdoor patio) whatever you may prefer they'll have a table for you. My main complaint is that the tables are very close to each other and it makes for a impersonal experience in my opinion. Also, this place is extremely expensive for what it is, we paid $90 for two people. Glad I got to try it but I probably wouldn't return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood,4.0,3.57,3.57,,3.742

The waiter was very attentive and did a great job refilling our drinks.  My only complaint was that during dessert I ordered a latte and my latte came in a tall glass instead of a coffee cup.  The complementary bread was delicious - hot, crusty on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  I could seriously fill up on the bread alone.  We ordered mango chicken from their new menu and it was delicious. There were small chunks of mango in the dish with the perfect ratio of mango and chicken.

When dinning the cheesecake factory you can rest a sure that there will be something tasty for everyone. It's a Classic American  menu with the wide variety of options. The inside is very well decorated with a elegant vibe, my dining experiences was very  pleasurable. The Cheesecake Factory is a perfect place for a great for date night, or a birthday dinner. You have to absolutely try the fried macaroni and cheese balls as an appetizer and they are simply amazing and one of the main reasons why my family and I dine at the cheesecake factory because the macaroni and cheese balls are fried to perfection with crispy crunchy golden outside and a nice creamy layer of cheesy macaroni goodness on the inside ...food for the gods !!!! For dinner I order the filet mignon with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Steak was prepared very well, and side also matched full of flavor.  Now for desert .....how do you come to the cheesecake factory without dining on a piece of cheesecake ????

38,DonnieBillie P.,"Madison, IN",11,12,5.0,2.0,2017-09-23,"We took our adult kids out to a birthday dinner Thursday evening. We had a very personable and professional waiter who took out order in a reasonable amount of time. Everything after that was very unfortunate I got my meal and we waited for the other three. The manager came out and explained something about a problem producing my husband's order and  asked if he'd like anything else. He didn't have time to wait and then eat so he declined. Eventually my sons meal arrives and he was happy with it. After another wait of about 10 minutes the birthday girl's chicken alfredo arrived. By then I had been done for a while, and my son was nearly finished so he ordered dessert.  Birthday girl found a tiny worm I her meal after a couple bites. The manager was very apologetic and professional as well. She brought out a full cheesecake in apology.  Birthday girl ordered another meal and eventually a birthday choir sang to her and brought her a slice of Oreo cheesecake. Which she loved.  My son still didn't have his dessert. We asked again.  In the end, we were charged only for the 2 alcoholic drinks.  We appreciate the comp and the nice staff but this place was having serious issues.

21,Nikki M.,"Indianapolis, IN",27,12,1.0,2.0,2017-09-24,"Unfortunately, I don't think we will be back to the Greenwood Cheesecake Factory location. Our food was fine and our server Peyton had a terrific personality and great attitude despite being slammed in a bar area she had to herself. I could even forgive that the hostess stand messed up and underquoted our wait time by nearly double (quoted 40 min, but sat in us 75 for a table of 5). What did it for me was witnessing the hosts tell a manager the situation, watching the manager come to the host stand and avoid eye contact and refuse to acknowledge us. Then when we were being seated, I expressed my displeasure about the excessive wait time to the host who said she would have a manager come speak with us.  A manager never came. It would have cost the restaurant nothing to simply come and say, ""we messed up and we are sorry you had to wait longer than we told you, but we are glad you stayed. Let us make it up to you."" Instead, nothing.  The ONLY reason we didn't leave was we were celebrating my step-daughter's birthday and she chose this restaurant 2 weeks ago and has been looking forward to it. We have celebrated her birthday there every year for the last 4 years. We waited because it was what she wanted, but she even said afterwards that she won't choose here next year because no one ever came to apologize.  I worked in restaurants all through high school, college, and graduate school. I know how things work. We weren't looking for anything for free, but a manager who cares about their restaurant and their server knows that evaluating the satisfaction or lack thereof by a patron is fundamental to the success of the business. It is essential to ensure a server isn't subjected to an irrationally angry customer as much as it is to win over a dissatisfied customer and ensure they come back.  As far as chain restaurants go, I had considered (up until recently) Cheesecake Factory a step above the likes of Applebee's, Chili's, or TGI Friday's. This experience tonight showed me it isn't any better from a service perspective, it just has a larger menu and a higher price point.  For the money, there are better places to go like Stone Creek, Fireside, or Revel. Skip the chains and spend your money with locally owned establishments who value their customers. That's what my family will be doing from now on when dining out on the south side.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood,3.64,3.54,3.54,,3.5800000000000005
