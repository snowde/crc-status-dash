386,Brian V.,"Bergenfield, NJ",3,24,,4.0,2012-01-22,"My rule of thumb applies specifically to this place. Rule of thumb states that if a place is packed at lunch or diner than they are doing something right. If you don't want to wait and hour to sit down and eat than quit squawking and go somewhere else, i mean really its that simple.  .          My favorites are the kobe burger the navajo sandwich and just about any salad on the menu they are large very large. Stay away from there steaks they are a bit pricey and a little small for the coin your shelling out for them not to mention they just aren't that good. The selection of cheesecakes to choose from is quite nice and the portion is quite nice also. If your a fan of carrot cake or strawberry shortcake i would recommend them also the the slices are huge.     I have never had a problem with the service here it has always been excellent the place gets really really busy so if your waiter isn't back in 2 shakes of a lambs tail with drink refills or something extra take it easy and enjoy the scenery.Come to this place early for lunch on the weekend 11:30 to 1 if you dont want to wait to long.If your gonna get your panties in an uproar b/c you don't get seated right of way at 6:00 pm on a fri sat sun than do yourself a favor and go someplace else. It cracks me up how people call this a chain restaurant your not gonna get food like this at tgi fridays or applebees so its really not fair to compare them to those types of low standard eateries.

290,Jessica K.,"Hillsdale, NJ",21,349,53.0,2.0,2012-07-17,"First of all, this mall is in serious need of a few hundred more parking spaces. Good luck finding one when it's busy. Rather than wait for a table here, because there always seems to be an evening wait, I opted for takeout. Their website advertises a seamless curbside experience, but this requires a phone call to notify them you've arrived. And that'll only happen if you've managed to actually find a space in a ""designated pick up spot"". I waited a solid 10 minutes (the max limit for the pickup spots) but NO ONE left or came outside during that time frame. Fed up & impatient, I parked on the opposite side of the mall. Sure, you can have someone wait in the car for you right at the front, but in my opinion the narrow road makes navigating around your car a little difficult for other drivers. When I've dined in I've always thought the atmosphere is noisy, the tables are cramped, the table service is not bad, but not very good either, with the exception of those behind the takeout counter. They've got it down pat. Drinks & desserts could be worth the rare visit for me, but not the food. With an endless menu, much of it tastes mass produced to me, like cafeteria food. You're lucky if you choose wisely because it's a hit or miss list of stuff.

Let me put it another way - since the Thai Lettuce Wrap app was $9.99, but is now $12.99. That's awhile.  To fully appreciate the Cheesecake Factory you need to follow a few tips:  1) Sit in the bar area - it's less noisy and crowded, has more efficient service, and TVs for sports. 2) The menu is humongous, so let your server help - figure out what you're in the mood for and let the server make recommendations. You'll save lots of time and energy. 3) Portions are large, so share apps and don't eat all of your meal - otherwise you won't have room for cheesecake. 4) Get cheesecake! But first carefully look over your options by going to the cheesecake display counter and fully peruse the selections. It's life changing. Then consult the expert - your server. It really helps. You'll learn stuff.  If you follow these simple tips you'll have a fun, enjoyable, entertaining, tasty, interesting, and fulfilling dining experience. If you don't you'll over eat and feel stuffed, uncomfortable, have no room for cheesecake (but you'll get it and eat it anyway) and then you'll fall asleep in your car and get in trouble with your wife, husband, girlfriend, boyfriend and/or weight watcher group leader.

Our waiter was friendly. There were two menus to look at-the regular one and the light one. I ordered french country salad and crab cakes appetizer plus side of mashed potatoes and my friend ordered tuna appetizer. Waiter suggested another tuna dish and after that another tuna dish with the explanation that my friend's choice was too small. Somehow it turned out into  a longer discussion and my friend ordered original dish anyway.  Salad arrived with a long hair in it. We pulled it out and showed it to the waiter. His reply was that his manager will stop to say ""Hello""... It never happened. My crab cakes were undercooked. Bommer! Mashed potatoes were cold. Another bommer! It took forever to get refill of an iced tea. While waiting to be seated I noticed a lavish display of desserts which had a separate counter.

I ordered a small Greek salad and the soft shrimp tacos.  There was more feta on the salad than I'd gotten at a diner for lunch a couple of weeks ago.  And the tacos were surprisingly tasty; a bit of a kick, served with lime wedges and a decent (tho' not fresh) salsa.  The ersatz Mexican rice had peas & corn in it, not great but passable.  Can't complain, for the price($12.95)! My mother-in-law didn't like any of the menu options, so we asked the server if she could have just plain grilled shrimp with some sides.  She was very agreeable, saying that their menu is so vast that they can meet almost any special request.  So Mom received 4 (5?) grilled shrimp, with a large portion of mashed potatoes that she loved, and a good-sized portion of steamed fresh broccoli. My husband enjoyed his grilled fish tacos, served with a side of rice and black beans. Did I mention that each of the tacos had a slice of avocado on it also?

When the tacos came out, we noticed that there was cilantro not only inside but sprinkled on top. We asked the waiter to take it back so, he did. Then, he came back with the same plate (although it looked like the cilantro was picked off a little bit) and said that it was parsley. No. It was still cilantro. A lot of it.

The bad (brace yourself): The food! I had the steak Diane & Salmon combo. My steak was overcooked for being medium well. Both meats were bland. The mashed potatoes and asparagus were the only tasty items on my plate. My sister's Bang Bang chicken looked and tasted  like regurgitated indian food. Yuck!

After waiting an hour for a table, which is common here, we waited an additional twenty minutes after our buzzer went off. Typically if the place is packed this is understandable, but when they start sitting groups (of the same number of people) that came in after us there is a problem. Our extra wait was due to having small children with us. In my opinion this is unacceptable. My children are very well behaved, even with a hour and a half of wait. But the staff there simply continued to sit others. When we approached the hostess, she was very dismissive and extremely rude. They just don't really care!!

Food-wise, I ordered the lunch carbonara but it didn't quite do it for me. I kept thinking about the pasta carbonara I had at another restaurant in Central NJ the whole entire time and how I wish I were eating that one instead. It might be because the carbonara at the other restaurant was made with prosciutto which made it more tasty but here at the Cheesecake Factory they just use tiny bacon flakes. I would skip this next time and suggest to the restaurant to consider putting prosciutto in their carbonara dishes because it would be a wonderful improvement. The peppery-ness of the lunch carbonara here was good though, keep that. I'm giving this review 4 stars despite so-so carbonara because of the service I received from my waiter today.

As long as I have living relatives, I am sure the road of my life will always lead to a Cheesecake Factory somewhere in the country. My family, and my wife's family, and most peoples' families I know, all have a special place in their heart for the Cheesecake Factory. Me, well? Not so much.

I am a firm believer that the more items on the menu, the less spectacular the food. The Cheesecake Factory bucks that trend ever so slightly, for with literally 100+ items to choose from, you'd flat-out expect all the food to suck by my formula. But the food is OK. I have yet to find something on the menu that would give me cause to give them more than three stars, but you could certainly do worse eating elsewhere. Here's what I think MY perfect Cheesecake Factory scenario would be:   It's been a long day, say, having attended a bourbon festival with friends for hours on end. We've just gotten done telling our driver that for all the booze they had at the festival, there wasn't much food to eat, and now we're starving. And, of course we all have both feet in the bag. As we drive down the highway, we spy a Cheesecake Factory, and ask the driver to make a stop. In an unusual twist of fate, we are pleasantly surprised to find there is no wait for a table. In fact, not only is there no wait, there are no screaming children to be found anywhere. Still, we decide to eat at the bar. Once sat, we get a few more adult beverages, and then proceed to order *EVERYTHING* on the appetizer menu.

293,Jen And Chris P.,"Richmond, VA",1,8,,3.0,2014-02-22,"What we ordered: - Dynamite shrimp, yum! (especially the chipotle sauce) - Fried calamari, yum! - Pasta Da Vinci, ok (two of us liked it, the other two of us were meh about the sauce) - Crispy chicken costoletta, yum! - Grilled mahi mahi special, BIG FAT NO... - Key lime cheesecake, yum! - Oreo dream extreme cheesecake, yum! Food: 3/4 stars Everything was pretty tasty. The appetizers and cheesecakes in particular are delicious. Our main complaint was the ""grilled mahi mahi special."" The dish came with two small pieces of fish, while the other 2/3 of our $21.95 plate was mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli (most which were yellowing and looked unfresh). The fish tasted OK, and was only slightly better after slathered with lemon sauce. Do not recommend this dish in particular. Value: 2 stars Portions are large, but still way overpriced. Definitely unhappy about how much we paid for the mahi mahi. Service: 3 stars The wait to get a table is way too long (especially on weekends! We came Saturday at 2:30 and had a ~30 minute wait for a party of 4), and the waiting area is crowded and has limited seating. Parking is also a pain in the butt. However, our waiter was great- informative, attentive and not too overbearing. The food also came out pretty quickly.  Ambiance: 3 stars Clean, well-lighted, pretty average décor.

Service is hit or miss-just depends on who you get and the mood they are in. The wait is ridiculous and I always find myself asking why I choose to wait an hour and a half to be sat for dinner. I guess it's not the restaurants fault-people like it and show up to eat-but perhaps they should expand the seating area or have a lobby where you can order appetizers while you wait.  So my experiences here have always been a 50/50. If the food is good, the service is not. I usually find the servers to be absent more than they should be during the course of the meal.

Now, let me start this by saying that I realize this is not a diner and that done of these things may just be personal grievances. First off, my coffee mug was dirty as there was food remnants stuck to the outside. More than that, when someone orders coffee, why would you not bring cream and sugar? I ordered coffee, a custom omelet with mushrooms, ham, peppers and cheese with potatoes and toast.  If someone orders toast with their meal, doesn't it makes sense to bring pats of butter and/or jam? Who wants to eat plain dried bread? In general I want impressed with the food. It wasn't anything I couldn't get elsewhere.

First they forgot my sweet plantains but somehow they put them on my boyfriend's plate, so he thought it was his and ate them. Kinda made me sad lol and then when I actually tasted the dish it lacked in flavor. Like it's crazy how a little bit of salt can make a big difference in a meal.

185,Jun C.,"New York, NY",25,173,107.0,3.0,2015-02-12,"People like making jokes about the Cheesecake Factory, but the food here is actually pretty good.  In fact, despite its status as a chain, it serves better quality food than a lot of the independent, classy restaurants you may find in the American suburbs.   Food: Taste is obviously the most important aspect of a restaurant, and most of the food items that I have tasted at The Cheesecake Factory have been excellent.  Two other big reasons why I like this franchise is 1) the quantity, and 2) the range of choices.  The Cheesecake Factory is famous for having absurdly huge portions for all of their meals.  I would consider myself a fatty when it comes to food, but even I don't have a high success rate here when it comes to finishing my meal in one sitting.  Also, it's great that the menu here is so varied, and gives us a wide array of different foods to choose from.  A personal favorite of mine, which I'm admittedly embarrassed as a grown man to order, is the ""Cajun Chicken Littles"" lol.  They are essentially chicken fingers, but with Cajun seasoning and spice on the thing layer of breading, with very tender white meat on the inside.  Another good one is the ever popular dish, the ""Bang Bang Chicken."" Decor:   I like how this place is set up.  There are plenty of tables and the restaurant is very big, but the tables are separated by booths and barriers so that despite the large number of customers, it still to a degree feels like a private experience, and doesn't feel all that like you're sitting in a giant room with strangers.  They also keep the lights dimmed throughout most of the day, and the dark yellow/orange/brown colors make it so that it looks even darker than it is.  This dim lighting, combined with the comfy cushioned seats and the massive amount of food, admittedly makes me tired every time I'm here.  I just want to curl up in a ball and go to sleep haha.   Service: I haven't had any complaints about the service here at all.  Every server and employee that I have interacted with here has been incredibly friendly and helpful.  The wait time for the food is never too long, but the waiters and waitresses will still come by often to check up on you and bring you drink refills before you can even ask for them.  They also keep the bowl of bread full as well.   Overall, I can see why The Cheesecake Factory franchise is so widespread and still seemingly thriving.  Don't let the fact that it's a chain prevent you from trying out the food, which is very reliable and tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack?start=160,3.28,3.4,3.4,2.9560000000000004,3.3520000000000003

Their chicken and biscuit dish was yummy as well. Of course, the highlight of the restaurant was the dessert - cheesecake. My favorite still has got to be the original cheesecake, but I also enjoy the Oreo cheesecake and red velvet cheesecake.

I like my eggs over easy but these must have been in the griddle for 10 whole seconds.  The salsa and avocado on top made the meal edible.  The tortillas were completely soggy.

She offered to exchange the drinks. The manager then came to our table to ask what the problem was. He proceeded to explain that when you order a drink with less ice, you get a glass that is not filled, just as ordering a soda with less ice you will get less soda. We were shocked he came over as this was already resolved. We explained that we know what to expect when limiting ice as we always order drinks this way so they don't get watery and we ordered this very drink a week prior at Cheescake. We further explained that the issue was a regular not an Ultimate was ordered. He said okay and again mentioned the glasses would not be filled.

Like all other chains - it's hard to resist being able to feed the entire family and the adults get their slosh on all for under $70 (and that's with some serious doggie-bags to bring home).  Similar to Donald Trump's current lead with the GOP's - you can't help but admire that the Cheesecake Factory is so brazen and in-your-face and just plows ahead with ridiculous portions and could care less about obesity and heart disease. The pizza lunch special - the salad was completely okay for a few mouthfuls of lettuce and a sliver of tomato. Their Portofino Pizza - surprisingly good crust, solid amount of chicken and peppers.  Only real gripe was the thin and watery pesto that was leaking underneath to make the pie soggy.

Although there were a lot of people waiting in line, since the place is so massive, we were sat in about 5 minutes. Our waitress was really friendly, as was the busser fellow who brought everything out.  What really won everyone over at our table was my order of Hibachi Steak -- a large portion of Hanger Steak (which I asked for rare) which was cooked to perfection and incredibly tender, on a bed of bean sprouts and onions, with a side of skin-on red-potatoes and wasabi butter, accompanied by a sort of light teriyaki sauce -- this dish was banging, and my friends kept offering to trade me bites of theirs just so they could keep taking more bites of mine. Oh, and the breads they brought to our table, three different types, were warm and delicious. My friend's salad was everything she expected, while my other friend's Chicken Tortillas came with excellent beans and amazing corn cakes but the main component was underwhelming. For dessert, I didn't care much for the Lemon Meringue Cheesecake but the Key Lime Cheesecake was absolutely addictive... I never got to eat at chain restaurants or even fast food as a kid, and living in NYC it's really never even been a consideration for me, but I've always heard great things about the Cheesecake Factory and now I know why.

No green garnish, no tomatoe, watery cheese sauce, just all white pasta and cheese. Extremely bland cheese at that. So bad that I couldn't make myself eat the whole thing. I just ate the chicken.  For $19.50, higher than most places,  I was pissed. The Passion Fruit ice tea had no passion. I don't know how they made it but it was VERY bitter and had no fruit taste at all. Had to put about 6-8 packs of sugar to get it to taste somewhat good but then got a s u gar rush to the head after 3 packs. So headache, bad dinner, stomach ache. The cheese and bacon tots tasted terrible. There was creamy, watery cheese inside :-( My husband's fries were stiff and practically stale. The carrot cake is dry, doesn't use the traditional icing. Moreso got strings of carrots and nuts than cake batter. :-( Only good thing: Lemonade, mozzarella appetizer, cheeseburger. Serve and hostess was good and very polite.

167,Alexandra S.,"Rutherford, NJ",0,15,6.0,1.0,2015-10-03,"Let me make one thing clear...this review for the majority is not based of off the food served at Cheesecake Factory. After having an extremely poor experience at this Cheesecake Factory, I reflected on what had actually happened before writing this review as to not overreact. One evening about 2 months ago my boyfriend and I decided to venture to CF, I was having a craving for cheesecake, and the food is also pretty decent. So we were off to get dinner. When we arrived the the hostess took our name down and told us that it would be a short wait, which was fine. When we were seated it didn't take very long before we knew what we wanted to order because we always get the same thing. Our server came over and was polite. We placed our order with him when he arrived, for me the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic, and for my boyfriend, a cuban sandwich. We also ordered an appetizer, fried calamari. Now for the appetizer we had a specific request, neither myself or my boyfriend like the tentacles that are normally served with fried calamari so we asked if we could have the rings only. Now this is something that we have asked for on more than one occasion and at more than one CF. The server said that there was no problem and left the table to go put in our order. A few minutes later he came back to the table and told us that he was sorry but that his manager said that it was against policy to serve the fried calamari without the tentacles. I explained to the server that we ask for this every time we come in and it has never been a problem, we asked to speak with the manager... A man came over, unfortunately I do not know his name, but he was very nice and told us that he would oblige our request for us. He did explain that it's not normally something that they do but that he would do it for us. A few moments later our fried calamari came to the table with the tentacles, so it seemed like there was some miscommunication. We explained to the food runner that the manager said he would make our order rings only, this she was not aware of, so she took the plate back to the kitchen. A few minutes after that a woman came charging over to our table and said, ""just so you guys know we can never do this for you again!!"" I replied by telling her that we already spoke to a manager and everything was taken care of. She condescendingly replied, ""I'm the manager and I don't know who told you that we do this but we don't, It's against our corporate policy!!"" I told her that this is a regular occurrence and that we have never had such a problem before. She argued with me that she doesn't do this for anyone and that our request would never have been granted at HER CF and that if corporate found out that she did this she would be in a lot of trouble. At this point there was no arguing with her. Every thing we attempted to say was shot down by her. She was so unprofessional. She had no interest in giving us a good guest experience from the start. She was right and that was it!!! We asked her for her business card with every intention of complaining to corporate and as she went to give us the card she just tossed it at us like she was doing us a favor, and then stomped away from the table like the beast that she was. If you are planning on visiting this CF remember a few key things. 1. this place is run by a female dog named, Stephanie Bucciarelli, on a power trip who obviously has no training on how to give customer service. 2. Be prepared for a mediocre experience with an upscale price tag. and 3. get your order of cheesecake to go as to spare yourself from the rudeness that is oozing out of this place. 4. If you have a complaint, voice it, because without feedback issues cannot be known or corrected. Needless to say that my boyfriend and I have not visited CF since. P.S. Many other chains like Houlihan's, Long Horn, Olive Garden, even Maggiano's don't even serve the tentacles or will hold the tentacles with no argument. I don't understand why this caused such a big problem, never has this ever been an issue at any other restaurant establishment no matter what the cost. I would think that with CF's price tag that they would want to cater to their guests and keep them as returning patrons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack?start=180,3.32,3.23,3.284,2.436,3.266

127,Marianne W.,"New York, NY",5000,940,15318.0,4.0,2015-12-07,"My family would make the trip to this mall at least monthly many years ago. If you live in NYC and want to eat at Cheesecake Factory this used to be the closest location. We also like the feel of home we would get from shopping in a Mall such as this one.  Like most reviews say, it is higher end stores. I like the Barnes and Noble location. You can always find gifts in there. During the time we went to this mall it was undergoing renovation. It has now become very luxurious inside. The tile floors and glass roofing are great. I love the seating area. When you shop until you drop you can sit down to rest comfortably in the mall.  The reason we don't shop here any longer involves the transportation. In Winter. We had to wait in the cold on the highway for the bus to and from NYC. I remember one day climbing over huge piles of snow to cross the highway to get the bus back to NY. I can't tell you how many times we would be flagging the bus down as it passed us by. It became to much trouble and unsafe to be out on the highway.   Someone told us about Park and Ride and the bus going to the Mall in Wayne. We started going to Willowbrook Mall. It is much easier to access from NYC. I often wonder if they started providing bus transportation to and from their parking lot. An over hang with protection during inclement weather would be nice at The Riverside Shops.  If you don't live nearby, or own a car keep this in mind when you go.  Maybe if enough people express an interest they will help us by providing this service. I would certainly like to return to Hackensack for a visit. The food and service were always great at this CCF.

We were able to get a seat right away nonetheless as this location can accommodate a lot of patrons. We started off with the chicken quesadilla appetizer. It was very tasty, although the portion of guacamole that we received with it had black chunks of avocado. Not a good look. One thing I hate that some restaurants do, this one included, is that they don't list drink prices on the menu. We each ordered a sangria. It was served in a wine glass, mostly filled with ice. They came out to be $11.50 each. Definitely not worth the price. Should have none better : / keep that in mind if you go here. For my entree I order the chicken parm sandwich. It was definitely flavorful and tasty, however, the portion was small.  Overall, the food is good here. Good quality as well. I just feel like you don't really get your money's worth here.

116,Bharath B.,"North Bergen, NJ",0,5,,3.0,2016-03-06,"So went to cheesecake factory at Hackensack yesterday, must say it took 15 mins to find parking... with a baby we had to wait for 30 mins to get a table. We were lucky to sit while we were waiting and there were many seniors and kids waiting to sit before they got a table. When it's cold outside, restaurants need to give people some extra seating arrangements at least while waiting. Ordered kale quinoa salad and veggie melt sandwich with fresh tomato basil mozzarella flatbread app. The Good: Veggie melt sandwich was heavenly. Even as I sit the next day I can feel the flavor calling my name. It was just rightly balanced with lots of veggies and less cheese. The toast on it was crunchy and you can hear that if you run a knife on it. Rustic and Awesome!! The Fair: our TBM flatbread was too good to look at (artistic and all)... however one bite and I knew someone had gone overboard with salt. Surprisingly the hubby was ok with extra salt, so, mheh... who cares for skinnylicious qpp having more sodium :p The Ugly: the so called super salad was horrible. First it was like someone just threw torn kale on a plate. Then inspecting a bit I could see quinoa. The taste was not right. Basically kale is a bit bitter so instead of making a salad with a hint of kale for bitterness, the entire dish was bitter. Cut grapes here and there helped a bit but once there were no more grapes left, it became inedible. The waiter was great to get me extra bread to cleanse the bitterness from my pallet. So all in all, it was an average experience.

I was craving for a taste and I looked up the Cheesecake Factory and realize that they are a franchised and their are at half a dozen near me within driving distance and one in a place I used to live, Hackensack NJ. The web site menu had more than a dozen cheese cakes and had take out too, which made it even more convenient for me since now I don't need to do a solo sit down just for dessert. The decor of the Hackensack restaurant is nice and it is big with two dinning sections and one with a full bar. They have a parking lot and they are part of the up-sale River Side Mall. So it was easy to do some shopping and have a bite to eat on my visits I must have gone to the Cheesecake Factory 8 times and half of that I stayed to eat there. Always for dessert, and mostly for cheese cake, the other times I had Strawberry Shortcake, Black Out, and Carrot cake. So for the cheese cakes I had Oreo, Strawberry, Godiva Chocolate, Red Velvet, Snickers Chocolate, Salted Carmel, Lemon Mousse Meringue, and White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle. And this is only a third of what is available. They all taste good and better than you would think from a franchised restaurant, but of course some of the cheese cakes tasted better than the others. They are light cheese cakes and they don't give you oversize slices, with lots of cream and pliantly of strawberries for the strawberries cakes including a 6 inch round mini. My top three are: 1) Strawberry Cheese cake and the Shortcake. 2) Salted Carmel 3) Raspberry Truffle The atmosphere and staff were friendly but real busy so be a little patent they will get to your needs ASP..  One note is the cake slices are huge like 10 inches high so plan on shearing with someone and make it even more fun.

Once we were seated and ordered drinks the waiter asked us if we were ready to order right away, which I have never had done at a restaurant usually they wait a couple of minutes before asking.

172,Krystin B.,"Lodi, NJ",0,22,1.0,1.0,2016-07-21,"A place I used to call my favorite when I was younger has turned into a place I will never go to again. Not only did I give this Cheesecake a second chance after a terrible experience with undercooked filet mignon 2 years ago BUT I absolutely blame the restaurant for ruining a surprise birthday dinner I planned for my boyfriend. Let's start with the fact that this crazy busy joint on a Wednesday night in the middle of the summer does NOT take reservations. So going in there 2 weeks early in the blistering heat and finding out they don't take reservations was disappointing enough. I had to carry on and plan for my party of 12 to arrive an HOUR early (7PM) and get a table. Well, simple tasks just aren't simple. As I have someone from my party arrive early , the host tells her the table will take an hour to get. ""Perfect,"" I thought. Wrong. Not only did I have to stall my boyfriend until 815 PM but my surprise did not go as planned. Since a party of 12 adults for a birthday was not the restaurants top priority (and 3 parties of 4 is) we show up at 830 and the host says another 20 minutes (after telling my friend 10 more minutes when I was on the way). Well of course we had to ask for a manager and OF COURSE that is when magically an open table for 12 appeared. To compensate for the ruined surprised we got FREE NACHOS (yay [NOT] )! The service was nothing to brag about. The food and the drinks were probably the only thing I was satisfied about. To add to my disappointment, I asked the host who should I speak to about sending a cheesecake to the table for the birthday boy. Not only did I tell the host ""a whole cheesecake"" and that my boyfriend does not like chocolate & to make it a cherry cheesecake, BUT when its time to sing happy birthday, they brought one peice of cake and it was chocolate. One last thing: my friend who came in early, as well as myself, and another person from the party requested seperate checks (to the host, manager, and server). Once that time came our server Shey acted as if it was the end of his cheesecakefactory career to split the checks. Now, I have served tables for over 6 years, I get it, it sucks and its a lot of trouble to do, BUT we were are party of 12 from the ages of 23-30!! We all have jobs and proper morale to know how to TIP SUFFICIENTLY if that's what the server was worried about. Well anyway to wrap it up, this cheesecake (and most likely others) have lost a customer due to terrible service, lack of priority, and because they disregarded each request I had. For a place that you can easily spend 500$ on a full course meal, I suggest going to a mom and pop bar before experience this mess of a business.

We sat down to find a very friendly waitress Kendal. We ordered our drinks and my 1 year olds food. Spaghetti and meatball.  Her food came right out. I tasted her food as always. Restaurants tend to undercooked pasta for children just to get it out. Anyways when I tasted it it was beyond salty and still kinda raw. The server was very sweet and took it back to the kitchen. She totally understood. She came back very upset stating that the manager couldn't remake the pasta without salt. This raised several questions to myself. A restaurant this large with so many locations, who claim to make everything here. They don't have a pot to boil water and make pasta? Well I asked to speak to a manager. A sloppy looking manager with his shirt untucked and stains under his armpits came to the table. Very offensive told us he can not do it. Every time I asked him if they had a pot to boil water he would respond, the pot we use has salt. When I asked if I looked at the kitchen would I find a pot, cause I would cook I if they don't want to. At this point he told me they would do it but would take a long time. As if he was trying to selling me out of buying the pasta. Needless to say my daughter loves pasta. About 15 mins later Kendal returned with a huge smile with the pasta. Again I tasted it the pasta was still undercooked and still salty. Looks like they used pre cooked pasta and tried to wash the salt off. COME ON... the server felt so bad telling us she wanted to cool it right for us but she isn't a cook.  the 3rd time it came out I thought for sure the manager would stop by the table. Nope it was the server. Pasta still had salt on it but st this point I was tired of waiting  I got the Shepard pie which was average My wife got the grilled salmon with mash and asparagus. She asked for it cooked med and it was charred on one end  We asked them to hold the food until my daughter food came out. It appeared that the food was made and it just sat. Mine was cold and my wife's was at room temp at best. So no one really ate since my daughter takes naps at 12 and started to get cranky. She always naps after lunch today she didn't eat lunch. Thank Cheesecake Factory  So when the check came out I thought I would see the manager maybe get an apology from him for my kids food. Nope We were charged full price even though my daughters pasta took a 35mins to be cooked right!

Why call us up if we're gonna have to wait 5 extra minutes for a table to clear up? My aunt and grandma can't stand up for long as they have knee issues so they were definitely feeling annoyed. But whatever. When we sat down, it took a good 10-15 mins for a server to come and ask us for our drinks. Like I know the place is packed but still. We were also missing one small plate and we had to ask two different servers to get one.   My family and I shared buffalo wings, calamari, crab cakes and the egg roll sampler. I got the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and it was very dry so I asked for more sauce. It tasted alright but the chicken tasted like it had too much olive oil. I think they refried it. I wanted to try some cheesecake because they're famous for the cheesecake so why the hell not? So I got the chocolate hazelnut crunch cheesecake.

I did not complain, I simply poured it into the first glass I had and took the shot, to my surprise, it was WATER!!!! Now I am livid, I called over a random server and told her about my drink and she didn't seem surprised at all. She took it away and our original sever came back with a new drink.

Never had a bad meal or a bad experience here... until last night. My buddy and I ordered two rounds of the same drink each. Ketel One and club with a splash of Campari. We were taken aback when we received the bill and saw that they banged us for $20 worth of Campari. To be charging $5 extra for a SPLASH of Campari is outrageous. Never experienced this anywhere else.  We talked to THREE managers. They each gave the same ''this is corporate policy'' BS. ZERO effort made to help us out with the inconvenience. We were expecting the ridiculous $20 Campari charge to be taken off, but they couldn't even offer up a coupon and couldn't even utter a ''sorry'' to us. This is absolutely inexcusable. Not to mention we ran up a $160 bill as well... 2 rounds of drinks, an app, entree and dessert to go... EACH.

It is Easter Sunday and I wasn't in the mood to cook so I figured I would go out to eat I thought it was perfect that they were open but I have to say the service and the food was horrible. My nearest Cheesecake Factory is the Newport Mall location which is normally very busy and a little annoying crowd wise so I figured I would try this location because it was only 30 minutes away from me. The wait time was not bad however the waiter I had was not good at all. It took 10 minutes before someone came to wait in my table I was with my son and my husband, when my waiter (Samir) arrived to my table he introduced himself and asked  to take our drink order since we knew what we wanted we ordered an appetizer and our entrees together. The drinks came very late we got our appetizer before our drinks when our drinks arrived our food took another 20 minutes. I have to say I am very disappointed by the quality of the food at the Riverside Mall location I ordered a grilled salmon with sautéed spinach and asparagus it was literally only cooked not seasoned at all not even a pinch of seasoning. I have had the same entree at other locations and it was amazing this time I was beyond disappointed. I told Samir that I was not satisfied with my food and the reason why I was unpleased and he seem to make me out to be crazy by looking at me with a confused look as if he did not understand my issue. He went to the kitchen and brought back a new plate of sides exactly the same as the original with no flavor what a ever. My husband ordered fried catfish which he said was also cooked poorly. Samir did not take any responsibility for his job he did not show any concern or made any attempt to try to satisfy us in anyway. I didn't even bother to ask for a manger because I felt like it would be a complete waste of time I got so upset I left my husband to wait for the check after waiting an additional 20 minutes for Samir to return with it.

The host offered indoor or outdoor seating, but we chose to go to the bar because we were in a slight crunch for time and bar service is usually quicker. Our bartender was really nice, forgot his name but made me a pretty weak Long Island Iced Tea. It came in a huge glass but tasted like too much sour mix... I'm a 102 pound girl 5 feet tall, I usually feel tipsy off one glass of wine....sooo... don't know what happened there. It was kind of difficult to get his attention, even though we were the only bar guests there. He was preoccupied stocking and cleaning or whatever and paid little attention to us. I ended up sucking down my drink like a lemonade and enjoyed my meal, regardless. The Sheila Salad definitely brings this review back up to 4 stars because it was phenomenal! Food came fast and hot, delicious and perfect!  I love the interior of this particular Cheesecake.

Lol  I've been here plenty of times but it has been a while. My recent visit was yesterday with the fam per their request. There was 45 minute wait but we were seated in about 30 minutes which was a world record for me coming to Cheesecake Factory establishments so off to a good start.  Our waitress was pretty attentive and very energetic in a good way. She went a head and took our drink orders as we were still deciding of what to eat. As we got our drinks, we went ahead and ordered our meals. I ordered the Jamaican Shrimp with black beans and rice and plantains. I was expecting a mediocre dish at best based on previous experiences lol but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised it had a decent flavor and tasted pretty good. My daughter ordered the Four Cheese Pasta. which she enjoyed but I tasted it and was not impressed at all. I didn't taste 4 cheeses and the flavor was bland to average.My son had the Mac N Cheeseburger which he enjoyed and the fries it came with tasted very good. He crushed it. Kids both ordered cheese cake slices which of course is the one thing they do have that's pretty Damm amazing lol and earned the right to be called Cheesecake Factory. I am not a big cheesecake person but I have to admit I like their cheesecake's in particular.  Overall listen it is a huge Chain spot and the food is okay you pay more for the name than the overall quality in my opinion. The sister company Grand Lux Cafe to me has way better food quality.

I also love that they serve the best warm and soft bread when you sit down. It's definitely a perk of eating here! For dessert, you have to get the cheesecake! That's a given. Some of my favorites include the Oreo, s'mores, snickers, & the plain strawberry. I've had many things on their menu and everything is always good. Some people find them pricey but they do serve big portions, so there's room for left overs !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack,2.92,2.94,3.128,,2.932

26,Catherine Edre B.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",27,1,,1.0,2017-10-09,"My first review on yelp, mainly because i had a bad experience with this restaurant. I ordered on the phone for pick up, a margarita pizza, chix Alfredo, chopped salad and two cheesecakes. Said 25 mins, okay sounds reasonable.  I Come in after 25 mins to pick it up, they already charged me for it, so I thought maybe the food was ready. Waited for quite sometime only to find out that my food was just waiting in the kitchen to be picked up. First of all, don't charge a customer whose order is not even ready to begin with and has to wait for 20 mins to get it. Now, I get my food finally and I check it out and the Pasta they used was penne instead of linguini. I didn't ask for it, and it looked like slop. Manager was there and I asked him if it normally comes like this, he then apologizes and I changed it to angel hair. Waited again for another 30 mins, all for a corrected Alfredo. It has been an hour that I've been waiting. They couldn't even communicate to rush it. Finally the guy in the counter saw me and tried to rush my order from the back. I finally got it and didn't even bother to check it.  Now comes the tasting part. The pizza, as you expect, was already cold. It was a bit undercooked too. I can still taste some raw pizza dough. Sauce was good tho. The salad was okay, had balsamic vina. The only bad part was the chicken, it was one of the leftover ones you get from the slicer. The end pieces of the chicken. They didn't bother to chop that. The two cheesecakes were good, as expected. But the damn Alfredo, was a disaster. The sauce was not even seasoned, along with the chicken they use. It was like eating reduced heavy cream with just a touch of parm. Horrible, so horrible. I can't believed I payed for that slop.  Just come here for the Cheesecakes, that's it. Everything else, just a big N-O. NO.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack?start=20,2.76,2.89,3.116,,2.838

The server warned us, but did not attempt any guest recovery! He offered a free cheesecake? Servers don't have any authorization to provide comped items for guests. Instead of sending a manager over, we had to request for one to explain the situation. There is no reason for us to pay for these appetizers. The whole point of ordering an appetizer is defeated.  Overall it was an extremely disappointing experience. I've had much better service.

He made up for our not so great last visit, in which we were hardly getting any attention from our waitress perhaps due to our table location (outside facing the indoor shops) and she didn't look very happy working there. In contrast with the last server, Angel was super attentive, made sure we were happy with everything and maintained a very positive and friendly attitude throughout our dinner, which was very refreshing to see. I can see he enjoys his job and takes pride in what he does, which is so rare to see these days... nowadays too often we encounter unfriendly service and I wish more waiters would smile more just like this waiter Angel. We were observing him and we were impressed how hard he was working so I decided to ask his name, so that I can surprise him by mentioning him in my review. I come here quite often but I must say he was the best server I've ever had at Cheesecake Factory.

16,Anne S.,"Paramus, NJ",0,11,7.0,1.0,2017-12-26,"This review is solely based on the food experience. I would give ZERO stars if I could.  It was my family's first time at The Cheesecake Factory after they reloacted to the other side of the mall but if I can turn back time, I wouldn't have gone there.  The food was inedible and I still cannot believe that the food came to our table in the condition that it did. Our family went on Christmas Eve around brunch time, probably a bad idea for future reference.  The food took FOREVER to come out, although the restaurant itself didn't seem as packed as it would be on a usual Sunday brunch time.  When the food came out, the server informed me that the plate was VERY hot, so becareful.  At first glance, the food looked ok.  I had ordered a meatloaf, took a bite and it had a burnt taste so I looked at the dish more carefully and I saw that all four outer sides of the meatloaf was burnt.  Our waiter came to check on us and I told him that my meatloaf is a bit burnt.  He asked if we wanted anything else to replace my dish but I declined since we waited so long for our meal to come out and told him I'll just eat around it.  I took a bite of the mashed potato that came with my meatloaf and it was quite cool and the outer part was some what hard - almost as if it had been sitting out for a while.  I then tried to eat the ""unburned"" part of my meatloaf by trying to cut the burnt sides off of it and flipped the meatloaf around only to find a disgustingly burnt meatloaf on the othter side.   I wanted to speak to the manager at this point so we were waiting to flag down our waiter.  Our 10 month old baby was getting fussy while all this was going on so I tried to give him some pancake from one of my kid's dish.  I grabbed the pancake with my hands and I felt a hard, crunchy texture - almost like a toast! I flipped the pancake over and that too was burnt! Our waiter finally came around and we told him we NEED to speak with the manager.  He was more than willing to get the manager so we waited.  While we were waiting, my husband and I were questioning all of our food so we took a bite from the other kid's dish - spaghetti and meatball.  My kid is 2 years old and he was just happy to finally eat his food so he was just digging in but when we took a bite, the pasta had a rubbery texture and the pasta was all clumped together.  Five minutes later, a chef or a cook wearing a cook's uniform came to our table.  I showed him my dish, and explained that my child's pancake was burnt and that he should try grabbing it to feel it himself.  I also told him the spaghetti is either undercooked or it was sitting out too long because it has a rubbery texture.  He looked at our food and told us that the meatloaf and pancake is definitely burnt and apologized.  He asked if we would like something else to replace our dish, but we declined and told him we just want to pay for our drinks and one ""edible"" dish that we barely touched because of everything that was going on.  The chef/cook left and our waiter came to the table and informed us that the bill had been waived so we didn't need to pay anything.  My children were still cranky so my husband had to goto Smashburger across the mall from The Cheesecake Factory to get some burgers for them.  I'm just sorry to my three little children who had to spend an hour at the restaurant without having a proper meal and I'm sorry for myself for losing my appetite and I'm sorry to my husband that our meal was a disaster.  I'm also sorry for our waiter who had to get the chef/cook and apologize on behalf of the cook who cooked or tried to cook that food for us to eat.  If I could, I would like to see that person try to eat the food that was sent out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack,2.56,2.73,3.028,,2.662

The hostess was horrendous and the manager did NOTHING to compensate us.  First when we entered the hostess told me to stand with my double stroller behind the hostess desk. Which honestly I was just going to ignore. Even though I felt she was trying to hide my double stroller or something. Instead I sat down anyway. To make more room I decided to take one of the detachable seats off the stroller and place it in the car. It took all of 45 seconds, my car was right outside. When I got back my mom said someone came to sit us. I went to hostess desk to inquire. Omg she was the biggest b*#tch. Almost laughing that we were going to be put on the list again. Even after the person who came to sit us came back saying it was okay. At this point we are arguing and I asked to speak to the manager. The girl was pointing and rolling her eyes at me it was completely ridiculous. The manager finally comes and they sit us in the 'bar' section. (Because people sitting in the bar really want to be entertained by my two young children.). The manager apologized but did NOTHING to rectify the situation.  Our waitress was however very nice.

31,Jacqueline G.,"Bergen County, NJ",0,20,,3.0,2018-01-02,"To start off, I really love The Cheesecake Factory. The menu is big offering all different types of food and I've never gotten a meal I didn't love. I've been here twice since they moved to the other side of the mall, most recently yesterday, 1/1/2018, with my sister after a little New Year shopping. One thing that baffles me is why, when rebuilding, they didn't open the foyer area up more. You come in and are given a pager and told your wait time and then after it goes off you wait some more on the other side of the hostess stand. I don't mind waiting & always come prepared to wait because I understand the high demand of this place however waiting on top of strangers in heavy coats is frustrating since they just redid this place and had the chance to fix it. Moving on - we were seated, given menus and soon realized it was going to take our waitress awhile to get to us as another table next to us was flagging down other servers trying to find her. I'm assuming she had another section to wait on since I rarely saw her in the area, which is fine but if you're going to give a server two sections try to make them somewhat near each other that way she can easily check on both. Eventually she came over and took our drink order, which, thank God because between shopping and the wait, I was thiiiiirsty. I got the Shrimp and Angel Hair Pasta from the Skinnylicious menu and my sister got the Mac n Cheese Burger. I love the Skinny menu because I usually order apps (all time FAVORITE is the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes - GET THEM) and can still order a meal and not feel like I can't breathe after. My sister asked to sub out regular fries for sweet potato ones and was told that's fine however when the food was brought out the woman delivering it said ""Oh yeah we don't have any more sweet potato fries so we gave you regular fries is that ok?"" Not having an item is no big deal but bringing the food out and THEN asking if that's ok when its already in front of the patron? Maybe next time take the time to come out and actually ask if there's another side she may want instead. Besides that, everything got devoured pretty quickly and afterwards we ordered a piece of our go-to Dulce de Leche cheesecake to share. Fluffy, sweet heaven is the best way to describe any of the desserts here so always try to save room. Overall, I know I'll be back because I genuinely enjoy the food - just not those few minor issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack?start=20,2.52,2.71,3.02,,2.6340000000000003
