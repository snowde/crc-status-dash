6,Chris G.,"Portland, OR",71,104,75.0,5.0,2017-12-06,So happy that this location opened up as it us much closer than the Beaverton one.  We went here for dinner yesterday and the food was amazing as usual. The menu is like the Torah but that's a good thing because everything on it is AWESOME. You can get pretty much whatever you're in the mood for.

37,Roxy G.,"Portland, OR",0,4,,1.0,2017-12-16,"Worst experience I've ever had at Cheesecake Factory. Hoping it's because it's a brand new location at Clackamas Town Center and they're still working out the kinks. We walked in and was told it would be a 20 minute wait (even though there were several empty tables) or we could sit in the bar. We proceeded to a table in the bar and sat down. A waitress immediately told us we couldn't sit there. I explained that the gal at the front told us we could. Not even 15 seconds later, another waitress came back with the first one in tow, to tell us we couldn't sit there. I again explained that we were told we could sit in the bar. Long story short, we just got up and left, instead of arguing with the 2 ladies! So sad, because I was hoping to have my birthday dinner there later this month. I don't know what the big deal was, especially since there were several available tables in the restaurant and in the bar!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-happy-valley?start=20,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02

The food arrived at 1:03 pm and it was just my salad. A cold salad with nothing but lettuce, chopped veggies, some cheese and dressing. She ordered several appetizer items. She called both Grubhub and Cheesecake factory to complain Grubhub was wonderful and gave her a full refund. What was the Cheesecake factorys response? "" oh well we ran out so that's why we didn't send the rest of your order."" A direct quote. Why wouldn't they send another message like they did before saying they were out of her items? Where is the "" free"" stuff that was supposedly coming with the food? Why did it take over an hour to send out a cold salad if they ran out of her items?

35,Sara S.,"Newberg, OR",42,3,,1.0,2017-12-30,My family of five tried your new establishment today for lunch. We were quoted a 50 minute wait time & chose to do so. We were seated within that time. We ordered our food & our 3 kids food. Theirs arrived in under 20 minutes (Mac & cheese) but ours took over 30 minutes and our kids were completely finished by then. We ordered the Chicken & Waffles Benedict and the Fish Tacos. The syrup that came with the waffles was straight oil. We waited for some normal syrup. The hollandaise sauce was disgusting & inedible! The manager removed it from our bill. When we ordered the Fish Tacos we specifically asked if they had cabbage or lettuce on them. It was not an ingredient in the description but common. Our waiter said no. They arrived with red cabbage. I removed it but along with it came most of the sauce & avocado. The fish was soggy (maybe thawed too quickly) & tasteless. They were not good & I have been burping fish all afternoon. I DO NOT recommend eating at this location until their wait staff had been properly trained on the menu and their kitchen staff can figure out how to decently fry fish & anticipate the amount of customers. The wait was way too long for a seat & way too long for food & very disappointing once it arrived. Our waiter was friendly & apologetic but for their prices I want good food!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-happy-valley?start=20,,,,,

Ordered drinks, then ordered food.  Waited about 10 minutes while noticing that the table next to ours (seated AFTER us) was eating bread..  from previous visits to other locations, we knew we normally got bread.  Had to ask the server then she explained it was baking.  Okay, we'll wait... Got our food..  husband ordered steak tacos without cilantro.  Menu said they came with tomatoes, avocado, rice and crispy onions.  His had only steak and some crispy onions, some marinated onions.  The rice that was served with it was green (cilantro rice, not mentioned in the menu).  To top it all off, everyone's food was cold, especially my husband's! Asked for a manager and when he finally got to our table several minutes later, he was apologetic and explained that what actually comes on the tacos is PICO DE GALLO and GUACAMOLE, both of which have cilantro in them.  He also told us about the CILANTRO rice.  He did get a new meal made for my husband, but it took at least another 20 minutes to get it, after the rest of the table was completely finished.  AND.. the fries were cold! I get that this place just recently opened.  Obviously lots of kinks to work out.  But we ended up being there, between waiting to get seated, waiting for our cold food (first round) and cold food again, it was close to four hours and almost 11 pm!  Manager did not come back to check on my husband's replacement meal.  He did comp my husband food, but nothing else.  I feel like we should have at least been offered dessert!   We won't be back for quite awhile!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-happy-valley,,,,,

We waited for bread, waited even longer for drinks and then apps. Our drinks were empty and all apps/bread gone LONG before our food finally arrived. We finally got out of there at 6:45 (2 HOURS after sitting down) and didn't even want to eat dessert. I ordered a piece of cheesecake to go and was told a manager would have to add it to our bill because they'd totaled it already. Very weird.

Usually, I try to stay away from big food chains because the quality or flavor isn't usually that great. To my dismay, I was quite happily surprised.

Everyone we encountered were very prompt and attentive. We appreciated that very much. The ambiance is delightful. Romantic, dim lighting, and the noise wasn't too loud.  I always do my research before going anywhere new. I checked out the menu to see if they had offered Vegan options. They literally have a MENU BOOK! Lots & lots to choose from. It was a little overwhelming at first.  They have something for everyone whether you're vegan, gluten intolerant, pescatarian, love your steak, chicken, pork, etc. Everything sounded delicious! It was hard to choose, but we managed to narrow it down to the Avocado Egg rolls, Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, and the Diane steak & Crusted Herb Salmon Combo.

Then waited almost as long for our food. When I was ready to order cheesecake to go I asked to have my meal boxed up and instead of just giving me a box, the waitress had someone else take it to get boxed. He comes back and told me that my food was thrown out instead of boxed. A pasta that was almost 20$ and half left was thrown out. Then he tells me to talk to my waitress when I asked about getting a new one or getting alittle taken off my bill. The waitress comes and tells me she will talk to her manager and see what he says, the manager who's name was David as I later found out gave me 3$ off a 20$ pasta. When instead of being boxed up for a customer was thrown out. So I just go and order my cheesecake and leave. I get home and go to eat my cheesecake and open the box to find a half eaten steak and mash potatoes. So I call and ask for the manager. After having a discussion with him over the cheesecakes he tells me he will give me the money back. I call to see and he only put 1 cheesecake back on my card, so I call back again and I'm told by the manager David that he only seen one and he can't do nothing more.

We were there close to the opening and it was still busy, so I imagine that during the dinner rush it will be kinda insane. If you are ordering from grub hub, pick things you would enjoy eating when cooled....cause the food isn't going to get to you fast and hot. If you are there during the dinner rush, just sit back and relax. Even lunch was a good hour, and dinner I could see lasting two. I would go back here in a second, and I will definitely order this through Grub hub in the future as well. And again, a super high five to my server- you deserve a raise!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-happy-valley?start=20,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8

1,Courtney J.,"Portland, OR",161,7,3.0,1.0,2018-01-13,"If I could give this place no stars, I would.  We went last night for my sisters birthday. We had a larger group (10 adults and one child), so we called ahead earlier in the week but they do not accept reservations.  We arrived an hour early to get our name in before everyone showed up, and they told us it would be a TWO HOUR wait. That's ridiculous, but it was my sister's birthday, so we decided to wait it out. The time went by, and long story short, 2.5 hours later we left without even sitting down. There was another large party eating and they were loitering after their meal was done. For a LONG time. The management did nothing to remedy the situation. After waiting that long, nothing. They didn't ask the other group to not loiter. They didn't offer to seat us anywhere else or split our group (at that point we probably would have just done this!) or anything. We all left completely enraged and starving. Horrible experience. Their lack of customer service was disheartening and I don't believe any of us will ever be back. Twelve thumbs down!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-happy-valley,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
