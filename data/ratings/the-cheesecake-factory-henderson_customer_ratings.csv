425,Earl C.,"Las Vegas, NV",40,54,,3.0,2012-01-14,"I don't remember the last time I visited a cheese cake factory but this visit made me realize there are so many other better restaurants out there for the price.  We ordered the flat bread with pears, blue cheese, pecans, and baby spinach. It was good but the portion was pretty small. We also ordered the herb crusted salmon salad. I expected the salmon to be warm but it came out cold. Most salmon salads I'm used to the salmon is nice and warm and cooked medium but it seems like cheese cake factory's salmon was pre-cooked, over cooked and sat in a refrigerator until served. Our waiter seemed like he was in a rush and was not attentive. Overall I'd rather choose a mom and pop shop spend the same amount of money for better food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=420,3.72,3.72,3.72,3.0840000000000005,3.7200000000000006
458,Sarah V.,"Henderson, NV",17,28,156.0,4.0,2012-02-22,"Their ""Glamburgers"" are very good! Le Burger at the Paris Casino is still better, but I was pleasantly surprised! The last time I ate here was a year ago and my fish and my husband's steak were both grossly undercooked...and they MICROWAVED them and reserved them to us. A year later, I didnt get the fish, hahah! I got the Farmhouse burger, so good! Over-easy cooked egg on top. Cant miss it!

475,Annie G.,"Spanaway, WA",265,96,283.0,5.0,2012-02-28,"After church, came to the District. We took the kids to the big carousel so that they could ride. The kids had a blast, shortly after, we walked around in the Whole Food market, and came to Cheesecake Factory. We had a little wait, but it was well worth it. We were seated as quickly as possible. The waiter was awesome. My son had a dish that consisted of meatloaf, mash potatoes, and a soup. I had a seafood sandwich dish that included the sandwich, salad, and a soup. Everything was fantastic. One of my nephews ordered the corn dogs and fries of the kiddies meal. My other nephew had kids pizza and kids Mac and cheese. My mom had a soup and salad dish. And my dad had an appetizer as his dish. The bill for the six of us came out to be about $87.

335,Dawn C.,"Las Vegas, NV",65,331,6.0,4.0,2012-03-11,Brought my little boy here for lunch the other day since we were at a park on that side of town. It was lunch time and the place was packed but even so the wait for a table was only a couple minutes. Our server was very nice. She brought me my most favorite tea super fast..its a passion fruit tea that is just amazing. She even bought my little guy an apple juice in a sippy cup. I had the angel hair pasta with shrimp and he had a grilled cheese and fries. Both came out very fast..which is good since they have some really good bread there that can fill you up. She boxed everything up and even put my tea in a to go cup. Another amazing visit to the factory!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=400,3.88,3.88,3.88,3.12,3.88
476,Sam T.,"Las Vegas, NV",139,185,15.0,5.0,2012-03-29,I have been here probably 5 times in the last 3 months. I can honestly say that out of every single experience we have had great service and the best food in Las Vegas. The menu is so diverse and anyone can find something to love here. I really think this is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. Service never disappoints and once when I made a mistake on my order the waitress had my entree remade to my liking and didn't even bat an eye. Priceless! I will gladly bring friends and family to the Cheesecake Factory anytime!! Can't wait to go back. BTW my favorite dinner is the Spicy Chicken Chiptole pasta!! Love it!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=460,3.88,3.88,3.88,3.22,3.88
330,David S.,"Las Vegas, NV",570,1050,274.0,2.0,2012-04-08,"I came here with two other friends to celebrate one of their birthdays. One of us does not do well with fish or anything too exotic, so the Cheesecake Factory was a safe bet.  The portions here are large, bordering on insane. Some items are average in price to quantity ratio such as the potstickers, but then there are ridiculously big selections such as their chicken nachos. We started with these two appetizers and a few drinks. Looking through their menu is daunting. Flipping through page after page, it all becomes a blur. It took us twenty minutes to settle on our meals.  Many of these plates could easily feed two and my friends did not want to split an entree with me. It definitely made me appreciate their Skinnylicious offerings. All of the items on this separate menu possessed less than 590 calories. It is not like other places that only have a few selections to choose from. No, this was a full blown menu with burgers, salads, pizzas, fish, and more. Looking at this was a task on its own. I ended up getting the Veggie Burger since I am a huge fan of beets. The patty is not like a Boca Burger. It is not condense or have the texture of meat. It is made up of farro, a wheat grain, and the deep burgundy vegetable. After a few bites, I gave up on trying to eat it as a burger and just ate the contents between the bun. It just felt odd to eat all these carbs together. The farro was cooked well and I enjoyed its flavor. It would make for a good salad.  Now comes the real reason to come to the Cheesecake Factory, it is all about their... brownies. I kid, the only reason why I still come back to this establishment is for their cheesecake. The Red Velvet is my go to dessert. The white chocolate curls on the outside makes this treat even more decadent. Too bad, cheesecake does not make for a well balanced meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=400,3.8,3.8,3.8,2.7920000000000007,3.8
432,Mat J.,"Henderson, NV",88,149,13.0,4.0,2012-04-12,"I love this place! I have to admit that we eat the cheesecake more often then the food, but isn't that what the place is named after? My two favorite flavors are Pineapple upside down cheesecake and red velvet cheesecake. I love that there are a ton of creative flavors and you aren't stuck with the boring East Coast Mentality of... plain cheesecake with cherry filling on top, its the only way because it tradition! (they do that have that one too)  As for this location, we like to sit at the bar. Its always easy to walk in and get a seat at the bar even when the place is packed. We find the bartenders full of life and very friendly. An important detail for me is that my drink is never empty... its just a good sign that your server is on the ball.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=420,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.056,3.76

On August of 2011 I went to Cheesecake Factory with my family for my mother birthday (10) people. I understand that this place does get busy and there was going to be a wait. So they told us it'll be a hour wait which we were fine with. An hour past we still waited 2 hours are creeping by so we ask if our table was ready, no not yet. Still waiting and now 5 kids are getting inpatient and crying they are hungry. Now Im getting upset and whats taking so long to get a table. It seem as if they didn't care I had to ask for a manager to get anything done. The manager did try to make the situation better by comp some food but the damage was done for a 2 hrs and so wait. I with to order a cheesecake for my mother and some man that work there made a comment that I had to pay for that. I just brush it off and reply I know that. I will never return to this or any cheesecake factory.

265,Suzy H.,"Henderson, NV",625,204,2211.0,4.0,2012-05-14,"I've eaten at this Cheesecake Factory many times, probably eaten at almost all the locations in Las Vegas. Overall, I'm very much happy with my experiences here. This chain has one of those menus that can please any palate. It takes quite a while to even go through the whole menu, it's about 6-7 pages long. They have breakfasts, sandwiches, salads, appetizers, pastas, seafood, meat, burgers, and of course, their infamous cheesecakes. We actually ordered salads, appetizers, and desserts to go on our last visit. I'd have to say if you do come at peak hours, they will be a wait to be seated.  I can't name all the foods I've eaten here, there's just too many. I'd have to say most of them are good and tasty. We've tried their salads recently, and were a bit disappointed. Just lots of wilted lettuce and not enough toppings. I'm not a big fan of their cheesecake, but I think it's because I prefer the denser version. Their other desserts, the Chocolate Truffle Cake and Carrot Cake, very yummy! Actually, all their other non-cheesecake desserts are phenomenal and huge-portioned. Definitely requires sharing! There's been good service, mediocre, and exceptional service on my visits. Overall, I'd have to say it's always decently good. Usually if it's bad, I remember it. I have tried to steer clean of chains these days, but Cheesecake Factory will probably always stick out in my mind as a go-to place to please many people because of their food and enormous menu selections.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=300,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.088,3.5600000000000005

NO CALORIE COUNTS ON THE MENU!! That means, Vegas is one place where I can eat at the Cheesecake Factory with a clear conscience.  Plus they have a pretty decent happy hour that happened to be going on right when I got into town. There are a bunch of appetizers and cocktails for $5 and beers for $4. The fried mac & cheese balls are great and you can never go wrong with calamari. I was also impressed with the made to order guacamole which was a huge portion! We ended up buying more chips at Whole Foods to eat the leftovers back in our hotel room. There are also quite a few options on the small bites menu including some healthier (ahem, not fried) items like kale salad and ahi tuna.  Yeah it's a chain and you can get Cheesecake Factory just about anywhere, but trust me their food is that much better when you don't know how many calories are in it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=320,3.52,3.52,3.52,3.12,3.5200000000000005

LOL. For my meal, I got the regular size Miso Salmon plate for $19.95.  Start off with big serving of grilled salmon on a plateau of brown rice (or white if you prefer), surrounded by a butter sauce with pockets of sweet Miso sauce and garnished with Chinese peas.  I LOVED the Salmon.  The fish was perfectly grilled and had a wonderful light char on the skin.  The flesh was juicy and flavorful.  Great accompaniment with the Miso sauce.  I personally found that the butter sauce was waaay too rich and appreciated having the Chinese peas around to break up the monotony of  the rich butter sauce.  Other than that, the dish is on point.   The ambiance was great.  Always a vibrant atmosphere with dramatic lighting and decor.  I feel like I'm in the middle of Europe, yet not.  LOL.  This is a place you must visit once in your life.

Love the ambiance love the food.. service is ok.. sometimes they have the tendency to neglect your table if they get to busy.. For starters i would order the spinach and artichoke dip for drinks order their starwberry lemonade Then for the entrees I would order the Herb crusted salmon salad if your feeling healthy or the KObe Beef is rediculuosly delicious..   For dessert i usually end it with a traditional starwberry cheescake if it wont fit take it to go and save it for later for a midnight snack..

424,Christy D.,"Las Vegas, NV",155,95,19.0,4.0,2012-07-02,"Went here just a couple of days ago for my first time. i'll start out with the service first. Our waitress was friendly, funny and on the ball! There was never a moment during our entire meal that we were sitting there waiting for her to show up to refill a drink or help us. And I also want to make note of the fact that each waiter/waitress was dressed in white from head to toe and not one uniform that we saw was out of place. Each person was dressed perfectly without a stain or blemish on their clothing. And for anyone that has worked in food service you know this isn't an easy thing to do.  We ordered appetizers to start out the meal, crab wontons and the warm crab artichoke dip. OMG let me tell you what both of the appetizers were amazing. The crab artichoke dip was perfectly hot temp wise, seasoned perfectly and there were tons of lump crab pieces in it, came with a toasted garlic sourdough bread what a perfect combo. The crab wontons also came out a perfect temp and that pop of fresh green onion flavor combined with the sweet spicy dipping sauce was to die for.  My husband ordered the filet mignon, it came with sweet potato fries, onion rings and he added a side of steamed asparagus. I myself ordered the factory combo that came with the steak diane, shrimp scampi and their house mashed potatoes. For me the steak was tasty and cooked perfectly, the shrimp however I felt was a tad over cooked and i've had far better scampi's from other restaurants, not that it was awful, just could have been better. Now the mashed potatoes, sweet baby jesus these things were delightful, they used red potatoes and there were still nice random lumps of potato throughout which I enjoy, the seasonings they used were on point and I just couldn't stop eating them. My husband said that his filet was perfectly cooked and that his whole meal was tasty, he even proclaimed that it was one of the best filet's he's ever had.  Now for the cheesecake he ordered the lemon raspberry and I got the red velvet. Let me tell you what that red velvet cheesecake is amazing, I have an affinity for anything red velvet and am quite stringent on my standards of a good red velvet. The cake itself was moist and tasty and when surrounded by layers of cheesecake and crusted with white chocolate curls and garnished with real deal whipped cream this stuff is the business. I would go back just for the cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=420,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.8320000000000003,3.4800000000000004

We started off with an appetizer.  We got the sweet corn tamales and I was a little disappointed, bland despite all the flavors of avocado, parsley, tomato and sour cream, it just gets a two star. I ordered the shrimp tacos and the side serving of rice was so lame!  Usually I get enough to share so the serving was disappointing.

Hmmm I guess I'm not a fan of artichoke I didn't like it at all yuck which sucks because there were a lot of different appetizers that sounded tasty that i would have ordered such as avocado eggrolls, chicken pop stickers, fried Mac and cheese, tex mex eggrolls,crab wontons or the crab cakes hmm I might have to come here and just order appetizers one day lol. Now for my main dish I decided to stick with what I remember ordering and liking years ago the fettuccine Alfredo I did the lunch special since pasta is filling I ordered the tropical tea to go with it. The fettuccine was ok not great just ok I remember it being better but I guess they changed the ingredients, the tea was refreshing and delicious. My hubster and mother in law were happy with their dishes my hubster got the BBQ hamburger and she got some type of salad.  It pains me to rate it 3 stars because I'm pretty sure if I had ordered something else and a different appetizer it would of been 4 stars because the service was awesome and I just chose the wrong dish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=360,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.604,3.4000000000000004
333,Andy B.,"Windermere, FL",63,278,103.0,4.0,2012-10-14,"We have eaten at this chain countless times - probably over 50, maybe more - the prices are very very reasonable (on entrees) and the portion sizes are huge - you really should share (especially if you want to make it to dessert). Their menu is as big as their portions - it is a ring bound folio.   We have tried a lot of the dishes and it is probably easier to list those that haven't quite lived up to expectations (as that is a shorter list): The meatloaf sandwich Their brunch menu (just order from the regular menu) Our favorite dishes are the miso salmon and the bang-bang chicken & shrimp.  My sister in law ate their calamari about 20 times on a recent vacation. Their passion fruit iced tea is great and the complimentary bread basket is excellent. Our favorite cheesecakes are the dulce de leche & pumpkin (only available for about 4 weeks a year).  The strawberry shortcake is very good if you don't feel like cheesecake.

237,Shawn J.,"Henderson, NV",450,792,202.0,1.0,2012-10-24,"This Cheesecake Factory sucks. Ain't no other way to say it. Let me explain why. I pull into the parking lot and am waiting on my wife to show up as she's on her way. I call and speak to ""Frank"" who tells me the wait list is only 5 minutes. I'm only 5 spaces from the front door and can see both front doors so...I'm thinking we're going to be good to go. Well 4 min later we're walking in the door and I get told the wait is now 20 minutes. Wow, that's quite a jump in only 4 minutes and there wasn't a horde of people rushing the door. Either someone can't count or someone was lying...got a hunch the counting ability is just fine.... So we get on the list, get our pager and then cool our heels outside. And outside stinks. Literally stinks. Like has anyone emptied the trash by the benches? Finally after a 25 min wait someone comes out and calls for us by name...the pager never did go off. I got the excuse that it doesn't work outside. Hmm, I guess having equipment with a range of 100 ft from the base station is asking too much.  So we finally get seated. And service...well, it was slow. You wait for bread. You wait for drinks. You wonder if the waiter went to the bar to watch the baseball game on TV. You wonder if there will ever be peace in the Middle East. And then you get to place an order. When you finally get your food well quite frankly it sucks. My soon to be 3 year old wanted chicken strips and he wanted apple juice. He picks up the juice, starts to move the straw to his mouth and is rewarded with an apple juice shower as the lid was not snapped all the way down on the cup. Nice...now I got a soggy kid. And that soggy kid ate some of the french fries but spit out the chicken. As for my wife, she ordered Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. She ate about 5 bites before she pushed it away. And I ordered a Mexico City Chicken dish that was marginally passable, but after a couple of bites it left my mouth feeling...well it's starchy...or like it's powdery..it's just weird. 2 hours after leaving the place my wife and I still have this strange aftertaste from their food. I've never really had an aftertaste like this before. Again it's just weird.  From walking in the front door until we left took almost 2 full hours. We spent $80 and ended up leaving well over 3/4 of our food for Republic Services to send to the Apex landfill. I can write that it sucked, but quite frankly that's understating just how bad it was.  My wife said to show mercy and give 2 Stars? Not a chance. If it sucks it sucks. Call it as I experience it and be done with it. 1 Star. And when you see penquins inside the gates to Hades, you might see me darken their doors again. Until such time...oh no Boo-Boo. Ain't going back here even if you tried to drag me in.

I waited a while to write this one so I could cool off but needless to say I was not happy when I left).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=260,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.372,3.2400000000000007

The service is typically adequate to very good, but compared to the Plaza branch I'm used to in KC, MO it is missing a little bit of charm.  A few things I was very happy to see on this trip (October) were firstly a very expansive healthy menu that filled all of mine and my wife's needs and secondly a new cheesecake that was made to have hints of pumpkin pie.

325,Bradley T.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,1,,2.0,2012-11-13,"I visited this Cheese Cake Factory for a late lunch date.  My recommendation was a mistake. First we arrived at 2:30 PM and submitted our name to be told it would a 15 to 20 minute wait. I found that to be unacceptable considering the time of the day and considering that the restaruant was far from busy. We were finally setted and given a menu.  The waitress did arrive at our table in a timely manner.  We both ordered an Ice Tea as a beverage.  She returned timely.  We told her that we needed a few minutes to decide on lunch and she left, returning timely. My date ordered a Crab Cake appetizer, a Chicken Oriental Salad. I an old fashion Burger and Salad combo. My date told the waitress that the Crab Cakes were good, but the chicken in the salad was over cooked and very dry.  My burger was at best etable and the salad small.  So far, just lunch, not so good!    Then we were ask if we wanted dessert and my date ordered the Pumkin Spice Cheese Cake. It was delivered and as she ate the Cheese cake, I noticed a hair in it. I called the waitress over and she offered and it was accepted to get a new piece delivered. It was placed in a take home container.  It was never offered to take the item off the bill, which I felt should ahve been the case. I mean a hair in it? Issue number two.  We were never ask if we wanted a refill on our Ice Tea. although it was obvious that our glasses had been near empty throught out entree's.   So in a nutshell, we had a less than enjoyable dining experience and the tab? In my opinion, was to expensive. For a simple appetizer, oriental chicken salad. a burger and small-small salad, and two ice teas, came to $52.64.  then add a tradional tip of $12.00, it cost me $63.00 for a lunch!  I doubt that I will recommend or entertain another date at this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=400,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.6320000000000006,3.0400000000000005
467,Sam N.,"Las Vegas, NV",7,28,192.0,1.0,2012-11-19,"First off, I'm a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory and have been eating at different ones religiously throughout the years, but my experience at this location was a gigantic disappoint, to say the least.  When I suggested The Cheesecake Factory to one of my friends, he said that the food wasn't great and overpriced at that. Since this has always been one of my favorite places to go, of course I had to argue with him. Determined to prove him wrong, I insisted that we go here for dinner. We went in, put our name down on the wait list, and went outside for a cigarette. Now this is a normal practice, and typically restaurant hosts will always check outside for the next table to be seated if nobody answers their call from inside, especially if the waiting area inside is full! They didn't even try to look for us when we were literally standing just outside of the door (which we had also let the hostess know before stepping out), and it took a leaving customer to inform us that we were up for a table. We ended up having to sit outside because they sat somebody else at our table. Our waitress was friendly (which was the only pro of the night). I ordered a rare steak Diane and herb crusted salmon. When the food came out, my steak was COLD. Not even room temperature, but cold. When I informed our waitress, she had the audacity to tell me that in order for them to cook it rare, they could only throw it on the grill for a couple seconds which meant that it was normal for it to be cold. Are you seriously kidding me? I don't ever eat anything BUT rare steak, and I have yet gone to a restaurant and been served a cold one. Furthermore, if you don't know how the steak Diane at The Cheesecake Factory is, the steak is actually thinly sliced into little pieces, about three inches in diameter. So it doesn't take much for the meat to get heated up. As a reference, I have ordered this dish before at several other Cheesecake Factories, and not once have I encountered this problem.  At this point I was just bummed out, but my friend insisted on complaining to the manager, so that's who we asked for. It was a good 15 minutes before anybody walked past us or any of the tables around. We had to asked for a manager twice before our waitress came back with my steak re-cooked. The manager lingered in the background behind her and they both left after she gave me my steak. At this point we just asked for the check and a to-go box since our appetites were gone. I didn't even bother checking my steak to see if it was any good this time around. I didn't bother mentioning, but my herb crusted salmon was exceptionally bland. I had to season the life into it with salt and pepper myself. At least it was decently cooked, and with how they treated my steak, I didn't even want to complain about anything else. I don't remember what my date had to eat, but it's safe to say that we were just as impressed with his dish as we were with mine, which was not at all. I'm a very easy-going and forgiving person, so for me the big issue isn't necessarily the poor cooking, but the service and management (as I've seen other reviewers have pointed out). They should have just fixed the problem when it was presented, instead of making excuses. We were not being rude or unfriendly (in fact quite the opposite, despite of everything) and it's not like I was asking for the meal to be comped or discounted. In addition, I've never seen worse management skills. The manager never bothered to introduce himself or ask us how we were doing, even though we had specifically asked for him. Everything was a huge hassle and they made me feel like I was someone who was super picky or asking too much. My friend is right in that The Cheesecake Factory is a relatively pricey place to eat and based on my experience at this location, it is definitely not worth it. Worst $50 of my life, which doesn't even include tax and tip. It's a good thing our waitress was at least friendly and smiled through the night, because her other service skills were quite lacking. I don't even know how the manager was hired, because he showed no managerial skills whatsoever. I was so embarrassed that I insisted on going to eat here and defended this place when everything turned out to be horrible.  This particular Cheesecake Factory is definitely not up to par. Avoid at all costs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=460,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.6600000000000006,2.92

Like I said the place was pretty slammed, but there was never a lag in wait time, and servers never doubted themselves, something that I had a problem with on previous visits. This time our server and the runners did a great job with taking our orders, getting our drinks, food and desserts to our table in a timely manner. We were always checked on, our drinks filled. Staff was attentive, everyone was friendly. No one seemed stressed out.  Only minor issue I had was when it got dark outside, the ambient lighting in the restaurant was too low.  We were cracking up because I was not the only table using their cell phone light to read the menu. The SkinnyLicious menu was new to me and I'm lovin it!  A lot of the items are low carb or low cal most under 500 calories. I would so order their Kale Salad and the Flatbread with Pear, Blue Cheese and Arugula again. Flavors tasted really fresh and it is noted on the menu they hand make these items to order.  Hard to imagine that healthier choices can taste so good and be low enough that I can have a slice of the delish Kahlua Cocoa cheesecake (better than the Tiramisu!)  and not feel to guilty having it since Im still under my calorie intake for the day. Sweet I can have my cheesecake and eat it too!  On the other hand the burrito and the chicken dish that were also ordered in our party didn't live up to the prices they charge for this (13.95 and 16.95) ..it looked and tasted blah.

The good:  The cheesecake is delicious, and there are SO many options.  I want to try them all but usually can't pass up Reese's or Red Velvet and my husband LOVES the Snickers flavor.  And the portion is very large.  I had to bring some of mine home!  The service was friendly and efficient.  When we sat down our server immediately brought us bread, and we thanked him but told him we'd only be having dessert.  He brought our cheesecake quickly, kept our waters filled, and brought the bill promptly.  Don't you hate going somewhere for dessert and waiting like an hour to receive your bill? So glad that didn't happen!  The not-so-good:  This place is just expensive.  Seriously.  Sometimes I wonder - what right do they have to charge these prices?  It's a good chain but our cheesecake cost as much as a small dinner somewhere else!  We knew that going in so it wasn't a surprise but just be aware that cheesecake costs a small fortune here.   The lighting is very dark.  I have excellent vision and I was squinting to see the menu.  It almost made me too tired to eat cheesecake.  But I found it in me to keep going.  I can't STAND the seating.  The table you get can make or break your experience.  They have these HUGE cushy booths that they do give to parties of 2 - I saw it.  But of course we get that small 2 person table crammed between two different parties on that really long booth.  Ugh, I could hear entire conversations of the people on either side of me.  And that awkward moment when you have to turn sideways to get in or leave the booth and hope you're not brushing someone's plate with your rear end... I know I'm making kind of a big deal about this but it really is annoying to me.  Please, spread the tables out more. Overall this is a restaurant that we enjoy coming to sometimes.

I didn't want to have a large group (half kids) waiting long. I told my party to arrive at 7, I arrived about 15 min prior. Our total wait time ended up being about 25 minutes. Not too bad on a Friday night.  We were sat at a beautiful big round table where everyone could see everyone.  We ordered multiple apps and dishes including spinach dip, calamari, tex mex egg rolls, chicken picatta, garlic noodles, sliders, steak, shrimp, and more.  Everything food wise was 4 stars easy. It did take a full on hour before we were eating though. They served us basket upon basket of bread but took forever on the real food.  Service was 3 stars. Our waitress was nice, just overworked and slow.  Cheesecake selections were red velvet, Oreo, Hershey's, and strawberry.  Seriously can I say anything wrong? Of course not.  I will return to Cheesecake Factory. Overall they are a great ""chain"" restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=380,2.92,2.92,2.92,3.0200000000000005,2.92

369,Linda S.,"Henderson, NV",1687,192,645.0,4.0,2013-04-02,"It's really hard NOT to love Cheesecake Factory. This place has been an old favorite from years ago. The food is usually consistent for the most part and the portions could feed a small  village. What fluctuates seems to be service. Tonight wasn't bad as we had a newbie who had some things to learn but very polite. Funny how I sometimes expect a certain level of service at established restaurants and forget that every server has to start somewhere. After limiting myself to one slice of their signature warm brown bread, I feasted on the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. My fave! Large shrimp in a flavorful, Jamaican jerk-like sauce alongside white rice, fruity mango salsa, black beans and sweet plantains. I was a little piggy and ate all the succulent shrimp...because I could :) The sauce was plenty if you want to mix your rice into it. The other item ordered at our table that I usually get was the Crusted Chicken Romano in a creamy white Alfredo sauce (not tomato as it shows on menu...get the white, it's better) Served with pasta. Love how thin and crispy the chicken was in the Romano cheese crust. I recommend getting the sauce on the side or separating the chicken to keep it from getting soggy. We also like the frozen mango raspberry smoothie that is just like taking a bite of fresh ripe mango. Very refreshing but will fill you up. I don't recall having a bad meal here and the great part is there's something for everyone in your group and again portion sizes are big enough to share or take home for another meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=340,3.08,3.55,3.55,3.12,3.362

But this experience was excellent, mostly in part due to our waiter Joe P.  From the beginning he was excellent with giving my daughter paper to go with crayons I brought (they don't give kids any), to giving advice on what to order based on the selections I was choosing between. He was quite attentive keeping our cups full and asking if we needed anything. He even brought the cheesecake in to go boxes as we weren't eating more than a few bites!  Then the food was better than usual, not sure if choices or chef of the day but food was good. I had BBQ chicken salad which is my fave at a competing restaurant, I liked it better here! He had some kind of chicken and shrimp in a warm PB sauce (I can't remember name) and he loved it. Then I don't like cheesecake but I eat the Adams peanut butter usually, Joe reccommended the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake and it was decadent! He had red velvet as his fave!

Now there's a saying - You've been to one, you've been to them all. Quite fitting here.  The service is the same at almost all locations - pretty good. I'm not a big fan of the huge menu. I know TCF is a successful restaurant chain and the big menu is part of their schtick but sometimes you just need a restaurant to be great at a few things rather than just okay on a long list of things. Plus, the endless variety of items, makes it impossible for me to narrow things down when I have no idea what I want in the first place ----but that's probably just me. I have enjoyed their Chicken Picatta almost every visit - it's my favorite thing on the menu and it has a lunch sized-portion as well. Their cocktail menu has many great items on it as well. Not a big fan of their standard margaritas though.... All in all, if you've been to cheesecake factory before and loved it, this location is very much on par with the rest of them.

I had just moved to Las Vegas from California and have eaten at multiple Cheesecake Factory locations on many different occasions.  We decided to eat in the bar area rather than wait for a table. We sat down and our server, Melissa N., came up after a few minutes and took our drink orders but didn't ask us if we wanted to eat (we ordered 3 waters and a lemonade). She brought back our waters and walked away. We tried to flag her down for menus but she never stopped. One of us went to the host stand and got menus, 10 minutes later she came back and we placed our order and asked about the lemonade and she said she'd bring it right back and did.  While we were waiting for our food she brought us bread however she forgot bread plates and place settings. We waited for a few minutes and didn't see her so we asked another server if we could have silverware and she promptly returned with silverware, napkins, and bread plates.  Our dinner arrived via food runners and upon inspection 1 of the 3 salads had dressing and one of the sandwiches had mushrooms when we requested there were none. We waited and waited, no Melissa, so we stopped a host who was walking by if she could find her. She finally appeared and delivering another tables food and one of us had to walk after her because she never even checked on us.  She apologized for the mushrooms and said she'd have another one sent right out and also said she'd bring the dressing right back, ""I'll be right back with your balsamic"" however, I previously had asked for ranch.  It took another 10-15 minutes for someone to tell us that the sandwich was almost done. It was a manager and I asked for it to be packaged to-go because everyone was already done eating. We told him about the utter lack of service and he apologized and offered to buy us desert, we accepted. Melissa came back with the sandwich packaged to-go and asked what kind of deserts we'd like, we told her and requested no whipped cream be put on the cheesecake.  She said she'd get them packaged up for us and left the bill. The manager was kind enough to comp the meal but only comped one of the slices of cheesecake after he offered to buy it for us.  We paid the bill and Melissa returned with our cheesecakes, of course one had whipped cream. I would NEVER recommend this location to anyone strictly based on service, the food quality and portions are great but the service is absolutely dismal.

Nutrition wise, I've been trying to clean it up for the last 10+ weeks. Sometimes eating meals prepped at home can be a bit of a grind.  So, it's good to eat out every once in awhile to break up the monotony. I recently met up with the gf and a friend for lunch here. I discovered their Skinnylicious menu a couple of months ago, so I knew I'd find something clean. Just a reminder, this is a Cheesecake Factory and that means big portions.  Their Skinnylicious menu is no different.  You can get a range from salmon, turkey, lean steak, and chicken off their healthier side of the menu. But don't expect super low calories due to the portion size.  My advice, split your meal.  But for me, I'm going to be all I can be and eat all I can eat...in moderation that is.  If you do that, then expect a calorie range between 490-590.  Still...this isn't too bad. Like the rest of the Cheesecake Factories out there, there's always something for everyone.  Since I've only had something off their Skinnylicious menu at this location, I am not able to comment on the rest of their food.  I have been to other Cheesecake Factories and pretty much tried everything.

So when my coworker gave me a giftcard, we decided to treat ourselves. Upon entering the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice how busy it was. We had to yell just to hear each other. This was on a Thursday around 6:30 pm. I would hate to see how packed it gets on a Saturday. We were seated after a short wait at a part booth/ part table. My husband took the booth side, and I sat in the uncomfortable and not-so-fat-friendly chair across from him. Halfway through the dinner service I moved to the booth with my husband because my butt was going numb. It's hilarious to me to think that a restaurant that serves food like a macaroni and cheese hamburger would use chairs that only a child or Victoria Beckham could fit into. My husband ordered a burger and I ordered the chicken penne. We were surprised how huge the servings were, and ended up taking half our food home with us. Next time we will probably just share an entrée. Overall, the food was really delicious, which says a lot considering I'm generally a pretty picky eater. We ordered three cheesecake slices to go because we couldn't decide on which one we wanted to try the most. We ordered the red velvet, white chocolate raspberry, and the Reeses peanut butter cup. The Reeses we didn't care for. The red velvet was just okay. But the white chocolate raspberry was AH-MAZING. We didn't care much for our waiter. He hardly spoke to us the entire time we were there. I believe the only time he spoke was when we were ordering, which was minimal. The rest of the time he kind of just ignored us and the rest of his tables, and stood there looking at himself in a mirror or talking to the other waiters.

This place was busy, but it wasn't full to the brim. We didn't have to wait long for a table... maybe three minutes. I told the hostess that there were 2 (meaning two adults,) and one highchair. Some how, this converted to three adult menus, and no high chair. Two different ladies told me that they would bring me a high chair, before a third one brought me one.....after she finished her conversation, of course. Our waitress comes by and asks us for our drink order (2 waters with lemon.) No straws. We ask for straws while we continue to look at the HUGE menu.  Now, I don't know how Cheesecake Factory's black straws come, but ours came UNwrapped, and the waitress felt the desire to put them in our drinks for us. I hope she washed her hands. She leaves us, and we decide on what we want. Menus closed, she passes us.  Passes us, again. aannnndd again.  My mom finally flags her down. The waitress said that she wasn't ""aware"" of our readiness. *sigh* whatever. My mom has appetizers, the tuna tar tar, and the white bean hummus. I ask for the Spicy crispy chicken sandwich. I ask what type of cheese is put on the sandwich. ""Jack"". Do you have Provolone? We have cheddar, blah blah blah blah. We can do a shredded mozzarella on it for you.  OKAY, so is that a NO, that you don't have provolone? Gotcha.  We wait a decent amount of time for our food. Thank goodness for their bread and butter, which you now have to ASK for. My mom's tar tar was small. Personal appetizer small. In my opinion, not enough to share. Her hummus was just thrown in the bowl, with a piece of the flatbread already in there, getting soggy, most likely. My sandwich was nothing special. Honestly, I've had a better one, out of a box, frozen. and it cost me $1 from my grocery store. It comes out, on a ""toasted"" brioche bun. With a rather large piece of fried chicken, that looks like it is missing from a red and white striped bucket. Why this is called ""spicy"", I will never know. Even with the entire side of chipotle mayo that  came with it, it was pretty bland. Blah Meh food, and meeeeeeeeehhhh service? Not so much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=300,3.4,3.41,3.41,3.1120000000000005,3.406

It was kind of a cool evening, but the heater really helped keep us warm and the ambiance sitting outside was actually fantastic, with the music playing around the village was a nice touch!  I dont' know why I stray from my Chicken Chipotle pasta because whenever i do, i am never satisfied! I ordered the Lemon-Garlic Shrimp pasta on the Skinnylicious menu. There really isn't any sauce accompanied with this dish so I asked the server for SOME kind of sauce for this... I think she brought me out some alfredo or something. It still wasn't very good. The shrimp were quite large though but this dish just didn't do it for me.  I must just stick with my Spicy Chicken Chipotle pasta!  Hunnie Bunnie ordered her Mac n Cheese though and enjoyed it very much! And the Red Sangria hit the spot!

I didn't say anything. I know the server noticed me trying to recuse my potatoes from drowning. So she said she was leaving and Jennifer would be taking over. Well I don't think Jennifer was even there yet. 10-15 minutes go by meanwhile Christine is still taking care of the table next to us. Finally Jennifer!

Our waitress appeared to be drunk or sleepy. It was so bad we asked her to go home. She was falling asleep while taking our orders and her behavior was not the norm for CCF staff. Long story short the  orders were wrong and confused her. (Service for 6) She was replaced with another waiter and we were told she was sent home. So to make us happy we received 3 free cheesecakes and one meal free since it arrived after everyone was finish eating. I can say this was the worst service we have ever had but thank goodness the food remained at its highest quality as we would expect. I must say we did appreciate how fast the managers stepped in to make sure our dining ended on a good note.

65,Louisa M.,"Las Vegas, NV",889,1080,6699.0,3.0,2014-03-15,"I really dig this place. It presents a lively atmosphere with huge portions of food that are reasonable for the prices you pay. Don't be alarmed by the $14 cheeseburger, it's a nice portion and higher quality ingredients than your average chain restaurant. The cheesecakes are amazing, and they even have an Atkins-friendly low carb cheesecake that's made with Splenda and a crushed nut crust! It's crazy good.  Why do I frequent this restaurant? They have an understanding of special food and diet requests. I live a low carb lifestyle and it's so easy to make substitutions here. Salad, broccoli, spinach or green beans instead of fries? No problem. No bun? They'll lettuce wrap it! My new ""thing"" is to get the chicken pasta with spinach instead of pasta. Yes, the kitchen will easily accommodate special orders. It might take a lot longer to get your food (my last visit there resulted in a wait time of nearly 55 minutes from the time I placed my order 'til the food arrived), but at least the cooks get it right.  Minus a star because of three problems: 1. The usual slow service: it shouldn't take nearly an hour for food to come out of the kitchen when the restaurant is 3/4 full 2. The always dirty and gross bathrooms: Yuck, clean up more often, please! 3.

One big factor of my newfound respect is the addition of their SkinnyLicious menu. The primary reason I stopped dining with them was because of their calorie-heavy menu (they have pasta dishes that exceed 2,000 calories!). The menu features a list of items that were specially curated to not exceed 490 calories for appetizers and 590 calories for entrees and some items from their regular menu that happen to be under those thresholds. However, as I'm sure you've guessed, the portion sizes are cut dramatically. They apparently don't know how to cook filling and healthy dishes. Off their SkinnyLicious menu, I've tried the Santorini Farro Salad (farro, cucumbers, tomatoes, beets, red onions, feta cheese, tzatziki, and vinaigrette) and Chicken Samosas (crispy wrappers filled with spiced chicken with cilantro sauce). Both surprisingly delicious and not overly terrible for you. The salad was ridiculously small and there were four tiny samosas. The prices weren't bad, but it's sad considering the fact that those dishes were still loaded with calories and fat. I was surprised that their Fried Calamari (served with garlic dip and cocktail sauce) was really good. Also, I've had their Barbecue Ranch Chicken Salad (grilled chicken, avocado, tomato, grilled corn, black beans, cucumber, and Romaine) with the dressing on the side. It was tasty and it was such a large portion that I couldn't finish it. The SkinnyLicious menu is great, however, it's really hard to love a place that serves dishes that have more calories than you should consume in a day. It's a shame that a lot of diners are really oblivious to restaurants' nutrition information and obviously, restaurants don't want to be transparent about it. So, although I don't advocate dining at these restaurants, if you do, as I'm sure I will in the future (even though I won't want to), definitely order off the SkinnyLicious menu. Side note: their Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake (seasonal) and many other cheesecakes are really good.

Tonight I ordered the fried cheese starter platter, soup du jour (tortilla), and the Chicken and Biscuit entree. Let me start off but saying the fried cheese was excellent, about 8 little triangles perfectly breaded and crisped with Gouda and Mozzarella cheeses and melted to perfection. They were the perfect temperature. The soup was so-so, a basic bisque like consistency with corn and some other veggies. It had a nice spicy finish but at first bite the saltiness is a little  overwhelming. The entree is one of my favorite a good solid buttermilk biscuit, very flaky and buttery, with a vegetable melange (carrots were slightly undercooked) , mushrooms, and peas. The chicken however was moist and juicy, pan seared to perfection. It also had just the right amount of rosemary crust. And the gravy that they use is fantastic, not to rich or thick, and not overly seasoned. That's what I like about this entree it's not overly done so you can really enjoy each component.

It's garlicky and has a bit of a kick to it. So good. You can purchase a jar to go, FYI. My other half had the pasta carbonara with chicken and he really liked it. Others in our party had bbq chicken pizza, fettuccine alfredo, corn dogs and a club sandwich. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals.  Now you can't go to CCF and not order cheesecake. I spent another 20 mins deciding which flavor I wanted. I finally chose the oreo and it was amazing. I also got to sample the smores, reeses, and banana cream pie cheesecakes. They were all pretty good. The reeses has an over powering peanut butter flavor which I didn't really care for. The smores one was really good and the banana cream was good as well.

Food Fart-my term for when you are hungry, but you can't decide even with the HUNDREDS of dining options and cuisines in the 702 AND the Yelp App where you want to grab a bite to eat???? Anyone else run into this problem?  Anywho, we were on this side of town and we didn't care for anywhere on the strip(don't think anyone who works on the Strip cares either)and we were Chinatown'd out (also a famous area for Dirty Dining lately...looking at you, Joyful House!) Prices are very reasonable here and the portions are HUMANGOUS which is why I like to order off their Small Plates Menu and I always get the Pear, Bleu Cheese,  and Pecan Flatbread which has always been consistently good. I also got the Veggie Fries Combo which came with Portabellos, Zucchini, and Avocados. The avocados were my least favorite because they have no business being in the fryer IMO. These are one of those things that are great as-is. Totally stuffed from dinner, we had no room for dessert, but we were pleased with our meal.  This is the first time though that our server kinda sucked. She just looked like she didn't want to be there...lucky we didn't let her ruin our visit. Next time you find yourself having a food fart, Cheesecake Factory may just be a good option!   ALOHA!!!!

279,Oona W.,"Henderson, NV",817,97,1493.0,4.0,2014-11-21,"This particular location brings back the first time I ate here: I am down with the swirl, have jungle fever, a checkerboard chick, and all other silly names people come up with to express that they are open to all types of races. I love all guys--black, white, Asian, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, European, tall, short, skinny, heavy, muscular, etc. I have no specific type. If you're hot, you're hot! RIGHT? So, one of my friends started this interracial meetup group and at the time I was NOT interested in dating. I am happiest being a loner. She talked me into accompanying her to the Cheescake Factory with the rest of the group that signed up. Now, I have enough common sense that groups like this rarely turn out the way you want because for one thing people in their 30s just don't sign up for stuff like that.  This was a Monday evening (happy hour) and it was fairly crowded. We were waiting for the RSVP's to show up and it was starting to crowd. While waiting a few males showed up and I could tell they were NOT her type. She was looking extremely irritated and I was having a blast, watching it all go down. LOL.... This man in his late 40's showed up and without any kind of greeting she jumped up from her seat and said, ""How old are you?!"" After he reluctantly said 47, she made it clear that this group was for no one over 40. I felt bad for him as he walked away and I secretly hoped he didn't return to shoot up the restaurant. Another male approached us wearing coke bottle glasses, a striped stained polo shirt, dirty, baggy bum jeans, and velcro snapper shoes. He looked just like Robin Williams in ""ONE HOUR PHOTO."" To make matters worse, he was hoarding several overused Walmart bags full of personal property! Maybe he thought he was gonna get lucky and have a place to stay tonight?! She tried to eliminate him by asking his age. He was a smart man, and he lied. Haha.....  Out of no where, I could see her hopes rising when two extrememly tall white males entered the restaurant. The kind of lads you see posing in an Abercrombie ad. She jumped up immediately and said, ""Are you here for the meetup group?!"" They looked surprised and said no. She slumped down like she had just completely given up. Inside, I was cracking up!  The happy hour menu is extremely cheap, nearly half off so I ordered a few appetizers. I got the calamari which is lightly breaded and extremely tender and juicy. It comes with 2 different dipping sauces, but the calamari is so good it can stand on its own with a little lemon juice. I like ordering off of their SKINNYLICIOUS menu which are items that are healthy and less calorie. The Arugula Salad containing Arugula, Marcona Almonds, Golden Raisins, Parmesan, Lemon and Olive Oil.....is sooooooo light and refreshing and is a great accompaniment to something that is fried.  So I sat there, watching some people make a connection and others look like they were ready to go. I chose to sit in a nuetral seat, meaning I sat between two females so that no one assumed I wanted to pair up. I wasn't there for a love connection--just a really yummy meal. This evening turned out to be hilarious--at my friends' expense. She didn't find anyone that fit her type.  Oh well! I left with a delicious OREO COOKIE CHEESECAKE!

I hate restaurants that are so loud that I can't talk to the person sitting in front or next to me. Plus the tables are way to close together so it feels like I am sitting with strangers.

After we were seated we were greeted by our sever who unfortunately was about to leave for the day. She introduced Deanna as our new server while she made sure we had plenty to drink before she left. Deanna proceeded to take our food order and was very vocal when our friends ordered the crispy chicken sandwich with an extra order of fries. They told her that they were sharing the sandwich to which Deanna replied loudly ""that's it ? You're sharing a sandwich?"" She seemed irritated and it continued when my husband and I ordered the crusted chicken romano with a salad to share. She commented again ""you're sharing too?"" Then to cap it off when our friend's 5 year old told her father that she wasn't hungry she stated ""so she isn't eating anything!""  Honestly, I found her behavior apalling and I have no problem taking my business to Lucille's and/or Claim Jumpers which are both just across the street.

259,Teri W.,"Henderson, NV",134,833,390.0,3.0,2015-02-25,"We had dinner at Settebello recently and nothing on their dessert menu interested us. So we decided to walk over to Cheesecake factor to share some cheesecake. It was a Saturday night and the place was jammin. Although, it seemed as if maybe they were short staffed, because at least 1/2 the restaurant was empty, but we had to wait to be seated (along with 3 or 4 other parties in front of us). Once we were seated, it took between 10-15 minutes for our server to approach the table. This wasn't a big deal, because we had already eaten and it gave us time to decide on what slices to order. But if I were hungry, I would have become hangry real quick. We decided to order 3 slices (all cheesecake): Banana cream, key lime and Kahlua Cocoa.  Our server returned a short while later and let us know that they were out of the banana cream and key lime, which were the 2 we really were excited to try.  We were pretty disappointed and I wish he would've known this when we ordered originally. We then decided on the mango key lime and lemon meringue instead. Now, it has been quite a long time (at least a few years) since I have been to Cheesecake Factory. They have a very large menu, and not many places can pull that off. However, the service was painstakingly slow.  We shouldn't be there more than an hour when we just ordered coffee/water and dessert. Although our service was very nice, I just didn't expect to be there as long as we were. It probably took 20-30 minutes just to get our order.  I mean, come on! For 3 slices of cheesecake, which is obviously pre-made? A bit ridiculous. Everything was really tasty, even if it was basically not what we originally wanted. We each had a different favorite - I actually quite liked the lemon meringue, which is not what I thought my favorite would be. The Kahlua Cocoa was really rich, but good as well. The mango key lime was probably my least favorite - I thought the mango over powered the key lime, but it wasn't bad by any means. The prices were reasonable. Our check was $28 for the slices and drinks (1 coffee). Overall, I remembered why I hadn't been in so long, since there are SO many other options in the area. But I would definitely go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=140,2.92,3.44,3.44,3.0840000000000005,3.232

301,Stephanie M.,"Albany, NY",3,12,1.0,2.0,2015-03-14,"My husband and I had lunch at this location today (a Saturday afternoon).  There was a short wait of about 10-15 minutes.  We were seated in the bar area.  It took our waitress a little while to come to our table, but I hate being rushed so I didn't mind.  Our server was very nice and courteous, and definitely the highlight of the meal.   My menu pages were greasy inside, like someone had butter on their hands and then touched the menu.  Gross.  Note to hostess desk - clean your menus! For an appetizer, the fried calamari was good, but a little too greasy.  For an entree, I ordered fish tacos, tortillas were very greasy and I had to send the dish back.  The second time they forgot to hold the cream, so I had to send my dish back again.  Coming from Los Angeles, I eat fish tacos all the time but these were just very bland.  I make them better at home.  I've had these before at another location and they were great, which is why I chose to order them.  By the time I finally got my food, I was already full from the appetizer and bread, so I just took them home.  If I knew I was taking a dish to go, fish tacos would be my last choice, since tortillas are obviously going to get soggy. My husband had to send his fettucine alfredo back because the pasta was all clumped together.  It's like they overcooked it, then left it sitting without the sauce so it all stuck together.  For $19 for pasta and chicken, that's just ridiculous.  The kitchen staff needs to raise their standards for the prices they charge.     I've never had a problem at other Cheesecake Factory locations, but this one was definitely sub-par, with the exception of our waitress.  She was terrific.  Overall, an experience I wouldn't want to repeat.  I'll probably stay away from Cheesecake Factory for awhile.  Waste of money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=320,3.28,3.46,3.46,2.7280000000000006,3.3880000000000003

451,Angel L.,"Henderson, NV",1,17,,2.0,2015-04-02,"I want to start out by saying I LOVE the cheesecake factory. I would give the one in Anaheim, CA (in the Gardenwalk) 5 stars. With that said, I give this specific establishment 2 stars. The service is a hit or miss. Sometimes you will get a server that is right on point but most the time the servers are ""ok."" The food gets screwed up at this place on a regular basis. One of the mess ups out of many was burned French fries. At an establishment like this I expect high standards. First off the cook was a jerk for even putting it out there to be served. Second the waitress failed by bringing it to us after clearly seeing that it was burned. We had to tell her they were burned (it was obvious) and she didn't even apologize or seem sympathetic she just said ok i'll get you another one, in a quick fast tone. If you alter a dish, they will bring it to you wrong. And i'm not talking about an extreme alteration. I'm talking about asking for a different type of pasta vs. the one it comes with. If they mess up your dish it will come back more screwed up as if to punish you for having the audacity to correct the mistake. Take out is always a guarantee mess up and they always give you less food when you do take out vs. when you sit inside. I am speaking from 3 years of experience with this place. If you can, go to the one in Summerlin they are much better and more on target. its really sad that such an awesome establishment is screwed up and nothing is done to rectify it. I'm not going to list all the messed up incidents from this place because it will turn into a novel. Its a great food chain with wonderful food. There is something for everyone here and you will not be disappointed with the taste of your food, when made properly. I know a lot of flack is given to this place for the high fat and calorie content. I really don't think that people are looking at it from the proper perspective. You need to know they give you huge portions here. The fat and calorie content is based on the huge plate of food you receive. This place is giving you all this food with the intent of being able to have the consumer bring some home for later. You cant possible think that you are supposed to eat all that food in one sitting. The food you get on your plate is way more then what you would get on the appetizer plate. Appetizers are meant to serve 2-4 people and your entrée contains more food then that. So I will leave you with that food for thought ;). If you eat the proper portion its really not that bad in fat and calories. Have you ever seen the fat and calories in a marie calendars frozen meal at the grocery store?! Just think, the portion in a Marie Calendar's frozen meal is 1/3 to 1/4 less then what you would receive on your plate at The Cheesecake factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=440,3.4,3.41,3.41,2.8560000000000003,3.406

I received my salad and 3 bites in I found a BUG in my salad. I was shocked and disgusted. The waiter was shocked as well and took my salad. About 5 minutes later the manager came over and gave me a fake smile and apology that was very procedural. She offered me something else but why on earth would I want anything else from this place. I am very limited as to what I eat and this was one of the only options for me. I sure didn't want another salad with BUGS in it. Yes, I get it- it's lettuce and bugs like lettuce but they should be washing their lettuce more thoroughly to avoid this disgusting situation. I had to sit the rest of the meal while others in the party ate their meals which were not salad. As a person in customer service, the manager did not go out of her way to rectify the situation. She could have offered a discount on the rest of the bill. She took the salad off the bill but of course she would, I did not eat it and this was their fault. When we left the same manager was standing near the exit and she turned her back when she saw us leaving. Did not say another word to us. This is horrible customer service at it's finest. I will not ever go back to this place and urge others to be aware of the BUGS in the salad. To all the restaurants out there, when it is your fault someone's meal goes terribly wrong it is your responsibility to make things right.

It's definitely a multipurpose restaurant. The staff is beyond friendly and the vibe of the restaurant is really relaxing.  The one thing I'd be aware of is the wait.

338,Thomas H.,"Colorado City, TX",45,99,11.0,2.0,2015-06-14,You know for a place that charges as much as they do you would figure they could at least come out with some really good entrees. I mean I'll give it to them on the chicken pot stickers fairly tasty item but it wasn't any better than day a ghengis grill where it costs half as much right? My gf got the skinny Asian chicken which she wasn't very impressed by at all and for something on a low cal memo the peon was ridiculous but I digress. My option was the Baja chicken tacos with rice and beans again I wouldn't mind the price of the meal was worth it but the tacos and rice had no flavor and the only hot sauce the carried was Tabasco which is awful on a taco. So needles to say we were both looking for a dessert to really pull the meal together and is the cheese cake factory so hell why not we ordered an oreo cheese cake and I was really excited for it to come only to be let down I wanted to give this place one star but our server was great and very attentive so I the an extra one in for him.

344,Foodie F.,"Anthem, Las Vegas, NV",1,37,16.0,4.0,2015-06-20,"I had a great experience coming here. It's such a casual restaurant that also has its own elegant flair and atmosphere.  Our waitress was very kind and helpful. I don't remember her name, but she always checked on us and was very patient with us when we couldn't decide on what to eat. The food was definitely delicious. I'm usually not fond of the entrées when I come here because 1) they're supersized and when I use them as ""leftovers"", they get soggy and I can't eat them anyway, and 2) they're usually not the best tasting even at the restaurant. However, I decided to order only small plates / appetizers to satisfy myself.  I ordered the crispy crab bites, which were decadent and had a lightly battered outside. The presentation was nice. It comes with six bites in a small skillet dish and a side of sauce and a lemon. I shared the fresh basil, tomato and mozarella flatbread with my friend. She got the beet and goat cheese salad. Overall, we finished all of the food and we were still satisfied. The appetizers, in my opinion, taste 10000x better than the entrées.  Now for the good stuff...the cheesecake. After several minutes of skimming through the endless list of various cheesecakes, I finally decided to go with Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake, which, in the words of the Cheesecake Factory gods, it is ""Layers of Moist Chocolate Cake, Chewy Brownie, Toasted Coconut-Pecan Frosting and Creamy Chocolate Chip Coconut Cheesecake."" Ohhhhh yes... My lovely waitress put this in a to-go box for me, and it was fresh the whole time I ate it. It was super sweet (which I love) and the coconut paired perfectly with the decadently rich chocolate and toasted pecans. And to top it all off, the brownie and cheesecake-y cream in the center made this cheesecake - eating experience all the more better for me. I'm definitely coming here again, but this time, for the cheesecake only.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=240,3.12,3.38,3.464,3.088,3.2760000000000007

This was served with buttered pieces of toast. The dip was just drowning in oils and grease. It was like dipping grease into grease, not very good in my opinion. For our main corse I ordered the chicken madeira. For being the most famous dish, it was not really what I had my expectations set for. It was a great dish none the less and was prepaired flawlessly. The chef plated it very beautifully aswell.  My fiancé ordered the steak Diane and shrimp scampi combination. Again the presentation was very beautiful and the only critic she had was that the scampi was a bit tangy for her taste.

This location is always busy. I highly recommend to get there early if you have big groups. We were only four people and waited 10-20 minutes. You have the option of sitting inside, outside, or whatever is first available. We chose to sit inside. Once seated, our server, Nathan, came by with waters and bread. The bread basket consisted of sourdough bread, a wheat bread, and white bread. I ordered a raspberry lemonade and it was pretty good. I definitely like the strawberry one better but it's not bad if you want to try something new. My family and I ordered the avocado egg rolls as our appetizer being that it's our favorite whenever we come. It was perfectly fried and the avocados inside were delicious and ripe. I chose to order a new dish tonight so I went for the farfalle pasta with chicken and roasted garlic. I'm a huge fan of bow tie pasta so I had to try it. Once I received it though I was a bit underwhelmed. The pasta was cooked perfectly but the chicken was okay. They also left huge chunks of garlic in the pasta so if you're not a garlic fan, ask for it without it. The pasta wasn't horrible but it definitely wasn't the best I've had there. I feel like I've had better farfalle at other restaurants. Besides the pasta, everything relate else was great.   We ordered dessert to go (red velvet cheesecake and cherry cheesecake). Red velvet is THE best! It's part cake and part cheesecake--perfect combo!  Our server Nathan was awesome and made sure we were always taken care of during dinner.

We waited half an hour-even after people who came after us already got their food and left. When we arrived home I pulled the food out and realized they had forgotten to put my cheesecake in the bag. I called and she asked if I wanted to come in for it and I declined. She didn't offer to do anything to fix the issue besides refund the money to my gift card.

First off, we got our bread we only got the sourdough. I know, for someone who comes here often, That were supposed to get both wheat and sourdough. We had to chase someone to get us wheat bread since that's the only bread I eat.  Then we finally ordered. Good thing we got there before it got busy. As it was getting busy, we saw each table getting sat. We patiently waited for our food that took ALMOST 30 MINUTES without the server even telling us that our food is coming up or updating us or whatever. We saw the table over (who got there about 7 minutes after us) get their food first!!!!!!!  Then upon getting boxes, our server goes, ""okay KIDS can I get you anything else"". That's soooooo rude! I don't go to a restaurant saying ""okay GRANDMA this is what I want"" to my server. So since I was a ""kid"" we tipped like we were ""kids"". Maybe that's why we didn't get the service we deserved cause we were ""kids""  NEVER COMING BACK TO THIS LOCATION AGAIN! I would rather spend my money somewhere else!

Other times the food is horrible and the service is up to par. Then there are those time where neither can make up for the other. In the last two times I went here I ordered the Diane steak and most recently the Margarita pizza (spelling).  The Diane steak was super salty that I barely nibbled it. It also took about 1 hour for our food to get to our table, but the server and the manager was very apologetic. The latest time I was here was for my best friend's birthday. The pizza was okay. It was a little drier than I'm used to, but it was fresh. The wait to from order was quick, bit the server was not up to par. We also had mentioned at several occasions that it was her birthday and the server also checked for her ID when she ordered her drink. In all honesty, it was the main reason we came here so we, plus the servers, could make her feel special on her birthday by singing her happy birthday -- but alas, our server did not do it and we left very unhappy.

This location is conveniently located inside The District. It's on the opposite side from most of the shopping so parking is easy. Just like most of their locations they have an enormous amount of seating and outdoor seating as well. The patio is a nice option when the weather is nice. The menu has a large amount of options and a large variety of options as well. There should be something here to please everyone. I like that a group could come in and order completely different foods. Surprisingly, everything I've had is really good. They are one of the few places that can pull off a large menu without sacrificing taste. The portions are always big enough to make into two meals. I love fun lunch leftovers. This is one of the few restaurants that make it easy for someone on a diet if you aren't looking to treat yourself. The Skinnylicious menu has some great options and the calories are listed on the menu. They couldn't make it easier for someone counting calories. The cheesecake lives up to the hype and just like the regular menu there are a ridiculous amount of options. My favorite is the Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake.  Pricing is reasonable for the portion sizes. As I mentioned, most entrees are big enough to be two or three servings for the average person.

We had the portobello mushroom, garlic, ginger wraps. So amazing. Mushrooms sautéed to perfection. My boyfriend was very happy with the start of our meal.  We had the steak with medallions off this skinnylicious menu and we also had the chicken Alfredo.  The steak on our plate was amazing. Mashed potatoes with asparagus, roasted tomatoes, and steak medallions all layered on top made a perfect combo. Steak was cooked medium rare as requested. Juicy chicken and perfect al dente noodles mixed with the amazing flavor of the Alfredo sauce.  So happy. I also ordered a strawberry daiquiri. It was blended all the way through with no ice in the bottom like I experience from most places. Deliciously fresh flavor with just a hint of rum.  We had a slice of caramel cheese cake to finish it all off. Dinner was amazing. Great date night. Boyfriend was happy.

117,Arthur M.,"Henderson, NV",103,451,1748.0,3.0,2016-06-09,"We usually make it here at least a couple of times a year. This time, we were influenced by $50 in gift cards to dine on a Wednesday night around 7:30. Our party of seven waited about 15 minutes outside before we were greeted by our server who was kind enough to come outside and lead us inside to our table. The menu can be overwelming with endless choices. But that is good for our group which has a pretty wide spectrum of preferences. There hasn't been too many changes to the menu over the years with the small plates and Skinnylicious options being the most recent to me. For the rookies, don't go hog wild on the bread, because you won't be able to finish your three-serving portion entree. Our order was pretty varied which included two entree salads, three sandwiches, a pasta dish, and the filet medallion off the Skinnylicious menu for me. There was plenty of ""filler"" vegetables and not a lot of beef for my entree as expected, but the vegetables were cooked and seasoned well. The pasta dishes have never really impressed me, but the salads are surprisingly good. If I don't get a steak dish, I'll usually get the tuna tataki salad which is a very flavorful salad. Everyone was happy with their meals with over half us needing take out boxes. We finished with two pieces of cheesecake. Over time, I've found that I prefer cheesecakes without any cake mixed in like the fresh strawberry, banana cream, and salted caramel. I do have to comment on our server who left a good first impression by greeting us outside, but everything else really wasn't up to par. To add to the rehearsed, corny jokes where the response was crickets chirping after each one, he had no organization of our orders. Stating that I was seat 1 when taking drink orders and my daughter was seat 7 sitting across from me at the end of the table, he had no clue who drank what when he brought the drinks out, auctioning each one and running back and forth across the table. He forgot my mother and wife's glasses of wine, didn't notice they were without beverage after three return trips to the table, and he had to be reminded by me to grab them at the bar after 15 minutes. Then he did the always annoying checking every three minutes if I had signed the receipt after he ran my credit card. Which meant he was cut and wanting to bolt, but you don't want to perturb the person that is signing off on your tip. Before gift cards were discounted, our check was a reasonable $163. What you'll get with Cheesecake Factory, as you will with other successful chains, is consistency. They need that consistency to handle the amount of volume that comes through the doors. The food and atmosphere in this location are also consistent with every other restaurant. The changing variable is the service, which is usually a hit. It comes down to whether you think that consistency is good, and I would tend to agree with most Yelpers that it is A-OK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=60,3.76,3.47,3.46,2.9240000000000004,3.5860000000000003

We pull up and everyone's waiting to get seated. A whole bunch of parties ahead of us, but there were only 2 of us so the wait was about 30 minutes. Not bad. We waited. Got seated. On a tiny tiny table. Our server was quick and attentive. His name was Sayem or Sam I think? I'm not too sure but he's indian. I think..... Anyway, good thing we shared appetizers! We got four different plates. A house salad with mixed greens, cucumber, tomatoes, and balsamic vinaigrette. Fried Mac 'N Cheese balls--macaroni put into a ball, deep fried, with creamy marinara and parmesan cheese sauce. Fried calamari (self explanatory)--however it's paired with cocktail sauce (I prefer marinara). Buffalo blasts-- chicken marinated in buffalo sauce wrapped in a wonton and deep fried.

We were here at around 11am, and I had already decided on getting breakfast. Of course, on display as you walk in are all of their amazing looking cheesecakes. I was 'this' close to just saying 'forget the breakfast, bring on the cheesecake!!!'. Our waiter was awesome, and very professional. He was not wearing a nametag, but he must be the tallest guy there. I ordered an Eggs Benedict with regular bacon, as I always do, and my husband go the Spicy Chicken Sandwich. What I loved about both of these is that the condiments were in small bowls on the plates, rather than dealing with messy ketchup bottles. The lettuce and tomato for the sandwich were off to the side, so they stayed nice and cold. Nice touch. My bacon was not super crispy, but overall the benedict was pretty good.  We had no room for a cheesecake, but saw the monstrosity that the couple next to us got. It was enormous!!! But they finished it. Ha ha.

41,Tara J.,"Las Vegas, NV",26,101,40.0,1.0,2016-07-30,"I've eaten at this Cheesecake Factory location many times and have never had an issue with the service or food previously. However, I had an awful experience today that warrants a one star rating.  In honor of national cheesecake day, the Cheesecake Factory is offering half price cheesecake. What a deal! And it is. But who knew that you'd have to deal with snotty, rude and unprofessional employees in order to get your piece of the pie, or cheesecake, in this instance?  So I go in and it's busy. Like really, really busy. And of course it is! The best cheesecake on planet earth is half off! I go right to the counter line and after waiting for about 5 minutes (which was actually quicker than I thought it would be considering how busy they were) I got to the counter and get not so much as a hello, hi, what can I get for you? Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Just a girl staring at me waiting for me to place my order. Ok-they're busy and she's probably stressed. I get that. No biggie.  I requested 4 pieces of cheesecake - 2 Reece's, 1 snickers and 1 salted caramel. Alas, I was informed that it's only 1 piece half off per person. Since I'm there by myself, I'm basically only able to get 1 piece at the discount and the rest will be full price. No problem - it makes sense to put a cap on it so that people don't go crazy. I decide that I don't want to pay full price for 3 pieces and adjust my order to remove the salted caramel and just ordered 2 Reece's and 1 snickers.  I pay and even leave a small tip ($3) in the tip cup. I walk away from the counter and a couple minutes later she calls me back to get my cheesecake. I look in the bag and unfortunately there's 1 Reece's, 1 snickers and 1 salted caramel. NOT what I'd ordered, paid and even TIPPED for! This, my cheesecake loving friends, is how the rest of my visit went - verbatim: Me: Oh shoot, I didn't want the salted caramel. That was the one I cancelled.  Her: So what do you want then? Me: 2 Reece's and 1 snickers. I'm sorry.  * At this point she ROLLS HER EYES and SHAKES HER HEAD, takes out the salted caramel and walks away. I am so disappointed and feel like I'm putting her out when in all actuality, it was HER that made the mistake and ME that was being apologetic about it. Huh? * Me: (out loud and to no one in particular) Not sure what that attitude is all about.  The manager is standing there and overheard my comment and this is how the remainder of my visit went, again verbatim: Manager: Well you know what it is, ma'am? We're not even supposed to be doing this.  Me: You're not supposed to be doing what? Manager: Giving half price for take out orders. We're actually only supposed to be honoring it for dine in customers.  Me: Well I certainly appreciate that you're honoring it but I don't think the attitude that comes along with it is necessary.  And at that point I got my CORRECT cheesecake and walked out.  It's unfortunate that the manager chose to defend his employee ROLLING HER EYES and SHAKING HER HEAD at me rather than apologize for her completely unprofessional and unjustified behavior. Like I said, I get that they're busy. I understand that it's a stressful job. And I definitely appreciate that they honored the discounted price when, apparently, they didn't have to. But as a customer, I should not be treated that way, especially when the mistake wasn't mine and I was kind and gracious even when she made the mistake.  Shame on this employee and shame on this manager (both whose names I didn't get, dang it).

The Cheesecake Factory is my FAVORITE restaurant, I am always at the location in Los Angeles which is where I'm from.  Since it was a Friday night it was about a 30-minute wait and I got there around 6:15 PM. There were a lot of parties waiting - for graduations, and also it's Father's Day weekend. The 30 minutes went by quick though, as I was looking through the menu and picking out a cheesecake to order for dessert in their display. 30 minutes is such a nice waiting time, and didn't seem that long especially because the one I go to in LA has a wait time that goes almost 2 hours! It's crazy.  I ordered a strawberry lemonade with a Chicken Marsala with Mushrooms - it was in a wine sauce with bow tie pasta around it! It was delicious and I loved the plating. My uncle got the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta with shrimp and chicken and it was so yummy. Not too spicy at all! We also ordered the carrot cake cheesecake. I liked it. I've tried almost every cheesecake and this just crosses it off my list! Took two bites and had to take it to go because I was too full.  Our waiter Brittany was very attentive and nice and checked up on us! Definitely a plus when waiters/waitresses come and check on us every so often rather than waiting for one to come by.

We were told the wait for a table would be 45-50 minutes, but we're not seated until over an hour and twenty minutes elapsed. The worst part was that it was clear that the restaurant was not properly staffed for a Saturday night. They had an entire section of tables empty while the lobby was full of people waiting.  We suspect that the kitchen was understaffed because f he amount of time it took to get food out.

And that poor side salad - looks like a bagged salad mix of baby greens and other lettuces that came to me looking like the dressing had been poured on it and it had sat awhile,   it was completely wilted and limp.  Very unappetizing.

I was seated after waiting a while which I didn't fully mind.  I would have been fine sitting at the bar if it got me seated sooner but I had a nice table to myself when I was seated.  My serve came over right away and brought my bread and water out pretty quickly.  For my lunch I ordered the lunch size pasta DiVinci.  Afterall, it has MUSHROOMS!  It also has grilled onions, chicken and sauce.  I asked for some fresh grated cheese to top it.  This was not a bad bowl of pasta but it could have been better.  The pasta to chicken ratio seemed off.  The mushrooms were good.  The onion tasted burnt.  And there seemed to be a taste of burnt oil too.  It wasn't terribly off putting but it was noticeable.  The dish has a lot of potential but I think the kitchen was bitten by the mass crowds and suffered for it.  Regardelss, I saved some for later and also asked to have my left over bread packaged to-go.  This was a late lunch/early dinner.  I knew I would be hungry again before bed time.  So asking for a doggie bag was my way of planning ahead.  I also wanted to save room for the cheesecake that brought me in in the first place. For dessert, I ordered a slice of tiramisu cheesecake.  That combines two of my favorite desserts into one delectable sin on a plate.  Coffee soaked lady fingers for a crust, soft and fluffy cheesecake filling, a dusting of cocoa powder, and a dollup of chocolate whipped cream made this one delicious way to end my afternoon.  I'd order that in a heartbeat (possibly my last heartbeat at the rate I'm going with these dishes).  But there are so many other options to try.  This is the Cheesecake Factory, you know.  What kind of place would it be if it didn't have too many cheesecake options?  All the more reason to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=40,3.84,3.72,3.54,3.404,3.7680000000000002

140,Isaac D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,11,2.0,5.0,2017-08-11,"This Cheesecake Factory is in a great location right off of the 215 and Green Valley. Lots of available parking, comparatively speaking to the Summerlin location at Boca Park. We arrived at 6:30pm this Friday night and waited for about 30 minutes. Even though it was really busy, none of the servers seemed to be running around with no remorse for guests who were waiting in the lobby/hostess area. I've been to Cheesecake Factory's in the past where this has happened. After we sat down we were greeted by our waitress Andrea R. Very knowledgeable, very friendly and patient. DEFINITELY, three important qualities needed for working here as a server.  We started with avocado egg rolls and buffalo blasts. Avocado egg rolls, as always were fantastic. Buffalo blasts were great as well, however it seems there's a little too much extra breading around the outside. I'm sure for the cooking style it's beneficial, and they are still very delicious otherwise and definitely a sufficient enough portion.  Since the dishes are so plentiful, I chose to order an additional appetizer, the Crabcakes. They were fantastic (even though I only enjoyed one of the three) and served fairly well. The only adjustment to this dish I would make is how the Crabcakes are served. They are presented on a bed of Chinese noodles (little foam type noodles). As you cut through the Crabcakes the noodles stick to the Crabcake and it changes the consistency of the bite. The crabcake itself was DELICIOUS. But, it would have been far better if I didn't have to fight noodles through every bite!  After dinner I had the Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Cup Ripple Cheesecake and it is wonderful. Not too sweet, very satisfying if you're a chocolate lover.  The service here is excellent, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere like any Cheesecake Factory is comfortable. I will come back here again and I would recommend any one else too as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=40,3.6,3.69,3.524,3.7960000000000003,3.6540000000000004

The menu at The Cheesecake Factory is very extensive, a bit overwhelming at that! With the menu consisting of just about 20 pages, everyone is bound to find something they'll enjoy. The food is consistent, always fresh, and the portions are ridiculously huge. I always have leftovers for lunch the next day! A few of my favorite dishes include the Barbeque Ranch Chicken Salad and the Crispy Chicken Costoletta.  If you have room, there are over 50 cheesecakes and various desserts to choose from! We normally come to an agreement (which can be hard) and share a slice! Seriously, after a meal here, a slice of cheesecake will push you to the edge. During our most recent visit, we received the most outstanding service from Aiden! He was on his A-game from start to finish, exceptional to say the least. He was very informative when we had questions about items on the menu and even recommended a few of his favorites! Aiden was constantly checking up on my family and always made sure that our waters (and bread basket) were filled. Not to mention, he can really carry a tune! We were very impressed! Thank you, Aiden! Now, if only it wasn't so dark inside the restaurant! The ambience is nice, don't get me wrong, but I wish the lighting wasn't so dim! There was a single light shining down from the high ceiling in the middle of our table, and everyone was taking turns using it to read the menu. I know, it sounds ridiculous, but it's true.

If you're going to visit a restaurant that more than lives up to its reputation for dietary madness, go on an unrestricted night, because it's stupidly futile to observe gustatory rigor at The Caloriecake Factory. Their well-honed formula will suck dollars from your wallet and pack pounds on your waist.  And it is a successful formula, at least as best I can tell: each dish is savory and well prepared if not totally inspired, and most spill over the sides of large plates. Gracious, competent staff, expensive drinks, and no room for dessert, which you will order anyway.  Chicken Madeira: Heavy and comfortish, with nicely cooked chicken breast slathered in peas, carrots, heavy cream/chicken/cheese sauce, stacked on top of a George Foreman fist sized serving of creamy potatoes. Because this setup is too low carb, Caloriecake adds two standard sized buttery biscuits on top of all this, which is good because I totally didn't get enough bread before the meal. With butter. And beer.  Total calorie weigh-in: 1650 for just the dish alone.  Bacon-bacon burger: perfect sear over hot pink beef. Soft, sweetish french roll, fresh crispy veggies, and a joyfully disgusting amount of cheddar cheese and mayo. Man, what a good burger! Alas, sidekicked by fries with a sadly low crunch halflife. The fries could be better.  Calories: 1500. This is so much naughty fun that it'll come with a hangover.  Caramel Salted Cheesecake: 1000 calories for one slice. I'm laughing as I type this.  Back on program tomorrow. The Caloriecake Factory adds just enough pleasure to your guilty to keep busting diets like belts. Go enjoy.

They quickly sat us at a booth, which was nice and we appreciated that accommodation. 5 minutes later our server D shows up to take our drink order, she grabs our drinks quickly, sets them down, and rushes away. We had in mind an appetizer we wanted to order and that would have been a great time to order however she didn't stop at the table for even a second for us to do that. Another 5-7 minutes later she shows up once more and asks us if we are set to order. As we order she seems rushed, and quickly leaves our table once again. After our appetizer gets to the table brought by I assume a runner she never once came by to ask if we need anything. Here and there she would grab our drinks to refill without asking and wouldn't say a word, never spending even a second at the table to give us a chance to ask for anything. Once our food arrived the runner put our food down and ran off before asking if we needed anything else before I could process that I had blue cheese, and not ranch on my plate. I was expecting our server to show up and ask us how everything was, or to ask if we need anything else but no nothing. Since we were seated near a server station my husband waved down another server who was standing around conversing with another server. She fingered hold on to my husband and finished her conversation. She finally came over and asked my husband if he needed something and when he said we needed a side of ranch, and buffalo sauce she ran off to get it. Another server (still not ours) brought the ranch, and said she'd be back with the buffalo sauce. 2 minutes later, the buffalo sauce finally arrived. After our meals were almost done another server saw that our drinks were low, and offered to refill them. Once completely finished, our server finally arrived and asked about dessert.

Happy hour is M-F 4-6pm with reduced price drinks and appetizers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson,3.28,3.63,3.556,,3.49
200,Jean G.,"Bullhead City, AZ",87,267,143.0,4.0,2018-01-05,"***PROS*** * Short wait for table - 10 mins * Attentive waiter - never hungry, thirsty, or wondering where he was * Great food! We had 4-cheese pasta which tasted like a pizza with so much flavor, herb-crusted, grilled salmon with broccoli and mashed potatoes that were wonderful, and tempura-battered fish tacos with chipotle sauce, pickled red cabbage, salsa and guacamole that was delicious.  * Complimentary bread at table was warm and fresh, served with large pats of butter * Strawberry lemonade had real strawberry seeds in it, sugar rim on the glass, and wonderful sour flavor.  * Cheesecake to go was packaged with extra whipped cream and plenty of napkins & forks ***CONS*** The only ""con"" was that the waiter mentioned the computers were slow because of a Christmas coupon that was difficult to enter yet many customers were using. I wish we knew about the coupon. I'd say check their website for details, get on their mailing list, or follow their social media accounts for details.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson,3.24,3.62,3.568,,3.468000000000001
18,David M.,"Henderson, NV",0,3,,2.0,2018-01-06,"I suggest not ordering 'To Go'...didn't want to wait an hour for a table on a Saturday night, so we decided to order and pick up. Every single time I order for pick up at this location they get my order wrong or forget something:/ Tonight they forgot the fries to my daughter's kids meal and got my order wrong.. I ordered the teriyaki chicken with brown rice but with boneless chicken breasts instead of the bone in. The rice was undercooked and still hard and they gave me the bone in chicken.. I know they are busy, but if I'm paying $100 including tip for our meal, it should be right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=20,3.16,3.6,3.56,,3.424000000000001

201,Sam O.,"Las Vegas, NV",118,98,215.0,2.0,2018-01-11,"So let me start by saying we are HUGE fans of the Cheesecake Factory ! They have amazing Food with a great all around selection of dishes , desserts and appetizers!! We have been going here since it has opened and in no way will we stop going and or want anyone reading this to be discouraged of going as well !!  Tonight we decided to go during HAPPY HOUR to have a couple drinks, dinner and spend some time together as a couple ! Our service was an issue from the start with a very slow start ! We ordered our drinks and something was floating in my wife's drink and we asked for another one ! We watched very closely to ensure that she received a fresh drink and this time the glass was dirty ! Third one was the charm although she really on drank one drink !! My beer on the other was tasty but and hour later finally received my second !  The waitress was nice and we did give her some feedback and I must say she had enough courage to tell her manager without us asking ! The first manager approached us and was full of excuses from the start blaming Happy Hour - For real , you have happy hour the same time everyday and a manager should never Make Excuses !! They had 2 bartenders three servers and a manager with less than 50 people to wait on ! Later on in the evening Dawn , another manager came to our table and took full responsibility and apologized 100% with no excuses giving us a 6.00 discount ! We were not looking for anything but I must say overall a disappointing experience this time around !!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson,3.0,3.58,3.552,,3.3480000000000008
203,Nafal Z.,"Irvine, CA",14,95,44.0,5.0,2018-01-13,"I love Cheesecake Factory. It's by far my favorite place to go, especially with the family since there is so much variety to choose from.i usually end up getting appetizers as meals every time I go. This time was no different except I added a cup of clam chowder to it. Oh man, that clam chowder was amazing. And filling! I could hardly finish my other food. I got nachos, sweet corn tamale cakes along with the mix of egg rolls (sorry, no picture). Avocado, Cuban, chicken southwest and the salmon one. In my opinion all tasted great except for the Cuban one, didn't care for the ham flavor in it. I just wasn't a big fan of it. Everything else, amazing. This place will always be a favorite of mine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson,3.04,3.6,3.556,,3.376000000000001
