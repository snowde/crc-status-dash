1437,Bear A.,"Honolulu, HI",0,2,,1.0,2012-01-07,"Although the food is not that special, I like to go here once in a while.  But today, I was totally disappointed.  We waited in line to be on the waiting list. The two Caucasian guys in front of us were told that the waiting time will be 30min. But when we went to put our names down after them, the girl told us that the waiting time for two of us will be 1hour and 20min. How could it be 1 hour and 20 min wait when it was only 30 min for the two guys right in front of us!???? I felt that it was a discrimination. Btw, we are local Chinese and Japanese. Later on, I went back here to look at their cheesecakes, and I over heard the same girl telling two Caucasian customers that the waiting time would be 30min and told the two middle eastern customers that the waiting minutes will be 1 hour and 20min!!!!! What is up with that!? That is a discrimination!

I was seated immediately going in, but once I got my table that's when the trouble started.

1054,Billy W.,"Honolulu, HI",63,111,12.0,4.0,2012-01-08,"I've always avoided this restaurant over the years because of the long lines. Is it really worth the long wait? But today, enough is enough! Attempted to beat the lines and went at 10:45-ish. Sure enough, no wait! The menu was incredibly long but I ordered the Louisiana Chicken and my friend got the Crusted Chicken Romano. They were both really good! I especially loved their chicken seasoning, best chicken I've ever had. HOWEVER, I found a long piece of saran wrap stuck to the chicken but the manager promptly came out to apologize. No biggie I guess as long as it isn't bugs in my food. The service was pretty good too; drinks were always kept full. SIDE NOTE: Their iced teas are the ""literally iced tea"" kind of ice tea! If you like your sweet tea, it's better for you to order something else to drink. Next is dessert! If you're here for lunch, I'd highly recommend their smaller lunch specials (available til 5 p.m.) because you'd have more room for dessert! Now this is the reason why (I believe) people brave the long lines for this place: cheesecake! There were so many choices (cheesecakes themselves were 1.5 pages long accompanied by another 1.5 pages of other desserts) that it'd be cool if they had some sort of cheesecake sampler. Ordered the Chocolate Raspberry Truffle and the Vanilla Bean. They were both very sweet but VERY good. I've tried the frozen Cheesecake Factory cheesecake from Costco but these are entirely of another quality. Couldn't finish either cheesecake because was too full (even with the lunch-sized specials!), be sure to have a glass of water on hand. All in all, it was a great experience and I'd come back again! For lunch. No wait if you're there really early. Smaller portions.

With the wait time up to more than an hour at peak times such as dinner and lunch.... I prefer others, I like to live a little and try something new. If you haven't been to a Cheesecake factory the one in Redondo Beach, Calif is the one to try. Right on the ocean, outside seating or the regular noisey indoor seating as the this one. The Honolulu location is like any other indoor restaurant. If you sit outdoors on the patio have people staring at you as they walk down the busiest sidewalk  on any of the Hawaiian islands.  No view unless you like to look at badly dressed tourists...Chucks and Shorebird both have views and in the same area in Honolulu.  You're on a Island don't spend your time waiting for a table that won't remind you you're in the tropics but will make you think you're back in the city.

1134,Allison D.,"Newark, NJ",57,225,115.0,2.0,2012-01-12,"This place is a trip! The wait is always long...plan on waiting about 2 hours for a table at dinner time. However, its a prime spot for people watching which can make the time go by quickly. The bar is open seating, but people are like vultures in there, so keep an eye out and act fast if you see a table! Note: although they are in the bar area, the low tables are not open seating, just the high tables and the bar stools. The portions are HUGE. The food is mediocre; not great, not horrible. I got the chicken and biscuits and made THREE meals out of it. My boyfriend got the jambalaya and made two meals out of it. This place is great for a big group of picky eaters, everyone should be able to find something they like on the extensive, diverse menu. Service is pretty standard. Even if you recieve somewhat bad service, its hard to be angry as you watch your server sprinting around trying to give personal service to the never ending guests without skipping a beat or even stopping to catch their breath.

We never have any bad experience with Cheesecake Factory, service is always good and sincere, we always feel that we are being welcomed. Even if we go there at late night time, they would check with us if we need anything else before the closing time so that we get to order anything that we have in mind (especially the dessert!).

30,G M.,"Denver, CO",0,48,,3.0,2012-01-14,We have been there a few times over the years and it is always consistent: after a very long wait for a table you get good service and PLENTY of good solid food. We tried a variety of things on the extensive menu and no one was disappointed. Only complaint I have is they bring the entres too fast after the appetizer (but that seems to be a failing with all Hawaii restaurants) and then try to cram all the dishes onto the small tables. We were celebrating a birthday and the birthday boy got a rousing rendition of happy birthday from several waiters which was very nice.   They do however have surprisingly lousy cheesecake ( we have tried a half dozen different ones)  and the strawberry shortcake was rated not so hot either.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1420,3.44,3.69,3.66,3.1800000000000006,3.5900000000000003
1339,Alvin P.,"Mililani, HI",6,7,,4.0,2012-01-16,"Okay, as someone who lives quite far from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki, I come out here once in a while to eat at The Cheesecake Factory (mainly because a lot of my friends like going here and it's either this or Zippy's.) Anyways, besides what everyone else is saying about the (at-times) ridiculous wait times, the food and service here is pretty good! There has never been a time when I was utterly dissatisfied with the food and/or service we got. Hosts and waiters are extremely friendly (my host made a joke about how she wouldn't be able to fit into my skinny jeans as she led us to our table) and the waiters are very friendly, are quick to answer any questions you may have on their diverse menu, and don't pester you to hurry up and scram once you finish your meal (we were still eating even though the restaurant was closed.) I got the Chicken Bellagio, which wasn't HOLY SH*T(!) spectacular, and a bit bland for my taste, but it was still the same level of quality I've come to expect from The Cheesecake Factory. Here's a tip: if you're here for the first time, you may think that their dishes are a bit pricey for what you're seemingly getting, but damn, it's like the restaurant is planning on fattening you up to cook you, because the portions here are HUGE. Therefore, if you and your friend are both ""eh...kinda hungry but not really,"" then I highly suggest splitting an entree because both of you will probably be full, happy, content, and all that jazz. If not, just ask your waiter to pack up the rest of your food in a doggy bag and heat it up the next day at work or something. Every single time I've been here, I never been able to finish all my food in one sitting. And trust me, I have the appetite of a ravenous gorilla. Parking is also super convenient. Free with validation at the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center. I haven't really tried their cheesecake before so I can't really comment on that (which would probably defeat the purpose of this entire review) but oh well!

1158,Pip Y.,Australia,0,24,,3.0,2012-01-31,"Always a pleasure to have a meal at the Cheesecake Factory :) Things to be aware of:  it starts to get busy around 5pm for dinner and they will assign you with a buzzer that goes off when your table is ready - the wait can be more than an hour!  Also once seated the restaurant is so busy and can acommodate so many people that it is very noisy so don't expect to be able to have an intimate conversation because you have to speak loud to be heard. Apart from that - the menu is massive and there are so many choices - be warned that the portions are ridiculously large and the staff will also let you know.  But if there is a smaller portion of your item on offer - I suggest you go for it because I can eat ... and i have never finished anything I have ordered there.  Salads are even huge ;) The service is attentive and staff are friendly.  It's an experience you have to go and try - meals are yum and I can recommend:  the spicy chicken sliders, BBQ chicken salad, chicken & biscuits and the seeded brown bread that you get at your table when you are seated!  All great :) PS always to full to sample the cheesecakes - so have never actually tasted them ... but they look good (!)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1020,3.48,3.68,3.668,3.1480000000000006,3.6000000000000005

The one thing I always get is the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo. And why come to Cheesecake Factory without a slice of cheesecake right? I'm old fashioned and I like to stick to the original. The white chocolate cheesecake was amazing, but it was too sweet for my tastebuds. There's so much to choose from, but I always stick to the good ol' gumbo.

You could not ask for a more simple and healthy pasta. But the winner is their marinated Miso Salmon which is simply delicious.

Now for dessert - with so many different kinds of cheesecakes to choose from I am set on dulce de leche caramel cheesecake which is topped with caramel mousse on a vanilla crust. This is my favorite.

Maybe they can be extremely strict about on-time arrival, like ""if you do not arrive within 2 minutes of your reservation time, your spot will be given to the next person and you will be at the back of the line"" or something. It is a HUGE waste of time to have to wait an hour every time I dine here. Their lack of a reservation policy indicates that they are okay with wasting their customers' time, which is a reprehensible way of running a business. Just think of it this way. If you have a party of 2, and your group makes an average of $40/hr at their jobs, the opportunity cost of eating here is $80, just for the wait time.

863,Rebekah L.,"Honolulu, HI",16,63,141.0,4.0,2012-04-08,"I had never been to The Cheesecake Factory before, and with both the good and bad reviews, it's difficult to ascertain whether or not it's worth a visit. But because my family decided we'd celebrate my brother's girlfriend's birthday by going to The Cheesecake Factory, I was going to be able to form my own opinion. One thing The Cheesecake Factory is known for is their slightly ridiculous wait time. If you're expecting to eat here for dinner, do expect to be waiting atleast an hour or so before being seated. Fortunately, the lunch shift is a bit more relaxed in the sense that we'd only had to wait for fifteen minutes. After being buzzed, we had to fight our way to the reception desk where we were promptly--though midly hindered by a busboy being harangued--seated. When the waiter finally arrived, he gave us a brief introduction about the place and left to give us some time to look over the menu. What I really enjoyed about their menu is that they had a great variety of different choices that would even suit the pickiest of eaters. So even though we all had our different tastes/palates, we were all able to find something to our liking. When the waiter returned, we'd asked what their most popular appetizers were. And unfortunately, I can't recall what he'd told us, but we ended up ordering their lettuce wraps and fried calamari. If you've been to P.F. Chang's before, they too, are famous for their lettuce wraps. But in my opinion, I much preferred The Cheesecake Factory's lettuce wraps. It was just well put-together and the food combinations were delicious. The fried calamari was a real treat too as their batter was very light and crispy, almost like a mix of rice and mochiko flour.  For the main course, we ordered an angel hair pasta dish with red sauce, a skinnylicious chicken dish with asparagus, tomatoes, and onions, the bang bang chicken and shrimp, and the eggs benedict with tomatoes and spinach. All of us enjoyed our dishes except for my brother who'd ordered the bang bang. It was unfortunately, without much of a ""bang."" But other than that, everything went smoothly enough. We weren't able to try any of their cheesecakes considering we had an ice cream cake waiting at home, but maybe next time.

Let's start with my first meal.  I'll take the miso salmon.  It's delightful.  Turn to page473 of your menu, and Its halfway down.  I know, you're asking yourself how a mainland chain restaurant could possibly make a terrific miso salmon.  But they do!  It comes on a bed a superb mashed potatoes.   My second meal: Chicken Piccata.  I always ask for it without mushrooms (I'm ""allergic""), and not once have they made the mistake of putting them in.  This is so great with their angel hair pasta.  They give a generous portion, so I can eat my leftovers the next day! Another great thing about Cheesecake is the bread.  The sourdough is excellent, and if you ask for them to pack some with your leftovers, they usually are happy to oblige.   The only negative?  UGH...the wait.  If you'd like to go there on a special occasion, be prepared to wait.  I've gone there for three birthdays of mine, and every time it's been close to a 2 hour wait if not more.  I wish they took reservations for parties over 8 or 12 or something.  My personal hint: bring snacks  ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=980,3.56,3.64,3.672,3.152,3.6080000000000005
1197,Jimmy L.,"Honolulu, HI",103,134,223.0,4.0,2012-04-24,"3.5 is accurate This restaurant does not take reservations and of course, it doesn't really need to because they're packed. It helps to go about an hour before you actually plan to eat, to sign in. The time it takes for you to be seated, order, and get your food is enough to strike up a healthy appetite. Also, try not to order appetizers unless you have a big group. You want to save room for the meal and DESSERT which is why you're at the CHEESECAKE Factory, right? About a week ago, we all came for a celebratory dinner. The wait was about half an hour around 5:00pm and we were seated near the outer area (which I prefer because inside is too dim). Being such a big fan of steak, I decided to order the ribeye. However, on their menu, they only mentioned the ribeye being grilled and not ""char grilled"". Hence, the special request. Unfortunately, I don't think the waitress knew the difference. She stated, ""oh, it is."" when I asked for my ribeye to be char grilled. Needless to say, the food wasn't up to par. The fries which came with the steak were great though! The ribeye itself is actually better than the one I've had at Roy's Waikiki unfortunately and at half the price, I shouldn't complain. I take the points off for the lack of reservation options and the food. Although there was nothing WRONG with my food, I was just not impressed. My friend on the other hand had a bad dinner.

I tried to order my favorite thai chicken pasta but the woman at the counter informed me that it had been discontinued. I shook my fist in the air and screamed ""Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"" After my fit and several rounds of crying, I proceeded to order the tomato basil penne pasta and a french country salad which consisted of greens, asparagus, beets and goat cheese. I ran back to my booth and returned twenty minutes later for my order. Back at the Yelp booth the three of us (me, Thomas O & Pua P) dove into the two dishes. The portions in classic Cheesecake Factory style were gigantic! The pasta was nothing too adventurous but satisfying. The french country salad exceeded my expectations and was very tasty! It's something I'd certainly order again on a return visit. $25 fed all three of us so it wasn't too shabby of a deal! The service at the bakery counter was alright but I thought it lacked overall attentiveness. They seemed really busy checking on their registers and cheesecakes, but wouldn't it have been better to tend to the customer first? I waited for someone to help me both times while ordering and upon my return to pick up my food. The phone kept ringing again and again while I was there and all I could keep thinking was ""That's your customer on the phone. Will someone pick it up?!""

Just to explain about the noise...We were seated all the way in the back adjacent to the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.  Unfortunately there was at outside party that night at the hotel and the loudness of the base and music made it difficult for us to carry a conversation, hear our waiter and it was just a bad experience.  It's too bad they don't have the option to close the outside when theres events being held at the hotel.   I could tell that we weren't the only ones that weren't enjoying ourselves.  Some of the older Japanese tourists were covering their ears and making faces.  I don't mind noise in restaurants, but this was just bad.   Now the food.  We had a party of 8, and everyone ordered something different so we all can taste because there are SO MUCH items to choose from!!!  To be honest, they could get rid of a lot, because they jut did not taste great.  Not to be too critical, but I think you would have high expectations especially when the wait time is so long.  To tell you the truth, none of they entrees we ordered had a wow factor.  It was just all ""okay"". The only great or tasty meal we enjoyed is again, the bread, cheesecake, and the spicy ahi tempura roll. Ah service...it was eh, ok.  When they brought out our food, they told my mom that they're still cooking her asparagus and it would be out shortly.  My mom waited and waited, and just started to eat her meal.  Of course it never came, and when the waiter came to check up on us, she explained that she was still waiting.    You could tell she was upset, and he brought the manager over.  The manager and over apologizing with a plate of asparagus (which was only 2 pieces), and she said that she didn't want it since she was already done eating .  The manager then offered ""1"" free cheesecake. ONE!?  Are u kidding me?  We've gone to other restaurants and they would take a percentage off the bill and they only thing he offered was a slice of cheesecake!?    Kinda mind boggling, but they're just not interested in customers returning I guess. I remember eating here years ago and remembering the food tasting a lot better.    My advice is to skip the wait, don't waste your time, and they sell cheesecakes at Costco, so YOU know WHERE to go! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=680,3.44,3.56,3.64,3.1760000000000006,3.5120000000000005

If you plan to go on a Friday or weekend you should expect to wait 1.5-2 hours for your table. One little trick if you are a party of 4 or less is to linger over by the bar and wait for a table there. That's what I did with my friends last night and the three of us were sitting down eating our delicious free bread in less than 30 minutes!! The food here is good and the price is not very high. I paid $19.50 for my meal incl. tip and couldn't finish it all (the portions here are HUGE) so I had lunch for the next day too! It's a great location because you can park at the Royal Hawaiian Center and they validate parking too. I also love it how it's right beside the 3-storey Forever 21 and Bebe and Tory Burch and Kate Spade... so even if you are waiting for a table you can shop around while you wait. For guys maybe that isn't so appealing but a girls night out at the Cheesecake factory is a lot of fun!! I like their salads too. They are fresh, GIANT size, and filling and average price around $15.

1100,Ben D.,"New York, NY",420,38,,4.0,2012-06-20,"Despite the long wait time and the fact that it is in the most touristy area on island, I have a strong, undying love for this place that I've come to for some pretty big occasions, many of which happened to be birthdays, including my own a few years ago. I recommend going for lunch if you're looking to get in and out relatively fast because the dinner crowd is like no other and will have you waiting anywhere from 45 minutes to two hours. Luckily, it is located on the west side of the Royal Hawaiian shopping center, so feel free to shop while you wait. But be sure to come back earlier than your anticipated seating time because they often seat you faster than they expect to. When you get inside, there are four or five different areas of the restaurant that you could be seated in. Dining outside in either of their two outdoor seating areas is always enjoyable and personally preferred. Most times you'll be seated in the indoor booths - still nice.  The wait staff is trained quite thoroughly on the menu and are very helpful for friends who are overwhelmed by the menu - be warned, it is a very extensive menu and quite easy to get lost in. The waiters/waitresses are also really friendly, though conversation with them is tough as the restaurant is extremely busy. Wait time for food is pretty standard, maybe 10-20 minutes, and is entirely worth it as the food always hits the spot (and there's complimentary bread to munch on while you wait - it's divine). Personal favorite dishes include the Wild Mushroom Burger, Garlic Noodles, and Roasted Vegetable Pizza. If you're looking for meat options, consider ordering their Wasabi Crusted Ahi Tuna, a Cuban Sandwich, or their Shrimp with Angel Hair pasta. Otherwise, ask your server for their favorites and order accordingly.  What I haven't gotten around to trying is their breakfast or brunch menus, though I hope to change that soon. As for dessert, cheesecake is a given - and there are so many to choose from! They are all guaranteed to be good. My favorite two are the Key Lime Pie and the Wild Blueberry White Chocolate varieties, conveniently located next to one another on their menu. You receive in quality of service and food what you pay for, so definitely splurge a little when you come, you won't regret it! This place is great for birthdays, special dinners, or just going out with friends. As cheesy as it sounds, any night is a great one for the Cheesecake Factory.

(1)  You have to park at the Royal Hawaiian and walk over.  It's not THAT far of a walk, but still.  It's not easy to just run in and get take out.  Plus, the location is in Waikiki.  I reallllly don't like coming into Waikiki if I don't have to.  If they built another one on island that wasn't in Waikiki, you can guarantee I'd be there all the time! (2)  Twice I've gone there and they ran out of over half the cheesecakes, AKA, all of the flavors I'd want.  It reminds me of when I went to Buca di Beppo and they said they ran out of cheese.  An Italian restaurant running out of CHEESE?!?  That knocked out 93.7% of the menu.   (3)  The wait for dinner is insane.  Like, 2 hours, insane.  Wish they took reservations.  I suggest if you're having a craving, go during lunch time.  I went at around 1 PM on a weekend recently and we waited only 5 minutes.  I dig that.  If you're waiting for dinner, I suggest trekking over to Forever 21 next door.  That store is huge.  Great place to kill time.  Just make sure your buzzer thing is within reach, or make sure someone else who's with you stays closer to the restaurant with it.  :D The food is what keeps me coming back the few times I brave the wait and craziness of Waikiki.  I alwaayyssss have to order the calamari.  It comes with cocktail sauce and some kind of garlic aioli (I really don't know, but it tastes delicious).  Probably one of my favorite places to get calimari, period. The menu is so extensive here, but I pretty much always end up getting the steak diane and salmon combo.  Aaaand the oreo cheesecake to top off the meal doesn't hurt either.  I wish they had some kind of cheesecake sampler though.  I always want to try different flavors but am always worried I won't like it.  Also, best strawberry lemonade.  Period.  They don't just use lemonade with strawberry syrup, they blend real strawberries.  You can see the strawberry seeds in the glass.  Free refills at that.  ;) Build one in Kapolei or something!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=680,3.76,3.58,3.636,3.184,3.652

Once we browsed through the extensive menu (the menu looks like a short story novel but included the wine list and cocktail menu as well) we were ready to order.  I highly recommend ordering the lunch portions of the pasta if you want to minimize leftovers to take back to your hotel and most importantly leave room for cheesecake. The pasta dishes were fantastic in both flavor, portion size and presentation! The burgers were also great (extremely filling).  We lucked out on dining there during their national Cheesecake Day (July 30th: all cheescakes were half price!!). The service as good and attentive considering entering the extremely busy period.  They seemed to have alot of staff to handle the crowd.  When we left (around 5:30pm), the line up out front was absolutely nuts?!?! We were now all set to enjoy the rest of the young evening enjoying the sights if Waikiki.

Even though I am pleased that the cheesecakes come in a variety of flavors, I rather Junior's Cheesecake as far as texture is concerned. I had the Mahi Mahi dinner and it wasn't good, my fish wasn't cooked in some parts and taste bland on it's own. However the mash and tomatoes vinaigrette that came with that meal was genius, the taste profiles definitely went well together and made my tongue do a happy dance in my mouth.

There are many things I love about the Cheesecake Factory:  1) The brown bread. It's sweet, and when you put butter all over it, it's delicioussss. Skip the sour dough though. 2) The cocktails. Give me a frosty Georgia Peach - peachy slushy awesomeness swirled with raspberry - and i'm in heaven!  3) The food. OMG they give SOOOOOOOOOOO much! and it's GOOOOD. I know there's a thousand things on the menu, but I hardly deviate. It's either I want pasta - in which case I get the Farfalle with Chicken and Sundried tomatoes (creamy and delicious), or I want Food-Food - in which case I get the Chicken Madeira (Mashed potatoess!!!), or I want a sandwich - in whch case you gotta go for the Avocado Chicken club craziness which taste like a club sandwich but on grilled cheese.  4) The cheesecake. Red velvet cheesecake. That's it. The end. Stick a fork in me. Delicious. I'm also a very huge fan of the carrot cake cheesecake, and the peanut butter one.  If you are someone who doesn't mind the wait because you intend to use the ""wait"" as an excuse to shop to your drop, then go for it.

Here are some hints -  * It's steps away from Waikiki beach.  * It's open normal hours and busier than the Las Vegas location which is open 24/7. * It's the highest grossing location in the chain. A bartender told me 26M in 2012!  That's right; 26 million from one location!  * At peak times the waits are two hours plus. The crowds are so huge you'd think a superstar was about to arrive.  So would I wait two hours for a meal? Absolutely not but that doesn't mean I don't love these folks. I've never had a bad meal here. The menu is ginormous and the variety will satisfy everyone. The prices are commensurate with the quality and huge portions. The adult libations are strong and the waitstaff is competent. This chain does it right.

Lots of foot traffic as it's also near Forever 21 & Macy's. The wait for our table was for one hour so know you should shop around to kill that hour. Once seated our server was quick to attend to us. We started with the calamari which was not overly breaded and tasty.  Our table shared the Chinese chicken salad, mushroom burger with fries, sweet corn tamale, and Tex Mex roll. Their portions are SUPER DOOPER HUGE!!!! So of course we had leftovers. Overall the foods we had were cooked well and full of flavor. Tex Mex rolls had a nice spicy kick and love the dipping sauce. The sweet corn tamale was a unique and enjoyable dish - it had a sweet hint but the tamale was prepared like mash potatoes with avocado, their secret sauce, cilantro, tomatoes.  This dish is a must try. We were so stuffed but we could not leave without sharing dessert! So our server recommended we try the Oreo cheesecake. It was just the right amount of sweet for us with actual Oreo cookies. Their menu has over 200 items and can be found online, but one of their red wine, Barons De Rothschild, Lafite Reserve Specials was unavailable at this location.

They don't take reservations or call aheads. It was first come first serve only.  When we arrived, the line was well outside the door.  After 20 minutes in line we discovered there were actually two lines.  The first was to put in your name and the second was to get a beeper.   We were told it would be a 1 hour 7 minute  wait.  I checked in after 1 hour and 20 minutes, to find why we hadn't heard from them.  I was told they were ""running a little behind"", and that it would be another 25 minutes.   I checked in after another 40 minutes to ask  why we still hadn't heard from them.  I'm not sure that they didn't know that it would be in excess of a 2 hour wait but just gave customers those ""estimates"" knowing that after someone had already invested more  than 1.5 hours, they would stick around for ""another 25 minutes"". They finally seated us  without the beeper ever going off.  We had to wait quite a while for our server.  We waited even longer for our appetizers. The salads and avocado rolls were fresh and perfectly prepared.   We waited far far too too long for our main course.  When it arrived, two of the meals were acceptable, a third one had a steak that was hot but the salmon was barely over room temperature.  My Macadamia Ono had obviously been sitting in the window for quite a while as the fish was only slightly warm, under seasoned and a little dried out.  My brown rice had no warm to it at all.  The vegetables were perfectly cooked but near cold like the fish and rice.  I finally gave up and told them to just bag it and I'd reheat and doctor it at home.   We next ordered desert.  All they would have to do is cut it and serve right?  How wrong could that go?  When the server checked back with us, he had a distressed look on his face when he realized that after nearly 15 minutes that course not been delivered in anything close to a timely manner either.   The Red Velvet Cheesecake was really good.  I think the reason it took so long to deliver this course to the table is that they must have run out of desert plates. The cheesecake was chilled as it should be, but the dishes were hot.  I'm guessing fresh out of the dish washer.

Their menu is extensive(!) so I can't say that I've tried most things. BUT the things that I have tried, I've liked.  I love their strawberry lemonade. I dig their avocado egg rolls. The firecracker salmon app is yummy. Fried mac n cheese balls are also great. Their meatloaf tastes just like mama made it.  The chicken madiera has never let me down. The bistro shrimp pasta, strangely, tastes better on the mainland.  Their salads are ginormous. And I love, love, love their dulce de leche cheesecake.  Service is friendly. However, I wouldn't wait over 90 minutes to eat here. It's too bad the cheesecake factory is located in waikiki. All the tourists flood this joint.

The  menu is so extensive that it's almost frustrating to try to pick what to eat!  We had two appetizers for the table - avocado spring rolls and crab rangoons.  Both were tasty, but the avocado spring rolls were amazingly good, packed with avocados with a cilantro sauce that really brought out the flavors.  I ordered a passion fruit mojito that was a little weak, but delicious (like minty juice). I also had the macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi, which was very tasty.  BF ordered the white chicken chili, which had white beans and a Southwestern-style, sour creamy flavor with a little kick.  Everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy their food as well.  Service was not lightning fast, but if you consider that we had 8 people, and the restaurant is enormous, it was very reasonable. This place must be a goldmine, because it's almost like a factory the way they get people in and out.  I definitely won't be a frequent patron, because I'm not into waiting over an hour to sit down, but I will return every so often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=820,3.6,3.62,3.652,3.34,3.6120000000000005

Enough reviews on the food, service and normal topics.  What I want to share here is the insightful discussion we had with our sever that impressed us on many levels. There was a fire in the kitchen earlier this year that shut the restaurant down for about a month.  We had read about it in our online edition of the Honolulu Star Advertiser shortly after it happened and were immediately inquisitive about how corporate handled it with their staff, etc. I'm pleased to report that according to our server they really stepped up and took care of everybody.  First, some interesting stats: this is one of the busiest locations in the nation. With over 400 on staff, they seat between 4,000 and 5,000 people PER DAY.  That alone amazed us. The efficiency of this place is astounding. Our server said that one of the first things they did was have several get togethers with tons of free food.  There isn't another Cheesecake Factory nearby so they couldn't transfer the inventory. Corporate gave it all away to the staff.   Secondly, they took care of them financially.  Granted, with the numbers they push through here, it wasn't practical to let everyone go and then re-hire and attempt to train again in a month, so paying everyone while the restaurant was inoperable was really the best business decision. Still, corporate is to be commended on their fairness.  They averaged their employees last six weeks of 2012 including tips and came up with a weekly salary.  In addition, they also allowed for you to cash in vacation time if you so desired. Our server said some employees grumbled, thinking they should have gotten more but not him. He thought it was more than fair and even took the opportunity to take his family on vacation. My wife and I could not speak highly enough about this Cheesecake Factory.  The food. The service. The atmosphere (patio, early seating) and the way in which they took care of their staff....all outstanding! Oh, and this night's dinner?  Delicious as always. I tried a new dish per our server's recommendation: Bang Bang Chicken and loved every bite!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=580,3.88,3.71,3.68,3.572,3.778

For dinner, she had the meatloaf and I the carbonara pasta, ended our meal with two desserts. Of course we ended up doggy bagging our dinner and desserts because of the size of these dishes.

My son ordered pasta cabonera, very salty, and when we spoke to the very young manager he goes on to explain the process of how its cooked, salt in pasta water, etc.This is a salty dish.  Son asked why they didn't taste it before they sent it out? And why would they have a salty dish on their menu? Not much of an apology, only excuses. He needs to go back to managerial school 101, customer is always right.

I ordered the passion fruit mojito, chicken Bellagio which comes w prosciutto and arugula, and tiramisu for dessert. Loved all of it. I loved that the tiramisu was delicious too, even though it wasn't one of their famous cheesecakes.

633,Taryn L.,"Honolulu, HI",161,221,1283.0,4.0,2013-06-12,"This is one of my favorite restaurants on the island.  My love for the Cheesecake Factory shows every time I brave the Waikiki crowds and the hour wait for a table just to get one of their pasta dishes.  While this restaurant is known for their namesake (and their cheesecake is good), I ALWAYS come back for the Pasta da Vinci. It's penne pasta in a delicious (and addicting) wine sauce with chicken, mushrooms and onions. The waiter normally will freshly grate/shred cheese on top of the pasta. There is just something about that pasta sauce that calls to me; it's slightly sweet and not too rich.  I've never found any entree like it.  When you're at the Cheesecake Factory, you always have to save room for dessert. They have a multitude of flavors of cheesecake, plus other types if desserts too. I usually get the vanilla bean cheesecake - it's surprisingly light for a cheesecake. The flavor isn't overpowering or overly sweet. I've also had their lemon raspberry cream, peppermint (seasonal), white chocolate raspberry truffle, and the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake slices. No matter which ones I've tried, the vanilla bean still takes the number one spot for me (okay...that peppermint cheesecake for the holiday season is a close second - if only they had it year-round!). Also, keep in mind, that with all cheesecake slices, they give these huge dollops of whipped cream. Just delicious! (I try not to think of calories when I eat here) The food and the cheesecakes are amazing here and their bread is just as fantastic.  At other restaurants, I normally don't eat the bread so I have room for appetizers, the entree, and dessert, but here, I skip apps and I eat the bread. If I didn't love that pasta so much, I'd consider eating just the bread for my meal. It's that good. Plus, it is complimentary.  Tips: - When you come here, expect at least a 45 minute wait to be seated - get your parking validated - always save room for dessert :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=480,3.72,3.73,3.68,3.152,3.7260000000000004
1025,Karen E.,"Honolulu, HI",84,120,139.0,5.0,2013-06-14,"I have no idea why it has taken me this long to write a review.  Besides Kailua I am always in Waikiki.   And what better way to spend my time here but to dine at The Cheesecake Factory!  I have been coming here way before my yelp review days and even before Forever 21 was right across from their entrance.  I think it use to be Town&Country Surf or something like that.  Oh and way before they remodeled the whole Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center.  Needless to say I really love eating here.Decor is second to none.  I love how  you can dine outdoors and do some people watching or indoors to enjoy the beautiful wood trimming on the ceiling and what looks like hand painted art on the walls.  It might be just wallpaper but who cares I love the look of it.  It is usually a little dim if you dine here in the evenings but during brunch or the day it is perfect lighting.Now wait time depends on when you come here to eat.  During the day it's not so bad but the evening and especially during the weekends it is busy!  They take down your name and you are handed a pager and the usual time is 45 minute wait.  There are some benches on the side with cusions to sit on while you wait but good luck on finding one that's not already claimed.  There is also a rock wall you can sit on right across from the entrance but after awhile your butt starts to get real sore.  Then there is always Forever 21 for the ladies and guys too.  If you have read my review my other reviews my husband who is a metro type of dude has purchased serveral things from here but will not admit it to his friends.  Last if you have read up to this part of the review you  would be lucky enough to know the secret of waiting at the most 30 minutes for a table or less.  This tip is for you people that have kids 5 or 6 years and older or a small group of friends 4 or 5 tops.  Before I had my baby it was just my husband, my older daughter 7 yrs old, and myself coming in to dine.  Instead of getting a regular table we would head down to the high bar tables that are located right behind the bar counter.  There are about four or five tables with four chairs at each table and it is first come first serve basis.  So if you see an empty table grad it quick because there are sometimes others stalking for a table too.  Now if you have five people in your party hopefully you can grab one of the empty bar chairs.  They serve you drinks from the bar and the whole menu and you wait half the time for a table then having to go through the whole getting a pager and waiting FOREVER!!!  Reward for reading my review.  And if you already knew about my little secret then I'll move on to the best part the FOOD. Appetizers -Ahi Poke Salad --Deep Fried Mac&Cheese----Crazy goodness here!  You get four deep fried balls of mac&cheese over a red sauce I'm assuming it's marinara --Lettuce Wraps---I thinks it's chicken or is it pork...I forgot but this plate is huge --Nachos----Order only one plate of this.  WARNING you will not finish this so make sure you share.  Whatever you can imagine is on these nachos. Entrees --Chicken Alfredo---Cheesy saucey goodness.  Enough said. Oh and chicken --Cuban Sandwich with sweet potato Fries --Shirmp Club Sandwich with Fries--Shirmp is perfectly cooked, bacon, turkey, and whatever else goes on a regular club sandwich --I want to say Chicken Marsala but it's one of their popular plates.  I remember eating a pasta also with marsala I think it was raviloli but yes their pasta plates are great also --Hawaiian Pizza--I love ham and pineapples --Kalua Pizza--Shreaded porky goodness --Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich--Lots of flavor, Huge, very crispy, THE BEST chicken sandwich you will ever have tried --Bang Band Chicken and Shirmp--It comes with rice.  If you like Thai food this is a good choice Desserts --Cheesecake is their main dessert so here a list that I've tried and I will mention if I like it or not Oreo Cheesecake--Don't like it... Too Sweet for my taste Reese Cheesecake--Another one I don't care for too sweet Dulce De Leche--I have ordered this everytime ever since I found out that it has the perfect balance of creamy rich cheesecake and dulce yumminess Key Lime--It's a little tart but not too much Vanilla Bean--If you don't like the regular cheesecake with the sour cream this is the next best thing Banana Cream--I love this cheesecake.  It is the first cheesecake I had from here and it is light if you don't want something too rich Strawberry--It is a classic combo can't go wrong Original--Comes with sour cream topping.  I love the sour and sweet combo.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=880,3.8,3.76,3.684,3.22,3.776

Having been here roughly a dozen times, the service has generally been great. This means that they were friendly and capable of answering questions. Food choices? TOO MANY! Come in at lunch time for sizeable portions for a bit less. And trust me, you'll still get your fill, considering you'll be eating that mandatory dessert right? On top of the listed choices, meals such as the salmon have different flavoring! And they're very accommodating if you're allergic or wanting that extra sauce.  Now onto the cheesecakes - my suggestions: For those that want a light, but neutral flavor cheesecake that goes well even when you're full - the vanilla bean cheesecake. In fact, I would have to put it in my top 3 cheesecakes because it's delicious and very satisfying. If you want something fruity and familiar, my absolute favorite - dutch apple streusel cheesecake. My favorite because I love dutch apple pie and it's not overly sweet, despite having caramel in it. The nuts and cinnamon dutch pie crumbs help to keep the sweetness in check. A definite win. Want something sour? KEY LIME. Prepare to have your face implode. If you like sour, but not painful sour, the mango key lime pie is a better choice. Chocolate lover? The Godiva or new Oreo cheesecake is very delicious. Random dessert? I suggest the Chocolate Truffle Tower Cake. Not a cheesecake but enormous and very flavorful.  It does not receive a full 5-stars because it is exclusively in Waikiki and locals, such as myself, must travel from the other side of the island to enjoy the delicacies that is heaven.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=800,3.36,3.69,3.632,3.44,3.5580000000000003

Spacious - I think I heard a live musician somewhere, or was it the music? Of the 2 I've been to in Seattle during the night, this place is perhaps slightly-y-y-y more dim. Chad, the bartender, was very smooth and on tempered rails as I watched him make various drinks over the course of the night; he's also very laidback & chill. I went for ze incredible grilled eggplant sandwich (overstatement?) and it was very nice---messy---but nice! Good stuff, along with the subbed sweet potato fries. One thing I forgot the CCF has is complimentary bread! Ohh, I especially love the dark bread. The Kentucky Tea drink came out in a slendered out glass and had a subtle buzz. All was darn good to me.

1313,Henry C.,"Denver, CO",0,27,,3.0,2013-09-24,"Food was good! Crusted Macaroni and Cheese appetizer was very rich and creamy. The highlight of the meal. Service was very good. Our waiter was very attentive to our table. We ate during lunch service. This isn't necessarily a con, in a sense, but when you ask for a box, they actually take your plate away and box up your leftovers themselves. My question is, where do they do it? In the kitchen somewhere? Is there an exclusive Boxer person who's specialty is to box up food? Does the server do it him or herself (what if you upset the server, will they botch your leftovers with spit or something)? Seems kind of shady. Once it's boxed up they put it in a bag and tie the bag up, so keep that in mind if you have leftovers, or just finish your plate. Minus 1 star. Recommendation to any couples going in to eat: Request a booth. I repeat, request a booth and if the wait is extra for that, then so be it. You will thank me. If you do not request one you may be seated in a section of the restaurant where tables for two are all setup in close proximity to each other and you will pretty much be dining with other couples. It's very awkward and hard to carry on a conversation because other couples can hear you, and visa-versa. Minus 1 star.

I wish I had asked what her name was so I could ask for her section again.  I got the pizza & salad lunch special and it was great and big enough for 2 or one really hungry person. I wanted to share with  my friend, but unfortunately we didn't do that. I got the hawaiian pizza and caesar salad. The hawaiian pizza had kalua pig, pineapple, red peppers and red onions. The pizza wasn't much to look at but it was so delicious that I wanted to keep eating it. The half salad I got was also pretty big and had a lot of dressing on it, I would highly recommend asking for your dressing on the side, I know I will. We all shared the wild blueberry white chocolate cheesecake and it was absolutely delicious. Because there were 4 of us sharing we were given an extra dollop of whipped cream.

Within in 10 minutes our buzzer went off - quickest wait time I've ever experienced.

She then returned and led us to a two seater table along a banquet. Our waiter promptly came over and took our orders. I was mainly here for the cheesecake however I did order a little something to pass the time until dessert. I love the complimentary soft and warm bread they serve here. The dark rye is my favourite. For Main I ordered the: Asian Chicken Salad w/ Grilled Chicken, Romaine, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Green Onions, Cilantro, Rice Noodles, Wontons, Almonds and Sesame Seeds Served with Sesame-Soy Dressing The description of this salad sounded soo enticing and I love a crunchy salad however after a couple of bites I found it too be quite boring and lacking something in the flavor department. My husband ordered Smokehouse B.B.Q. Burger w/ Smoked Bacon and Melted Cheddar with Crispy Onion Rings and B.B.Q. Ranch Sauce He loved his burger, it was pretty juicy cooked perfectly medium rare and a hefty burger too!

Let's be honest everyone, NO ONE likes to deal with the traffic and parking that is Waikiki.  I haven't been here in years, but recently got to return due to a little staycation and seized the opportunity. I arrived Friday around 6pm and was frantically running towards the door after seeing families and couples lining the outside seating area and walls waiting to go in. I was told my party would have to wait an hour. Ok, not as bad as it could have been. The wait passed by quickly and we were seated shortly after coming back in. Now, the one thing I usually warn people about the Cheesecake Factory is that the prices are a little steep but the portions are that much steeper. No, they are HUGE. I always have enough for a full lunch the next day. Now that's saying something, because I usually eat a lot. My favorite dish there is the Chicken Bellagio. It's bread crumb-crusted chicken filet topped with prosciutto served on a bed of basil pasta and an arugula salad on top. And like I said, it's HUGE. I would definitely recommend this to everyone. I also tried the Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms this visit and dat sauce! Need I say more? Onto dessert. Who goes to the CHEESECAKE factory without getting cheesecake?! Blasphemy. I've tried several in the past. Honorable mentions going out to the White Chocolate Raspberry, Lemoncello and the Strawberry Original. Tonight, we decided to split the Red Velvet Cheesecake. It's two layers of red velvet cake along with two layers of normal cheesecake, which equals heaven in your mouth. Done!

We started our meal with the ahi poke...now that was good but expensive.  It came layered with fried won ton pi and the sauce was really tasty, the perfect amount of kick to it.  It had a small tossed salad on the side which was great because the poke was maybe only a 1/4 pound serving.  Too little for the price (around $15) and waaay too little for 3 people. I would have just ordered another poke for myself if it wasn't so expensive. Price not listed on the menu which means if you gotta ask how much you prolly can't afford it.  LOL Anyways, I opted for the chopped salad entree which would have been perfect had it not been for pieces of corn....yuck.  I like corn but I think it should be popped, or stay on the cob, not put in a tossed green salad.  So I actually sat there and picked it out. Others in my party had a rib eye steak which was pretty good sized and tasted ok.  The other entree that was ordered was Chicken Bellagio which was a pasta dish with a  bunch of cilantro on top.  Ok if you like it. We also had drinks which may be why our bill was high, the cocktail menu also don't have prices on it....remember: if you gotta ask how much......

First off, it's located in Waikiki, which means you will most likely be waiting 2 hours at dinner time.  It's such a pain but sometimes it's the only place that works for everyone because they serve such a wide variety of foods- soups, salads, sandwiches, pasta, pizza, seafood, steak, etc.  The list goes on and on. My favorite dish is probably the Luau Salad.  It's really fresh and filling, and I'm a huge fan of the crunchy wonton that comes with it.  I also loooove their baked potato soup (but their soups change daily).  I could eat a bowl of soup and bread and be completely satisfied.  THEY MAKE IT FROM SCRATCH!

Their sweet potato fries are good as a side.  And I also like their herb salmon, which comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Their kalua pig pizza and four cheese pasta is good too but both are heavy heavy dishes so be wary!

Service is usually pretty good and so is the food.  But it's crazy busy all the time so I think sometimes that can affect the service and the food.  It's good if you want somewhere that is decently nice but not too expensive.  The only annoyance I have is that it's always too busy and you have to park in the royal hawaiian.  They validate for sure but it's only two hours and you're usually waiting for 2 hours just to get into the restaurant.  You'll have to pay for parking beyond 2 hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=380,3.56,3.75,3.7,3.3120000000000003,3.6740000000000004

Often we get ""to go"" as it is so convenient, especially because they are so busy. Why so busy? The food is outstanding. ALTHOUGH recently they are lacking... We always would order the combo platter (sauces to die for) of Steak Diane/Shrimp Scampi. We've been ordering this dish all over the country (as we are travelers) and it is outstanding. Now a change??? You see it used to be with the side of mashed potatoes you could exchange for free the fettuccine Alfredo. This goes much better with it anyway!!! NOW they charge $3.99 if you want to trade! Bad. THEN they change the steak. It used to be 3 nice medallions of steak. Tender, great cut. Now it's only a few little ""hunks"" of meat. Barely a bite for approx. $22. Sooo we are now not ordering that favorite meal anymore. CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHY???  Next the good news... kinda... we had a very bad experience with a waiter. Short, nasty, clumping the plate down, cold food -- we were told by another staff member he left the food on the line because he HAD to wait for our fettuccine Alfredo to be cooked.... so... he left his shift for the day. Lucky for us. We had to send the cold food back. Marshall Freedman the Manager came out and couldn't have been nicer. He accommodated us this one time and did not charge the surprise $3.99 charge to change to fettuccine Alfredo. JEREMY J was our new waiter. He went above and beyond and is a great asset to this facility. The ending was good. Unfortunately we won't buy our favorite combo anymore due to the above aforementioned quality and upcharge of substitute.

I've been here before so I know how long the line can get - and well, I have no patience when I'm hungry. The wait for lunch was short, only 10 minutes to get a seat. When seated, our waitress took our drink orders then came back for the appetizer and entree orders. It took a while for our drinks to come out, and later on, the appetizer and entree took a while too. So much so, that I already got full off the free bread. I ordered a fresh squeezed lemonade. It was pretty good and came with a sugar rimmed glass. What I found weird was they gave you no butter knives for the bread. Our waitress was barely to be found so we used a spoon to put butter on the bread. Lame. We ordered kalua pork nachos for our appetizer. This was the best part of the meal. I loved the pico de gallo and guacamole on it. The chips were crispy, had lots of cheese and loved the jalapeno toppings. I ordered the lunch special Pizza with Everything and a salad with ranch dressing. The salad was so-so. Not much taste to the dressing at all. The greens were a spring mix and it was fresh. I just had to add a little salt to the greens for more taste, which I rarely ever do. The pizza was meh. The pepperoni tasted like nasty processed Hormel pepperoni you can get from the grocery store. In fact, I'd rather eat that stuff. The cheese was minimal on the crust and there were small portions of onions, sausage, mushrooms and peppers. The mushrooms on the pizza looked like canned mushrooms. The crust tasted like those microwavable mini pizzas. I ate one slice and boxed the rest to go. I may feed it to my dog, eat it as a desperation lunch or just toss it in the trash. Not sure what decision I'll make yet. Our waitress sucked. Once our order was in, she tended to the other Japanese tourists, and left us without saying a word. She also did something weird, which was stuff her body between our small tables (they are very close in the back side) facing her butt towards our plates and food. Gross. Of course if you come here you got to have the cheesecake. I ordered strawberry cheesecake to go. It was alright. I've had better elsewhere.

911,samantha e.,"Honolulu, HI",1,8,3.0,3.0,2014-04-30,"Today I had lunch at the Cheesecake Factory on Oahu for the first time. I was so excited because I heard so many great things about it and I was going to be able to experience it first hand, well it wasn't what I was expecting. I went with my nieces Sammy and Hue and my nephew Tristin. Sammy and Hua have been to the Restaurant before and just loved it. Sammy had the Chicken Madeira Hua and I we...nt with the Fettuccini Alfredo and Tristin had a plain charbroiled Hamburger. Sammy and Tristin's food was great Hua and I not so great. The Alfredo was extremely salty we just could not eat it so we sent it back. We got two new orders a little bit better but still to salty Hua sent hers back I decide to try and eat mine and asked for more bread to help cover the saltiness. Bread, water, even bear could not cover the saltiness. The reason I am writing this is because even though my first experience was not very good I am willing to give it one more try because of how we were treated. When we sent back the first order Wayne (sorry did not get last name) came to our table and apologized and explained what they though might have been the problem and reassured us a new order would be out shortly. Wayne was apologetic, he empathized and really showed that they care about there customers. He offered to bring out complementary drinks or food to make up for the problem. The second time he came out to talk to us again nothing but professionalism. That is the reason I will give it another try I really believe that statements made that it is the bomb is true and this was just a fluke. One comment maybe Wayne should spend some time with the waitress Tammie she needs a little help in being more attentive to her customer even if it is an 8 year old. she was good at letting wayne know about what happened with the food we sent back, but that was about it!! she would ask a question but we never finished asking while she just walked away from us. I watched as she helped other customers and i did not see her treating them this way, she looked like she was conversating with other customers but just very vauge with us, maybe because we were ""locals"" i dont know what her problem was, but she really needs to treat customers the way she would want to be treated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=800,3.12,3.61,3.656,3.1160000000000005,3.414

(Welcome to my world.)  Yes, like many of the previous reviews I had been to numerous Cheesecake Factory outlets . ( Redondo Beach;Pasadena ;Beverly Hills)   It is however unfair to make comparisons , you see this is Hawaii where you should leave your expectations at the airport counter and just have a good time and enjoy where you are ,paradise it's not too hard .. I have been doing it for 10 years  That's how long we have been coming here. ( some voices have come and gone but,needless to say they are still multiple) Yes, there will be a wait,after all this is the busiest restaurant in ALL of Hawaii . Stop whining about it . It's either you want to be here or you don't . Stop complaining about the wait,come when they open the wait will be minimal.(see how easy the remedy to your conundrum was.) There's got to be more to your lives than to leave miserable & frankly mean spirited reviews for this place,consider this facts. Over 100+ employees at a given shift ; 2000+ meals a day served those are staggering numbers for any restaurant operations . Yet , selfish as we all are we want perfection , our excuse is that we are customers & we are paying for it .... That's not an excuse to be rude & belligerent to other humans. Yes, that was you we are talking about. So let it go already .  Here's the scoop . We have had excellent service to mediocre service. We have had superb food to meh food. But , we keep coming back !!! Why you may ask? We think the Cheesecake Factory is just like us ... With multiple personalities .  There will be good days and they will be bad days. It does not matter what Rx you have been ingesting...in the end it will always be that....multiple personalities. Just accept it . As they say acceptance is the hardest pill  to swallow .

The parsley was wilted and dried out on the plate.  When I started eating my mashed potatoes that came with the meatloaf I noticed something hard in it.  When I spit it out I found a piece of hard plastic in it.  I called for the manager and Marshall didn't want to talk about how long it took for us to get our meals but he talked loudly so everyone around us could hear that he would handle the mater of the plastic in the food.  When we decided that we just wanted to leave we looked around for the waiter and he was no where to be found.  I did see him laughing away in the kitchen area but he would not return to the tables.  I finally decided to get our check from the manager and then there was a wait again for the waiter to get our payment so we could leave.  This restaurant has really gone downhill.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1400,3.44,3.46,3.636,2.9800000000000004,3.4520000000000004

It was full of each ingredient and perfectly balanced, I will attempt to replicate. After our meals and being new to this Cheesecake Factory serving size thing, we ordered just two. I say that in jest as one would have been enough. We had the OREO® Dream Extreme Cheesecake and the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle. Both were lovely and enjoyed by all three of us.

877,Harriet O.,"Fresno, CA",2,12,3.0,3.0,2014-07-21,"Food was consistent with the rest of the chain. We had a large party and the manager immediately introduced himself and gave us our seating options. We were sat quickly and in a beautiful area of the restaurant, near the fountain in the back with a garden view. Service (server) was great and gave us insider tips about visiting Oahu which was nice.  What the manager didn't know was that my dad is a veteran and was meeting his military buddy that he had not seen since the 1960's. It was an important night. Like I said, service was great (our main server), they were busy...drinks (not necessarily brought by server) were quite slow, but other than that - good.  However - the manager, initially friendly, was overheard by a member of our party (as they were heading to the restroom near the host station), ""They've been here for 2 hours, hopefully they'll be leaving soon."" After this was said, he walked to our table and took our silverware and napkins away, stating, ""Just helping clean up here!"" Then came back a few minutes later to stand against the wall near our table (about 6-8 ft. away) and stared at us, until we basically felt pressured to leave. The funny thing was, a lot of that time was spent waiting for drinks, salads, dinner and dessert. We weren't there long after the service was complete. Everyone in our party was trying not to rush my dad and his friend's reunion. Maybe I should have said something to the manager, I know he was just doing his job... It was a little disconcerting, it seemed that the focus was on numbers and not customer service.

I'm guessing this place isn't a 5 star establishment because of the long lines and the location. Us locals usually dread going into Waikiki because everything is so touristy crowded, and over priced. Aside from that, i love it here.  I get the salmon, either herb crusted or miso, its always a toss up, they're both so good! And i've recently discovered the steak diane and shrimp combo. #toodiefor Its really good, and a generous portion. But too much if you are trying to save room for dessert.

You're literally feet away from one of the world's most famous beaches, yet Cheesecake Factory doesn't even have an ocean view. They offer mediocre American food at high prices. If you want to pay this much for food, you should at least go somewhere with a view. Maybe the kitchen fire a couple years ago made this some kind of weird special attraction. No, that can't be it. Obviously these people don't use yelp to find better restaurants in waikiki (I know, it can be hard).  Ok, I get that their cheesecake is good. That's pretty much where I draw the line though. I wouldn't come back for anything but the cheesecake. And even when I do come back to pick up cheesecake, there's always a line at the counter and the cashiers are rude.  This place will always be busy (unless they try to burn down the building again) because they're so centrally located in waikiki and people passing by just can't help themselves.

1365,Shannon G.,"Honolulu, HI",0,4,,3.0,2014-07-26,"We have been to this particular location two separate occasions. The first time we ordered three main entrees; the Chicken Madeira, the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo, and the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. The Madeira is touted as the most popular chicken dish, however is was only ok in my opinion. It was not bad, but also not fantastic. The gumbo was ok, and the pepper shrimp was just so-so. The second time the Factory Burrito Grande and the Skinnylicious Asian Salad was ordered. The burrito was decent, and the salad was quite good. The only part of the salad I did not care for was the rice noodles.    On the positive side of things the service was good and the bread they bring you before the meal is very good. It also has the added benefit of keeping away the grumbles as you wait for your entree.    There are several issues you may want to keep in mind if you are thinking of venturing to this location. The first being the wait. Do not be surprised if they tell you the wait is over an hour. It is a busy restaurant in a tourist location. Second, their menu can be quite overwhelming. It is too large and can take a person quite a bit of time just to go over their dinner options. I think that they could benefit trimming down the amount of dishes they offer, but since they are already an established chain I doubt that will happen. The lighting is also very dim in there. It's quite dark for a restaurant. Also, if you are ordering for kids, they put a lot of pepper on the vegetables. The carrots were too spicy for a kids menu item, so you may want to request no pepper for the little ones.   Overall the experience was fine, but nothing special. It is the same as any other Cheesecake Factory. If that's what you're looking for, you got it! If the wait is more than 30 minutes it is probably worth trying something else, unless you came for the desserts in particular. The desserts are quite good, but can be very rich so take your time! There is a separate line and checkout for purchasing cheesecakes togo, so if you only want one of those you can get one without waiting for a table. It was a convenient location for us since it was right next to the hotel. We were able to put our name in to wait and then go back to our room for the hour they quoted us. If we had to sit at the restaurant and wait over an hour, we would not have stayed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1200,3.56,3.45,3.628,2.7640000000000002,3.494

Even if you don't love cheesecake, you still need to come here!! =) First of all, The Cheesecake Factory is located along the infamous Waikiki Strip on Kalakaua Avenue in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center. Parking is free in the shopping center as long as you get your ticket validated at the reception desk. For those of you who have never eaten at a Cheesecake Factory, there is more to this restaurant than just cheesecake... SO MUCH MORE!! Their huge menu is one of the largest I have seen for any given restaurant, which makes it both a blessing and a curse... I certainly love their wide variety of selections, but it also makes it very difficult to choose!! And don't expect to get seated right away at this Waikiki location... It is almost always extremely busy, and you would be considered really lucky if your wait is less than 30 minutes. Probably the best times to go are weekdays during lunch. Dinners and weekends are definitely the busiest. But being that busy just shows you that there's something good in store for you inside. Like I said earlier, the menu is FRICKEN HUGE!! So determining what to actually eat might take awhile. But whatever you decide to order, I can guarantee you that it will be a hearty portion!! I almost always have a problem with not finishing my food, and that's not even counting the dessert!! I have eaten at this particular Cheesecake Factory at least a dozen times, and normally I get my usuals... Crispy Crab Wontons and the Miso Salmon... Both, in my opinion, are exceptional dishes and I have never been disappointed by ordering them at this restaurant or any Cheesecake Factory restaurant for that matter!! I haven't really tried anything else, except occasionally tasting some of my friends dishes, but anything you order is pretty much going to be good and have good portions. And finally, THE DESSERT!! I absolutely love cheesecake and always have a problem choosing one from their three dozen selections they have on hand... AND THAT'S JUST THE CHEESECAKE!! For you non-cheesecake lovers, they also have different cakes and ice creams to choose from. I'm normally too stuffed by the end of my regular meal, so I get dessert to go. So if you're willing to wait to be seated, The Cheescake Factory really does have something for everybody, and not just cheesecake!! =)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=640,3.52,3.45,3.628,2.8640000000000003,3.478

It was hot, so when we sat down, we were happy when she said she'd be right back with bread & water. She came back, with nothing, and took our dink orders. She then finally came back after another wait with our drinks and bread (still no water). We then had to wait around for an unusually long time for our order, and then again for the bill.

I mean the wait time was an hour and a half to 2 hours long! They said the best time to come was either before 5:30 pm or after 9:30 pm. I came in around 9:30 pm and they said it was only 20 minutes. That was fine considering there were many stores around that I could check out while I waited.  The atmosphere...set the mood the the restaurant. The music was a little loud when you first walk in, so you couldn't really hear the hostesses. But getting to your table the music kind of died down a little. The lighting of the restaurant was dimmed all around with the tables having their own lights shown on then.  The menu...was crazy! 21 pages of over 200 different varieties of items to choose from! I really don't know how the server would remember all of that. But apparently she told me that they have an excellent training program.  The food...was pretty good but not what I expected. I ordered the filet mignon, which is one of my favorite steaks. Normally the filet is suppose to be a lean cut of steak with no fat to it, just all meat. But the one here is the first ever filet that I've found some fat in. I mean it was good, but it could've been better without the fat.  For desert, I was suggested either the banana cream cheesecake or the key lime cheesecake. I ordered the banana cream and it was amazing! I'd say that one cheesecake is enough for one to two people. So if you order, try and get different types and share! They are known for their cheesecakes after all.  The value...of my food could've been better. Typically the price of a filet is around $29.95 - $32.95. I dint think that it was with it for the filet, however, the Cheesecake was amazing! And the value of my service was excellent! My server was Olivia and she really knew her stuff. She was very attentive and made sure all her tables got what they needed. She answered many of the questions that I had about the menu and that really impressed me since there are a lot of options on there. And congratulations to her! She is due to give birth in 6 weeks!  As I was leaving the restaurant I spoke with one of the managers named Bryan and told him about my experience. He was also very knowledgeable about the restaurant. He gave me some good tips about how to be successful in opening up your own restaurant.  Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant. But if you do decide to go, go in either before 5:30 pm or after 9:30 pm.

I got the wild blueberry white chocolate cheesecake which is my all time favorite.  I really goes well with the blueberry mojito I must say.  Our whole time spent there was about 4 hours total.  We got out right around 9:30PM.  Some side notes, in regards to location, you can't really miss Cheesecake Factory, there will always be people waiting around the restaurant and it's within the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Plaza area.  They really have the ambiance set low when dining in especially at night, you will need a flashlight to browse through the menu.  I don't like how they don't have prices listed specifically for certain things like the individual cocktails and cheesecakes.  Coming into here reminds me of Liliha Bakery, you also have to wait and there's always a crowd for cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=780,3.64,3.5,3.54,3.308,3.5560000000000005

It was the middle of the afternoon and my husband and I wanted to sit down somewhere to grab a bite.  You can never go wrong with CF so we put our name down.  The wait wasn't too long - about 20 minutes or so.  We were given a pager for when our table was ready.  The good part is CF is smack in the middle of the shopping area so you can go inside the neighboring stores while your partner (haha) waits outside so you're still within the radio frequency! We decided to order just one kalua pig pizza as again, we weren't really hungry and just wanted to rest.  We decided on this pizza because we hadn't seen it on any other CF menu we've eaten at and was the most 'hawaiian' one there - except for the obvious Hawaiian pizza of course, but you can get that anywhere. The pizza was a perfect small-ish size for us!  I love any slow roasted pork on anything.  This one was nicely salted with red onions and little pieces of sweet mango!  Nice addition.  Would definitely recommend this pizza to others.

We chose to go for Saturday lunch right at noon in hopes of beating the rush.... we luckily did and got a lovely booth in the back where it was quiet and we had a view out an open window. I decided since it was the weekend (and almost time for vacation) to treat myself to a couple bloody Mary's. They were actually very good; super spicy & just enough booze kick. Zing, good morning! ;) My boyfriend and I both went with lunch specials. I think people need to remember what great desks they are - good prices & lunch size portions and combos from the regular menu. My man went with Renees Special - salad, 1/2 chicken-almond salad sandwich (or fresh turkey) and a bowl of soup of the the day, which happened to be baked potato. I went with the pizza & salad combo, the Portofino pizza sounded right up my alley at that moment. You can pay $1 to upgrade your salad to ceasar PS. My pizza had basil almond pesto, grilled chicken, calabrian peppers & three different cheeses. Fresh & toasty delicious! My garden salad had a really beautiful light dressing & lots of tomato. Boyfriends caesar was classic; the almond-chicken salad sandwich was way bigger than expected & on buttered toast that was mouthwatering by itself. The baked potato soup was extremely creamy & tasty with lots of chunky potato and crumbed bacon. You knew it had to be high calorie but you couldn't stop licking the spoon. We were both very satisfied and at a good price. We had to finish off the meal with cheesecake of course so we went with chocolate chip cookie dough. NOMNOMNOM!! We had great service and our waitress was friendly. She was obviously well trained. This wasn't a five star dining experience but we had a lovely tasty meal in Waikiki without feeling totally like a tourist without breaking the bank.

My salad could've fed 3 or 4 people. My only gripe is there was hardly any chicken in it! For $19 I would at least expect 4-6oz of it. That kind of bummed me out. I've had this salad at other locations and it was generous.  Couldn't eat all greens, I dug through it thinking there was chicken in the bottom. ZERO! Oh well.  My hubby's burger was good but he gave it a 7 out of 10. He's a burger lover. Says his fav is Five Guys (you can adjust your scale from there).  We ordered the Lemon meringue cheesecake.

430,Vince N.,"Maui County, HI",420,1467,5807.0,3.0,2015-01-05,"Sigh.  Here comes the truth.  After years of eating at TCF, I'm beginning to realize that while they make A LOT of food, and give enormous amounts, it's also not the best tasting, though a few dishes still rock my boat.  ATMOSPHERE: Busy and noisy.  This is the highest-grossing CF in the USA.  Seating capacity is big.  There's 2 outdoor lanais, big bar, and bakery counter.  FOOD: Caesar Salad - The appetizer portion was huge and big enough for two, comfortably for three to share.  Pretty to look at, but the dressing was too tangy for me.  CPK does a better job.  Fried Mac & Cheese - Anything deep fried is awesome right?  Big breaded balls of mac & cheese over a marinara sauce.  This is an app but is huge!  Make sure you can share or devour a lot. Ahi Carpaccio - Super thin ahi with a wasabi pesto drizzle (couldn't taste the wasabi which is awesome to me,) sliced avocado and a togarashi aioli for dipping.  Taste was great but the thin slices results in a plate looking like a fish autopsy after trying to pick out your portion. Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo - This is my ultimate favorite dish here.  I absolutely LOVE gumbo, and I love rice.  It's like a chunky soup, full of flavor with a kick.   Chicken Marsala - The chicken was tender and the mushrooms plentiful, but the sauce is way too sweet for me.  It comes with bow tie pasta.  I once substituted the bow ties for linguine - boy was that a big mistake.  They put nearly 1/2 pound of pasta on the plate with the same minuscule amount of sauce on the normal dish.   Chicken Madeira - This dish is better than the marsala IMO because it has more depth than the overly sweet marsala.  Comes with mashed potatoes.  Pasta Carbonara - The ratio of spaghettini pasta to sauce was 70% pasta, 30% sauce which resulted in a very bland dish.   Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - The linguine was al dente and the chicken and shrimp plentiful, but overall very underwhelming.  CPK does a way better version.  Salisbury Steak - Great flavor with a nice crunchy exterior.  Mashed potatoes were okay but could've used some flavor (or a more generous amount of gravy.)  To my local peeps, it's a hamburger steak but formed into the shape of a steak instead of round patties. Bistro Shrimp Pasta - I had high hopes for this 1,900 calorie dish.  What a disappointment!  The breading of the shrimp had the consistency of breakfast potatoes, and fell off the shrimp in chunks.  The shrimp had no flavor.  Not being not a fan of arugula, I couldn't taste them, thankfully.  The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, and that was the only highlight. Shrimp Scampi & Steak Diane Combo - After seeing pics of this, I had to try it.  I thought the scampi came with pasta underneath but didn't.  The 3 shrimp were deep fried and nicely seasoned in a tomato-onion drizzle.  The steak was tender and tasty, in a slightly sweet brown sauce and topped with a few mushrooms.  A wall of mashed potatoes separated the two down the middle.  Highly recommended.  DESSERT: Red Velvet Cheesecake - It looks awesome in the pic, but I didn't care for the taste of cheesecake together with red velvet cake.  I prefer them separate.  Strawberry Shortcake - Not too sweet which is great. Banana Cream Cheesecake - Bananas + cheesecake = OMG. Strawberry Cheesecake - Same as the banana verdict. Original Cheesecake - My boring favorite!  Super light and creamy.  Unbelievable! SERVICE: They do not take reservations.  Be prepared to wait up to 2 hours on weekend nights.  The staff are friendly, even in the most hectic of environments.  We recently had Darren F as a server.  What a super friendly, smiley, and professional guy!  Good deal! TIP: Avoid the crowds by coming for lunch or late night since they're open till midnight.  OVERALL: Generous portions, some subpar selections, weak pasta dishes, but they do have the best cheesecakes around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=280,3.44,3.5,3.56,2.8920000000000003,3.4760000000000004

Tourists pack this place as well as locals.  If you don't mind waiting for 1 hour and a half and have patience  like a saint then do come and join the chaos. The decor is like an old nostalgic museum and oh soooo dark. We had to look at our menu with our cell phone.  Staff is nice as can be, given their working condition.  Atmosphere is oh so hectic and crazy. Not at all relaxing. Not at all surprised, it's Waikiki.  After waiting for soooo long for a table, we finally got buzzed and was so famished, we couldn't wait to eat. Our tables was near vents and it was soooo cold, brrrrr. It was so cold it was miserable. Dare not to ask for another table because didn't want to wait another 2 hours.  We were served bread that was soo hard and stale but ate it anyway because we were so hungry. We did let the server know it was hard and stale and she did bring us out another set of bread. The second one was very soft and not at all stale, but we were already full from the first set of bread.  Soup of the day was potato soup and boy it was good. I don't know if it was we were famished or not but it looked and tasted very good. 5 stars.  Shrimp thai rolls was very tasy and good, there was 2 sauces, peanut and a sweeter sauce and they both complimented shrimp roll very well.  Teriyaki steak was a bit to sweet, not your authentic teriyaki, it was just ok. It was so busy I didn't realize they forgot the asparagus tempura that comes wiith the teriyaki dish. It was chaos and I just wanted to get out of there.  Combination steak diane and salmon was average and nothing out of the ordinary.  Combination steak diane and shrimp was tasy and generic.  Salad was just ok.  The best part was the chocolate cheescake. 5 stars.  The wait here was crazy insane but what to expect in Waikiki.

Now I'm currently writing this review as I'm waiting for the bill to come. It's taking that long!  Food: made the mistake of ordering the luau salad. I regret it. It was overdressed and super oily.

But my coworker wanted to have a drink with me. I got this, and it wasn't too strong and very sweet (just how I like my alcohol). The only downfall was that it was too dark.

1217,Brian N.,"Richmond, Canada",0,8,,2.0,2015-05-06,"I've been to a few different Cheesecake Factories and they provide a consistent experience.   It's a popular food chain but has an extensive, varied menu.  Last time I dined there, I decided to go light since their portions are large.  I ordered the Endive Pecan Blue Cheese salad and an order of Buffalo Wings to share.  The wings came first and they looked amazing.  They had a nice dry rub on them as opposed to the overly saucy wings you get at some places.  They tasted good until I got into my second wing and noticed my lips and throat burning but it wasn't from the hot sauce.  It was a pure sodium burn, these wings were so salty!  I asked my wife to try one and she agreed that they were way too salty.  I told the waiter about them and asked if by mistake the cook put too much salt on them.  He said they were all done the same and shouldn't be any saltier than any other batch.  I couldn't eat any more of them and he agreed to take them off the bill.  When I got back to my hotel, I looked up the nutritional chart for the wings and it stated 4420mg of sodium (over twice the daily recommended maximum intake of sodium).  No wonder.  I don't know why restaurants feel they have to over-salt most items.  I understand a reasonable amount of seasoning makes food taste better but this is just overkill.  I had to drink a gallon of water just to flush out the sodium from a couple of wings. On a good note, the endive salad and my wife's advocado spring rolls were quite tasty.  As well, the original cheesecake was very good (we also tried the Hershey bar cheesecake but the enjoyment was distracted by the amount of chocolate chips and cake in the dessert). Advice to restaurants, cut down on the sodium and try to rely on quality foods to attract customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1080,4.08,3.68,3.556,2.9200000000000004,3.8400000000000003

Started with the fried avocado spring roll appetizer as directed by the daughter.  She loves these things.  Very fresh and generous serving of avocado in a deep fried spring roll wrapper served with a cilantro  dipping sauce that is reminiscent of chimmichuri but is sweet.  Different but delicious.   She had the chicken scallopini which was very flavorful  with a nice overlay of lemon.  The hubs had Steak Diane which was wonderful...tender steak encrusted with peppercorns and a Madera sauce that was generously served but light in consistency.  it was nice that there was enough gravy to sop up with the mash potatos or the bread assortment they serve. The tenderness and flavor of the steak was truly surprising and rivals a steak served at any high end steak house.  I had the seafood chowder and there was an assortment of seafood in a thick New England style chowder.  Very filling.  We were too stuffed to eat dessert so Cody talked us into cheesecake slices to go.

515,Jeannie G.,"Jersey City, NJ",28,98,1215.0,4.0,2015-05-13,"Cheesecake Factory never fails! #1 reason why we came here on a Friday after 5pm-we were missing the CF back on the mainland and despite it's tourist magnet location, we said what the heck-their food is worth it. Some tips: DINING for 2: Head straight for the BAR area. Self-serve seating! As soon as you see an empty table grab it and plop your behind down! There service is quite attentive and someone will catch your eye and drop some menus. I'd pass on the heavy wait at a regular table unless ur with a group-there are always ppl waitin swampin the entrance.  AMBIANCE: Huh?! What did you say?! Yes! It's loud in there. Of course mainly bc of the volume and traffic of people. But who comes to Cheesecake Factory anyway to have a ""quiet candlelight"" dinner. The lighting is pretty dim though. Better have ur phone flashlight handy.  DRINKS: Hubz ordered a Manhattan straight-up (for you hardcore drinkers, u know how tuff it tastes). Waiter was on top of his drinking game and new his liquor well. Was well made with Bourbon, Vermouth and all. Don't forget the cherry! I had some Tropical martini. Came straight up with a cute orchid flower in it-not cough syrup tasting at all. Thumbs up! FOOD: APPS: First off, they serve you warm yummy bread-and that brown loaf with the oats is bomb by itself! Try not to fill up on it even though it is bottomless. 1st up. Can't go wrong with there ""Fried Mac-N-Cheese""! Comes in 4 tennis ball sized pieces, breaded outside toped with sauce, slice down the middle and watch the cheese ooze right out.  Yah better dip that bread all up in der. Mmmm! MAIN: Tried there newest ""Harvest Salad""-recommended by our waiter. Was divine! Refreshing-arugula was not heavy and too crunchy like how romaine lettuce could be. The edamame and pine nuts added texture. And the slices of parm cheese added juss a perfect amt of salt. Even took the rest home! This was a half portion! Hubz ordered the ""Smokehouse Burger""-also recommended by our waiter. Size was not impressive, was cooked as asked, seasoned well, and the BBQ sauce was not too sweet. He enjoyed it! DESSERT: Sad to say, they no longer have one of my favs-""Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake"" so we shot to try another recommendation from our waiter and tried the ""Tuxedo""-and I'm glad we did. It was  chocolate goodness all over! The ganache, fudge, and mascarpone cheese-heaven! Also we ordered a classic, the ""Strawberry"" cheesecake, gotta love that graham cracker crust and large fresh strawberries. Mmm.. WRAP IT UP: Would we be back?! For sure, wouldn't make it a regular spot but CF has always delivered on their food. Always satisfied. One more note-their menus differ a bit fr mainland in that it doesn't have the mini plates/tapas at the front of the menu (addtl 2-3pgs) and a few other items but thats fine bc were in Hawaii and the special is not ""Mahi Mahi"" like it always was back in the mainland lol.

Fast Forward 5 mins and I kid you not the same waiter is there running after my partner and I and had come to tell us for future reference the tip isn't included in the bill. I find that very rude unprofessional and very embarrassing on the cheesecake factory's behalf. Firstly, I understand employees work on minimum wage but it is up to the customer wether or not they are satisfied enough with the service to give you a tip or not. Secondly, It's not the customers responsibility to pay your wages so it's not fair to assume it is your right to expect a tip no matter what from no matter who.

I had been craving a steak for a few days when a friend of mine suggested we grab lunch at Cheesecake factory. I figured the craving could just be put aside for a calorie bomb cheeseacke.  But HOLD THE PHONE the menu here is so extensive that they actually have several steaks on it! omgomgomg! I decided on the grilled ribeye (rare) because I figured go big or go home. In order to be somewhat health-conscious I switched out french fries for steamed broccoli and was actually really happy that I did. I didn't need the carbs to make me feel full after putting away the entire steak and veggies. (Although I did eat the free bread that came to the table so I did have some carbs...) I dipped my broccoli into my steak juice for extra flavor because it's seriously just steamed (no seasoning even I think) I was so full that I didn't even get any cheesecake.

All the times I've eaten here have only been their opening hours and I like it that way.  On my recent visit the Hostess took us to what I thought was 'the Dungeon'. I don't know why she thought that four women, three of which have poor eye sight, would be fine sitting in a round corner booth with barely any light. Sure some may think that dimming lights make for an 'Intimate Experience'...blah! Not here! It does not look classy to see ladies pulling out their phones to use the flashlight to read the menu! Even after asking the waitress if they could brighten up the lights in the corner or if they had any glasses that had an LED light, she sadly replied that the restaurant can't change the lights and no light reading glasses. For this lack of light set us 10min more into searching into 'The Cheesecake Factory Menu Book' for our Lunch.  Appetizers to try:  Crab & Artichoke Dip! Yes, everyone should try this dip that will not only make you moan because of the taste, but will feed four people very well! We attacked the toasted bread slices, which weren't that much, and the squaw & Italian bread with the crab and artichoke dip! Even after the toasted slices were eaten, we began asking for a second helping of warm bread to place the dip in between and have a nice crab sandwich - which I also recommend trying!  Soup of the Day: when I ordered my Renee's lunch special (chicken and almond salad sandwich with a small baby green salad with blue cheese dressing and a bowl of soup); the soup which was called, ""Spicy Mexican Chicken Soup with cheese and crispy tortilla strips"". This is must try! The closest to this soup in taste is at Chili's - but this clearly out bests Chili's. After one spoonful and I ate the whole bowl of soup before I even touched my salad and sandwich! The soup was very tasty, the Spicy - meaning full of spices because it wasn't hot in rector scale but pipping hot in temperature. This soup can be eaten on a cool Fall evening on a porch staring out into the sunset! Yes, I would definitely go back just for the soup!  Entrees to try that will make you content -  Fish & Chips Factory Meatloaf  Fettuccine Alfredo  Renee's Lunch Special And of course the cheesecake! Though I'll let you decide which is your favorite!

First they don't have the ""skinnylicious"" menu in Hawaii so don't come here if you like to watch unnecessary calories. (And I know in their regular menu they make dishes with unnecessary calories) Second I ordered the herb lemon roasted chicken and 10 minutes later the manager comes to tell me that they can't serve me that because the chicken wasn't cooked or something. She hands me a menu to order something new and my waiter had no idea and was baffled when I went to order the Parmesan- crusted chicken.  Third- my husband wants to order a torte and I asked for a side of raspberries since I love fresh fruit with whipped cream. They don't have rasberries!

Bad food and a bad waitress.  We waited at the bar and got drinks and an app. The bartender was great. When we got our table, we immediately ordered. 20 min go by and the waitress says, ""I just checked on your food and it will be just a couple of more minutes."" 20 more minutes until we finally get our food. In the mean time, a couple who sat down 30 min after us got their food. When we did get our food, the items ranged from cold to luke warm. The plates obviously sat in the window. The butter wasnt melting on my mashed potatoes because they werent hot. My hubby's plate was missing his tempura asparagus and his food was cold too.  When he notified the waitress to tell her about the missing food, she said she knew but she never mentioned anything about the missing food when she dropped our plates. Nor did she tell him the asparagus was coming. My hubby asked her to take the plate back and he didn't want a replacement. She left with a sour look on her face.  Manager Marshall came to us within 5 min and was very cordial. He attempted to make it right and comped both of our entrees. My hubby was over it and refused another plate. Marshall asked if it was ok for our server to come back to us and we agreed.  However, a different server came to finish our meal until it was time for the check.  He was nice and I started to feel better about the night although my man was still upset. Then the original server came back and she did not offer an apology. In fact, she slammed the check down with a mumbled ""thank you"" and ran away.  I deliberately left her zero tip. My man is currently a server and I was a server throughout college. Her behavior was unacceptable. The manager and second server made a good attempt at service recovery for her screw up but her sour attitude ruined it.  Total 2 hour wait for our entrees, one of which we sent back. Not worth it.

The manager came because he heard all the commotion and plates falling, etc. sodas toppled over, two people had wet attire and one meal ruined. The manager had the meal that was ruined replaced.

890,Brooke O.,"Honolulu, HI",0,32,,3.0,2015-07-09,"I've never been to this place, not until my niece took me a few weeks ago. Now I can say I've been twice.  The first time I went it was so packed with a long, very long line outside, it reminded me of waiting to get into a concert...it was ridiculous. As I waited for my niece to arrive I could hear people talking about the wait being at least two hours. I'm thinking it's 8p.m, by the time we sit down it will be 10p! I ain't down for supper, I want dinner. My niece is late - YAY!!  Here she comes, 830p. and it's like a movie star entering the crowd where everyone stands back to get a good look. My niece is beautiful. I tell her, ""we won't get a seat until midnight!"", she says, ""don't worry aunty, our table is ready."" She takes my hand and we walk past everyone to the very front and this lovely girl ask my niece how many, she says two and we get seated by the window...just like that. This seems to be her life tho, never waiting, always getting serviced right away.  The place is LOUD, did I say, ""LOUD!"". You can't hardly hear each other above it all and the tables are so close together we could reach over and eat from the other peoples plates. I thought about doing just that because everything looked sooo delicious. The menu is outrageous, overwhelming and kinda stupid. Why would anyone need so many choices? It's like 12 pages and maybe more and reading it is like reading a bedtime book. In the meantime the waiter keeps asking if we're ready like every five minutes when we're still on page one. It's super loud, people breathing on us from every angle, the place is dark, a menu like a long drawn out never ending book and a very large woman coughing like crazy with no effort whatsoever to cover her nasty germs flying out of her mouth...this first experience isn't really a good one thus far.  I decide on biscuits and gravy w/fried chicken, only because it's the only thing I've really ever heard people talk about and it always sounds so ono. Guess what?? Yeap, they are ""OUT"" of it, ha! So I order the fried chicken sliders w/a side of french fries and a side of mash potatoes...I don't know why, but yea, I ordered a side of mash and a hot mocha coffee. My niece orders some kind of raw fish plate. I don't do raw meats. She also orders a dip, I'm sorry, I cannot recall which one, but it was good. After dinner I order Linda's Fudge Cake and it was excellent! My entire dinner was very good, I really enjoyed it. I took home for my husband the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich which he also enjoyed even though he didn't eat it until the next evening. I especially enjoyed the molasses bread and took some of that home too, but for my dinner the next evening, hehe. As far a my nieces food, I can't really say if she liked it as she hardly likes any food and rarely ever touches it.  Would I go back? My first experience was an adventure indeed. I don't like loud places, especially while I'm out to dinner, nor do I like people right up on me, but the food was good and I love hanging out with my niece...so if she wanted to go again, yes, I'd venture out at least once more.

Once seated the service was superb, the waiter was great at making sure we never went thirsty, the appetizers came out quickly and tasted great. The main course took a little bit longer  which was expected due to the volume of customers. The managers came by to apologize and ensure our meals came shortly after that.

476,Chris L.,"Mililani, HI",66,161,190.0,5.0,2015-07-14,"There are very few places where you can get there at just after 5pm and already have a 50 minute wait, there are fewer places where I would say ""yes"" to a 50 minute wait and where the reaction to a 50 minute wait is ""Oh, that's not bad."" and there is only one place that I know of on the island where the hostess will tell a party leader that the wait is now 3 hours and they'll still happily accept it. That place is ""The Cheesecake Factory""  The Cheesecake Factory has been a destination for my family for years now, I used to have them take me here on my birthday. Now days though we seldom get the chance to go because of distance and parking and the nighttime craziness that is Waikiki in general, anywho lets break this down into categories again.  Hostess/Front desk  I'm giving this its own category in this review simply because of how much time you are likely to spend here. The wait times I've witnessed have been anywhere from 45 minutes to 3 hours depending on the time and day. If you really want to try and avoid the wait you need to come in the 3-5pm hours and even then you'll likely be handed a 20-50 minute wait anyway.  The people at the front desk do their best to accommodate everyone but please, please keep in mind that these people get swamped all at once by people who speak a variety of languages, there are only 3 to 5 people at that desk for hundreds of people trying to check in, check out, validate parking ect. They will be sluggish occasionally but yelling at them about it will only make their day worse and the wait longer for everyone else so PLEASE SHOW UNDERSTANDING AND RESPECT while you are waiting so everyone can run through as quickly as possible.  If you get to the Cheesecake Factory too late you might be faced with a line, this line will exit the restaurant and nearly hit the street, in my experience at this point your wait will likely be over an hour.  They will occasionally run out of pagers too.  One final thing is that due to how many people there are you can help the line a lot by only sending up one person from your party to wait in line, seriously, like you have no idea how much of a difference that will make with people trying to exit the restaurant with strollers and such.  Interior and Cleanliness I tend to trust restaurants that allow you to see inside their kitchen, they aren't afraid of showing you what they are doing because they know they have nothing to hide.  On the inside you have a very sophisticated feeling space, it's dimly lit with ""marble"" table tops and rich woods, very well maintained especially considering the amount of people through the space in any given hour.  Service The service here is great, we only had one issue where our server very clearly and specifically asked if my father wanted his soup before or with the main courses and my father very clearly and specifically said he wanted it before hand. The server then said he would get it right away and left.  We didn't get it until the main courses came at which point my father sent it back because it was too much food at once, which was a shame, that soup smelled really good.  Food With the amount of food delivered to our table I only tried 3 items personally and I only remember the names of 2 of them.  The Bacon-bacon Burger (Pictured) : Well cooked with a very nice toasted bun, crossed with bacon and served with the lettuce and such on the side so you can choose if you want it or not. It was spot on, solid 5 star dish  The everything Pizza (Not Pictured): The dough on their Pizzas is really flavorful and the fresh ingredients pop. The meats had a smokey flavoring to it that was just amazing, complemented nicely by the cheese.  Crab. . .something. . .crispy Won-tons (Pictured): Yeah, this is the one that I forgot the name for, but these are great. The crab is so creamy and the sauce works well to complete the taste.  All in all due to the experiences we've had over the years I will give The Cheesecake Factory 5 stars despite the issue with the soup, my reason for this is because since we've been coming here that has been the only issue we've had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=320,3.68,3.72,3.6,3.2840000000000003,3.7040000000000006

Shallow them up and spit them out. My meal was not fully cooked and my wife's was smothered in cream it killed any flavour.

Waiter was friendly, loud and clear when he talked with us. He was very detailed on the menu which I appreciated. Complimentary bread came first. Three mini loaves two whole wheat, one sourdough. Warm and fresh. Nothing spectacular. We ordered the Baked Potato Soup, Potstickers and Kobe Steak Burger. Appetizers and Main dish arrived in a timely manner. The Potstickers were ok. They arrive swimming in the dipping sauce with garnish on top. Potstickers were likely steamed and then seared. The filling inside was generous, but wasn't flavorful. The filling was dry, but the sauce compensated. Baked Potato Soup was standard fare. Generous serving, but nothing that punches out the taste buds). We did need to ask that it be heated up. It came to us on the warm-borderline cold side. Kobe Burger was good. I ordered mine medium rare and my wife got a well done. Both were cooked to order. Burger was moist, but the taste was a little overpowered by the sautéed mushroom and onions. It also came with an aioli side which complimented it well. I'd give the burger a 3 out of 5 (McDonald's is a .5 out of 5 for comparison). Tip: low group numbers probably was the advantage of getting seated sooner than later. It was only me and the wife.

Pass this place many times & the long lines scared this local girl away. but hubby wanted to try it so we got into the long line & reached the check in counter at 7:45pm. we were informed that approximate wait time was 1hr 25 minutes. they didn't have those buzzer things (all gone!) so we were told to return at 8:30pm. returned at 8:30pm & was given one, then to be told that I had 45 more minutes of wait time. on a regular day I would be like, screw that, but I was feeling good so OK.  we got buzzed in at 9:15pm & got seated in front of the 2 guy band. songs were OK but personally, they need to jam it up a bit. it was too mellow for a Saturday night. we ordered the bistro shrimp scampi, harvest chicken salad, crispy crab wontons.  complimentary bread while u wait.  the food was very tasty. huge portion so hubby & I shared. service was great, our waitress was nice & attentive although she took awhile to come back around, but we didn't mind. my ONLY complaint... not the wait because I knew after reading the Yelp reviews that we were gonna wait.. my complaint was our B52 shots. It wasn't one. when we got it, I knew the bartender had it wrong because it was COLD. this drink comes in room temperature. it consists of grand marnier, baileys, Kahlua... prepared in that order. I don't know wtf he put in there, it had some type of green chopped something. hubby drank his & almost barffed. I told my waitress of my disappointment. some minutes later the manager came & I told her the shot was made incorrectly & I don't want to pay for it. she apologized & said of course not I won't pay for it. when the bill came in... of course not I did not pay for my shot that I refused to drink, but I was charged for hubby's one. OK I'll pay... but from the bill I knew what the bartender did not put in the shot: grand marnier. for a big & national restaurant, it was very disappointing that their bartendar(s) are not familiar with drinks. lesson learned: I wont order any special drinks not on the menu. other than that. good food experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=520,3.4,3.73,3.6,3.2120000000000006,3.5980000000000003

770,Randall S.,"Kaneohe, HI",19,200,63.0,4.0,2015-09-03,"I admit it...I'm a closet cheesecake addict and for years tend to grade restaurants on how good their cheesecake is.  But to go to a restaurant actually named after my favorite dessert???  I must've died and gone to Heaven!  What's even better is this is a chain!  So I've been to The Cheesecake Factory Restaurants in Seattle and LA but Hawaii's is the best!  (Not to mention the World's Busiest Cheesecake Factory.)  Okay, so what's the bad news?  First, they don't take reservations so it's first come, first serve so you could end up waiting 1- 2 hours before getting seated and it's in Waikiki where parking is a bear.  The good news is they have kick-butt cheesecake!  Oops, need to get back on track...  Situated in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center, you can park in their parking structure so bad news #2 is no longer a problem.  As for the seating, try to go for an early dinner or perhaps lunch when the crowds aren't too bad.  Weekdays are better than weekends for getting tables.  The larger your party is (i.e. more than 4 people), the better an idea it is to go off-schedule.  But once you're seated, be prepared to have your brain explode!  They have an extensive menu offering food for all palates from the simple (burgers on a bun) to more sophisticated dishes (fresh catch of the day like opakapaka).  So it's not possible to not have something that someone doesn't want.  The fresh bread appetizers is a nice thing to munch on while waiting for your food.  Once it comes, I hope you're hungry because these folks provide industrial size servings.  It's a major accomplishment if you can eat all your food without having to take home the leftovers.  But you may want to do that.  Why?  Because you'll have no space for the 5 billion different cheesecake dishes they offer!  Just like their meals, they have peanut butter flavored cheesecake to chocolate cheesecake to just regular cheesecake.  They've taken the humble cheesecake to a whole new level.  Fortunately all is not lost and if you don't have any space, you can always order the cheesecake to be packed to take home.  The servers are always excellent and food and used dishes appear and disappear like magic.  It's not easy to get to the restaurant but I promise is well worth the effort.  Bon Appetit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=620,3.72,3.63,3.588,3.152,3.6660000000000004

458,Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782.0,5.0,2015-09-07,"My parents and I recently went to The Cheesecake Factory for dinner and we encountered the best service yet, in addition to probably our speediest dining experience here ever. Our server--I think his name was Mark--was stellar. Of course, we were there for Sunday for dinner around 5 p.m. and the restaurant was bustling, but he never skipped a beat. He always made sure that our water glasses were full, he packed our bread in a separate to-go container (without us even asking for one), he asked if we wanted our entrees to-go in a timely manner and he was just overall really attentive. He had lots of other parties to wait on, but I was thoroughly impressed by his service.  I also wasn't expecting to get seated so quickly--even though we had a small party--but I think we only had to wait for 5-10 minutes. That was record timing! My parents never deviate too much from our Cheesecake Factory favorites, but everything tasted even better that night because of the great service. Here's what we got: ""Fried Macaroni and Cheese"": This gooey, cheesy mac and cheese mixture gets even better when deep fried and covered with a thin, crispy crumb layer. Cheese simply oozes out of the shell with every bite (truly a must for cheese lovers). The four mac and cheese balls are served with a creamy marinara sauce (not a very strong tomatoey taste) and bits of shredded cheese on top.This dish can be found under the ""Appetizers"" portion of the menu. It's great for sharing if your tablemates love mac and cheese ... or, if you're like me, it's perfect as an entrée because it's just that good.  ""Chicken Madeira"": This chicken dish is famous as the eatery's ""most popular chicken dish."" Flavorful and savory, this one is definitely a winner. The dish contains a couple pieces of tender, sautéed chicken breast topped generously with melted Mozzarella cheese and pieces of asparagus. It's also covered with flavorful mushroom Madeira sauce and is served with fluffy mashed potatoes. Both of my parents usually get this dish; they like it so much that they never want to try anything else! My mom really likes the savory mashed potatoes, and both of my parents enjoy how much cheese and mushrooms top the tender chicken breast.  ""Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple"": This decadent dessert features the original cheesecake in an Oreo Cookie crust and includes caramel, chunks of Butterfingers and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, and peanut butter throughout. My dad always orders this cheesecake, and I always benefit because I can bank on having a bite--or two--while ordering my own cheesecake. Although I've tried several of the different ones on the menu, ""Adam's"" still reigns as one of my favorites. In fact, sometimes both dad AND I order the exact same thing for dessert. He always gets his with coffee, though, since it's really, really sweet. I usually eat mine straight up, and my favorite part is the dollop of creamy peanut butter on top. ""OREO Dream Extreme Cheesecake"": Though I prefer the original version of this cheesecake (and want it to return), I was glad to try this slight rendition. This cheesecake differs from the original OREO one because it includes a layer of moist fudge cake and OREO cookie mousse atop the cheesecake. It's similar to the original in that it has OREO cookies baked into the creamy layer of cheesecake and is topped with a milk chocolate icing. I had mixed feelings about this cheesecake and preferred the original just because I was not a huge fan of the mousse layer (I don't like mousse in general ... nothing against this cheesecake). But, I really liked the layer of moist, fudgy chocolate cake interspersed with the layer of cheesecake (similar to my favorite ""Reese's Peanut Butter"" cheesecake), and the OREO cookie chunks baked into the cheesecake itself is probably my favorite component of the entire dessert. If the mousse layer were eliminated, I would have no problem with this cheesecake being on the menu instead of the original OREO creation. It took some guts for me to deviate from my usual ""Adam's"" or ""Reese's"" cheesecake, but in the end, I was glad that I tried something different.  ""Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake"": My mom decided to get something different in terms of dessert and opted for this Hershey's cheesecake. It's one that we both always wanted to try, but never took a chance on because we always get the same thing. This chocolaty creation features Hershey's cheesecake between moist chocolate cake and comes topped with creamy chocolate frosting and chocolate chips. A true delight for the pure chocoholic! I think I ended up liking this cheesecake more than my mom, who said it was a bit too chocolaty for her. I liked the fact that the cheesecake and chocolate cake were interspersed, so it actually cut down on the sweetness. My mom thought it would have been more effective if the original cheesecake layer was used in between layers of the chocolate cake, and Hershey's bar chunks were inc",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=300,3.72,3.61,3.592,3.22,3.6540000000000004

It was during Labor Day weekend so we knew the wait was gonna be long and both have worked in the fast food industry so we are very understanding. Everyone was really friendly from the host to our server and the managers went above and beyond to make sure everything was okay. We had two managers come out and apologize for the long wait on our foods and assuring us that our food was the first out of a big batch. Sadly when the manager came back around he had to let us know they had accidentally over cooked one of our meals and so happened to be the last chicken they had left. Again I understood stuff like this happens specially on a very busy night. I did not expect a free meal but he did not only take care of my plate but also took care of my husbands and all we had to pay were for the drinks! That's great customer service!

363,Jessica P.,"Honolulu, HI",302,309,3405.0,3.0,2015-09-11,"It's been a couple years since I last dined in at Cheesecake and that was in Sherman Oaks, CA for lunch. On that particular visit, the complimentary bread and Chicken Marsala were very delicious. It was so good, it made my Instagram feed (104 weeks ago! Lol). So, I wanted to recreate the experience in Waikiki. At 6:45pm on a Wednesday, the quoted wait time was 30 mins. It was VERY CROWDED inside and out. But, there are plenty of great stores in the vicinity to check out. Or, you can stand in line at the Cheesecake/Take-Out counter to order dessert in advance! Three words: Lemoncello Creme Torte. Our pager buzzed within 30 mins, as quoted, but that was really deceiving. We still had to wait another 15 mins once we turned in our pager. There were at least 20 other customers waiting, too. For a moment we thought they forgot about us, so we inquired with one of the hostesses. She explained, once we turn in the pager, it means that our table is being prepared [not ready!]. They will call us by name when our table is ready. So, this tall, handsome young man finally calls our party of 2. He was probably the most calm, sincere, and friendly host as we walked from the front to the back of the restaurant. As we approached our table, he asked that we stand to the side to wait a few more moments as they prepare our table. Ha! I don't know if the restaurant always operates like this, but here's an idea: page/buzz customers when the table is actually ready! Our server tended to us quickly, but at times was talking way too fast I could barely comprehend what he was saying. I felt like the restaurant suckered us in falsely advertising a ""short"" wait time and now we're being rushed to order. Well, it took another 45 mins to receive our entrees - maybe that's why he was talking fast. So in the meantime, we snacked on the complimentary bread, which was not as fresh as I remember.  Chicken Marsala. The dinner serving was large enough to share between 2-3 people!! So, I ended up packing 3/4 of the plate for home. The bow tie pasta was cooked al dente (which I like). The chicken was tender. The combination of the Marsala sauce and mushrooms was divine. However, after eating a few bites, I was already full (darn you, bread!). We also had Fried Calamari. That was actually excellent. Definitely at the top of my list for best calamari in town! Highly recommend it!! If you're willing to wait, the entrees are as great as I can remember.

It might be the lighting but they always seem to overlook my bf's need for a water refill. It usually doesn't take more than 8 mins for the water refill. If it does I just give him mine.

We walked around while we waited and at 7:45ish the buzzer went off and we were seated.      After being seated we waited a while for our server to come by and when she finally did she asked if we were ready to order, we gave her our drink orders and she asked us again if we were ready.

Always a great ambiance with perfectly dim lighting and beautiful details in the restaurant, and this particular location is very well done. They even have some local flair on their menu.

333,Mandy Lee H.,"Honolulu, HI",90,76,283.0,3.0,2015-11-08,"Expect for a long wait! The wait is usually around 45 minutes for dinner whenever we visit, the wait tonight was 1 hour and 40 minutes for a booth (Saturday night). I suggest shopping around the area to pass the time; there is not a lot of seating space near the restaurant where you can wait. There are some benches along the side of the restaurant and a rock wall near the street where people often wait.  When we got to our table, they were in the middle of clearing the previous meal. We waited to the side. The hostess apologized and chatted with us so the wait wasn't as awkward... then after a bit, excused herself to help the others clear our table.  We ordered the fried macaroni and cheese, and fried calamari as our appetizers. The fried macaroni is my favorite appetizer, there are 4 deep fried macaroni and cheese balls, served with a delicious creamy marinara sauce.  The server could have been better. There was a problem where one of our entrees was taking a while to come out, but assured us that our meal was on the top of the priority list. He even offered us a soup or salad while we waited (we denied), which was nice. We ordered the chicken piccata and the bistro shrimp pasta, which were both very delicious.  At the end of our meal, we placed our parking ticket with our credit card when paying our check, and later found out that it was not validated and we had to pay the full price of parking. This was the first time we had this problem, hopefully this was a mindless mistake and it hardly happens to other people.

Got the Hawaiian pizza (was too overwhelmed with the menu so I got something familiar) and I didn't care for it. It was really floppy and soft. Not crisp like a pizza should be. I didn't really like the flavour and there was maybe ONE pineapple piece on each slice. Sometimes two if I was lucky.  The waitress knew I didn't like it and at least took it off my receipt so I appreciated that a lot.  Got a salted caramel cheesecake slice to share which was very good.  Everyone else enjoyed their meals and the portions are definitely generous.  I gave it 4 stars since I didn't wanna let my bad experience completely negatively influence my vote.

472,Nakita C.,"Honolulu, HI",626,132,182.0,5.0,2015-11-09,"This has been our family's go to and favorite restaurant for years (we think we started coming in 2004 but maybe 2005)! We used to come about once a month but now with both my brother and I being adults, it's hard to get a family dinner together. We probably come every 3 months and sometimes we're missing a person (usually me) but the missing person gets their order taken home to be enjoyed for second sessions.  We usually come around 3 to avoid waiting for a long time and we like to sit in the 80s because of the beautiful view. We usually sit at table 85.  Coming here is like lunch/dinner and lunch tomorrow! Our usual course of action is bread but we ask for no white and double brown bread, 2 orders of the tempura spicy ahi roll, and the chicken lettuce wraps. A lemon drop for my mom, a Long Island for my brother, and my dad picks something new every few visits-yesterday he got the bourbon and honey which he said was smooth and delicious!  Now let's talk about those apps-if you are a family of 4, you can not order one roll. You will fight over those pieces. It's better for everyone to just order two and let everyone get enough pieces to be happy. After you're done, the brown bread dipped into the sauce is THE BESSSSTTT! The lettuce wraps are my mom's favorite, she sometimes orders them for her entree she enjoys them that much. They come with 3 sauces that are all delicious and I like to put all 3 into my lettuce wrap.  Entrees: My dad almost always orders the jambalaya/gumbo (I've included a picture). I don't remember which title it has because my food is so delicious I don't pay super close attention but he always gets the same thing so it must be awesome.  My mom usually gets fish tacos which I always want a bite of but never do because I'm so full by the time she offers.  My brother and I switch around a lot. He usually gets steak and I used to order chicken. Our favorites are the chicken costoletta, the chicken Madeira, and the chicken Marsala. But seriously if you haven't had chicken costoletta-you should 100% order that.  I gave up being vegetarian yesterday because it was such a tease not eating chicken costoletta so I ordered the herb crusted salmon yesterday which was also delicious and served very similarly to the chicken costoletta. Our family always orders dinner sized entrees because we take home half or more and have it for second sessions around 7:30 or for lunch the next day.  Dessert: Our normal route is to order 1 for the table so we can all have a couple bites and then one each to take home.  The one for the table is usually something new or the seasonal cheesecake. My dad always orders the Godiva, my brother always orders the kahlua and I used to always order the Adams peanut butter fudge ripple but now I take after my mom and try a new one each time. I have to say it's rare we order one we don't like. They're all very good. Yesterday my mom ordered the tiramisu for her take home which is one of my favorites and I got the s'mores cheesecake which was super delish! We saved our leftovers for lunch today and busted out our cheesecakes last night and each only ate half so we're super excited to have leftovers AND half a slice of cheesecake in our lunches today.  So yes, Cheesecake Factory is a chain.

865,Mildred B.,"Waimea, HI",86,6,,5.0,2015-11-23,"This restaurant, by far is my all-time favorite!!! Every time I'm on Oahu, I make sure that I come here for lunch or dinner or even just for cheesecake!  The wait is usually about 45 minutes for a table around 5ish.  I would recommend going there for lunch or an early dinner, that way you don't have to wait so long.  Still, it is so worth the wait! The menu is not your typical menu, it is a booklet.  So many things to choose from!  I recently brought my family here for the first time.  We are a family of 6 and we do have different taste; but this menu had something for everybody!!!   Customer service is on point; these people know what they're doing!  They have perfected the balance of turning tables and catering to their customer's needs.  My cell phone was dying, and our server offered to look for an outlet where I could plug my phone.  She found one near our table where I could keep an eye on it, and in the meantime, she kept checking often because she didn't want it to go missing.  We had a late lunch there, and I guess our server was just about done for the day...she briefed the next server on us, letting her know that we were enjoying our entrees and would be ordering dessert.  She then introduced us to her and went from there.  Nice, smooth transition!  Especially for a constantly busy restaurant.  These workers really know how to keep their composure under all that pressure! I was on Oahu for radiation treatment so once I was released from the hospital, I made sure to go there and order food.  I was kept on a very strict no salt/dairy/gluten diet so I ordered the sweet potato fries and guacamole, which they could prepare for me unsalted.   The choices for cheesecake are endless; I have tried the Reese's peanut butter cup, strawberry, banana cream pie, banana split, oreo and pumpkin cheesecakes.  Every single one is amazing, but my all-time favorite would definitely be the Red Velvet Cheesecake.  It is their best seller...if you haven't tried it, please do and have one for me while you're at it!!! My last experience there, I had ordered the Red Velvet Cheesecake along with the other food mentioned above and had walked back to my hotel room which was 10 minutes away only to find that my cheesecake was forgotten.  I was a bit disappointed, but the woman who was working the cheesecake station was extremely busy and their were so many people just waiting in that area for their table, plus she had about 6 more people in her line.  I had chosen to wait outside since it was so congested in there, and I should've checked my package when I had received it.  When I had called, the young woman who answered the phone apologized profusely and forwarded me to a manager, who again, apologized profusely.  I did not want the woman who took my order to get into trouble so I explained how busy she was.  Nonetheless, I was advised to go back and pick up my cheesecake.  When I got there, they apologized again and gave me what I had initially ordered, plus an extra strawberry cheesecake!  Worth having to walk their twice!!!   Anyway, if you're ever on Oahu, please go check them out!  We had an amazing family experience and will definitely be back again and again!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=720,3.24,3.55,3.62,3.3800000000000003,3.426

Cold!   After waiting for our disappearing waitress to reappear,  she took the meal and the manager stopped by to find out who had the cold meal.   After our entire party was done eating,  my hot meal arrived.   I quickly ate the shrimp,  but had to take the pasta to go since everybody was waiting on me.   So once again,  my pasta will be cold by the time I get to eat it.   The bill arrived and my meal was not comped or discounted....

The guy controlling the front was polite and direct. When it came to our host, Paul, the atmosphere went from 100% satisfactory to sero really quick. He just grabbed the menus and started walking in a rush, and no one was behind us. There was no greeting at all! If there was it was under his breathe. I would have preferred a more welcoming introduction or ""have you guys been here before?"" Keeping that upbeat and positiveness. The one and only thing he did right was openning a seat for me. As awkward it kind of felt for him because I was a guy, he still did it and smiled the whole way through. I would not call this much of a ""nice save."" A smile only gets you so far, it is the attitude and actions that matters.  To start off, there was no proper greeting. Started off asking for drinks, but no formal greeting. She asked if we wanted bread, i dont know if you were suppose to make that a question. It just sounded weird when she ASKED us. As we observed, there was a lot of inconsistency. She greeted the guest next to us properly, ""I'll be your server for today."" We were working literally eating bread, and some guy with long, dreadlike hair asked if he can take it away. That was done very poorly. And we actually wanted more after. One great thing about the service today, a lot of teamwork. Towards the end though, instead of asking if we wanted dessert, she asked if we wanted dessert to-go. Is that the Cheesecake factory way? Overall, we experienced that it seemed like because we were young, our server paid little to no attention to us. But, from noticing the guests next to us, she seemed like an alright server. Aside from the end, both us and the other guest was waiting for like 15mins on our check and there were a few servers who just passed to set tables. They obviously saw that we were done and said nothing. We felt kind of discriminated possibly because the thoughts of us having a lack of knowledge on serving. I enjoyed observing because this was a perfect example of ""Poor service"". Wheres the smiles? Where is the welcoming, Aloha-spirit?  The only reason they deserve one star and because I can't do 0 is their timing on food. Food was amazing, as always! Nicely done with portion sizes and presentation.

Hubs and I decided to go eat something yummy, and wound up here. Our wait time for lunch at 1pm on a Saturday was less than 5 minutes. They sat us in the front room, which looks out into the alley facing Nalu storage (surf board racks) and open seating on the lanai. Not bad, but definitely not meant to be a romantic seating space as it is 4 2-tops along a bench. Good thing we weren't there to be romantic! It was entertaining to watch the waitstaff dodge a particular bird who thought he owned the joint. He swooped in a couple of times, and then strutted up and down the aisle until he was shooed completely out the front.  Hubs had the fish and chips lunch and I went with the Cuban and a salad. The wait time for food was a little sluggish, but at least they were on point with my Big Island Ice Tea. We had some calamari, which had the perfect crunch to ring ratio, and that yummy garlic dip--we had to ask for more of that. Waited awhile for the bread which was supposed to be coming straight out of the oven, but it might've had a short delay because it wasn't piping hot, but it was warm. The fish and chips were crunchy and some sort of cod. My Cuban was HUGE! I could only eat half of it. And it was on-point. The yummy pickles added that special crunch.  Our waitress offered the cheesecake dessert specials, but there was no way we were going to finish any more food, so we ordered dessert to go; salted caramel for him, and white chocolate macadamia nut for me.

We figure it's going to be crazy busy (yes it was) so we walk it down to kill time.  My two boys starving waiting to scarf down some steak. We get there after a 15 minute walk and make our way inside through the craziness outside and the line trying to get in.  We ask one of the hostesses where we needed to go for take out orders and she points us to a long line by the cheesecakes.  After about a 10 minute wait, the customer behind us asks another employee if we were in the correct place for take out orders because everyone else seemed to be ordering cheesecakes.  The employee tells us we are in the cheesecake line and need to go to another register! Upset and starving at this point, we excuse our way through another mess of people to the register and the cashier is busy looking busy.  (Who knows what the heck she was doing.  She didn't acknowledge me yet.)  So I tell her I'm picking up a take-out order.  After a few more seconds she asks for my name.  I give her my name and she can't find anything.  I give her my wife's name, nothing.  She asks what I ordered.  So I tell her and she picks up some receipts and starts punching stuff in.  Then she asks me again what I ordered.  Nothing.  She tells me hold on and walks to the back.  Tack on 5 more minutes.  She comes back and tells me she is waiting for someone in the office to transfer orders to her, but said she saw food that looks like my order in the back.  She asks me again for my name and disappears to the back again.  5 more minutes, my son is complaining because he is starving, and a gentleman standing next to me tells me he's been waiting there for an hour already.  I'm surrounded by people who don't look too happy.  The cashier finally returns, this time with back up.  The guy who came with her tells me ""apparently"" SOMEONE lost my order and they would have to place my order and I would have to ""wait a bit."" So I tell him that the cashier said she saw an order that looked like mine in the back but they would have to start all over again and I would have to wait even longer than I and my starving family already had AFTER calling ahead to avoid waiting!  He said yes.  I shook my head and told him Happy New Year and walked away as he shrugged his shoulders.

Dined in a few minutes after they opened, which is probably the best time considering that after maybe 10-20 minutes, the place got packed! It took awhile for my bf & I to decide what to eat because it was hard to pick from the many different choices on their menu. But while we needed more time, our waiter offered us some bread & butter. We finally made our orders, I got the combo of the Steak Diane with Shrimp Scampi with mashed potatoes, my bf got the hamburger steak dinner portion & we also ordered the deep fried mac & cheese & fried calamari. Once our food came in soon after, we realized we got too much food. The portions here are huuuuuge! The fried calamari was yummy, which came with 2 sauces a garlic mayo & a marinara sauce. The fried Mac & cheese was very cheesy. My combo plate was so full of flavor but the hamburger steak wasn't anything special though. We didn't end up finishing our plates so we got take out for our left overs.  Besides the many entree choices, there are also many cheesecake choices! For dessert we ordered the white chocolate caramel macadamia cheesecake & an original cheesecake with fresh strawberries. I didn't like the white chocolate caramel macadamia, I love sweets but this was just too sweet for me. So the original with strawberries was the best one.

The bartender was super busy but made it a point to let us know that she saw us and to let her know when she was ready. When we were ready we ordered our first round of drinks, and she gave us some time to look over the menu. The menu is HUGE, so many options, but a little overwhelming. But it's great when you don't know what you want, because there is a little of everything.  We finally decided on two burgers. Real original, I know. The guy next to us got his food before us, and he ordered a while after us. The bartender noticed as well and immediately got someone's attention and asked them to check on our food.  A few minutes went by with nothing, so she called for a manager. A manager was over by our side promptly,  apologizing for the food taking longer than expected. He told us that when we finished our burgers that desert was on them and even if we were full to order it to go.  While we waited for our burgers, another patron was talking to the bartender as if he knew her and his laugh was contagious. He seemed funny and someone full of spunk and stories. So we decided to send him over a shot. He was awesome and came to thank us. :) Our burgers came!!! Yeah! The food itself was good. Nothing over the top, cooked to the temp that we ordered!!  The burgers were huge, I couldn't finish mine. (which is rare) we were soooooo full!!! So, we ordered the red velvet cheesecake to go. (it was amazing)  The manager came back over to apologize again for the slow service (it ended up being a mix up in the kitchen) and said because we only got one desert that he took off the shot that we ordered. It was so nice, over the top and not expected. Thank you!!  Also, another thank you to the waiter that was so nice, polite and had such good positive vibes. He wasn't our waiter, but he was walking by and my bf was curious to what drinks he was carrying and he took the time to stop tell us what drinks they were, what was in them, and he even suggested his favorite. It was just really nice because he took the time to stop and talk to us, he wasn't annoyed or taken back.  The bartender's name was Erica, the waiter was Joe, and I apologize I forget the managers name, but I want to say it was Bryan.

I've been going here since I was in high school, so that would mean over a course of 10 years. And, no matter what I ordered, food is always so delicious. Out of the many dishes I've tried, there are a number of them that I don't mind reordering again and again. These dishes include the portobello mushroom burger, pasta da vinci, sweet corn tamale cakes, bang-bang chicken and shrimp, and fried calamari. The tartar sauce and marinara sauce that comes with the fried calamari are by far my favorite compared to other restaurants.  For majority of my visits, we received pretty good service.

403,Kristine C.,"Honolulu, HI",899,443,8388.0,4.0,2016-02-04,"Not a day goes by that I don't see an overflowing amount of people waiting to get a seat at Hawai's only Cheesecake factory on the island. Call me lucky but, of all the times I've dined in, I've not had to wait for more than 20 minutes. Upon leaving your lovely name on the list with the hostess, you're given your nifty restaurant pager. Cheesecake factory sits on the right side of Kalakaua's busy street (next to Forever 21) on the first floor. You can't miss it.  Wooden furnishings and marble tiles give the vicinity a nice elegant touch with very light metalwork elements. On the right side of the entrance, people form a separate line for takeout and making ordering easy for slices of their famous cheesecakes. That is if you only want to want a pleasuring dessert on the go. The line goes fairly quick.  With an already large restaurant, Cheesecake Factory seems to have a fast turnaround with seating.  An inviting part of the restaurant is the bar with large screens for the sports fanatics. Seats line the bar as well as high top chairs as an option for dining in a more laid back scale. Their clean restrooms are readily available on the right if you break the seal too soon (if you know what I mean). Seats are available in family style and large parties. I very much enjoy their outdoor seating option as it gets freezing cold inside the restaurant. It's also very dim and not enough light on the inside. Why not dine outside and appreciate the alfresco with the fresh smell of the pacific ocean. My dining companion and I wanted to dine outdoors and we were seated after 10 minutes.  A server had stated she will be with us shortly. At this time we still have not received our waters or even any service for that matter. The restaurant wasn't at all busy yet. We were very forgiving and gave her another 5 minutes or so. After she returned repeatedly serving the table behind us it was already 15-20 minutes later. I upsettingly flagged the server on the opposite side asking for waters and for service. He immediately discovered my unruly tone and called for a manager. Slade (the general manager) approached us and immediately apologized for the lack of service and checked on us from time to time. Bobby (our new server) had apologized and served us wonderfully during the duration of our entire dining experience.   After enjoying their nicely toasted white and wheat bread with butter, I enjoyed their Garlic Noodles. This is a nice spaghetti dish with fresh asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, nice whole oven roasted cherry tomatoes with parmesan in a garlic sauce. This is beautifully served with a nice big part of the chicken (can be ordered with shrimp or chicken). I enjoyed this dish with all the vegetables and the chicken as my protein. The chicken is delightfully juicy and not greasy and the little part of the skin was crunchy after the first slice into the meat.   Overall, I very much enjoyed my recent experience here with a slight bump on the side. Their customer service is great with them recognizing the flaw right away. I've also enjoyed many of their cheesecakes in the past. With my cheesecake cravings, this is definitely my go to place. It's that simple.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=240,3.64,3.56,3.58,3.472,3.5920000000000005
304,Monica F.,"Toronto, Canada",34,149,810.0,5.0,2016-02-05,"There's a reason why this place is so popular... Cheesecake Factory is the bomb! I wish we had them in Canada. We were here 4 times during our 10 day trip in Honolulu. And came by once just for cheesecake, lol.  Their menu is so huge, it takes a while to decide what you're going to get. Would be a great place for picky eaters since they're bound to find something here they'd enjoy. And the prices are very fair, considering the area.  I had the Cajun chicken ""littles"" twice, they were that good. I think they put quotations beside the word ""little"" on the menu because it's anything but. You get like, 10 pieces of chicken, it's ridiculous. They are basically chicken fingers served with mashed potatoes and corn succotash. I appreciate how they serve the chicken with vegetables as opposed to French fries cause the chicken is already fried (although I'm sure I could have substituted for fries if I wanted to).  I also had the best burger I've ever had in my LIFE here for our last meal in Honolulu-- the Americana Burger. I think it's their version of a Big Mac cause it's got that thousand islands ""secret sauce"" on it. I don't know if I'll ever be able to have a McDonald's Big Mac again.... Holy cow.    I also got the chicken parm sandwich, which was good, but the least favourite thing I ordered there. I didn't like the roasted peppers that came with it.  My dad got the Cuban sandwich, which was the least favourite thing he ordered (maybe sandwiches aren't their strongest suit?), the steak Diane, chicken Madeina, and the chicken parm with pasta. His favourite was the chicken Madeina. I had a taste of it and it was really good. They sure don't skimp on the cheese!  I tried the Oreo and turtles cheesecake too, and Oreo is definitely the way to go. It's one of the most popular cheesecakes. It was funny cause I was all like ""what a chincy size slice for $9"" but I couldn't even finish it. Soooo good.  Apparently this is the highest grossing Cheesecake Factory in the world.

We followed the meal with a Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake and the Banana Cream Cheesecake. Wow! We were blown away with both cheesecakes!

The pasta was perfectly prepared (the chicken was a little grisly, but that was the only downside); noodles and vegetables to perfection, chicken seasoned and tenderly cooked. Amazing. My husband was shocked at the size of his sandwich. Portions are definitely large enough to share. Service was a little slow, but she was very friendly and checked on us frequently. My biggest beef, aside from the wait, is how LOUD it is in the restaurant.  The room can literally be half empty and the sound just magnifies and bounces off the walls.

My boyfriend had ordered a filet mignon and we was wondering how come his food didnt come yet because all of ours did and they told him that they gave his food away  even more so i was like wth. But it was nice of them to offere him a soup or salad to wait cause they had to remake his food so even more long he had to wait to eat.

So glad Judy recruited Frankie to get there early to put in our reservation.  So, the plan was the table would be ready to receive us by 7:00pm.  We arrive then, sit, order and enjoy.  You know how the best laid plans are easily laid to waste?  Guilty as charged.  I was the last to arrive close to 8pm.  Embarassing yes?  I needed a drink. Lemon Drop Martini $12.25 This was sweeter than normal, I think.  How'd they do that?  Well, it was good for me.  Pricey though. Everyone ordered immediately but I wasn't hungry.  I was trying to get something light besides salad but couldn't find anything.  Not even in the appetizer section either.

I'm usually not a big fan of filling up on carbs but there was a good variety to choose from here. Each ready-to-split piece was quite chewy and moist. Easy on the butter if you can help it though since generally there is a lot to come. The French Country Salad came with mixed greens, grilled asparagus, beets, goat cheese, candied pecans, and vinaigrette. The acidity from the vinaigrette is what made all the other ingredients stand out. Each bite was quite tasty but I wish there were a few more beets to be found since they were claimed to be so fresh. The Parmesan-Herb Crusted Chicken was a plate of sautéed chicken breasts coated with parmesan-garlic. On the outside these looked like cute hamburger patties but they were actually made of kitchen. The sauce had unfortunately sploshed around on my plate by the time it arrived which soiled the presentation a bit. Taste-wise, the bread crumbs added a nice texture but the chicken was a bit dry in some places. There was enough sauce to compensate, but I don't think this sauce compensation should be a long-term solution. My favourite plate of the evening was the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo. This was a mixed plate of shrimp, chicken, andouille sausage, tomatoes, peppers, onions, and garlic simmered in a spicy cajun style broth with cream and topped with steamed white rice. This was a very exciting dish as it came, though I feel the herb bits scattered around the white rim of the plate should have been kept to the middle ring. This tasted great though! The meats were all cooked very well and while the other two dishes were a bit of a miss for me, this gumbo was good enough to salvage any meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=420,3.72,3.56,3.624,3.1480000000000006,3.6240000000000006

276,Jay T.,"Austin, TX",181,260,2057.0,4.0,2016-03-15,"I love the Cheesecake Factory because of their food; especially different cheesecake flavors!  The restaurant is located in the heart of Waikiki. Park at the Royal Hawaiian where the first hr is free w/ validation while the rest is $2/hr!   Cheesecake Factory is pretty spacious and can hold a lot of guests, although, not big enough for the non-stop traffic (both tourists and locals) in Waikiki. This is right next to forever 21 and across from Macy's, therefore, shopping while waiting is an option.  They do not take reservations and the lines are always long! But for someone surrounded by Asian and local restaurants and loves (everything else but that) American food, the wait is bearable for me. I've been to this restaurant a handful of times and never failed to receive good service. Ambiance is up to par and can be intimate in the evenings while food on the other hand is always good. They have great food varieties, although, my favorite appetizer personally is the avocado roll while salted caramel for the cheesecake, but of course those are both personal preference since everything, I think, is good. Lastly, you will also get your money's worth out of their alcohol beverages because it's strong! You can really taste the alcohol in it specifically in the margaritas. All in all, I recommend Cheesecake Factory with or without long wait times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=120,3.68,3.55,3.64,3.3440000000000003,3.6020000000000003

My waiter was Mark from the Big Island and he was upbeat and courteous with all his interactions.  I was having issues with my voice and he didn't hesitate to lean in to hear what I was trying to say.  My interaction with him was probably the best part of my experience at The Cheesecake Factory. I ordered the spinach artichoke dip and it was okay.  Some of the artichoke hearts completely missed the blade in the blender.  It didn't have much flavor, but the salty tortilla chips helped it out.  My favorite dish here is Chicken Madiera so it is my ""go to meal.""  Last week the chicken breasts were smaller and the sauce was salty, but the potatoes helped absorb that and the meal balanced out.  Today though there was barely any wine sauce and I think I had at least half a pound of mushrooms on top of my chicken breasts.  The chicken breast was tender as usual and the asparagus was its usual as well.  I only had three bites and debated on whether to get something else, but didn't. Tonight the meal fell flat so I decided to just go for dessert and take the meal home. My excitement quickly subsided as I looked over the menu.  I was even more disappointed in the cheesecake selection.  They seem to have removed a large selection and the ones available were not up to my standards.  There was only one cheesecake with coconut and it had more chocolate than coconut.  I looked tirelessly for the pineapple upside down cheesecake and lo and behold it is gone too.   Overall if it was not for the service Mark gave me, I'd be giving them one star.  This is not the quality of what I am used to from The Cheesecake Factory and I doubt I will be coming back here any time soon .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=140,3.4,3.59,3.644,2.9520000000000004,3.5140000000000002

The restaurant is known to get extremely busy between 5:30 and 6:00 pm. The wait can be excruciating, especially on an empty stomach.   We parked in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center garage, which, connects to the Sheraton's parking garage via stairs. (The validations are different for each lot, so mind the signs.) All parking fees in the RHSC garage must be pre-paid at the kisosk near the elevators in the garage. There is no parking attendant on duty down the ramp that you can pay, if you forget. Be prepared to walk a bit to the restaurant as the garage is at the other end of the shopping center. Upon our arrival to the restaurant at 4:45 pm, we were quickly seated. If you have a seating preference, state it to the hostess right away. The restrooms are located down a corridor before the kitchen.  The noise level is pretty loud. The menu. Extensive to say the least. Eggs and omelettes are served all day. There is a Sunday Brunch menu within the main menu, and also a lunch menu.  We began with house bread (sourdough and a dark oat bread) and butter, and an order of fried calamari. A bit on the salty side, but worked well with the garlic aioli and cocktail sauce. The morsels were lightly breaded and fried. Not at all chewy and tough. Very soft and pleasant to the palate. A+ Do not take the lunch menu lightly by expecting a tiny portion. You will be more wrong!  I chose the Chicken Piccata, lunch portion, because I wanted dessert, of course!  Three nice size pieces of the most flavorful, tender & juicy chicken in a lemon butter and caper sauce and a very generous portion of angel hair pasta.  A+ Limoncello Cream Torte traveled very nicely home. The whipped cream held up quite well and was very creamy. The cake was dense and sweet and the cream between the layers was tart. The frosting on the outside of the torte had some crunchies in it, which gave it a nice contrasting texture. A+ Just over an hour and we were out the door.

She would never make it in A mainland Cheesecake Factory, she can get away with it due to the high tourism traffic. The worst experience I ever  had at  any of the chains!

I ordered the combo Steak Diane and Chicken Medeira it was burnt to a crisp like leathered beef jerky my husband ordered Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi and he got Salmon and shrimp instead that was at 9 pm we sat at 830 pm they redid both orders then my husbands steak and shrimp comes at 930 pm and my steak and chicken comes out 20 minutes later at 950 pm. We kept asking for water refills and only at 955 pm did we get it. We ordered to appetizers the guacamole that we said spicy which had zero spice or flavor we had to add salt the chips were cold and oily. The tomato mozzarella toast was ok but super sweet like they added sugar to it which was strange. I also ordered a mixed drink that tasted like diabetes in a glass. I took one sip and told the waitress to take it away. Again asked for more water which of course never came. The second time around that the food came out my steak Diane was so blue it had a pulse and was cold and my husbands was cold also. Strange yet bad experience. The waitstaff kept banging our booth and I was so upset that I just had to leave so at 958 asked for check. They comped the drink and a free slice of cheesecake.

When you come during those peak hours, you wait longer than expected. My friend came around 6:30PM on a Saturday night and put down her name for a table of 10. It was a hella long 3 hours wait. It's insane. Was it worth it? To me, not really. The hostess said 2 and a half hours and it ended up to 3 hours. So we basically ate dinner at 9:15 PM. We were all starving like cows!  We were all excited after the beeper vibrated. We walked inside and was seated all the way in the back of the restaurant. As soon as we sat down we already know what we wanted to order. When we saw the waitress, my friend instantly requested for water and tons of bread for all of us...literally. 10 minutes later our bread came and there was only one basket of it. That's it?! The kitchen was backed up so it was slow. We asked for more bread (white and brown). It came with butter. I loved the brown bread. It was soft and yummy. 10 minutes later our appetizer came. We shared a avocado spring roll. It came with about 6 rolls with sweet and sour dipping sauce. It tasted pretty good. Spring rolls stuffed with avocado. Need the sauce with it or it'll be bland and dry. 15-20 minutes later our main entree came. I ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta (rigatoni, with veggies). So, I shall complain now. The rigatoni was not even fully cooked. It wasn't soft. The pasta tasted like oil and seasoning mixed together. It wasn't even special. I'm so disappointed. I wasn't able to finish it so I took it home. It's true, maybe they are known for the cheesecake and not the food. I was full from bread so I wasn't able to order the cheesecake.  Next time if I come to cheesecake factory, I'm doing take out. Cheesecake take out is available too on the side. It's much more faster! I'm done with the experience. Service was slow, but I understand it's busy. Maybe they should hire more servers?

So, we saw an opening in the bar area & took that risk! for those of you who are frequent ""dining outers,"" you all know that service in the bar area is hit or miss. In this case, the service was spot on! We have only have one person to thank for that and it was Blaine! Although the bar area was packed, Blaine was very considerate and attentive, not only to our table, but to all of his tables. He was super kind and friendly as well! Just his service alone made our experience a positive one.  But of course, I need to review the food. Let's just say it's Cheesecake Factory! I mean everything is good here! I ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps (Create your own Thai lettuce rolls! Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Coconut Curry Noodles & Lettuce Leaves with three delicious Spicy Thai Sauces - Peanut, Sweet Red Chili & Tamarind-Cashew). How does that sound?! Exactly!!! This appetizer is really big enough to serve 2 people, but I was pretty hungry. All the flavors blended so well together and each of the sauces gave each roll a unique taste profile! They were not spicy at all. Even better, there was the perfect amount of chicken for each piece of lettuce! Where does that ever happen? It happens at Cheesecake Factory! My wife ordered the Kale & Quinoa Salad (lots of tender kale, quinoa, grapes, sweet red pepper, sunflower seeds & parmesan cheese. Tossed with our Lemon Vinaigrette). Umm...just order it if you are looking at a ""healthy"" salad. This salad has so much flavor that you will not be able to put down your fork! The bitterness of the kale is balanced out with the sweetness of the grapes and the tanginess of the vinaigrette! And, its super healthy! There is a generous portion on this order, so you could definitely share, or save some for later! Bottom line: if you can stand the wait, come here to eat! Just like other Cheesecake Factory locations, the food will not disappoint! And, it is located on the main strip (Kalakaua Ave) in Waikiki with a nice sized lanai to eat on!

The next time we saw her, we asked for boxes, some cheesecake to go, and the check.

My wife and I always go to restaurants starving and yes, eat as much as we can before we waddle out.

Though I wish it was a somewhat bigger portion, ate the red cabbage it was served with - had a nice crunch and the sesame flavored sauce was refreshing.  I myself had the falafel salad. Overly dressed, so I recommend to order the dressing on the side! I am a believer of not returning food unless it was not specific to my personal order so that was my mistake. The falafel was good! Not too oily and had good flavor for sure. My date had the fish encrusted with macadamia nut or whatever. Being a market priced item, I was disappointed, very small portion and overcooked. The rice and veggies it came with was good though! Cheesecake rules thus any flavor is delicious, salted caramel was on point, wish that was the only thing I ordered.  SERVICE - makes or breaks you as a restaurant but I guess not in this case, it absolutely was not up to par. Was seated but didn't receive water or introduction for 11 minutes. I understand it was busy but an acknowledgement would've been appreciated. Waitress looked exhausted, didn't seem very friendly - more robotic and monotone, turned me off didn't really want to ask questions or for recommendations (that's why I ended up with a salad ha). But the turn around for time for food made up for lack of customer service there.  They are busy, I completely understand that part but acknowledgement would've made the experience better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=360,3.32,3.52,3.54,3.2120000000000006,3.4400000000000004

There certainly is something for everyone on the menu. We have been twice in the week we were in Waikiki. The first time we had grilled fish tacos and Evelyn's Favourite Rigatoni pasta & a slice of the fresh strawberry cheesecake. Both mains were great & the cheesecake was nice - though I'm not much of a cheesecake person but I had to try it while I was there. After seeing the next table order burgers we were excited to come back and try the burgers for ourselves. The second time we had the Americana burger with sweet potato fries and the Traditional burger with fries. Wow! The burgers there are fantastic! The meat patty is thick and juicy and cooked to your own liking. The sweet potato fries were the best I've ever had. All meals were fresh and the service is quick.

232,Dani S.,"Honolulu, HI",27,125,318.0,4.0,2016-06-20,"""Let them eat cheesecake! "" That's what Marie Antoinette would have said if she ate here.  This place serves much more than cheesecake. They serve burgers, pastas, salads, brunch items, girth expanding desserts and more.  The menu is huge.  Even the pickiest or healthiest eater can find something to eat.  I love the crab hash.  The kids brunch with French toast, bacon and fresh fruit is another good choice.  I always have my doubts about whether Mainland chain restaurants make their dishes to order, but the food here certainly tastes fresh and delicious.  The portions are generous.  I'm mostly a low carb eater, but I throw that out the window because this place is carb heaven. Before I forget I want to commend the excellent server we had today.  Blaine K. not only provided prompt service, but he even laughed sincerely at my husband's jokes which is much appreciated since today is Fathers Day and we wanted him to feel special.  The decor reminds me of some rustic Italian villa.  The lighting is good for those of us of a certain age who want flattering lighting, but it might be too dim for some. The only criticism I have of this particular Cheesecake Factory is the traffic flow.  It's very crowded and hectic. You get a pager until you're called which can range from 5 minutes to 1 hour.  You need to avoid peak hours or you'll have a long wait.  We only waited 10 minutes today, so it wasn't bad.  When the pager goes off, you get asked to stand near the hostess counter which is also near the stroller parking area while they find a server to seat you.  It's a narrow area not meant for a lot of people to be standing around. Meanwhile, there are many people entering and leaving the restaurant. Parking can be done at the Royal Hawaiian and the Cheesecake Factory validates the parking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=100,3.32,3.59,3.532,3.056,3.482

Okay so I have been to this Cheesecake Factory a few times before and we had excellent service and everything I tried before was very good but this last time we went we had HORRIBLE customer service. Our waitress we had didn't seem in the best mood and wasn't the friendliest(which of course I understand we all have our bad days and that place gets crazy busy). Anyways we ordered our food and I order a pasta dish I've never tried before it was the Four Cheese Pasta(it normally comes with marinara but I asked for Alfredo sauce instead and it didn't seem to be a problem). I got my order and just decided I really did not like it so I asked our waitress if I would be able to switch it out for something different that I've had before and I knew I for sure liked(and no I don't normally do this at restaurants) and she said yeah sure no problem. Well then about 5 minutes later I see this guy(pretty sure he was a manager, I'm not sure though) come out with my same pasta dish that I asked if I could switch out and he says ""so you made us do a special order for you, this item on our menu is a special request item(which I didn't know I guess I didn't read the fine print closely enough), and now you don't want?"" I said well I don't really like it to much I'm sorry I can just keep it, it's fine. He said ""alright I'll just box it up for you then"". He left the table and our waitress comes by a couple seconds later and I asked for her to just cancel my other order then because I don't really want to pay for two dishes and she said alrighty no problem. Then about 10 minutes later the guy walks up to our table with our bill, my to go box, and the other dish in a box that I asked her to please cancel it and he said ""well here's your quesadilla, do you still want it or do you just want me to throw it away?"" And I told him that I told our waitress to cancel it and he said ""well we made it so what do you want me to do with it?"" I said well I don't want to pay for two dishes sir I'm sorry I don't know what else to tell you. He said ""alright I'll just got throw it away"" and then gave us our bill and left the table. I was so angry with the tone he was using with us, the way he handle the whole situation...I was just shaking so bad because I did not know what to say to him or how to even handle the whole situation. Any other restaurants I've ever been to and end up not liking a dish they either offer to switch it out or take the dish off the bill entirely and are very nice and respectful about it.

My last and only memory of this place was that the food was good, not great, and everything else was mediocre.  I was in Waikiki for 4th of July weekend and understandably it was more crowded than normal - 2 hour wait at 9pm at night. No thanks. But I came back the next morning and around 945am it wasn't crowded we got seated quickly.  The hostesses (male and female) left a lot to be desired. Not real friendly or engaging - the bare minimum. The guy leading us to our table just confirmed our name then started walking, no welcome or anything. Luckily we had an awesome server. She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and she had a great happy vibe. She made us all feel comfortable. Timely visits to check on us and very accommodating.  The food was excellent as well. Of course everything in Waiks is overpriced but here they give you so much food it's like two meals. The food tasted fresh and was very flavorful - good salads and soup, pizzas, and my steak tacos.  My party all got their food before me and mine took a long time. The manager came out (without prompting) and said the cook overdid my steak and would cook a new dish. She politely asked if I minded waiting, apologized, and offered me a choice of a free side menu item or cheesecake. How awesome is that?!

OK, there was another wait of 20 mins in order to sit together. We finally got our table at almost 10:30pm.  There were two tiny tables and could barely fit 9 chairs.  At least we could all sit together.  However, the service was not very good.  Less than one hour after we got our food.  Several of our plates were taken away by the waitress without asking us if we FINISH OR NOT.  Also, we ask for breads couple times without success because the answer was ""the kitchen is so busy and I already do my best to give you the bread"".   We finished our ""DINNER"" almost 12am.  The experience before was good.  I guess they were too busy on Saturday night so couldn't keep up the service and quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=880,3.2,3.37,3.508,2.9480000000000004,3.302
307,Ash C.,"Honolulu, HI",379,262,3613.0,3.0,2016-07-27,"Everyone and their mama knows about Cheesecake Factory. It's probably one of the biggest food chains across the country. That's probably one of the main reasons why it's always so busy. If you come here for lunch, wait times are actually good. Usually if you get there before noon, you can get sat right away. But if you come here for dinner, you better eat like a side meal or bring a snack because wait times can go up to almost 2 hours! And sometimes they even run out of pagers, so they just give you a piece of paper and ask you to come back later for a pager. Cheesecake Factory has a very large and expansive menu, over 250 dishes! They have everything: lunch specials (served until 5pm), breakfast all day, burgers, regular entrees, alcohol and CHEESECAKE for dessert. I normally come here for lunch with my coworkers and we usually take advantage of their lunch specials. They have couple options on their menu that comes in lunch-size portions: salad, soup and salad, salad and pizza, pasta, chicken, salmon and other specialties for reasonable pricing. I normally get the salad and pizza (BBQ Chicken Pizza is my favorite) as I always end up taking home leftovers because the portions are large for me. My boyfriend usually appreciates when I have leftover pizza for him to eat lol. And of course you can't forget about their famous cheesecakes. I normally don't make it to dessert, but they have over 30 different flavors. And depending on the season, they may have special flavors to try.   On my most recent visit, we came here for dinner around 6pm for a party of 8. The wait was 1 hour and 45 minutes. OMG. But since this is where the birthday girl wanted to go, we decided to walk around Waikiki and just wait. We luckily got buzzed 15 minutes earlier, but because our big group split up during the wait, only 3 of us were able to make it back to the restaurant first. They wouldn't sit us until half our party was there. A bit ridiculous if you ask me as we were already waiting for so long. We told them they were in the area and on their way, but they still wouldn't sit us. So as we waited for the rest of our party to show up, we prayed they didn't give our table away.  After we finally got sat, the first thing everyone asked was ""are the lights on?"" It was so dark, we had to use the flashlight off our phones to see the menu better. On top of that, our waiter, Brian I think was his name, was the real MVP (sarcasm). When he finally took our orders, he would take down 2 orders, then disappear, and then show up again, and then disappear again. It was quite annoying as he did that with our water refills too. And when we asked if it was possible to split the check, he tried to make us feel bad by saying it'll take longer to split. And before he left to place our orders, he made another comment that he thought was funny by saying ""I had to stop my temptations to tell you I can't split the check."" I know I probably gave him the death stare after he said that because that was just rude! After we got our food, he was non-existent until we got our bill. The only highlight of that night was there was live entertainment that played oldies but goodies songs.  Other than that rude waiter, the food here is actually not too bad. I did like the Chicken Madeira. The chicken was tender, had lots of mushrooms and asparagus and the sauce was delicious. I liked the cheese, but it may have been too much cheese on the chicken. Their Miso Salmon is another favorite of mines. As for their cheesecakes, my favorite is probably their Pineapple Upside Down cheesecake. And I recently tried their Oreo Dream Extreme cheesecake. It looks really rich, but it was actually light and fluffy. And it came with a huge oreo cookie on top! Customer service isn't the greatest here as on other occasions, service is usually slow, even during lunch time when it's not too busy. But I usually come back here because of the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=140,3.28,3.37,3.5,3.2120000000000006,3.334

They were having a promotion for 2 days July 29 and July 30 for 50% off slices of any slice of cheesecake DINE IN ONLY.. I love New York cheesecake, the creamy rich texture, so delicious! Calories that are so worth it all. I've had the authentic rich NY cheesecake while I was on a trip in New York and man I want those...  This is the only location on island and being that it is in Waikiki, the line is usually very long! Crowded, sometimes long wait. I was lucky because Lyla and Ed arrived when they opened, got a table. I truly appreciated them for waiting for me... while I took a good 30mins to get there. I got lost, missed the turn to the parking structure at Royal Hawaiian. Then made a wrong turn into a one way street YIKES! Being a local, Waikiki isn't just confusing for tourist hahah. But with all these one way streets, it makes you mad... you gotta start all over if you miss that one turn..  Finally, I made it. Cheesecake was on my mind for days!!! Since it was lunch time I got the Louisana Chicken which was $4 cheaper than the regular dinner price. the Louisiana chicken comes with bow tie pasta and chicken Parmesan. The sauce has a creamy spicy taste with some vegetables like onion and tomato. The chicken was juicy. Not overly cooked. Lyla got her usual.. Evelyn's Favorite. The pasta was light but good. I could see why she always order that.  Ed got the lunch special, Rene special (sandwich that comes with salad and a potato soup) wow what a deal. Portion was generous! The soup was yummy!  THE BEST PART: THE CHEESECAKE!!! Lyla ordered the lemon meringue cheesecake. I got the Mango keylime cheesecake. Now now we both wanted the sweet and sour yet savory of the cheesecake. I liked mine, although they should have asked if I wanted whip cream... I personally don't like whip cream in mostly anything. It's unwanted calories I could use towards other things. Let me tell you, first time trying this slice, my mango keylime cheesecake was mango-y with a kick of lime and that coconut macaroon crust went well together! It had lots of shredded coconut in every bite.  The lemon meringue was bold! I like that too!

251,Lyla D.,"Honolulu, HI",541,1010,13815.0,4.0,2016-07-31,"This year, National Cheesecake Day was celebrated on July 30, 2016.  We heard about The Cheesecake Factory's special as they generously offered 50% discount off any of their cheesecakes for both Friday, July 29 and Saturday, July 30.  The special was limited to DINE-IN, ONLY. We always see lines and crowds waiting to get into The Cheesecake Factory in Waikīkī.  This location must truly be their flagship restaurant for its immense seating capacity and customer turnover.  Fortunately, this restaurant is located in the Royal Hawaiian Center where they offer free 2 hour parking validation. After we attending to some errands on Saturday morning, we drove into Waikīkī and arrived just before The Cheesecake Factory's 11:00AM opening.  There was a line of about 10 people that had formed in front of the restaurant. But, as soon as the doors opened, the friendly and cheerful hostesses quickly escorted the people to their seats, including us.   TCF's menu is filled with so many menu items that it is like reading a book and we took our time to ""study"" the menu.   Our server was so patient, cheerful and attentive. He checked with us often to refill our beverages and even tempted us by passing by with other customers' orders while we waited for our lunch buddy.  By the time Lora C arrived, we had made our menu decisions.  She quickly perused the menu as we steered her to consider the lunch specials because we kept in mind our plans to order cheesecake for dessert. THE FOOD: -Louisiana Chicken Pasta:   Parmesan crusted chicken served over bow-tie pasta with mushrooms, peppers, onions in a spicy New Orleans sauce. The Parmesan crusted chicken, according to Lora, was chicken breast meat that was crisp on the outside and juicy, tender inside.  The bow tie pasta was cooked al dente and the creamy ""spicy"" New Orleans sauce provided a nice complement to the crispy-crusted chicken.  As for spiciness, it wasn't spicy at all and barely had a chile kick but, the flavor was good.  The lunch special was priced at $14.95 whereas the dinner portion usually runs as $18.95. -Evelyn's Favorite Pasta:  Rigatoni topped with broccoli, oven-dried tomatoes, roasted eggplant, mushrooms, onions, artichokes, Kalamata olives, garlic and pine nuts.  I always seem to order this pasta because of its flavorful Mediterranean flavors.  But, I really wish they hadn't removed their Indian Fry-Bread sandwich. I ordered the dinner portion as it was priced at $15.95, just a dollar more than the lunch special and got a larger portion that I could doggie bag for later snacking. -Renee's Special:  Half of a turkey sandwich came with today's special soup (Stuffed Baked Potato) and tossed green salad for only $12.95.  My husband enjoyed his turkey sandwich which was stuffed with fresh lettuce, tomatoes and lots of fresh baked turkey.  The stuffed baked potato soup was thick and tasted like a fully-loaded potato yet in a soup form. He must've enjoyed it as he cleaned his plate.   DESSERT:   -Mango Key Lime Cheesecake: this fluffy key-lime flavored cheesecake was topped with mango mousse and its crust was made from vanilla coconut macaroons.   We liked the mango flavor and subtle lime flavor.  The coconut macaroon crust was good but we felt it should have been more chewy rather than crisp but, to each his own.... -Lemon Meringue Cheesecake:  I am smitten by lemon and meringue desserts as its bright lemony flavor brings out Summer so this was my choice.  The lemon curd that was swirled into the fluffy, yet dense cream cheesecake gave it just the right amount of sweet and tart.  Plus, there was a layer of lemony mousse that brought this dessert together with the  meringue.  Yes, folks, I DID share this with my husband who isn't much of a dessert eater but somehow, it disappeared in front of him faster than me! Yay for National Cheesecake Day and I can't wait for it to come around next year.  We enjoy going to TCF and shouldn't just wait for this promotion to return and neither should YOU!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=80,3.4,3.43,3.528,3.408,3.418

It took us about an hour wait as we finally got in there was a crowd of people hovering the hostess area waiting to be seated I thought the point of have the buzzer was to avoid the crowed area at the hostess area. When you walk in it is very dark.  We started our meal with 2 appetizers the calamari and the tempura spicy ahi roll. The spicy ahi roll was DELICIOUS.  I would come back and get 2 orders of that.  As for our entree the boyfriend had the steak Diane with shrimp scampi and I had the steak Diane with herb crusted salmon. I don't know much about salmon but when I think salmon I think pink. But it was white and didn't really taste like salmon more of a mahi mahi taste. Idk it might have been just me. But the sauce the salmon was in had a strong lemon sour taste to it while the steak for my plate was tougher then my liking. The mashed potatoes were amazing super creamy and not chalky at all.  Over all experience it was okay probably will not be back for a couple years. The fried spicy ahi roll was the best part of our dinner and will probably be the reason I'll come back. It might have been the food that I ordered that made it and okay experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=300,3.2,3.41,3.504,3.5,3.326

The Lines were relatively short (15-20mins tops) for such a busy place, and they just have one bench to wait inside, but there is lots of space outside where you can sit and comfortably wait!  The service was ok, our server was Muhammad S., he forgot to give us our drinks (which were water) before our appetizers came through, but the lady that dropped our food was kind enough to get them for us right away, so that was nice! I think it was the manager that stopped by shortly after to apologize, it really wasn't a big deal though, Muhammad refilled our drinks often enough from then on and was relatively aware so YAY!  The food was AMAZING as always, makes it all worth it so kudos to the cooks, they're the real MVPs! It did take FOREVER for it to come, but it only makes sense with such a big busy restaurant.  As for the seats, this definitely isn't a place you go with a date, so make sure that you request a more private booth or something, you're better off finding more privacy sitting at the bar! The seats for 2 are actually a booth on one side and a chair on the other and these are in a row with maybe 2ft in between each set. I could literally hear CLEARLY every conversation from the couple next to me on both sides and the ones next to them and next to them.

Sauce had zero flavour shrimp were way over cooked and to top it out our waitress was a huge snake. We ordered way too much food and didn't eat much of it so we asked to get the food we didn't touch packed up, she didn't mention but it was so we could give it to the homeless people out front of our hotel. The woman rolled her eyes as she smiled sure . Tossed the plate on the desk and went to mention it to a male server as she looked over at us and he rolled his eyes too . As she returned with our bags of food she saw the appetizer we had packed up and was like "" oh right I forgot I already had to pack something for you here's another bag"" and just slid it on the table and walked away shaking her head .

Then, another 20 minute wait came the entrees, but no salad.  We asked Eric H. for bread and about the salad.  He said that he thought we wanted the Chicken Piccatas instead of the Chinese Chicken Salad, but what he ""thought"" and what we said were not the same.   Service was very slow. Very Disappointing!  This was a terrible dining experience! Not how I remember the Cheesecake Factory Waikiki in the past.  We wanted to order Cheesecakes, but decided to order it on our way out at the counter display because we didn't want to wait another 20+ minutes.   The entrees were good, but the Arnold Palmers and Shirley Temples were terrible.

We knew it would be awhile to be seated so we waited an hour and half so we could all sit together. While we waited, we saw plenty of smaller tables open up but waited to sit together and the hostess kept reassuring us that we could sit together as well. When we were finally called to be seated, we were ushered to TWO BOOTHS that were back to back that sat 6 each. Really?!?!?! Why did we wait for an hour and a half while looking at various empty 6 tops??  But ok. We decided to grin and bear it and sat down. There was one kid at each table. We decided to order the kids meals first since we had waited quite a while and they were getting antsy. Those were placed and then my table ordered all the drinks and appetizers. We got our drinks and then decided to order our dinner. The table I sat at received 2 appetizers in about 20min. We did not care for the deep fried macaroni since it was burnt and wanted to send it back. So we waited and waited and waited for the waitress to come back. We she finally came back we decided to ask about the kids meal since it has yet to come out. She said she would find out, get us refills and then she disappeared again.  An hour and some change after we sat down we have no food, no drinks, no kids meal and burnt macaroni balls. We are all getting agitated because the little girl at my table was starting to get fussy as well. Waitress comes back, without refills and says she apologizes but they are waiting for my Filet Mignon to finish. I laughed because I ordered it medium rare and two people ordered salads. Waiting for it to cook? After this comment my friends were over it. The manager did not offer much condolence since he stated he could not locate our food or drinks. We asked for our checks, cashed out and left.  The funny part is, our partner table had FINISHED their meals by the time we got fed up and decided to leave.

197,Fran C.,"Honolulu, HI",460,954,11214.0,4.0,2016-11-25,"It's been years since I've been to The Cheesecake Factory! And I wanna say I probably haven't been back here for over 10 years or so........ I remembered a time when The Cheesecake Factory had first opened in Waikiki back in 2003, and I went with my ohana to dine here several times.  All I remembered about The Cheesecake Factory was that they served pretty simple food, they gave huge portions, & the cheesecake was legit! It's now 2016, so I decided to come back here for lunch with a friend, as I figured if I go here during the weekday, it wouldn't be too crowded. Sure enough this place is still popular as when we arrived just before the opening time of 11:00 AM, there was a long line of customers waiting by the entrance door.  Lucky for us, since the restaurant is huge, we did not have to wait at all, and was seated right away. Shortly after, our server stopped by to drop off menus, & take our drink order.  After checking out the menu, I decided to get the - Super Antioxidant Salad which was a delicious blend of salad greens, spinach, kale, avocado, broccoli, grapes, roasted pear, blueberries, onion, sunflower seeds & almonds, with a lemon-blueberry vinaigrette dressing. I also added some grilled chicken to my salad to boost my protein intake.  With my salad, I ordered an ice tea to wash all of this down. My friend ended up ordering the - The Classic Burger, which was a gigantic chop house hamburger. Served with a slice of grilled onion, lettuce, tomato and you can either get french fries, or green salad. Which my friend ended up with the green salad. Of course when you go to The Cheesecake Factory, you have to order some of their delicious cheesecakes! They have such a large selection of cheesecakes, I have to admit, it's pretty hard to decide on which cheesecake to order.  At the end, I ordered the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake - which was a Banana Cream Cheesecake topped with bavarian cream, and it came with fresh sliced banana.  My friend got the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake - which was layers of creamy vanilla bean cheesecake, vanilla mousse & it was topped with whipped cream. What can I say about the grub? I really loved my Super Antioxidant Salad! It was the perfect meal which didn't leave me bloated, or too full..........having that salad saved me some space in my tummy for dessert! (See, you gotta plan your eating!).  The salad was not only pleasant to look at, but also the mixture of greens with the dressing was the perfect match! The grilled chicken was kinda bland, but I just ordered it to boost my protein intake, so I was okay with it! My friend enjoy the burger.........and the side salad was good too! As for the cheesecake desserts.............there is nothing bad tasting on their cheesecake menu. Whatever you order here, you cannot go wrong!  Overall, the prices for the food here at The Cheesecake Factory is kinda pricey for lunch, as I paid $58.00 for lunch (with tip), but the service here was great! Our server was very attentive, refilled our drinks, & checked on us often.

I've eaten here a couple of times and the wait is always horrendous. It's always been at least an hour. This latest time, I was quoted half an hour and was seated within the half hour. Yay! I prefer coming for lunch. Their dinner portions are huge. I like to come for their lunch specials. It's pretty much what they serve for dinner, but at smaller portions and cheaper prices. I love their Chinese Chicken Salad. I always, always get the Miso Salmon on mashed potatoes. It's the best Miso Salmon I've ever had in my life. The miso is slightly sweetened and contains mirin. Even though it's the lunch portion, I still can't finish it. I take the leftovers for my dinner.  My favorite cheesecake is White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut. This time I decided to try the Fresh Strawberry. Both are good, but go with the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut. It sounds sweet, but it really isn't.

Anyways, I always thought they ONLY did pasta dishes because my friends always told me their pastas are good, but NOPE!  Cheesecake Factory (according to our server) makes everything using fresh ingredients. Their menu is ginormous. They have so many options, and the pages in the menu seem endless. I ended up going with pasta, my sister had a burger, one friend had the chicken parm, and the other one had a soup+salad combo. Everyone enjoyed. The service was good, and fast.  Price was pretty high end, but I expect that being in Waikiki. I usually do not order pasta because it's so cheap and the mark-up. I probably won't order a pasta next time, because my wallet can't handle that lol. But I'd try some of the other items.  Their cheesecake, you can order at the table or by the front where their displays are. They have a lot of variety you can pick from. I am also assuming all cheesecakes are also made from fresh ingredients every day. I like their texture because they're so light and airy, not the grocery store brand where it's heavy and thick. Sometimes they have seasonal flavors, like peppermint bark for Christmas season. Their Pumpkin spice sticks around from Oct-Dec.  Parking: Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center validates for them.  If you go for dinner, get there early. They can get packed and the wait can be for 2+ hours. I would avoid during long weekends or holidays.  ALSO if you have issues with tables being so closed to yours, you probably don't want to come here, as someone can be RIGHT behind you.

Trust me, it gets really overwhelmed with their options. This location is also one that can't be beaten. Right in the heart of Waikiki and near the Sheraton hotel was so easy to get too.

347,Esther S.,"Kapolei, HI",56,57,99.0,4.0,2016-12-06,"Oh how I've been craving some cheesecake. After talking about it for months since my husband has never eaten here and it's been years since I've eaten here. We finally put the talk into action and drove all the way into Waikiki. Not that it's hours of driving but when you live on Oahu anything not 10min away is a long drive...haha. Parking is in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center. We failed to do our research and ended up in line at their prime time on a Sunday evening. The wait time was 45min. Normally, we wouldn't wait that long for a table, but we drove all this way for some cheesecake and we were not back out now. Upon check-in, you're given a pager. Luckily, there are several places in that area, so the wait time didn't seem too bad. We walked around the shopping center.  Next thing you know, we're being paged. So off we head to the front of the line, handed our pager over and was guided to wait on the side to wait for our someone to seat us. Once our name was called, we anxiously followed our hostess to our seat. How disappointing it was to be seated just behind the counter at the bar. It was loud and very dim. I'm not sure if the rest of the restaurant is as dim but it was dark enough that I had to hold the menu up close to read it. After waiting all that time, we opted to have our dessert first. I was pretty adamant about that because when we go out to eat we usually are so stuffed from our food that we end up passing on the dessert...well not this time. I had the white chocolate raspberry truffle and my husband had the Salted caramel. Both were delicious but I thoroughly enjoyed mine better. You can not go wrong with white chocolate and raspberry in my opinion. We then ordered the Kalua pork nachos...so yummy, so yummy! After skimming through the menu, I was so undecided on what I wanted to eat because there was so much to choose from. I decided to wait, since the nacho portion size was so big. My husband ordered the Hibachi steak. And it was very flavorful. I had a few bites of my hubbys plate and opted not to order a meal because I was stuffed. Of course we ordered a cheesecake to go, we went with the dutch apple caramel streusel. My husband swears he had his cheesecake fix. But I found my cheesecake the next day half eaten by him.

471,Kayla C.,"Lihue, HI",185,9,10.0,3.0,2016-12-08,"Honestly, The Cheesecake Factory was one of my all time favorite restaurants, but suddenly my experience there was absolutely different from all of the amazing nights I've had.  Although, this restaurant does not take any reservations, we've waited for 2 hours to get a table, which is normal if you wanna eat there. I told myself ""the wait will be worth it"", since they've never failed me. Perhaps, I spoke too soon. Our hostess was very polite and casually spoke to me about her favorite dishes on the menu and recommended me her favorite ""Chicken Madeira""-chicken breast, topped with mushrooms, asparagus, Madeira sauce, mozzarella cheese, side of mash potatoes. A pretty big size! So I figure I try it! They first give you bread and butter to start with, which is always my favorite! Cocktails are always tasty there! Bartenders are really good! Our appetizers were awesome, except we ordered the soup of the day- ""baked potato soup"". At first, our server said that they ran out, they she came back to let us know the kitchen was making a brand new batch so we stuck with the order. Soup came, and it was watery and didn't care for it anymore. It wasn't really a big deal for us, and didn't expect the manager to come by to apologize and offered us a free cheesecake which was really nice of them. My entree came in first, and wondered why the other dish hasn't come in at the same time. Server mentioned that the pasta was given to a different table and making a new one. So the manager came by again to apologize so the delay. As we began to eat, I looked at our food and it looked so good and smelled really good as well! I've eaten a quarter of my meal until I notice a hair on my food. I didn't realize that until I started cutting more of my chicken, and I was pretty upset and, yet, I was pretty hungry. I've told the server about the issue and told the manager. I ended up eating the pasta to share and didn't want to order a new entree. Manager was apologetic again, and I've never experienced this at the restaurant ever, so it really brought me by surprise.  I truly must say, our server was very understandable and she was really nice and apologetic of our experience. I've given this restaurant a 3 star because I feel that although our service was meaningful, the food and the duration wasn't at its best during the time.  Overall experience, parking will be difficult to find, since you need to find a good parking rate and walk to Cheesecake Factory. They do not take reservations, it's a walk-in restaurant that will make you wait 1.5-2hrs. Service by the servers were good, hostess service was good, management team is good. We were just disappointed of the experience after being loyal customers to this restaurant for many years. I'd still recommend this restaurant, but I'd hope on our next visit, it'd be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=320,3.88,3.69,3.596,3.2120000000000006,3.766

393,Jane H.,"Portland, OR",2,32,99.0,1.0,2016-12-18,"Posted on Yelp 12/10/16 Saturday night. My friends & I decided to eat at this place the night before the Honolulu marathon. Our waitress was the WORST & the MANAGER was too!!! They were both ignorant, arrogant, & rude!!! 1. My friend & I decided to share our food, ordering a pizza & pasta. When she took our order, we told her that we wanted the BBQ pizza & the garlic noodles but with a creamy sauce instead. She said she wasn't sure if that can be done bc it will change the taste but I told her it was ok if it did. She tried to argue with me what I wanted so she said she'll ask the chef (she had an attitude at this time) When she came back, she brought out the manager (Marshall).  I explained to him that we liked what's included in the pasta (fresh asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, oven-roasted tomatoes) but to change the sauce to creamy. He recommended the Pasta carbonara, I told him that yes I like the sauce but I didn't want to pay extra for the veggies. He said the veggies was not the problem for cost but for the sauce.  Sauce in Hawaii is expensive.  I repeated myself telling him that I didn't want to pay extra for the veggies & he said ""yes"" 2. Free bread was brought out & of course we ate it leaving couple of the darker ones,so when she came around she saw that someone else already brought out the bread  so she skipped us.  I flagged her down & ask if we can get more bread.  She looked at me with an ugly, mean attitude 'like seriously, you wanted more bread look'.  Even my friends saw her look & was surprise. 3. Food came out, all was good. 4. Obviously we couldn't eat all of our pizza & pasta so I asked her if we could get some boxes & she said ""what??""  With an ugly, nasty attitude!!! Again, we all looked at each other & said what is her problem??!! 5. The Check came out - We were charged (not a surprise! )for the veggies that I specifically told the manager Marshall before placing my order that I didn't want to pay extra for the veggies! She said it was the manager who rang our check. Low & behold, he came out telling me that ""this is a one time courtesy that he was not charging for the veggies"" I told him that I didn't want to pay extra for the veggies & he agreed not to charge me before I placed my order. He had the audacity to say that he didn't say that, he said that veggies are expensive.  What the HELL!!! He basically called me a liar!!! We were all stunned by what he said!  I told him that I will not be coming back & he basically said whatever & didn't give a $hit!! Seriously the worst service by the waitress & the manager by the name of Marshall!!!! I understand that they get a lot of tourist & they probably don't give a damn for all the tourist but please don't lie to the people who pays for your salary!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=240,3.6,3.59,3.584,3.0440000000000005,3.5940000000000003

Of all the years that the restaurant has been around I have only dined there three times.  First time was lunch with my cousin from South Carolina and her friend from California along with their young daughters.  Second time was dinner after the Breakout Waikiki outing with friends.  My last visit was to have early Christmas dinner with friends. On my most recent visit I was with seven other individuals and we sat in the back end of the restaurant closer to the Royal Hawaiian.  Complimentary bread and water was delivered to the tables.  Menus were already placed on the tables. I had to study the menu since I was undecided of what to order.  Should I order pasta, burger, sandwich, steak, or seafood dishes.  I opted to order the Shrimp Scampi with Steak Diane.  The dish comes with mashed potatoes.  I didn't know that I ordered the same dish as one of my dinner companions. My dinner was delicious.  My dinner companions noticed since I cleaned the entire plate minus the gravy.  Did I have room for dessert...nope.  I was stuffed from my meal and the complimentary bread.  Plus I drank two full cups of water.

Now, besides my mouth watering salad, I need to do a shout out to our man and best Waiter ever Mathew S.  He was quick, attentive, and even went beyond the call to ensure our needs were meant.  He not only got us fed, he somehow bonded with us as he wrapped with our sons about surfing and enjoying the simple things in life.  That boy needs a raise!  But till he gets that we have him a bit extra on top of the usual 20% because he deserved it. I'm again a full and happy girl.  Yay me. ------------------------------------------- The best customer service I have ever had here!  Havi gave us exactly what we wanted and more.  Since I'm always too full for dessert I did cheesecake first.  Went with the classic strawberry cheesecake.  Perfect as always.   For dinner we had Shrimp Scampi with extra garlic and cream.  Also with extra sauce on the side.  OUR FAVORITE!  A must for garlic and cream pasta lovers.  The shrimp was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  Large shrimp- about 6.   I also did a falafel salad.  It was HUGE.  Very light and chopped well- very uniformly chopped.  The falafel a we're not tradition.  The chickpeas were finely ground and rolled into balls.  Not what I'm used to, but taste great.  Would do again.  BUT, so huge that if it isn't your main course you should share.

So we basically came in at the perfect time but when we left after 430ish PM they eventually got a line & people were waiting. Our male server (forgot his name :( ) was amazing until we got another server, which a woman took his place. We first started off with 3 appetizers with him. We started off with the fried calamari, the spicy ahi tempura roll & fried Mac & cheese. When he came back to check up on us & asked if we wanted to order any entrees, we were not ready & decided to take time to eat the appetizers. About 30 minutes in, I believe, that's when our servers got switched. She asked if we been here before & I said I been here before but it was my boyfriends first time here. Towards the ending of our food, she said something like ya you never been here before something like that which I took that as a rude compliment. Like I'm from here & I been here like a long time ago & yes I did say that I been here before but she didn't have to accuse me of lying that I never had been here before. I totally forgot that the plates were big & that she didn't have to make such a rude remark. Even my boyfriend said that was rude of her for saying such a thing, but whatever's.

Delicious food, generous portions, and cheesecake for days--what's not to love, right? As if that weren't enough, it gets better! They usually do a deal around Thanksgiving/Christmas time where for every $25 in electronic gift cards you purchase from their website, you receive two complimentary slices of cheesecake--to gift or to keep! Seeing how a slice of cheesecake costs between $7.50 and $8.95, this is a super sweet deal! I came here for lunch twice within the past month so I could redeem my complimentary slices (they expire by March 31). I ordered the regular portion of Pasta Da Vinci both times because it's just that good! It's simple--sautéed chicken, mushrooms, and onions in a delicious Madeira wine sauce tossed with penne pasta and Parmesan--but so undeniably unforgettable. I will totally order this again and again even though there are SO many tempting menu items! I don't think you can go wrong with any of their cheesecakes. I recently tried their fresh strawberry, mango key lime, and lemoncello cream torte, and all of them were divine.

They are located in Waikiki in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center on the ground level. Parking is pretty convenient in the parking garage. They don't take reservations so you have to go and sign in. You are probably going to wait to be seated, but while you are waiting you can go and check out all the cheesecakes they have for sale. The menu is quite extensive, with appetizers to full on meals, so take your time and choose carefully!! Many of the appetizer portions are big enough to share, so that's another way to order, you can share with your dining companions!! The pizzas and sandwiches are great, but my personal favorite happens to be an appetizer! You gotta have the Spicy Ahi Tempura Rolls. This is some serious deliciousness! It's served on a bed of deep fried long rice and served with two different sauces. Enough for two! The dining companion swears by the shrimp rolls, which isn't really a favorite of mine, but hey, to each his own!! We will usually order a pizza to split also. Great service and friendly interaction with the waitstaff make dining at Cheesecake Factory an enjoyable time. A little noisy in there, but a great place to sit down to some great food and conversation.

544,Shae B.,"Kailua, HI",0,32,12.0,3.0,2017-03-12,"I called the restaurant in the morning to ask if they take dinner reservations for large parties (it's normally walk in only but I figured since we had 20 people, I figured the could accommodate us with a reservation) and the women said no. I asked how long the wait would be for a party that large and she said, ""anywhere from 20 minutes to 3 hours, we don't take reservations."" So I was a little irritated and told her that I thought it was ridiculous for a restaurant to not want to accommodate a large party like that and then said thank you, to only hear the phone slam down and see my call ended. Not sure who I spoke to, couldn't get a name because she hung up on me. Later that evening, one person from our party went down early and put our name down at 5:30pm which ended up only being 10 of us because the rest of the party could not make it. They told him that the wait would be 90 minutes to 2 hours. Our entire party was staying at the Hilton so we decided we'd catch a cab to the restaurant by 6:30pm and would only have to wait 30 minutes, and hour at the most because of the estimated wait time. At 6:30pm, we got a call that our table was ready. We hopped in a cab and headed down there, only to be stuck in traffic. The person in our party said they would only hold it for 10-15 minutes, after that, they were giving our table away. We knew we weren't going to make it in time so we called and asked to speak to a manager. The manager said that they gave the table away but when we get there, we'll be the first to be seated with the next table opening. We waited for about 45 minutes until we were called to be seated. The host told us, ""I know it says you don't want your party to be split but my manager Stephanie wrote void on here and we have you in separate booths behind each other."" Because we were tired of waiting and hungry we just said whatever yeah we'll take it. When we were seated, the booths were split 4 and 6 and we did not like the seating at all. My Mom asked to speak to a manager. Jen (manager) walked over and said she was going to try and get us a table all together. The waitress Bianca, not really aware of what was going on was sassy and had an attitude. When she found out we were moving, she said, ""well I'm not gonna put in your order until I know if you're moving or what's gonna happen."" After 10 minutes, we were moved to a table that could accommodate us all. Our new waiter, Ken, was very friendly. He checked on us frequently and made sure we were all good on waters, bread, etc. Jen, the manager from earlier, came and also checked on us. Jen and Ken definitely turned our bad experience and night into a better one.

I brought it up to the women working the front desk and was told that busboys sometimes pulls people for the back bar when seats become available- this would've been believable if he didn't bypass other people to do so as well as bypass people that had already put their names down.

My bf and I came to Cheesecake Factory because the ones in California (specifically San Mateo) have been disappointing and we wanted this to be a redemption moment of some sort. We were seated immediately as it was past the lunch rush. Then comes our server being kind and racist at the same time. She slowly asked me if I wanted bread and water. At first I thought it was just her way of speaking, but it definitely wasn't. I ordered the pasta and my bf ordered the hawaiian pizza with a caesar salad. Again, at this point our server asked if I needed chopsticks. I'm eating pasta... so no.  Strangely enough, after our meal, while she waves goodbye to my boyfriend, she BOWS to me. What is that?

Thankfully, we were brought to a table outside in the front of the restaurant.  Inside, it seemed dark and loud.  So we were very pleased to be seated outside.  Plus, we got to people-watch all the Spam Jammers! Even though the restaurant was BUSY, our waitress was a dream!  Her name is Lily (from Houston) and she was a total gem.  Not only was she super helpful and accommodating, she truly seemed to enjoy her job.  She didn't seem harried or overwhelmed and took her time with us.  Offering to do spilt checks for a large group and even encouraging us to let her know if we needing anything modified.  She said she was the ""Queen of Modifications""!  And she was true to her word. The food came out in good time and Lily was there to check on us right as the food arrived. Me and one of my friends ordered the Rib-Eye steak, and we both ordered it Medium Rare.  Lily asked us both to cut open our steaks to make sure they were cooked properly.  Mine was fine, but my friends looked more Medium than Medium Rare.  Lily took one look and said, ""No way!  I'm taking this right back and making it right.""  I kid you not, my friend had another Rib-Eye sat before her within 3 minutes.  And it was cooked perfectly!  Lily made sure. Then the manager showed up at our table (can't remember his name...started with an S) because he had heard about the steak.  He just wanted to make sure everything turned out ok and we were all enjoying.   Lily took care of us for almost 2 hours.  Every detail, down to recommending cheesecake to each of us according to our liking.   I could go on and on....she was the best! My whole table of 8 women couldn't stop raving about her and the food and the service.  Each of us enjoyed the food immensely.   I was so impressed with the quality of service/food/attention we got...period.  Not to mention the fact that the place stayed packed from the time we got there until we left.

I love the salted caramel cheesecake (best one on the menu) if your not looking for too sweet and just to hit the spot kind of dessert",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=240,3.56,3.59,3.616,2.54,3.5780000000000003
683,Mike Z.,"Placentia, CA",0,2,,1.0,2017-05-30,Last week while on our honeymoon we decided to have dinner at the Cheesecake Factory in Waikiki. Obviously the waiting line was a mile long so we walked into the bar. When we noticed several empty tables we asked one of the employees if we could take one. We were told it was open seating in the bar and we could even order food in the bar so we sat down. A waiter came and took our drink order and then we told him we wished to order food. At that time we were told we had to leave the table because a hostess had not seated us. We explained what another employee had told us but he insisted that we must leave the table immediately or we would be removed. Are you kidding me! We are in our 60's and we were embarrassed and humiliated by this treatment. I will never step foot in a Cheesecake Factory again. Even if another employee had seated us by mistake they should have honored our patronage and counseled the employee later. There was no excuse for this.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=540,3.48,3.57,3.6,2.308,3.5340000000000003

It was so crowded so we ordered some food a cheesecake to go.  The lady said it was going to take about 30 min, so we walked over to the bar area and found some seats right away. In the future we'll probably just sit at the bar and order food instead of waiting for takeout.  I ordered a whiskey cocktail type of drink, which was pretty strong.

180,Nellie F.,"Honolulu, HI",344,116,483.0,4.0,2017-06-03,"Cheesecake factory to me is a classic. Their food quality is as great here as it is in every other franchise of theirs I've visited in different states. The lunch menu has a lot of items from the dinner menu, however they are a bit cheaper and smaller portions. Which may not be a bad thing because their dinner portions are HUGE! My mom and I shared the Louisiana Chicken pasta and had avocado egg rolls for starter. And of course we indulged in the complimentary and well-loved fresh Brown and Sourdough bread.  The food was all fresh and hot. The pasta comes al dente (a bit chewy) unless you tell them otherwise. I prefer mine fully cooked but forgot to mention this time. The pasta dish was also nice and spicy with the chicken well seasoned and cooked. The servers also ask if you would like fresh Parmesan cheese on your food (love it)! The avocado egg rolls were so good! Fried but not greasy at all, and nice and hot. The dipping sauce for them is very unique - kind of sweet/herbal but a great compliment to the taste of the rolls. We didn't leave room for dessert that day, but I know from several previous visits that their desserts are magnificent! They don't have their own parking garage nor valet, but they do validate for the Royal Hawaiian parking garage. The restaurant also gets RIDICULOUSLY busy right around 5pm with wait times sometimes upwards of an hour and a half, so come early if you can.

The lady that answered said they do not take rsvps and that in order to get a table, we would have to walk in. We arrived at about 5:30 and told the ladies at the front desk that we were having 6 people. She gave us a pager and said that we would be seated in about 30 minutes. We went to the bar to drink. Bryce was our bartender and the only good thing to come out of our dinner there. He was very chill and made our drinks to perfection (5 stars for Bryce). Our friends forgot their wallet in their car and left for 5 minutes to get it. (Their car was in the parking garage by Ross). The pager beeped and we went to get seated. The usher gave us a SUPER hard time about our table EVEN THOUGH OUR PARTY WAS THERE and told us we only could have a 5 minute wait window otherwise he would give up our table and we would have to wait on the list AGAIN. I told him nicely that they went to get their wallet and we still had 4 of the 6 there already. He still wouldn't sit us! Finally after a lot of going back and forth and he saw our party, he finally sat us and had an attitude about it. I asked him to get me a manager because I did not appreciate him being an a**hole to me or my party (manager never made it to our table).  Our server was ""interesting"". We waited about 20 minutes for our first round of drinks and water. Everytime we tried to order the next round of drinks, she would only take 2 orders and leave the table. My girlfriend and I waited over 30 minutes just to order another set of daiquiris! Same thing for the food order (she took half the party's order then left and took the rest). One of our friends waited 30 minutes after we got our appetizers and entrees before her food got to us.

Told us 45 mins and we had to wait 1hour and 45 mins. We were then sat all the way in the back of the patio, it's hot and stuffy and the temperature difference from walking through the restaurant to where they sat us was at least 10-15 degrees. I tried to move us to the table near an opening to outside instead of the wall and rudely was told ""You can't just move, there may be someone else assigned to the table!""   When I asked if there were any other tables inside I was told it would be another 20 mins. NO WAY! So we sat in the dark stuffy corner (on our family vacation - once in a lifetime trip in HI with all 4 of my kids)  Turns out ""rude guy"" was our server... I ordered Parmesan crusted chicken and the server said they were out of that. I was starting to think I was being filmed on WWYD? I ended up ordering appetizers since I didn't want anything else on the menu. He just gave me a disgusted look, shook his head and asked ""you don't want ANYTHING else?"" ... are you kidding me. The manager came over a few mins later and said he ""heard"" we were not happy.  I explained the ridiculous long wait, the unfavorable table, the chicken that I ordered was out. He apologized for the chicken being out of stock and again offered me to order something else. When I told him ""no thank you"" he offered me complimentary cheesecake. Not for the 3 of of us that ordered cheesecake but just 1. It was an anniversary trip, family vacation. We had bad services, unfriendly staff and food is mediocre.

There are so much food places to choose from in Waikiki, but we settled on this establishment because we both agreed that it's been years since either one of us ate here. As always, there's a lot of people waiting and there is almost always a wait time. But for a party of two, we waited about 15-20 minutes which isn't that bad at all.

218,Evan K.,"Honolulu, HI",165,11,20.0,5.0,2017-07-03,"Even though Cheesecake Factory is a ""chain"" restaurant, the experience doesn't feel like that at all.  The menu is a novel, but that basically means there's something for everyone.  My personal favorites are the following (all 9/10 or 10/10 dishes in my opinion): Fried Calamari: The breading is light and flaky, comes with a garlic aioli sauce and marinara sauce.  Sometimes it can be a bit too salty, but 9 times out of 10 it's a good dish. Caesar Salad: The ""appetizer"" size feeds about 3-4 people; when my parents and I get the calamari and Caesar salads, we're full by the time our entrees come. Factory Nachos: The tortilla chips are really tasty and unique, the cheese sauce has hints of American cheese if that's your thing, but there are also Mexican cheeses as well.  Comes with guac, sour cream, and a lot of other fixings.   Fish Tacos (tempura style): Four fish tacos that comes with Spanish rice and beans. Cuban Sandwich: Ham, Swiss cheese, kalua pig, mustard, and pickles. California Cheese-Steak Sandwich: Basically steak, cheese, and peppers; simplicity is sometimes a good thing. Pasta Da Vinci: I get this with linguine (originally comes with penne, which I don't think absorbs the sauce as well); comes with chicken and mushrooms in a wine sauce. Now...for the CHEESECAKES: S'Mores Cheesecake and Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake.  I love the graham cracker crust on the S'Mores Cheesecake.  Get both and have your stomach thank me later. Go early for lunch (~11AM/12PM) if you want to beat the lines , or early dinner time (~5PM/6PM) as this place gets packed.  Otherwise, call ahead for takeout is your best bet. One last note on customer service: I feel like Cheesecake Factory definitely puts an emphasis on this when they train their employees (sometimes you can just tell).  Over the several years I've been going to this location, I have never had a bad customer service experience - I also want to give a thank you to one cashier (I believe her name was Nicole), who comped us a cheesecake after my girlfriend and I noticed we were missing salad dressing in our takeout order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=60,2.92,3.5,3.556,3.604,3.2680000000000002

Food: After drooling all day over their exhaustive menu, we decided to order the avocado egg rolls (always a winner!) and I ordered the chicken and biscuits. Touted as comfort food, with the ""best"" buttermilk biscuits on the side, this dish was what I was craving. The portions of chicken, vegetables and mashed potatoes were generous, and the pan gravy was savory but not over-salted. Hints of sage and white pepper flavored the gravy nicely. But the buttermilk biscuits...? Maybe I haven't visited a lot of places in the South to know how true buttermilk biscuits should look and taste. However, I've made and had enough biscuits (just look at me) to know what I like in a good one: a crispy exterior, some layered flakiness, and some ""elevation""or height to show the baking powder and soda are doing their thing. Unfortunately, these were not the ""best."" While the exterior of these was crisp, their lack of height and rather doughy insides told me that they had wilted like a bouffant hairdo in today's high heat and humidity.  Dessert was a shock for me. Never before had I considered ordering the low carb cheesecake, but since I was full from the appetizer and entree I decided to try it. Mind you, it weighs in at around half the calories of the other cheesecakes so I was feeling quite sanctimonious... It was nice and light, almost mousse-like, with a thin walnut graham crust sweetened with Splenda. Nice! Service: Our server Brandi was awesome. She embodied friendly attentiveness. She was even sensitive to our birthday girl and asked if she wanted them to sing or not.

The food was delicious as always but since it was towards the end of service, I don't feel like the server was too engaged or attentive. Me and the lady ordered the Farfalle with chicken and garlic and the Pasta Da Vinci, respectively. The Farfalle pasta was on point, the sauce was creamy and savory, and seasoned just right. The Pasta Da Vinci was alright, I feel that the sauce was to heavy on the wine side. The service was lacking. My friend Marie, is a vegetarian, but her order came with meat. The waitress was nice enough though to comp her meal. Water was refilled once, and we didn't even get a refill on bread.  Overall service put a damper on an otherwise delicious meal, put up with it if you are willing to wait.

Your stomach will eat itself before you even get your meal. I guess if you eat at some abnormal time then you'd be lucky with no wait.  I tend to do take out more often now. They have a garage with validated parking, but the garage is so far! It's like a hike to get there and back! If you have a buddy it'll be better cause you can park on the side. I usually call it in as I'm doing my hike. Sometimes there's a wait at the cashier to pay anyway for a take out order.  Want anything extra? Like brown bread? Just ask! They'll gladly pack it up for you!! Today I was on hold for a bit but the cashier was friendly once I was able to place an order in, despite how busy they are!  You can also order a jar of dressing to go! But beware!! They're made fresh on the daily so they go bad within two days.. I mean really bad! And sour! So make sure you're willing to eat a lot of salad! Or have some kind of party! Their Caesar dressing is so good!

406,Lia W.,"Honolulu, HI",14,40,38.0,1.0,2017-09-07,"It was around 3:52 pm on a Thursday afternoon. I had placed a phone order for three items and was told that it'd take around 15-20 min for pick up. The girl who took my order didn't bother reading back to me my order. And I thought it was strange. Then before I could ask her to do that she hung up on me. I thought they were busy so I gave them 25 minutes and when I showed up at the pick up counter, one item was missing. So the girl who helped me at the counter had told me she didn't take my order as she had just started her shift. I said no problem. How much longer for that one missing item? She said another 10 minutes but I ended up waiting another 20 minutes for it. Then an older guy showed up. He was apologetic and offered to talk to the girl who took my order but he didn't offer to comp a dessert or anything for causing me inconvenience. They weren't even busy at all when I showed up. Total wait time 45 minutes for a phone order. On top of that, their validation on my parking ticket still costed me $6 to park for less than one hour in the Royal Hawaiian shopping center. If their food wasn't just okay, I would not have given them even 1 star for this review. The 1 star is for the food. The customer service here DEFINITELY needs a lot of work for an establishment who has been here for a while. Staff needs lots of training and the manager needs to be more sincere about the oversight by comping the customer WITHOUT HAVING TO BE TOLD TO DO SO. They need to make sure their validation stamp WORKS! The takeaway here is ALWAYS ASK them to repeat your orders back to you BEFORE they hang up on you and ASK THE MANAGER to comp a dessert or something for your time wasted.

Pleasant surprise. After we were sat, our waitress was very prompt with out drinks. She gave us bread as well and then took our order. I ordered pasta without meat, when all of our food came out, as my husband had his flash on for Snapchat to record the well presented food that just arrived at our table waiting for fresh stinky cheese to me grated on top of it. As the flash of light went over my food I noticed little pieces of meat in my pasta. I told the man who dropped the food off that was grading the cheese and he said, Where??,"" as if I was lying or was mistaken. I know to check my food now because there has been countless times when there is meat in my food when I had already requested from the wait staff for there not to be meat in my food.  Anyhow, he took the food back, our waitress walked by and probably noticed that I did not have my food and failed to ask why. Then when they brought me a new meatless pasta, she came to our table asking why it took so long... Hm... She said very offensively that she is ""VEGAN! And it is not her fault!"" I was not blaming her. I simply stated that it had meat in my pasta.  As a result they took my food off the bill, thank you, and the food was good. No big deal. I wasn't expecting my food to be taken off. I was a little sad we didn't get a second serving of bread, but we probably didn't need it anyways.

254,Derrick L.,"Mililani, HI",23,2,,2.0,2017-10-23,"We've been to this Waikiki Cheesecake Factory many times, and the service and food is always outstanding and is worth the 1 hour wait. We went there last night and was happy to know that the wait was only 30 minutes. Our waitress was Bianca who seemed more like a robot who showed very little personality, customer service and never smiled. Almost like she wanted off that night but was forced to work kind of attitude.  My wife was the only one that ordered a salad, which came quickly. But within 5 minutes our entrees arrived including hers. Why bring a person's entree when you just got your salad? When my wife told them that she's still eating her salad, the waiter asked if she'd like for them to hold her meal in the kitchen while she finished her salad. My wife agreed that would be best. About 5 minutes later Bianca told my wife it would be best if she could take her entree now or it'll be cold. It wasn't my wife's fault, so why the choice of either now or cold food? They should have made her a new dish when she was done with her salad. We also never got our complimentary bread as we usually got in the past.  When Bianca told us of the specialty cheesecakes, she rattled them off so quickly like it was something she was forced to do rather wanting to tell us about. We ordered our deserts and also one coffee. The deserts came but not the coffee.  Overall, the food was good as usual. I always order the chicken picatta, which I haven't found better at any other restaurant. It was just the service last night was terrible. That's why the wait was only 30 minutes, it's because they skip the bread, bring the food out while you're still eating the salad, and Bianca was just a waitress robot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=80,3.72,3.55,3.612,3.208,3.6180000000000003

Portion sizes seem just right for majority of meals. The steaks melt in your mouth and I was even surprised at how much flavour they got out of the vegetables. The drinks are made very well, possibly best Lava Flow in Hawaii.  The lighting is dim and sets a great mood. The only downside is expect a long wait time during usual peak meal hours (1+ hour)  And of course experiences are different with different servers.

There were so many horrible things that the server has done, her name's Nicole. First of all, when she was giving our water, she didn't come to our table. She passed it over the little gate they had between the table and walk way. Secondly, when we were ordering our food she didn't repeat our orders back to us, so when we received our meal it was wrong. My friend ordered sweet potato fries instead and my other friend got a well done burger but got a medium well. Also, when I got my pasta they didn't offer if I wanted cheese..since that's why they usually would ask. So when she came back she just DRAGGED my plate which pushed my utensils to the side and made a loud noise. Like excuse me?! After that I was just so irritated. It was my friend's first time at cheesecake so he wanted to order a cheesecake but our server DID NOT INFORM us that she's taking last call for food or cheesecake. She just gave us our checks so I asked her if we could order cheesecake and she says ""they just closed, sorry about that."" We was so pissed, HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW WHEN LAST CALL IS?! I don't know if she's new or what but she was so horrible. So beware for shitty service if you do get this girl.

It was really good. You couldn't even taste the alcohol with the ice cream in it. The drink itself was pretty thick so it took a while to finish.  I ordered the miso salmon and it was perfect. The presentation was gorgeous! The salmon was perfectly cooked. It had a nice sweet and savory flavor and a nice flakiness to it. It was surrounded by this white sauce and some peas. The sauce was light and had a nice flavor. I couldn't tell what it was but it was good. I wish I had more peas though.  Of course, when you come here, you need to get dessert! I got the tiramisu cheesecake. It was awesome! Tasted like tiramisu and had the richness of a cheese.  The only hiccup was that they brought out the wrong pasta for my friend. A Cajun pasta instead of the Louisiana pasta. They were really nice though and came to apologize and offered a free soup or salad. They handled it well and brought it out in a reasonable time.

All three menu items were vegan and delicious. There are lots of vegetarian options, but NO dairy free or egg free desserts besides being offered ""a side of strawberries"". You'd think such a large company who specializes in cheesecakes would make at least one cheesecake that is vegan. This is the case for this establishment across the country, so it isn't a dig at this location, just an overall observation!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=40,3.96,3.88,3.636,,3.912
162,James S.,"Ayase, Japan",1,34,21.0,5.0,2017-12-22,"I had the macadamia crusted ono fish with vegetables. The fish had good flavor but it was very dry. The server was extremely attentive despite how crowed it was. Immediately after my first bite he appeared out of thin air to ask how we liked it. I informed him of the lack of moisture and he immediately offered a sauce to remedy the dish. I suggested honey mustard, which sounds like an unusual combo with ginger fish but it turned out that it complimented the ginger perfectly. My lovely date had shrimp pasta which also had very good flavor. But, the highlight of the night was the red velvet cheesecake. It was well worth the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu,3.96,3.88,3.64,,3.912
199,Danielle M.,"Waianae, HI",0,129,285.0,4.0,2017-12-23,Been here numerous times for lunch and dinner over the years. Be prepared to wait a hr or two if going for dinner. Lunch is easier wait times in the past was only 0-20 mins. Food is always great no matter what we order. Parking is a pain in Waikiki but we jus find the nearest garage which is on Royal Hawaiian and walk it.

188,Darin H.,"Aiea, HI",49,73,9.0,4.0,2017-12-25,"My family has a Christmas tradition of eating breakfast here. I suggest making reservations ahead of time or get here when it opens because it gets crowded fast especially on busy days. They serve complimentary honey oat wheat bread and white bread which are both delicious. I was surprised to find that the coffee here ain't that bad either. My family usually orders the cuts of steak and always recommend it. They have a wide selection of items to choose from so you have many choices. Service is always good, even when ordering takeout. Prices are what you would expect from a Waikiki restaurant. Fun fact, you can order their delicious bread for take out for just $3 and they give you a big loaf! The only thing that makes me take away a star is that takeout portions are much smaller than restaurant portions. Overall, never really had any significant problems with this restaurant and will continue to come back. 4 shakas out of 5!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=20,3.92,3.86,3.648,,3.8840000000000003
153,David T.,"Honolulu, HI",277,246,1909.0,3.0,2017-12-27,"Went to The Cheesecake Factory with friends on Christmas afternoon.  It was crowded and the wait was about an hour as we had expected. I decided on the Green Chicaquilles with pork.  They were good and the sauce flavorful. The plate was huge and was more than i could finish after having bread and butter while we waited for our orders. Everyone enjoyed their meal, however, there is some strange system of how they service a table by using multiple waiters.  We did have a large table, but we were never sure who was going to do what at the table. There were several order mistakes and some new person would show up and find that there was a problem, just to be followed by another person bring out the same mistaken dish again. Once our meal was finished, one got their checks right away, others had to wait 30 plus minutes before they could get someone to bring their check. I'm sure there is a method to the madness but we couldn't figure it out and neither could the waitstaff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu,3.84,3.84,3.648,,3.84

As the entrance is blocked with people waiting to get a pager; then the other side of the desk is crowded with people waiting to be seated.  Due to the great weather, outdoor seating is wonderful, especially when it's cool out with a light breeze.

299,Cynthia P.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,2.0,2018-01-07,"My family and I eat out together once a month and this month decided on The Cheesecake Factory (Jacksonville Florida). I have to say that out of all of the restaurants that we have eaten at, this experience was the worse!!! We had a party of 16 people so didn't mind the wait to be seated. However, after being seated,we did not get our food orders taken until an hour and 10 minutes later. The first waitress took our orders for drinks as soon as we were seated. However, though she passed our table several times to wait on other tables, she never returned to our table or even acknowledged that we were sitting there.  Only after stopping a waitress who just happened to be passing by our table did we finally get our orders taken and then we never saw her again. A third waiter kept filling us up with bread and butter. We never knew who exactly was assigned to our table. I asked to speak to a manager and the manager was condescendingly polite and nonchalant as if he could care less. We received no apology or compensation for the poor service and long wait. We were VERY disappointed after hearing so much about this supposedly great restaurant. It did not live up to the reputation. Maybe they just can't handle large parties. I really couldn't understand it. The food was okay but was not worth the poor service. The service and the lack of concern from the manager took away from what could have been a really nice and enjoyable meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=140,3.72,3.76,3.608,,3.7439999999999998
150,Olivia P.,"Honolulu, HI",213,22,27.0,4.0,2018-01-08,"I love cheesecake factory. My friends and I come at least once a month. Today however, I came with my family to celebrate my brothers birthday.  Located right in Waikiki at the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center, this place isn't hard to find. Parking is in the Royal Hawaiian parking structure and the restaurant validates for you. The first 2 hours with validation is free.  We went around 3:30 so we were able to get  seated right away. I think anytime before 5pm is a good time to go. Anytime after that, the wait jumps to over an hour long. We ordered the crab & artichoke dip as our appetizer. It was so good that it disappeared way too fast. They give a pretty good portion size of the dip as well. For our entrees we ordered the farfalle chicken pasta, chipotle chicken sandwich, a burger, and a soup & salad lunch combo. Everything tasted great!  The minus 1 star is for the priceyness of this place. It's a little on the pricier side. Nonetheless, I enjoy the food here. Definitely one of my go-to places to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu,3.68,3.79,3.608,,3.7460000000000004
