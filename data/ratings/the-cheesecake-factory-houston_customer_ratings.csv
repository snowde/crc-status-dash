138,Naomi T.,"Houston, TX",5,10,34.0,4.0,2012-02-14,"I recently moved to Houston with my man and this being his home town he was eager to show me around town. And of course it wouldn't be complete without a visit to the galleria. After wandering around the mall we had worked up an appetite and were eager to try the Cheesecake factory since neither of us had been. Our waiter was beyond superb. I had trouble deciding from the HUGE menu so i kept asking him for suggestions, much to his and my boyfriend amusement. I eventually decided on the burrito which was massive ( it lasted me for a whole nother meal after wards.) My boyfriend ordered the shrimp gumbo which was also Delicious. We both ate half of our big entrees then went on to desert. I eventually decided on the red velvet cheesecake which was amazing although a little too sweet. My man got the snickers cheesecake and liked it as well. Will definitely be back again in the future",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=400,3.48,3.48,3.48,3.536,3.4800000000000004

124,Todd S.,"Houston, TX",30,170,14.0,2.0,2012-03-04,"I've always felt like cattle when grazing, here.  There's usually a wait (?!?) for a table and then a wait for the farmer (aka, ""server"") to fill the feed trough with glorified fast food.  I cannot understand how/why people like this place.  This is boring, pre-fab food delivered to you by the same pre-fab staff you'll find at Chilis/etc.  It happens to cost a little bit more than the other McRestaurants... somewhat inexplicably.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=380,3.4,3.4,3.4,3.24,3.4000000000000004
457,Melissa G.,"Katy, TX",104,646,82.0,3.0,2012-03-05,"I just don't get what Houstonians see in this place - except for maybe dessert.   The majority of their food is okay, but that's about it.  I've ordered pasta dishes and found a few different types of pasta floating in with my entree - this doesn't really inspire me with confidence where their food quality is concerned.  It really makes me think that it is just like McDonalds, but you sit down to eat and the food is on a plate.  The menu never actually changes either - just the names of the items (our waitress told us this) or the pretty pictures of desserts scattered inside and out. The portions are huge.  If you have anything else to do while you are at the Galleria and know you won't be bringing any leftovers home, then most of the pasta, salad, and dinner entrees will be a waste of money for you.  If you want to leave the table without feeling bloated, then try a sandwich or burger with a small side-salad instead of the fries.  I did this for the first time on this visit and it is the first time I've left the restaurant and felt like I could continue to walk around comfortably.   The best thing about the Cheesecake Factory is that if I want a slice of cheesecake I can walk in, get my slice of cake to-go, and then walk out.  That's about it.  Otherwise, it's just a typical mediocre chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=260,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.372,3.3200000000000003

36,Megan M.,"Houston, TX",84,35,3.0,4.0,2012-03-12,"Here's the deal: I go to school far from home and I'm here for spring break. Not to mention my sister, her boyfriend, and my mom all decided on CCF so we can talk and have a nice meal. We didn't mind that the service wasn't AWESOME because we had our alone time (which I know seems quite backward).  1. My mom LOVES and ordered the Da Vinci. The pasta came out HARD/crunchy and tasted BURNT. so the waiter took it back and came out soft but still burnt taste. the manager offered to pay for her dessert (kinda weird he didn't offer to pay for her pasta).  2. Even though the waiter wasn't giving us the time of day, our food & drinks were pretty much given in a timely and appealing manner. Our glasses kept being filled and when we needed something, we got it. Not the BEST service.  3. for 4 people: 4 waters, 2 alcoholic drinks, 4 meals, 4 cheesecakes = $114. THIS IS AN AWESOME PRICE!!!! not only did we take ALL 4 meals home, we took home the cheesecake. so we had lunch & dinner paid for.  Decent experience. We all LOVED our food. This is definitely not the place to go if you want to get pampered by a waiter though.

412,Christina V.,"Houston, TX",234,230,355.0,4.0,2012-05-20,"This review is not about the food or drinks!  I have always loved The Cheesecake Factory, but today the service was below par for what I am used to receiving here so SERVICE is what my review is about.   I decided to eat here today for Sunday brunch and invited my best friend and her husband who are from Orlando.  I know there are plenty of Cheesecake Factory restaurants, but my best friend and I love The Cheesecake Factory and the Galleria area, so why not bring him here so they can eat delicious food while enjoy the view of Uptown Galleria area?  Well, we were seated by the hostess in a booth by the stairs on the second floor across from the elevator.  I asked if we could move closer to the window, but the hostess said they were reserved, but I thought that was odd because The Cheesecake Factory normally does not take reservations, unless I have been lied to every year when I plan to have my birthday dinners there and we all had to get there super early to get a table because I was told they do not take reservations.   There were small parties and some booths that were occupied near the windows, so we did not understand why they told us those tables were reserved.  We asked another hostess again just in case maybe the other hostess did not understand us the first time.  This time we were told that since it was still early (11AM on Sunday and they open at 10AM) they were understaffed so they couldn't seat us at those tables.  It was still puzzling, but we didn't want to make a scene about it.  It was disappointing to eat at a beautiful restaurant and not get to enjoy the views.  We came early with intentions that we could get a good table with a nice view and beat the rush, but instead we were not rewarded.  A few minutes into our meal, the tables by the windows were occupied.   I really don't understand what the issue was as to why we could not have been seated near a window, but I hope that in the future, the staff could be more understanding and give a better explanation for why guests cannot be seated where they request to be seated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=240,3.6,3.28,3.28,3.3120000000000003,3.4080000000000004

360,Tish P.,"Houston, TX",907,408,1021.0,5.0,2012-08-01,"the brown bread (and no I don't know what it's called) in the complimentary bread basket is the #2 reason I love this place. I can't think of any place where I like the bread more, nah not even the cheddar bay biscuits for the seafood lover in you place, that I jokingly refer to as Red Dumpster, since the food either looks like it belongs in the trash or just came out of it, in comparison to the pictures on the menu.  Moving right along, TCF's menu is too damn big, no way in hell you can't find anything appealing. My personal fav is the lemon herb roasted chicken. Juicy with a hint of tart from the lemon, it's divine and comes with carrots and mashed potatoes. Try the corn fritters for an app, delicious. Cobb salad, worth the price tag. NOT a fan of the cajun jambalaya pasta AT ALL, pass it up, save your cheddar, TRUST ME! I have friends in high places and know these things...believe me when I'm trying to hip you to the game!  Hold up partner, don't eat all that food they give you, one must save room for dessert when you come here. Strawberry cheesecake, yum...loves it...BUT my #1, I can't stay away, I dream about this cheesecake y'all, kahlua cocoa coffee. I'd like to imagine God himself created this cheesecake and broke off a slice from heaven just to share with his #1 angel (that would be me FYI)...it's so decadent and rich, made with layers of brownie, kahlua cheesecake, chocolate mousse, and chocolate ganache. Look me in the eyeballs and tell me that ish doesn't sound good! Yeah you can't do it, can ya...don't bother, just run and try it for yourself. The carrot cake is pretty decent, but that ain't my speed. It's big as hell but I don't come to TCF for that kinda cake!!!

I wound up ordering some sort of chicken pasta and a mojito.  My meal was ok but my majito was probably the best I have ever had. So good, I had to order another, but it was probably the worst. Chef Ramsey would have been smacking some mint across a bartenders face talking about how a good restaurant is all about consistency.

The warm bread basket was wonderful - the sweet rye bread was fantastic.  We enjoyed lettuce wraps and avocado spring rolls. Both were delicious. I especially loved the lettuce wraps.  I am a big fan of P.F. Changs' lettuce wraps, but I have to say, Cheesecake Factory certainly gave P.F. Changs serious competition. After the appetizers we split a piece of key lime cheesecake - certainly one cannot visit the Cheesecake Factory and not have cheesecake, right? The tart lime was a perfect complement to the meal. The one thing that did surprise me was the noise level in the restaurant. The ambiance would seem to suggest a quiet and relaxing atmosphere, but, in fact, the noise level was quite distracting. I am not sure if it was the acoustics of the room we were in or if it is just that noisy.

They do a great job here--the location is huge (2 stories, is that common? Haven't been to any other locations) and the set up is so elaborate I have no idea how the waiters and hosts know their way around the food delivery, table finding, and ticket administration procedures. You need a sherpa to go to the bathroom. I can't tell you much about decor, because it is kind of crazy and dark and shiny inside and always busy walking through to your table, but once you are sat, you can chat with your companions pretty easily and hear each other. All I remember for my party of 5 was a big soft leather crescent shaped booth and lots of mirrors behind everyone's heads. I disagree with the ""overpriced Chilis"" comparison. Yes it has basics like hamburgers for the picky people, but their menu is pretty diverse, too, and they do a good job having something available for everyone without being overly generic. If you want a burger, who cares! Get one for god's sake! It's your life, go for it! But you can also get beets with goat cheese, Vietnamese tacos, Ahi tartare, Lemon Ricotta pancakes (die! esp with bacon), a Navajo sandwich (with fry bread!), sweet corn tamale cakes...you could eat here every day and not try everything that piques your interest. My favorite part is that it is priced reasonably, but tries new things all the times. It's accessible! I think if you are coming here for a ""dining experience"" [snob voice] and are a person who sniffs the wine cork, you will be disappointed. But coming in for a shot of port and dessert, why not!  Yes, it's a chain, but a damn good one! I am happy to drop a $20 here. More like $30 for myself by the time I am done eating, but it is one of those places that has both awesome desserts (and not just cheesecake) and the food is great too! Huge plates, though, so probably share. OR just get dessert and commit to a whole slice. I have never had anything I wouldn't order again! This is where I eat when I am at the Galleria, for sure, but even if I am not at the Galleria, I would make a special trip to the Westheimer location just to get a good desert fix.

It's 3 huge thin pieces of chicken Milanese with a lemon butter sauce, some grated lemon peel, garlic mashed potatoes, and about 6 pieces of asparagus. I always take about half of it home because it's definitely a huge portion.  I drank apple cider, love it! It's definitely cider and not just apple juice. Service was pretty good, you'd expect ordinary service at chain restaurants that are packed, but our server was very attentive.  The place tends to be a little loud, since tables are practically crammed together unless you are seating at a booth. I found the music to be unnecessary.  I would really have to say that is one of my favorite restaurants. The menu is HUGE. Their smoothies are delicious, the bread they bring to you before your food is to die for, along with the butter.

485,Andrew E.,"Houston, TX",99,353,50.0,3.0,2013-06-27,"What's not to like about the Cheesecake Factory? Well okay, maybe their prices, but 7 bucks for a slice of cheese cake is pretty middle of the road when it comes to buying dessert at a chain restaurant. This has its pros and cons - the prices are average, but so is the dessert.  While they are a step above what you might get at Restaurant X, Y, Z, they really are just a cookbook dessert.  This makes me sadder when I know I can buy a whole cheesecake, not just a slice, at Costco for 14 bucks.  Ok that was an unfair comparison. The Costco's cheesecake selection is nowhere near as expansive as the Cheesecake Factory's but the quality is on par in my opinion. I guess in short, the cheesecake tastes good, but it is no way mindblowing. This is just a good place to grab a bite to eat with friends and enjoy some decent desert. But like any chain restaurant, it lacks the 'must have' ring to it. Service is meh - I saw one of the guys drop a to-go order, look around and pick it up. Sadly that was my fiancee's to-go order. Maybe that's why I'm unimpressed. For how much you pay, you should at least get quality. Throwing away that slice and giving customers quality is far more important than saving the $1 that slice is really worth and pissing them off later.

Wahoo for National Cheesecake day!  I was a bit eager, and jumped on their promo for half off a slice of cheesecake a day before the actual day.  Arrived, put name down and was surprisingly seated with no less than a 10 minute wait.  I could be wrong as I was distracted by the case of cheesecakes, trying to decide which one to get really made time fly.  Seated, promptly brought out a basket of bread and butter and I obligingly ate even though I was only here for dessert.  We had brown bread and white bread, I didn't care for the white one as I think it was Sourdough but I liked the slight sweetness of the brown one (Rye with flakes of Oatmeal?).  Anyways the brown bread was good and went well with the butter.  I think it is just your generic butter but the combination was addictive to me, I love bread and butter, especially since this one was warm!  However, I devoured this one while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive and when the second basket came, it was cold =(, I don't like cold bread. I wasn't super upset as our cheesecake and guests arrived shortly after and food always makes me happy.  We really wanted the tiramisu cake, but promo didn't work for cakes so bf and I split the tiramisu cheesecake.  The cheesecake version is denser and I think I prefer the traditional fluffy, light, creamy mousse, but the flavor profile overall was good.  I liked how I could taste the mocha flavor and it wasn't overly sweet and the whip cream was good.  Sadly our dining experience ended on a sour note as the service we received from our waitress was subpar.  I understood she was busy but she didn't seem so pleasant.  When I asked for another set of silverware and more bread for our guests she sounded reluctant to get it.  We also ended up waiting over 10 minutes to pay and had to have another waiter handle our bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=260,3.44,3.43,3.43,2.7,3.434

So, let's do this: lemme get excited about The Cheesecake Factory. First, I do love going to The Galleria for anything. So, next time, I won't be so cheap and deny myself valet service. I decided to park underground and hoof it up a flight of stairs, then another inside the mall ( yup, the escalators were out of service. of course the day I wear high heels. all in the name of sexy heels). Ok, so here's the skinny on the fat-laden Cheesecake factory: Pros: 1. In the mood for something off the menu? Don't hesitate to ask. My BFF was dying for some particular ""brunch-only"" grilled skirt steak and our server pulled some strings to get her exactly what she wanted despite us not being there during brunch. So thank you cool server for hooking us up! 2. The white and dark brown oat bread is warm and delicious with butter. OMG what I won't do for a warm bread basket.  3. Ask for a mango juice spritzer: half of their mango juice with seltzer. You'll thank me later, in case you end up diving in for a bite or three of cheesecake. 4. If you go during lunch, order from their lunch menu. Smaller portions with 2 sides and a smaller price ($11.99). I got the meatloaf with broccoli and sweet potato fries. 2 slices of tasty loaf, with  a little on the mushy side broccoli and perfectly salty sweet SP fries.   Cons: 1. If you sit on the patio upstairs, be sure to bring your sunglasses. You swear you were on the Love Boat 's Lido Desk. It gets super bright. Note: Vampires, sit inside.  2. Bathroom is downstairs only. Ladies, if wearing  heels, be prepared to take the elevator or walk down 1 flight of stairs.  3. Nothing truly exceptional here. The service is hit or miss: you won't get extremely friendly service or any special recommendations.  4. In my opinion, the cheesecakes here look impressive, but I'm more of a fan of smaller portions and lighter tasting cheesecakes. So for that reason, I can only warrant 3 stars.  All in all, if you're dining with someone who loves The Cheesecake Factory or a group with diverse tastes, their menu is perfect.

460,Stephen R.,"Houston, TX",95,95,638.0,2.0,2013-09-28,"Grandiose (adjective): characterized by affectation of grandeur or splendor or by absurd exaggeration. That would be a good starting description for The Cheesecake Factory. This particular location is large, two floors, and always crowded. The inside architecture/design reminds me of the ridiculous dining rooms on Carnival Cruise ships. All around over the top. To go along with the over the top interior design, the menus are filled with a crazy variety of foods.  The Food: First, there is a lot of variety (from pizza, to tacos, to steaks, to pastas, to everything else). Second, the food is probably more costly than it should be. Paying almost 20 dollars for chicken/cheese pasta is a little on the expensive side. The price may be proportional to the portion size, which is very large. I think it would be better if they made the portion smaller, and lowered the price to match the size. Beyond the pasta, I've had their pizza, burgers, steaks, pork chops, and chicken. Whoa, I've been to The Cheesecake Factory too many times. The food has not been terrible, it just has not been memorable. And the Cheesecake: The Cheesecake Factory wins the prize for having the worst tasting cheesecake flavor/combination I've ever had.... Key Lime Pie Cheesecake. It was bad, but maybe it was my fault for ordering something like Key Lime Pie Cheesecake. Go ahead, say ""Key Lime Pie Cheesecake"" out loud. Sounds terrible doesn't it? Ignoring the above, the other cheesecakes I've tried were not bad. Strawberry, Oreo, Snickers, Raspberry, Cherry, etc. They are 7-8 dollars, large, and easily shareable between two people. The Cheesecake Factory must be doing something right though. They are always packed. I can't say that I've ever had bad service. Sometimes slow service, but I can see why given the volume of people in the restaurant(s) when I've been there. I've been many times, though I must say that it's never been my idea to go! The Cheesecake Factory tries to do too much and fails at having anything memorable. It is definitely average... but average should not cost this much.

The portion is smaller compare to other dishes. Steak is tender and juicy. Chicken is flavorful because of the cheese topping. Kid's meals are big for our 5 year olds. Pumpkin and pecan cheese cake is very delicious.  It is somewhat overrated at this place because all the tourists and out of towners.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=360,3.24,3.42,3.42,2.7640000000000002,3.3480000000000008

It's open late, and the location is convenient, those must surely be the only reasons why it's so packed. The dishes here are mediocre calorie bombs. The cheesecake is good, but I've had better.  Service was particularly terrible on our most recent visit. My burger was cold, my friend's chicken was lukewarm, and my husband's appetizer was so hot, I almost burned my fingers when I reached for a portion of it. My friend asked for lemon for her water and more bread, and we received neither. My fries weren't delivered until much later, and the server dashed off so fast, I couldn't even ask for ketchup. Seriously, who eats fries without condiments? Drinks were never refilled, I ended up giving my friend half of my glass of water. At the end of our meal, we asked for our checks, and the server just tossed them on the table. Not even a ""thank you for dining with us"", or ""have a good night"".

109,Amy H.,"Houston, TX",1,31,6.0,2.0,2013-12-10,"Had a gift card so we went to the Cheesecake Factory for a weeknight date night (and to avoid cooking).  I've been to Cheesecake several times and know the drill: huge menu, even bigger portions, decadent dishes, and a nice slice of cheesecake to finish the meal. Well,  I'm not sure if my expectations have risen since my previous visits (which isn't so bad) or if this visit was especially bad, but I was left unimpressed and underwhelmed.  The food was not up to par with past experiences- I always order the same creamy pasta dish, and if I'm going to waste my day's calories on it, it better be luscious.  Here it was bland, lacking sauce and flavor.  I almost wanted to ask for a cup of sauce on the side, but shouldn't the pasta be edible when served?  The cheesecake was unfortunately not great either; creamy and rich, but lacking strong flavor. The icing on the (cheese)cake?  Horrible, absolutely terrible service.  I tend to over-tip and only consider a few things to be deal breakers, but our waiter hit every one of them.  First, only refilled my water once.  When the cup is 3/4 ice, I appreciate being checked on so my glass isn't empty- we were barely checked on, and I had to flag down random servers for water.  Second, completely inattentive; only asked us how everything was as he was dropping off the food- obviously I don't know how it is, I haven't touched my plate yet!  The worst, though, a random server brought the check with the plated cheesecake.  What?!  The worst thing you can do for service is bring the check before the patrons are finished eating.  In other cultures, you have to specifically request the check (instead of it being brought over) for that reason.  There goes your tip, and I won't consider the Cheesecake Factory for future dining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=320,3.12,3.44,3.44,2.536,3.3120000000000007

The helping of chicken was HUGE and, even while that was enough, they decided to also have a whole helping of spaghetti. My friend let me have some of each and I was definitely not disappointed by any means. The chicken was lightly breaded, but crispy, not greasy, and very flavorful. As for me, I got the Pan-Seared Mahi Mahi and Shrimp Veracruz with asparagus. Obviously, I was in a seafood mood. While the Mahi could have used a TAD bit more seasoning, the shrimp was some of the best I've had- very plump and juicy, a nice char, and it was freaking delicious!

It's in the Galleria - so parking is always a hassle.   There is almost always a wait, even on either end of peak times.  You could probably go at 2pm on a weekday and be ok.  But a Friday or Saturday night?  There's gonna be a wait. The hostesses have always been friendly.  However, I do have a SERIOUS problem with their tabling system.  As I noted earlier, this place is always packed.  When you check in, you're given a pager and told your wait time.  Unfortunately most other guests just pile up right there by the hostess stand.  When your table is ready, they buzz you, take your pager and point about 10 feet away and tell you to stand there and wait.  Again.  The place they pointed?  Right where everyone is hanging out OR trying to walk through.  It's a high traffic area for guests coming up the stairs below, waiters carrying food to tables, the check out place for people having just cheesecake, the folks just standing there because they have nowhere else to go AND the people just directed there by the hostess.   I just don't understand why it's done that way.  Buzz me via the pager, and hand me off immediately to a waiter or someone to seat me.  Please don't make me go dance around the dozens of other folks in that tiny little area. With that said, our waiter was fantastic.  Brandon seemed to be having a good time, and he was worth a large tip.   The food was also pretty damn good.  You're not going to get super fancy food that you'll never see again, but you will get a pretty excellent meal.  Between the drinks (Long Island is a beast), the appetizers (Buffalo Blasts, seriously) and the food (Chicken Romano!) - I was stuffed, fat and happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=200,2.88,3.38,3.38,2.732,3.18

464,Kathryn H.,"Houston, TX",80,82,9.0,2.0,2014-05-13,"I know a lot of people cultishly love this place.  Co-workers rave about it and light up when they get to go for their birthday.  These are the same co-workers that prefer Miller Lite over a special crafted pilsner.   I went years ago, and just never went back.  We had a party of five, and it was during the busiest time possible (much to my chagrin).  I don't know why my friends at the time insisted on going when you couldn't fit your pinky toe into the building because of the crowds.   Needless today, that pretty much put my experience way down low - and it's really not their fault for the bad timing of my friends.    I might have thought better of it if I went when it wasn't swarming with people.  Personally, I prefer the smooth and creamy type of cheesecake - I'm not a fan of the curdled cheesecakes that have this weird, pilly texture.  I recognize that it's a personal preference over actual quality.  Everyone else loved theirs - I just don't like my cheesecake to have that consistency.   The food was so overly salted, the vegetables were mushy and overcooked, and the chicken I had was definitely pre-prepared.   The portion was almost four meals for myself - and I ended up throwing most of it away.   I have heard that they've introduced a diet, small plate, or skinny menu, but I just wasn't impressed enough to go back on my own. If my friends invite me, I might give them another go - I just didn't see what all the hype was about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=260,2.92,3.36,3.36,2.568,3.184

First off, it's located in the Galleria shopping center. And it's 2 stories! But it's location means this restaurant gets pretty crowded in the evenings. When I went, we had to wait for about 15 minutes and there wasn't a good waiting area. It sure was fancy inside though! As for the meal itself... I always eat too much of the yummy wheat bread appetizer and I think we asked for about 2 or 3 refills (the waitress might have been annoyed). My friend ordered some kind of Mexican salad with chicken and cheese and peanut dressing which was huge; she said it was really good and didn't even finish the entire portion. I ordered a salad with salmon which was pretty average. The salmon was slightly dry. Definitely not worth the $15 I paid. We didn't end up getting cheesecake but I've had it before and it's really good - super rich and creamy! One slice is wayyyyy more than enough for one person. I'd say 2-3 people can share so at $7 a slice, it's a good deal! All the flavors I've tried I've liked but my favorite flavor is the red velvet.

As to be expected the restaurant was busy but we were willing to wait the short 15 minute wait. After being seated we only waited a few minutes before our waiter came over to greet us and take our drink order. I don't expect servers to be over the top friendly but this guy clearly did not want to wait on us. The water he brought my boyfriend had a piece of cheesecake in it! EW EW EWWWWWW! We had asked another server to replace the water for us, but he never bothered to ask if we were okay or apologized. We had completely lost our appetite and didn't bother eating our entree. Not to mention our entrees were not appetizing looking at all. My boyfriend and I both ordered salads and they looked as if they were sitting in the window for hours. The lettuce was browning and drowning in dressing. Our waiter was barley present at our table and checked on us only one time. I wanted to order cheesecake and my boyfriend was asking for a menu but I was so discouraged from the evenings service and food that I told our waiter to just bring the check, which he actually shrugged at us at the table at went off for the check. WHAT KIND OF RESTAURANT NAMED AFTER CHEESECAKE DOESNT OFFER YOUR CUSTOMERS CHEESECAKE?? ON NATIONAL CHEESECAKE DAY?!! So he closed us out (tab was $62) and I tipped accordingly (18% even though he REALLY RELALY did not deserve it).  But it doesn't end there.... So I really really wanted cheesecake so I decided the night can be saved. I will stop by the cheesecake service area and order a cheesecake to go. I used a gift card to pay for dinner and apparently our waiter hadn't closed out the table so we had to wait for the cashier to call him over to close the tab so we could pay for our cheesecake. This guy had the nerve to come over and ask me if I had taken the check book. Um maybe if you were present at the table more often you would have known where it was. I left without the cheesecake. I won't be returning. For the price you can have a much much better dinner elsewhere.

Just kidding, but I legitimately do like Cheesecake Factory. The food is good, definitely not healthy, and comes in gargantuan proportions. Think like 3 meals per dish. My date and I both ordered pasta dishes and when they brought them to our table they looked more like serving bowls for an entire table. Sheesh. But I suppose that makes it more worth the money. I ate pasta for lunch for the next 2 days.  Then we shared 2 pieces of cheesecake - a peanut butter chocolate variety and a mango key lime. Both were amazingly delicious. And we had leftovers of that too! I really like the brown bread they serve as well. Slightly sweet and so yummy.  The service is always great at The Cheesecake Factory. And the ambiance is fast-paced in an exciting way. It's probably all in my head, but I just feel like I'm doing something special when I eat at this Cheesecake Factory.

With that aside, our server was wonderful.  He was very attentive, but never intrusive.  I ordered a grilled salmon which was very good.  He didn't charge me for my extra side of asparagus -- which winded up being a good thing because they were semi-overdone anyway.  After about 15 minutes of dining, there was a server change of shift and I was afraid that the continuity of service would be lacking, but our next server was just as great. Our booth was located next to where all the other servers congregate and they were very unprofessional speaking loudly and cursing -- typical teenage behavior.  I was already feeling miserable sweating to death, so being forced to listen to them was just icing on the cake. Would I come back?  Yes, just because I love the food.  Maybe my next experience would be better.  There is a veranda adjacent to the restaurant so I'll just sit outside when it's hot next time.   - Disgusting, smelly women's bathroom.  My  particular stall had scattered toilet paper and small spots of blood on the floor... yuck.  My bf said it wasn't much better on the men's side either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=100,2.52,3.02,3.02,3.1160000000000005,2.8200000000000003

333,Vanessa B.,"Houston, TX",73,238,89.0,5.0,2015-01-16,"I have eaten here a few times, but mostly we get it to go. They give you an estimated time it will be ready, and it's always been ready when I've arrived. The waiting area for dining can be crowded, but the to go counter never has more than one or two people in it, and mostly there's never a line. They pull everything out of the to go bags and go over your order with you to ensure you get what you wanted. They will throw in some of their fresh baked bread and butter at no charge. I recommend the wheat bread, I normally don't prefer wheat bread but theirs is a little sweet, and it's always warm.  The regular portions are huge, and the lunch portions are also huge, but smaller than the normal portion.  The Chinese chicken salad is good, as is the Santa Fe chicken salad. The Santa Fe's dressing is simply amazing, it is described as Spicy Peanut-Cilantro Vinaigrette, but it is not spicy at all. I always ask for extra dressing. They are stingy on the tortilla strips but you can ask for extras also. The chicken is thinly sliced and everything blends together nicely.  I've also had their lunch pizza & salad, the pizza has a fairly thin crust, and the cheese always tastes great. The lunch shepherd's pie is also very good, and a very nice sized portion.  My only complaint is the traffic around the galleria and the parking. I normally park on the roof deck and pay the minimum charge, even though I'm in and out in less than 15 minutes (this used to be free, but of course now they make you pay!) There is a valet (I think free?), but I've valeted before and told the guy I had to go to one store close by and would be back in less than 20 minutes, but they still went and parked my car & then I had to wait for them to bring it back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=140,3.28,3.07,3.07,3.124,3.154

331,Brandon W.,"Phoenix, AZ",127,12,6.0,4.0,2015-02-03,"Let me start by saying Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants.  I've eaten here soooo many times, and I've never gotten tired of it.  The building itself is inside the mall, so you can park at any of the garages and walk to it.  It has an entrance on the 2nd floor, and another entrance on the 1st floor (which is where the bar is).  Since it IS in the galleria, good luck finding parking on the weekends. This place gets pretty packed around lunch and dinner time so you will have to wait, especially if you have large parties.  The waiting area can get pretty crowded too, so go at off hours if you want to avoid the chaos. If you're new to this place, you'll be surprised at the sheer number of items on the menu.  On top of that, they will give you complementary bread & butter.  As far as  the appetizers here, its all pretty good.  Except for a few things, such as the ""vietnamese shrimp summer rolls.""  That stuff's pretty cold and bland. Don't know what to choose for lunch or dinner?  The pasta & burger/sandwiches are always a good choice, not to mention the size of the portions (they are VERY big).  If you come during lunch time, you can get a ""lunch special"" of certain items, such as the pasta.  It's a smaller size portion, but to be honest it's still quite a lot of food.  Overall, most of the things on the menu here are good.   As far as the cheesecake goes, the Cheesecake Factory has THE BEST cheesecake.  Again, you can't go wrong with any of this stuff.  It's all good.  BUT, be warned, one slice has like 750-1000 calories. Wait, but Brandon, what do you recommend? Well check it out homie: 1. Appetizers: Crabcakes, Factory Nachos, Crab & Artichoke Dip, Crispy Crab Bites 2. Salads:  I don't eat salads here 3. Real Food: Kobe Burger (personal favorite, get it with sweet potato fries and ask for chipotle mayo), Southwest Chicken Sandwich, Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta, Shepherd's Pie, Famous Factory Meatloaf 4. Cheesecake: Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake (a classic), White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut, Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake Oh, and don't get the vietnamese shrimp summer rolls.  Or the fish tacos.  Just sayin",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=140,3.28,3.07,3.07,2.8000000000000003,3.154
3,Brie H.,"Leander, TX",21,30,,2.0,2015-02-08,"Went here with my husband for my birthday dinner, we aren't  from the area but know we like cheesecake factory. We arrived around 6:30 on a Saturday night. First off, it was an absolute mad house. They had us go upstairs to wait, and there were people everywhere standing around waiting- all the way out into the hallway which connects to the mall. The hostess told us it would be 15 minutes so we decided to wait. We waited about 20 minutes, and then were seated at a teeny  2 top table, sandwiched  between two other tables, all sharing a long booth bench seat. It was a little awkward so we asked to switch to another more secluded seat that was also empty.  We switched seats and waited about 5 minutes before the waitress came to get our drink order. She was alright, not very friendly or personable though. I ordered the Thai lettuce wraps and my hubby got Baja fish tacos after about 10 more minutes of waiting for her to take our order. The waitress came back a few seconds  later and told me they were ""out"" of the lettuce wraps. I looked for another few minutes for a second choice, and ordered a cashew chicken salad. We finally received our food, and the salad portion was enormous, and it was very tasty. My husband also enjoyed the fish tacos. The waitress disappeared again for awhile and when she finally came back I  asked to get  the ""warm apple crisp"" to go. She said it comes with ice cream on top so she didn't  think  that would  work because it would melt...we asked if she could put the ice cream in a separate container, and she said okay.  As we are waiting for our dessert, I look over at a table that was seated awhile after us, and the lady is eating thai lettuce wraps! The same lettuce wraps I was told they were ""out of"". Pretty annoying. Anyway, at this point I am just ready to get back to our hotel and enjoy the apple crisp. We get the to-go bag and head out...we get tho the hotel and I open up the box...and the ""warm"" apple crisp is completely cold. And not like it just cooled down the way from the restaurant...cold like it had simply been taken out of the fridge and tossed in a box. Very disappointing, and didn't  taste great. I was very disappointed with this dining experience, especially since it was my birthday.

He stated that the bread would be out shortly. Well ""shortly"" turned into 30 minutes! When we asked him about it, he stated that all the servers were in line to get bread and he wasn't able to get any. WTF! I found that hard to believe bc all of the servers around our table brought bread to their customers! So we didn't get any until we received our entrees. Next, I ordered a cheeseburger with onion rings and a peach Bellini. I guess ordering that was to much to ask bc I NEVER received my Bellini and when my food came out, it didn't include the onion rings. And to top it off, the burger came on a sourdough roll instead of a bun! The top of the bun was so crispy and burnt, there was no way I could eat it. I asked for a manager, however I did not want anything else from this establishment. I told them to take it all away.

407,Alexandra F.,"Houston, TX",10,2,2.0,1.0,2015-07-05,"WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED IN ANY ESTABLISHMENT!!! I was there for the 4th of July to have an early dinner with my family. My mother had showed up 10 minutes early and got us a table. From the minute my mother sat down and the rest of us showed up it had been a total of 25 minutes if not a bit more WITHOUT anyone acknowledging our table! I decided to get up  and find the manager. I flagged him down and let him know how long it had been. He followed me over to the table and David (the manager) offered to take our drink order. My mother said it would be best to order everything now since we didn't want to wait any longer. David quickly said that he would JUST put in our drink orders and that the server should be over to take our food order. Wow really David?     Okay so after waiting five more increasingly annoying minutes, the server comes over to the table with like six bread baskets stacked up on top of each other and resting on his dirty work shirt. He picks out two baskets and drops them on the table. He happily apologizes for the wait and goes on to say, ""Sorry y'all there are other tables before y'all so I'm taking care of them first so y'all just have to wait."" AWESOME!! So of course he left again. David comes over and drops off our drinks and leaves. He didn't ask how anything was going or if we have been helped yet. Nothing. He just quickly left completely avoiding the situation. So the server comes back and FINALLY takes our order after being gone 5 more minutes since his last friendly visit. He takes the order and leaves. I am extremely enraged at this point in time. Food comes out in a ""timely"" manner. My cousin had ordered his burger well done and it came out damn near rare. Awesome.    I just want it to be known that I don't like the server we had. He is completely unprofessional and he kept talking to us like we were his buddies. His mannerisms are absolutely terrible, he kept playing with his nose while talking to us and he was arrogant. Any who the server comes over to check on us and he crouched down near my mother and asks her how's her food then proceeds to ask her if she's ""getting her money's worth""..... WOW!!! Who hired this clown?? Unbelievable. And yet again I see David pass up our table without a word. So weak. I ask for some boxes and the check. He comes back with the boxes and later he drops the check and of course we expect nothing would be comp'd off especially with the overwhelming warm experience we have had. Which nothing was. It's not about the money. We come here to spend money. It's about showing you care and you're sorry for the horrendous experience we've had and you hope we come back.

They have every style of cuisine and anyone on any budget can find something to eat that they will enjoy. Let me forewarn you though, the portion sizes are huge! I order a small Caesar salad and can literally share it with two other people as a starter. I highly recommend that you eat family style here so you can get the most out of the restaurant.   They have over 250 menu items and any kind of cheese cake you can imagine. It's hit or miss when it comes to service but the food quality keeps you coming back for more.

396,Paulette M.,"Humble, TX",20,10,2.0,1.0,2015-12-11,"Today I brought my group of seniors to eat here.  This was our main reason for visiting the Galleria. I had heard the food was the best, the price was the best and the service was better than best.  Here are the facts: We arrived at The Cheesecake Factory and were seated at 11:05 AM.  We met our sweet and very cordial waitress.  She got us our drinks, mostly water. Then we gave our orders for our meals.  We were a group of nine elderly persons.  We told the waitress how we looked forward to this treat of eating at this nice restaurant.  She brought us bread and butter and more bread and butter and this was delicious .  When we first arrived at the restaurant and at our table, we were the only customers in this area.  By the time we got our bread, more people were sitting around us.  Around Noon most of the people around us were already eating their meals.  We were still being served bread.  Though the bread was delicious,we really wondered where our meals were.  We spoke to the manager and told him we needed to be on a bus at 1:00 PM and asked where were our meals.  He said they will be here soon.    At 12:30 (Now remember we did have to be on the bus by 1:00 PM)we were still waiting for our food.  We saw our waitress running quickly with food for every other table.  We finally told the manager and our waitress to be sure to bring some take home containers and bags because it seemed like we weren't going to have time to eat there.  They said all would  be okay.  and finally at 12:35 some meals started arriving at our tables.  Some were quickly removed because they were someone else's order.  We did get our meals and had about 10 minutes to eat what we had ordered.  Most of us put the meal in our carry out bag. We had been in that restaurant sitting down for an hour and a half before we were served a meal.  My meal was eaten as a take home for supper, a very expensive ""TV microwave meal."" And I didn't even have time to buy a slice of cheese cake. This was the first time any of us had eaten here before and I am sure it will be the last time because I do believe that the manager should have given us these meals on the house... I hate to say it but I believe if we had been a group of young business men we would have gotten our meals comp or we would have walked out.  Going to the Cheesefactory today was a trip planned to be so much fun for many seniors who looked forward to this for over a month and what a let down it was, thanks the manager who didn't even acknowledge his responsibility to his customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=200,2.2,2.78,3.088,2.052,2.548

369,Kate J.,"Beaumont, TX",0,8,,2.0,2015-12-29,"This particular restaurant has been an old favorite of mine whenever I am in town. However, my experience today was the absolute worst to date. We had a party of 8 people- four kids, and four adults. Most of our group was eating here for the very first time; therefore, looking forward to the whole experience. At first things were fine. The waiter seemed attentive and our appetizers were delivered promptly. This is where everything went to sh*t. The kids' meals came out one at a time, and staggered. My daughter's cheese quesadilla was not delivered with the others though, and if you have a group of kiddos, this was upsetting and frustrating for her and me as a parent. Then we waited. And waited. And waited some more. No quesadilla yet! No nothing.  I caught a manager's attention and asked what was up with the food, also noticing that our waiter had basically disappeared. While the mngr was standing at the table, the waiter appeared with 2/4 of the adult entrees. The waiter immediately had attitude, and I could see it on his face. He basically threw the plates down and huffed off. Still no quesadilla either. Then we waited some more for the rest of our food. By this point we are all irritated and not enjoying this experience at all. (By the way, if you order the ""Tortilla Soup"" expect to get slop). The last thing that happened involved the huffy waiter when I asked- yet again- where my daughter's quesadilla was. He said, ""don't you get attitude with me, lady! It is not my fault!""  I was so embarrassed and mortified that I lost my appetite completely! When he finally brought it out, it was dripping with grease and looked a mess! All in all, a really depressing experience.

I absolutely adore that they have a skinny menu, and their chopped salad is plentiful and delicious and for less than 600 calories. I seriously do not see how you can go wrong. The price is a bit steep for a salad, but I seriously crave this one and their dressing. And since we're being good, we can splurge on a slice (or 3) of the pumpernickel bread. Onto the service, the last time I came I was out to lunch with my team, and we were in a rush. My supervisor ordered the salmon, my co-worker a pasta dish, and I of course ordered my salad. When the pasta and salad came out, the waiter told us that the salmon was not placed due to a mistake in the back, but he apologized profusely and offered to bring her a soup to keep her waiting. She agreed and took the tortilla soup, and after this, the manager stopped by to also apologize and make sure she got something to eat while she was waiting. She enjoyed the tortilla soup, and the salmon came not too long after, and the waiter knew we were in a rush so he brought us all to-go containers and bags ahead of time. Every restaurant has mistakes happen, and Cheesecake Factory demonstrated EXACTLY how every restaurant should handle every mistake and delay in service to keep customers happy and coming back.

I settled with the Lousiana chicken pasta to go but I was so upset because I was looking forward to that dish. My boyfriend refused to eat in front me so his food ended getting cold.

The food is overall good, it's usually a lively scene and service is good.  I first stumble across the CF when I was a 10 years old. I remember what I ordered, too. I had the Thai lettuce wraps for an app and the Jamaican black shrimp for an entree. (Yes, I was fancy). And now that I am 21*** I still love this place and frequent with family and friends. My favorite apps are the avocado rolls, the aforementioned Thai lettuce wraps, and I use to enjoy the pot stickers-when it was on the menu. My favorite entrees are the Jamaican black shrimp, any of the pasta dishes, and the baked salmon. My favorite dessert is the always dependable strawberry cheesecake and the sweet and velvety red velvet cheesecake. mmm, boy! Now, I'm keeping my review at 5 stars but, I have to admit, I've had some bad meals here and there. But this is not high class fine dining, and I've had many more good meal experiences than bad.

She said her manager told her to ""still bring the plate of the food and see if it can entice her to take it home"" really?.  I would reserve going to Cheesecake Factory on pay week by myself and only order appetizers.  It's expensive and I hate spending hard earned money somewhere that the service just isn't up to par.  I enjoyed my meal but did not enjoy the interactions in between or the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=120,2.72,2.63,2.992,2.504,2.6660000000000004

My friend and I decided to meet up here for dinner in Houston.  It was during the work week and I arrived at 7pm.  The restaurant was about 1/3 full.  Upon arriving the pleasant male host seated me in a nice booth and got my server.  I ordered the complimentary bread with lots of butter.   My friend arrived by 7:15 which at that time she also asked for pumpernickel or the brown bread.  We ordered our drinks and my fave fried avocado egg rolls as an app with an unique Asian flavored dipping sauce 4.5 star. We asked several times to 3 people at least about our bread.  It finally arrived 1 hour later at 8pm, after I first ordered it from our server.  Freakin 1 hour!!!  Is there a bread shortage in this restaurant or did our server want a smaller tip?? We wanted to sit, talk and catch up but it would of been nice to have some food!   I ordered my fave Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp with white rice.  It's like an Asian fusion entree complimented with coconut, crumbled peanuts, green onions and an Asian peanut sauce...5 stars! My friend ordered the American hamburger and fries and would order it again so I guess 4 stars for that entree.   I got a slice of the Reese's Peanut Butter Cheesecake to go also...4.5 star.   They had 2 large cases of cheesecakes of all different kinds from basic to very unique.  They also had about 3 10"" tall cakes if you wanted a large slice of cake. The menu is still large with so many apps and entrees to please just about everyone.  If you need to charge your phone there is no plug available in the bar area.  There was one available on our floor in another area but you would need at least a 4 ft extension cord.  Just FYI.   We had to wait to pay also.  It started getting real annoying because it was going on 3 hours.  Whenever I go to a Cheesecake Factory the food has always been real good but the servers are almost always slow or disorganized.

By this time we're like WTF? So finally he comes back says ""Do you want to order?"" I'm like (facepalm) Now I cannot eat rare hamburger because when I was growing up my mother nibbled at the raw hamburger while cooking and as a result, got a tapeworm which completely turned me off raw hamburger for the rest of my life. And something I've struggled with for decades is places that try to cook hamburgers like steak - they always always always fail to get the desired result because hamburger Is Not Steak. (unless it's a high-end restaurant and their hamburgers are inch-and-a-half thick ground sirloin). (and is anyone as old as me and remembers when Chili's only served hamburgers and would **only** cook them medium-rare?) So I say I want it cooked until no longer pink but... and he cuts me off and goes ""well done"". And I go (facepalm). We go round and round with me trying to cancel the burger 4 or 5 times and him ignoring my requests and finally going off to find the cook for me to talk to. It's not the cook that shows up but a manager who asked what the problem was. I tell her I want the burger cooked until no longer pink but still juicy and she goes ""well done"" and I go (facepalm). I ask her to cancel the hamburger which she actually does. BF's burger comes, he ordered it medium-rare, no bun, it comes medium with a bun, no condiments. I testily snap ""Do Not Send It Back."" He cuts it in half, shares it with me. Waiter shows back up, puts the check on our table we're like WTF? Picks the check up after BF snarls at him. I had gotten no sleep the night before so I was extremely fragile and snarky as well. Exceedingly snarky. Waiter comes back, clears the table. I would have gone (facepalm) but I had part of a hamburger in my hand and no dishes on the table. We speculate  the reason he's showing up more often at our table is probably cause the other 2 tables have left. The only good thing about this is we didn't pay for anything because of the gift card. Next time I'll tell BF ""fuck the gift card and take me to Pub Fountains"". Afterthought edit: They handled the stupid hamburger issue all wrong. Instead of arguing with me over it, the waiter should have just cancelled it first time I asked, brought me the menu and offered the suggestion ""see if there's anything else here you'd rather have.""  And I probably would have.

352,Sandy C.,"Houston, TX",23,29,10.0,1.0,2016-07-20,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory in the Galleria, first the floors were greasy. I had some rubber in the bottom of my shoes, yet it was still slippery and slimy. It just did not feel like the same Cheesecake factory from 3 years ago. Then, I asked for a booth and they took me to a table, I said, as I passed by an empty booth can I sit here? He went back to ask the hostess, and she said sit them at the back booth, they will get their food faster. So, we sat at the booth in the back. Then our waiter was so unsettled, hyper, and looked like he was overstressed. He did not take the time to listen. I think he must have had like 12 tables at a time, not kidding. It took him forever to comeback and brought us water and would leave for 20 minutes or more. Finally, he took our order, but was super hyper. He left, and it took him 15 minutes to come back and tell us, they did not have what we wanted. Cool, we decided to order something different. While we kept waiting, we could see the kitchen and all the action. The lady at the food line in a red shirt and black pants was distributing the orders. She grabbed the plates with her hands, no gloves. And, would swipe a fry and put in her mouth and eat it. That was disgusting!! She did this more than once. The floors were so grease and dirty. No body were gloves in the kitchen. Then, finally our appetizer was out, and our food  5 minutes later almost all at the same time. And while we started to eat. Guess who was our guests at our table. A cockroach!!!!! Not the big size ones like the ones you see everywhere in Texas. No, the kind use see in dirty apartments, nomes, or food establishments.  We dropped our food and could not eat. We called the waiter and told him! Then, he leaned over my daughter, grabbed the roach with a napkin, and some of it dropped in my daughters food. And, we told him we can't eat, this is grease!! We need to speak to the Manager!! So, he said, OH MAN!!! Had a very bad attitude! Very unprofessional! He said, I am bringing your bill out! The nerve of him!! Then, the manager never came, but the bill did. I had to ask a bus boy from the back, since we were literally right next to the kitchen, to please get me the Manager. That took 3 minutes. Because the waiter we had did not want to bring him out. The Manager used all the excuses in the book. Well, this is the way it is everywhere in Houston, plus we can't help it if the other places around us, does not take care of it, sorry about that. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THAT PLACE!!!! GROASE!!!! GROASE!!!! VERY GROASE!!!!    STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!! THESE PEOPLE ARE RUDE!!! HAVE NO MANNERS!!! AND ARE REALLY DIRTY!!!! I will not be surprised if someone has not fallen from those dirty greasy floors, and I know the difference between shiny and greasy!!! I will not be surprised either if someone has had food poisoning there!!!

Just a hint: if you are going to order a main entree, plan on getting about three meals out of it.  Personally, I go for an appetizer, which is one or two meals.  My favorite is the fried macaroni and cheese.  You are served four breaded and fried balls of macaroni and cheese on a chunky marinara.  When you plunge your fork into the ball, you will find lots of white cheddar cheese and macaroni. I have tried so many things on this menu and I have NEVER been disappointed. I'm usually not all that experimental but Cheesecake Factory has gotten me out of my old habits! If you're a Veggie... they make some of the best salads I have ever had.  If I want a salad for a meal (which is rare) the first place I think of is Cheesecake, hands down.  My personal favorite is the Luau Salad.  I am also rather fond of the Chicken Tostada Salad.   This place makes some damn good cheesecake with about 20 available selections.  I guess that's what they are named for.  A fail-proof order is the fresh strawberry - it's a classic.  Dulce de Leche, though I feared might be too sweet, but divine - rich without being overpowering.  However, I almost feel that they got a little zealous with their combinations.  Some of those cheesecakes really never had to be made.  German chocolate cheesecake?  Boston cream cheesecake?   At the end of your enjoyable meal... they bring you the bill....  Although it isn't too bad, it's still pricey.  Normally, the wait is about 45 minutes.  If you get there early or on a weekday, you may be seated immediately.  This place is a must-try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=100,2.52,2.41,2.876,2.9600000000000004,2.454

Moreover, the Tomato Basil Pasta I had was pretty disappointing. It came with grilled chicken and mozzarella, but in very small pieces and quantity. Instead of pairing with the pasta, I felt that the chicken and mozzarella pieces were drowning in a sea of bland penne and diced tomatoes. Again, the portion size was absolutely massive (I barely ate half of the dish), but bigger is not better if the flavour isn't there.  Luckily, their strawberry cheesecake saved the day! It was creamy, rich, and as delicious as I imagined it would be. The strawberries and whipped cream on top complemented it really well and made for a decadent dessert.

It took another 15 minutes for our waitress to return so that my mother could select a different dish. 4. We ask for a manager - it took the manager, Chris, over 10 minutes to come to our table.  I remember the time because I intentionally checked because it took so long.  When we asked our waitress why it was taking so long, she said ""the managers are all having a meeting with the new shift.""  Umm..ok?  I have never heard of a manager at a restaurant being unavailable when a patron asks to speak with one. 5. Manager finally arrives and my mother places a new order.  We order our dessert (remember, it is her birthday and BOTH this manager, Chris AND our waitress knew). 6. Dessert arrives.  No candle.  No ""happy birthday"" on the plate.  No song.  We ask our waitress if they still sing to guests at the table, and she says, and I QUOTE ""Oh, we still sing, but we only do it for certain tables... sometimes we don't want to disturb other guests.. But I always do it for my guests..""  ... Umm.. awkward?  So we are not your guests?  Are we not deserving?  Also, this was about 4pm, and there were maybe 3 people seated in our section. 7. We call a manager over again.  Takes Chris the same 10-15 minutes to arrive.  He proceeds to tell us what he would NOT do (i.e. comp our horrible dinner).  We end up ARGUING with the manager about our horrible experience (because there are plenty more details, such as old coffee, tea, cold food, no water refills, OVER CHARGED for things my mother sent back, poor service all around).   I have NEVER been to a restaurant where a manager argues with a patron about the experience they had at their restaurant.  I will NEVER, EVER take ANYONE to The Cheesecake Factory again.  I will NEVER recommend going there.  Absolutely deplorable service, and an even more awful dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=60,3.12,2.77,2.836,2.02,2.91

My fiance and I came in and got seated right away, our waitress greeted us and took down our drink orders and went on her way. Sitting next to us were 2 women who seemed to be having a problem with what they had ordered and I'm guessing the manager or whatever was helping them out (the same lady who brought us to our seats, so maybe she was the host?) We got our drinks and my fiance had finished his and was given a refill by our waitress who just kind of plopped it on the table and left. 10 minutes go by and I'm sitting there hungry waiting for that magical complimentary bread and butter to show up and it doesn't, another 10 minutes go by and our waitress walks by us and doesn't even stop to let us know if our food is almost ready yet or not. So by this time the 2 ladies who were next to us had already left and a new group of people came in. (one of them didn't even finish their food because something was wrong so she ordered a dessert to go, it came on a plate and she had to tell them she was getting it to go... manager/host did a goof job there. *sarcastic* and yes I was eavesdropping cause there was no bread and butter to catch my attention) my fiance sees the lady who was dealing with the 2 ladies before and asks if we can get some bread and she says yes she'll get some. We see her walk to the place where they're cooking, thinking she or someone would bring us some but nope. So 20 minutes have gone by and no bread, another 5 minutes have gone by and we see the lady walking around and still no bread or news about our food. And my patience just drops waaaayy down and I see a guy at the desk area and I tell him that we've been sitting for over 20 minutes with no bread and we have no idea when our food will be out or where our waitress is and he says he'll get her right away. So I sit down, she's taking drink orders from the new group of people next to us and comes over and says ""what did you want?"" And i said ""oh, i just wanted some bread"" and she says she'll go get some. Like wtf....what about my food. So bread comes and a few minutes the food comes out too. I got the shrimp scampi and steak diane combo thingy and it comes with mash potatoes and it's $21.95 or something. PEOPLE IT IS NOT WORTH IT! i got 3 little pieces of meat mixed with shiitake mushrooms and onion, 3 shrimps (shouldn't the shrimp scampi have some sort of pasta at the very least?) And i got a whole not fully cooked potato in my mashed potatoes, my fork barely cut through. My food was cold but after all that waiting I was just happy there was some sort of food in front of me. I did ask our waitress to get me another side of mashed potatoes and I was like... if she charges me for this I will explode. But at least the burger my fiance got was good. I ordered a slice of chocolate cake to go cause i didn't want to be there any longer, and when i opened to eat it in the car it was this thin slice. In conclusion I'm never going here again.

It was embedded in the crust!!!! Soooooo disgusting right? Well after our waiter called a manager, he literally came to us, maybe 10 minutes later.... and stated ""I'm sorry do you want a another one or do you want it off the bill"" he was not empathetic at all!

I typically get the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, but I really wanted rice and chicken, so Cam and I opted to share the Cashew Chicken with Rice, which was awesome.

This restaurant spans across two floors, so I was a little confused when we walked in and there was no one in the restaurant. Turns out everyone was upstairs. The wait was a bit long, but they also seemed a bit understaffed in the front.

Cheesecake factory is almost the same everywhere with decoir and food consistency, so I can really only differentiate with service here. Service could have improved for sure. Twice I asked for a warm batch of new bread, that took an extra 20 minutes to get to me and wasn't even warm (though he said it was ""fresh from the oven"") :( I have waited tables in my past experiences so I don't usually harp on trivial things, but the butter wouldn't even melt on my bread LOL. We didn't get checked on or water refills -- which just confused me because it was past rush hour. Ended up staying here around 2.5 hours for dinner at 7:30 partially because it took so long to get our food. I also wish they did something complimentary cheesecake or something for birthdays, but they only decorate the dessert for you. oh well :( You get a happy birthday song by your server and 1 other unlucky server who happened to be dragged over.

The banana milkshake I asked took a super long time too. For my entree I selected the Mediterranean falafel salad with chicken and was very disappointed but could not send it back for another dish because at this point we were late to our next activity. It was SUPER heavy on kale and very light on dressing, which really did not help with the dryness of the overcooked chicken.

We opted to split some small plates, which was PLENTY for two grown adults. The chicken samosas arrived first. They were flavorful and crisp. The accompanying sauce was tasty as well. Cuban egg rolls came next-they were not my fave. The mustard sauce was thin and the egg roll itself was not cohesive. But it was fine. Nashville nuggets were another small plate we sampled. They are not anything brand new-just chicken nuggets with hot sauce or Buffalo sauce. But they were tasty. The dish in last place was the truffle cheese sticks (bacon truffle cheese sticks? Something like that). Avoid. It was just grease. Flavorless grease. ""Flavorless Grease"" is a great name for a band. Terrible when it describes your food. So overall, our small plates were fine.

We were staying at The Westin in The Galleria. and wanted a nice dinner. Decided to go down to The Cheesecake Factory. We are an adult white couple, (its ashamed that in 2017 people EVEN need to add their race to a review but its an intricate part) The hostess was African American and as we stood at the hostess stand and she finally finished her conversation about her weekend she acknowledged us. No nice greeting no ""How are you""? Just ""How many..?"" We said two and she grabs menus and begins to walk away...we assume we need to follow her and we do. She sets the menus down on the table and walks away, LOL Whatever. As we sat there we noticed two other African American couples and one family get seated by us. We have still not even been greeted by a waiter. I see an AA young man (waiter) go to both the other AA tables and with some very nice banter he took their drink orders. Not ours...we sat and sat and he returned with there drinks and then took both there food orders! As he walked by I asked him if he could please get our waiter, he said ""Ill be right with you.""  After 7 more minutes he walks up to us and no smile, no nice greeting like the other received just say...""want can I get you"". \I asked him are you our waiter or just taking the table because the correct waiter disappeared??

You can enter the restaurant from the second floor of the mall or you can park outside the mall and walk directly into the restaurant. The only parking next to the restaurant are Valet Parking or pay meter.  Me and a co worked came to enjoy a little lunch after helping volunteer at the George R Brown center during hurricane Harvey!  You can always count on this place not being overly crowded for lunch and being able to enjoy a great conversation with some really cool friends or family.   I'm a pasta lover and the Cheesecake Factory is the boss of all pastas!!!  I normally order the Cajun Jambalaya but I order the Louisiana Cajun Chicken pasta!!  It was delicious I'm not a big fan of really spicy foods but the Cajun pastas here seems to be more Cajun spice rub more so than a spicy sauce..   The Louisiana Cajun pasta was not spicy but did have a little kick not too much.  It comes with diced peppers (yellow and green) sautéed and mushrooms I order my pasta without the mushrooms because of food allergy. None the less it was perfect the chicken was lightly fried with a bit of crispy batter and the chicken was not dry at all.   My meal was great, and my Pineapple Mojito was so good and just right!!! My only flaw and I'll make sure to tell my waiter the next time please! light on the mint!!!!

After the server took my order at the walk up register, we stood to the side watching them work and noticed that instead of packing up our cheesecakes, the server/cashier just stood around waiting for someone else to come up and order.  I get that there is an assigned person to pack up the stuff, but if you see that everyone else is busy, how about lend a hand and pack up some of your to-go orders so they don't have to wait so long. I'm pretty patient, but if I see you standing around doing nothing while I'm waiting for you to fulfill my order, that's going to annoy me a little. Also, I watched her as she realized we hadn't gotten our order yet, and it had been over 20 minutes.  She proceeded to fill the order herself, but as she did that, I saw that she licked her finger and used that to grab the wax/tissue paper that they use to grab the cheesecake from their trays. I'm trying not to think about how there's contamination on my cheesecake since we waited so long and had to pay extra for parking just to get the stuff. So if you have an aversion to germs and other people putting their saliva on your food, maybe pay attention to your servers.

I stood there for 5 minutes and not one employee came to seat me. Finally tired of waiting, I sat at the bar. The bartender deserves a 3 star on her own, and she did just enough to get what I needed but didn't or maybe couldn't do anything more. The food is where the worst disappointment was which is sad because if the food had been good, I still would have given a 4 star. Chicken and Biscuits. The biscuits were harder than Thor's hammer, and just as tasty while the chicken was bland (at least it was juicy and hot). The gravy was the worst though, it had the texture of oatmeal that had been overcooked and sitting under a heat lamp all day and had almost no flavor whatsoever.

When we came in the hostess had to finish their conversation before seating us. When we were seated it took ten minutes to be greeted. Once greeted the server asked us our drinks and tried to hurry away once she received the drink order. I told her we were ready for starters, we ordered the artichokes that took forever to arrive and were burnt to a black crisp. We didn't complain and waited for our entrees. I ordered the scampi and steak Diana. I thought it came with noodles but instead it was just 3 shrimp soaked in a white sauce covering half the plate.  Its my fault for not asking if it did or didn't have noodles. But the server didn't know either once i did ask. So I ordered some angel hair on the side to add to my plate of sauce. By the time the noodles arrived my bf was finished eating and my excitement to ever eat here again had vanished. It took forever! She brought it with a side of the scampi sauce obviously made by another cook because it was a completely different color. My bf only ate his strip steak and mashed potatoes but not his green beans because they were Raw. When we walked out I finally saw a manager hanging by the stairs chatting it up with a server.

The food is the absolute epitome of corporate chain fare, the atmosphere is perfect for where you're most likely to find them - in or next two a major shopping mall - and you will never encounter a cocktail that hasn't been carefully planned and focus-tested at the bar. But when you have a waiter as enthusiastic as ours who does such a good job, and the rest of the place holds up its end of the bargain ... I just can't help it. I can justify it under the mediocrity principle,* since one of the reasons chains became popular in the first place is poor quality control among independent restaurants in the pre-McDonald's era. If you have never been to a Cheesecake Factory, you'll probably think it's fine, and if you're a return customer, you already know if you'll like it or not. This is an excellent Cheesecake Factory judged on its own terms, and the staff are great.

190,Preston I.,"Houston, TX",321,88,113.0,5.0,2017-12-24,"Came here for a late Christmas Eve brunch. I really appreciate the feel of this restaurant. It's casual yet well put together at the same time.  I ordered the egg roll sampler and the chicken samosas. They're both technically appetizers, but together they were more than enough for me. The sampler is basically one of each of their egg rolls. The cool part is that they let you trade one out for a roll that you enjoy more, so I traded the Cuban egg roll for another Tex Mex. it was a great decision. The rolls were delicious, and they paired well with the sauces that accompanied them. You get four large egg roll for $11. The samosas were also super good. You get four good-sized ones for $7.  My sister got enchiladas with black beans, and she seemed to like it a lot. My mom ordered the pineapple chicken and shrimp wth rice. She doesn't like eating out that much, but she said that she enjoyed the meal. The service was the best part of the outing. Our waitress, Alexis, was amazing! She had a great, amicable personality and was very helpful. She kept the free bread coming as well and checked on us often. Definitely one of the best servers I've ever encountered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston,2.88,2.7,2.704,,2.7720000000000002
205,Scott W.,"Spring, TX",1,13,1.0,3.0,2017-12-30,We came for dessert.  Our waiter spilled a water to start the evening and it took three trips to get it dried up.  There store was busy but the overall service was middling.  The cheesecake was far from the best we have had and prices a bit higher than some other places but not too bad.  They have a huge variety which was nice.  As I said it was busy.  Our table was being bussed while we were winding down which is disconcerting.  The check came with several to suggestions. The smallest starting at 22%. I'm not excited about this place at all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston,2.84,2.72,2.696,,2.7680000000000002

191,Carmen W.,"Houston, TX",123,131,163.0,1.0,2018-01-02,"Want to hear a funny, but really not funny review? Want to experience the hilarity of this review? Just go the Cheesecake Factory Galleria location!  My mom and I decided to meet one day for lunch here. It's a rare occasion, so we were pretty excited about the time to spend enjoying lunch. I got to the restaurant first, and pretty early. I was sitting outside the restaurant in the small waiting area and a manager (I got his name, and I want to say that it was David, but *disclaimer* that might be totally incorrect, however that is what I will call him for the sake of this review. Either way, he was bald, about 5'11"", and light skinned with an accent.) approached me and asked me ""can I help you?"" Sort of arrogantly. I said ""no"" just as arrogantly back. He looked at me like he was offended, and I thought to myself, ""well, I'd be offended too."" But I kept that thought to myself and told him ""I'm waiting on someone."" While I was waiting, I noticed there was a gift card promotion going on - buy a gift card, get a free cheesecake. I approached the host stand to ask about it, but all I was able to say was ""I have a question about the gift card promotion."" Before the hostess cut me off, and pointed to the to go counter and said ""Gift cards that way."" And went back to tapping away on her little host screen.  I begrudgingly went to the to go counter and got my answer about the gift cards, went back outside to sit, and waited for my mom. Once she got there, we went inside and were greeted by a much nicer hostess who walked us to our table.  Our server, Tony, came and greeted us after a few minutes of us sitting there. He was a good server, I want to emphasize that. It wasn't his fault about what happened next.  He brought us butter and bread. Frozen butter. And cold bread. We were cool with the cold bread, but my mom couldn't handle the frozen, unspreadable butter so she sent it back. When tony returned with the 2nd butter, it too, was frozen. She handed him back the butter, and the 3rd time he brought it, it was finally melted enough to spread. Then my mom received her coke. She could tell by tasting it that it was Diet Coke. She pulled Tony aside and asked him why he'd brought her a Diet Coke, and he said ""how can you tell?!"" Wow. Anyways, he went to the kitchen and came back a few minutes later to apologize to her and explained that ""someone"" in the kitchen had switched the connections between the coke nozzle and Diet Coke nozzle but that it was being fixed. He brought her a new coke once the machine was corrected. It was flat. 100% broke-down, on the side of the road, flat.  We called over the manager, David, and he seemed like we disturbed him from his very busy shift. He nodded and acted interested while my mom told him about our experience thus far. He didn't apologize, he made excuses. While we was making excuses to my mom, I was observing him, and I noticed something strange: he had on a rubber bracelet- the kind that are given out at events with words printed on them. His said in big bold white letters ""Don't be a little b*tch!!!""  I interrupted his excuses and said to him ""Nice bracelet."" I've never seen someone go so rigid and panicky as they came to the realization of their error. He slowly reached down to this wrist and turned the bracelet inside out. He nodded and remained speechless for the first time in minutes. I told him I'd once worked in the restaurant industry for quite some time, and that his behavior and presentation was completely unacceptable. He asked me ""oh yeah? What restaurant?"" Again, no apologies. He changed the subject to something that was irrelevant, and then he excused himself from the table.  At the end of our meal, when Tony dropped off the check, I put my debit card in the check presenter. David came by quickly, took my debit card out, slid it towards me, and said ""Sorry it didn't go so well today."" And as he was walking off refusing to make eye contact with me, I heard him mutter ""maybe next times better."" I'm sorry, but paying for my food doesn't make me forget about the bracelet or the experience. This review needs to be seen by corporate, and that manager needs to be reprimanded and written up. That's all there is to say about that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston,2.88,2.76,2.692,,2.808
204,G T.,"Brownsville, TX",31,51,102.0,5.0,2018-01-05,This place is always good. Had chicken littles. The chicken was very juicy and crispy. The sauces were very good. Service was superb.

195,Leslie G.,"Houston, TX",11,25,29.0,3.0,2018-01-08,"So yes, this is a chain and all but I'd be lying if I said I didn't like it. This location especially. Something about the galleria one always brings nostalgia considering I've been coming here for years. Both the service and the food never disappoints. The portions are large so I always share my entree. Cheesecake wise, they're supposed to be known for it but to be honest, it's just ""ok"". I've had better cheesecake and the variety of choices not only is overwhelming, but dilutes the quality of the cheesecake overalls Another downside is that if you're coming during dinner, expect to wait a bit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston,3.28,2.82,2.704,,3.004
197,April J.,"Falls Church, VA",1,57,8.0,3.0,2018-01-13,"I'm finding that in Texas everything has some type of pepper / spicy flavor when I don't expect it.  I ordered two eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast around noon on a Saturday.  I expected the potatoes to be flavored, but my normal, plain scrambled eggs (not an omelet) had small chunks of green peppers? It was like whatever omelet or fried item was prepared on the griddle before my food wasn't properly cleaned off or was stirred into the eggs? Other than that most of the food tastes like any other Cheesecake Factory. Our tables were close together, I feel like I was on a date with the couple next to me and then a family sat down I could've watched their kids, lol.  Service was excellent  so that was a plus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston,3.24,2.83,2.712,,2.9940000000000007
