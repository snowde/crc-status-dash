We arrived about 7:30pm expecting to wait well over an hour for a holiday, but instead we were told it would only be 35-40 minutes.  How pleased we were when our buzzer vibrated after 15-20 minutes!   Several people attended to us (menus, set-ups, water, bread, and ordering) quickly without being pushy.  We had two food servers, Shelby and Ashley, who were wonderful.  When one was scheduled for a brief break, she brought the other over to introduce us and to make sure we knew what to expect.  This is what customer service is all about.  These two women were pleasant and professional.   Sometimes my husband and I feel cheated because quality service seems to be a thing of the past.  This was not the case on New Year's.  The food at the HB Cheesecake Factory was plentiful and tasty, however, the customer service at this location is why we would return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=840,3.52,3.58,3.496,3.472,3.5560000000000005

1567,Vic C.,"Duarte, United States",107,2377,8717.0,4.0,2012-01-17,"I used to come to this particular location often, like maybe every few months, because it is located in the Bella Terra Plaza. This plaza is a great place to go for a nice date night because you can walk around and check out all of the shops, check out a movie and have your pick of restaurants to dine at afterwards.  Well there is more than enough parking here if you choose to eat at The Cheesecake Factory (right next to Barnes and Noble Bookstore). The restaurant is nice and clean, cheesecake slices are deliciously displayed in the bakery case and restrooms are usually clean and adequately stocked. There is plenty of yummy and tasty foods you can choose from to order, salads, sandwiches, soups, pasta dishes, chicken and mashed potatoes, beef and rice, an array of appetizers and starters, etc. One of my most favorite appetizers to order is the Thai lettuce wraps. This a huge platter of food that can feed 4 or more people. You could also make this a full meal for 2 or 3 people. I love the sauces that come with this dish. The chicken is perfectly seasoned, very moist and tender. This is definitely a fun food to order (but can be messy, so maybe not the best dish to order on a first date).  Portions of whatever you order are generally pretty generous so you will leave satisfied and full. And if you are like me, you will probably fill up on the free bread in the beginning of the meal while you wait for your meal. I love that Cheesecake has a skinnylicious menu (but don't be fooled, these items are still pretty high in calories, so don't think these dishes are calorie free) and also a small plates menu (perfect for a nice late night bite). Now on to the cheesecakes! If you love desserts, then you MUST try one of their delectable flavors. I hope to someday try all of the flavors. I especially love the pumpkin cheesecake when it's in season (I like to call ahead of time to see if it's in). There are also noncheesecake desserts, but I have never tried them. I really want to try them, but I always get side tracked by the long list of cheesecakes.  The pricing here is a bit pricey, but I am willing to pay it because the food is so delicious. The service here has been pretty good, but sometimes on occassion, I have found some not so attentive servers. But it wasn't so bad that I wouldn't continue to come back here.  Oh and there is also the Sunday brunch menu you can try. The brunch menu is just okay, I find the omelettes and the hash to be a bit greasy and oily. The waffles are huge and the french toast is really thick and sweet. It's like eating dessert.  And by the way, if you come here for late night eating, just know that the lighting is dimmed. A bit too dark for me though. I prefer to be able to see what I am eating and be able to see my date better. But of course it's dimmed for the atmosphere. I just wished it was a little bit brighter.  Overall, food is excellent, service is usually pretty good and pricing is acceptable.

You can choose anything from pasta, fish, meat, etc. It's a place to go when you aren't quite sure what you want but they probably have something to take care of your appetite.  My boyfriend and I usually get out the shop pretty late and this place always accommodates us. The serving staff is great even up to the last hours on a saturday night. Always making sure we have enough time before the kitchen closes. Even when the kitchen is about to close everything taste just as good as it would if the place just opened. Their only down fall is delivery. When I call in sometimes, they have to put me on hold to transfer over to the bakery. Sometimes they don't even come back so I have to hang up and call back again. Thank goodness for my patiences because it's really annoying.  Overall this has a great staff, location, and overall the food is amazing.

He was awesome! Made great suggestions on the drink I had.. Strawberry martini... Best drink ever! And the peppermint cheesecake. I was stuffed from the meal but I was so glad I tried the dessert anyways. It was great. My bf had the steak diane and salmon combo. It was delicious. The steak and salmin were separates by mountain of mash potato both with different sauces but goes together very well. The bread was good. I had a reg house salad and I enjoyed that also.

606,Mike F.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,6,,1.0,2012-12-31,"We visited this location last week.  It was our third or fourth visit and it is always the same.  Each time I think I'll give them one more shot at making it better, but it just doesn't happen.  In summary, the food is decent, but the service and the attitude of the employees (including the manager ""Joe"") seems to be, with rare exception, very poor. First let me say that we drive a long way to get there, as we come from Long Beach, and have our family with us making a party of five.  We HATE to wait, so we always try to make a reservation.  While they supposedly do make reservations, their reservation system, if you can call it that, is of absolutely no benefit to their patrons.  The reason is that they only appear to allow reservations when they do not expect to be busy and you would therefore not need a reservation anyway.  Examples?  We wanted a reservation for lunch on the afternoon of Christmas eve.  When I called, I was told that they were only allowing lunch reservations before 11:30 AM  or after 3:15 PM.  I specifically asked the hostess if she meant they were already full between those times or if they simply were not allowing reservations between those times.  She very clearly stated they were not allowing reservations then because they expected to be full with lunch walk-ins.  We made a reservation for five at 3:30 PM, and when we got there the place was no more than half full.  The same situation occurred when I called to try to make a 1:30 PM lunch reservation this morning (12/31).  I was told that they were only allowing reservations for 11:00 AM, which is the time they open.  Why would anyone need a reservation for the time they open... of course they would have tables open at that time. To be fair, I also spoke to the manager ""Joe"" about this issue.  I was told that they expected to be busy and didn't want to be holding tables for 5-10 minutes for the reservations of people who might be late.  I suggested that they simply not hold the table, but rather simply put late arrivals at the top of their waiting list when they did arrive.  He said that would be unfair to those people who had actually been waiting.  I asked if he could explain this, as I saw no logic to this view since if the reservation party had shown up on time the people waiting on the list would still be delayed by the same amount of time until a table opened up.  This seemed to stump him, as there was a long pause before he finally stated that this was simply their policy.  I then asked why they would not allow ""call ahead"" seating, as nearly every other major chain allows, where you could call ahead to be put on the same waiting list you would be on if you walked in and put your name on the list.  I explained that I felt that such a policy was far more respectful of their patrons' time, because a person could call ahead, get an estimate of how long the wait was at that time, get put on the list, and plan to be at the restaurant by the end of the expected wait time, thus eliminating most or all of their wait.  He said he felt this would also be unfair to the people who had walked in an put their name on the list.  When I asked how, he had no specific response.  I explained that many other restaurants, including Claim Jumper, Mimi's Cafe, Outback Steakhouse, Chili's, On The Border, and some Olive Gardens, to name just a few, allowed call ahead seating because they were respectful of their custoimers' time.  Of course, his position was completely unchanged. If not for the fact that my girlfriend likes this place, I would NEVER patronize any Cheesecake Factory (and try to avoid them, if at all possible) due to the generally poor service and their very poor customer service perspectives, despite a decent variety and decent quality of food.  I believe there is no logical explanation for their reservation policy (or the lack of an intelligent one) except that they (1) simply want people to wait in the bar and buy alcohol, thus contributing to upping their sales of alcohol, or (2) simply don't care about the value of time to their customers.  I specifically asked ""Joe"" for any other logical explanation and didn't get one.  As far as I'm concerned, I only want to give my money to retailers who value me, my guests, our time, and our business.  Cheesecake Factory is clearly NOT one of those retailers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=900,3.48,3.51,3.524,2.9800000000000004,3.498
1866,Mike F.,"Rancho Cucamonga, United States",0,6,,1.0,2012-12-31,"We visited this location last week.  It was our third or fourth visit and it is always the same.  Each time I think I'll give them one more shot at making it better, but it just doesn't happen.  In summary, the food is decent, but the service and the attitude of the employees (including the manager ""Joe"") seems to be, with rare exception, very poor. First let me say that we drive a long way to get there, as we come from Long Beach, and have our family with us making a party of five.  We HATE to wait, so we always try to make a reservation.  While they supposedly do make reservations, their reservation system, if you can call it that, is of absolutely no benefit to their patrons.  The reason is that they only appear to allow reservations when they do not expect to be busy and you would therefore not need a reservation anyway.  Examples?  We wanted a reservation for lunch on the afternoon of Christmas eve.  When I called, I was told that they were only allowing lunch reservations before 11:30 AM  or after 3:15 PM.  I specifically asked the hostess if she meant they were already full between those times or if they simply were not allowing reservations between those times.  She very clearly stated they were not allowing reservations then because they expected to be full with lunch walk-ins.  We made a reservation for five at 3:30 PM, and when we got there the place was no more than half full.  The same situation occurred when I called to try to make a 1:30 PM lunch reservation this morning (12/31).  I was told that they were only allowing reservations for 11:00 AM, which is the time they open.  Why would anyone need a reservation for the time they open... of course they would have tables open at that time. To be fair, I also spoke to the manager ""Joe"" about this issue.  I was told that they expected to be busy and didn't want to be holding tables for 5-10 minutes for the reservations of people who might be late.  I suggested that they simply not hold the table, but rather simply put late arrivals at the top of their waiting list when they did arrive.  He said that would be unfair to those people who had actually been waiting.  I asked if he could explain this, as I saw no logic to this view since if the reservation party had shown up on time the people waiting on the list would still be delayed by the same amount of time until a table opened up.  This seemed to stump him, as there was a long pause before he finally stated that this was simply their policy.  I then asked why they would not allow ""call ahead"" seating, as nearly every other major chain allows, where you could call ahead to be put on the same waiting list you would be on if you walked in and put your name on the list.  I explained that I felt that such a policy was far more respectful of their patrons' time, because a person could call ahead, get an estimate of how long the wait was at that time, get put on the list, and plan to be at the restaurant by the end of the expected wait time, thus eliminating most or all of their wait.  He said he felt this would also be unfair to the people who had walked in an put their name on the list.  When I asked how, he had no specific response.  I explained that many other restaurants, including Claim Jumper, Mimi's Cafe, Outback Steakhouse, Chili's, On The Border, and some Olive Gardens, to name just a few, allowed call ahead seating because they were respectful of their custoimers' time.  Of course, his position was completely unchanged.

1319,Duke D.,"Kyle, United States",342,108,502.0,4.0,2013-01-04,"Went here on the Saturday night before Easter Sunday because we were in the area. As soon as we entered, we knew the wait for indoor seating was going to be a while considering the amount of people crowding up the waiting area. So we asked for outdoor seating. Wait was only 10 minutes which was pleasantly surprising. Our waitress was prompt and courteous. Danielle was her name. Anyway, we ordered from the small plates menu since it was late and we didn't want a full on dinner plate. Here's what we got: Santorini Farro Salad Portabella Mushroom, Avocado and Zucchini Fries Fried Zucchini Roasted Pear & Bleu Cheese Flatbread (Pecans, Arugula and Caramelized Onions) For me the flatbread was the night's winner. Just nice balances among the savory, chewy and sweet. I wanted to do a second order to take home but was too full to get anymore. A good one to try out if you're there! In hindsight, we shouldn't have order the fried zucchini AND the Portabella Mushroom, Avocado and Zucchini Fries because the ""zucchini fries"" in the trio were the same as the ""fried zucchini"" order. Batter was okay. Nothing outstanding unless you dip it heavily in the provided dips, which I do not know what they were since we were never told about them as the orders arrived.  Outdoor setting was good. They had those lamp post heaters on so we were all nice and warm. Our waters were refilled promptly.

The service has always been very polite, the food has always been good and I have never had to wait a very long time to be seated. I love that there is a wide variety menu also. Basically, something for everyone. They also have some unusual milkshake alcoholic beverages that are really yummy as long as your not dieting, my god, because they are pretty rich. I've tried the Chocolate Monkey which was very good, almost a dessert in itself. I've also tried a peanut butter and chocolate concoction there also, very rich but very tasty if you like that sort of thing, which I do. Also the ambiance here is very nice. The Cheesecake Factory has a nice but casual feel to it. I also like the decor of this place. I like how at night the restaurant kind of dims its lights. Like I said, casual but nice. They have a great chicken salad sandwich with almond slivers in it to die for! I've also ordered their cheesecakes for birthdays also, which have always been awesome! I love how this restaurant has so much variety in their menu choices and in their cheesecake flavors. Makes for a unique dining experience that not just any restaurant can offer. I am definitely a fan of The Cheesecake Factory. The Cheesecake Factory in Brea and in Anaheim are also very good. This restaurant chain is highly recommended by me.

254,Christina H.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,32,2.0,4.0,2013-01-10,"I'm giving The Cheesecake Factory a 4. 5 for the service, but a 3 for the food.  I've eaten here a few times, but have never written a review before. This trip sparked a need to write a review. Our server, Andre, was exceptional, attentive, and happy, but not overbearing.  The only complaints and issues I have are with the food. I ordered the ""Cajun Chicken 'Littles.'"" With a name like that, I expected a few pieces of a spicy breaded friend chicken.  When another server brought out the PLATTER, I was blown away. It was a platter of fried chicken tenders enough to feed 4 people; it was more like a giant appetizer for a table of people. You get your monies worth with the portion size, but the ""cajun"" chicken had no cajun flavor at all. Big thumbs down. KFC chicken has more flavor than the ""Cajun Chicken 'Littles!'""  Even the honey mustard dipping sauce was weak. I love chicken tenders, but I really wanted something with a kick. The mashed potatoes, which they serve without gravy, were also on the bland and boring side, and to top this off the mashed potatoes were COLD. I had to ask the server to bring me another serving which ended up being warmer than the cold mashed potatoes, but not much warmer than room temp. Sad face. Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake was good though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=720,3.2,3.45,3.54,3.184,3.35
1317,Lynn T.,"Fountain Valley, United States",550,245,740.0,2.0,2013-01-12,"I've never been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory, but I was given a gift card for my birthday back in May so finally decided to use it yesterday (See how long it took me to use it? That's how much I don't really care for this place). When we arrived we were greeted right away and our names were taken down so we could be seated. We waited about 10 mins and was seated in the bar area that they now use for regular dining on the booths. When we sat down, were were told by our server that he would be right with us. We waited 5 mins for him to come back to finally ask what we would like to drink. He brought us back our waters and didn't come back again until we, took about 5 mins to decide what we wanted to eat and FINISHED our complimentary bread and waited some more to finally be able to wave him down to come take our orders.. (that was longer than it should have been) in case you weren't getting my drift.  We ended up ordering their Shrimp Bistro, Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad and their Avocado eggrolls. The avocado eggrolls came out not too long after our order was placed... We finished the eggrolls and were ready for our entree.. we waited, waited and waited.. WAITED to the point that we started picking at the noodles that were used on the appetizer plate to place the eggrolls on. I NEARLY FINISHED the noodles! I was so hungry and waited so long for the food. We never waited that long for our food to come out before. I noticed other tables that ordered after us already got their salad and their food. The server finally came back and apologized for the wait and used the excuse that he wanted us to really enjoy our avocado eggrolls first.. UMMMM I NEARLY cleared the entire plate even the noodles cause you got me waiting so long here.. just bring me my food! Well.. to no surprise.. the food still was not ready and only came back later to tell me.. ""it'll just be a few more minutes"".... I do not want to hear that.. He finally decided to ask if we wanted our salad first so we decided to just have that.. We literally waited a good 20-30 mins before we got our food after waiting 10-15 mins to just get our order in. Not good! He finally brought us our pasta and we were finally happy.. The salad was not that great. It was HUGE! but the taste of it just wasn't good for me.. I had maybe two bites from it. The shrimp bistro was good though, I liked it a lot, but because of the long wait.. I just wasn't feeling it anymore. We ended up boxing up more then half of our salad and pasta after 15 mins of eating our food.  Service is a big deal to me, and I was not too happy with the service we received last night. I most likley will not be back unless I get another gift card or I have no choice. But I was never a fan of The Cheesecake Factory to begin with.

I always ask for a side of bbq sauce, garlic aioli, and ranch with the burger. Now it usually comes with extra items like tomatoes and onions etc. but I am a purist and ask for none of that nonsense! Once you place your hand on the bun and press down, the fried cheese balls burst and even start gushing over the side of your burger. It is extremely beautiful! Since I am on a diet I try to go for a ""lighter"" side by adding sweet potato fries instead of the regular kind.

Now a tip to the host, if we tell you we have 3 people in our party please do not sit us at the half booths! This is awkward and tight. Especially if I am a little larger than the rest of my party. The problem is when I am meeting new people for a business meeting I don't want to create a scene and ask you to move us after one person has already been sitting waiting.

Was heading home from LA and decided to grab a bite here. People were already waiting outside and we expected at least a 30 minute wait. We were told 10-15 minutes and I thought that was doubtful but shocked after 10 minutes were seated. Sat outside on the patio and it was nice and warm and the gazebo added such a nice feel to the atmosphere. Our server came immediately, her name was Rachel and she had the sweetest disposition and great smile. Drinks and warm hot bread were served right away. The menu had some great selections and they had a separate menu called Skinnylicious, items were 590 calories or less. I liked that they serve breakfast all day too because sometimes I love breakfast for dinner. We ordered steak and a chicken sandwich, both served with fries(very good) and the steak had onion rings as well. Everything was delicious. Our server kept the water filled and checked on us, still with that great smile. After dinner we ordered cheesecake to go, always so decadent! I was so impressed on a Saturday night that everything went so perfectly. Even the valet parked the car close because we had a bunch of things inside that we were concerned about. $5.00 for valet was cheap and well worth peace of mind. I had to make a point of letting the manager know our server was awesome and the experience was exceptional. Oftentimes chains do not seemed to be as concerned because they have established themselves but this location and service was a stand out, therefore 5 stars.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=640,3.72,3.56,3.564,3.3800000000000003,3.6240000000000006

Well my visit went along with my expectations but surprisingly, my party of 12 were seated within half an hour which was pleasant. We got our drink orders maybe 10 minutes after sitting. The bad part was that it took them 20 minutes to send over somebody to take our orders. Just because we're a big party and we're instantly charged gratuity no matter what doesn't mean they can take their sweet time to deliver subpar service.  I'd imagine a reasonable wait because any real restaurant would attempt to send over the entire table top at the same time. The only problem with that is that a member of my party actually ended up getting served the wrong food and the waitress was insistent that that was what she ordered. I didn't know vegetarians ordered some kind of chicken sandwich. My friend must have been mistaken because she looked like she definitely ordered that and was obviously confused. However, I was lucky enough to get the dish that I ordered. I had the sheppard's pie and although I had an image in my head of what it would look like (and it came out looking different from most traditional servings of it), the taste was fairly on point. Nice mashed potatoes, good amount of vegetables that weren't cooked to kingdom come, the beef wasn't anything special, but overall, comfort food done alright. Just an average experience. Nothing too special. Nothing too terrible besides the neglect of service.

Wait was only 10 minutes which was pleasantly surprising. Our waitress was prompt and courteous. Danielle was her name. Anyway, we ordered from the small plates menu since it was late and we didn't want a full on dinner plate. Here's what we got: Santorini Farro Salad Portabella Mushroom, Avocado and Zucchini Fries Fried Zucchini Roasted Pear & Bleu Cheese Flatbread (Pecans, Arugula and Caramelized Onions) For me the flatbread was the night's winner. Just nice balances among the savory, chewy and sweet. I wanted to do a second order to take home but was too full to get anymore. A good one to try out if you're there! In hindsight, we shouldn't have order the fried zucchini AND the Portabella Mushroom, Avocado and Zucchini Fries because the ""zucchini fries"" in the trio were the same as the ""fried zucchini"" order. Batter was okay. Nothing outstanding unless you dip it heavily in the provided dips, which I do not know what they were since we were never told about them as the orders arrived.

My favorite is the Miso Salmon lunch $13.95 - lovely portion of perfectly cooked salmon, on a bed of white or brown rice, a few snap peas to surround it, and served with two sauces.  Tip: I always ask for extra white and  brown sauce on the side. Firecracker Salmon appetizers is another favorite (apparantly there is a smaller version on the SkinnyLicious menu!)  They offer a GREAT raspberry Martini too. Yes, this place is a chain, but what they do, they do so well:  their service is usually efficient, friendly and the portions so big I always share with a friend.  Plus their cheesecakes are really delectable.   The only thing I dislike:  they are famous for long waits during busy times... ah, well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=300,3.52,3.53,3.54,3.8240000000000003,3.5260000000000002

584,Lilian L.,"Midway City, CA",0,1,,4.0,2013-04-25,"Cheesecake factory, a fancy restaurant, can be an astonishing place to dine at  for a birthday dinner. It was great service and a waitress who welcome people the second they step in. There's not many cheesecake factories around Orange County. In fact, there are only 3 located around Orange County. One in Newport, Huntington Beach and Anaheim. Cheesecake factory has always been a busy place. Especially on weekends and occasions, an abundance of people come out to eat. Cheesecake Factory is not like any other restaurant.             The menu is a size of a bible. Their menu has over 200 different type of foods made from scratch each day. Combines to make an appetizing taste to everyone's tummy. Moreover, Cheesecake Factory have a portion of skinnylicious and small snack plates for those who stay fit and eat healthy. Just keep in mind that Cheesecake Factory has many varieties to choose from even for people who are eating healthy. So, this is definitely a place to go to if you haven't yet tried it already. There's also dessert like cheesecake and that obviously what this place is most known for. Known for their cheesecake. Many different flavors of cheesecake. Of course, original cheesecake too if you don't like any of the flavors that there is.             I've only been to Cheesecake Factory 5 times but I absolutely love it here! I've always wanted to try every single dish that they have. But, i only come here every so often. Only for occasional celebrations. The last time I've been here was for my friend's birthday. I honestly love the pasta here! Depending on what I crave that day, I usually only choose to look at the portion of pastas. It's the first thing I look for as soon as I grab onto the menu. Pasta Da Vinci is my favorite. The sauce is a light orange color that tastes just like thousand island salad dressing. The pasta is topped with sauteed chicken, mushrooms, onions and parmesan cheese. The taste of the creamy sauce is so delish. Melts into my mouths and feels as if I'm in heaven. All I think about is the greatness of how hot and tender the chicken and mushrooms are. Just by thinking about the name ""Pasta Da Vinci"" makes me ravenous already.            The location of cheescake factory that I go to is the one in Bella Terra on Edinger. Cheesecake factory is right next to Starbucks and right across from Buffalo Wild  Wings. There's not a problem about people wanting to sit outside and eat because there's a patio. Customers don't often complain about feeling frigid because there are fire pits and heaters to keep warmth surrounding the area. Workers try to satisfy their customers as much as possible and provide more than just a sufficient service towards everyone. The Cheesecake factory always has calming music for people to social with one another and the customer always seems to be jovial. This location at Bella terra is just like any other ones in Orange County. They're all the same and a utopian place to eat at every once in awhile but not a place to eat at daily. Thats why, its most known for having birthday dinners, going out on a date, or other gatherings               Overall, I rate this place a 9 out 10 because of the marvelous taste of different foods they have. I recommend to eat here. For ""first timers"" who haven't been here, its an amazing place. Not only the great taste of the foods but also the great service as well! Cheesecake factory fulfills my satisfaction and I can never be disappointed with anything that they serve. With over 200 types of foods in a large menu booklet, Theres not one thing that I don't like. The portion of different kinds of foods are so large that people often get lost in sight of what they want. In my opinion, definitely try to the pastas! I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do.

Basically, something for everyone. They also have some unusual milkshake alcoholic beverages that are really yummy as long as your not dieting, my god, because they are pretty rich. I've tried the Chocolate Monkey which was very good, almost a dessert in itself. I've also tried a peanut butter and chocolate concoction there also, very rich but very tasty if you like that sort of thing, which I do. Also the ambiance here is very nice. The Cheesecake Factory has a nice but casual feel to it. I also like the decor of this place. I like how at night the restaurant kind of dims its lights. Like I said, casual but nice. They have a great chicken salad sandwich with almond slivers in it to die for! I've also ordered their cheesecakes for birthdays also, which have always been awesome! I love how this restaurant has so much variety in their menu choices and in their cheesecake flavors. Makes for a unique dining experience that not just any restaurant can offer. I am definitely a fan of The Cheesecake Factory. The Cheesecake Factory in Brea and in Anaheim are also very good. This restaurant chain is highly recommended by me.

Well my visit went along with my expectations but surprisingly, my party of 12 were seated within half an hour which was pleasant. We got our drink orders maybe 10 minutes after sitting. The bad part was that it took them 20 minutes to send over somebody to take our orders. Just because we're a big party and we're instantly charged gratuity no matter what doesn't mean they can take their sweet time to deliver subpar service.  I'd imagine a reasonable wait because any real restaurant would attempt to send over the entire table top at the same time. The only problem with that is that a member of my party actually ended up getting served the wrong food and the waitress was insistent that that was what she ordered. I didn't know vegetarians ordered some kind of chicken sandwich. My friend must have been mistaken because she looked like she definitely ordered that and was obviously confused. However, I was lucky enough to get the dish that I ordered. I had the sheppard's pie and although I had an image in my head of what it would look like (and it came out looking different from most traditional servings of it), the taste was fairly on point. Nice mashed potatoes, good amount of vegetables that weren't cooked to kingdom come, the beef wasn't anything special, but overall, comfort food done alright. Just an average experience.

431,Claire G.,"Long Beach, CA",252,89,79.0,5.0,2013-08-11,"My family and I ordered the following when we visited The Cheesecake Factory: Fresh Kale Salad, Stuffed Mushrooms, Crispy Crab Bites, Thai Lettuce Wraps, Steak Diane, Chargrilled Coulotte Steak, Banana Cheesecake and Original Cheesecake. The Fresh Kale Salad was served with cranberries, apples, marcona almonds and green beans tossed with a Buttermilk-Black Pepper Dressing. Although this menu item is listed under the small plates and snacks, the serving size was enough for my husband and I to share. We asked for the dressing on the side, so that we could control how much dressing to put because we don't like our salads drenched in dressing. We will definitely order this salad again because it is healthy, fresh, and delicious! The Stuffed Mushrooms were also listed under the small plates and snacks menu item, so we got 6 bite sized stuffed mushrooms that I shared with my husband. The mushrooms are stuffed with fontina and parmesan cheese, garlic and herbs in a wine sauce. We will definitely order this menu item again because it was very yummy! The Crispy Crab Bites are featured in the small plates and snacks menu as well as in the SkinnyLicious Menu. These bite-sized little crab cakes are served with mustard sauce. This item tasted okay. There was nothing special about the flavors, so I will most likely not order this menu item again. The Thai Lettuce Wraps are featured under the Appetizers menu. When you receive this item, you will be amazed by the display of food and colors!  All of the ingredients are laid out on a boat shaped dish, so that you can create your own lettuce tacos!  Ingredients: Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Coconut Curry Noodles and Lettuce Leaves with three delicious Spicy Thai Sauces - Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamarind-Cashew. The mixture of all of these ingredients will burst into your mouth!  This dish is a bit messy, but definitely fun, colorful, and flavorful!  I will definitely order this menu item in future visits! Steak Diane: I asked the server about the most ordered menu item and he recommended the Steak Diane. This certified angus beef steak is adequately covered with black peppercorns and a rich mushroom wine sauce (with few pieces of mushrooms) and served with perfectly mashed potatoes and grilled onions. This meal was by far, my most favorite menu item!  The portion sizes are large, so I was only able to eat half of what was provided.  This meal tasted even better for lunch the next day! My husband and daughter ordered the Chargrilled Coulotte Steak (Prime Sirloin). Although this steak is served with French Fries and Crispy Onion Rings, both my husband and daughter substituted this part with steamed broccoli.  From what I heard, they both enjoyed the steak and broccoli very much.  The steak was nice and tender and the sauce from the steak was delicious! Dessert: I shared a Banana Cheesecake with my husband and our daughter ordered the Original Cheesecake. The cheesecake tasted like bananas and the sliced bananas that covered the cheesecake were fresh. This cheesecake wasn't rich and sweet, which is exactly what I like! I will definitely order the banana cheesecake the next time I visit The Cheesecake Factory! Don't forget to try the fresh, warm, and delicious rye bread that is provided as soon as you sit down at your table.  Slather some of their sweet butter on that rye bread to get a taste of it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=540,3.36,3.69,3.592,3.8600000000000003,3.5580000000000003

I've had the chicken marsala, grilled salmon, shrimp pasta, and calamari. - I love the ambiance of this place because of the low lighting, the low murmuring sound of people talking, and the marble floor and columns. - The waiters are pretty attentive to your needs. Even if they are constantly running around, they always stop by to ask if you need anything several times. - They give you a buzzer so you can browse the shops in the mall while you wait to be seated.  CONS: - There is usually a wait on nights and weekends that can last more than 1 hr. I don't go here for regular meals because I can't afford the time to wait. I only go here occasionally.  - It can be a little pricey here. - One time I had the shrimp pasta and it was super salty!

All I care about is the Mac N' Cheese Burger.. A burger consisting of fried cheese balls, cheddar cheese sauce, and medium rare beef patty all sandwiched between two fluffy slices of bread. I always ask for a side of bbq sauce, garlic aioli, and ranch with the burger. Now it usually comes with extra items like tomatoes and onions etc. but I am a purist and ask for none of that nonsense! Once you place your hand on the bun and press down, the fried cheese balls burst and even start gushing over the side of your burger. It is extremely beautiful! Since I am on a diet I try to go for a ""lighter"" side by adding sweet potato fries instead of the regular kind.

I've eaten here a few times, but have never written a review before. This trip sparked a need to write a review. Our server, Andre, was exceptional, attentive, and happy, but not overbearing.  The only complaints and issues I have are with the food. I ordered the ""Cajun Chicken 'Littles.'"" With a name like that, I expected a few pieces of a spicy breaded friend chicken.  When another server brought out the PLATTER, I was blown away. It was a platter of fried chicken tenders enough to feed 4 people; it was more like a giant appetizer for a table of people. You get your monies worth with the portion size, but the ""cajun"" chicken had no cajun flavor at all. Big thumbs down. KFC chicken has more flavor than the ""Cajun Chicken 'Littles!'""  Even the honey mustard dipping sauce was weak. I love chicken tenders, but I really wanted something with a kick. The mashed potatoes, which they serve without gravy, were also on the bland and boring side, and to top this off the mashed potatoes were COLD. I had to ask the server to bring me another serving which ended up being warmer than the cold mashed potatoes, but not much warmer than room temp. Sad face.

Now a tip to the host, if we tell you we have 3 people in our party please do not sit us at the half booths! This is awkward and tight. Especially if I am a little larger than the rest of my party. The problem is when I am meeting new people for a business meeting I don't want to create a scene and ask you to move us after one person has already been sitting waiting. And the other piece of advice it's ok if a couple of crumbs are on the table no need to reach over and clean it off while we are finishing our conversation. Sorry guys other than that you are awesome! Those are just a couple tips to put you above the rest in your own elite customer service category. Thank you for being so attentive though.

1119,Erin N.,"Las Vegas, United States",1593,435,2521.0,4.0,2013-10-12,"Cheesecake Factory-- the best place to go if you can't decide on what you feel like eating.  Seriously, the Factory has so many choices on their menu. From pasta to sandwiches, to shepards pie to BBQ chicken pizza, to carb conscious healthy options to a California omelette; there is something for everyone. Their menu is more like a novel with at least twelve pages of food options to please everybody at the table. As if it wasn't already hard enough to make a decision on what to eat, there are also pages of advertisement in the menu. With my short attention span and the ridiculous length of the menu, our server always has to come back like three times before I know what I want to order. Yeah, I'm THAT person. Embarrassing! Just don't forget to bring your reading glasses to dinner-- the lighting is dim in the restaurant and you have some serious homework to do. Here's a list of my favs: - Huevos Rancheros: SO simple, yet my favorite breakfast option here. Crispy quesadilla, cheese, black beans, eggs and salsa is a perfect combination and they do it so well here. - Everything Pizza: Sausage, pepperoni, olives, and more on a perfectly baked crust. Nom! - Seared Tuna Tataki Salad: Healthy and delish! Seared Tuna on a delicious bed of greens. My go to salad when I want something light, yet filling.  Oh, and I should mention servings are HUGE. Sharing a salad or an entree is probably a smart idea! Plus, you know-- gotta leave room for dessert. After all, this is the Cheesecake Factory we are talking about here.  FYI: Lunch specials are also offered before 4pm. Sunday Brunch is also offered until 2pm.   I have been to plenty of Cheesecake Factories but this location is probably my favorite. I like the layout of the restaurant and the outside patio area, not to mention the service here is always excellent. There is also valet for a few dollars, which comes in handy as Bella Terra is always busy on the weekends and the parking structure is quite a walk away.  Cheesecake MUSTS: - Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake! My absolute favorite! - Smore's Cheesecake-- so so SO decadent. Must share with at least three people or your face will fall off from the richness of this cheesecake. - Banana Cream Cheesecake! if you love the pie you will love this cheesecake.  - Red Velvet Cheesecake! This is such the perfect combination, you can't go wrong with this one.  But seriously though, how this place always gets me to order cheesecake for dessert, despite being ridiculously full is beyond me.

We continued to wait. Then 2 next groups of 3 got called to be seated. Still no sign of calling us. So my boyfriend asked again. Now the boy told us that he forgot where he left our ticket at. This is just totally ridiculous, something that i didnt expect from an American restaurant. We just left. Total waste of time. This is also the 1st time coming here. Since we want to give it a try.

1394,Claire G.,"Long Beach, United States",252,93,79.0,5.0,2013-11-08,"My family and I ordered the following when we visited The Cheesecake Factory: Fresh Kale Salad, Stuffed Mushrooms, Crispy Crab Bites, Thai Lettuce Wraps, Steak Diane, Chargrilled Coulotte Steak, Banana Cheesecake and Original Cheesecake. The Fresh Kale Salad was served with cranberries, apples, marcona almonds and green beans tossed with a Buttermilk-Black Pepper Dressing. Although this menu item is listed under the small plates and snacks, the serving size was enough for my husband and I to share. We asked for the dressing on the side, so that we could control how much dressing to put because we don't like our salads drenched in dressing. We will definitely order this salad again because it is healthy, fresh, and delicious! The Stuffed Mushrooms were also listed under the small plates and snacks menu item, so we got 6 bite sized stuffed mushrooms that I shared with my husband. The mushrooms are stuffed with fontina and parmesan cheese, garlic and herbs in a wine sauce. We will definitely order this menu item again because it was very yummy! The Crispy Crab Bites are featured in the small plates and snacks menu as well as in the SkinnyLicious Menu. These bite-sized little crab cakes are served with mustard sauce. This item tasted okay. There was nothing special about the flavors, so I will most likely not order this menu item again. The Thai Lettuce Wraps are featured under the Appetizers menu. When you receive this item, you will be amazed by the display of food and colors!  All of the ingredients are laid out on a boat shaped dish, so that you can create your own lettuce tacos!  Ingredients: Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Coconut Curry Noodles and Lettuce Leaves with three delicious Spicy Thai Sauces - Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamarind-Cashew. The mixture of all of these ingredients will burst into your mouth!  This dish is a bit messy, but definitely fun, colorful, and flavorful!  I will definitely order this menu item in future visits! Steak Diane: I asked the server about the most ordered menu item and he recommended the Steak Diane. This certified angus beef steak is adequately covered with black peppercorns and a rich mushroom wine sauce (with few pieces of mushrooms) and served with perfectly mashed potatoes and grilled onions. This meal was by far, my most favorite menu item!  The portion sizes are large, so I was only able to eat half of what was provided.  This meal tasted even better for lunch the next day! My husband and daughter ordered the Chargrilled Coulotte Steak (Prime Sirloin). Although this steak is served with French Fries and Crispy Onion Rings, both my husband and daughter substituted this part with steamed broccoli.  From what I heard, they both enjoyed the steak and broccoli very much.  The steak was nice and tender and the sauce from the steak was delicious! Dessert: I shared a Banana Cheesecake with my husband and our daughter ordered the Original Cheesecake. The cheesecake tasted like bananas and the sliced bananas that covered the cheesecake were fresh. This cheesecake wasn't rich and sweet, which is exactly what I like! I will definitely order the banana cheesecake the next time I visit The Cheesecake Factory! Don't forget to try the fresh, warm, and delicious rye bread that is provided as soon as you sit down at your table.  Slather some of their sweet butter on that rye bread to get a taste of it!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=540,3.48,3.82,3.632,3.2840000000000003,3.684

That's how much I don't really care for this place). When we arrived we were greeted right away and our names were taken down so we could be seated. We waited about 10 mins and was seated in the bar area that they now use for regular dining on the booths. When we sat down, were were told by our server that he would be right with us. We waited 5 mins for him to come back to finally ask what we would like to drink. He brought us back our waters and didn't come back again until we, took about 5 mins to decide what we wanted to eat and FINISHED our complimentary bread and waited some more to finally be able to wave him down to come take our orders.. (that was longer than it should have been) in case you weren't getting my drift.  We ended up ordering their Shrimp Bistro, Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad and their Avocado eggrolls. The avocado eggrolls came out not too long after our order was placed... We finished the eggrolls and were ready for our entree.. we waited, waited and waited.. WAITED to the point that we started picking at the noodles that were used on the appetizer plate to place the eggrolls on. I NEARLY FINISHED the noodles! I was so hungry and waited so long for the food. We never waited that long for our food to come out before. I noticed other tables that ordered after us already got their salad and their food. The server finally came back and apologized for the wait and used the excuse that he wanted us to really enjoy our avocado eggrolls first.. UMMMM I NEARLY cleared the entire plate even the noodles cause you got me waiting so long here.. just bring me my food! Well.. to no surprise.. the food still was not ready and only came back later to tell me.. ""it'll just be a few more minutes"".... I do not want to hear that.. He finally decided to ask if we wanted our salad first so we decided to just have that.. We literally waited a good 20-30 mins before we got our food after waiting 10-15 mins to just get our order in. Not good! He finally brought us our pasta and we were finally happy.. The salad was not that great. It was HUGE! but the taste of it just wasn't good for me.. I had maybe two bites from it. The shrimp bistro was good though, I liked it a lot, but because of the long wait.. I just wasn't feeling it anymore. We ended up boxing up more then half of our salad and pasta after 15 mins of eating our food.  Service is a big deal to me, and I was not too happy with the service we received last night.

The medallions came out medium and therefore lost its juiciness. Mashed potato was on point -soft and buttery. Lastly, I had the garlic chicken noodle. Noodle was al dente so no issue there. However, the bf bite into the drumstick and found the chicken undercooked.  I should have taken a picture of it. The chicken inside was between red and borderline pink.  I told the waitress to please tell the chefs that the chicken was not fully cooked.  She took out plates and that was it. No acknowledgement.

Other than that it's a nice atmosphere, noisy which just means people are having a good time & talking, etc service was good, appetizer was good: the calamari was nice & crispy. My chopped salad was good, one of my faves. My friend laughed at her small sandwich & salad which was on the lite menu but we told her that's how they keep it light. We ordered a chocolate Sunday too share, they put lots of whip cream on it & some ice cream. We wanted cheesecake but we left the decision to our friend who had been craving a Sunday. It was a great night out with the girlfriends.

Came here last night for an early anniversary celebration with my boyfriend. First of all, the hosts/hostesses said it would be a 10 minute wait which turned into more than half an hour! I even heard another couple get annoyed at this. Our server (Martha) would literally SLAM every single plate on our table, practically spear-tossed a straw into my drink with her bare hands (ew), hardly checked on us and was just overall snotty and condescending. She high-key even had the audacity to check if we left a tip before she took our check away, as if she deserved it. Martha is the worst server ever! Food was quite disappointing. I got my favorite Chicken di Pana; broccoli was overcooked, the ""creamy sauce"" just tasted like heavy cream with no seasoning and some parts of my mashed potatoes were cold. My boyfriend got the Fried Chicken platter, he said it was okay and that the corn was good but it looked like a fancier version of what you can get at KFC. Lol. On the bright side, the calamari wasn't half bad. The fact that we had a snot-nosed brat stuck inside a 30-35 year old woman's body as a server kind of irked our experience. Ps.

I mean congrats babe?  Anyways, after a quick 10 minute wait (Thursday night), we got our booth for 4.  The service here is always very nice, but also consistently slow.  For example, our water would always check in with us every time he walked by, but when we asked for more bread, it wasn't at our table for another 10 mintues.  I think the servers there are maybe a bit understaffed because they always seem to be rushing somewhere to help with another table.   Drinks: I'm the only table alcoholic, so I was the only one to order a drink.  I got a Hendricks Tonic w/ Lime and Cucumber and I gotta say they have pretty heavy pours here.  definitely not complaining though haha. Food: I'm actually not a really big fan of their food here.  We always seem to get calamari for the app and without fail, each time we order it, it gets smaller and smaller!  Last night's calamari was a plate with a napkin folded in half on it, with the actual calamari only put on top of that half napkin... it was honestly only good for 1 person's worth of food.  For entrees, my lady for some unbeknownst reason, swears by their chicken fettecini alfredo with sun dried tomatoes.  I guess she really loves bland sauce tossed with store bought (my guess) pasta and a couple of sun dried tomatoes thrown on top... but who knows?  maybe I'm the one with a terrible palate.  I ordered the chicken little - fried chicken breast strips with mash and veggies.  Let me clarify, this plate isn't bad, but also isn't great.  I only got it because I remembered it was huge - and this time was no exception.  After getting some sriracha (obviously), I devoured the plate and was definitely full. Dessert: Our awesome waiter came up to us towards the end of our meal and apologized for the slow service.  To make up for it, he actually threw in a free slice of cheesecake!  *CUE heavens opening up and harp music. We let him surprise us with his favorite underrated slice and a minute later he showed up with a S'Mores Cheesecake slice.  I was a bit skeptical, but after my first bite, SOLD!  The S'mores CC is amazing here.  It comes with a golden brown marhmellow melted over a rich creamy chocolate cheesecake, topped with whipped cream.  I don't think I wouldve been able to finish it by myself, so sharing was perfect for us 4.

First of all, the hosts/hostesses said it would be a 10 minute wait which turned into more than half an hour! I even heard another couple get annoyed at this. Our server (Martha) would literally SLAM every single plate on our table, practically spear-tossed a straw into my drink with her bare hands (ew), hardly checked on us and was just overall snotty and condescending. She high-key even had the audacity to check if we left a tip before she took our check away, as if she deserved it. Martha is the worst server ever! Food was quite disappointing. I got my favorite Chicken di Pana; broccoli was overcooked, the ""creamy sauce"" just tasted like heavy cream with no seasoning and some parts of my mashed potatoes were cold. My boyfriend got the Fried Chicken platter, he said it was okay and that the corn was good but it looked like a fancier version of what you can get at KFC. Lol. On the bright side, the calamari wasn't half bad. The fact that we had a snot-nosed brat stuck inside a 30-35 year old woman's body as a server kind of irked our experience. Ps.

Even Nancy took a bite and could not believe it. I had to send it back and our waiter was nice enough to ask whether I wanted a different dish or the same after he explained why it was too salty. I asked for the same and after a few minutes my new dish was out. He waited until I tried it before he left and it was perfect. So tastey and not salty at all! Thats great service. Plus he was very friendly too! I just forgot his name.

The Cheesecake Factory is best known across the globe for its extensive and creative menu, generous portions, distinctive decor and legendary desserts. With more than 250 menu selections - all handmade, in-house with fresh ingredients - and more than 50 signature cheesecakes and desserts, there is truly ""Something for everyone"" at The Cheesecake Factory. It was my Mom's Birthday and she got a gift card from one of her co-workers so we all when out on a Tuesday night for Birthday dinner. When we arrived we were greeted right away which was nice. I gave them our name and within a few minutes they took us to our table. We sat in the giant booth that fits 7 people in the center of the room. Everything was looking good so far. Our waitress seemed a little overwhelmed and tired she was saying weird thing but we took it with a grain of salt. We told her were just sat down and needed a few minutes to look over what we wanted to order. Well we shouldn't have said that because literally she never came back. Ha ha we waiting for like 20 minutes an then I said enough of this so I waved down another server to get us started with Drinks. I know just drink right. Horrible!  Then when it came time to order our food our same original server came back and she was a wreck, she looked horrible. Her hair was a mess and all sweaty and it seem like she was inconvenienced to take our order.  I was thinking at that time if I were her boss I would have had a talk with her saying either get it together or go home. We ordered our food and each plate had different things that were requested and of course when we got our meal it was missing sides and not cooked the way we wanted it so on and so forth. The recap was their service level was a 1 out of 10 and they food was okay but not what we expected. I mean it was a Tuesday night and it was a slow, so there shouldn't be any excuses as to why everything sucked. My Mom used to love this place now after this bad experience she probably will never go back again.  That server f-ed it up for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=580,3.2,3.52,3.628,2.6960000000000006,3.392000000000001

First off I gotta say the staff near the bar area are very inattentive, had to wait a while before we could order, when I finally ordered and received my food, the server disappeared, did not check up on us, and in the middle of my steak, and mashed potatoes, I pulled out a long hair. Disgusting!!!! I had to wait about 10 min for the server to come around so I could let her know about the incident.

Their gigantic menu has pretty much everything. I do like the Gumbo and Cajun Pasta. Its a commercialized version of what the real stuff  tastes like but hey, compared to the rest of the menu there's actually some spice and semblance of flavor that rises above the masses-will-eat kind of bland. Now the good stuff: wheat bread?  Whatever the darker bread they start you off with. It's bomb. Ask for more. The cheesecakes. Omg love. It's not frou frou fancy gourmet dessert but damn it's good. Rich and ridiculously fattening. Everything a guilty dessert is suppose to be. The Godiva is a must for chocolate lovers and the S'mores cheesecake is just as amazing as it sounds.

We waited to be sat in the dinning room but then were walked to be sat in the corner of the bar. We were in a booth so we thought...ugh...this isn't that bad! Well...we sat for a while and after hearing a full conversation with our server and the host which included him stating that he did not know why he was being sat and that if he could please not be sat anymore he would greatly appreciate it...he said hello. He told us he was having a horrible night and couldn't wait to get out of there and being a server myself through college know exactly what he was talking about but in the customer service industry I do not think it is at all appropriate to communicate this fact with your client!! So...the night did not get any better. My husband was hungry and I wasn't sure what I wanted yet so I told him to order...but clearly held on to the menu to order in just a bit. He never came back and because we were in the corner no one walked by...my initial reaction was to chase someone down but my husband is a bit more reserved and asked that stay put! So my husbands food came...I shared because I was hungry too! His food was done...I finally then got my glass of wine I ordered. Never were asked how everything was...then  my husband had to ask for the check and he dropped it off and walked away. That was it! I never got any food...or even had the opportunity to order.

I've heard people say its pumpernickel, I've heard people say its wheat - I've heard lots of things, so I am sticking to calling it the BROWN BREAD. I can just eat that & i'll be happy.  But, that's not really a meal now.. so i ordered the Cajun Chicken Littles & my boyfriend ordered the fish & chips. Everything came out great. Our Waitress was really nice, I believe her name was Haley or something. Nice restaurant inside a nice shopping plaza.

1439,Westley Y.,"Fountain Valley, United States",86,436,1415.0,2.0,2014-06-05,"This Restaurant is located on the backside of the Bella Terra Shopping Center. The Cheesecake Factory is best known across the globe for its extensive and creative menu, generous portions, distinctive decor and legendary desserts. With more than 250 menu selections - all handmade, in-house with fresh ingredients - and more than 50 signature cheesecakes and desserts, there is truly ""Something for everyone"" at The Cheesecake Factory. It was my Mom's Birthday and she got a gift card from one of her co-workers so we all when out on a Tuesday night for Birthday dinner. When we arrived we were greeted right away which was nice. I gave them our name and within a few minutes they took us to our table. We sat in the giant booth that fits 7 people in the center of the room. Everything was looking good so far. Our waitress seemed a little overwhelmed and tired she was saying weird thing but we took it with a grain of salt. We told her were just sat down and needed a few minutes to look over what we wanted to order. Well we shouldn't have said that because literally she never came back. Ha ha we waiting for like 20 minutes an then I said enough of this so I waved down another server to get us started with Drinks. I know just drink right. Horrible!  Then when it came time to order our food our same original server came back and she was a wreck, she looked horrible. Her hair was a mess and all sweaty and it seem like she was inconvenienced to take our order.  I was thinking at that time if I were her boss I would have had a talk with her saying either get it together or go home. We ordered our food and each plate had different things that were requested and of course when we got our meal it was missing sides and not cooked the way we wanted it so on and so forth. The recap was their service level was a 1 out of 10 and they food was okay but not what we expected. I mean it was a Tuesday night and it was a slow, so there shouldn't be any excuses as to why everything sucked. My Mom used to love this place now after this bad experience she probably will never go back again.  That server f-ed it up for us.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=580,3.12,3.35,3.592,2.6320000000000006,3.258

I came in here with my family celebrating my graduation. First off I gotta say the staff near the bar area are very inattentive, had to wait a while before we could order, when I finally ordered and received my food, the server disappeared, did not check up on us, and in the middle of my steak, and mashed potatoes, I pulled out a long hair. Disgusting!!!! I had to wait about 10 min for the server to come around so I could let her know about the incident. She took the plate and the manager came over, offered me a free side salad, as if that was going to make it up, and that was the end of it.

First off, I gotta say if you don't valet your car then you're missing out, but that isn't a part of The Cheesecake Factory. So my girlfriend and I got there and immediately I checked in and the host told me 10-15 minutes for a party of two. As soon as I got the pager, I turned around to wait outside, but I only made it to the door and the pager went off. I saw they printed out my name with a table number on it and I was like wow that was fast. I overheard a party of 5 would take 30-45 minutes to be seated. These hosts were awesome and I think that hosts are under appreciated in the restaurant business. So we sit down at our 2 top table and it's a little small and usually I would have asked for a booth, but on a busy night, I was lucky to get a table as fact as I did, so I wasn't about to ask to move. Our server was Kenny and he was great. I ordered 2 waters and an ultimate margarita for my girlfriend and I. Kenny brought them along with the bread. I took a drink of my Ultimate Margarita and it was too sweet, so I stirred it a bit, but it was still too sweet (wasn't his fault maybe the bartender messed up or CF's recipe uses alot of sweet and sour). So when Kenny came around I told him that my margarita had too much sweet and sour and that I wanted to get a mojito instead and it was delicious. Then we ordered our appetizers, spinach dip and potstickers, and our meal at the same time, Meatloaf and Chicken Madeira, the only problem with the appetizers was that the spinach dip was too cold, so I asked Kenny to heat it up abit and he did, easy fix. The manager came around as our food came out to apologize about the wait. My girlfriend and I didn't even notice the wait. I saved room for dessert and Kenny packed up all our leftovers for us and even gave us great recommendations for dessert. We were full so we decided to order our dessert to-go and eat it when we got home. We got the Kahlua cheesecake and the reese cup cheesecake for our roommates. Kenny brought our check and we had about $88 and 20% is about $17-$18, but we didn't want to break any bills, so we left him $110. That's $22 tip.  To you cheapsakes out there! That's how you tip properly, so take a lesson. Our service was sublime nothing to really complain about, so to those people that find a problem every time. Get over yourself. Maybe the reason you have bad costumer service everywhere you go is because you're a bad customer. Lastly, to Nancy L. who said that the hostess greeted her without a smile. Get over yourself. not everything revolves around you. Let's change the way we treat the service industry.

548,Patric T.,"Westminster, CA",0,22,1.0,2.0,2014-07-09,"What a difference. Until today, this Cheesecake Factory location has been the ""go to"" restaurant whenever we have friends in town or just want an extraordinary meal and are willing to pay the high prices. I treated my wife to a birthday dinner and expected the same great-tasting food and attentive service as we've always enjoyed in the past. There seems to be a pall hovering over restaurants these days and the Cheesecake Factory seems to be its latest victim. We were seated soon and were led to a table whose waitress, at first, was attentive but then became less so as the meal went on. She pasted a phony smile on her face but she wasn't concerned much on getting our order or visiting our table during the meal. She ran through the ""specials"" as if she was giving a post-mortem account of how someone died. Asking for an additional round of bread was almost painful as, after I did, she gave me the look like, 'really'?  But what really caused us grief was the quality and condition of the food once if finally came. I don't mind waiting for hot and freshly cooked food, but when it comes out looking as if the chef's couldn't care less if it had any appeal, well, something's gone wrong. I ordered the Spicy Sesame Chicken and my wife, the Chicken Marsala. Let's start with mine. The chicken was cooked as I expected but, the brown rice was slathered in the sesame sauce, so much so that the rice was packed down and the sauce was floating in the dish. On the contrary, my wife's meal had little to almost no Marsala wine as part of the meal. She kept scraping the chicken on the dish hoping to gather some flavor. Our now largely missing-in-action waitress (she was not the euphemistic ""server"") came by only to re-fill our sodas and never inquired about our meal. Could I have spoken up? Of course and maybe I should have. I actually should have sent the food back and left. But we didn't want the reason we went there to be lost and we finished our meals. ""Did you leave room for dessert"" came the expected question from our waitress. ""No, sorry.""  Needless to say, her tip reflected not only her lousy service but the manner in which our food was prepared.

He said he would take care of it ""RIGHT AWAY"" but nothing yet. be aware of the grill master here Follow up 3 working days later no credit from this establishment. stop payment with my bank and mind you I called them back to ask about my credit and some ridiculous excuse about talk to the person in accounting. Why is this my responsibility and another Manager to even tell me this.

I notice this about a lot of food chain restaurants that are at first successful and then they become almost sluggish and careless. The food quality is not as great, and the service was almost nonexistent. But hey, people will still come to Cheesecake Factory no matter what, food is decent for price you pay for and it's a nice place to dine in without going anywhere too expensive. Now I never have a problem when I eat here, in fact the customer service is usually great the past couple times I've been here. I was here on Tuesday around 2-3pm (don't exactly remember the time). Me and my boyfriend decided to eat outside since it was pretty cold inside with the ac. Our server's name was Lori-Ellen. When she came to take our order she didn't even smile or greet us, she just asked us if we were ready to order. We got the Cajun Jambalaya pasta and fried calamari. What bothered me the most was when she came to bring us the food. She literally dropped off the plate on the corner of the table and left. Um hello?? It'd be nice if you left it in the center of the table for us to eat? Seriously..when she did that with the calamari and came back with the jambalaya, she did the same thing twice. Oh and the extra plates she brought us, the top one was dirty, I don't know why she thought we wouldn't notice that large stain on the dishes she handled us, but I guess she's TOO busy to check if they're clean before she gives them out. We actually told a different server who was working outside as well for a clean plate and she was a lot more friendlier. It was not even busy outside at all, it was just two other tables and us. She checked up on us once. Couldn't find her anywhere, we had to ask a busser for a different sauce for the calamari, he was really nice and helpful, brought it out quick. I wish I knew his name, I'm pretty sure he'd be a way better server than the one we had.  It took forever for her to come outside, we were waiting to ask for the check, ended up waiting for like 15-20mins. I don't know where she disappeared off to. She just seemed lazy about her job and didn't really care much about providing great customer service, please act like you like working there a bit more or don't even work there at all. She also seemed careless about taking the dirty plates off, I don't want to exaggerate and say she slammed the plates together, but it did seem kind of rude to make so much noise clearing plates off our table.I've been a server too so I know what looks acceptable and what doesn't as a server.

My friend was really embarrassed to have taken us here. She was expecting something else, having gone to another Cheesecake Factory with great service and quality of food, and we ended up with below subpar food here. We got hard bread that was unedible. My friend got undercooked pasta, oily cold onion rings (he sent them back, and they still came back oily and cold). This Cheesecake Factory location is not the best for having dinner for friends. Also the 5-star review about the jambalaya was a lie. The reason why I think he or she posted it was for reasons of cash or because they confused this location for another Cheesecake Factory. To be honest the pasta was undercooked and a meat my friend was chewing...it was the type of undercooked-stringy tendon bad. And it was a mix of undercooked and overcooked meats. The buffalo blasts were the only redeeming quality of the dinner and one of my friends felt bad for the waitress because while the service wasn't that bad, the waitress deserved better because she was friendly and sociable. My friend does not recommend the pastas. It's not terrible but it's, at the very least, edible. If you're expecting college student homemade quality food  flavors (and your chef is your best friend who you love and you know is sensitive about hard crits and blunt honesty) that lasts in your mouth and you're alright with that, it's not as bad. The quality of the food they put out is not reliable. For the price Cheesecake Factory offers, the entrees are not that hyped up. The cheesecakes are the best of their menu and in retrospect this makes sense. Also I ordered Mac n cheese and just putting this out there a restaurant with the word cheese in it should not be serving Mac and cheese that someone with a complete lack of cooking skills could outcook. I have literally made better Macaroni and cheese. The bread is hard as stone and we asked for candles repeatedly but we never got any. I will never come back here again. I couldn't finish my meal. My friend ordered strawberry lemonade and he got something completely different. Also I'm here on a Friday, where there isn't even a lot business and as a person who works I cannot fathom how anyone would spend their hard earned cash on a 7 dollar bowl of absolute bland pasta that you can make for 50cents and I'm definitely not paying for the terrible cooking skills of the ""chef"" in the kitchen.  To make matters worse, at the end even the pen malfunctioned when I was writing the check. AND AS THE BIGGEST, WORST PART OF THE EXPERIENCE...one of my friends got seriously ill. We were watching uncomfortably as she literally hightailed to the restroom and threw up, for the second time. In one friend's opinion, the chef employed is bringing the reputation of the brand down.

1668,Patric T.,"Westminster, United States",0,22,1.0,2.0,2014-09-07,"What a difference. Until today, this Cheesecake Factory location has been the ""go to"" restaurant whenever we have friends in town or just want an extraordinary meal and are willing to pay the high prices. I treated my wife to a birthday dinner and expected the same great-tasting food and attentive service as we've always enjoyed in the past. There seems to be a pall hovering over restaurants these days and the Cheesecake Factory seems to be its latest victim. We were seated soon and were led to a table whose waitress, at first, was attentive but then became less so as the meal went on. She pasted a phony smile on her face but she wasn't concerned much on getting our order or visiting our table during the meal. She ran through the ""specials"" as if she was giving a post-mortem account of how someone died. Asking for an additional round of bread was almost painful as, after I did, she gave me the look like, 'really'?  But what really caused us grief was the quality and condition of the food once if finally came. I don't mind waiting for hot and freshly cooked food, but when it comes out looking as if the chef's couldn't care less if it had any appeal, well, something's gone wrong. I ordered the Spicy Sesame Chicken and my wife, the Chicken Marsala. Let's start with mine. The chicken was cooked as I expected but, the brown rice was slathered in the sesame sauce, so much so that the rice was packed down and the sauce was floating in the dish. On the contrary, my wife's meal had little to almost no Marsala wine as part of the meal. She kept scraping the chicken on the dish hoping to gather some flavor. Our now largely missing-in-action waitress (she was not the euphemistic ""server"") came by only to re-fill our sodas and never inquired about our meal. Could I have spoken up? Of course and maybe I should have. I actually should have sent the food back and left. But we didn't want the reason we went there to be lost and we finished our meals. ""Did you leave room for dessert"" came the expected question from our waitress. ""No, sorry.""  Needless to say, her tip reflected not only her lousy service but the manner in which our food was prepared.

Not the case, We were very surprised to hear the call within just a few minutes.  We shared a huge salad that was really great, then I had a Mushroom/Swiss Cheese Burger and my lady had a pasta/chicken dinner- both were really excellent. We had told our server that we were celebrating our birthdays and she took good care of us.(sort of) At the end of our meal, our server asked us if we had room for a desert- we both sort of wondered if she had forgotten that we were doing the birthday thing- anyway, since we were in a desert style restaurant, we ordered the Blackout Cake to share- @ $7.95. It was really huge and very decadent-then moments after we got yhe cake-she brought is two little birthday sundaes with candles. So, what's the deal? Did she or the Cheesecake Factory take advantade of us? Her holding off on recognizing the occasion made uis awkwordly decide to add an additional $8 to our bill.

The medallions came out medium and therefore lost its juiciness. Mashed potato was on point -soft and buttery. Lastly, I had the garlic chicken noodle. Noodle was al dente so no issue there.

I mean congrats babe?  Anyways, after a quick 10 minute wait (Thursday night), we got our booth for 4.  The service here is always very nice, but also consistently slow.  For example, our water would always check in with us every time he walked by, but when we asked for more bread, it wasn't at our table for another 10 mintues.  I think the servers there are maybe a bit understaffed because they always seem to be rushing somewhere to help with another table.   Drinks: I'm the only table alcoholic, so I was the only one to order a drink.  I got a Hendricks Tonic w/ Lime and Cucumber and I gotta say they have pretty heavy pours here.  definitely not complaining though haha. Food: I'm actually not a really big fan of their food here.  We always seem to get calamari for the app and without fail, each time we order it, it gets smaller and smaller!  Last night's calamari was a plate with a napkin folded in half on it, with the actual calamari only put on top of that half napkin... it was honestly only good for 1 person's worth of food.  For entrees, my lady for some unbeknownst reason, swears by their chicken fettecini alfredo with sun dried tomatoes.  I guess she really loves bland sauce tossed with store bought (my guess) pasta and a couple of sun dried tomatoes thrown on top... but who knows?  maybe I'm the one with a terrible palate.  I ordered the chicken little - fried chicken breast strips with mash and veggies.  Let me clarify, this plate isn't bad, but also isn't great.  I only got it because I remembered it was huge - and this time was no exception.  After getting some sriracha (obviously), I devoured the plate and was definitely full. Dessert: Our awesome waiter came up to us towards the end of our meal and apologized for the slow service.  To make up for it, he actually threw in a free slice of cheesecake!  *CUE heavens opening up and harp music. We let him surprise us with his favorite underrated slice and a minute later he showed up with a S'Mores Cheesecake slice.  I was a bit skeptical, but after my first bite, SOLD!  The S'mores CC is amazing here.  It comes with a golden brown marhmellow melted over a rich creamy chocolate cheesecake, topped with whipped cream.  I don't think I wouldve been able to finish it by myself, so sharing was perfect for us 4.

266,Bud G.,"Long Beach, CA",0,102,,2.0,2014-10-12,"For me: 2 STARS For my eating companions (in their opinion, of course): 3-4 STARS Let me preface this specific review that I've NEVER had a Cheesecake Factory experience that made me want to go back. To me it's the ultimate in big, mediocre corporate food and my meals have always disappointed me in one way or another.  It may be my curse, because  it seems that other people I'm with (usually) have better experiences (and I understand why), but I seem to always come out going ""meh."" Maybe I just keep ordering the wrong thing, even though it's a different wrong thing each time. So, why do I keep going back?  Honestly, the only reason I show up to CF is because I have to: I'm with a group of friends and/or relatives and/or business acquaintances who want to eat there and I'm not in a position to argue the point. When it's someone's birthday and that's where they want to eat, you go with the flow, no matter how painful.  I'm giving it 2 STARS on today's visit for these reasons: The waiter, while friendly, was sparse in his attention. We had to flag down other waiters to get stuff or wait for a while to see him to flag him down.  The bread was OK, though I'm not a fan of the dark/squaw (or whatever it is) bread, and the sourdough was a bit on the tough side.  My dish was the White chicken chili.  Almost 14 bucks. The menu actually starts out with the description of this dish saying ""A generous bowl of..."" The waiter asks me if I want white rice or brown with that. I say brown, but it matters not, because the rice ended up being what amounted to a tablespoon in about a cup's worth of chili that barely took up the bottom third of this huge bowl that it was brought in. So, yeah, as the menu said, the bowl was indeed generous. However, the contents were not. Really, 14 bucks for this? The rest of my party either laughed or felt sorry for me when they saw that my dish was actually much smaller than the kid's meal that one of the kids in our party had. My partner actually called the waiter over and asked him if this was a mistake. He said no, that's the serving size and walked away.  OK, well, I'll just eat bread to fill up, I guess... As far as the chili itself, it was very, well, OK. Mediocre. Kind of watery, about a tablespoon of rice, a few pieces of chicken, a few beans and nothing about the flavor to distinguish it from, say, a mediocre chicken tortilla soup from a diner.  Anyway, the cheesecakes were OK, but cheesecake doesn't blow me away, so once again, another weak experience.

As I have worked in the restaurant industry for ten years (until last week :D ), I understand about sections closing, etc. However, what is the point of closing a desirable outside patio section at 9pm when you don't close the restaurant for another two hours and I could see several tables out there eating their dinners on the walk up. Be accommodating! That's your job. Besides, we would have tipped well. At the end of our meal, we had only eaten half of the food because it was a lot (we had each ordered combination plates). The server took it to box it up, and did not return for a while. When she did, it was to inform us that ""someone accidentally threw it away and the kitchen is cooking new food"" for us. No worries! We thought, well now we will have extra food, which is always cool. We got desert and eventually she delivered three boxes in a bag which was our replacement to go food.

I just don't understand why, after paying 90$ for our meal and tipping 20%, this was acceptable. I don't know if it was the servers memory, the kitchen manager being cheap, or just people not caring.  At any rate, we probably won't go back.

I would have liked a bit more rice and beans in the chili, but there was LOADS of chicken and it's very savory.  The Tuscan Chicken is served with balsamic vinegarette and has asparagus and grape tomatoes.aplenty.

We had told our server that we were celebrating our birthdays and she took good care of us.(sort of) At the end of our meal, our server asked us if we had room for a desert- we both sort of wondered if she had forgotten that we were doing the birthday thing- anyway, since we were in a desert style restaurant, we ordered the Blackout Cake to share- @ $7.95. It was really huge and very decadent-then moments after we got yhe cake-she brought is two little birthday sundaes with candles. So, what's the deal?

Not worth the $50 for food and two beers.  What also sucked is that they don't put a minimum temperature on the heaters for the outside heating.

1749,Bud G.,"Long Beach, United States",0,102,,2.0,2014-12-10,"For me: 2 STARS For my eating companions (in their opinion, of course): 3-4 STARS Let me preface this specific review that I've NEVER had a Cheesecake Factory experience that made me want to go back. To me it's the ultimate in big, mediocre corporate food and my meals have always disappointed me in one way or another.  It may be my curse, because  it seems that other people I'm with (usually) have better experiences (and I understand why), but I seem to always come out going ""meh."" Maybe I just keep ordering the wrong thing, even though it's a different wrong thing each time. So, why do I keep going back?  Honestly, the only reason I show up to CF is because I have to: I'm with a group of friends and/or relatives and/or business acquaintances who want to eat there and I'm not in a position to argue the point. When it's someone's birthday and that's where they want to eat, you go with the flow, no matter how painful.  I'm giving it 2 STARS on today's visit for these reasons: The waiter, while friendly, was sparse in his attention. We had to flag down other waiters to get stuff or wait for a while to see him to flag him down.  The bread was OK, though I'm not a fan of the dark/squaw (or whatever it is) bread, and the sourdough was a bit on the tough side.  My dish was the White chicken chili.  Almost 14 bucks. The menu actually starts out with the description of this dish saying ""A generous bowl of..."" The waiter asks me if I want white rice or brown with that. I say brown, but it matters not, because the rice ended up being what amounted to a tablespoon in about a cup's worth of chili that barely took up the bottom third of this huge bowl that it was brought in. So, yeah, as the menu said, the bowl was indeed generous. However, the contents were not. Really, 14 bucks for this? The rest of my party either laughed or felt sorry for me when they saw that my dish was actually much smaller than the kid's meal that one of the kids in our party had. My partner actually called the waiter over and asked him if this was a mistake. He said no, that's the serving size and walked away.  OK, well, I'll just eat bread to fill up, I guess... As far as the chili itself, it was very, well, OK. Mediocre. Kind of watery, about a tablespoon of rice, a few pieces of chicken, a few beans and nothing about the flavor to distinguish it from, say, a mediocre chicken tortilla soup from a diner.  Anyway, the cheesecakes were OK, but cheesecake doesn't blow me away, so once again, another weak experience.  However, I know, deep in my heart, that one day I'm going to have to come back here again, like it or not.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=560,3.32,3.02,3.24,2.6960000000000006,3.1400000000000006

I've been to the one in Brea and Anaheim but this was a first for the Huntington Beach location. Last weekend of 2014, we expected the wait to be longer than usual. Went inside to give the hostess our name and was given a wait time of 30 min. Not to bad after seeing the amount of people waiting inside. The computer system had just crashed so it was a bit chaotic. Hostesses and management walking around like chickens with their heads cutoff was entertaining to watch while we waited for our seats. After waiting 20 minutes, our names were called and we were seated in the patio. Large patio area seating with fountains, heat lamps and decor lighting. Beautiful sunny California weather and people watching with the only downfall, the restaurant is located right next to the freeway. I inhaled more carbon monoxide than fresh air. Sometimes you can't have it all. FOOD- The Cheesecake Factory has one of the most extensive menus and is not only limited to Cheesecakes.  - Small plates - Snacks - Appetizers - Salads - Pizza - Hamburgers - Sandwhiches - Pastas - Steaks, Chops, Fish & Seafood - Specialties - Sunday brunch With so many different entrees, it made choosing difficult. Luckily, I wasnt hungry so I took my time ordering. I even passed up on the free breadsticks. I decided to order the Bang Bang chicken with shrimp and babes choose the Rib eye steak with steamed broccoli. Bang Bang chicken with shrimp was a spicy Thai dish with curry, peanuts, chili and coconut served over brown rice. The perfect definiton of DELICIOUS! I love me some Thai but this by far takes the crown for best Thai curry dish. Ironically, I wasn't even dining at a Thai restaurant. I sampled the rib eye cooked to medium. It wasn't the best presentation but the flavor and tenderness made up for it.  DESSERT- Finished the meal off with Pineapple upside down cheesecake with a side of vanilla ice cream. It wasnt my first choice as they had ran out of the seasonal Pumpkin cheesecake with pecans. Sad. The cheesecake was a little too sweet and the combination of upside cake and cheesecake was a bit off. Next time I'll stick with the red velvet or the carrot cheesecakes. Can never go wrong with those two choices. SERVICE- Our waiter was friendly and provided us with good service. The only bad thing I could say is when I asked him what was good on the menu, his reply would be "" everything "". Even when it came to Cheesecakes he said "" everything was good "". Suggestions would have been helpful, although I probably wouldn't have taken them. Other than that, no complaints. PARKING-  Cheesecake Factory valet parking $5.00 and general parking is free. Finding close parking is always a hit or miss, but there plenty available parking spread across the shopping center and restaurants. OVERALL EXPERIENCE- Not the biggest fan of restaurant chains, but Cheesecake Factory is an exception. Great menu, delicious food and decent prices.

This past Friday night (01/16/15) my husband and I could not come to an agreement on what we wanted to eat.  He had a craving for Mexican and I have not craving at all.  I did have an anti-craving....I knew I didn't want Mexican.  So after much deliberation and whining (yes I sometimes whine all women do) my husband finally acquiesced to my Cheesecake Factory suggestion. We went around 6pm on a Friday night.....big mistake! Parking was impossible, after driving in circles for about 30min we finally found a spot (go after 8pm crowds and parking lighten up).  We then checked in and were quoted a 35-minute wait (not too bad but it was a crowed night).  We told the hostess we'd take the first available table and were subsequently seated outside.  Now I get cold in 70-degree weather and I was expecting to suffer in silence but they had over hanging heaters, which kept me nice and toasty.   We decided to start dinner with a round of libations.  My husband ordered the gin & tonic and I order the traditional Mojito.  I'm not a fan of gin but I tasted my husband's drink, it was palatable.  Though I'm sure part of the reason is because they are rather light handed with the liquor.   My mojito was nice too, not overly minty though it could have used just a bit more lemon.  I much prefer mojitos from Bar Celona in Pasadena...does that place still exist??)  But, still good flavoring and very refreshing.  We then moved on to around of appetizers.  I had the beets & goat cheese salad, and my husband went with the Ahi Tartare.  I can't really opine on the tartare because my husband mixed in some wasabi.  He put a piece on my salad plate without me noticing and thinking that it was a piece of beet I ate it.  Being that I hate wasabi and it was the only thing I could taste, I can't honestly give an opinion.  My husband liked it though.   As for the beet & goat cheese salad, I would have loved if it were a full dinner sized plate.  It was delicious!  The beets were sweet and did not have an overwhelmingly earthy taste.  They were firm but not hard and beautifully mixed in with the tanginess of the vinaigrette, which complimented the sweetness just perfectly.  The greens just like the beets were fresh, crisp and nicely tossed in the vinaigrette.  The chunks of glazed pecans and goat cheese were a nice extra but I noticed myself eating the beets and greens together separate from the cheese & nuts.  According to the menu the salad also had pieces of apples, which quite honestly I've no recollection of.  I must have been completely entranced by the beets.  For our main course my husband went with the chicken picatta and I decided to be bad and go with the Americana burger.  The picatta is one of my husband's favorite dishes and Cheesecake Factory has never disappointed, today was no exception.  It was creamy, tangy and ""capery"".  Only issue if you could call it that, was that he does not like angel hair pasta and ordered linguine instead.  He did not realize that all the creamy and saucy goodness was under the pasta....he figured it out soon enough.  The burger was good, cooked perfectly medium and tender.  The only things I did not enjoy which were the selling points; were the potato crisps and grilled onions.  Combined the potato crisps and the grilled onions overpowered all the other flavors.  I think I will stick with the regular burger next time.   To end the night no trip to the Cheesecake Factory is complete without having a piece of cheesecake of course.  I don't have a sweet tooth, have never been much a of dessert person, and am easily warded off by a lot of sugar.  So, we always stick with the ""regular"" cheesecake.  It had been years since I had a slice and goodness I'd forgotten what I was missing out on.  They seriously make the best cheesecake in the world (at least in my world).  It's cool but not cold or frozen, smooth but not runny or mushy and sweet but now drowning in sugar/sweetener.  Absolutely delicious!!!

We were seated all the way outside in the back that had NO LIGHTING except the little candle on the table... i needed to bring out my flash light on my phone to read the menu. 15 mins later we had to wave someone down to even get us drinks, and complimentary bread ( white, wheat served with butter) RECOMMENDATIONS: - pasta di vinci!! unique sauce with mushroom and chicken $17 - Chinese salad (HUGE portion side, share!)  $15 - appetizer- stuffed mushroom! filled with cheese inside.. yumm -Louisiana chicken   last but not least, the CHEEEESECAKE!!!! try them all! the slices are pretty big. ~$9 server- it was one thing we were seated all the way outside in the back (towards valet), but it was so difficult to find our server and she was not attentive.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=200,3.72,3.26,3.252,2.732,3.4440000000000004

I have been going here since they opened and the food was good for a while. We just went to eat here a couple nights ago and it was the worst food I have ever had here! I keep thinking maybe it's because we came early at 5 before the dinner rush but that's no excuse. The waiter was not friendly at all. The food was barely warm and did not taste good. And the cheesecake was not even good. I feel like they must have new cooks and staff. They are way overpriced and don't seem to care about the quality of the food or the waitstaff being friendly and accommodating. I got the chicken and biscuits and the biscuits were really small and burnt, the mashed potatoes were not creamy and not hot at all. The chicken was thin and salty. I had this dish a long time ago and the biscuits were huge fluffy and homemade. They looked like frozen biscuits and come on if you burn them cook more don't serve your customers burnt food when it's expensive. My husband got jambalaya and it was also barely warm. Seemed to me the dishes were left overs from lunch cooking. They didn't even try to heat up the food.  Very disappointed we will not be coming back to this location.

1163,Tiffany T.,"Long Beach, United States",10,10,26.0,2.0,2015-02-21,"A friend of mine talked up The Cheesecake Factory quite a bit. She frequents the Marina Del Rey location because she lives in L.A., but I'm in Long Beach closer to Orange County so I went to the location in Huntington Beach. Maybe this is the kind of chain where the quality fluctuates depending on the location but I was not impressed with the Huntington Beach location.  The restaurant is located in an outdoor shopping mall and it was a Saturday so of course parking sucked. They do have valet available for $5 which is a reasonable price, but I was with my sister and she refuses to pay for parking so we drove around until we found a space.  We arrived at about 3pm so there was no wait. When I first walked in I immediately thought of the theme restaurants in Vegas hotels. That isn't necessarily a bad thing although I'm not sure what theme The Cheesecake Factory is going for. The decor seems like they can't decide between Egyptian, Mayan, or Mardi Gras. It was a little disconcerting. The hostess was pleasant and the booth was spacious. Our waiter, Patrick, was also very nice, but one of the spoons in my sisters set up was dirty so we had to get a new one. It's worth mentioning, at least to me, that the booth lights look like the eye of Sauron, I kid you not!! I wish I'd taken a picture. My sister and I got full course meals, appetizers, entrée, and dessert. For appetizers we got the crab cake bites and the fried mac & cheese. I enjoyed my crab cake bites and I even liked the sauce that came with it. It was a tartar sauce with a hint of mustard. It sounds weird, but it was actually tasty. My sister didn't like her fried mac & cheese. I tasted it and it was ok, but not enjoyable. They do get points for giving her four good sized mac & cheese balls that can be easily shared between two or more people.  For entrées we ordered the margarita pizza and the chicken romano. My sister didn't like that they sprinkled Parmesan on the pizza. She said it was too salty. She also said she'd never had a margarita pizza without actual tomatoes. She said the pizza was edible but not good. I tasted it and agreed with her. My chicken romano was completely underwhelming. They put too much egg in the bread crumb coating to the point where that was all you could taste. Also, I understand that good pasta should be cooked al dente but my pasta was undercooked. It was also supposed to be tossed in a light tomato sauce but the sauce was heavy and full of Parmesan. I like Parmesan but they seem to put it in EVERYTHING.  We ordered cheesecake, the fresh strawberry for my sister and the key lime for me. They drowned both slices in whipped cream which wasn't necessary. The key lime was tangy and not too sweet like it should be, but for a place named The Cheesecake Factory, I didn't feel like it was a cheesecake I couldn't get at any other bakery/resturant like Polly's or Marie Calendars. My sister also felt that they went overboard with the glaze on the strawberries.  All of this amounted to an $85 dollar check which included an $11 cocktail. I probably should have been suspicious of the cocktails when I saw that there were no prices on the cocktail menu.  Overall verdict: underwhelming and over priced! As my sister said, you're basically paying for The Cheesecake Factory name, not for quality food. I must mention that the service we received was excellent which is the only reason this location gets two stars.

This location always seems to be buzzing with people no matter what time of day you go. Menu: the menu can be extremely confusing, with ads on some pages, long lists of food on others.

It is definitely a very hefty menu, almost 30 pages long!! and with the bad lighting, how can anyone really see?

Parking close will never happen, unless its your lucky day! So, save yourself the trouble and park far away and walk. I have been eating at Cheesecake factories in So Cal well before any Social media existed. I have been to this location in Huntington Beach  multiple times to celebrate Birthdays and just because type of meals for parties of 2-4 people. It has always been a go to place since its such a crowd pleaser. Buuuuuuuuut  each visit here in HB has always been a different experience. Some good, some not so good. A few times our order was mutilated, forgotten, or completely jacked up. Some visits our service were spot on and a perfect experience. I have eaten inside, outside and at the bar. In my opinion the bar is the fastest and easiest place to eat.  Today I felt service was decent, but rushed.  Service has never been consistent here,  which is why the 3 stars. Good servive to me, makes it or breaks it.  Service is really hit or miss depending on the time. The wait is anywhere from a few minutes to an hour. After placing your name, take the buzzer and wait. They seem to want to seat you, and quickly get your order in and send you on your way. I understand, they are busy and need to move the show along to serve people in a timely matter, but I ALWAYS feel rushed here. Helllllllooo....their menu is like a novel. I do require more than 5 minutes to know what I want.  Food is great here. I gravitate towards their salads that are way to big, burgers, Philly and the cashew chicken. All of them are great. Especially paired with the loaf bread they bring out. They have something for everyone here. I mean everyone from Carnivores to Vegetarians, that takes them on a trip around the world with their diverse cuisine. Their menu is endless. They even have skinny portions, just in case your counting calories. If your not counting calories their desert menu is amazing, offering any kind of cheesecake, some chocolate cake, ice cream, ect.  Drink wise, refillable Coke products, iced teas, strawberry lemonade are all perfect to wash down a delicious meal. If your into wine and bear they have that too. There is also Expresso drinks, which I am not a fan of. They are not as strong as I like them. Lunch for 4 was about $100.

My first time was years ago with my ex and I was young didn't know much about food. Came here 2 time with my bf and my taste bud has changed over the years. I DIDNT like what I ordered. I came here third times with my parents and my kid...my experience and taste bud still has not changed one bit. We waited over an hour for a frozen cheesecake, was not fresh when order so we cancelled.  Let's make the story short. I had GNO tonight and one of my girlfriend wants to come here because she craved for Hibachi steak. I have told them how I dislike this place and food are so terrible. They convinced me and I decided to give another try.  My experience tonight: order mojito during happy hour. The drink contains mild of alcohol and too much ice. (No wonder it's on happy hour menu)  Calamari: the only dish that we finished and taste good. The bad thing about this there were 2 popcorn chicken in our calamari. The manager came to our table informed us one of the plate gonna take another 10 minute because they have to change season. Told her there were chicken in our calamari, her respond? ""Oh, I'm sorry. Let me check in the kitchen and make sure it won't happen again.""

I expect a pretty good quality of food for the prices and location and was overwhelmingly surprised at how great everything was. Started with a super manly (sarcasm) Peach Bellini (sp?) and it was amazing. Very few places I have been can nail this fairly simple drink like they did. I ordered two more. I cannot remember the exact name of my dish but it was some sort of Steak Diane or something like that. It was the best steak and potatoes dish I have had so far in Huntington Beach. Absolutely amazing sauce with flawless sides as if the dish needed to be any more amazing. My cousin also got the Gumbo or jambalaya dish, and it was also amazing. Perfect amount of spicy while still being deliciously seasoned. I must say I am sad to hear that the Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake was taken off the menu.

I expect a pretty good quality of food for the prices and location and was overwhelmingly surprised at how great everything was. Started with a super manly (sarcasm) Peach Bellini (sp?) and it was amazing. Very few places I have been can nail this fairly simple drink like they did. I ordered two more. I cannot remember the exact name of my dish but it was some sort of Steak Diane or something like that. It was the best steak and potatoes dish I have had so far in Huntington Beach. Absolutely amazing sauce with flawless sides as if the dish needed to be any more amazing. My cousin also got the Gumbo or jambalaya dish, and it was also amazing. Perfect amount of spicy while still being deliciously seasoned. I must say I am sad to hear that the Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake was taken off the menu.

The second time, which was on a Thursday night, we only had to wait about 15 minutes. When we got seated, we found that it was very dim inside, so it was hard to see. It also took a long time for the food to come out. They basically have everything on their menu. They have a great selection of food -- burgers, pasta, salad, etc. Before we ordered, we got different types of bread and butter. The whole wheat bread is SO good. Their bread is unlimited too so you can ask them for more! When it was time to order, my boyfriend and I went for their pasta. He ordered the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic pasta and he loved it! I hate mushrooms but I also liked what I tasted of his pasta. It had a nice creamy flavor to it. His chicken was also tasty. I ordered the Spicy Chipotle chicken pasta and thought it was super delicious! It's now my favorite pasta -- it has the perfect hint of spice and the perfect crunch, since they top it off with bits of tortilla chips (I think).  Their cheesecake slice is really big...

I keep thinking maybe it's because we came early at 5 before the dinner rush but that's no excuse. The waiter was not friendly at all. The food was barely warm and did not taste good. And the cheesecake was not even good. I feel like they must have new cooks and staff. They are way overpriced and don't seem to care about the quality of the food or the waitstaff being friendly and accommodating. I got the chicken and biscuits and the biscuits were really small and burnt, the mashed potatoes were not creamy and not hot at all. The chicken was thin and salty. I had this dish a long time ago and the biscuits were huge fluffy and homemade. They looked like frozen biscuits and come on if you burn them cook more don't serve your customers burnt food when it's expensive. My husband got jambalaya and it was also barely warm.

The second time, which was on a Thursday night, we only had to wait about 15 minutes. When we got seated, we found that it was very dim inside, so it was hard to see. It also took a long time for the food to come out. They basically have everything on their menu. They have a great selection of food -- burgers, pasta, salad, etc. Before we ordered, we got different types of bread and butter. The whole wheat bread is SO good. Their bread is unlimited too so you can ask them for more! When it was time to order, my boyfriend and I went for their pasta. He ordered the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic pasta and he loved it! I hate mushrooms but I also liked what I tasted of his pasta. It had a nice creamy flavor to it. His chicken was also tasty. I ordered the Spicy Chipotle chicken pasta and thought it was super delicious! It's now my favorite pasta -- it has the perfect hint of spice and the perfect crunch, since they top it off with bits of tortilla chips (I think).  Their cheesecake slice is really big...

I went it a friend for lunch today and really wish we had picked somewhere else.  It took at least 15 minutes just for the server to come by to take our order, another 10 minutes to get straws, and our food didn't come out til about 30 minutes after that. By that time we had to get boxes and go because I had to go back to work. (I would understand if it were busy, but our server was slowly strolling around and talking to other servers about their dating lives and weekend plans, so I don't think he had too many tables at that point.) Not only that, but once I had the chance to open the box with the pizza in it and take a bite, I realized that the crust was so hard that I couldn't even bite through it. Now the pizza was cold which I expected, but it was hard as though it had been microwaved several times. If I had been eating this in the restaurant I would have sent it back.

Parking close will never happen, unless its your lucky day! So, save yourself the trouble and park far away and walk. I have been eating at Cheesecake factories in So Cal well before any Social media existed. I have been to this location in Huntington Beach  multiple times to celebrate Birthdays and just because type of meals for parties of 2-4 people. It has always been a go to place since its such a crowd pleaser. Buuuuuuuuut  each visit here in HB has always been a different experience. Some good, some not so good. A few times our order was mutilated, forgotten, or completely jacked up. Some visits our service were spot on and a perfect experience. I have eaten inside, outside and at the bar. In my opinion the bar is the fastest and easiest place to eat.  Today I felt service was decent, but rushed.  Service has never been consistent here,  which is why the 3 stars. Good servive to me, makes it or breaks it.  Service is really hit or miss depending on the time. The wait is anywhere from a few minutes to an hour. After placing your name, take the buzzer and wait. They seem to want to seat you, and quickly get your order in and send you on your way. I understand, they are busy and need to move the show along to serve people in a timely matter, but I ALWAYS feel rushed here. Helllllllooo....their menu is like a novel. I do require more than 5 minutes to know what I want.  Food is great here. I gravitate towards their salads that are way to big, burgers, Philly and the cashew chicken. All of them are great. Especially paired with the loaf bread they bring out. They have something for everyone here. I mean everyone from Carnivores to Vegetarians, that takes them on a trip around the world with their diverse cuisine. Their menu is endless. They even have skinny portions, just in case your counting calories. If your not counting calories their desert menu is amazing, offering any kind of cheesecake, some chocolate cake, ice cream, ect.  Drink wise, refillable Coke products, iced teas, strawberry lemonade are all perfect to wash down a delicious meal. If your into wine and bear they have that too. There is also Expresso drinks, which I am not a fan of. They are not as strong as I like them. Lunch for 4 was about $100. Luckily, Daddy BigBucks usually pays for us, especially since we were celebrating my Birthday today!!! 3 star service....4 star food.

My first time was years ago with my ex and I was young didn't know much about food. Came here 2 time with my bf and my taste bud has changed over the years. I DIDNT like what I ordered. I came here third times with my parents and my kid...my experience and taste bud still has not changed one bit. We waited over an hour for a frozen cheesecake, was not fresh when order so we cancelled.  Let's make the story short. I had GNO tonight and one of my girlfriend wants to come here because she craved for Hibachi steak. I have told them how I dislike this place and food are so terrible. They convinced me and I decided to give another try.  My experience tonight: order mojito during happy hour. The drink contains mild of alcohol and too much ice. (No wonder it's on happy hour menu)  Calamari: the only dish that we finished and taste good. The bad thing about this there were 2 popcorn chicken in our calamari. The manager came to our table informed us one of the plate gonna take another 10 minute because they have to change season. Told her there were chicken in our calamari, her respond? ""Oh, I'm sorry. Let me check in the kitchen and make sure it won't happen again.""  I order Diane steak, well done (can't stand pink...weh weh) first of all, most of my pieces are burnt, therefore, I cut off most of the layers. Mash potatoes cold outside but warm inside. Very odd...usually a well prepared food from a fine restaurant should be hot....not under room temperature to cold. Even my mushroom was cold, not warm but cold.

NOT TO MENTION WE WERE SEATED AT THE FIRST BOOTH THAT LEAD INTO THE KITCHEN!!! And the roach came directly from the kitchen! :-[.  I am so sad because I love cheese cake factory and their food is always so delicious! I felt it was important to report it to the manager, because that is a serious health issue. She told ME she would make an emergency call, but insisted that large cockroaches come from or side AND that the ones that you need to concern yourself with are the ones that are smaller. I told her, unfortunately this one was a smaller one and came directly out of the kitchen around the window that they have up on the booth. Our waiter even confirmed my fears and killed it for us!!!

My boyfriend and I just left this location at Bella terra food was great, we were paying and preparing to leave...AND THERE WAS A COCKROACH THAT SCURRIED ON THE HEAD REST OF OUR BOOTh. NOT TO MENTION WE WERE SEATED AT THE FIRST BOOTH THAT LEAD INTO THE KITCHEN!!! And the roach came directly from the kitchen! :-[.  I am so sad because I love cheese cake factory and their food is always so delicious! I felt it was important to report it to the manager, because that is a serious health issue. She told ME she would make an emergency call, but insisted that large cockroaches come from or side AND that the ones that you need to concern yourself with are the ones that are smaller. I told her, unfortunately this one was a smaller one and came directly out of the kitchen around the window that they have up on the booth. Our waiter even confirmed my fears and killed it for us!!!

It's not quiet and seating is close on long rows of table dining, but overall it's done well. We went last night (Saturday at 6pm) and I expected a wait. Surprisingly, we were seated right away (party of 4). That may speak to my report of of the food quality slipping. SERVICE (Rating 3.5) Our server last night was nice enough, helpful and knowledgeable about the menu, but he seemed to have a few too many tables as his attention span was short and visits infrequent.  SPICY CASHEW CHICKEN (Rating 3) This is my ""Go-To"" over the years. It's a spicy Mandarin-style dish with green onions and roasted cashews over rice. It typically is very good, but tonight.. not so much!. Very dry and the chicken quality and taste just so-so. I was disappointed. CAROLINA BBQ PORK SANDWICH (Rating 2.5) This sandwich sounded great, and it would have been if the meat was of better quality and not so tough. It said it was ""Tender"" pulled pork (barely could bite through it as it was so dry and overcooked). The applewood smoked bacon was good along with the coleslaw and grilled bun.

It's not quiet and seating is close on long rows of table dining, but overall it's done well. We went last night (Saturday at 6pm) and I expected a wait. Surprisingly, we were seated right away (party of 4). That may speak to my report of of the food quality slipping. SERVICE (Rating 3.5) Our server last night was nice enough, helpful and knowledgeable about the menu, but he seemed to have a few too many tables as his attention span was short and visits infrequent.  SPICY CASHEW CHICKEN (Rating 3) This is my ""Go-To"" over the years. It's a spicy Mandarin-style dish with green onions and roasted cashews over rice. It typically is very good, but tonight.. not so much!. Very dry and the chicken quality and taste just so-so. I was disappointed. CAROLINA BBQ PORK SANDWICH (Rating 2.5) This sandwich sounded great, and it would have been if the meat was of better quality and not so tough. It said it was ""Tender"" pulled pork (barely could bite through it as it was so dry and overcooked). The applewood smoked bacon was good along with the coleslaw and grilled bun. But without good quality meat, this sandwich served was an embarrassment for The Cheesecake Factory in my opinion.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=220,3.44,3.17,3.244,3.1160000000000005,3.278

So we decided to come for dinner. We ordered the egg roll sampler, my girlfriend ordered the lemon herb chicken and I ordered the Italian sandwich. The egg rolls pretty good although my favorite out of the platter would be the southwestern egg rolls (a must try). Our entrées came next. The sandwich was big and delicious I ordered it with a salad. But the salad seemed as if I was dressed early and sitting in a bowl. It was soggy and wilted when it came out to our table. The chicken was juicy and moist. But overly salty. We immediately told our server and sent her manager to our table with the complaint for her dish.

I don't know why but I was just shocked!*** I came down during the week on (Tuesday 3/29/16) and spoke to a really nice manager I told him that I had a 100 of my close friends coming to the movies - Superman vs Batman and afterwards we would be coming to his restaurant for dinner- his name is CHRIS WOOD he was very welcoming an had every intention to accommodate us!  When I arrived BEFORE the movie I confirmed again with CHRIS that 100 people will be coming directly after the movie and requested again the patio and he welcomed me with open arms ensuring me that he would stop seating in the patio around 7:00pm so as to get ready for our large party!  Everything went south when I arrived to see the patio still full of people and another manager by the name of ROB COWLE when he decided that he would NOT HONOR the agreement I had with Chris! He wouldn't even let me speak to him. He informed me that he made the final decision not to accomodate our group. I understand completely the policy that they don't take reservations but I came in early said I had 100 people for the patio...spoke with a manager...he verbally agreed. What else could I have done?  ROB COWLE did NOTHING to accommodate us....!!!  Rob Cowle needs to know that outright discrimation is not tolerated and hopefully the corporate office will do what they have to and get rid of people like that in their company.

1018,Selena P.,"Lynwood, CA",71,4,7.0,1.0,2016-04-03,Just so everyone knows personally I was really hurt because I have never felt the blatant discrimination I felt yesterday (Saturday 4/2/16) and I have worked with so many different people (different races) in my line of business over the years...and for this to be 2016! I don't know why but I was just shocked!*** I came down during the week on (Tuesday 3/29/16) and spoke to a really nice manager I told him that I had a 100 of my close friends coming to the movies - Superman vs Batman and afterwards we would be coming to his restaurant for dinner- his name is CHRIS WOOD he was very welcoming an had every intention to accommodate us!  When I arrived BEFORE the movie I confirmed again with CHRIS that 100 people will be coming directly after the movie and requested again the patio and he welcomed me with open arms ensuring me that he would stop seating in the patio around 7:00pm so as to get ready for our large party!  Everything went south when I arrived to see the patio still full of people and another manager by the name of ROB COWLE when he decided that he would NOT HONOR the agreement I had with Chris! He wouldn't even let me speak to him. He informed me that he made the final decision not to accomodate our group. I understand completely the policy that they don't take reservations but I came in early said I had 100 people for the patio...spoke with a manager...he verbally agreed. What else could I have done?  ROB COWLE did NOTHING to accommodate us....!!!  Rob Cowle needs to know that outright discrimation is not tolerated and hopefully the corporate office will do what they have to and get rid of people like that in their company. It was just so wrong...I will NEVER come there again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=280,3.52,3.3,3.332,2.116,3.3880000000000003

Please see below for my review and complaint that I left on the Cheesecake Factory's website! Shame on you Rob Cowle!! On Saturday April 2nd, after about 2 months of planning, my family attended a Group movie night with about 120 of friends and family and children from our Christian congregation. My dear friend Selena P. is an event planner in the Los Angeles area who frequently organizes weddings and other events. She is absolutely professional and meticulous in everything that she does. Prior to the event she let us know that she had made arrangements for us to have dinner together after the movies at your restaurant. I personally love Cheesecake Factory and was thrilled to hear that we would all have dinner together there. Unfortunately, when our large party arrived after the movies we were told that the manager onsite ROB COWLE would not honor the arrangements that our event planner had made with CHRIS WOOD. He was extremely rude to her while she tried to explain to him the prior arrangement. He would not even allow her to speak to Chris Wood who had been so kind in previously setting up the arrangement. As our large party (over 100 patrons) waited out front she tried to reasons with Mr. Cowle to accommodate us. He refused to do so or offer any other suggestion. He did not even apologize for not honoring her reservations. Selena did everything right. She visited the restaurant earlier in the week. She even provided pictures of the space days earlier after confirming with management. I arrived early to the theater and personally witnessed her go to your restaurant to reconfirm the reservation hours before our expected arrival time. I am the last one to ever complain about racism. However, I have never seen someone treated with such blatant disrespect. I could not help but ask myself whether or not the fact that we were predominantly African-American in a predominantly Caucasian neighborhood had anything to do with the way Mr. Cowle was treating us. I have never been treated so horribly in my life, especially not by an establishment based in customer service. To see my friend brought to tears broke my heart and I am appalled at the way she was spoken to and treated. I can assure you that all of the other food establishments in the Bella Terra mall were thrilled that your company turned us away because we visited about 3 other restaurants who treated us with the respect that our patronage deserved. The only color that should have mattered in this situation was green. At least human decency and an apology were owed but Mr. Cowle had none of those for us. If Cheesecake Factory is in the habit of mistreating groups of paying customers then it is no longer a place that I care to visit!! Another Cheesecake Factory has opened in Santa Monica near my job and I have already vetoed anyone from my pharmaceutical company to have lunch or dinner meetings there.

1148,zheng y.,"Los Angeles, United States",1,136,4.0,1.0,2016-04-25,"Had two bad experiences here over the past month.  A friend and I live about 50 miles apart, so it is convenient to meet in the middle at Bella Terra. We tire of the noise at Islands and the menu at Romano's, so we tried Cheesecake Factory for variety. Two weeks ago, I ordered salmon rolls, and our male server, whose name I don't recall entered the order as shrimp rolls. Not being familiar with the CF menu, I began eating the rolls, only to find no salmon inside. Waiter was called, and he apologized and re-entered the correct order. By the time the salmon rolls came, my friend had finished his lunch, so the mis-order and poor timing made our lunch very unsatisfying. They made no effort to offer us any sort of compensation for the error, and we didn't ask, so we just chalked one up to poor service and bad attitude. This weekend, my friend, who enjoys CF more than I, suggested it again and I acceded. We got there at opening at 11, so it wasn't too busy yet. I ordered an omelette which was to include avocado, cheese and bacon. When the food came out, I began eating, and once again, after 4 of 5 minutes and a half dozen bites into the omelette, I realized no avocado had been included, called our server Marisa over, and returned it for correction. After a normal wait, the correct plate was served, but once again the timing of our meals was disrupted and Marisa was not genuinely a good server, not very attentive, and offered no form of compensation for the kitchen's error. In light of two similar experiences, with in one case a server's error and in one a kitchen error, I can only assume management does not encourage the servers to offer any discounts or desserts to compensate for such terrible service.

The egg rolls pretty good although my favorite out of the platter would be the southwestern egg rolls (a must try). Our entrées came next. The sandwich was big and delicious I ordered it with a salad. But the salad seemed as if I was dressed early and sitting in a bowl. It was soggy and wilted when it came out to our table. The chicken was juicy and moist. But overly salty. We immediately told our server and sent her manager to our table with the complaint for her dish.

The manager felt so bad, he comped our dinner and also treated us to a piece of cheesecake. Both the waiter and the manager came to our table to apologize again and again, and to tell us how badly they felt, and that they take these matters seriously.

1370,Tonia B.,"Anaheim, United States",387,15,,2.0,2017-01-02,"I, normally, never write Yelp reviews, but the service I received today was inadequate enough for me to take the time to share my experience.  First off, I have work experience in the food industry. Therefore, I have an understanding of what it is like to deal with complicated customers or even just trying to get through a tedious shift on a bad day. I have been to this location recently in December and received the same subpar service but not enough to the point of publication. The repeat of a bad experience, regardless of whoever served me, had already set a mood.  My party of four was seated quickly. Alexandria, our waiter, promptly addressed the menu and was attentive to us from the very beginning, until we were waiting fifteen minutes for her to put in our order. She was stationed in an area that had about five distinct parties of three or less; therefore, a small wait was understandable. However, what we did not appreciate was the fact that we were waiting while she was chatting with another coworker at the register. It was not until I flagged her down as she was, again, passing her booth, that we finally put in our orders. She was very nice about accommodating to our orders, giving us advice about customizing our entrees, and suggesting me a dish that fit my preferences that was not my initial choice. So, we waited and noticed that the food was taking a while to come out. Thirty minutes had passed and the first dish came out. Just one. Normally, when only one dish comes out, other dishes follow right after, but we were left waiting another 10-15 minutes for two more dishes. At this point, we were agitated because we were hungry, like all humans. What was interesting was that another server came by to tell us that the last dish had been sitting on the counter for some time and got cold; therefore, they had to toss it up again for it to be warm. The very first dish had to be taken back to warm up as well. My dish was not the dish I had originally decided on with her upon ordering. The last dish was the only dish that did not have complications to it. When we received our bill, one dish was charged as a dinner entree when we had all said lunch sized portions. Though it could have been a misunderstanding, I thought it was a bit peculiar that one person out of a party of four who came during lunch special hours would order a dinner entree. I think she should have clarified our orders before giving them to the kitchen for the sake of that mistake.  Alexandria addressed our problems professionally and still maintained a level head despite the tension and frustration that came with the miscommunication. Mistakes are okay; they are what makes us human. However, when mistakes are being repeated and unattended to, they become problems and that was the case here.  Please consider being more organized or stationing employees better throughout the vicinity to ensure that each customer gets the undivided attention that comes with having exemplary customer service.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=120,2.84,3.38,3.372,2.7920000000000007,3.164

We were greeted by a very cocky server and he stayed that way for the entire meal.  I don't know what we did wrong except maybe for the fact that we were Asian?  I just felt He was prejudiced because he seemed better at the other tables. Me, my wife, my 14yr son and 12yr son all felt the same about his attitude so it had to be him right?  And we don't normally complain about bad services but today we left this establishment with a very sour feeling.   And yeah my son didn't want any cheesecakes for dessert either.  He asked if he can get dessert somewhere else and wanted to leave as quickly as possible. Will never comeback to this establishment again.  Even the food seemed very off today too.  How can it be godd when you have a sour mouth.

It did not taste dirty and I could not tell if there was any alcohol in it. I didn't even catch a buzz. I don't know what it was but it seemed more like cold slightly sweet and salty water. During our 2 hours there our sections waiters switched out 3 times and our serves were never the same. We ordered a couple appetizers and entrees. The appetizers were fried and hard to mess up. They came out hot. My wife ordered chicken and biscuits, I ordered steak Diane. Her chicken and biscuits looked like it sat under a heat lamp all day. It was tuff, rubbery, the biscuits were tough and sad looking. She could've got better chicken and biscuits at Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC). My Steak Diane did not look like Steak Diane. I called the waiter over and asked what it was. He said it was Hibachi Steak but it was missing the onions, bean sprouts, pesto and tempura asparagus... WTF! We go out to eat as a treat.

It was not until I flagged her down as she was, again, passing her booth, that we finally put in our orders. She was very nice about accommodating to our orders, giving us advice about customizing our entrees, and suggesting me a dish that fit my preferences that was not my initial choice. So, we waited and noticed that the food was taking a while to come out. Thirty minutes had passed and the first dish came out. Just one. Normally, when only one dish comes out, other dishes follow right after, but we were left waiting another 10-15 minutes for two more dishes. At this point, we were agitated because we were hungry, like all humans. What was interesting was that another server came by to tell us that the last dish had been sitting on the counter for some time and got cold; therefore, they had to toss it up again for it to be warm. The very first dish had to be taken back to warm up as well. My dish was not the dish I had originally decided on with her upon ordering. The last dish was the only dish that did not have complications to it. When we received our bill, one dish was charged as a dinner entree when we had all said lunch sized portions. Though it could have been a misunderstanding, I thought it was a bit peculiar that one person out of a party of four who came during lunch special hours would order a dinner entree. I think she should have clarified our orders before giving them to the kitchen for the sake of that mistake.  Alexandria addressed our problems professionally and still maintained a level head despite the tension and frustration that came with the miscommunication. Mistakes are okay; they are what makes us human. However, when mistakes are being repeated and unattended to, they become problems and that was the case here.  Please consider being more organized or stationing employees better throughout the vicinity to ensure that each customer gets the undivided attention that comes with having exemplary customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=120,3.2,3.33,3.356,2.152,3.278

When Bridgette L finally came over she told me that she had just heard about out service failure. That wasn't true.

I recommend the chicken sliders as they come with deep fried chicken breast that has a slight pepper/paprika flavor and is very tasty! The breast was dry but the thousand island, pickles and tomato made up for it.

This time they came through with flying colors. Despite being slammed and busy my wife and I got seated in 15 mins on a Friday night in OC which anyone will tell you is no mean feat. I ordered the factory make your own omelette with bacon, ham, cheddar and Jack cheese. I thought I would order something a little different and I got fries instead of the potatoes but I ordered a side of syrup. Our waitress came through and my fries where amazing. The omelette was equally amazing. I got a piece of lemon meringue cheesecake to go.

I received the food without any napkins or silverware, which was unexpected but obviously I could fix that problem.

629,Dagmar A.,"Huntington Beach, United States",53,76,14.0,2.0,2017-04-11,"After tonight's experience, I felt compelled to update my previous review.  I ordered a Super Antioxidant Salad to go (along with a side of mac n cheese) and the salad was quite the flop.  The menu lists avocados, blueberries, grapes, seeds, etc. to be a part of the salad.  Well, I had four tiny squares of avocado in the entire salad, ZERO blueberries, a total of four grapes (cut in half), and the portion size of the salad overall was SO MINUSCULE (not at all a generous Cheesecake Factory portion by any measure)!!  For $12, it was absolutely small.  Additionally, I requested beets on my salad--I even told the order taker on the phone that I would pay for them as an added side, but no matter what, I wanted (roasted) beets for that salad.  That request, I should mention, took forever, as I got put on hold two times just to secure this request.  When I came in to pick up this to-go order, I specifically opened by bag to check for the beets, and when I did not see them, I asked the checker at the register--she assured me up and down that they were in there (I think she was staring at the pears that came with the salad) and I was trying to tell her that I didn't see them, so she called the kitchen (or so she said) and they allegedly told her that the beets were there.  So what was I supposed to do at that point?  I said,  ""okay, maybe I'm just blind because this place is so dimly lit that I guess the dark beets are mixed in there with the greens and I'm just not seeing them.""  BUTTTTT, no such luck.  I get home, sort through the thin layer of salad that was supposed to be my full entree-sized salad, and found ZERO beets.  Colossal fail tonight Cheesecake Factory--I could go on with the errors, but I'm tired of writing.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=80,3.04,2.89,3.296,2.088,2.95

Me, my wife, my 14yr son and 12yr son all felt the same about his attitude so it had to be him right?  And we don't normally complain about bad services but today we left this establishment with a very sour feeling.   And yeah my son didn't want any cheesecakes for dessert either.  He asked if he can get dessert somewhere else and wanted to leave as quickly as possible.

We ordered a couple drinks. I ordered a Kettle One Dirty Martini. This is my go to drink because I always order it and know what it tastes like. It did not taste dirty and I could not tell if there was any alcohol in it. I didn't even catch a buzz. I don't know what it was but it seemed more like cold slightly sweet and salty water. During our 2 hours there our sections waiters switched out 3 times and our serves were never the same. We ordered a couple appetizers and entrees. The appetizers were fried and hard to mess up. They came out hot. My wife ordered chicken and biscuits, I ordered steak Diane. Her chicken and biscuits looked like it sat under a heat lamp all day. It was tuff, rubbery, the biscuits were tough and sad looking. She could've got better chicken and biscuits at Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC). My Steak Diane did not look like Steak Diane. I called the waiter over and asked what it was. He said it was Hibachi Steak but it was missing the onions, bean sprouts, pesto and tempura asparagus... WTF! We go out to eat as a treat. When we go out to eat we expect food that is much better than we can make it. In the amount of time it took them to bring us terrible food I could've made the same food... only a 100 times better.

Our waitress was good about doing separate checks in the groups we asked.  Sometimes wait staff gets annoyed by that, but in my opinion its a lot easier when more than one person has to pay for a check.  Less aggravation in the end, in my opinion. I ordered a water, and noticed my straw had lipstick on it.  Or something, that looked like lipstick.  They come in the drinks, not in a wrapper.  Totally grossed me out, and I asked for an entirely  new water. I ordered the Orange Chicken.  I havent been to a Cheesecake Factory in a long time... and couldnt remember if I liked the Orange Chicken.  It was between that and fish tacos.  When my dish came, I asked for an extra side of the sauce for the chicken.  It wasnt dry tasting, it just didnt have much sauce on it, and I wanted more, for flavor and to add it with my rice as well. The service was good, always had full drinks, and our waitress was friendly and consistent. Not in the area often, but I would return here.

1417,Jr W.,"Orange, United States",0,3,,1.0,2017-06-26,"On June 23rd my family & myself decided to dine at one of your restaurant chains in Huntington beach because my girlfriend had received a gift card from one of her cousins a couple weeks prior as a birthday present because her cousin knows we tend to come dine at some of your restaurant locations at least a couple times a month because my family admires the great quality of food & service we always receive but sadly this was not one of those days. We can most of the time estimate how soon our appetizers & meals would come out especially if it's a packed house or not & we can understand when it's busy. But at 9pm to 11pm is not your peak hour on busyness tonight. Waiting over an hour for a Louisiana chicken pasta, bacon cheeseburger, kids quesadilla & chicken Madeira should not take that long to prepare. After paying for the bill I went up to the hostess desk to ask to speak the manager. Finally the manager who presented himself as Joe which Nicholas (the busboy) told me that was the manager he had told that i wanted to speak to him during our meal but never came after being told twice.

I then asked Joe why he never came by our table after being asked twice by Nicholas & he told me after the first time I asked to speak to him that he went up to our waitress Jenna & asked what I wanted to speak to him about but he said Jenna told him that we were just waiting on our food & wondering when it was coming out.

937,Jr W.,"Orange, CA",0,3,,1.0,2017-06-26,"On June 23rd my family & myself decided to dine at one of your restaurant chains in Huntington beach because my girlfriend had received a gift card from one of her cousins a couple weeks prior as a birthday present because her cousin knows we tend to come dine at some of your restaurant locations at least a couple times a month because my family admires the great quality of food & service we always receive but sadly this was not one of those days. We can most of the time estimate how soon our appetizers & meals would come out especially if it's a packed house or not & we can understand when it's busy. But at 9pm to 11pm is not your peak hour on busyness tonight. Waiting over an hour for a Louisiana chicken pasta, bacon cheeseburger, kids quesadilla & chicken Madeira should not take that long to prepare. After paying for the bill I went up to the hostess desk to ask to speak the manager. Finally the manager who presented himself as Joe which Nicholas (the busboy) told me that was the manager he had told that i wanted to speak to him during our meal but never came after being told twice. I proceeded to let the manager know where I was sitting in the restaurant & that I seen him talking to the table next to us informing them of what I over heard him tell them apologizing on the food taking so long & he confirmed what I heard was true & that he said that.

About 15 minutes later our food arrived. I looked at my plate and couldn't believe what I saw. There was a lunch size portion of food on the plate. They wanted$17.95 for it. My wife looked at it and said the same thing. Definitely not worth $17.95.  I asked a server to get the manager. I explained the situation and he offered to either replace it with something else or he could have more pasta added to it. I opted fomore pasta. When the plate returned it had twice as much as it had before. Good manager, great dish. Excellent blend of pasta, marinara, shrimp and sausage. I would order it again, except with a lot of pasta. The turkey on my wife's sand was very salty and the onion soup, with a chunk of bread(?) in the bowl, left a lot to be desired. Good luck on your next Cheesecake Factory.

I anticipated that it wouldn't be AS good as at the restaurant but it was a pretty bad experience. I received the food without any napkins or silverware, which was unexpected but obviously I could fix that problem. The steak was cooked properly and had good flavor but there wasn't any tempura asparagus, which was really disappointing. There was a very small amount of sprouts and the other vegetables to top it all off, next time I want to eat at home I will be sure to go somewhere else.

Our waitress was good about doing separate checks in the groups we asked.  Sometimes wait staff gets annoyed by that, but in my opinion its a lot easier when more than one person has to pay for a check.  Less aggravation in the end, in my opinion. I ordered a water, and noticed my straw had lipstick on it.  Or something, that looked like lipstick.  They come in the drinks, not in a wrapper.  Totally grossed me out, and I asked for an entirely  new water. I ordered the Orange Chicken.  I havent been to a Cheesecake Factory in a long time... and couldnt remember if I liked the Orange Chicken.  It was between that and fish tacos.  When my dish came, I asked for an extra side of the sauce for the chicken.  It wasnt dry tasting, it just didnt have much sauce on it, and I wanted more, for flavor and to add it with my rice as well. The service was good, always had full drinks, and our waitress was friendly and consistent. Not in the area often, but I would return here.

818,Jennifer T.,"Westminster, CA",47,16,119.0,4.0,2017-07-25,"Cheesecake Factory is a very affordable, high quality restaurant. Food + Service = :) INSIDE: The restaurant allows you to choose to sit inside and outside. I have sat at both during dinner hours. If you are seated outside, it is a very calm and relaxing area even if there are cars around. Not loud at all, and they put out fire stand thingys (what are the called omg??) when it gets cold. Inside, you'll sit at a table or booth. Very clean and spacious.  SERVICE: Each time I go, servers will usually leave their shift and another server will substitute in. I love how nice and informative they are when they switch off their shifts. I get to meet my new server and things go on as if it didn't happen. One thing I love about this restaurant is how it ALWAYS refills my water even if I've sipped on it twice. It's the little things that matter. During all my visits at Cheesecake Factory, I have only gotten my order wrong once. My waiter will correct it, and my replacement comes about 5-10 minutes later which is fine with me. (I had ordered the Skinnylicious Salmon Rolls, but I received some Skinnylicious salmon dish).  THE FOOD: I love the menu selection at Cheesecake Factory. It includes anything you can think of. I love their fries and will order it despite what kind of dish I'm ordering! However, I docked one star off this review because their Cuban Sandwich. This sandwich came off as very, very greasy. It tasted pretty bad, and I felt like it was something made to be microwaved and was heated with a grill instead. It was a mess eating it. I love all the pastas here, but just that sandwich makes me feel a little sick.

1058,Jennifer T.,"Westminster, United States",47,16,119.0,4.0,2017-07-25,"Cheesecake Factory is a very affordable, high quality restaurant. Food + Service = :) INSIDE: The restaurant allows you to choose to sit inside and outside. I have sat at both during dinner hours. If you are seated outside, it is a very calm and relaxing area even if there are cars around. Not loud at all, and they put out fire stand thingys (what are the called omg??) when it gets cold. Inside, you'll sit at a table or booth. Very clean and spacious.  SERVICE: Each time I go, servers will usually leave their shift and another server will substitute in. I love how nice and informative they are when they switch off their shifts. I get to meet my new server and things go on as if it didn't happen. One thing I love about this restaurant is how it ALWAYS refills my water even if I've sipped on it twice. It's the little things that matter. During all my visits at Cheesecake Factory, I have only gotten my order wrong once. My waiter will correct it, and my replacement comes about 5-10 minutes later which is fine with me. (I had ordered the Skinnylicious Salmon Rolls, but I received some Skinnylicious salmon dish).  THE FOOD: I love the menu selection at Cheesecake Factory. It includes anything you can think of. I love their fries and will order it despite what kind of dish I'm ordering! However, I docked one star off this review because their Cuban Sandwich. This sandwich came off as very, very greasy. It tasted pretty bad, and I felt like it was something made to be microwaved and was heated with a grill instead. It was a mess eating it. I love all the pastas here, but just that sandwich makes me feel a little sick.

FOOD My girlfriend and I shared the Jambalaya and it was pretty good.  The chicken was seasons well.  My girlfriends parents had the Grilled Fresh Salmon with a side of Shrimp and the Seared Ahi Tuna with a side of shrimp.   They both enjoyed their meals especially the shrimp.  However, the sides weren't the best.  We did not have cheesecake for desert, we were full.  Overall the food was decent for what it was and although the rest of the experience was not good, we give the food 3/4 of a star.  ALCOHOL I had a Whiskey Smash and my girlfriend had a Well Mannered Martini.  My Whisky Smash was a tad sweet but over all really good.  They pour generously here so that is a plus.  The Well Mannered Martini was good and you couldn't taste the blue cheese olives in the drink.  Overall the drinks are 3/4 of a star.  CLEANLINESS & AMBIANCE  The restaurant and bathroom are relatively clean for the foot traffic Cheesecake Factory has which tends to be a lot on a Saturday.  The ambiance is also a little loud for my taste but it is a chain and that is part of the experience.  Overall the cleanliness & ambiance gets one star.  SERVICE The service was horrific.  Our waiter Nathan G did not seem like he wanted to serve the table at all.  When he did come to the table to take the orders and my girlfriend was translating what she was ordering for her parents he got annoyed because they changed their minds one time.  Also he never let us know how late the appetizer was going to be.  It eventually came out after the meals so we sent it back.  Finally he didn't come by once to ask how we were or if we wanted desert.  We have had a string of good service so we were due, but this was bad.  Overall the service deserves zero stars a complete disappointment.  VALUE/PRICE The restaurant is a good value we spent $111 on three meals and three drinks without tip.  Obviously the tip was not very good on this night.   Overall the value/price receives 3/4 of a star.  In conclusion the restaurant is 3.25 stars.  I really wanted to give it closer to 2 stars but it did check off the necessary boxes I suppose.  I definitely won't be back for a meal here again unless someone specifically requests it for a birthday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=40,3.2,2.77,2.916,2.572,2.942

This place closes at 12:00 pm...We all know the cheesecake here is to die for but I have to tell you the filet minion steak here is simply the best in Orange Country! They tell me most folks don't order it and order mosly pasta dishes at this restaurant but if you are like me and need a perfect steak now and again oder this baby! It's very large...thick..and juicy! It comes with mashed patatos and veggie. I ask them to add mushroom gravy to the mashed and it is yummy!

I decided to try this one because it looked really nice from the outside, so I wanted to give it a go.  We began by ordering something from a temporary/new menu, $5 'Nashville Hot' Chicken Nuggets. These were surprisingly good and probably the highlight of our dinner. The chicken was perfectly cooked and very tender. The sauce was spicy and really good. I also think it was a generous sized portion for $5. It went really well with the sauce. I liked it!

These were surprisingly good and probably the highlight of our dinner. The chicken was perfectly cooked and very tender. The sauce was spicy and really good. I also think it was a generous sized portion for $5. It went really well with the sauce. I liked it!

Then, we waited for over 15 minutes to order our entrees. The food finally came and I had to get up from the table again to get a napkin. We needed to order additional drinks and couldn't find our server again so we asked to see the manager. We asked our server 3 times for the manager. It took the manager, Bridgette L, over 45 minutes to come to our table. The server told me that he asked her 3 times to come to our table. When Bridgette L finally came over she told me that she had just heard about out service failure. That wasn't true. Based on Bridgette L's response, it speaks volumes about how they really feel about the customer. They don't care. I live in the same complex as ""The Cheesecake Factory"", Bella Terra. There are plenty of restaurants to visit and we won't be back. Our friends from Germany asked if this is the type of service they should expect from American Restaurants. I told them this was the worst service I've received in the last 30 years. I eat out 5 times per week for lunch and eat out 3 or 4 times per week for dinner.

I've been going here since it first opened and it's consistently busy but the wait is usually manageable. I highly recommend the happy hour at the bar from 4 - 6 p.m, as the appetizers are $5.95 and they have drink specials as well. Came here yesterday and met up with my sister for happy hour at the bar. We were able to find a seat easily and our bartender was very attentive and took our order right away. We ordered the avocado egg rolls, chicken sliders and regular beef sliders and couldn't finish it all. I recommend the chicken sliders as they come with deep fried chicken breast that has a slight pepper/paprika flavor and is very tasty! The breast was dry but the thousand island, pickles and tomato made up for it. Still a great and classy place to get a drink and a meal for cheaper than the Disneyland Resort prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach,2.64,2.8,2.796,2.48,2.736
789,Dagmar A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",53,76,14.0,2.0,2017-11-04,"After tonight's experience, I felt compelled to update my previous review.  I ordered a Super Antioxidant Salad to go (along with a side of mac n cheese) and the salad was quite the flop.  The menu lists avocados, blueberries, grapes, seeds, etc. to be a part of the salad.  Well, I had four tiny squares of avocado in the entire salad, ZERO blueberries, a total of four grapes (cut in half), and the portion size of the salad overall was SO MINUSCULE (not at all a generous Cheesecake Factory portion by any measure)!!  For $12, it was absolutely small.  Additionally, I requested beets on my salad--I even told the order taker on the phone that I would pay for them as an added side, but no matter what, I wanted (roasted) beets for that salad.  That request, I should mention, took forever, as I got put on hold two times just to secure this request.  When I came in to pick up this to-go order, I specifically opened by bag to check for the beets, and when I did not see them, I asked the checker at the register--she assured me up and down that they were in there (I think she was staring at the pears that came with the salad) and I was trying to tell her that I didn't see them, so she called the kitchen (or so she said) and they allegedly told her that the beets were there.  So what was I supposed to do at that point?  I said,  ""okay, maybe I'm just blind because this place is so dimly lit that I guess the dark beets are mixed in there with the greens and I'm just not seeing them.""  BUTTTTT, no such luck.  I get home, sort through the thin layer of salad that was supposed to be my full entree-sized salad, and found ZERO beets.  Colossal fail tonight Cheesecake Factory--I could go on with the errors, but I'm tired of writing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=80,2.68,2.77,2.8,2.3120000000000003,2.734

1052,Marwan K.,"Costa Mesa, United States",42,44,142.0,3.0,2017-11-08,"My girlfriend and I have decided to review restaurants based on five criteria: Food, Alcohol, Cleanliness & Ambiance, Service and Value/Price We came to Cheesecake Factory at Bella Terra for my girlfriend's dad's birthday.  FOOD My girlfriend and I shared the Jambalaya and it was pretty good.  The chicken was seasons well.  My girlfriends parents had the Grilled Fresh Salmon with a side of Shrimp and the Seared Ahi Tuna with a side of shrimp.   They both enjoyed their meals especially the shrimp.  However, the sides weren't the best.  We did not have cheesecake for desert, we were full.  Overall the food was decent for what it was and although the rest of the experience was not good, we give the food 3/4 of a star.  ALCOHOL I had a Whiskey Smash and my girlfriend had a Well Mannered Martini.  My Whisky Smash was a tad sweet but over all really good.  They pour generously here so that is a plus.  The Well Mannered Martini was good and you couldn't taste the blue cheese olives in the drink.  Overall the drinks are 3/4 of a star.  CLEANLINESS & AMBIANCE  The restaurant and bathroom are relatively clean for the foot traffic Cheesecake Factory has which tends to be a lot on a Saturday.  The ambiance is also a little loud for my taste but it is a chain and that is part of the experience.  Overall the cleanliness & ambiance gets one star.  SERVICE The service was horrific.  Our waiter Nathan G did not seem like he wanted to serve the table at all.  When he did come to the table to take the orders and my girlfriend was translating what she was ordering for her parents he got annoyed because they changed their minds one time.  Also he never let us know how late the appetizer was going to be.  It eventually came out after the meals so we sent it back.  Finally he didn't come by once to ask how we were or if we wanted desert.  We have had a string of good service so we were due, but this was bad.  Overall the service deserves zero stars a complete disappointment.  VALUE/PRICE The restaurant is a good value we spent $111 on three meals and three drinks without tip.  Obviously the tip was not very good on this night.   Overall the value/price receives 3/4 of a star.  In conclusion the restaurant is 3.25 stars.  I really wanted to give it closer to 2 stars but it did check off the necessary boxes I suppose.  I definitely won't be back for a meal here again unless someone specifically requests it for a birthday.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=40,2.88,2.88,2.8,2.508,2.88

She literally sighed out loud, made a rude face, grabbed our menus and my drink forcefully and says ""well where do you guys wanna sit? Because it's going to be a while"" and doesn't wait for an answer and storms to the front. We follow her and I grab my drink from her and tell her I can hold it myself. She was so unbelievably rude for nothing!!!! We simply asked if we can sit at another table. My husband asked for her name and she said Halley. Still in awe for how she treated us when we KINDLY asked her for another table. We eventually got sat at a great location with a great server and enjoyed our food..except for the dirty silverware that was at our table when they first sat us. Servers/bussers should check the utensils before setting up the tables. Probably won't come here again!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=20,2.6,2.68,2.74,,2.648

Not only did he recommend the greatest thing on the menu, but his service is impeccable. If they gave out awards for being the most charismatic and helpful server in the industry, Austin would definitely win it. Somebody give him a tall glass of fine whiskey and a real Cuban cigar because he's 2018s server of the year! Thanks again Austin, that steak was so good it could cure cancer and save impoverished countries.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach,2.72,2.71,2.752,,2.7140000000000004
