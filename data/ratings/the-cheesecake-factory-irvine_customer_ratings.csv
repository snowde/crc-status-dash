The dim lighting, the decorative walls, and the colors makes me feel any meal here is a celebration. We finally visited for Sunday brunch. Although we arrived soon after opening, I was disappointed that we passed several bright-and-open window tables; we were, instead, seated at one of the 2 dull booths with a view of the door leading to the restroom (my error; I should've made my request earlier). As if our seating location wasn't enough of a disappoitment, the table exuded a rank smell of stale sponge/rag -- so unpleasant. I've detected that disagreeable smell at some fast-food counters, but didn't expect it here. Thankfully, the seating location and the smell was eased by the fact that we had a very sweet and pleasant server; in addition, the food was delightful, attractive, and generous (no room for dessert this visit). Next time, I'm hoping they'll have replaced (or at least washed) their cleaning rags, and I'm requesting a different section",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=520,3.04,3.1,3.1,3.088,3.0760000000000005
385,Al S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1253,506,242.0,5.0,2012-02-14,"Five Stars? For what...? Well, I guess I've always dodged ""bad experience bullets"" when stopping at Cheesecake Factory restaurants. I've visited a large number across the Western US, and frankly, have never had anything less than good service and good food. And that would be the worst that has happened. Usually whatever I order is just plain ""really good."" I'm rarely if ever disappointed. If there were an award for consistency in customer service, and dependable quality across the menu, then this restaurant group deserves my 5-stars. I can't think of another chain doing as good a job.  I took my wife and two of our grand-girls to the Spectrum CF for an early Valentine's Day dinner. As usual, the visit included great customer service, from the hostesses to the wait staff. And tonight, Ryan, our server, was at the top of his CF customer-service-game. We were never without bread and drink refills, and the guy was just one of the nicest servers we've had while at any restaurant. It seems I've lucked out, because this is pretty much what I get at every location I visit.  When my wife and I travel together, and we want a late lunch or dinner with no surprises, we'll look for a Cheesecake Factory location. I've found every location amazingly consistent in both service level and food prep and quality. And as for the Spectrum location... it's one of our reliable favorites. The only ""OK"" visit I can remember was at the Tyler Mall, Riverside store, and then it was a worn out server that I remember, not a food issue. And even then I remember her covering all the bases, but obviously at the end of her shift, tired and distracted. She didn't take it out on us, she just didn't have the spunkiness we're used to. So if that's the worst I can remember, I'd say that's a good thing. While I can understand and empathize with anyone who's had a bad experience at a CF location, including this one, I tend to think it's an anomoly. It just doesn't happen that often, and when it does, I'll bet a call to the location's manager will produce both a sincere apology and a complimentary dinner, or at minimum, fair compensation for whatever may have happened.  Our corporation has sold to some of the chain and franchise food groups here in the US, and in my ""black book and private list"" of best operations..... CKE (Carl's Jr. and Hardy's), and Cheesecake Factory are at the top of my list. My recommendation for a ""Table for Two?"" Try ordering the Chicken Madera and the full size Santa Fe Salad. Ask for two extra plates, and split both items. It makes for a great ""salad-entree"" combo, and I assure you, there will be more than enough food. The chicken is served with two chicken breast filets and plenty of mashed potatoes. And the salad? Well, it's probably enough for three to four guests!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=580,3.04,3.11,3.11,3.188,3.082
421,Jennifer L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",145,177,145.0,2.0,2012-02-23,"So I am generally not a fan of chains, however, I am simply writing this review because the Manager here is absolutely positively the nicest woman I have ever met.  She is accommodating and even with our bad experience here she really did make our night better.  I feel terrible for losing her card but in case anyone from the restaurant is reading this she has brown hair, is caucasian, and really nice! (idk if that helps much but I tried!)  She really does deserve a raise.   Now, on to the next note.  Their waiting staff is not a very bright bunch.  They are slow, don't check up on you very often, and seem to have a common trait of forgetting various parts of your order.  I have been here probably 5 times in the past 4 months and 5 out of those 5 times I have had something wrong with my order.  There has been hair in my food, plates coming in extremely cold, and appetizers completely forgotten. The most recent time I came here we didn't even receive our food for 45 minutes to an hour because they had forgotten to place our orders!!!  It's a wonder that our waiter didn't even say anything to us, I personally think she forgot we were a a part of her section!

The servers were nice and really attentive. We got the Firecracker Salmon ($11) as an appetizer and it was AMAZING. The sauce is so good!! I only wish they would make it into an entree, instead of having it be an appetizer with a measly four pieces!  I always order the Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon (lunch portion is $13, dinner is $16) for my entree. I tell myself I'll order something else the next time I come, but I can't seem to stray from it! I guess I just love me some salmon. :) The Frozen Iced Mango is also really good. At $6, it's a little overpriced but I think it deserves a try.

453,Michelle H.,"Irvine, CA",218,395,47.0,3.0,2012-02-23,"I was here for lunch with my fiance and it was filled with families doing the same thing.  Like any true OC resident, I've been here a million times and I knew that we would go and probably nosh on a tasty salad and burger.  What I did not anticipate was the SCREAMING table of children on either side of me.  Now let's get one thing straight, I realize that kids are tough to deal with.... But to let your kids take complete control of the dining table and aisle ways is completely ridiculous.   When we asked our waitress if we could be moved, she went to the server station but came back with a no go since the wait had been so long for ANY tables in the restaraunt (1 HOUR!).  She offered us an outside table, but it was a little too chilly for my taste.  We stayed inside and the waitress tried to keep us comfortable by keeping service quick and making sure our drinks were consistently filled so we could get outta there ASAP.   I ordered a BBQ chicken salad and my fiance and a the pulled pork sandwich.  As usual, Cheesecake delivered with tasty food.  The BBQ chicken salad is always pretty perfect and my fiance's pulled pork sandwich was good, but I think he wished he had ordered a burger instead since the pulled pork was DOUSED in BBQ sauce and a little to goopy for his taste.   We opted to skip dessert because both screaming tables of children had gone from bad to worse.   Pros: -Good Food  -Large Portions -Nice Servers Cons: -LOUD... LOUD... LOUUUUDD! -Long waits for tables -Food/Drinks are pricy for such a large chain",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=640,3.0,3.11,3.11,3.0200000000000005,3.066
745,Brandon N.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",7,22,1.0,4.0,2012-02-27,"Okay, I've heard some people talk about cheesecake factory complaining how it's expensive, and really, if you're going to come to a place like this, you shouldn't expect to be spending only five dollars. You get what you pay for, and for the price, you get some pretty nice quality food here.  Onto the food. I've been here with my girlfriend, and we get the Firecracker Salmon appetizer, which is pretty gosh darn good. I usually skimp on appetizers because I feel like, for the price, it's not worth it. (10 dollars an appetizer, 13 an entree, might as well get the entree right?) but this was a pretty nice exception. It was pretty great! Although the measly four pieces left much to be desired, and I craved more. The bread that they give as an appetizer is also pretty great. I love their honey wheat bread, with a light bit of butter in between, and even though I normally hate sourdough, it was pretty good here too.  As far as entree's are concerned, we ordered two entrees, the salmon filet and the jambalaya. We tried sharing to finish but frankly, two entrees is a HUGE amount of food. (Part of why you should expect that you're paying a lot). So we had planned to get cheesecake too, but honestly, we just had no room.  The cheesecake here is phenomenal though. I've tried the classic, the strawberry, the kahlua, and the red velvet. All of which are smooth and creamy and sweet. The perfect little dessert to cap off a great dinner. All in all, this place would make a great little lunch place or a fantastic dinner restaurant. The bill might be high in the end, but what do you expect?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=740,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.152,3.1200000000000006

475,Brad T.,"Lake Forest, CA",111,190,14.0,4.0,2012-03-07,"I'm with Al S., as far as his opinion on this Cheesecake Factory location.  I've been here numerous times and the food and service are always superb.  Food always comes out hot and fresh, and servers are always attentive.  The menu is extensive, with plenty of comfort food.  They now have nutritional information on the tables too... or if your table doesn't have a pamphlet, you can request one.  I usually order comfort food here, so accordingly, here are my favorite items: 1) Factory meatloaf - try mixing the meatloaf with the mashed potatoes on your fork at the same time - wow! 2) Salisbury steak - I know it's a retro-type food, but I got it for the first time last time I was here and it's pretty damn good - similar to the meatloaf, but smaller 3) Chicken and biscuits - grilled chicken along with mashed potatoes and gravy, and biscuits.  Calorie overload, so take some home - or get the gravy on the side 4) Shepard's Pie - more meat and potatoes... All of the small bite appetizers we've tried are good too - and always brought out quickly.  For cocktails, try their manhattan - assuming you like bourbon.  Some places you can wait 10+ minutes to get your drink... not so at the Cheesecake Factory.  I won't go into detail on dessert choices... they aren't called the Cheesecake Factory for nothing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=600,3.16,3.13,3.13,3.184,3.142

The bread was great, as usual - but that's where the pleasantries ended.  We waited a solid 25 minutes before we even got our menus. There was nobody checking up on the tables on this side of the restaurant, apparently.  Before we ordered, we instructed the waiter that we wanted separate checks for every party member. Of course, when the check came at the very end (after waiting 30 minutes for him to come, no less) it was NOT separated as we had asked. Big oversights and mismanagement bar-side were really disappointing, especially after the great experience we had two weeks ago with Patrick (in the regular dining section).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=580,3.32,3.14,3.14,3.0520000000000005,3.2120000000000006
166,Rohlin A.,"Mission Viejo, CA",169,802,3662.0,4.0,2012-04-11,"I have been to this Cheesecake Factory several times over the years and it is one of the most consistent restaurants I have visited. The most recent visit was after we left another restaurant and we were much happier with the food here.  We waited about 5 minutes to be seated outside and our drink orders were taken.  Our server brought the drinks back, some bread and took our orders.  The Strawberry Lemonade is very good and they have an excellent ratio of flavoriing to lemonade. We ordered an appetizer of Buffalo Blasts, the wife ordered the Chargrilled Coulotte Steak and I ordered the Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club. The bread was warm and there is a sourdough and grain bread.  The appetizer came a short time later and was outstanding.  Buffalo Blasts are like deep fried wontons filled with chicken breast and bleu cheese dressing and buffalo sauce for dipping.  It is also a huge portion, 8 large wontons which we came no where near finishing. Our dinner came a short time later and my wife's steak was okay.  It was a little over cooked and looked a little tough to me.  The mashed potatoes were okay as well, but my wife is not a fan of red potatoes.  I loved my club, it had plenty of shrimp and bacon in it and again was a huge portion. For dessert, we shared the cheesecake on special, the Hershey Chocolate Bar Cheesecake with Creamy Chocolate Frosting and Chocolate Chips. A quarter from the sale of each slice will be donated to Feeding America, the nation's leading domestic hunger relief charity.  Talk about chocolate overload! Finally, our server Morgan was very friendly and engaging.  She checked on us several times and spent time to talk to us during the meal, even though her tables were busy.  We would probably come here more often, but Chief isn't allowed in the outside eating area, so this limits our visits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=440,3.32,3.14,3.14,3.088,3.2120000000000006
218,Laina A.,"Mission Viejo, CA",486,696,935.0,4.0,2012-04-12,"As my fellow yelpers Rohlin A., Al S. and Randoll C. say I've always had very good experiences at Cheesecake Factory, so lucky me! This is a popular place so there can be a wait.  I recommend going in a half an hour early and put your name in, then you can cruise the Spectrum and get extra hungry.  You're going to need to be.  The Cheesecake Factory has a huge menu and the portions are huge.  There is a little bit of this, a little bit of that, and just perusing the menu can take some time.  I love the chicken littles and the bbq ranch chicken salad and the navajo (a chicken sandwich).   Once you're order is taken, your drinks arrive, along with a bread basket with real butter.  The breads are sourdough and a type of squaw.  Both are always warm and tasty and you can always get more.  I do wish the butter wasn't so hard, but here is a tip:  it's in wrapped pats and you gently squeeze the sides and the warmth of your hands translates to the butter and it softens, so you are able to open it and spread on your warm bread. Sunday brunch, how about lemon ricotta pancakes or sunrise fiesta burrito? The appetizers, small plates and snacks are pages and you can order 3 or 4 of those and split it all and get to taste test a lot of different items.  I really like the buffalo blasts. Did I mention dessert?  Cheesecake galore.  Pretty much if you can dream it, it's there.  We split and tried the Hershey chocolate bar cheesecake and it was divine, although the chocolate infusion was on overload, so you really need to love chocolate!  Not a problem, I do!  25 cents of each slice of this cheesecake is donated to Feeding America, so you're doing good deeds too!  Does it get better than eating good and doing good?  Nope. Warning, you need to like leftovers!  The Cheesecake Factory has huge portions and taking home food is just part of the experience.  Certain items, think salad, really do not survive the transition well.  Luckily, you can get a cheaper lunch size portion of salads, and a few other items.  Did I mention that even the lunch size portion is big?  It is!  No salad in/on some small bowl/plate.  You will still have plenty to eat. I've found staff to usually be helpful and friendly and management wants to please.  Any time I've had an issue, it's been addressed and fixed.  I love the decor of Cheesecake Factory.  Brighter color swirls and modern fixtures.  I personally do not like the booths, as they backs are almost completely straight up, not the most comfy in my opinion, so I usually opt for a chair.

It's always been a place where we stopped to eat after shopping and ogle at the rows of cheesecake and deciding before we even order our entrees what kind of cheesecake we are going to get.

I don't blame them at times though, as it's always busy and I can't imagine waiting on so many different people at all times. One of the things I frequently get here are the pizzas. It's made for 1, but CF standards, it's at least 2. Lucky for me, I love leftover pizza! Also, I love dipping it in their ranch sauce. One of the best I've had.

The ambiance at this restaurant is pleasant and I'd recommend dining off of peak hours.   Head in on a weekday for dinner or lunch and things are a little less rowdy, and you get to appreciate the place a little more.  If you go on a weekend for dinner expect there to be huge crowds in the waiting area, lots of noise,  and a long wait---usually an hour plus.   As far as the seating itself goes I prefer the high tables in the bar area.  They are first come-first serve and this space feels more open than the regular dining area.  If you like eating outdoors they have a patio which is nice as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=780,3.32,3.21,3.21,3.248,3.254

I've been coming here since I was a kid, but stopped coming at one point. Now, I'm back here all the time. The best part about this place is how extensive their menu is. It's pretty easy to find something for everyone. My two favorite dishes, as of late, have been the Pasta Da Vinci and the Sausage Ricotta Flatbread. I think I've ordered that pasta dish EVERY SINGLE TIME for the last five or six times; it hasn't gotten old. The flavors are so amazing; the sauce is a little on the sweeter side, which isn't usually something that I like, but something about this pasta is just bomb. Plus, the portobello mushrooms really add something to it. What's great about the Sausage Ricotta Flatbread is that it's on their new Skinnylicious menu. I think it's only $5.95 and under 490 calories!!!  Cheap and healthy, not to mention delicious.  We always get a slice of cheesecake after the meal too. The last one we tried was the Pina Colada as well as the Banana Cream. I don't really think you can go wrong with any of the flavors. They're all superb.

However, the steak that Nam ordered looked like something you would've seen served in a hospital cafeteria. It came on a small plain white dish in a pool of its juices, about half the size of the pasta plates, with a small bowl of fries on the side. Restaurants should know that customers eat with their eyes first, and this did not look appetizing at all. Especially at $26 a plate. I could've made this at home! The steak itself is a no frills type steak. No sauce, no garnish, just a slab of steak. Taste-wise it was about as plain as it looked.

Had dinner there on a Tuesday night (2/12) @ 7pm. Our service was TERRIBLE! The worst service I have ever received at Cheesecake Factory. I've been to CF many times in various locations throughout CA, this being my 1st time at the Irvine Spectrum and was very disappointed. I had high expectations, especially since the location was in such a nice area, many business professionals there and because typically they have good food and service. Our server took almost 25 min to take our order. We were not offered ANY refills on our beverages and worst of all, we only ordered 2 small appetizer salads and the small macaroni appetizer! Food took forever to get and when we did get it, the macaroni was cold! Perhaps the server had a bad day, but that is no exception to give such awful customer service. We were shocked that service was so bad and with no reason, especially because it was a Tuesday night! The place was not packed at all. When we got our bill, she never came by to collect it, so we stood up and had to look and wait around for a manager. When we complained to the manager (a younger lady) she didn't do anything abut it! She just said, ""Oh, I'm sorry about that."" UNBELIEVABLE! She didn't offer to comp our meal which was not even close to a $30 tab or offer us anything for the HORRIBLE and INEXCUSABLE service. I will never go back to this location again, and I'd rather go the other nearby restaurants to give my business to.

We were quickly seated and given a basket of their bread. My gf loves he brown wheat bread, while I like their regular french bread.  Our waitress was Megan and he was very friendly. We ordered the Avocado Eggrolls as our appetizer. I got the Mushroom Burger and my gf got the Garlic Noodles. Avocado Eggrolls 3 large avocado stuffed egg rolls, cut in half and served with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. These were very good. I usually do not care much for avocados, but these were very refreshing. Pretty filling though. After were split these and had some bread, we weren't that hungry anymore. Mushroom Burger Nice huge burger with caramelized onions and sauteed mushrooms. I enjoyed the nice toasted bun and the meat was nicely cooked. The onions were very sweet and the swiss cheese was very nice. The mushrooms were a little thick for me and had a little too much mushroomy flavor that I personally do not like that much. Overall a nice burger for mushroom lovers. Garlic Noodles My gf always gets these noodles as they are her favorite. It is a simple clean noodle with a light sauce. The actually didnt finish much of it this time as we were stuffed from the eggrolls. I am very happy with their service. We asked to get the garlic noodles boxed up while we paid the bill and by the time we paid and were ready to go, we forgot we had the noodles boxed up. We left for about 10 minutes by the time we realized we forgot the noodles. Basically the entire dish was left and we paid for it, so we were hoping they didnt throw it away.

337,Christine W.,"Corona, CA",51,13,1.0,1.0,2013-03-21,"So the last time I gave a restaurant a bad review, I got a waitress fired...but because what I said prompted the owner to look into the waitress' service which ultimately led to his disapproval of her behavior. However, she wasn't going down without a fight so she ended up harassing me on yelp but the owner apologized to me and she eventually stopped. So, fingers crossed that it doesn't happen here.  I don't know if it's just the specific waiter that I had or perhaps the waiters mentally checked out because my bf and I went late, but the service was terrible. Firstly, I wanted to point out that for some reason, we got sat in the very back. I saw some empty tables on my way allllll the way to the back. I don't remember the waiter's name because he didn't care to get our attention or greet us when he came to our table. Every time that we interacted with him, I could tell he didn't give a flip what we had to say and he would walk away abruptly after we'd asked for something. And of course, no smiles. I get that it's no Nick and Stef's or Ruth's Chris but does it hurt to smile? The nice lady at the $5 ramen place near my house that I go to gives better service than this. I have nothing against cheesecake factorys. In fact, it used to be my favorite restaurant growing up. However, I have to comment on the fact that this particular Cheesecake just didn't have the same friendliness. At another Cheesecake, when I asked if I could take the delicious brown bread we all love home, the waitress boxed it up for me and gave me an extra fresh one still warm. This guy over here tin foiled my half brown bread along with the white bread, and threw it in our to-go bag.  Sigh, it was just disappointing to not be given good service. It was a special day for me! I know that I can't judge because it's just one server but don't you think they should make sure that every server gives excellent service to every customer? It's important to remember that every customer counts and that every customer has family and friends and could be a potential regular. Oh, and the food was really greasy. Or at least the pasta was. Don't order a pasta dish unless you're splurging. In which case, I ordered the farfalle, which was not bad.

One caveat:  the appetizers are KILLER.  Next time that's all I'm eating. The Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes are so yummy that I could eat them every day for a month.  They melt in your mouth and the mixture of flavors is just simply heavenly.  We also had the crab and artichoke dip but it was waaay too fatty creamy.  Tasted good though, served with little pieces of toasted crispy bread. For the main course, Diane had the Cobb Salad.  It was your typical Cobb salad, with the chicken, avo, egg, greens, etc.  She liked it, nothing to write home about.  I ordered the Taco Salad. When it arrived I sat and looked at it.  Then I picked at it a little to see what was under the top lettuce. Not much.  Then I called the server and sent it back and ordered Chicken Marsala. Problem is, what I meant to order was Chicken Madeira, the best selling dish at CCF.  The chicken marsala was much less satisfying and I left most of it.  It was just the chicken on a bed of bow tie pasta.  But it was m,y fault that I ordered the wrong thing so I just contented myself with one piece of chicken (3 pieces of boneless skinless in all), and a big piece of cheesecake! We both got the Original Cheesecake.  I'm always hoping for cheesecake like I used to eat at the old Stage Deli in New York, had been going there since I was a kid until they closed.  But nothing compares.  The Original Cheesecake used to be really good:  a solid cheesecake with a big layer of sour cream on the top.  The inside part is now too mooshy, and the layer of sour cream is miniscule.  And the graham cracker crust doesn't taste as good either.

A couple of minutes later the restaurant manager came by with a rather patronizing smile on his face and said sorry about that would you like another artichoke I'll remove this one from your bill.  No apologies, no embarrassment, no what can I do to turn this into a better evening for you, just that smile like it was really funny.  I said no to the artichoke and he was gone.

Adding up to all of these qualities includes The Cheesecake Factory, an American eatery. With close to one hundred and seventy locations in America, The Cheesecake Factory is a must go to restaurant. Many of the customers range from casual get togethers with friends to fancy dinner dates or celebrations. The brown decor on the inside adds a modern vibe to the hip bistro. With an affordable price range leading anywhere from $12 to $20, this place is always packed with people.  Being a no brainer, The Cheesecake Factory is most known for its signature cheesecake. Cheesecake flavors range from a tropical piña colada to a rich dark chocolate. Where most dessert menus list about five different options, the menu for cheesecake at this bistro includes around fifty different flavors of their rich and creamy cake. All in all, when you take a bite of the cheesecake, the creamy texture and rich flavors keep you coming back for more! Where dessert is the most popular dish on the menu, the appetizers are great for large parties. Appetizers set the mood for a restaurant leading the customer onto how the quality of the rest of their meal will be. The appetizer menu at The Cheesecake restaurant is filled with many delicious samplers. Fried Calamari is one of the most popular appetizers at many different restaurants, but once you get the calamari at The Cheesecake Factory you will never want to get it anywhere else! The savory calamari is lightly crisped giving it a wonderful texture, and to create a bursting of flavors in your mouth, it comes with a tangy garlic sauce. Another great appetizer is the Tex Mex Eggrolls. Being Hispanic, no Mexican dish compares to mother's cooking, yet this appetizer is absolutely to die for. The savory yet spicy chicken with cheese, beans, corn, and peppers go great with their avocado cream and salsa creating its own sensual party of the taste buds.  The Cheesecake Factory also has an enormous menu of delicious entrees. With large competitions from reigning pizzerias, The Cheesecake Factory puts up a good fight with their cheesy goodness. Consisting of dough, sauce, and cheese, this amazing bistro goes above and beyond when creating their pizza. When anyone can create a simple pizza pie, The Cheesecake Factory bakes them to utter perfection. Personally I would say that their Margherita pizza is their best including the fresh tomato and delicious basil baking until the flavors mold into each other making an aroma to for sure salivate your mouth. This restaurant deserves the gold medal for not only cheesecake but their amazing entrees too! This amazing restaurant is a favorite of mine that I would no doubt recommend. If your planning on a nice date or a casual get together this is the perfect bistro. All in all, the cheesecake makes the restaurant famous, but the food in general is adored across the nation. Therefore, the next time you come across The Cheesecake Factory don't mind dropping by, even if its just for dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=840,3.32,3.35,3.248,3.3800000000000003,3.338

The Grilled Artichokes are delicous, and melt in your mouth. The only gripe I have is when water is ordered always be sure to offer a straw. Not just here but many places I go I have to request a straw a minimum of 2 times prior to actully getting it. Why would you deliver coke and tea with sraws but not water.

Don't look at the nutritional content because it will make you cry. When it comes to cheesecake, I think some of their options are a little over the top.

A few months back we went to the MV location and they tried to seat us at a dirty table then realizing this moved us to another one once we were seated I looked at our silver wear and noticed green stuff in my fork wile my lady noticed lipstick still on her glass we were just over it and grossed out with how dirty it was so we walked out. The management ended up mailing us a gift card to come back because my lady complained to them hence why we went here for Halloween. Once seated it took quite a wile for them to ask us for drinks and even longer to get the drinks (Alcoholic and waters) once we finally got them my lady's water glass was half full when the server put it on the table kinda strange but okay the daiquiri I ordered wasn't bad but it definitely tasted virgin. For some reason they said they were out of bread and making more a good amount of time went by and once we got bread it wasn't fresh it was kinda cold definitely were lied to about that. About 45min or so passed from when we ordered food to when got it thats a really long time for pasta when its uncrowded. Both of our dishes were tasty and hot I just wish I could have ordered another drink our server never came back to check on us or to get us more drinks or even fill our water for that matter.

According to my friend, this place gets crazy packed starting at lunchtime.  I was a little appalled to realize that they actually had to ask us if we wanted their bread. I thought every Cheesecake Factory brings some out unconditionally. Anyway I had the skinnylicious chicken sandwich which has less than 590 calories with some salad on the plate. My friend had the blueberry pancakes and his son had the kids pancakes with some fruits. The blueberry pancakes came out as two large pieces with blueberries inside and an extra three on top.

As I've said before, I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but my boyfriend got a giftcard for Christmas so we decided to take a night off from cooking and grab dinner here.  Despite the epic length of their menu, there was nothing I was dying to try, only options I was willing to eat.  My boyfriend and I each ordered a glass of wine and I ordered the Cajun chicken littles (essentially breaded chicken fingers with mashed potatoes and succotash) and he ordered the Bellagio Chicken (I think that's what it was called) on the server's recommendation.  While my meal was fine, there was absolutely nothing Cajun about the chicken fingers - the breading was absolutely bland and I would have killed from some tapito or sirracha or something.  Happily, my boyfriend really enjoyed his meal.  The bill for this relatively simple meal came to $50.17 which I consider pricey for a chain given what we orderd, but the portions were absolutely gargantuan.  We both could have easily been full (despite being starving when we sat down) just sharing one entree, but we weren't familiar with the restaurant so we ordered two. While the service was good and the meal was fine, I don't think we'll hurry back.  I'd prefer to go to a non-chain that serves better meals with more reasonable portions for the same money or less.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=660,3.56,3.4,3.28,2.636,3.4640000000000004

There was mixture of chocolate chips inside the cookie dough filling that made it taste absolutely balanced. The crust was made out of a thin layer of dark/milk chocolate and it added an extra kick of chocolate. The whipped creamed was also sprinkled with chocolate chips. This is probably one of my favorite cheesecakes I have tried at the Cheesecake Factory. Highly recommend to anyone who loves a chocolate chips cookies and cheesecake. It's a perfect combination.

My husband and I decided to grab lunch here today as we normally do on the weekends. Today wasn't overly crowded considering it was a weekend. However the service was considerably slow and our waitress was incredibly overwhelmed. She was very kind but my husband and I, along with the neighboring tables who she was responsible for, felt forgotten.  We placed our orders. I ordered the soup of the day as my appetizer and we each ordered entrees. The bread came out and my soup didn't. We waited for my soup for about 10 minutes and it eventually came about 2 minutes before our entrees ( so the table space was limited).  My plate was hot but the food on it was like warm... That didn't make sense.  I should also note that we were seated before a neighboring party of 4 and they all got their appetizers and entrees before my soup even came out.  My husband ordered a spicy buffalo chicken sandwich and asked for a side of blue cheese crumbles. It came out with blue cheese dressing,which was no big deal. We simply asked the food runner for the crumbles and that came our right away. Our server checked on us and we asked for more buffalo sauce since there was only a dash on the sandwich. It took about 10 minutes to get that ( and we had to remind her). So by the time my husband could enjoy his meal it was cold. That was disappointing.  We wanted dessert but there was no way I was going to sit around and wait for that. I just witnessed the party of 4 next to us wait about 15 minutes for their dessert. So we asked for the check which took another 10 minutes. We paid the bill and walked up to the to go counter and got our dessert in less than 3 minutes.  I felt our waitress was incredibly overwhelmed. I really feel like we spent the entire time just waiting. It took away from our dining experience. So I guess we will see what happens the next time we decide to eat there. I should also note that normally we sit along the wall with the windows that face the valet parking. Today we dined in the room over where the bar is. I wonder if the window tables just get better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=500,3.48,3.39,3.276,2.472,3.426

The restaurant is massive with a very nice outdoor seating patio.  Inside are booths and three separate rooms. All are with high ceilings and nicely decorated.  The service is consistently good and professional. The menu is huge, but they do have a lighter side menu that offers smaller portions with an emphasis on healthy choices. You can order straight American fair or Asian or even Latin choices. It's all there for you to choose from.  The food is quality and reasonably priced. My favorite is the Cuban sandwich, but there are a lot of other good choices. The iced tea is five star excellent, served in large glasses with free refills the way it should be.  Here are the pros and cons: Pros:  1. Tons of food choices including breakfast burritos all day long. 2. Iced tea is delicious  3. Great place to people watch (Spectrum) 4. Huge portions  5. Cheesecake heaven 6. Great service and good food 7. Reasonably prices Cons: 1. We usually have to wait to sit down.  2.

Let's note, that this happened during Monday night. Monday. It wasn't busy nor was it hustlin' and bustlin'. Had a group of 6 (plus a child) and waited about 10 minutes for a table, which is fine, I checked out the cheesecake selection at the bakery area.  Food was okay. Drinks were okay. Nothing spectacular. Had a very extensive menu but I just wish they would focus on something and make it GOOD. They have too many cultural items on their menu but they do not get the flavors right.  Appetizers: Factory Nachos, Fried Calamari, and Thai Lettuce Wraps. Nachos were pretty good actually, I love that the chips that were soaked in the toppings were crispy and crunchy instead of soggy from the cheese/sour cream/pico de gallo/guacamole. The chicken that was supposed to be in the nachos was nonexistent. Fried Calamari was weak. The sauces felt like they came out of a squeeze packet you get from a fast food joint, the amount of calamari was so little, and the breading had a weird and really bitter bitter aftertaste.  Thai lettuce wraps were okay. Liked the chicken.  Everyone ordered their own stuff, from Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane to Rib Eye and Herb Crusted Salmon. All I can say was the steak was okay, but the rest of the entrees was MEH. My herb crusted Salmon was gross, it was like too sweet and too lemony from the sauce. I didn't even finish it. And seriously the shrimp scampi? That was a pathetic excuse of an Italian dish. But then again, it is the cheesecake factory so we did know what we were going into when we entered.  Waitress was good, she was really nice and had good customer service. Decent, and went by our tables enough times.  Tiramisu cheesecake is nasty. White chocolate Raspberry truffle is delish though.  $228+ bill for decent customer service and overall crap food.

This was a good decision since we were seated just minutes later and received good service even though the restaurant was still pretty full. We sat in a booth facing the outdoor patio and it was nice to see all the lights from the mall and the movie theater. I ordered the garlic noodles and hubby the Chicken quesadillas. My noodle plate was pretty large, with lots of noodles, but not quite as much chicken and veggies. The noodles were VERY salty, I couldn't had more than a few bites. I told the waitress and she graciously offered to bring me another one or to exchange it. So I opted for the Chicken Da Vinci. By the time the second dish arrived, I was tired so I took a few bites (it was a little too al dente for me but flavor was fine) and asked to take it to go.   The following day I heated up at home and sure enough, the pasta was hard.

We parked in the structure nearest the movie theater and walked in.  I suppose you could valet for closer access to your car but we like a little spectrum stroll so the structure won. We walked in and there was about 10 people around waiting for tables but we only waited 10 mins or so - which I was thankful for since I got extra time to look at the menu. The novel-length menu gives me a mild anxiety attack every time.  Normally I'm a bit indecisive in ordering which is why I use my trusty yelp app to guide my restaurant endeavors but this trip my phone was dead so I asked our server what she recommended and she came back with ""Well what do you feel like?"" and all I could say was ""chicken"" so she directed me to the chicken page but I ended up throwing my hands up and letting my husband choose both dishes anyway.... go figure. If there's one thing I know about this place (besides the menu being 100+ entrees long) its that the portion is at least 3x the size it should be.  Thankfully, this trip around the menu stumped my husband as well so he and I agreed to share the two dishes he was between - it was his birthday after all. I ordered Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (Shrimp and Chicken Sautéed with Onions, Tomato and Peppers in a Very Spicy Cajun Sauce. All on Top of Fresh Linguini.) and he got the Chicken Bellagio (Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad). He doesn't normally eat greens so I got his arugula salad which was nicely dressed with a lemon dressing.  My Cajun Jambalaya was really delicious. I was actually very surprised that a chain could produce such tender linguini and the spice was just right... I wouldn't consider it ""very spicy"" like the menu states.  It was flavorful without blowing my head off or anything. My husband gave me a bite of his chicken bellagio and the prosciutto/chicken/basil pasta combo was very delicious as well.  I was happily surprised!  We both ate about half and took the rest home... the price reflects the portion - at least you know you're going to have a yummy lunch the next day as well! We ordered a piece of banana cheesecake to share and it was smooth and creamy with just the right amount of sweetness.  Sometimes cheesecake is too decadent to have more than 2 bites of... not this one. We definitely finished it. All in all, I was glad hubby chose this for his birthday meal.   I have a new respect for cheesecake factory and probably won't avoid it like the plague anymore... at least I know that I'll always have something new to try and I'll never exhaust the menu! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=300,3.48,3.41,3.304,2.8960000000000004,3.438

I agree that the set up and decor are the same and the menu items are the same. But I disagree that every Cheesecake Factory is the ""same"". I walked into this particular location planning to dislike it. Why? There were tons of people in line. It was a Friday night and it was noisy and crowded. I had to be at a concert and we decided to sit at the bar to avoid a wait for a table. Now I really didn't expect the bartenders to be happy about serving three customers dinner and only one bar drink out of the three of us. But I was wrong. The bartenders were awesome. I ordered a pineapple mojito and the avocado rolls. My son has the Caesar salad and my husband had the veggie burger and side salad. We all three love love love the bread that comes before dinner. The bartenders had no problem refilling our basket of bread! Let me start with the pineapple mojito. It was beautiful. It looked like something out of a food magazine. It tasted even better. The avocado rolls were served warm and with fresh avocado. I adore the dipping sauce it comes with.  My son ordered the appetizer sized salad and it was more than enough for my 21 year old son.  My husband enjoyed his veggie burger and salad. In the meantime the bartenders made sure to keep the non alcoholic drinks flowing and I sipped my oversized pineapple mojito the entire time we were there. My only complaint was the two couples, two older balding men with two blonde women in white dresses. They seemed to be in their 50s but acted and talked like teenagers. They decided to plant themselves directly behind us at the bar, one of the men put his hand on my chair back rest and made me feel very uncomfortable. They were talking very loud and were not respectful of personal space. That was not a reflection of the quality of food or service so I did not reduce the stars based on those rude customers.

I met my waitress Melanie.  She was very nice and accommodating.    As many people know, the menu here has alot of things to try, but today I was going to keep it simple and order spaghetti and meatballs.  Melanie comes back to inform me that they were *out of meatballs.  ok then....I told her I was interested in the rib eye steak.  *Denied!  They were out.  I then ordered something much less interesting: a burger.  Like many restaurants it appears the burger was cooked at a little too high a temperature resulting in a little surface charring.  Regardless, the charring was not too much to overlook.  Overall, I would give the burger an 8.  It was actually a good burger.  Partly into the meal, the manager...Anh?  can out and he told me the burger was on him.  Nice.  That was the proper thing to do in that situation.  As a customer, I appreciate the gesture to make up for what happened earlier.   Overall, Melanie was a very good server.  She was very friendly, and accommodating.  The manager passed my test, and performed great customer service by doing the right thing, and making it up to me.   This review I give them a 4 star.  If there were no hitches, I would not have had a problem giving them a 5 star. Suggestions: 1) Service was a little slow getting my water and initial bread.  Perhaps something can be done to make the customer wait less.   2) Maybe track sales better, and order more food based off those reports.

Although the crusted chicken and arugula salad were delicious, the basil pasta underneath was not cooked to perfection. It was on the hard side and the sauce was not distributed evenly.

598,Payam A.,"Lake Forest, CA",4,18,,1.0,2014-12-09,"Really don't like leaving negative reviews but had to let you know what an unbelievably poor experience we had! We ordered our food and waited a long time. OK, it was a busy weekend night. When the food finally arrived, we had no silverware. We wanted to let our server know, but she was in a real rush and ran off before we could explain what we needed. After that we waved to her a couple more times, but she was too busy to respond. We waved down another server who came by and said he would make sure we got our silverware immdiately, but we never saw him again. We waved down a third server, but he said he would let our server know immediately and she was the one who had to take care of our table. We were very frustrated after around 10 minutes of this, my friend got up and walked to the serving station which was only three tables away from us and was confronted by a bus-boy. He was told to go and sit down as 'guests' were not allowed to take silverware or napkins, they had to be deliverd by an employee. He tapped the bus-boy on the shoulder and laughingly told him we had waited for over ten minutes. He was sternly told to sit at his table and they would be brought soon. He returned a little shaken up and surprised at the experience. Almost 4 minutes later, the cutlery arrived, and we finally got to eat our food, which by now of course, was quite cold. My friend asked for a whole lemon so that it would not squirt everywhere when he squeeze it for the juice, and was told he would have to pay extra for it. My friend was surprised and said that was not right. A few minutes later, the manager arrived. I thought, 'good, he found out about our cutlery problem and is here to apologize'. Well here was the real shocker! He began to shout at us, telling my friend if he wanted a whole lemon he had to pay extra and then he started shouting that my friend had no right to touch an employee, and every time my friend tried to explain, he was immediately and aggressively interrupted and shouted down by the manager. I could not believe what was happening. Then I tried to talk too and the manager kept shouting saying if we didn't like it, we could leave! We were both in absolute shock and disbelief at what was happening and how we were being treated. Everyone within several tables of us, was now staring in our direction and at the spectacle. Completely embarrased and publicly humiliated, my friend agreed to pay extra for the lemon and the manager left in a huff. Our server was very apologetic and said she had no idea he was going to react that way. We had completely lost our appetite and could not eat anymore. We had barely eaten any of our food, and when the lemon arrived with more apologies from our server we just asked for the bill and our waitress brought it quickly and just kept on apologizing. We had spent over $80 on food we hadn't eaten and had been treated worse than criminals! Guests sitting at the tables around us said they were shocked at how poorly we had been treated, and would never come to this restaurant again. Two other guests, came by as they were leaving and voiced the same thing. One said the manager was a real bully and should be fired for what he had done. We got out of there with a horrible sick feeling. It ruined my whole weekend. Couldn't get the stress and embarrasment out of my head. I wrote to their corporate offices to let them know everything is not alright with their Irvine Spectrum restaurant. Have no desire to ever visit any Cheesecake factory again!

Since it was a Saturday evening, it was pretty packed. We were seated outside which was okay but, of course, people seated in the outdoor lounge areas were obnoxious. People clearly don't read the ""no smoking"" signs (think chain smokers that are just lounging without anything better to do on a Saturday night) and this older (mid to late 30s or maybe 40s) couple were making out (think soft porn.. I think I puked a little).  Now that you have an idea of the ambience, or lack thereof, on to the food and service. It was busy so I'll take it easy on the server. But when you run out of the brown bread, and double up on sourdough, make sure to bring the brown bread out when it's ready rather than me having to ask for it seeing other tables get served the usual brown and sour combo. THEN the server takes back the sourdough and comes out with a double up on brown. No, I didn't want any sourdough, thanks. Ugh. Then our food arrives, I ordered the chicken Alfredo. Big mistake. It had so much salt I literally drank 2.5 cups of water at the restaurant, ordered a strawberry lemonade to go (which I downed by the time I got back to my car) AND when I got to my next destination, I drank an entire Snapple.

About this time last year, I took my wife there for her birthday dinner. Without going into too much details about that visit, it was a disaster. Our waiter completely forgot about us and essentially ruined my wife's dinner.  So, yesterday was once again my wife's birthday and I wanted to take her out for dinner. This is an important birthday, it's my wife's 30th. She got a giftcard for Cheesecake Factory for Christmas and she decided that we should give this location another shot.  I walked into this trip with a very critical eye. I was not about to let anyone ruin this birthday for my wife. Once we were seated I started paying attention to all the details that matter (how long does it take to be greeted, are our drinks refilled, etc...).  After waiting less than 30 minutes to be seated, which was fantastic for a Friday night, we were seated and our waitress Brittani came over very quickly and got our drink order. Here's what made me know this was going to be a great trip, upon looking at my wife's ID, Brittani noticed that it was in fact my wife's birthday and wished her a happy one. Major points! We ordered dinner soon after and it came out pretty quickly. She ordered her favorite item on the menu, the Chickeb Bellagio. I changed things up and ordered the Hibachi Steak. It was awesome. Delicious mashed potatoes with a wasabi butter. The steak was great and cooked perfectly.  Of course, we ended the night by sharing a slice of cheesecake. Brittani in all her fantastic insight, brought a few coworkers with her to deliver the dessert. They sang happy birthday to my wife, which, while typical for a restaurant, meant a lot to me, considering how rough things were last year.  The only thing I can complain about was that one of the napkins on our table was stained with lipstick. It was a little gross, but they replaced it for us.

The meatloaf is huge! Everything there is huge! You can definitely share it with another person. Can't go home without a slice of cheesecake..

So you will be standing. Dinner waits are usually more than 30 minutes, and can be over 50 minutes on on the weekends. I personally don't have that type of patience as a party of two, so I've started to visit the Shops at Mission Viejo location more, where wait times are more reasonable. If you come for lunch during the week, you might not have to wait. On the weekends, could be around 15 minutes.  A few pointers: + tropical iced tea is delicious + I could live off of the bread baskets. And I'm not joking. If you dine with me, we will have at least two. (yes, I have an addiction to bread). + crusted chicken romano is the best dish. Lunch portion is plenty large, and I always have leftovers. + if you get the asian chicken salad, get it without the ""straws."" can't recall their exact name, but the white noodle things that come on top. look lovely but make eating the salad near impossible and are a huge filler. + if you don't like a TON of salad dressing, order it on the side. + service is always impeccable.  + indoor and outdoor (with heaters) seating available.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=140,2.92,3.21,3.276,2.8640000000000003,3.094
70,Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782.0,4.0,2015-01-13,"This Cheesecake Factory (CF) location is memorable to me because THIS is where I first tried the gourmet mac and cheese appetizer. My cousin had actually ordered it for her dinner, but it was seriously love at first bite. She prefers no-fuss, no-frills, straight-up mac and cheese (like the no-nonsense Kraft box kind), but I don't mind a little gourmet twist on my mac and cheese (panko crust, bacon bits, you name it). Thus, she wasn't too thrilled about her gourmet mac and cheese (which came in a bowl at that time), but I quickly devoured her leftovers! But I digress. I've only been to this CF location once, when I met some of my family members for dinner, but I remember being served quickly, and this CF restaurant seemed especially clean and nice because it was located in the Spectrum. I think we went for a pretty early dinner on a weeknight, so the eatery wasn't too crowded. The food tasted great, as usual; what we ordered was consistent in taste and flavor and dishes we ordered previously from other CF restaurants.  Here's what I would recommend: ""Fried Macaroni and Cheese"": This gooey, cheesy mac and cheese mixture gets even better when deep fried and covered with a thin, crispy crumb layer. Cheese simply oozes out of the shell with every bite (truly a must for cheese lovers). The four mac and cheese balls are served with a creamy marinara sauce (not a very strong tomatoey taste) and bits of shredded cheese on top.As mentioned previously, this was actually the first CF restaurant at which I discovered this amazing appetizer dish. It changed my life forever ... in fact, now I often order it as my meal! ""Snickers Bar Chunks and Cheesecake"": This is the BF's go-to and I always manage to get a bite of this cheesecake before he devours it all. Though it's not my favorite--since my favorite candy is Reese's, not Snickers--I would have to say that this cheesecake is in my top 5. It features chunks of the Snickers Bar baked right into the creamy cheesecake and it's topped with fudge and caramel. I also really like this cheesecake because (similar to the Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple) it features that crumbly OREO cookie crust. I love chomping on the candy bar bits and the fudge and caramel add the perfect finishing touch to this delectable treat. ""Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip"": Spinach and artichoke dips are probably my favorite appetizer, but TCF changes things up a bit but including crab in its rendition. No joke. This app features a blend of crab, artichokes and cheese served warm with grilled bread. Now, I love spinach, cheese and artichoke dips, but when you throw pieces of fresh crab in there, you take that dip to an entirely different level. I hope this dip is super cheesy--like, filled with gooey, melted cheese--and I can't wait to taste the accompanying grilled bread, too. ""Linda's Fudge Cake"": I always see this colossal cake in the cake display case by the bakery/to-go area, and I always, always wish that I could try it ... but I always get a cheesecake from dessert. However, if I did order something other than cheesecake for my dessert, this is at the top of my must-try list. It features layers of rich chocolate cake and fudge frosting. As a chocoholic, nothing sounds better! This is a straight-up, no-fuss, no-frills chocolate cake. No nuts, almonds, whipped cream or other toppings to get in my way. I'm not sure when, but I do want to indulge in this super chocolaty treat one day. ""Brioche Breakfast Sandwich"":  This breakfast sando features some of my favorite ingredients, making it one of the many items on my must-try list. It includes scrambled eggs, smoked bacon, ham, melted Cheddar cheese and mayo (I would get it without that grilled tomato) in between slices of grilled brioche bread. It also comes served with potatoes. I've never had TCF's potatoes yet, but I'm sure it comes with plenty of savory flavor and just enough salty taste. This breakfast sandwich sounds absolutely stellar with all those components ... I might just lapse into a food coma after partaking in this savory feast. Definitely an entrée I would want to get if I were in the mood for something savory to kick off the day. ""Monte Cristo Sandwich"": If I ever go to TCF for breakfast again, this is what I would want to try. It's not every day that you find a restaurant with Monte Cristo on the menu! This version features crunchy French toast that's stuffed with bacon, grilled ham, melted Swiss cheese and grilled ham. It's then dusted with powdered sugar and served with strawberry preserves. I don't care much about the strawberry component of this dish, but just reading the menu description already has me drooling. I haven't had a Monte Cristo with all of these components--usually it's with ham, cheese, the thick egg bread and powdered sugar--but because there's bacon and scrambled eggs in this version, I'm definitely looking forward to trying it one day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=240,3.0,3.24,3.276,2.8320000000000003,3.1440000000000006

On Sat Jan 24th  my husband, 10 month old baby and myself attempted to have dinner at the Cheesecake Factory at the Irvine Spectrum. We checked in at 7pm and were told it would be about 35 minute wait. After an hour, I go check what is happening only to find out they cant find my name in the computer even though I have a pager in my hand. I was asked to wait a few more minutes for them to clear off the next available table in the patio. 15 Minutes later after watching other people get seated, I once again go ask what is happening. It is now 8:30PM. We finally get seated. order our food...and an hour later, after everyone around us has been seated, fed and brought the check, we STILL had no food. So needless to say at now 9:30pm, as our 10 month old has had it and our evening is ruined we get up to leave without dinner and the waitress has the odacity to give us attitude. Upon our departure I ask to speak with the manager, out comes Erica Edwards who apparently was too busy to handle the situation at that moment and asked for my name and number so she can call later that night to discuss how the Cheesecake Factory would handle this. Well apparently their customers are not important as she never called. A few days later I called there and asked to speak with the General Manager, I was put on the phone with Dan who was very apologetic, and sounded like he was genuine and offered to send us a gift card to come back and give them another try.

227,Gary B.,"Irvine, CA",72,124,27.0,3.0,2015-03-10,"I really had to take a couple of days before posting a review for my experience, because quite frankly I was a bit confused as to how I was going to express my views. It was early evening and there was a slight chill in the air, but my wife and I decided to sit outdoors because it was pretty busy indoors and they had heaters on the patio. After being seated and receiving our drinks, some women were seated at the table next to us. Immediately after sitting down they asked the waiter to turn off the heat. Well the heater was being mutually shared by their table and ours. So do you think that the waiter bothered to ask if we would be ok with it being turned off, especially since we were seated first? NOPE! Anyway I sucked it up and went back to being chilly. So while ordering I jumped on the Fish and chips while my wife was being a bit more indecisive. She asked if she could possible get an Angel Hair Pasta with Marinara Sauce and Chicken. He replied by informing her that they had Angel Hair with Shrimp. She was insistent on what she wanted so he went to ask the Chef if they could do it. After taking forever he came back with an affirmative answer so my wife ordered it.  Being busy we figured it would take some tie to get our food and it did.  As we started eating I noticed my wife playing with her food. Now if you were to ever have dinner with us, you would soon discover that my wife never messes around and is always finished twice as fast as I am. Anyway, I asked what was wrong and she told me that the sauce was so spicy that she couldn't eat it. So I called our waiter over and explained that this wasn't the Marinara she asked for. After 3 or 4 ""Are you sure?"" comments he took it to the Chef in an attempt to have it done right the second time around. All the while I'm sitting there picking at my fish, but more about that later. 2 or 3 minutes later our waiter comes back with a saucer of Marinara Sauce and asks my wife if this would work. She tasted it and said that will be fine. Instead of taking her at her word he kept insisting on making sure. ""Are you sure?"" ""Are you really sure?"" ""Are you REALLY sure?"" ""We doing want to have to repeat this."" Of course by this time the people around us were captivated by the conversation taking place between my wife and our waiter. Back to my plate, I have Fish & Chips all of the time so I'm smart enough to know that I will find a small bone from time to time. This time was different. Rarely if ever have I bit into a piece of fish and had a bone be so thick that it pierced the roof of my mouth. There were so many bones that after picking through the first 2 pieces I gave up and left the rest. The bed of fries underneath the fish did a better job of playing fish with all of the grease they soaked up that I ate some of those instead. When it was all said and done, the $50.00 plus that we spent on this eating experience might have been better spent on a Filet-o-Fish sandwich snuck into a movie. I give this review only because I believe the waiters intentions were good. Yes he got a tip.

Because the curbside that you are supposed to go to is shared with the Valet Parking that services Paul Martin's and Javiers. You will have a really hard time getting to the Curbside area. So if you can, avoid doing the curbside pick up during peak valet times. 2) Request the free bread. It's yummy. Especially the dark bread. Foodwise, Cheesecake is a 3 star rating.

The only reason that I am giving it 4 stars, is because I knew they had a Skinny-licious menu, but they weren't given to us with the regular menu. Realizing this, I asked for a skinny-licious menu. The manager brought over a few, but said he didn't have enough of them for the entire table.  A majority of my group had already ordered, but didn't have the opportunity to order from a healthier menu, because they didn't get the menus in time.

743,DOUGLAS K.,"Tustin, CA",0,31,4.0,2.0,2015-04-04,"Just experienced very bad service from the hostess to bus boy to waiter to expediter. Problem is Manager is too busy with Administrative duties instead of training and overseeing his Staff. A bunch of college students who just go through the motions and mingle at the resister and talk. First,  Hostess wants to put us in a booth that is literally, no kidding, three feet from the bath room door. Really? And, nice restaurant design. Are you kidding me? Next Waiter acts like he is close to his shift end so we hurry up and order at 3pm. Next, we politely ask the Expediter for some more sauce for the avocado rolls (since they only give you about two teaspoons) and she does not say a word and just nods. I thank her when she brings it back and, again, she does not say a word. Made me feel like my request, and her job, was an inconvenience to her. Next, we ask the Waiter for some bread. He says he has to wait until it comes out of the oven. Really? Sat afternoon and the Manager is not assuring the cooks to have enough bread ?? Next, as we are eating and finishing our meals, the Waiter comes by twice, the bus boys walk by twice empty handed until we finally have to wave down our waiter and ask him to remove the empty plates and glasses. He does get a bus tray, instead he tries to stack as many as possible and in the process spills sauce and crumbs all over the table. Do you think he comes back with a towel to wipe it up? Nope, he just comes back and gives us the bill and places the bill folder right in sauce. I ask him to please just bring me a towel and I'll clean it up for him. Worst service I have ever experienced. You get better service at McDonalds or Taco Bell. Three people and a bill for $138 with this bad of service?

720,Chelsea M.,"Fullerton, CA",628,573,156.0,4.0,2015-04-06,"Hibachi Steak is certified Angus beef hanger steak with shiitake mushrooms, onions, and bean sprouts served with wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus. The steak was a great cut, but I think it would have been better served as whole with the shiitake, onion, and bean sprout mixture on top. The sauce that everything was tossed in was overpowering whole plate. It would have been better as a marinade for the steak and let it caramelize on the grill. The wasabi mashed potatoes did not quite match. This would have paired better with fish like miso-glazed salmon. The tempura asparagus were cooked perfectly with a crispy, light batter while retaining the green flavor of the asparagus. Rating: 2/5 Grilled Rib-Eye Steak is served with French fries. I think a couple of tempura onion rings snuck onto my plate as well. The ribeye was grilled to a perfect rare. The meat was beautifully marbled for a juicy, tender steak. The fries were fried perfectly with a golden brown crispy outside and tender on the inside. The tempura onion rings were fantastic! The batter was light and crispy on the outside and the onion was sweet and tender inside. Rating: 5/5 Kobe Burger is an American style Kobe beef burger topped with sautéed mushrooms and onions. I can't eat a burger without cheese so I added a slice of cheddar. One of my friends had ordered it on a prior visit and she loved it. I love Wagyu beef so I knew the next time, I had to try it. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare, blending the grilled flavor on the outside and taste the sweet, buttery flavor of the meat inside. This burger was onolicious! It's one of the best burgers I've ever had. The mushrooms and onions were the perfect topping. I am glad that I went with a green salad instead of fries. This was a burger to finish in one sitting. Reheating it would not do it justice. Rating: 5/5 Chicken Madeira is sautéed chicken breast topped with fresh asparagus, melted mozzarella, mushroom Madeira sauce, and served with mashed potatoes. This is my hubby's favorite dish of all time! He has been ordering it since we started dating back in the early 1990s. The flavor is always consistent and he always orders it for dinner. The chicken was tender and soaked up the addictive Madeira sauce. The mushrooms acted like sponges and absorbed the sauce as well. The mashed potatoes were creamy and had just enough lumpy texture of potato and red potato skin. Rating: 5/5 Cappuccino is double espresso and foamy steamed milk. I'm not sure what kind of beans that they use or if I'm just used to coffee in Europe, but the espresso used was very bitter and acidic. Even with sugar, the bitter bite just hits you like a freight train. Rating: 2/5 Chocolate Chip Cookie-Dough Cheesecake is creamy cheesecake loaded with chocolate chip cookie-dough and walnuts. The cheesecake was creamy and silky. The cookie-dough added a granular sugar texture and flavor. The chocolate chips can be hard as they were in the refrigerator but melt down pretty quickly on the palate. I also loved the whipped cream dollops sprinkled with even more chocolate chips. Rating: 5/5 Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple is creamy cheesecake swirled with caramel, peanut butter, Butterfinger and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. This is also my hubby's favorite cheesecake. He orders this cheesecake probably 90% of the time. It has all of his favorite flavors in it: chocolate, caramel, and peanut butter. It was very rich and decadent. He will usually take it home and will take two to three sittings to finish it. It goes great with a hot cup of coffee.

My companions and I ordered avocado egg rolls to start with. They were okay but I didn't expect much from them. However, how is it that the appetizer comes out before our beverages?  Thank god the kind bartender or runner brought me my pineapple Moscow mule or I feel like I would've been waiting forever. The Alcoholic drink was NOT what I expected. The entire ginger beer taste was non existent and what it came in was NOT a copper mug. Since when is that acceptable? Elizabeth failed to check on us & went to every other table she had besides us. My companions and I are servers. We know how it can be but how is it excusable to go to every other table but ours just bcus we look young and Asian?!  The pasta we had was not great and we could tell it had just sat at the window instead of being brought out.  She finally checked on us, made sure we were okay, but then disappeared again until we had to call for our check while she tried to scurry past us.

Service - 2 stars.  Couldn't figure out who our waitress was, I think they changed on us twice as someone either had to go on break or was leaving for the night.  Never knew who to flag down for a soda refill so ended up embarrassing myself asking another waitress who gave me a half eyeroll when she said she would let my server know. Facilities - 0 stars.  Please see below for my picture of the men's restroom on a Sunday night at 10:30pm.  The restaurant was nearly empty and the restrooms hadn't been cleaned in who knows how long.  This is the worst part about this place.  When either kid says they have to go to the restroom, I dread it as the men's restrooms here are always filthy.  I closed my eyes going in and hoped for the best, but this is what I got.

First of all, I was surprised that I was able to get all 3.  Normally other restaurants provide you with a soup + sandwich or a salad + sandwich.  At The Cheesecake Factory, you get all 3.  Even though it's a lunch option, they don't skimp out on the usual Cheesecake Factory portions.  There was more than enough food for me.   I liked the caesar salad I had and the chicken almond salad sandwich.  The soup was ok, I think it was chicken tortilla but was thicker than I'm used to and I think it felt like there was rice in it and not the crunchy tortilla.  Maybe it was a different soup.  Still, I enjoyed the meal, the portions, service, and price was fair.  I would come again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=200,3.0,3.05,3.236,2.6399999999999997,3.03

My husband I came here with our 8yr old and 2 yr old for dinner on 8/28/15. After the usual weekend 30 min+ wait we were seated. We ordered our food...I ordered a burger, my husband ordered pasta and for the kids we ordered the chicken madeira to share. We finished our food but the kids weren't that hungry so we had to get their chicken madeira to go. The next morning my son warmed up the left overs and began eating. As he bit into a bite he felt something hard and spit it out. I was absolutely horrified to see a metal screw come out of his mouth! Not a hair, or a dead bug or something gross but something physically DANGEROUS that could have ended very badly. Right away everyone stopped eating and I was so relieved I wasn't feeding that to my 2 yr old because I dont even want to think what could have happened if she'd been the one with that bite. Of,course I called them right away and was given Mike Macias (Manager) information. I spoke with him in a very civil and calm manner- I did not lay blame on him or did not disrespect him in any way. He wanted me to send him pictures and an email explaining everything, which my husband sent. After he saw the pictures he called my husband and spoke to him about investigating the problem He said he will look into how a screw got into our food and will send us a gift card to compensate us for the chicken madeira.  It's been well over a month and we have yet to receive any update regarding the issue- no follow up email, phone call, no gift card...nothing. Clearly loyal customers mean nothing to them.  It's not even care about the money or the gift card because we will not be eating there again so I don't need your gift card. If anything I'd want to get a refund back to my card. But the reason why I'm so upset is because they dont have the courtesy to even call or email a loyal customer to follow up after such a disturbing ordeal.

Party was starting in 30 min at this point ( he waited 45 min) , so they scrambled to make the food.  And they offered a 25% discount which was okay, but they could have done more.  The food was fine, people enjoyed the party, and now that I look at the receipt I realized that they didn't charge us for the party package, but a la carte!  My husband didn't know it was a specific package.  So we ended up with more food than we needed and got a discount,  but it was not what the order was supposed to be even after they found it on the desk!         I will probably never cater from them again, and would not recommend it to anyone.  The catering orders are not computerized so if you do it, I would call and call again to make sure they are literally cooking it right before you need it.   Party hosting is stressful enough, and I didn't need to be worried that I needed to delivery order pizza for my guests.   Seriously did not live up to my expectations at all.  I have ordered from other restaurants for parties ( I have three kids and never had a problem like this).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=440,2.48,2.92,3.1,2.5640000000000005,2.744

701,Grace C.,"Monrovia, CA",272,841,720.0,3.0,2015-11-05,"I had spent over 5 hours straight in Dave and Buster's playing one arcade game. No water break and no food break. At 5 pm, I was hungry, dehydrated, and tired. Walking around the Spectrum in search of food, I ended up towards the other end from D & B's at the Cheesecake Factory. Very minimal wait for a table of 2 (less than 10 minutes), despite coming in on a Sunday. First order of business was sodas all around to replenish the low blood sugar from the unexpecting fasting during arcade game play. The first glass of Coke was very refreshing. After getting some sugar in, it was easier to think about what to order. Round one was the spinach and cheese dip appetizer ($11.95), which came with tortilla chips and salsa. I was pleased it came hot to our table, the temperature just right for the cheesy spinach and artichoke gooeyness to be scooped up by the chips. Seared tuna tataki salad ($18.50). This is my usual go-to salad at the Cheesecake Factory and BJ's and any other chain restaurants if they have such a salad on the menu. I asked for dressing on the side, but the dish came with dressing mixed into the salad + an additional container of dressing on the side. -_- That sort of defeated the purpose of me asking. Other than more dressing than I requested and wanted (the salad was drenched in the usual amounts as a salad with dressing mixed in would be), the seared tuna's quality and freshness matched the price and the avocado slices were just the right amount of ripe. Louisiana chicken pasta ($16.95). BF opted for the full dinner size portion (lunch size is also available). I took a couple of bites and while good, it lacked a certain umph.

We were excited since it only took a few minutes to get seated and we were all hungry. Once we were seated it already took a few minutes for our server to come and get our drink order. It took even longer for the drinks and bread to come out. After a few more minutes we finally put in our order. I ordered the Renee's Special which one-Half of a Fresh Turkey Sandwich or Chicken-Almond Salad Sandwich, a cup of soup and a small salad. I asked our waitress which sandwich was more popular and she tells me the chicken-almond sandwich is a lot better so I said I'll take that one. The soup for that day was the loaded potato soup. We also ordered the carbonara and the egg roll sampler.  IT TOOK AN HOUR FOR OUR FOOD TO COME OUT!!! Why?!?!? I have no idea... No apology for it taking so long. No refills on our drinks until we ask. Simply ridiculous. We even asked a random employee if we can get more water and bread and she just looked at us and said ""you can ask your waitress for that"". Seriously?  The thing that I found to be even more ridiculous was that they gave me a turkey sandwich when I clearly said that I would want the chicken-almond salad sandwich. I have never complained to a manager on site, but I wanted to so bad. I was going to say something, but I did not want to wait another hour for them to make the correct sandwich.

Blonde brownie on bottom, then the caramel cheesecake, then the caramel mousse, and then topped off with salted caramel.  A little bit on the sweeter side and I wished it had just a little bit more of the salted caramel part.

Was seated outside but we requested to be inside to avoid the cold and had an additional wait of twenty minutes when the hostess forgot to add us back onto the waiting list. Needless to say, we were not happy when we found out that we were waiting for nothing. Hostess even started back talking to us, claiming we never asked to be seated. Not even a single apology. Are people not trained before working here?  The upsetting interaction with the lady in the front made our moods sour, but I was lit with joy when they brought out the bread and butter. Truly a classic. If I want to justify eating a slice of cheesecake for $9, this bread would be my justification. And probably the best part of the meal. Hubby and I split the chicken fingers, which was sub-par at best. (You're probably better off getting some KFC on a Tuesday--take advantage of they Tuesday $1 special!) We barely ate half of it, as the mashed potatoes and diced vegetables (cucumbers, pumpkin, other types of weird squash) along with the rye bread filled us up. The cheesecake came and we were delighted. Server toppled over my whipped cream so my Instagram photo was delayed a couple minutes. White chocolate macadamia nut and cheesecake did not mix at all. All I could taste was the nut (and these buggers were huge!) and barely any cheesecake. I'm a picky eater but last time I recalled this was the Cheesecake Factory not the Nuts With Cheesecake On The Side Factory. Overall service was splendid from the nice gentleman. Water was refilled quickly and he constantly checked up on our emotional well being.

898,Dave B.,"Irvine, CA",9,38,,2.0,2016-02-14,"Our family has always been big fans of the Cheesecake Factory.  Our previous experience has been mostly the location on Kalakaua Avenue in Waikiki where we have always been really happy with the decor, service, food quality and selection, etc. The reason that this location gets only 2 stars is due to the relatively lower food preparation quality compared with what we are used to.  The Waikiki location we normally eat at has noticably better food.  In particular we noticed that the Santa Fe salad at this location was uninspiring compared with the same salad ordered numerous times in Hawaii.  It lacked flavor compared with the other location.  Similarly the Burrito at the Irvine location was dry and filled with rice instead of saucey and delicious as we have been used to at the Hawaii location.   However, the Strawberry Shortcake was really good in Irvine... at least as good, maybe better than the eqivalent version in Hawaii. We continue to like The Cheesecake Factory and will likely go back...we only wish that the Irvine location could step up their game in the kitchen a bit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=300,2.96,2.94,3.064,2.472,2.948

Service: - Again, exceptional service. He was friendly and professional throughout the entire night.  Food: Fish Taco Plate - This was surprisingly quite tasty. Four crispy fish tacos with a different flavor profile. I liked how they put the fish on top of the taco so it doesn't get soggy from the veggies.

Our order came out after a long while, a looong while. But the server was attentive throughout, and very friendly. The chicken Madeira was brought out first, with a smile. Delicious as usual. A few minutes later, the turkey avocado sandwich, not by our server, was slid in front of me with such force that the sandwich slid across the plate, no smile, no ""Here ya go"", nothing. And the bread could have been a cornerstone in the house I dream of building one day. I couldn't even tear it, it barely bent. You know the way a bun looks if you microwave it? It gets wrinkled and shrunken. It was doused in some butter flavored something. Yuck. They took it back, with apologies, and very quickly brought out another. Very quickly. The bacon was less on the 2nd 'wich, but the bread was softer. Still microwaved. A mom knows microwaved bread. NOT toasted as the description tells. Still drenched in ""butter"" flavor. I couldn't eat it. Just completely disappointed. The manager gave us a free dessert. Thanks, unbeknownst to him it is my birthday, so that was something. I think this is my first food let down at TCF in the 10 years + we've been diners. The food is always good, and we've been in FL, NC, and all over SoCal. Blah. Lemon drop martini and mojito were on point though. But not good enough that I don't miss having dinner tonight. I brought it home thinking one of my kids would like it. Nah. Waste of twelve dollars.

Went to this Cheesecake Factory branch at the Spectrum a couple months ago with my family and a guest. Everything started out fine (if you forget about the ~45 minute wait after we got seated to actually get our food to us.... keep in mind it was pretty late at night and the restaurant was half empty). When our food did come to us (finally), that's when all the shit went down. For starters, you could totally tell the food was cold and not fresh. The worst part was when our waiter brought us our drinks, THERE WAS GUNK ON THE FREAKING CUP. LIKE SERIOUSLY?? YOU HAD ONE JOB. The glass had some disgusting brown ish on the inside of the glass (probably some leftover chocolate shake I imagine) but how could they have missed that?! And how disrespectful of them to just go along with it and serve it to a customer and not even care that it's there? It's not like they didn't see it.. it was pretty damn noticeable. Honestly, the cold food wasn't a huge problem, I get it, it's late and they all want to go home, whatever. I could care less if it wasn't 5-star quality dining. But that cup was disgusting!! And when I called over the waiter, he had the most smug, rude smile on his face and he laughed in our faces when I told him that about the situation. Then I asked him to bring the manager and he did, and I told him we are going to leave because of the disrespectful treatment we got from our waiter, along with our Albertsons frozen food lookin meals and disgusting, unwashed cup. He even made us PAY for the food. WE DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH THE FOOD AND WE TOOK LIKE TWO SIPS OF THE DRINK BEFORE SEEING THE GUNK INSIDE THE CUP. Very inconsiderate, rude, unprofessional workers and service. Do not go here unless you are looking for an hour-long migraine and food poisoning. 0/10 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. Anyways we paid and we bounced. We then headed to BJ's at the Tustin Marketplace and had an amazing experience there as per usual. Great quality food and quality people.

The food is absolutely horribly prepared.  I fear coming to this location because the food is not predictable and usually really bad.  The chefs here really cannot cook properly.  Sometimes its hit or miss but mostly its a miss.  Its consistently bad compared to other locations. For example, all the chicken dishes are hot and fried and it seems they try, but the overal execution is terrible Compared to other locations.  Too salty,  too much cheese,  Too watery, etc.   There are just always problems.  The chicken romano and chicken dipana are terribly prepared every single time.  They should be embarrassed for how bad it is every single time.   Just to be clear, they try but i think its because most of the chefs at Irvine cant cook that well and have to crank out too many dishes with no line chef making sure the food looks proper to send out. Now much of the staff is very nice and kind and attentive.   I cannot fault the wait staff or reception staff as usually they are very nice and kind. Today We waited over 5 minutes to order an entire cheesecake to go at the entrance and were totally ignored even when an employee came over to prepare desserts.  Unfortunate.  Usually they are really nice and helpful with a smile.  Maybe understaffed for July 4th.

98,Joshua S.,"San Diego, CA",198,486,234.0,2.0,2016-07-10,"So we are typically huge fans of the Cheesecake Factory. It's usually a go-to, although the Yard House is unbeatable IMO, but this Cheesecake has been subpar at best the four times we've been here.  The only reason I'm doing 2-stars versus a 1 is because we did have a semi-okay experience dining at the indoor bar side a few weeks ago. Service was okay, nothing to write home about, but the drinks were good and the food came out correct.  This review is based mainly on their new outdoor bar area. Been there three times in the last 1.5 weeks hoping it would be better each time and taking into consideration that it was new and might have some speed bumps.  The first time we weren't impressed. Service was s-l-O-w and the bar wasn't even busy. It seemed like a lot of confusion amongst the bartenders and servers. We had two drinks a piece but we waited for the second. Nobody thanked us for coming in, which is annoying when you pay over $45 for 4 drinks. We chalked it up as a bad night.  Went back a few nights ago hoping for a better experience. The bartender gal didn't seem to have much enthusiasm for being there as we were not greeted professionally and the drinks took a while. We left after we drank it. Main reason was it was super slow and the bartenders couldn't even check on us as we wanted to order another one. Too many places next door to have to wait for a bartender when they are standing around talking.  Last night did it for us. I posted a couple pics of food that just sat forever. It was disgusting. The bartenders couldn't not see it, the food runner saw it because he brought food out a couple times, and nobody bussed it. It was nasty. First off, we had to slide our bar stools down because nobody apparently bussed the dinner from whoever left the bar before us. That food sat there about ten mins after we got drinks also as the bartenders seemingly didn't care. I could see if it was slammed and nobody had time but that was far from the case. Anyways, what was tacky was my GF heard one of the bartenders say how the bar wasn't built properly and we could tell people were annoyed with probably how cramped it is back there. Then, the icing for us was this food and pineapple left by the departing guests prior to is sitting down. It sat so long literally about 40 mins. Eventually a bartender came around and took some of it but left a half a slice of pineapple between us and in front of new guests that sat down. They never came back. Long story short, the service literally sucked, the bar was filthy, and nobody cared enough to clean it up. My drink menu was sat down on top of crumbs that I had to blow away. Yuck. All that and hearing workers complain was enough for me.  Probably the last time we spend money there. Might try the indoor side again sometime but it will be a while. It's a shame because the outdoor space is cool but the service doesn't match.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=100,2.4,2.85,2.952,2.248,2.67

I can't seem to find anyone who hates it here. This review will focus only on their happy hour, which is Monday thru Friday from 4-6. We arrived at 5:30, expecting it to be packed on a Thursday afternoon, but found the bar area relatively empty, with only a few tables taken. Our server was there in seconds, offering water, and took our drink orders.  We ordered their specialty martini drinks on the happy hour menu for $5.50. They were delicious, and large. Before the drinks even arrived, she brought out a bread basket with butter, and it was warm and very tasty.  We placed our order for food, and chose the happy hour burger, the Vietnamese spring rolls, and the fried mix of avocado, zucchini, and mushroom.  The food arrived at our table surprisingly fast, about 5-7 minutes. Burger: Two patties, two slices of cheese, and a big brioche bun. A tasty burger for five bucks. Not the best, but top notch for a happy hour item. Fried stuff: Loved the dipping sauces, the mushrooms, and the zucchini, but wasn't into the fried avocado. Just weird on flavor and texture.  Spring rolls: I loved these, and the two dipping sauces. One was oily and spicy, the other peanut based. Both were good. I will order these for sure next time. Service: Fast, efficient, and friendly. At 5:50 our server came by again to check on us, and to inform us that happy hour would be ending soon, but that she would be back to tell us when last call for happy hour was. When she did, a few minutes later, we ordered another round of drinks, which arrived about two minutes later.  For two people, we ate half the burger, half the fried stuff, and all of the spring rolls.

But this time it was completely rare, it was bloody inside and burned outside. We asked the server to make it a little bit less rare, and when it came back it was still the same way and the server told us that when we order medium rare that's how it comes.

Spinach and cheese dip was mediocre at best, the spinach was flavorless and overtook the cheese. They didn't even bring jam with my friend's bagels after he asked for it. This place is a joke.

678,Cindy S.,"Irvine, CA",263,314,613.0,3.0,2016-08-05,"The Cheesecake Factory is well known for its novel of a menu.  It takes hours to get through and everything ordered on the menu is pretty average.  It's no surprise that if you are serving a wide array of offerings, it's hard to perfect a particular genre. I'd say nothing is terribly bad except for their lettuce wraps.  My suggestion is not to get asian food at a nonasian restaurant and you should be safe. Anyhoo, came here for national cheesecake day.  I remember having cheesecake at the factory and loving every bite of it.  As it turns out cheesecake has its own day just as mothers do but cheesecake extends for 2 days.  I'm not complaining for half-off cheesecake for two days.  I was ecstatic.  I usually stick to my 2 favorites: classic (sometimes with strawberry topping) or the pumpkin when it's in season.  They are to die for.  This go round I tried another popular flavor as recommended by a server there and I was sorely disappointed.  Had the white chocolate mac nut cheesecake.   The cheesecake part of the dessert was spot on but the nuts baked into it were old and stale tasting.  The topping had fresh nuts which was better but the old nuts ruined the overall flavor.  On top of that the whipped cream machine was broken so that couldn't mask the old nut flavor.  I will be back for national cheesecake day next year and maybe another visit in between.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=140,2.48,2.7,2.912,2.636,2.612

929,Tim D.,"Tustin, CA",139,1,,1.0,2016-08-28,"So I've always known the cheesecake factory had exceptional food, but this experience completely ruined any good taste in my mouth. Nothing wrong with the service in particular just the manager Wesley!  So, my fiance ordered a mojito and it came garnished with a fluttering bug inside. She told the waiter she did not want to drink it, because she is creeped out by bugs. The server trying to recover the situation naturally brought a new drink for my fiance saying it was ""on them"" and he was so sorry for the drink she received prior. All was well til the bill came and the mojito was still there ""not on them"". At that time my fiance brought it to the servers attention and he said that shouldn't be on there let me talk to my boss. So the boss came to our table of 12 and asked so who had the bug in their drink? So she responded ""me"".  Feeling somehow like she did something wrong. Then the manager Wesley responded sorry we don't comp alcohol.  So my finances uncle left to talk to Wesley privately and let him know they didn't care about the $11 dollar drink it was about them charging her for it even though they said they would take care of it. Then Wesley told her that she should have told a manager not her server that there was a bug in her drink.(once again she feels she has done something wrong). Then she witnessed the manager go reprimand the bartender for the bug. And our poor server was visibly uncomfortable during this mess not having any power to enhance his guests experience. It took 20 minutes to remove the mojito from the check, and an additional 20 to process the payment.(probably a penalty for the complaint). I expected a higher degree of customer service from somewhere as corporate. But this company must clearly be going through a struggle if you hire people like Wesley to chase your guests away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=340,2.64,2.74,2.884,2.372,2.7
670,Tifania N.,"Costa Mesa, CA",534,51,84.0,5.0,2016-08-31,"Ok so when I say that I've eaten at cheesecake factory, well over 250 times, I'm not joking you. My family literally eats here at least 1-2 times a week every week since I was little. I've stopped going that much, but my parents still go on the weekly. My brother was a waiter there. My parents know every server and manager, we even know the one in Dubai. They seat us before everyone if the line is long and they greet us when we come in because they know my parents. So I guess you could call me a Cheesecake Factory connoisseur  and this review is way over due. It's a rare occurrence if you open up our fridge and don't find a Cheesecake Factory box in there. I've tried almost every item on the menu, but I'm gonna go over some of my favorites and some menu hacks that I think are great.  First of all I only ask for the brown bread when I start, it's just better to me but that's a personal preference. Also I always ask for ranch dressing to dip the bread in when the waiter comes to the table. Sometimes my om will put butter on the brown bread and brown sugar and it's also delicious. Also remember that if the line is long you can seat yourself anywhere in the bar and the wait is never that long. The new patio here is beautiful too.  The best appetizers:  1. The Thai chicken lettuce wraps are amazing, i always used to order them as my main entree.  2. The Avocado egg rolls are also delicious, never get old.  3. The fried mac and cheese balls are a lot of peoples favorite, but they are a little to heavy and fried for me, still really good though.  4. The sweet corn tamale cakes are really good.  Underrated appetizers -buffalo blasts.  lighter appetizers -spring roles( good if you want something healthier -Roasted Artichoke (delicious balsamic dip) The sliders are pretty average I wouldn't opt for them, but good for kids.  Best Courses by category:  Top Pasta dishes  - Pasta Da Vinci (always good, but definitely need to ask for extra sauce on the side) - Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (good but spicy) - Four Cheese pasta with chicken (everyone's go to, simple but good) -Shrimp with angel hair is also simple but delicious.  Top Chicken Dishes  -Crusted Chicken Romano (substitute penne pasta and ask for extra sauce, way better) -Bang bang chicken and shrimp (if you like Thai) -Chicken madeira( Straight up AMAZING EVERY TIME) HIGHLY RECOMMEND -Chicken Picatta (NEEDS EXTRA SAUCE) -Spicy Cashew chicken(but wish it came with veggies) -The Factory burrito Grande (HUGEEEEE. For sharing. Grande is not a joke) Top Seafood  All the salmon options are fantastic but my opinion of the best flavors in order are      1. Miso      2. Thai       3. Barbeque      4. Grilled      5. Herb Crusted  -Jamaican black pepper shrimp is great too (served with plantains)  Top Steak dishes  -Hibachi steak is delicious (I order a side of mac and cheese in substitue of the mashed potatoes) -The steak Diane and the steak Diane medallions are so tender -most of the steaks are made really well  Burgers -Old fashioned burger (can't go wrong) -wild mushroom burger -blue cheese burger -Mac and Cheese burger (if you want something super heavy) -Veggie (just ok, wouldn't recommend over other dishes) Sandwiches -Grilled Chicken And Avocado Club (ask for ranch on the side, I ask for no mayo) -Chicken Parmesan Sandwich -California Cheesesteak Salads -Vegan cobb salad (healthy and delicious) -Bbq chicken salad (delicious, not very healthy though) Most of the salads actually aren't that healthy but they are good falafel salad (pretty bad, probably biased because I'm middle eastern so I know how good falafel should taste Desserts Dulce De leche caramel   Godiva  Red velvet (not sure if it's still on the menu)  Strawberry shortcake (ask for extra ice cream) No matter how sick of Cheesecake Factory I am it will always have a special place in my heart.

126,Nina Q.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",1,11,5.0,1.0,2016-09-18,"Went out with my mom friends last Saturday for an early dinner and movie night. We rarely have a night out without kids so we wanted it to be a fun night for us all. We decided to go early (4:30pm) and have dinner and drinks at Cheesecake Factory. We were seated right away, at that point I thought that we were lucky because there wasn't  a lot of people in the restaurant. The server took our drink orders, and the drinks came out just in time, then our server came back to bring our bread and to get our orders- Chicken Bellagio, Bistro Shrimp Pasta and Chicken Salad Sandwich with fruit. My girlfriends and I were chatting away when I noticed that the server brought the food of the people in the other table that were seated about 20 minutes after us. My friends and I realized that we have been sitting for well over 45 MINUTES already WITHOUT OUR FOOD. The SERVER DIDN'T COME BY OUR TABLE TO CHECK ON US though she had passed our table a number of times. My friend flagged down another server to ask where our food was, a few minutes later our server came by and said that she was sorry but she FORGOT TO PUT IN THE ORDER and that she told the kitchen to expedite our order so our food should come out soon. Another 20 MINUTES PASSED and our SERVER kept on PASSING OUR TABLE WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING. My friend flagged the server and asked how long our food will take, she said it should come out soon. A few minutes later a runner came out with a plate of sandwich and brought it to our table- IT WAS THE WRONG SANDWICH. Another runner brought the rest of our orders- but no chicken salad sandwich. Our SERVER PASSED THE TABLE ONCE AGAIN WITHOUT STOPPING AT OUR TABLE, my friend called her and asked where our other friend's sandwich was, the server casually said ""OH, I PRESSED THE WRONG BUTTON AND ORDERED THE WRONG SANDWICH instead of chicken salad sandwich, they're making it now""- NO APOLOGY WHATSOEVER! This was the 2nd TIME SHE MADE A MISTAKE AND DIDN'T APPEAR REMORSEFUL- DID NOT EVEN APOLOGIZE. At that point my friend got up and talked to the manager, the manager came by our table and apologized- she didn't know what was going on because the server didn't say anything to her except that she had to key in a code for a change order: Cuban sandwich to chicken salad sandwich. The server didn't even say that it was her fault. The manager offered us free dessert and said that she would come by again to check on us. At that point we were all pissed and had lost our appetite. Our supposedly fun night was ruined! We had a movie to catch so we had to go quickly. Our server came by with the dessert menu- no apology, no nothing- we declined the free dessert since we had to go straight to the movies. We asked for our check- the manager didn't come back.

My pasta tasted good and filled me up rather quickly. However, I did notice that the bottom of my plate was oily. I tried a piece of the Hibachi steak and that tasted amazing ! Next time I would definitely have to come back and try that. Towards the end our waiter brought out one ice cream with one candle and gave it to my brother who was furthest away from him and had to go in front of me to hand it to him. He then told him happy birthday then I think he remembered it was my birthday too and looked at me and said happy birthday to you too.

Firstly, I had asked for the avocado sauce to my salad on the side, but he misunderstood and charged me for a side of avocado. Secondly, he didn't mention that an up-charge for ahi Tuna was going to be $10. Even though they want it added you should let a customer know how much an additional charge is going to be.

As a bodybuilder you need to get extra calories after your training in order to make up part of your expending. It was 9pm and there were not so many diners. There are several parking lots, so feel free to drive! It has nice location, nice service, nice environment, fine tastes and reasonable price. It's a fine place to relieve your hunger. You will enjoy the appetizer. They offer two kinds of breads. The first one is traditional baguette. It's as hard as the dumbbell so you may want to cut it into little pieces. The second one is chocolate flavor baguette. This one is smooth enough like a yoga mat. REMEMBER THIS! Do not finish the bread before your 20 dollars main course comes. I don't think your stomach can hold all of them. The food I ordered is ""Shrimp with Angel Hair"". As you can tell, I chose this because of the name. What the heck is Angel Hair, right?  After it arrived, I saw my Angel Hair. It has beige coat and it does look like hairs. It tastes like real hairs too! Well, that's not true. It's just pasta, thinner pasta. The food serving is ok, enough for a hungry bodybuilder. One of my friends got a XXL one! I would say the serving is just right, no extra and no surplus. This meal cost us $100 total ($25 each) which is acceptable for a bodybuilder. Steaks and lettuce are much more expansive, aren't they! My hairs tasted bad at the beginning. Actually it had no taste at all. :( So we asked for more cheese. The situation turned better with the extra cheese. There were 6 large fresh shrimps huddled up around the plate and a heap of hairs winded in the middle. Grilled tomato pieces are dotted on the top. The whole thing is surrounded by Marinara Sauce. Overall my hair tastes ok, looks good and my friends said theirs are fine too. ;) Servers there are absolutely kind and patient. When I was here the first time, I was not sure about what the dishes are. Our waitress explained everything perfectly clear for us. My bio97 professor did the same thing during lecture! LOL One big disadvantage of The Cheesecake Factory is that it takes forever to make your food. I mean, how much time can making pasta takes? You may have to finish all bread and butter and a cup of drink before getting your main course but AGAIN, DON'T DO IT.

There were numerous open tables and it still took 10 minutes to be seated way in the back and the dark.The front staff staff chatted while deciding which table and where and then it took 2 people to escort a part of 2!

We were all shocked and bummed because this is not the norm at all for any Cheesecake Factory we've been to. Our waiter, Alejandro, was inattentive and largely absent. Our drinks were only refilled after asking multiple times. Another waiter (who was wonderful, I'm upset I missed his name) ended up taking our order because Alejandro was MIA. My father asked for more bread - it never came. My mother ordered a salad (from Alejandro, not from the good waiter). It never came. He never came to check up on us, and we sat with our empty appetizer plates crowding the table for ages until a busboy noticed and grabbed them up. We brushed it off and looked forward to our meals. Which were dreadful. I ordered the eggplant parmesan. My eggplant was undercooked. My mother had a dip sandwich that she said was all grease. My sister had a veggie melt, which she took a few bites of before abandoning for fries. The only one happy was my father, who had the Jambalaya and said it was very good. We would have alerted our waiter ... but he was missing.  By the time he reappeared, we'd given up and had a show to get to. In order to not be late, we simply paid and left.

We had just attended the funeral of my beloved Mother at a nearby cemetary. We chose this restaurant due to it's convenience and ability to please all members of our group with a variety menu. Once seated, we began to notice 'gnats'. A few at first, but as we waited for our meals it was apparent the 'gnats' were not diminishing in number. Mgmt was notified,  offered to relocate our entire group, but, not with a guarantee we would not deal with the bugs in another area. Mgmt informed us that the restaurant was due the following day to receive a 'monthly' bug treatment, and was very nonchalant about the ordeal. We tolerated the gnats, we ate our meals and then received the bill, $375.57. Nothing deducted. While waiting to pay our bill, members our family used the restroom facilities. As they walked down the hallway where restrooms are located, they passed by a small wait-staff area. There they noticed the parmesan cheese that had been grated upon several of our meals. It was uncovered and had GNATS on it! We watched our waitress go to thy area of the restaurant to retrieve the block of parmesan when it was requested. There is no doubt it was the same cheese!. Anyone had access to that cheese, yuck! If that wasn't enough, the cheese is in plain site of everyone, adults, children...bugs. Mgmt gave me a $50 gift card after all was said and done.

Food portions are quite large and the cheescakes are the same as any other cheesecake factory. Some of my favorite foods: - Thai Lettuce Wraps: 5/5 - Get ready to delve into your food. Making the lettuce wraps is always fun and the presentation of the plate is gorgeous. Add your grilled chicken into any of the lettuce wraps, drizzle on your favorite (or all) of the sauces, add the beansprouts, carrots, etc, and then consume. Not too heavy at all. - Chicken Madeira: 5/5 Tender chicken atop fluffy mashed potatoes and decorated with skinny asparagus. The dish is on the heavier side and will get you full quickly. Lots of flavor and texture going on, which I love. - Fave cheesecake: Banana Creme Cheesecake: 5/5 - If you are a fan of banana creme, try the banana cream cheesecake. Although I wish there was more than just the layer of banana cream on top of the cheesecake, it is still so good, and I recommend it!

I have been coming to this location for at least 10 years now and I have never had a bad experience with the food or customer service. My personal favorite pasta that I would recommend is their 'pasta da vinci'. It is a penne pasta served with mushrooms, caramelized onions, chicken, and a madeira wine sauce that is heavenly. I always like to ask for extra sauce on the side. This most recent visit, I decided to also try out a healthy option. I ordered their kale salad which was the best kale salad I've ever had. It came with lemon vinaigrette, grapes, and bell pepper...I added a side of avocado as well. If you're ever hesitant to try this place, you definitely shouldn't be.

My work is around here so my family and I would always come here and up until now, we were always super pleased with the customer service and food. However, after today we will not be coming here anymore. Firstly, our food was taking so long to come out that the table next to us (who sat down AFTER us) was already finished with their food. We pointed this out to our server, a guy named Christopher and after that, he was super rude and completely ignored us the entire night. His attitude towards us was so bad that the table next to us even noticed. We tried to ask for some sauce for my food and of course, he didn't bring it until we asked again. By this point the table next to us kindly asked their waiter for some sauce for my food because they noticed Christopher was completely ignoring us. They even joked that by the time we get our sauce it would be Christmas already. He ignored us until the end and didn't even bring us our check. And it's not because he forgot either, he intentionally ignored us and served all the tables around us, except us. And when we tried to get his attention, he shut us down telling us ""i'm talking to another customer.""  I really hope this restaurant does something about this because having a server like him is not going to help their business at all.

Nice and crispy and perfectly seasoned. I ordered a veggie burger with fries. The veggie burger here is made of rice, quinoa, beans, and more. My friend ordered the classic burger with a side of salad. Cheesecake Factory always gives large portions, as as usual we were so full we had to pack half our meal for later. And no room for dessert.

I have been recently scouring the OC on a hunt for FABULOUS Happy Hour eats and I am glad to have re-discovered this place. Honestly, I was ""done"" with The Cheesecake Factory years ago because I was tired of the ""chain""/pre-prepped food for $$. Orange County is brimming with fresh non-cookie cutter eats for about the same price, so I stopped eating here.  However, the other night my friend INSISTED that we go to TCF with a bunch of girlfriends for Happy Hour. We went straight to the bar and we were able to get 2 tables INSTANTLY!!! This was one of the tedious things that I hated about TCF. In the past, I have waited 1-2 hours to eat at this chain. The bar was too easy!! They even allow kids, which I don't think was the case years ago.  Margaritas and other cocktails for $5!!!! I was also sweetly surprised that the margaritas were really yummy and not watered down to cater to the HH crowds. They rivaled Javier's across the way...who does NOT have a HH menu...Ahem!!! The eats were also really good for the INCREDIBLE prices!!! They were all about $5. We got loaded nachos, sweet corn tamale cakes, southern fried chicken sliders, fried calamari, parmesan garlic cheese bread, edamame, & kale salad...had to throw some greens in there!! EVERYthing was full-sized & freshly prepared...for a chain. We left there happy & content...especially for only spending about $20 each (including tip!!!!!).  The AMBIENCE in the bar was spacious & the noise level was good. All of us could carry a conversation with one another without screaming or yelling over one another. Another PLUS is that the bar area is near a window...which I love. One wall is all glass so you can ""people watch"" the folks walking around The Spectrum, which is something I enjoy!!!

Despite their being little to no people there at the time, it took 45 minutes for our food to come out. When it finally did come out, my friend's salad had a food sticker in it! We alerted our server, who took back the food to be remade and sent the manager over to speak with us. He apologized for it and let us know it was being remade.  After the remade salad came out, everything was fine with the food. We were there for about two hours and our server came around to check on us and refill waters only twice. After we left we were ticked that we had to pay for the salad that they left their dirty food sticker in, so we only left an 8% tip instead of the ""suggested 15%"". But to be fare, they messed up our food and the service was below average. Before I had even left the table the server came around and looked at the bills to find her tip-- while i was still putting my jacket on. My friends had already exited the restaurant, as i was leaving my server chased me down to let me know that her tips are taxed and we are supposed to tip at least 15%.

By the time our name was called my sister walked in right on time, the wait was no more than 10 minutes which was excellent! We even got a booth instead of those half table/booth those are the worst! Our waitress came around to us in a timely manner, we didn't feel like she didn't know we were there which is a pet peeve of us when we go out! Even though she still had a good amount of tables she always checked on us and was attentive!  We mainly ordered appetizers so we could share without ordering a ton of food. We ordered: -Crispy crab bites -Chicken Potstickers -Sliders with fries -Custom pizza I loved our appetizers minus the seafood one (I didn't try it since I don't like seafood) my mom did note that our Potstickers could have been hotter which I agree, they were lukewarm :/ My sliders came on these perfectly buttered buns! The presentation was so cute! I filled up on bread and potstickers so I took the other half home. I haven't tried my sisters pizza yet but she said the pizza was lame :/ Hardly no sauce and was lacking that ""ooey gooey"" pizza feel. She gave her leftovers to me and I'm sure I can spruce it up a bit with more sauce!  They brought me out a free Sundae and sang HBD to me which was nice!

864,Lara K.,"Newport Beach, CA",8,29,1.0,2.0,2017-02-21,"I don't eat at Cheesecake all that often, but I do get nostalgic cravings every now again for the Avocado Egg Rolls. Today, Feb 21, 2017 we dinned in for lunch because I had a Free Slice of Cheesecake to redeem. Sadly, I rather lost my appetite within the first 30 seconds of being seated as there was extreme dirt and grim everywhere I looked.  Essentially the restaurant is not getting any deep cleanings. No one is wiping the edge of the table booth benches and mountains of dried up food was plastered to the bench just under my hamstrings behind my knees.  Additionally, the top of the black granite baseboards are not being wiped down and had layers of dust on them.  While the waiter was friendly enough he had dirt and grime under his fingernails. The bread was served near cold and a bit hard which was disappointing as I love the sourdough baguette bread. The Avocado Egg Rolls were just OK, not quite as good as they could have been. I went to the restroom and saw the restroom door plate covered in fingerprint smudges, but thankfully I am tall and always push on doors high up, around the 6ft mark. In the bathroom I entered a stall to which I had to become a contortionist to even close the door and since I am slender I can't help but wonder how larger people get in and out of the stalls. Personally I don't allow my clothing to ever tough the toilet bowl but it's a very tight space and requires agile movements to not rub up against the stall and bowl. There was toilet paper on the floor and the toilet flushed before I was done, with its auto-flush. As I exited the stall I observed 3 Cheesecake employees enter the bathroom. It appeared they were tidying up the sink area but to my amazement they left a wet paper towel sitting in the center basin. Then a young girl went into the stall I'd been in and with her bare hands picked up the toilet paper from the floor. That might have been great had she washed her hands before exiting the bathroom but she didn't and all I could think about is where she was headed next.  After lunch, up at the Cheesecake counter I ordered two slices of cheesecake to go. The counter area was also dusty but by this stage I had to stop looking at all the dirt. I also informed the cashier that I did not need a bag. Apparently she didn't understand what I meant and asked me something about the plastic containers so I tried to clarify that I didn't need a carry bag and so she pulled out a plastic carry bag and said one of these as if she still wasn't clear on the issue and I said yes, I have my own carry bag so I don't need to waste more plastic and she just gave me a look of disdain, as if I was some weirdo. She also told me she would let me know when the order was ready and it seemed as if she wanted me to leave the bakery area and go wait somewhere else but there was no one behind me so I stood at the cake front. Next thing I noticed is she was packaging the wrong slice of cake. So I asked her if that was our order and let her know it was the wrong cake. It's fine to make mistakes, we are all human but her attitude was abrasive and she was not friendly or personable at all.  In the end I won't be eating again at this location because of how unbelievably dirty it was. I know the guys that bus the tables work really hard but unfortunately management is not ensuring proper cleaning methods of the tables, benches, chairs, baseboards, countertops, etc.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=80,2.76,2.78,2.808,2.568,2.772

I always sit in the bar area since there's usually not much of a wait because this place can get pretty packed with the wait time sometimes over and hour.  The location is very clean and service is standard and consistent with all the other locations. I tried their chicken and shrimp pineapple curry (I think that's the name) out of the new featured items. It was tasty! You get to pick white or brown rice with it. The chicken and shrimp were crispy and flavorful and the peas really gave it a nice texture. I followed the entree with a slice of mango key lime pie and it was just what I needed to be fully satisfied.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=20,2.84,2.88,2.836,2.48,2.864

He ordered the stuffed mushrooms appetizer & the iron pan they were served them in was hot, the mushrooms just barely warm. We've had much better.  We finished the appetizer & our entrees arrived before my drink, a skinny cosmo. The cosmo was tasty but not my garlic lemon shrimp. It was so bland & boring, I added a lot of salt & pepper. I asked to substitute broccoli for the noodles. Basically a huge head of broccoli was on the plate not cut up into florets. On to the low carb cheesecake for dessert which was great. The only reason to go to this restaurant is for the cheesecake. Maybe they've fallen victim to way too many items on the entree menu & they  taste microwaved, even my husbands chicken dish.

We were seated on the patio. It took the waitress some time to come and see us, and when she did she was a little bit off. I am not sure if she was new or what was going on. I asked for a recommendation on a drink and she basically couldn't give me one. I ordered a small bite salad and the buffalo blasts and a glass of moscato. My friend had a Caesar salad. She got her drink and I never got my wine. By the time I was half way though the meal we also had not gotten any refills on water. She didn't come back until the end of the meal when we had to ask for more water.  Also with the buffalo blasts, it was like they weren't cooked right and in the frying process all of the chicken inside about half of them had fallen out because there was. I filling in them. It almost seems as though the cooks knew that was there case because there were big holes in the wonton, but they were turned upside down on the plate so you wouldn't notice until you picked it up. To make matters worse because the centers were kind of wet they stuck to the napkin that they had put on the bottom of the plate.

The food was fine once it actually came, no complaints there.   The waitress really could have cared less about the inconvenience of my friends not being able to actually eat their meals there, they had a few bites and took it with them to go.  My one friend asked to speak to the manager because she had noted specifically at the beginning that 2 of the people were on a time crunch and was upset our food seemed to come out as less of a priority than other tables. The manager was nice and took off the appetizer (which only the other 2 people ordered so it didn't benefit me in any way really).  She offered dessert but we declined.   When the bill came the waitress had forgotten to put on my coffee and made a point to come back with a new check for the 3.50 coffee which seemed petty considering the circumstance of a ruined lunch in which we didn't get to eat with our friends. After our 2 friends left I had some more coffee and the 2 of us left ended up ordering a piece of cheesecake to share.  Not that I wanted it for free but don't offer something and then not follow through.  On top of that the waitress stopped by every 3 minutes to ""check on us"" because I think she wanted us to leave.  I had come here 1 time previously and would rate that visit 3 stars.  On that visit we had to ask twice for a baby sling (to put the carrier in) before someone went and got it.  The service on that visit was otherwise okay but not spectacular.

Terry, our wonderful server, immediately asked what brought us in, and kindly congratulated my son, and made him feel like he was beyond special.

That kid looked like he'd been crowned the king!!! Eating his wontons and drinking a milkshake he said ""mom, Terry is the best waitress I've ever had""!!!! Insane!!

My favorite is the spaghetti with Marinara sauce on it and it is really good on the spaghetti it also has cheese on it that's so delicious. My other favorite is the mini corn dogs I can pick my own side and drink to go with it to. You can also pick other things to go with it you can even pick fries with it to.  I really love the different kinds of cakes there and I think you can get stuffed animals to. My favorite is the banana cake in the front of the restaurant. At the cheesecake factory you can eat the dessert at the restaurant or you can take it home.  The seating is very comfortable. and pretty there. The design is very beautiful there. On the couch chairs there is a bit of gold in it.   These are the things that I think is the best about the cheesecake factory.  -M,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=100,2.84,2.87,2.82,2.676,2.8579999999999997

In the middle of our meal, my friend starting freaking out. I assumed she got a horrible text or phone call but when I looked at what she was pointing to there was a cockroach in her salad. YES, I am not exaggerating nor am I making this up. This insect crawled out from bottom of her salad and was just laying on its back in the plate. When we told the server she immediately went and told her manager. What really put me off was when the manager came to our table, she apologized but then decided to say ""that did not come from inside our salad, it probably flew into your salad out here."" UGH NO LADY! This roach was covered in salad dressing and would not been if it ""flew"" into our salad and it crawled out from the bottom of the bed of lettuce. Instead of taking responsibility she blamed it on us for eating on the patio. Didn't get the managers name, but she was female, blonde short curly hair and eyelashes caked on with layers of mascara.

The kids pasta order came without the chicken that we asked for, he took it to the kitchen, came back 2 mins later telling us they're out of chicken and asked whether we still want it or he'll just take it back without asking if we want anything else for the kid to eat.  We asked for tissue, and when he got it, it fell out of his hands on a plate of fries, he basically said oops sorry, turned around and left immediately without even getting new clean ones!

We had a much shorter wait than I expected; we waited only 15 minutes for our table. We got seated in back which had a nice view of the high rises surrounded the premise. Since it was a beautiful California afternoon, it was a rather pleasant dining experience with the large windows.  It did take a little bit of time for the waiter to introduce himself but nothing out the ordinary for a busy Sunday afternoon. Since we utilized our time to figure out what we wanted to order before getting a table, that's why it felt longer to get our waiter. Since I am a vegetarian, I ordered one of their many pasta options without the chicken. The waiter was very cooperative with that.  Once we ordered our food, the waiter bought us the delicious bread. We didn't care too much for the sourdough but devoured the honey brown bread. The waiter was very proactive in filling our table with the bread because we kept eating it. To be honest, this is one of the reason I wanted to come here. Our waiter was also very proactive on making sure our water cups were full. He would make a round every now and then and kindly ask if we wanted more water before pouring. We appreciated the fact he kept checking up on us and also gave us update on when the food would be arriving.  Once we got the food, the quality of the food was excellent. I think for my dish, they could have gave me more portion but the quality was excellent. I ordered the Skinnylicious Chicken Pasta without the chicken. It wasn't the usual pasta I had at every Italian Restaurant and it was refreshing to have something different.  Since I stuffed myself with all the bread, I didn't have any room in my stomach for their signature cheesecake. My friends ordered a slice to go so I'll take a bite later.

My most recent dinner here was a little atypical since I came around 10:30pm on a Friday night. They usually close at 11pm on other weekdays but Fridays they close at 12:30am so it was okay. We were seated right away and within 5 minutes, our server came. She was very nice and friendly and took our orders and asked if we wanted bread. We said yes and a few minutes later, she came back with bread and butter. However, there was only rye bread instead of the usual sourdough, white, and rye. It was okay though, I think it's just cause we came so late. But then, she also gave us butter but no butter knives. We used our spoons to spread the butter.  Then, she came back and said they were out of the buffalo blasts - once again, our fault for coming so late. So then we ordered the fried cheese (mozzarella sticks). They were shaped like Doritos and tasted wonderful. It came with marinara sauce but the sauce tasted a little to watery and tomato-y.  Our spicy chipotle chicken pasta came and it was delicious as always. When she was taking our order, I asked if they could split it (Which they usually do) but she said that she could just bring an extra plate. I thought it was weird since I've never had the cheesecake factory not split my entree when asked. But it's okay, maybe they just don't do that here. However, she also forgot to ask if we wanted cheese grated on top!  The pasta itself isn't too creamy or spicy, it's a very light hint of spice. It's perfectly savory and the portion is def share worthy. To end the night, we got the tiramisu cheesecake which was delicious.

One negative aspect is the wait, although they have a lot of tables many of them are not open for service.

The server came over and asked for our drink order.  Either a long night or just her, but man she was not friendly to deal with.  She was very rushed and gave us the feeling that we were slowing her down by not knowing exactly what we wanted to drink after 30 seconds of sitting down.  It wasn't busy, so I still don't understand the rush.    After hastily giving our drink orders, she returned to take our dinner orders. I asked her a question about a burger because I wanted to make sure I was getting what I wanted.  Don't worry - that piece of information will come back into play later. After awhile the food came and this is where it got really bad.  First, the orders came individually and at slow intervals.  Someone got their plate of food and then a few minutes later someone else got their order and so on.  After about 10 minutes, we all had our food.  Mine was last and it was wrong.  It came with some items on it I definitely didn't want (which is why I asked about it during ordering).  The guy who brought the food took it back to fix it.  When the waitress returned she said, ""earlier you challenged me on what came on your burger and I was wrong, so we're getting that taken care of for you.""  What an odd way to phrase that.  I challenged her?  It's called asking a question.  That somewhat passive aggressive statement really defined her service all night. Someone else at the table ordered baked potato soup and after one spoonful almost spit it out.  She said there was something clearly wrong with it, but couldn't figure out what it was.  We were all just curious at that point and took tastes and it was definitely very odd/gross tasting.  Almost like baked potato soup got mixed with clam chowder and rotten onions.  We sent that back of course.  But she didn't want anything else - the taste really killed it for her. My burger finally returned, but of course with another issue. I like my burgers cooked a bit more and ordered it medium well.  It wasn't.  It was medium rare - very undercooked.  I think they remade it and then rushed it. I hate undercooked ground beef.  I ate around the edges was done.  Didn't want to deal with it anymore.  And on top of all that, several other severs would stop by our table wanting to drop off food that we didn't order.  ""Who had the spaghetti?""  ""Not us"".  That happened with different items like 5 times during the evening.  I just wanted to leave.  I was done.  An odd terrible dining ""experience"". Why is this a big deal?  Not just because it was my birthday, but more importantly, we had a group of friends together that don't get to see each other that often and we just wanted to enjoy a meal together.  And  this restaurant wouldn't let us have a nice meal together.  We got a rushed passive aggressive server, staggered orders so we couldn't even eat as a group, gross food that tasted very troubling, and incorrect orders.  Now, I'm sure Cheesecake factory will respond to this review with the same somewhat generic response they've responded to ALL the negative reviews... and if you look there are a lot of them.  They'll apologize, say that they hope we return and give them another chance (can't wait for that - and plus, why the hell would I want to?), they'll very subtly shift blame and tell you that you should have let a manager know, and say they'll say they'll talk and address this with the team.  But that's all nonsense.  Look at all the negative reviews... if this place actually addressed the issues here like they say, why would it still be such a disaster?  Nothing will be done.  Cheap PR on Yelp to save face a bit. We wasted money and time here and hopefully this review will help you avoid doing the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine,3.16,2.85,2.816,1.988,2.974

At the 3 hour mark we walked out with our appetizers thank you very much!  We are a group of business leaders that specialize in customer service and this entire experience made us cringe.

However, once seated we waited nearly 20 minutes before anyone stopped at our table to offer us water. We finally had a server arrive who apologized and stated that there was a mix up in servers assigned to our table. We ordered an appetizer and our entrees. Our appetizer finally makes it to our table and we meet our new server. Nothing against our new server, David, as he did his best to provide great customer service. After an hour of waiting patiently, our entrees finally arrive. Unfortunately, there was a mix up in the kitchen with one of our entrees, lack of sauce for the rest and an incompetent manager that brought us to the worse dinner experience ever at a Cheesecake Factory. After an additional 30 minute wait on the corrected entree, our server apologized yet again and said he would send the manager over to help address not only the service provided or lack thereof as well as issues with our entrees. The manager arrives at our table and only addresses our friend who encountered the entree issue. She leaves without bothering to ask the table how everyone's dinner was and overall experience was. Shall I add, this manager Jamie Mattera does not provide an introduction. I only learned of her name when I asked for Cheesecake Factory's corporate number. Not once does she ask what she can do to resolve the obvious. Needless to say we will not be returning to this location, as not only was the service poor but the food was not the normal quality you receive at a Cheesecake Factory. I believe this is a direct reflection on the manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=100,2.2,2.77,2.752,,2.5420000000000003

One salad, a kids corn dogs, a kid pasta and one half turkey and soup. I enjoyed my burger. It was so filling I couldn't finish it as hard as I tried.

Unfortunately there are certain times (including Friday nights) when they are unable to make reservations, so we had to wait about 40 minutes to be seated. I wouldn't suggest waiting inside the restaurant because it is really rowdy, with lots of children running around. If you can find room in the bar, that's a nice place to chill out while waiting for a table. As always, Cheesecake Factory offers a menu filled with a wide selection of dishes (which are all massive-- big enough to share), complimentary bread baskets, and of course amazing dessert!

23,Chase P.,"Beverly Hills, CA",26,36,11.0,1.0,2018-01-06,"This was literally the WORST restaurant experience I've ever had. I LOVE Cheesecake Factory. Obviously their food is so good and they have a huge menu. BUT.......the service I had tonight was HORRIBLE. I felt like I was being punk'd. CCF is one of the most known restaurants and this is the only one I've had a bad experience at. Usually they have very good/experienced waiters who are on it and I'm wondering if the waiter I had tonight is always like this or if it was just a bad day for him. I was looking around because I literally thought there were cameras or something and we were being pranked.  So my girlfriend, her friend, and I were going to have dinner and my gfs friend has been there plenty of times. She usually never has an issue. Our first waiter came to our table and said ""Hello, I'll be your waiter for the next five minutes."" That was just a weird way to approach customers. Anyways, our second waiter approached us in a nice manner and seemed fine. He took our order and then we asked for more bread. Five minutes later he came back and gave us water and asked if we needed anything else. Once again, we asked for more bread. No complaints. I understand people forget sometimes. Thirty minutes later he brought our food, which is normal, but then brought the bread after. Not a huge deal so whatever.  WHAT REALLY GOT ME is when he asked if we need anything else after we were done eating and we said we'd like to order cheesecake. He asked what kind, we told him what we wanted, and then he said he'll go get it. About ten minutes later he came back and was like ""can I get you guys anything else."" Once again, we told him what type of cc we wanted. He said he'll go get it. He then came five min later AGAIN, and asked what type of cheesecake we wanted because he forgot. At this point, I'm like is he high or just very forgetful. So we told him again. The FOURTH time he came back and said ""we had a mix up in the bakery with some receipts. The receipt machine broke.......so what kind of cheesecake did you want?"" We told him AGAIN. I feel like that was a lie to cover up him forgetting for the fourth time. We just thought it was funny and laughed about it but wasn't too annoyed......yet. Luckily, we weren't in a rush or anything but if this were to happen to anybody else, they would of complained to a manager at this point. I was whatever about it because we had plenty of time so oh well.  Later on, he brought the check and combined all three of our orders, without asking if we'd like so split. So I asked if he could split the check between my girlfriend and I, and her friend. He took the check and left but then about 10 min later, he came back with the same check and acted like nothing was wrong. I was convinced that we were being punk'd at this point. I was so confused, shocked, and annoyed. I waited for him to come back and asked again if we can split the check. He took the check again and brought us two separate checks this time. My total was like $47 and some change so I put two 20s and a ten then handed it to him. He brought back the check and said I owe $12.34!????? I was so frustrated and told him I gave him $50 and he argued with me saying that I didn't pay cash???? So I explained like 5 times that I paid $50 cash and finally he was like ""oh I gave you the wrong ticket."" He then brought back the correct ticket and said sorry about that, have a good night. I will NEVER be going back to this restaurant. Instead of complaining to a manager, I just left a $2 tip. I didn't want to complain and him possibly get fired because I don't know what his situation is or what personal problems he has. Definitely did not expect this to happen at CCF.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine,2.56,2.76,2.808,,2.68
22,Shay N.,"Beverly Hills, CA",165,151,127.0,1.0,2018-01-07,"Just had the WORST visit to CCF that I've ever had. I have visited many locations in different states and have always had excellent experiences but today was unbelievable. I came here with two other people today (my boyfriend and friend). When we sat down, our waiter said he had 5 minutes left and someone else would be taking over. Once the new waiter arrived, I believe his name was Michael?, he seemed nice but we had no idea we would be stuck there for another 4 hours. After our dinner arrived, our waiter asked if we wanted anything else. My friend and I ordered a Smores cheesecake and a Salted caramel cheesecake. He said okay and left. 10 minutes later he came back and asked if we wanted dessert. We looked a little confused but repeated our order anyway. He left for another 10 minutes and came back and asked what we ordered. So we told him AGAIN. At this point, we are wondering why he did not write the order down. It was embarrassing that we had to tell him so many times.. Another 10 minutes goes by, he comes back around and says ""the receipt printer is broke can you tell me what your order was?"" So we told him AGAIN. Finally after waiting 45 minutes on our cheesecake, he finally brought it. For a while there, we actually thought we were being pranked because none of us have ever experienced something like this.  But the evening didn't end there. He brought a check by, it said 74 dollars. He didn't ask if we wanted to split it so we asked if we could split it (one check for my boyfriend and I combined, and another check for my friend). He said okay and took the check and walked away. 15 minutes later, he comes back and asks if we wanted to order anything. We looked at him, said no thanks, and he walked away. He came back shortly after with the SAME check and acted like we never asked for our check split. So we sat and waited for him to come back so we could tell him we wanted to split it again. Another 10 minutes goes by and he eventually comes by with the split check..  Our total ended up being around 47 dollars for my boyfriend and I. We put down TWO $20 bills and ONE $10.. He took our checks and came back saying we owed him $12 dollars. At this point we were furious. My boyfriend told him we paid with TWO $20s and ONE $10 and the waiter sat there ARGUING with us saying we did not give him any cash. We asked him how else would we have paid and he KEPT arguing saying we did not pay cash, again and again. After a few minutes he pulled out a check from his pocket and said ""oh is this your money??"" and Of course it was our correct ticket with both $20's and our $10. We have never heard of a waiter misplacing our money and then blaming us and accusing us of not paying.  I cannot believe that the management would let a waiter act like this to customers. We were so furious that we did not even wait for the manager. We hurried up and left as fast as we could since we had been there for almost 4 hours because our waiter kept us. What we dont understand is how tables with more people next to us, came in and out much faster than our table of 3... Either way, it was a miserable experience and I do not understand why this is acceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine,2.56,2.76,2.8,,2.68
21,Monica D.,"Orange County, CA",751,678,46.0,2.0,2018-01-08,"Et tu, Cheesecake Factory? I can't believe this abysmally low rating I'm giving to start out my 2018 on Yelp. But my brunch experience with the family this past Sunday sadly dashed my traditionally high expectations. Our server, Michael, and everyone else front of house that we encountered was very kind, if not a bit... off, to say the least. The hosts and hostesses seemed flummoxed, to put it mildly. If they're all turned upside down during quite possibly one of the busiest times of the week, then something else may be amiss. Toward the end of our meal, servers were asking if we would like boxes. Before we were all done. Then it took forever and a day to close out the bill. Right after receiving our food, we practically had to keep our water refills at bay. As we again were finishing, water was nowhere to be found. Thankfully a smile and genuine positive attitude, which all of our CF FOH exhibited, go a truly long way. Seven in our party, seven orders clearly made, six dishes come out. The missing one? The freaking pancakes, bacon and eggs. The easiest food. The kitchen had to redo my cousin's overeasy eggs because they'd become 'over hard' in the interim. What??? Apologies abound. These minute faults could easily be overlooked had I not been SUPREMELY disappointed in my entree. Fried chicken and waffles Benedict??? How could this go wrong? Chicken: fresh and plentiful but dreadfully underseasoned. A waffle clearly neither dense nor crisp enough to hold the weight of a Benedict dish. The breakfast potatoes, Hollandaise sauce and poached eggs were simply lovely. But sides, accompaniments, and nicely cooked eggs does not a brunch specialty make. The most heartbreaking component of this dish was the maple butter syrup. Which, btw, tasted like neither maple nor butter. Nor syrup. It was a thickened, glossy, watery version of lightly seasoned margarine. I don't get why this is even served when this is supposed to be the piece de resistance tying together an ambitious fusion dish as such. Anyway, the saving graces: the Pasta Napoletana, though denounced as being excessively unhealthy, is super yummy. Everyone else mostly loved their burgers and chicken dishes. Lastly, our key lime cheesecake was to die for! Sorry, Cheesecake Factory, but you're gonna have to win me back eventually if I'm gonna drop that much coin and wait that long for meh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine,2.48,2.73,2.804,,2.63
