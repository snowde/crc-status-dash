70,Burger G.,"Jacksonville, FL",6,24,,4.0,2012-04-09,"The Cheesecake factory was our next target for doing a burger review.  One of the reasons was that I heard they had a Kobe burger.  Let me get right to the meat of things sorte say. Right from the start I have to say the burger looked great.  Everything looked fresh, well presented. Cutting open the burger was perfectly cooked just how I ordered it.  Now, here comes the important part.  Was my first bite the wow factor that I expected.  Well, yes and no.  I was looking for that, oh my God, this is Kobe meat. The cows that are feed only the best and from what I've seen on TV being massaged to make the meat nice and juicy.  Hmmm, maybe I was expecting someone to come by and massage me while I'm eating this.  I really don't know what I expected.  But, it didn't happen.  Now for the overall taste of the burger I have to admit.  That was one great tasting burger.  It was juicy, well seasoned, perfectly cooked.  Everything a burger should have.  Did I taste anything different?  Sorry to say, I didn't.  As from some of our previous reviews you can get some great tasting burger from regular beef.  Would I recommend this burger to someone?  Absolutely.  It was a great, great burger.  One of best I had and for this they get a high score from us as a 8 out of 10 for burgers.  To read our entire review, please visit us at   and check out our other reviews for the best burger in Jacksonville.  Lucky for us Burgergeeks it just means, the hunt continues, for the holy grail of Burgers.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=240,3.84,3.84,3.84,2.9280000000000004,3.84

86,Bill K.,"Jacksonville, FL",98,376,419.0,4.0,2012-12-15,"We went to The Cheesecake Factory (TCF) for dinner last night, only because my wife loves their Chicken Maderia and when my wife is happy all is well with the world. I'm not a big fan of TCF but I will endure it for her. So we get there and park nowhere near the enterance, but maybe a 15 minute walk away which is not bad for the Town Center. We finally fight our way to the hostess booth (like salmon fighting to get upstream) and are told its a 45 minute wait. Now I usually don't hardly ever wait but ""somebody"" who shall remain nameless gave me a look that said ""Were Waiting"" so we waited. Went into the bar area and actually found 2 seats at the bar next to each olther and ordered drinks, A Mai Tai for the missus and a craft beer for me. I was then informed that TCF doesn't have any craft beers on tap or anywhere. The bartender said that the closet they had was a Sierra Nevada which didn't taste too bad, but still not what I really wanted. The tab for that was $17 which to me is ridiculous for 1 Mai Tai and an average bottled beer. Finally 1/2 hr later our pager goes off and were lead to a really small table in the back and wait for our server, (who was fantastic BTW) and ordered 2 iced teas and an order of Onion rings to munch on. Along with my wifes Chicken Maderia  and my (server recommended) Mahi Mediterrainian, The Onion rings arrived and truth be told they were the best Onion Rings I have ever eaten, I just wish they had some/any sauce that accompanied them other than catsup, like most other places do. The food arrives in a timely manner and it's, it's uasual great tasting self.

I tried to make sure I ordered something semi-healthy since the food here is kinda horrible for you, so I ordered the skinny burger with no buttered bun, a slice of cheese and a salad instead of fries with the dressing on the side. They brought me just a plain burger on a buttered bun (really? why do I need butter with a hamburger? America, man.) and plain salad. They did bring me out a slice of cheese when I asked and offered to have it melted for me, but by that point I was so done here and wanted to just go.

248,Craig E.,"Jacksonville, FL",47,58,5.0,3.0,2013-07-05,"I have eaten at a couple of Cheesecake Factory locations between NY and Florida, and they are all pretty consistent.  Food quality is always good, although often unremarkable.  That said, I have to admit I am not one to frequent what I call restaurant ""factories"" - large corporate chains where there is always a wait of some length, too many noisy people, etc.  On this particular outing, we arrived for dinner around 6 and had to wait a short time - 5 -10 minutes.  We got crammed into a very small table for 2 in a row of small tables with constant traffic behind us in the aisle.  One of the reasons I don't like these huge restaurant factories....... Drinks and appetizer course were delivered promptly, and we enjoyed the Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls - although it was hard to find any shrimp in them.  We've had much better at our local Thai restaurant. Dinners were Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp with brown rice, and Fish Tacos with cilantro rice and black beans on the side.  Both dishes were cooked right and the portions were generous.  The tacos were in soft corn tortillas, with a fairly substantial piece of fried fish in each.  A little lacking in seasoning, but good quality.  The brown rice made the Bang Bang plate more interesting, better texture than plain white rice and the sauce had a good balance of seasoning and mild heat.  However, if you have sampled the Bang Bang shrimp at a Bonefish Grill restaurant then Cheesecake Factory doesn't quite make the grade.  The Bonefish version is killer, Cheesecake Factory is just ok.  Of course, if you are eating at Cheesecake Factory - what do you have for dessert?  We had a piece of Reece's Peanut Butter and a piece of Lemon Raspberry Cream.  Hard to beat - they were everything we expected.  Then again, $7.50 for a slice of cheesecake?  We're not going to do that very often.  Bill with tax and tap went over $80. So, overall we enjoyed the food but think it is overpriced for what it is.  You can get better quality at independent local restaurants for less - except for the cheesecake.  If you like to spend too much in a crowded noisy restaurant for food that is decent but not exceptional (once again, excepting the cheesecake) - by all means go ahead.  Its not bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=160,2.96,2.96,2.96,3.2760000000000007,2.96
208,Jamie V.,"Jacksonville, FL",113,197,308.0,3.0,2013-07-11,"For a chain restaurant it's pretty decent.  I'm a big fan of the sweet corn tamale cakes - even found a copycat recipe and tried it.  Portions at this place are outrageous and I always end up taking at last half my meal home.   The addition of small plates to the menu was a nice touch.  My last visit was during a hot summer day and I didn't want anything too heavy.  My friend and I shared the kale salad, tamale cakes and lettuce wraps.  The kale salad was kale, cranberries, apples, almonds and green beans in a creamy dressing  We both really liked it.  The tamale cakes were fabulous as always.  And we barely touched the lettuce wraps.  I took the rest home for later.  I was tempted by the caramel macadamia nut white chocolate cheesecake but resisted.  Frankly I find many of the cheesecakes too rich and can only have a few bites. The restaurant was busy as usual but just a few minutes wait so quicker than normal.  Service was particularly slow.  I don't know if our server was overloaded or if we were a ""cheap"" check and got ignored.  I waited way longer than I like to get a to-go box and the check.    I'll also give this warning - be careful when paying with a credit card.  Both my mother and I had card numbers skimmed months apart from each other immediately after using them at Cheescake.  And both cards were higher limit credit cards that had not been used for a couple weeks prior to usage at Cheesecake.  My mom's card was duplicated and fraudulent charges made within two hours of paying.  My card was used within three days in Europe to buy about $2k worth of airplane tickets.  Both of us never had card numbers stolen before nor have we had an issues after.  Frankly, I think it's too similar to have been a coincidence and while I have absolutely no proof, I believe some servers were involved in a skimming ring.   I called management both times and was brushed off.  Obviously I've continued to go to the restaurant since I was there a couple weeks ago, but now I always use cash.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=120,2.92,2.92,2.92,3.2120000000000006,2.92

196,Athena C.,"Jacksonville, FL",423,179,788.0,5.0,2014-01-24,"I'm finally writing this review now (a few months after my visit) because my dumb phone was in service at the Sprint in the town center.  My boyfriend and I were enjoying our day of errands and I begged him to let us go to Cheesecake Factory because I've been dying to go. I love cheesecake and apparently they also have regular meals here, too. Whodathought?! So, after trying to find parking in a very full Town Center we were the first people there. They open right at 11 am and we were seated right away in this big whopping table. I felt so tiny in the booth.  We started off with the parmesan-garlic cheese bread with the marinara sauce for dipping and a tortilla soup. The tortilla soup had a spicy little kick to it, but not enough to make the mouth burn too much. The bread was delicious, aside from the original bread they usually provide to snack on while you're waiting on your food. My boyfriend ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich with French fries. I had the herb crusted filet of salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes.  The portions were generous, and by generous I mean there was no way I finishing that AND eating a piece of their fabulous cheesecake, too.  The chicken parmesan was perfectly cooked on the most deliciously toasted French bread. The French fries were on and nothing spectacular, but still filling. The sandwich was delicious.  My salmon was cooked to flaky perfection and the zesty lemon sauce made for a perfect complement to the herbs it was seasoned with. I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes because I like the chunks of potatoes and the skins mixed into the creamy goodness. I thoroughly enjoyed my food and will be looking forward to exploring the rest of the menu.  I, of course, being the cheesecake fan that I am HAD to order some. I mean, it is, after all, the cheesecake factory, right? So after perusing the long list of over 30 flavors of cheesecake I finally decided on the White Chocolate and Macadamia Nut cheesecake.  *drools* it was the most decadent cheesecake with a delicious flavor I've ever had.

They originally put us in this itty-bitty table right near the doorway but the waitress was very astute and noticed that we didn't really fit in there so she moved us to a booth. It was a Friday night at perhaps 9 o'clock so it was crowded but there was no wait. We ordered the fried avocado, zucchini and Portobello appetizer which was shockingly good. It's so simple but I never thought to fry avocado and it just explodes in your mouth with flavor. I also ordered the crab dip which was not so good. There was a good amount of crabmeat in the dip however it was probably overcooked so it was crab and cheese and possibly mayonnaise and it was very greasy. It was served with a handful of basically homemade croutons   This could have been so much better if executed correctly. We ordered two frozen drinks which turned out to be $10 apiece which is kind of expensive for Jacksonville for not really high-level alcohol brands. For dinner I ordered the Thai shrimp and chicken. The taste was quite good although they poured a ton of pepper on the shrimp which made it distracting. The presentation was nice and the food was good but probably because it was so late it appeared that the cooks were just on autopilot.  We also ordered a shrimp pasta which was supposed to have fried shrimp and a lemon cream sauce with Fettuccini noodles, mushrooms, and asparagus.  This also appears to be a victim of a tired cook. The flavor of the sauce was okay but the noodles were very dry and the shrimp appeared to be dunked in a batter and then sautéed in a pan. The results of that is that one side was crispy brown the other side was basically still soft batter   The waitress noticed that I could not eat the shrimp from my Thai  chicken and shrimp because it was just way too spicy completely covered with pepper, and she offered to take it back but I didn't want to get any ""special sauce""...  For dessert we ordered blueberry cheesecake with white chocolate and the DuLce de Leche cheesecake. Both were exceptionally delicious.  I also ordered the double chocolate cheesecake to bring home to my son and he said it was excellent also it was thick and rich and chocolatey.  All in all it was an adequate dining experience but the waitress was great. I might come back there but I would not order the menu items we ordered except for the fried zucchini avocado appetizer. Price for 2 drinks 2 apps 2 entrees and 3 cheesecakes was $110 before tip.

On a different day, I went to this cheesecake factory and bought a cheesecake and it was wonderful. One of the things I like most about this location, and perhaps all the cheesecake factories, is the robust menu.

But it's consistently delicious and that wins big in my book. On one of our recent trips to the Town Center we decided to pop in to an old stand by; we opted to grab a seat at the bar rather than wait for a table.   We ordered the salmon firecracker rolls to start. They are one of the highlighted items on the 'lighter options' menu. Definitely a tasty option and I loved that they weren't rolled in a heavy wrapper. Just the thinnest of wrappers that provided just the right amount of crunch. It's perfect for two people to share because you each get two pieces.  For my entree, I went with the Eggplant Parm Sandwich. Definitely a knife and fork kind of sandwich as it is top heavy with eggplant. My only complaint about the meal would be the preparation on the eggplant. I've learned to salt my eggplant (multiple times) at home to pull out all the excess water. It helps it not be as spongy in cooking. While I still ate every bite, the eggplant was approaching spongy. The sammie is so large, I had enough leftover to repurpose half my sandwich into a whole second sandwich the next day for lunch. Pressed eggplant held up very well.

203,RoverTreks T.,"Green Cove Springs, FL",2,129,52.0,3.0,2014-12-16,"5-Star cheesecake and 3-star dining experience I've thought about what rating to issue this place for 7-years.   And I've always struggled with my decision.   That's because there's a stark difference between the ""cheesecake experience"" and the ""rest of the restaurant"" experience. In short, if you go for the cheesecake, you'll experience is a 5.   Otherwise, this is just an average restaurant.   Details Seven years ago, I ate at this restaurant and left feeling something was not quite right about the experience.  Off and on since then, I've visited when in the area.  I've always come away with the same feeling.   This has been my experience every time I eat at this restaurant.   And I keep going back thinking that my next experience will be different.   Partly, that's because my experience with this chain has been good elsewhere. We've all been there.  At one time or another in our lives, we've eaten at a restaurant  and left with that ""something is not quite right"" feeling.   Either the food is tasteless, or ""off"", not fresh,  --- but not quite right.   And sometimes it is difficult to pin down what exactly is wrong or where improvements can be made. This raises a question:  how does one rate a place that is ""not quite right""?  An experience between 1 and 5 is average.  Hence, my 3-star rating.  I ordered a cup of coffee and a club sandwich with a salad as a side recently.  The coffee was burnt and I sent it back.  That was an easy call.  Either coffee is burnt or it isn't.   Foul tasting coffee usually stems from unclean brewers (white vinegar folks!) or leaving a pot coffee too long on a heating element. The club sandwich was beautiful.  The toast was just right.  Each section was chock full of meat and veggies with a skewer through the middle.  But they were tasteless.  My immediate thought was, ""why do I keep coming back?"" The salad was OK but there was something off about it too.  It was drenched in blue cheese dressing.  Perhaps this was the problem?  I can't say.    My wife ordered the lettuce Mexican tacos for lunch.  She reports they were OK, not great.  The good news?  The Peppermint Cheesecake was excellent.   When we left the restaurant my wife said, ""well, that was a waste of $40.  The only reason to go there is for the cheesecake"". And that's what we've resolved to do in the future.  I want to give this restaurant a 5-star rating -- truly I do.   I've written my consistent, visceral reaction here for the first time after visits over many years.    Usually, when I write less than stellar reviews, I try to leave tips for the restaurant to consider.  I wish I could be more specific here.  Go for the Cheesecake and you'll get a 5-star experience.  With all else, lower your expectations.  To be fair, I haven't tried all 200+ offerings.  Those I have tried, spanning salads, pizzas, heavier dinner-like entrees, to breakfasts are just OK at best.   I'm resolved.  This is a 3-star dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=120,3.52,3.52,3.52,3.0200000000000005,3.5200000000000005

190,Annie K.,"Atlantic Beach, FL",729,41,393.0,4.0,2015-02-15,"We decided to make a visit to Cheesecake Factory tonight. We were both craving it and it sounded like a fast easy dinner that we both enjoy. It ended up being not so fast but ended well. When we got there it was quite a surprise even for tomorrow being a holiday that it was jammed packed! They told us that it would be 20 minutes at 7:15. By the time I pager went off it was 8 o'clock. Thinking that we were being sat 45 minutes later we then waited another 10 minutes to get our table. I do understand the uncertainty of never predicting how business will be in a restaurant but a fair judgment of giving wait times is only common curtesy.  When we were sat we noticed that we were sat in a section that a large party just got up so the poor server got quadruple sat with four two top tables. I completely felt for how he was feeling because I know how it is as a server to be in this position. He definitely didn't let the challenge stop him from delivering great service. We ordered both our favorite dirty martinis that are always delicious with fresh Blue cheese olives. We also ordered our favorite appetizer the shrimp spring rolls with a delicious peanut and ginger dipping sauce. My husband always gets his favorite pasta Da Vinci and I decided to try something new the luau salad which was absolutely phenomenal! The salad was enormous it could've fed four! With excellent flavors of mango, macadamia nuts thin sliced chicken all layered on crisp wontons with a sesame drizzle and green onions and green beans it was all so fresh and delicious. I will definitely order it again! Not to mention it will be lunch tomorrow!

Strange, most high end restaurants with chefs cooking, prepare steak with sauces!  My ribbye was served with single side of French fries....

I've never really understood why people choose to frequent this place when it is overpriced and the food is poor to mediocre in quality and flavor. However, the cheesecake is great (because all cheesecake is great)!  The only reason I actually stopped in for lunch was because a very gracious student gave me a gift card for the restaurant after I mentored her for a month. I've been to a few other locations in different cities throughout the nation and have had a similar experience (hey, at least they're consistent). I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta (a horridly bland thing that I later found out has over 2000 calories!! - how!? The stuff tasted like nothing) that was aggravatingly disappointing. I love Louisiana and I love pasta so surely some sort of magic should have happened... but lets just say that it was très ennuyeux. It was an insult to one of the most vibrant areas of the country.  As far as service was concerned, it was pretty poor too. Our server was working way too many tables for his skill level and wasn't managing very well. Service was slow and not all that impressive.  The only thing that was great was the cheesecake... and let's face it, that's because it combines two of the greatest things known to man: cheese and cake. Voila! Ecstasy! Cheesecake factory is not the best cheesecake in the world but it is good and probably one of the better ones you'll find in Jax (although I can't be sure because I've never had cheesecake at any other restaurant in Jax so don't believe a word of that statement - I just assume that Jax isn't teeming with cheesecakeries).

My advice, tell your party to arrive earlier than you actually want to sit, be sure the majority of your party is present before putting your name on the list. They'll back list you otherwise. Here's what I ordered: passion fruit monitor (amazing), tomato basil pasta (too much garlic, not enough mozzarella), chicken picatta (decent), limoncello cheesecake (yummo, my fave), and tiramisu cheesecake (not bad). Now to the good, our server, Brent, was fantastic. Very patient and polite with a sense of humor. My drinks were always full and the food was timed great - even my take out meal.

True New York Cheesecake is creamy, melt in your mouth and made with quality cream cheese and sour cream. Cheesecake Factory Cheesecake is simply ok. They cover their lack of quality ingredients (such as premium cheese) by utilizing half of the ""cheesecake"" disguised by peanut butter or cookie dough, red velvet et cetera. Those things should accentuate not make up half of the cheesecake. As for the dinners as Cheesecake Factory, they are your basic chain menu. They do not stand out as exceptional.

(outside area) We needed a particular spot because we did have a stroller. We sat down, our waitress was very nice and all was good. After we ordered, 4 people sat down next to us. And they started smoking. And not just smoking, CHAIN SMOKING!!! Did I mention, I was with a 5 month baby? I politely asked one of the waiters (not our girl) if this was even allowed. She questioned it for a second and told me she would double check. She came back and told me they had full right to smoke and I kinda had to deal with it. She asked if we wanted to be moved inside and I said no. We waited 40 min to get this particular table. Our night was officially done! The 2 couples next to us over heard this and on purpose smoked away. Even when there food arrived. I was so upset and couldnt believe it! Didnt I go to a family restaurant or to a bar?!  When our food came, I honestly had no appetite. All I could smell is smoke. I barely ate it. It was disgusting to me. My husband finished eating and we were out! We left so fast! I couldnt believe we just paid for an evening out and we absolutely hated it!

We all met up and walked inside. It's about 11:45-Noon and there was no wait. Thank god. We sat in a booth on the side near the front. The ""Jags in London"" game was on and the bar area was full and glued to the TVs. Not interested. We spent most of the time gabbing but we did over food, eventually. I got a Strawberry Lemonade to drink and it was good but sweet. Most of the syrup was on the bottom. And the glasses it came in were huge! Wow. I spent most of the time stuck on the brunch and eggs & omelettes menu inserts since it was still that time and settled on the Crab Hash: Sauteed Crab, Red, Yellow, and Green Peppers, Onions and Potatoes, and topped with two Poached Eggs with Hollandaise Sauce. My dining companions were skeptical about that dish like, how much crab, is it real crab, is there a lot of hash, etc. But I bit the bullet, it sounded good and I was gonna get it. Our server was very attentive and brought us bread service and oh my goodness. I loved that the bread was of different varieties and the butter, while packaged, tasted freshly churned. It was about 15-20 mins before our food came out and I tore into it, after my family inspected it. It was delicious! Everything was great. I couldn't eat the toast that also came with it or all the potatoes. But that's ok. I was saving room for dessert I'd been told beforehand that they had Mango Key Lime Cheesecake so I only focused on that one and got it.

The other side effect of packing in customers is the noise level makes it hard to have conversations. It was disappointing. It took awhile using their weird lengthy menu, flipping through alternating advertisements and menu items. I feel the ""healthy"" items are unnecessary, no one comes to The Cheese Cake Factory to eat healthy. The extra dishes just bloat the menu even more.

Ordered Buffalo Blasts®, which is blobs of buffalo chicken dip battered and fried. They were actually very good and plenty for two people. For my main dish, Pasta With Chicken And Scampi Sauce, it was delicious. Garlic, cream, and pasta! I was hooked as soon as I read it.

Seating: They at first sat us at the smallest tiniest table width wise, and really far length wise. I couldn't hear what my bf was saying across from me, and I was closer to the person next to me than I was to him. I'd rather talk to my date than a random stranger at a nice dinner, so we asked to move. Drinks: We ordered an extra dirty martini. When it arrived, it didn't have any olives in it, so I sent it back to get olives. I feel that this is just common bartending knowledge. I've never gotten a dirty martini that didn't come with olives! Was it just that the bartender didn't care? When it came back I found that it wasn't dirty at all. I sent it back again and it was barely dirty but I didn't feel like sending it back a third time. I feel that to a restaurant that is this expensive and claims to have a bar that an extra dirty martini shouldn't be this complicated. I could have made it better myself and gotten it right the first time. An extra dirty martini shouldn't have to be sent back three times. It is a very simple drink to make. Food: My food, the farfalle pasta with chicken, tasted exactly like the premade frozen bags of pasta in the freezer section. The pasta was undercooked and hard. The sauce came out of a bag. I didn't even want the leftovers. My bf wanted something that wasn't on the menu exactly which threw the kitchen into a loop. We wanted pasta, but wanted some steak chopped on top of it. We were willing to pay for both the pasta dish and the steak separately. Our waiter asked the kitchen if they could do this, but they were too corporate. They couldn't present the dish other than it usually made because it would mess up the plating. To me, that's stupid. So they gave us the steak separate and we had to cut it up ourselves and put it on top of the pasta. I feel that the kitchen could have done this. It wasn't that complicated. Not a big deal but still. Service: Our server was great, two stars are for him! He was only hindered but the lack of drink making skills of the bartender. And the cheesecake was delicious as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=80,3.36,3.46,3.46,2.6320000000000006,3.4200000000000004

This time I got a Cesar salad and a margarita pizza. Neither were very good and both tasted bland.   The lighting is dim and the decor is very wannabe-fancy.

126,Ralph S.,"Miramar Beach, FL",33,342,542.0,4.0,2016-06-18,"The Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant. I have eaten in them from one side of the country to the other. The menus are not unique in each restaurant so when going to one of their locations, one can be quite certain the dishes that will be available. So, while there is less drama or concern about a restaurant one may have when going to a mom and pop restaurant in a strip shopping mall, the chain is successful for a reason. The food is very good, there is a long menu and their desserts are hard to resist. On our latest visit to a Cheesecake Factory in Jacksonville, FL, I opted for a pasta dish with angel hair pasta, shrimp with garlic and on a bed of asparagus. The pasta was perfect. The shrimp were very flavorful and also cooked perfectly. I even liked the asparagus which is not often a dish that I favor.  My dining companion has a flatbread margherita dish that would pass for a margherita pizza in many restaurants but it is not as thick. I was not offered any of the dish so I cannot speak from personal experience but my lack of tasting opportunity was due to the fact it was very good and she wanted to eat all of it herself. I like the low calorie menu options that are available for those who care about such things while eating at a restaurant called the Cheesecake Factory. Options are good and I usually order off of this menu although sometimes I will finish the meal with a piece of the red velvet cheesecake. If I were in therapy, no doubt the psychologist would make something out of this foible. There are about 40 different flavors of cheesecake that will either appeal to everyone or generate stomach problems when thinking about the possibility of consuming so many calories at one meal.  I have never had a piece of any of the options that I did not like. Enjoy the dessert and plan on hitting the gym shortly. There is a good wine list at the Cheesecake Factory as well. It is not one that would put a good Italian restaurant to shame but still there are plenty of choices and the prices are reasonable. I like the restaurant. I still do not understand the decor. It looks like a large bar and dining area sitting inside of an Egyptian pyramid. Interesting and good conversation piece with no apparent reason for the selection. Anyone eating here could be forgiven for thinking they are on a movie set playing the role of a movie extra chowing down a large meal topped off with a large piece of cheesecake. The Cheesecake Factory is worth a trip. Not very expensive for the quality of the food and portion sizes served.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=40,3.08,3.35,3.35,3.024,3.242

No problems with the first lunch, except maybe a while to get the check if I'm nitpicking. Food was delicious, full of flavor. Loved the ratatouille and broccoli sides specifically which had lots of garlic. Yum-o! They have a big healthy menu called Skinnylicious and mom I both had salads the vegetable one for me and the chopped Cobb for her. Both were really good and full of vegetables and toppings abd almost more stuff in the salad the lettuce. On Friday I ordered the same thing and noticed there were very little vegetables in my vegetable salad mostly lettuce. When I told the waitress she said ""oh I can bring you some on the side"". Also had the salad drenched in salad dressing which I had clearly ordered on side and the waitress had repeated it back to me. When I asked the waitress to take it back she rolled her eyes at me. Sorry that would warrant a 1 star rating from me automatically but based on the great lunch Tuesday I averaged the stars. Maybe it was an off day, but I don't really think being busy is an excuse for bad service. Also noticed how the broccoli came out almost raw Friday and completely plain with no garlic nothing. It didn't taste very good and almost broke a tooth trying to chew it. I hate sending food back so I ate it, but come on some constancy would be great.

Well my friend had ordered just the mushrooms multiple times before with no issue.  A whole later or drinks came out and there was something floating in mine, we had to wait about 15 minutes for him to come back.  At this time we managed to order with him and beg for bread for about the 3rd time. (Normally it's brought out)  FINALLY his relief came, she was awesome. Continuously checked on us, packed our food up and brought cheesecake. All in a timely manner.  I understand you're getting off work and you won't be receiving a tip from the tables around us, BUT you choose to be a waiter- suck it up and work like you would be receiving a tip until your relief shows up. Otherwise change jobs... The fried cheese was delicious and so was the fried mushrooms!  I had the orange chicken, I wasn't a fan of honestly and my friend had the crusted chicken breast with mashed potatoes. It smelt amazing and she said it was yummy, wish I would've ordered it So many options, can't go wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=40,3.2,3.29,3.29,3.308,3.254

The peas were firm. The amount of bacon was nice and subtle. I had the lemon raspberry cheesecake for desert. The cheesecake was very nice.  After the healthy portion size of the pasta I did not want a huge slice of cheesecake. The size of the slice was just what I wanted, reasonable and not gargantuan.

My key dish at this place has been the Hibachi steak for quite some time.  I've had it in so many places now I've lost count.  It's made just as good here as just about any other place I've had it.   The service again just like all the other restaurants in this golden standard of chains is just as good.  I can't say I've ever been disappointed at the food or service at any Cheesecake Factory, this one included.

She loves cheesecakes so this was the place she picked for her birthday dinner.  When I did carryout, it was usually in the late evenings and I thought to myself, when I this place never packed? Apparently around 5 pm. We were able to get a table with no problems. Even when we left at 6 something, it wasn't busy. Probably avoid late evenings or weekends to avoid the crowd. Their menu is large, perhaps too big. It's hard for an indecisive person like myself to pick. I ended up ordering the Santa Fe salad. It was good and huge. I was only able to eat half of it. Wished I had requested the dressing on the side bc everything was coated with the vinaigrette. My oldest ordered the pasta carbonara and hubby ordered the shrimp scampi and steak Diane combo. Both were delicious. The birthday girl ordered a spaghetti and meatball from the kids menu but barely touched it, she was probably only there for the dessert.  Their cheesecakes are good but can be super rich. Their red velvet, original with strawberry, and white chocolate and raspberry truffle are probably my favorites. My daughter picked the oreo dream extreme cheesecake and that was way too rich. They do not offer complimentary birthday desserts, but did write Happy Birthday on the cheesecake, put a candle on it and sang to which was nice.  I purchased a $25 giftcard during the Holidays and received two ""slice of joy"" certificates for cheesecakes which was a really good deal considering the cost of cheesecake is around $8. Seems like they run this promo annually.  Prices are moderate but portions are fairly large depending on what you order. Service was really good.

He came to our table and said that hey had nothing of that texture in his restaurant and that perhaps our children had candy at the table that might have gotten into his food. After explaining to him that that was definitely not the case, he insisted that no one in his kitchen would have been chewing gum and that he was dumbfounded at what we found in our the food. He suggested that perhaps it was the packaging plant for the pasta even, anything to avoid taking responsibility for what was clearly the fault of someone in his kitchen. After taking my son's meal off the check, I paid the balance and left in literal disgust. We have eaten many times at this same establishment and cannot believe what we just experienced.

It may take you a while to find parking or some time to get seated but once you're in it'll all be worth it.  They may be famous for their nice and creamy Cheesecake but I must admit the cooks know their way around a bacon cheese burger. That first bite just melts away all cares in the world and your only focus is savoring the flavor of their juicy burger.  Don't even get me started on their Steaks. Regardless of how you like your steaks cooked I would definitely say that you won't be disappointed. Every bite is like a party on your taste buds.  My favorite Cheesecake will have to be the original and of course the Turtle Cheesecake.

Now this isn't saying you can't find your perfect entree among the 20 page menu, I would be impressed if you can't find something you like.  The menu is the standout feature of cheesecake just because there is almost too much to choose from and if you end up getting past their massive entrees, you have two pages of cheesecake flavors to choose from. The cheesecake is also perfect every time. I'm not a big sweets type of guy, but their cheesecake is actually a great way to end a meal.

My potatoes were stiff to the point that my fork kind of stuck. I thought it was pretty cold but said oh well let's try the fish. It was also-cold! Not just like warm, cold. I politely asked the server about this and said it was really cold, no problem, just wanted it hot. He brought it back with a scalding hot plate, and mildly luke fish. Potatoes were Luke, and still the same now reheated old mash. How hard would a new scoop of mash have been? I said no I didn't want anything else as it was late and he said ok, left, and hardly offered a piece of bread. Coming by later, asked again about how things were and I thought really? I just sat and watched my husband eat...you could have offered a cracker! I asked my husband to pay while I spoke to the manager, as I did not want a free meal or coupon, and the manager clearly is not going to do anything other than listen to my gripe. I ordered my cheesecake and went on my way, which again, dissatisfaction. Melted merengue! What a joke. I have never been so insulted and quite frankly have never had to return a dish of food.

It was very good at first but when she got to the middle of the drink it was very unbearable and she had me take a sip. it took everything in me to not spit it out on the table. I asked the server if she could take the drink back because my wife wasn't satisfied. so the the server went to take it back and came back out to see what was so bad about it. while she was inside she told the manage, Kenny, that she didn't like the drink and he came outside to talk to her about it. and asked what was wrong with the drink, proceeded to say that my wife asked him to take it off the bill, which she never said. and then he said that he can't because it was more than half way gone, which it wasn't. and she looked at him saying I never said that, all I wanted was it to be taken back. he said that he will take it off anyways, while he was giving her attitude. so she wanted to leave as we didn't finish our food because he was very rude to her. as he was leaving she asked if we can get to go boxes and as he was walking back in he said under his breath that he isn't going to bring us boxes that he will get someone else to do it because he said that he felt very uncomfortable.  as he approached us in the beginning not asking about our food, I could tell that he already started off on the wrong foot, he was being judgmental to us before the situation occurred because I took my wife out for dinner, which might I add I am also a woman and in a bi-racial relationship. his customer service skills were very poor. on our way home my wife decided to call them and asked to speak to him again. so she could understand what he said to her as he was walking away. and he responded with I felt very uncomfortable, as he interrupted her. and then he said that I am not staying on this phone to argue with you and then he hung up on her.

We were seated right away and the server brought over water and drinks and bread (I love the bread so much here).  We ordered a cheese pizza for our son and I ordered the Chicken Avocado Club while my husband ordered the regular club.  They brought our son's pizza first which I appreciated. More restaurants should do this. Kids aren't patient and they also eat slower from my experience than adults. I took a bite of the pizza and it was very good.  My chicken club arrived and it was ridiculously huge. Three slices of tomato and lots of lettuce. There is no way you can easily eat this without it falling apart. I removed two slices of tomato and most of the lettuce then enjoyed my sandwich. It was good...not great but good. The bread it was on was the highlight of the sandwich (but I'm a bread girl so...). My husband's club was very good but the portions here are known to be huge and this one was the same. After eating a quarter of it he was full. Both sandwiches came with their delicious fries.  This is a great option to get out of the heat and have a nice lunch.

122,A J.,"Leesburg, VA",0,13,1.0,5.0,2017-12-28,"Decided to head out and grab a bite to eat at Cheesecake Factory at the St. John's Town Center in Jacksonville, FL with my daughter and husband.   We were all lucky to get seated at a high top table in the bar area and even luckier when we had an awesome waiter name Anthony aka: Dyre.  We had really good food and service.  My husband and daughter said it was one of the best meals we had at Cheesecake and we are regulars at this location. (Thanks to the cooks in the back, Great Job!) The chocolate milkshake was the best we ever tasted and a really nice portion size. The atmosphere was nice this evening and everyone seemed happy around us!  My family always talks about how customer service is so bad anymore wherever you go, but not here.  We were so happy to get our server Dyre because he was kind, polite, efficient and the bonus.... very handsome.  (My 17 yr old said to say that)  The menu has everything on it for all taste buds and we have always had exceptional service with our wait staff, which says a lot about the management when it comes to picking their top notch employees!   We will definitely be back here for many future meals and great cheesecake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=40,3.36,3.31,3.31,,3.33

101,Jennifer O.,"Jacksonville, FL",187,19,14.0,5.0,2018-01-05,"I am very impressed with this rating, because I normally have to send back any and everything I get from Cheesecake Factory. I decided to give them one more try since I am pretty big on reviews. The herb crusted salmon is so delicious I couldn't even finish the plate. I don't know if you ever heard of the saying, ""the food is good, if you get full pretty fast"" (it's an island ting). That saying was the reflection of my meal. The salmon was juice and well seasoned. The citrus sauce on the plate was extra delicious with a dab of salt and pepper. I recommend everyone try this dish, if you're into seafood.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville,3.28,3.33,3.416,,3.31
97,Virginia M.,"Jacksonville, FL",216,867,301.0,4.0,2018-01-06,"This is one of the OGs of chain restaurants that is still going strong. They have ridiculously high caloric dishes (not including the cheesecake) that are super tasty as well as cocktails. My out of town friends always want to come here despite my suggestions for something more local, but we have a nice time catching up. They do however have a counter where you can order cheesecakes to go, which is a great invention. I found myself wandering around the town center in the cold and thought it would be a good idea to stop in and grab 2 slices of cheesecake, which I may of had 1 for breakfast.  I went with the classic cheesecake with cherry topping. Very delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville,3.24,3.33,3.412,,3.294
100,Brittany O.,"Tampa, FL",64,18,3.0,1.0,2018-01-08,"I ordered a salad with crusted salmon for takeout Saturday night.  My order was prepared with dairy, even after I mentioned I couldn't have any dairy over the phone.  I was told it could be remade, but the wait would take awhile, because they were slammed!  I took my order anyway, had to take the entire piece of salmon out of the salad (because it was covered in dairy) and basically had to eat dressing and lettuce.  I heard great things about their salads before ordering, but was not happy with my experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville,3.24,3.33,3.396,,3.294
94,Kevin D.,"Jacksonville, FL",4,69,32.0,5.0,2018-01-11,"Very good service, friendly fast and accurate! That's a good start! Stopped in for lunch and was surprised by how busy it was. The new restaurants haven't taken a toll on business at Cheesecake- business is still booming. I ordered an appetizer of fried zucchini with ranch dipping sauce. Extraordinary in every way. The zucchini was hot and fresh, and the ranch has a hint of garlic- yum. At $6.50, they are a bargain. They have a new Korean cauliflower app we were excited to try but they were out of it unfortunately. I settled with the Santa Fe salad with chicken, black beans, cheese, corn, tomatoes, fresh cilantro, romaine and tortilla strips. It comes with a cilantro peanut vinaigrette. I'm glad I got it on the side- definitely not to my liking. I opted for more of that yummy garlic ranch and- boom! Outstanding salad! The lunch portion was roughly $12, plenty filling and worth every penny. This was our first trip back in probably three years and we were totally satisfied in every way! I've already recommended many times and will continue to visit. It's a little pricey for lunch but really nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville,3.4,3.33,3.396,,3.358
