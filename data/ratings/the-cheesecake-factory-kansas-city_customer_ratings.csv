109,Charley B.,"Kansas City, KS",113,495,229.0,3.0,2012-01-15,"The Cheesecake Factory is open year around, but I want to begin my synopsis with a holiday time recommendation.  During the holidays when the Plaza lights are on, ask for a seat on the second level by the windows.  Your wait might be a little longer than if you regularly had to wait, but you will enjoy a fantastic view of the Plaza Lights while you enjoy your dinner or your dessert. Okay, now for main review.  Most of the menu features sandwiches, burgers, small pizzas and comfort foods.  None of the dishes are particularly mind blowing, but they are solid meals served in large portions.  You might want to ask for a to-go box.  I particularly like the artichoke and crab dip. After you've boxed up your leftovers please make sure to leave room for dessert.  The cheesecake is amazing.  It comes in plenty of flavors and my favorite is the pineapple upside down concoction. The service is pretty good, but I will say things will slow down during times when the restaurant is at its peak rush.  The restaurant will become busy and there is usually a wait, but luckily there is a nice patio where you can wait until a table opens up.  If you're out and about and looking for dinner or dessert on the Plaza, this is a good place to start.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kansas-city?start=100,3.72,3.72,3.72,3.2760000000000007,3.7200000000000006
135,Angela K.,"Kansas City, MO",161,221,37.0,4.0,2012-01-17,"Depending on when you show up here, it could either be a nightmare to get in or a breeze.  When they first opened...back in the roaring 90s...this was a frequent gathering spot after work.  And it was ALWAYS packed. My last visit was this weekend and we were seated right away by an overly friendly host.  Having not been here in a while, I was surprised at how empty the place was on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.  But I'm not gonna complain about getting seated quickly. The menu, as always, was a novel.  I had a hard time narrowing down my choices.  They have a new ""Skinnylicious"" menu with low-cal options that looked delicious.  Especially the Lettuce Mushroom Wraps.  I was tempted to try the veggie burger, but opted for the comfort of the Four Cheese Pasta.  I was happy that they offered most of their dishes in lunch portions, knowing the gargantuan size of their normal dinner dishes.   The pasta was right on the money.  Tender penne pasta with a creamy tomato sauce.  Just what my belly was looking for.   Service was friendly and attentive without being overbearing.  All in all it was an extremely nice lunch on the Plaza.  And it reminded me how much I really like this place. My visit reminded me how much I love their brunches on Sunday, so I'm definitely going to remember to come here.  The Lemon-Ricotta Pancakes look divine!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kansas-city?start=120,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.3120000000000003,3.76

So I decided to get the Reese's cheesecake because I was in the mood for some peanut butter and it was just peanut butter overload! It was too heavy and rich for me and I should have just stuck to my fave, the Red Velvet cheesecake that is encrusted in white chocolate shavings. There cheesecakes are usually very light, but this Reese's one was just too much! We sat outside since it was a nice day out which I'm really glad we had this option in the Plaza. I wish more Cheesecake Factorys would do this!  Pros: -CHEESECAKE=YUMMY!!! Cons: -none really....I just don't think the food is that spectacular here so oI only come for the cheesecake Why I gave it a 3...... Come for the cheesecake and leave the food behind!

I do not eat the cheesecake here.  I guess I'm a cheesecake snob, but for a place to have it in their name you'd think it would be better than it is.  I have been spoiled by Eli's in Chicago, Claim Jumper's out west, and of course, my own.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kansas-city?start=80,3.64,3.64,3.64,3.248,3.6400000000000006

I ordered a basic omelette that came with three cheeses and lots of veggies. The omelette was thick, hockey-puck like and perfectly round, texture of a sponge. Avocados didn't make it on the plate, the three SLICES of cheese were still hard, unmelted and extremely oily. Mushrooms were burnt.  Wastress spoke so fast that we had to have her repeat everything.

The server was good about being conscientious about the timing. Good job! Since the last time I have been here (who knows how many years??) they have added more items that are smaller sized or lower in calories. That's good but the sheer number of items on the menu is overwhelming. Typical, I chose poorly. I saw a chopped salad that was smaller and lower in calories and it had blue cheese. Sold. It was very flavor-less. Boo. The other people all seemed to really enjoy their choices. No cheesecake was consumed on this visit. Overall, our service was good and, for the most part, our group enjoyed their food. I would say this is a decent place to visit if you have a diverse group that cannot decide on one option.

127,Klent H.,"Wichita, KS",43,67,15.0,2.0,2012-11-20,When in Kansas City I always try to make a stop at the Cheese Cake Factory on the Plaza. This trip was no different with the exception that Sunday brunch was the only time I had available. Expectations were high but I must say I was let down. I arrived with my party at 11:00 and we ordered Bloody Mary's and examined the menu. There were only aout 8 other people in the restaurant but we noticed right away our server seemed distracted and was absent a great deal. She took our orders but the drinks too 15 minuets to arrive and later she brought water and some bread. We kept looking but it appeared she was busy elsewhere.  Our orders took nearly 40 minuets to arrive and the Mexican egg dish I ordered was cold and did not have much flavor. Our server never asked if we wanted another round of drinks and finally brought out our checks. Since we were a group of 6 an 18% gratuity was automatically added which did not set well with our group based on the service we had received.  Everyone in our group was disappointed. It could have just been an off day for the restaurant  crew but  overall  this was not a very satisfactory brunch. We will be back the next time we are in KC but with some apprehension.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kansas-city?start=120,3.6,3.6,3.6,3.0800000000000005,3.6000000000000005

86,Ettya F.,"Boston, MA",307,701,206.0,4.0,2013-01-08,"Once upon a time there lived a girl who resided in Wichita, Kansas. From the time she was just a wee lil' sprout until those awkward teenage years, her parents would cart her to the shopping/food mecca 150 minutes away known as Kansas City - which she would later refer to as KCK thanks to high school debate. What started out as trips to Laura Ashley where she and her mother would walk out in floral jumpsuits, and that little German sweets shop, where she and her father would walk out with chocolate smears on their faces, evolved into more hip outings. She would drag her parents to Abercrombie and insist on eating at that looming restaurant on the corner. The Cheesecake Factory became her favorite restaurant - it's uniqueness unbeknownst to Wichita, and having only visited one other time in Chicago, the demanding 16 year old would insist on ordering multiple baskets of brown, gooey, oaty bread - warm and fresh from the oven. She would scarf down avocado egg rolls - damning the abmoniation that those surely are against her Asian background - sparing not the even the puffy rice noodles adorning the plate. Soft, warm and creamy avocado filling be-speckled with peppers wrapped in delicate, golden brown fried wonton wrappers - surely these were health food that would not disrupt her teenage diet. And to cap off a meal, she would indulge - depending on the season - in either a chocolate peanut butter cookie dough cheesecake (which she now bemoans the loss of and didn't/still doesn't give a hoot about the inevitable hives that would accompany that luscious histamine inducing dessert) or her favorite dessert of all time: the White Chocolate Peppermint Bark cheesecake that would debut only in the holiday season.  Not much has changed: instead of engorging in all 8 half eggrolls solo, she now shares these with her kinfolk - ordering, instead, some raw tuna piled atop avocado and served with four delicately fried wonton chips (Ahi Tartare). But somehow she manages to lick clean the luscious mashed potatoes adorning her father's plate and the sweet potato fries served with her aunt's beautiful burger. These, she declares, are sweet potato fry perfection. Chain restaurants have the advantage of millions of tasters, and thanks to that, those fries rule...when dipped in honey mustard dressing. And once a year, she insists...ABSOLUTELY DEMANDS that she get her White Chocolate Peppermint Bark cheesecake, a red peppermint dotted cake with a white chocolate topping that sits upon a dense brownie bottom...and please, serve this with hot fudge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kansas-city?start=80,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.3120000000000003,3.5600000000000005

The wait was long, as usual, but once we were seated we got the same awesome service and tasty food Cheesecake Factory is known for. There were four people in my group and I can't remember what everyone ordered, but I got the crab hash. There were too many onions or something I wasn't crazy about, but the combination of the hollandaise and crab and hash brown was so good! My husband and I also each ordered a cheesecake to take home and both were delicious. I have probably only tried three or four of their cheesecakes ever, but they are consistently very good, probably even better than the food. Caramel is my weakness so I ordered the dulce de leche cheesecake and it was freaking amazing. Even my husband, who doesn't care for caramel, ended up eating half of it.

We went on a Thursday night around 6:30 and there was no wait. The staff was friendly and the service was good. It was a little loud (echo and the music was too loud). I really liked my food. I had the Carlton Salad, which I thought was divine, and the Tiramisu Cheesecake; which I wanted to marry because it was that good.

Arrival and Ambience:  Like every other CF, this location is beautifully maintained. Impeccably clean, even on a rainy night. We went on a Friday evening and got immediate service. We sat at a booth by the window.  Service:  Waitress seemed really 'green'. Wasn't sure if she was new or having an off day. She didn't visit us regularly and forgot a few things. Cute, sweet lil girl though.  Food:  This is the stingiest portioned Cheesecake Factory in terms of bread. Every one that I usually visit gives you 3 loaves of bread, and this one only gives you 2 --- and they are so small in comparison to other locations. Were the grains on strike in the kitchen? I need answers.  I ordered the pizza... and it was large, fresh and delicious. Crust was on point. The heartburn was worth it.  Drank lemonade... tart and delicious as usual.  Got the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake. Delicious but couldn't finish it all.  I LOVED the atmosphere though.

159,Ashley C.,"Lee's Summit, MO",3,20,2.0,3.0,2013-06-06,"First I will tell the reason it got three stars: The food quality and taste are phenomenal!! That alone got three stars. Unfortunately, there is one big reason I probably won't be going back of my own volition: Prices and portions. I had not been to the factory in many years remembering that the meal portions were gargantuan and the food often over-cooked (especially chicken). I went as part of a bachelorette party.  First, they refused to take a reservation, even for a group as large as us, so we had to sit and wait for nearly two hours outside in the rain, because they do not have an indoor waiting area. Then, being on a bit of a budget and remembering those enormous portion sizes, I went for the small plates. The waitress confirmed that two small plates was perfect for a meal. Wrong! These were not small plates. They were baby plates! I had the ahi tare tare and the mushroom/zucchini/avocado fries. Those put together would equal a standard appetizer in your typical restaurant. No where near a full meal. Nonetheless, I had spent all I had allotted for my meal so I ordered cheesecake. I didn't have a menu in front of me to know that it was nearly $10 for one slice!!! I could understand that if they made it all fresh in house, but they don't! Then add to it the fact that my ""skinny"" margarita (150 calories or less) cost as much as the cheesecake! I could have bought two standard margaritas at the bar we would be heading two for the same price (still in down town KC). Then it came time for the bills. Several from our party asked to take pieces of the brides check. The waitress fumbled orally for a minute then just announced that she would figure it out and left, declaring she was smart enough. Well, that wasn't entirely true. I ended up with part of the bride's faire, and everyone else declared their checks correct and handed over their money before I even figured out why mine was so ding dong expensive. I ended up paying for a $12 dollar drink I didn't even get to taste (most expensive thing on my bill) and have gratuity included already. All in all, the food is fantastic, but you better be willing to empty your bank account if you do anything but nibble at this place. Thank God I got to bring my cheesecake home cuz with the amount of money I dropped there, I should have had a whole meal waiting for me in the fridge! Great food.

Second, I wish there had been less chicken and rice and more veggies. There were some veggies, but not as much as was needed to call it a side. The chicken was very high in calories and the chicken had too much batter on it. I was literally taking huge bites of batter when it should have been chicken. The Cheesecake Factory advertises it as Orange chicken, but when I was eating the chicken I could not taste the citrusy taste that comes with oranges.

Instead of waiting, we decided to wander upstairs to the bar area to see if we could snag an open high-top table (first-come, first-served).  Getting upstairs proved to be an adventure as we had to climb over hordes of people who were seated on both sides of the stairway waiting for their name to be called.  When we finally reached the top, we were in luck - there was a table just getting up from their meal, so we quickly grabbed it and took a seat. Now for the actual dining experience.  Have I mentioned yet that I've never been a fan of Cheesecake Factory?  They have one of the most overwhelming menus that I've ever seen in my life.  I swear it's 20-something pages long, with every type of food imaginable represented.  Personally, I'd prefer them to pick one or two types of cuisine, perfect those, and get rid of the rest.  But nobody asked me, so I had a decision to make.  Not really in the mood for anything in particular, I decided to order the Cajun Chicken Pasta.  My wife ordered some type of salad.  When the food arrived, I immediately thought to myself, ""Wow... this is why the obesity rate in America continues to rise.""  My oversized plate was full of pasta, which was drenched in an oil (or butter)-based sauce and topped with 4 pieces of breaded chicken.  The taste was fabulous, but I couldn't even finish half of it, and I wasn't about to try because I knew I had to save room for the best part of the meal - the CHEESECAKE, which as always was delicious. All-in-all, our visit really wasn't all that bad.  We didn't end up having to wait for a table, our service was very good, and the food exceeded my expectations.  I just wouldn't choose to come here on a regular basis and battle the crowds when there are all sorts of other great dining options available in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kansas-city?start=100,3.4,3.4,3.4,3.0840000000000005,3.4000000000000004

I've been to both KC locations numerous times, and my wife and I typically split an entree (usually the orange chicken). The portion sizes are such that you can get two full meals out of one entree. Maybe not the burgers, but most of the $16-20 items. The cheesecake is also delicious. I'm a big fan of the pineapple upside down cheesecake. The Plaza location is a little cramped and super busy. If you'd like a Friday/Saturday night cheesecake fix, I'd recommend the Overland Park location. It is laid out better, and you aren't packed in like sardines while waiting for a table. My favorite time to go to the Plaza location is on a nice warm day for Sunday brunch and get a table outside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kansas-city?start=60,3.6,3.6,3.6,3.12,3.6000000000000005

104,Melissa A.,"Kansas City, MO",4,5,,2.0,2015-04-16,"I was here about a week ago and had a really tough time being satisfied when I finally walked out the door. I don't eat here often, but met some friends this week for a birthday dinner. The food was good, but the poor waiter was over-extended having several large tables at the same time. But, that wasn't why I was so disappointed. Mostly, I had a the toughest time with the host stand. I had arrived first because out of my friends that were coming, I live the closest. This normally isn't a problem because I am usually just sat at our table and allowed to wait. NOT THE CASE HERE!! When I got to the front of the mass of people in the restaurant, after mentioning that there would be six of us I was promptly told that I had to wait until at least three people from our party were present before I could be put at a table. I have never heard of this before... Really? Being willing to be patient I accept their answer and took my buzzer and sat down. Well, when it became clear that my friends were running late due to traffic and an accident on the highway, I thought maybe they would make an exception and let me sit at a table. I was wrong. Not only did I get the feeling that I didn't matter to them because I was just one person, but they continued to give tables to fit the size of our party to other people and when my friends finally arrived we still had to wait an additional half hour to be seated! So a customer that got to a ""first come first serve type restaurant"" got shoved to the side and made to wait over an hour and a half before getting a table. This ""there must be half of your party present"" idea does not make for a good customer experience. Whether you are super-busy or not, EVERY customer should be made to feel important. I'm pretty sure the next time someone asks me to come to the Cheesecake Factory on a weekend, I am going to politely decline!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kansas-city?start=100,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.9200000000000004,3.4800000000000004

I had the eggplant parmigiana and it was delicious. My boyfriend had the chicken and biscuits and he really enjoyed it. The prices for entrees are just a bit high, but where they get you are the appetizers and the alcohol. We didn't order appetizers because we thought they were just too overpriced. My boyfriend had a Long Island iced tea and it was $10 and change and that wasn't even for the top shelf. We got 3 slices of cheesecake to take home and share.

Lunch on Monday was Sis' treat and so the choice was hers.  I had a very good and extremely filling selection from the SKINNYLICIOUS® menu.  I chose the Chicken Salad Sandwich with a side salad dressed with Balsamic dressing.  The greens were plentiful and a nice Spring mix with absolutely no iceberg in sight.  The housemade chicken salad included Roasted Almonds, Lettuce, Tomato and Mayonnaise and was served on Toasted Brioche Bread that really made the sandwich something special.  Sis also ordered from the Skinnylicious menu and got a Hamburger on a Toasted Bun with Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Pickles and Mayonnaise which is also served with a Green Salad.  Neither of us had room for dessert, which was disappointing, as luscious looking cheesecake slices as well as other goodies kept whizzing by our table for delivery to all our dining neighbors (who had planned their eating and drinking more judiciously -- or else they just waddled out of the restaurant, I'm not sure which).  We arrived at about 1:15 and after a five minute wait were seated.  To correspond with my recollections of past visits, the noise level made it difficult to carry on conversation and I remembered why I tend to avoid the experience.  But the service was very efficient and the food was quite good, so I balanced the pros and cons to a solid 3-star rating.  The Cheesecake Factory is never going to be a favorite for me, but it is obviously a winner with hundreds of customers every single day, so they must be doing something ""Right"".  And maybe I'll make another visit in about five years and remember to ""Save room for some Cheesecake"" when I go. PS: Thanks again for lunch, Sis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kansas-city?start=40,3.44,3.54,3.54,3.2120000000000006,3.5000000000000004

I informed her it was just myself, and she looked at me like I was crazy and asked if I was sure I didn't have a party of 6. Yep, pretty sure it's just me... Ended up there was a mix up at the hostess stand; they paged the wrong buzzer. Then the three ladies at the hostess stand basically started arguing in front of me and other guests about their mix up.  I ended up getting taken to a different table and sat down. Shortly after the server came by, but offered no greeting. The first words out of his mouth were ""you need to give me a few minutes to get caught up"". WOW! There are more tactful ways to address a waiting guest, such as ""hi, how are you? I'll be with you shortly"".

This year, we landed at Cheesecake Factory for the aforementioned meal. Yes, I know that CF on a holiday weekend is slightly ill-advised, but we had a giftcard, and with kids in tow, you just can't go wrong with their mega-menu. We thought we'd beat the rush by arriving at 4:45.  We thought, ""Oh, maybe we'll wait a few minutes, but surely we'll miss the 2-3 hour wait."" Dead wrong. Name went in at 4:45.  We were told it would be a 90 minute wait.  Ugggh.  Will the kids make it?  Should we go somewhere else?  Ehh, by the time we walk 15 minutes back to the car, drive 10-30 minutes somewhere else, undoubtedly wait a few minutes there...we might as well have stayed.  So we did. After an hour and forty minutes, I went to check up on where we were at within the line.   ""It'll be about another 25 minutes."" Double uggggghhh. Forty-five minutes later, our buzzer buzzed and we were shown to a (windowless) table by the kitchen.  But, by that time, we were ready to eat eight-day old garbage within a dirty, third-world ghetto, so it didn't really matter.  And, also, we found great ""seats"" (window sills) inside, upstairs, outside the bathrooms that we sat at for about half our wait.  The view was Plaza-Christmas-tastic! The food was as the food is at Cheesecake Factory - solid.  As it should be, the namesake dessert was F A N T A S T I C.  I can't recall the exact name, but lots of Nutella and hazelnuts were involved. Table service was just slightly under-average for Cheesecake Factory, but the dude said he had been working since open, which would have had him there well-past a normal shift.  A little goofy, but still attentive, helpful, and half-way charming...in a sleepy way. Were it not for the grossly inaccurate estimates for wait times (for which I've docked them on ""Service"" below), the overall for this location would have scored a bit better.  I'll make sure to provide an updated review next time we're in on a non-holiday weekend to give ol' CF a fair shake.

Well this location had no problems with serving our party of 10. Even after having our waitress come back several time to take our orders & continues to have later people needing to be added to our tables the waitress didn't miss a beat.  I can really appreciate how well organized & knowledgeable of the menu she was. There were several people who asked for her opinion on what to get & they we all happy with their selections. I ordered the crab cake balls & they came out excellent.  They were served with a lemon sauce & I didn't know how that would taste with them but the waitress assured me that they were good. When is got the balls they were crunchy on the outside & moist on the inside. The flavor was well seasoned but had a little bit too much breading for my liking but I still ate them!

71,anthony l.,"Topeka, KS",37,33,3.0,3.0,2017-01-02,We went to Kansas City tonight for something different to do and go to one of our favorite places to eat. Well we got seated pretty quick which was great but it took a little long to get our supper but I understand it was busy. But my daughter ordered the salmon dinner and we had to send it back because it was raw and it took another 30 minutes to get it back in which my daughter lost interest in it. So that was disappointing. None the less the waitress kept telling us it was just a few minutes away well that was not true. All I suggest is that the manager should of come over to apologize for the inconvenience and what was disturbing was the still charged me for it. You know it's not our fault the cook didn't do his job properly. It's amazing how we expect so many things to be perfect and we get disappointed when it doesn't go over well. I hope I get some feedback so I can feel like I can go back someday.

After eating at the Cheesecake Factory during my travels to California and elsewhere I almost swore off this restaurant for good.

Food - 5 To start with the best, the food here is pretty good. I've only been here twice, but on both occasions me and my companions have enjoyed the food here. Portions are large and dishes are tasty. They have a tremendous variety so it's good for those that don't know what they want or if you have many different tastes in the party. However, the menu can also be overwhelming. Cheesecakes are super tasty. Drinks are good as well. I do hate that they don't put prices on both.  Service - 3 Again, both times i have been disappointed with the service. They don't take reservations so you will usually wait if you come on a busy day. Our wait wasn't long (2-5) minutes, but expect up to 60 minute wait during very busy evenings. The service is very slow (probably the kitchen and not the servers themselves). No  matter, we waited for our food for way too long. Each time the servers apologized, but that doesn't do much and seems like a common occurrence. The servers are friendly despite being very busy.   Atmosphere - 4 The decor is all over the place, but it isn't bad, it just doesn't have a very uniform theme. Outside (when it's not hot) the setting is really nice, next to the fountains. Value/Price - 3.5 While the food is tasty and portions are great the service is negative due to long waits and propensity to get things wrong. The atmosphere is relatively neutral. Prices are above my expectations, but not totally out whack with the area. I hate that they don't put prices on cheesecakes and drinks. Drinks range at around $12.

This trip, though, was bizarre. The guy working the host counter was a bit creepy and gave off a pedo vibe. Unkempt and stared at everyone. Our waitress was pleasant but not very smart. Her timing was also incredibly off. She interpreted ""give me a minute to look at the menu"" as ""neglect us for 20 minutes without even bringing the drinks already ordered."" When the food was finally delivered by someone else, our server decided to come up from right behind the other server before we even took a bite and ask ""how is everything tasting?"" Can we have ten seconds?  Leftovers were stuffed into a tiny box which leaked all over by the time we got home. She got us two pieces of cheesecakes to go in two separate small containers... now we have three separate (tiny) boxes in three separate smaller plastic bags. Apparently, it would take too long for her to get a bigger bag to consolidate everything, so we walked up to the cheesecake counter ourselves and got a large bag within two seconds.

I got Skinnylicious Chicken Enchiladas and let me tell you they are to die for!! Now for the thing you have been waiting for: the cheesecakes. They are also to die for. There are so many different flavors that you can choose from. There are fruit flavors and chocolate flavors and crazy flavors and original flavors, I could go on and on. My favorite is the Reese's Peanut Putter Cup Cheesecake. If you like peanut butter, chocolate and cheesecake you will love this one! That being said, they are all good. This time though I got the Peppermint Bark Cheesecake. It was fabulously good. It has candy canes inside it too!! This place is the best. I would totally recommend going here for any meal (except breakfast).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kansas-city,2.84,3.4,3.4,,3.176
17,Bailey T.,"Phoenix, AZ",80,1,,1.0,2017-12-05,"My issue tonight was not with the food, my cheesecake taste wonderful as always. The service tonight was absolutely horrendous. I only ordered a piece of cheesecake to go, so I can't say anything about the dining service, although I'm sure it was less than superior due to the fact that 6 of the waiters and waitresses were huddled around the cheesecake counter talking and joking around with each other. Shoving each other, hitting each other and very obviously flirting (which was incredibly cringe worthy.) Instead of interrupting their party I decided to wait and observe,  It took a good 2 and a half minutes for anyone to notice me standing at the counter. Which I can understand on a busy night, but not when I am the only one waiting in the front area. I ordered my cheesecake, and was told ""give us a few minutes."" A few minutes? I am the only one in line and clearly see 2 giant cheesecakes (so they didn't have to make another one or anything.) After 2 minutes of watching the employees continue to talk and mess with each other, I started looking at my phone. It only took another minute for me to be rudely interrupted by the behind the counter employee yelling ""HELLO!"" to my face multiple times to get my attention, and dangling my cheesecake off her finger. I grabbed my cheesecake and abruptly left. Unbelievable service. I will not be visiting this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kansas-city?start=20,2.76,3.37,3.37,,3.126
22,Lauren M.,"Mission, KS",62,150,2.0,1.0,2017-12-09,"They don't take reservations, so our party of 10 came on a Saturday around 2:45. We knew we'd have to wait, and the hostess said an hour and fifteen to an hour an forty five. It took about an hour and fifteen. We were sat and we were close to the door and with the line out the door most of the time, the chilly air plagued us most of the meal. We froze, but were pretty hungry due to being there for a while. I liked my Romano chicken. The chicken itself was tasty, but the pasta was a bit bland. We had an amazing server that kept up with us. He was friendly and very professional. I feel I've consistently had mediocre, non-memorable experiences here. The whole time we were eating, more and more people crammed around us, causing an unpleasant atmosphere to eat in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kansas-city,2.76,3.34,3.34,,3.108
16,Kim M.,"Shawnee, KS",7,2,,2.0,2017-12-10,"Got there at 245pm to eat dinner. They won't take reservations. We had a party of 8 adults, 1 child, 1 baby. We were told 1hr 15 min to 1hr 45 min wait. They clearly don't like and can barely handle large parties and should have said so. Jack Stack last year had no problem. It took the entire 1 hr 45min (of course). The entire restaurant was packed with people standing and sitting on the steps, standing around the tables where we were eating, the entire lobby was full etc. Most likely some fire codes were being broken and definitely some safety rules for blocking safety exits. The food was ok, but barely warm and placed on a hot plate. Brought me the wrong glass of wine to top it off. Cheesecake was delish though. Do not plan a holiday gathering here or you will be disappointed. Severely mismanaged. If you can't handle large parties  just say so and we can go to another restaurant that can. Or, how about a new idea....RESERVATIONS for large parties. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kansas-city?start=20,2.64,3.31,3.31,,3.042
2,Sefika M.,"Kansas City, MO",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-11,Decided to go to this restaurant for my birthday to celebrate. After looking through the menu for 20 minutes not a single server came to my table. I was not even offered water. This is terrible service and don't expect to be coming back anytime in the future when the server was more focused on holding side conversations with others.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kansas-city?start=20,2.64,3.28,3.28,,3.0240000000000005
23,Patricia R.,"Kansas City, MO",184,5,1.0,1.0,2017-12-20,"Wow, really bad service tonight. Followed the instructions on the website for Curbside to go. Stated during the order it was for Curbside to go. Arrive at the Plaza location band cannot find designated parking, so call the restaurant to ask where they were. Were then told, uh, we don't like take food outside. Ok, go inside to pick up our order and stood, ignored for 4 minutes (yes we times it, at this point, why not?) Treated very rudely by staff once someone came over to the to go counter.  Not happy, and probably not returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kansas-city,2.52,3.26,3.26,,2.9640000000000004
33,C H.,"Overland Park, KS",6,4,,5.0,2017-12-22,"Our food was excellent today for lunch. The service was great. Want to give a special hand to our waiter, Corey R. He has been the best waiter by far at any restaurant in a long time. Attentive, anticipated what we wanted before we asked, genuine. Made lunch so enjoyable. He's a keeper. We had two kids with us and he took the effort to engage them. Everyone of the wait staff were on their game today!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kansas-city,2.52,3.29,3.29,,2.9819999999999998
24,Katie S.,"Kansas City, MO",4,1,1.0,5.0,2018-01-04,Every time I have gone to The Cheesecake Factory I always get something different. This last time I went (1/1/18) I tried the Chicken Bellagio. It is now my favorite dish & will definitely get it next time I go. Our server was very friendly and informative about the menu. I will definitely try to go back more!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kansas-city,2.6,3.29,3.29,,3.014
21,Eric G.,"Kansas City, MO",20,108,102.0,3.0,2018-01-07,"My wife and I have been coming to cheesecake factory for many new year eves. The menu is extensive and the food is pretty good but a little expensive. Service has been good every time but was disappointed this past new years. They did pass out champaign but no party favors. No biggie but that's part of why we go every year. So! If you want cheese cake, yes this is the place to go. If you want a fancy dining experience, head on over. Good selection of great tasting food and good service...yes. There will always be a place in my stomach for the cheesecake factory but it's only for cheesecake and/or new years eve celebrations. If you haven't been and want a fancy dinner...I'd recommend it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kansas-city,2.6,3.27,3.27,,3.002
