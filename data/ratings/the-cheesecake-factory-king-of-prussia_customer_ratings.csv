But it's not just the cheesecakes that are fabulous- it's EVERYTHING. They have such a wide range of entrees- Asian cuisine, Burgers, Italian, Mexican, you name it. Its all fabulous. Even the Tropical Tea is to die for. I can't think of anything negative about any of my experiences here, besides maybe the wait for a table. It's annoying that they don't take reservations. But my solution to that issue is to just come at the off hours. You'll be busy shopping at the mall anyway, so come at your leisure. Like or between lunch and dinner (3 or 4:00). Just forget Friday/Saturday nights unless you're doing takeout or are willing to wait around 1.5 hours. Also, the meals are very high in caloric content so be prepared to workout for a couple days afterwards if you want your pants to fit haha.

289,Tina C.,"Reading, PA",193,161,7.0,4.0,2012-04-11,I really enjoy the Cheesecake Factory. People say its overrated and overpriced but I really disagree. I think the food is great and it is always a good time!  Servers are areally on top of their game too. Very helpful and very knowledgeable on the menu. They give you plenty of food so you will always have lunch the next day! Portions are great for what your paying. I love the turkey club sandwich and the dynamite (i think thats what its called?) shrimp! Very tasty! The vanilla bean cheesecake is to die for and so is the strawberry infused vodka martini.  Definitely try it out! Very good.

I think cheesecake factory is a great chain that never disappoints but this one is in dire need of allowing people to make reservations to fix the mess outside of it.

My server, Ellen, was so kind and knowledgeable about every dish to which I enquired. She was so attentive and delivered every comment with a smile that made me feel like the most important customer she had all night. She recommend dessert and helped me decide which one I would like best. Her service was so refreshing and rare. Since I travel a lot, I have great experience with dining out. Ellen must truly be an asset to the Cheesecake Factory organization. The only way she could have made my experience better would be if she had sat down and had dinner with me.

230,Richard K.,"Philadelphia, PA",2,218,1125.0,3.0,2012-08-04,"It's been awhile since I visited the Cheesecake Factory, and now I remember why.  There's nothing particularly wrong with this restaurant chain.  It has a Disney-esque decor and ambiance, and it has a a good staff (Dijana, our server was enthusiastic to the point of being perky, efficient, and helpful: very professional) and good food, BUT, in the end, it feels more like an amp'd up version of Appleby's or TGIF. As I mentioned already, the food is good, but not great.  As Gordon Ramsay would likely point out, it has too many items on the menu, trying to provide something for everybody, so nothing I've eaten at this restaurant chain has been memorable in my mind.  Case in point:  I had Jambalaya with linguini this evening: an interesting twist, but the linguini came out too wet and mushy, having been drenched in the Jambalaya sauce too long.  It was good and acceptable, but not something I would have paid ~$17 in retrospect.  I asked for an extra dry Grey Goose martini with extra olives:  I only got three (not four or five as I would have received at other restaurants). And of course, the biggest problem for me: they don't take reservations.  Perhaps, they do this to purposefully create a crowd swarming inside and outside the restaurant, i.e., to create a buzz, to inflate the anticipation of the waiting clientale, but it does not work for me.  I hate having to wait among the throngs of people outside, and I hate the crowd of people milling around inside the restaurant. Why did I come here this evening?  My kids still enjoy it, and they certainly love the cheesecake.  Perhaps, it's the thing to do after spending the day at the mall;, e.g., it's more about the entertainment, rather than the culinary, experience.  As long as you recognize and understand what you're paying for, it's OK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-king-of-prussia?start=220,3.64,3.64,3.64,3.1480000000000006,3.6400000000000006

192,John K.,"Philadelphia, PA",259,573,3539.0,5.0,2012-08-26,Sure ... it's a chain. Sure it can be considered 'family restaurant.'  Sure doesn't mean it skimps on quality .. and certainly not quantity!  The nostalgia this place brings is second to none (think college dinners funded by friends' parents).  In any case - you always start off with sourdough and honey wheat bread. Wish the butter was soft or at room temp - but they keep it chilled. The bread is usually warmed and fresh 'enough.' Doesn't stop me from usually getting a refill. But the refills do pose a problem ... there is never enough room for the rest of the food!  Start off with Avocado Eggrolls (yum - creamy avocado ... roasted peppers ... crunchy wanton wrapper). I've eaten 20 of these in one sitting when I once had Cheesecake Factory catering ... no joke. Or choose the crispy crab wantons - you just can't go wrong. From there - the problem is that everything for your mains is so good. And my own personal problem is that I can usually never deviate from: 1) Farfalle with Garlic Cream Sauce - Chicken - Pancetta - Peas - Mushrooms. Delicious - creamy - succulent.  2) Louisiana Chicken Pasta - spicy - creamy - chicken - all colors of bell peppers - fried chicken cutlets (4 for the dinner portion!) 3) Burger - they're all delicious!  4) Cheesecake - Red Velvet for the GF does wonders ... Tuxedo Mousse hits the spot for me!  Even I can't finish the food here.

I've always heard such bad things about this place and I feel like every time I read another ""worst food in America"" article, a dish from this place is on the top of the list. So, honestly, I was expecting a kind of redneck joint with tons of greasy fried foods and nothing but unhealthy, gross options. But I was surprised to see that even though it's got a chain-like decor and ridiculously large menu, it wasn't half bad. They have great selections on their ""skinny"" menu. The chicken tacos were actually amazing -- the ingredients were super fresh and the flavor was just right. And I think for something like 500 calories and $10, you get three good-sized tacos and a big thing of rice. Definitely a good value and calorie count. (I've seen the 2,500+ calorie monstrosities they have in here, stay away!) The edamame was really good too. And what other reason to eat a healthy dinner but to save room for dessert? I mean, it IS the CHEESECAKE Factory, after all. Thank God my brother and his wife and I shared a piece -- they are huge! I think I seriously have dreams about the Godiva slice. Good lord. A woman's dream. Overall, a decent place to come if you're in the mall or close to it and you've got people with different tastes since the menu is so huge. But be prepared for a long wait.

For appetizers, we had Fried Mac and Cheese.  Oh yeah, it trumps a healthier Mac and Cheese dish because you're just having a morsel, it's not the main course.  Don't go too overboard even though they only give you four...the balls are HUGE... ...and that's what she said XD.   Anywho, had the Crispy Chicken Costoletta.  So NOT the most lavishing and complicated dish on the menu.  In fact, it's one of the least lavishing and complicated.  GOOD, because it was done very well for my palate, and I enjoyed every bite of it.  I remember the last time I was at the same Cheesecake Factory - I had a salad, and, let me tell you, I got LOST in the flavors.  I am one to always try and finish salads at a restaurants, because they get watery when you take the leftovers home.  It's by personal preference, but I did not prefer the huge portions.

But the menu is extensive. You could go there everyday for a year and not order the same thing twice. I love their salads. They are huge ( even the lunch portions). I always get the Santa Fe  salad. It was chicken, beans, corn, tomatoes, tort strips, cilantro, and mixed with cilantro lime dressing and drizzled with a peanut sauce. To.die.for. when I'm watching the calories I order from their skinnylicious menu. The beet and goat cheese salad is divine and I'll pair that with one of their skinny taco options.

There were three of us and we were able to get seated right away at 5 pm. I have to say this is rare as there is usually a wait, but I guess because it was nice outside, people were down the shore or grilling.  Of the 25 or so times I've been to Cheesecake, I only had one dish I really did not like (the breakfast burrito for brunch one morning). I usually order the same dish, Chicken Costoletta, and it is delicious every time. The portion size is always enough to have dinner the following night and the price is beyond reasonable for the amount of food you get. I tried the blue cheese and pear flat bread this past trip and while the flat bread could have had a little bit more topping on it, overall it was not bad for $4.95. The cheesecake is always huge and delicious. I normally don't get cheesecake but was in the mood for something sweet. My boyfriend and I shared the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake (to go), and it was divine. I only ate about 1/3 of it as it was more than enough to satisfy my sweet tooth. I definitely recommend sharing the cheesecake with 1-2 people as it is way to much for 1 person to eat. I recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a quick sit-down meal without a lot of privacy. The restaurant is usually loud and crowded and the tables are on top of one another (unless you're lucky enough to get a booth).

Their menu has a huge selection and I could easily eat here everyday, but sadly, I'd be as big as the restaurant in no time! Fortunately, they do now have their skinny menu and most of the time, I just order off of that menu. The meals are 590 or less calories and still very flavorful. Although portion sizes are smaller than off their normal menu, you likely won't walk out hungry. That's because the portion sizes off of their regular menu is ridiculous! I really like the various Mexican dishes that they have here and often go with the chicken enchiladas.  For starters, we really like the taquitos. We've had several of their cheesecakes but our favorites are the vanilla bean and the Snickers, although I'm looking forward to trying their new S'mores coming later this month!!  Service has always been good. Downside is that this place is always packed and they do not take reservations or do call ahead seating.

The rest of the icing tastes like the generic plain white variety. (There are 10+ cheesecakes that are chocolate/chocolate cake-based; the reason why I ordered the Red Velvet is because it's the /one/ with cream cheese icing.) Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake - 5 out of 5 Amazing. There are so many different flavors  and textures at work: Oreo cookies baked into the creamy cheesecake add a nice textural contrast, pillowy fudge cake that tastes like the cocoa-y cookie, Oreo mousse, milk chocolate icing that teeters on too sweet, and garnished with the familiar crunch of freshly-crumbled Oreos. Dutch Caramel Apple Streusel Cheesecake - 4.5 out of 5 This cake is a cross between a luscious cheesecake and the best apple crumble ever, which is a winning combination in my book. Key Lime Cheesecake - 4.5 out of 5 This cake has a very pronounced tart flavor that cuts the richness of the cake. Every bite is increasingly addictive and leaves you wanting more. The sweetness enrobes the tip of your tongue and the creaminess captures all of your taste buds, leaving the faint taint of fresh lime and tartness to refresh your palate. The macaroon crust is a nice departure from the pedestrian graham cracker. Pineapple Upside-Down Cheesecake - 2 out of 5 I'd hoped that this would be my favorite cheesecake, but it was quite disappointing as it tasted too artificial.

The service can be downright mediocre, but sometimes it is exemplary.  One other negative is that the chicken that they serve with pasta, is with bone-in. When I order pasta, I'd rather have use my utensils only and not have to work my way around a bone. It's essentially the same thing as shrimp having their tails on.

Brainfreeze inducing goodness!). It's a pretty amazing tradition. Our plan of attack is to share small plates, get a light entree and, of course, end with a hunk o' burning cheesecake. On this particular trip, we shared stuffed mushrooms (cheesy and delicious), sweet corn tamale cakes (absolutely amazing. Get this.), and crab bites (crispy on the outside, but a little mushy on the inside. Still yummy.). For my entree, I got the pear and endive salad. It was really good, the dressing was deliciously tangy. The pears were cooked, though. I think it would have been better with crisp, fresh pears. For my dessert, I got the Kahlua cheesecake. IT. IS. TO. DIE. FOR. It has a brownie base and.. oh, man. It's so good. Actually, writing this made me remember that I had some left over. I left my computer to go to the refrigerator to steal a bite. Yep, that good. Our server was a really nice, sweet girl. It was crazy busy in there but she never left us waiting for anything.

Essentially the very last store in the mall, the Cheesecake Factory provides a great embiance and environment for a family meal or date.  That is, if you can ensure waiting the customary 30 minutes to 2 hours to be seated. With the exception of opening hours, you can expect to wait in order to be seated. The layout of the restaurant gives the appearance that it is incredibly large, but this leads to the deception you may encounter during your visit.  The restaurant is deep in size, but incredibly narrow. This narrow design means you are forced to interact with the wait staff as they attempt to maneuver around you with other patrons' platters. Despite these handicaps, the service is expediant and the customer service is excellent. In my humble greedy opinion, the food is great and the pallette is large enough for everyone in your party.

They are caloric nightmares and have tons of fat. Cheesecake is also very secretive about their stats and only ever have them up when laws forced them too.  Skinnylicious menu is where it's at but you still need to be carful there because they can be up to 600 calories.  I usually get the tuna carpaccio as my enter and enjoy it with a few prices of bread. It is large thin slice raw tuna with avocado and a delicious soy based sauce. Their pumpernickel bread is warm and amazing and a great accompaniment for a lunch under 400 calories.

The woman at the desk said tables were available outdoors currently or it would be a forty-minute wait for indoor seating. Not a fan of car exhaust mingling with our cheesecake, we opted to wait.  After thirty minutes of watching mall weirdos, the pager buzzed. We handed over our pager, and then a small piece of paper was put in the holder ... which was apparently the next part of the waiting game. When our name was called, they announced the wrong party-size AND proudly announced the our OUTSIDE table was ready. I quietly corrected the server on the party size and location. Thus ensued a conversation between this woman and the one behind the desk ... WHO THEN TORE UP THE SLIP OF PAPER WITH OUR NAME AND GAVE US ANOTHER PAGER AND TOLD US TO WAIT AGAIN. Had it not been for one member of our party begging us to stay (because he didn't have the will to seek another place), I would have snapped that pager in half and shoved it in the cushions of the leather chairs over by Urban Outfitters (I rehearsed this in my mind many times).  When the pager went off the second time, we silently handed it back in (in one piece, against my better judgement). The little slip of paper was again put in the holder ... where we stood again (it's like something out of the absurdest film Brazil). A new server, came for our party AND ANNOUNCED THE WRONG SIZE AGAIN. I corrected him. We all sat down at a booth and the server THEN brought over ONE fewer menus ... saying he was confused.

I got the crab cake bites and they were all dough (big disappointment). My boyfriend got the cheese garlic bread and definitely was not worth $9. He was not a fan, I didn't have an opinion either way. When he he told the waitress he wasn't fond of it and it wasn't what he thought it would be, our waitress did not offer him something else.

Holy shit.  So our food arrives. My pasta is undercooked and still starchy/paste-y and it was a good size portion. I also added shrimp for a six dollar up charge. His steak was ok. Nothing great.

Couldn't we cut back on a few menu pages and skip the ads?  It shouldn't feel like I am reading a magazine - it is a menu!  And everything is in the menu - pages of drinks, pages of lunch items, pages of appetizers, etc.  It just goes on and on.   Drinks were good, service was timed nicely.  But the food - it was okay - but the portions are too large - waaaay too large!  My chicken Marsala was enough for three large meals.  And while it had mushrooms, it would be nice if it was served with a vegetable.  I received a platter of pasta, chicken, and mushrooms (and a stick of parsley that was all stem and one leaf).  Some steamed broccoli or green beans would have been nice visually as well as to balance out the meal.  Needless to say, we had leftovers to take home. We took home some cheesecake...do they really think that after eating such a huge portion of food that people will have room for dessert?? But the cheesecake was very nice.  The Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake had too much whipped layer and not enough cheesecake, but still overall it was a nice chocolate dessert. I think that in the future, if I went again, I would get one entree, a side of veg. and some cheesecake (definitely) but I would order it to go.  That would still be a huge meal for two people but I could enjoy it in the quiet of my home.  Overall, the food was okay, not GREAT but not bad.   Everything seems fresh, and with such a huge menu, that in itself is amazing and must be possible due to the high volume of diners. The prices are high and appear to be somewhat a-la-cart.  If you want a salad or vegetable, you need to order it.   The atmosphere is casual but loud and crowded.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-king-of-prussia?start=220,3.56,3.61,3.61,3.1480000000000006,3.5900000000000003

99,Michael P.,"King of Prussia, PA",300,104,3838.0,3.0,2016-03-06,"Fine. Loud. Hit or miss food.  My friend and I arrived at 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday. Normally I don't come to Cheesecake Factory because of their insane waits. In fact, even though I could see it out my bedroom window for 10 years, I had only been to this location once. While we had a backup restaurant if the wait was terrible, we were told 10 minutes and actually seated in 5 minutes. We got a small table near the back. And when I say small table, I mean small table.  It barely fit our drinks and appetizer. We  struggled throughout the meal not to knock things off of it. Unfortunately, it was virtually on top of the table next to ours as well. At least it enabled us to become friendly with the foursome to our side. We waited about 10 minutes for a waiter to finally come over. Once he did, we requested water, which we had not yet received. My friend ordered a half bottle of Veuve Clicquot champagne, because she was in a bad mood and decided to splurge, even though the half bottle cost more than a full bottle at a store. The waiter then told us that they don't have half bottles, but my friend pointed it out on the menu. Despite their very poor beer list, they did have Stone IPA in bottles.  So I ordered one of those. The waiter returned about five minutes later with the half bottle of champagne and a bucket to keep it chilled as well as my beer.   My friend and I decided to split an order of nachos for an appetizer, and I ordered a hamburger medium rare you know why she ordered a chicken dish for our entrees. I have to admit the nachos were surprisingly good. They seemed very fresh with lots of cheese, guacamole, and sour cream. I ended up eating more of them that I had expected. However, they were the best part of the meal. Unfortunately, our entrees were not nearly as good as the nachos. My burger, which again, I had ordered medium rare, was well done. It was dry and relatively tasteless. It was also not brought with the condiments I had requested on the side. It also came with a very small side of fries. I was just not in the mood to send it back and wait for another one though. My friend's chicken, which I did not taste since I don't eat chicken, was cold and tasteless. She said it was cooked, but cold. At least I could order another Stone IPA and she could enjoy her champagne.    For dessert, we split the ""ADAM'S PEANUT BUTTER CUP FUDGE RIPPLE CHEESECAKE (Creamy Cheesecake Swirled with Caramel, Peanut Butter, Butterfingers® and Reese's® Peanut Butter Cups.)"" It was good, but not great. It kind of tasted like it had come out of a box.   Overall the service was pretty good. After the initial delayed water and misunderstanding about the champagne, our server was attentive except for the condiments, and it is not his fault that the entrees were not good. The restaurant itself was quite loud, measuring 93 decibels.  I won't say that I will never come back, but with so many good options in the area I'm unlikely to be back anytime soon.

102,Kyleigh C.,"Metairie, LA",264,3,,1.0,2016-09-05,"My friends and I were visiting the area and decided to come to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner at 9pm. We sat outside on Monday 9/5/16. When we were being seated we heard a girl (obviously working patio) says ""ugh great. I'm gonna kill myself"" making us feel as though she did not want us to sit out there. When she approached me and my other friend while the other two people with us were using the restroom, she slammed the bread basket down and said ""what can I get you to drink"". I responded and said ""I would like a diet"". She returned to get the drinks and while she was coming in the door as my friends were coming out she was mocking me saying ""I'll have a diet"" in a rude condescending tone to her accompanying server on the patio. Our servers name was Emily. However I do not know the name of the other server on the patio who, while our server was taking our order walked by and said, "" I hate me life"" and our server discretely responded ""same"". I did not witness this myself, one of the people I was with did. Me and my friends have NEVER been treated so terribly. We are all servers ourselves and know it can be frustrating at times but this was absurd. When we asked the hostess for a manager, no manager came. We believe the also rude hostess never said anything to the manager on duty. We feel extremely disrespected and will not be back. Food was okay, not bad but not great either. There were things missing from our order, chicken as a topping on a salad and no jalapeños on the nachos. Small things that usually we would pay no mind to but we believe was done intentionally. We felt rushed by not only our server but by the other server with the braids on the patio as well. If I had a dollar for every time the two servers on the patio had rolled their eyes or loudly stated walking past not only our table but others ""I am going to kill myself"" we wouldn't have had to pay for our $128.00 meal. We spent a lot of money and tipped 20% because that is in our nature. The server did not deserve it, but we will not stoop to the level of the employees you currently have working there.   If you would like to see what good service looks like, when you are serving 12 tables at once instead of 3, come visit the brickyard in Williamsport.

So then we order our food and I specifically ask to not have shrimp on it.  He said no problem and it will be $17.25.  Out comes the food.  Shawn ordered me the wrong meal.  Awesome!! So my mom starts eating.  After 15 minutes, no sign of our waiter of course, I see another waiter and ask for the manager.  My mom is done eating and I have no food yet.  No manager ever came to the table.  20 minutes later I got my food.  No manager.  I ate it.  Got the bill.  Was charged for shrimp!!! Was so pissed at the whole experience.  Just paid and left.  I live in Florida and I have never had this happen the many times I eaten in that restaurant there before.   I asked for a manager.  None ever came because I got the wrong food, my bill was wrong, we complained when we sat down, the waiter was never seen, the hostess was awful!!! I wrote this same review on Wednesday January 3, 2017 on the Cheesecake website and no one has contacted me.  Goes to show how much they care about customer service!!!  I just received a call from Chris from Customer Service. He was following up on the experience.  1/8/2017.  I appreciated the call.  Thank you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-king-of-prussia?start=120,3.28,3.52,3.58,3.056,3.4240000000000004

The entree I had was quite enjoyable, so what happened? Normally I always order the luscious stuffed chicken tortillas but today I went with the herb crusted salmon. It was perfectly cooked and seated in a well put together lemony butter sauce. This meal came with mashed potatoes and about some asparagus that was also cooked perfectly. I was disappointed in the size of the cheesecake. My piece was very narrow and small. There's nothing more upsetting than when restaurants start short portioning and raising prices. I ordered a piece of cheesecake to go. The white chocolate raspberry cheesecake for my daughter which was around 8$ and change. It was extremely small and broken in half though I handled it with utmost care. Very disappointed because this is a very expensive dessert. A lousy impression of the restaurant to take with me.

This location in King of Prussia is conveniently attached to the mall, so it is easy to take a break from shopping and grab a bite to eat. Their lunch menu is served until 5:00pm which is nice because you can grab an early dinner and get the lunch specials, which are a lot cheaper than the dinner menu.  I came here with my sister on her last visit in the area. We had been shopping and decided to grab an early dinner at about 4:00pm. The restaurant was quiet at this time and we were seated right away. We both got the lunch salmon specials. She got the fresh grilled salmon and I got the herb crusted filet of salmon.

First, let's talk about the good.  The food here is always good and very consistent.  There is a ton of options here, and if you can't find something on this menu, there is probably something seriously wrong with you.  Some of my personal favorites include the quesadilla, black pepper shrimp, factory meatloaf, and Louisiana chicken pasta.  The portions are huge, so expect to come home with leftovers.  I've never ordered anything that I really didn't like.  The cheesecake is fantastic, and there are about 30-40 different options.  My favorite is the Adams peanut butter. Now the bad.  This place is notorious for long waits.  Being in the King of Prussia mall which is always busy means always at least a 20-30 min wait and sometimes upwards of 2 1/2-3 hours during the holiday season.  My big problem is that you will be told the wait is 20-30 minutes and end up waiting 40-50 minutes for your table.  I've even had a half hour wait turn into an hour and a half on one occasion.  The service is also pretty slow as well.  They really need to get their act together with regards to these issues. So overall, good food, but lackluster service and be prepared to wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-king-of-prussia?start=20,3.56,3.55,3.552,2.444,3.5540000000000003
61,Courtney C.,"Warrington, PA",39,219,287.0,2.0,2017-07-03,"I went to this Cheesecake Factory because I thought it would be a nice change of pace from the Willow Grove location I normally go to. And boy ... was I wrong. It started with the staff who immediately was not friendly. I know they were busy, I understand that but simple niceties would have been appreciated. Then the experience went down hill from there. My friend and I both ordered and my friend was delivered the wrong dish. Okay the waiter comped it but he made it seem as if it was my friend's fault when really the waiter just misheard him apparently. I am sure there are plenty of people who do order something and when they get it say it's not what they ordered (shame on these people) but the waiter clearly misheard him and so when my friend asked what it was, he told him what it was and said that is what he ordered. It was a battle about taking it back, my friend hates wasting and was going to eat it anyway but the waiter offered to swap it (+1) but his tone just seemed very peeved. ""I can swap it but we cook it fresh so it's gonna take awhile"". Okay ... Then my food that I ordered was super liquid-y. I had a dish with a cream sauce and instead of cream it was soup. The sauce didn't even stick to my pasta. It just tastes watery and bland. We had to ask for more bread and drinks , normally we get asked if we want more. And then to top it all off the place, as another yelper had mentioned. It needed a face lift. I realized once my plate was clear that below it was a giant crater from which the entire top surface of the table was removed (the faux marble effect ) to reveal its undersurface - rough and raw. We skipped out on Cheesecake after everything that has gone wrong thus far. And then we left to use the bathroom and there were not even enough bathrooms I waited and waited and had to leave. With a restaurant that huge why do you only have 3 bathrooms? I know that is not the restaurants fault, but it was just another sour note on my first and only poor Cheesecake Factory experience - and I have had a drink spilled on me.

37,Elle P.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,4,3.0,1.0,2017-07-10,"This is probably my least favorite restaurant in the KOP area. Don't get me wrong. I always like to give restaurants the benefit of the doubt if a experience there has been poor. But this restaurant is pretty good with being consistent with poor service and mediocre food.  After my experience here, this will be my last. The server was never attentive. Amongst the many things I told my server, I asked for her to give me utensils so that I can actually eat my meal... which took 15 minutes for me to get her attention. It was a normal paced Sunday night so I was pretty irritated because I was just starving.  One thing that ticked me off - which contributes to the low rating was when my entree did come out - was when the food runner looked at my eyes and said that my steak was rare. I ordered it medium rare, but I specially asked my server to make sure it was on the rare side than medium well. When I finally got my utensils to eat, I cut into the steak to find that it was far from rare. Cooked all the way. It was pretty tough to cut into... I didn't even bother taking a bite. Not sure if it's my fault to order a steak at Cheesecake Factory... I didn't expect it to be like butcher and singers.

35,Lauren M.,"Brookhaven, PA",19,128,187.0,5.0,2017-07-13,"We have been coming here for years and honestly, there's only been one time where we ordered guac and it was unpleasantly salty. Other than that, I've never had a bad meal! The portions are huge. The flavor is always on point. Everything is delicious, always! Don't even get me started on the Cheesecake!!!! Mmmmmm! We usually take it to go. Their green tea is very good! They have my favorite Riesling! Some recommendations: nachos, sweet corn tamale cakes, avocado eggrolls, Louisiana chicken pasta, skinnylicious chicken tacos, burrito, salmon. All delish!  The service is hit or miss. There is a range from excellent and attentive servers to awkward and just ok servers. This is going to happen anywhere. There is always a presence of management. Always.  The downside: It is always ridiculously crowded and they do not accept reservations which is annoying. We have waited up to 2.5 hours to dine here. We expect this on a Saturday so we go knowing it will be that long and we plan to walk around the mall. This is where my biggest frustration is. They used to have a system where they would text when your table was ready which was great because we could walk all the way to the opposite side of the mall and spend our time wisely... shopping! Working up an appetite! They went back to the nasty, germ infested buzzers that don't allow you to go past DSW. I don't appreciate being held captive or else risk losing my table. I also find it disrespectful that there is not adequate seating for a 2.5 hour wait so people are sitting and laying on the floor like dogs. So you have to wait in a confined area for 2+ hours but there's nowhere for that volume of people to wait. It makes no sense. For me, this system needs to be improved.  The one other con is they need to pump up the air, even in the winter. It gets SO crowded in there that when you walk in it is super hot and there's a cacophony of smells. It feels like I'm in a Petri dish. It makes me nauseous.  Overall, we love it here!

They kept me waiting another ten minutes and when they finally brought the item to my car, the woman who brought it acted like I was a complete annoyance to her. It was unbelievable!

93,Sylwia P.,"Merion Station, PA",0,16,2.0,1.0,2017-08-02,"So incredibly upset with the service I received this evening. I took my cousin from out of town to eat at this location since we had a less than pleasant experience in Philly last time. The only reason I keep coming back is the food. For starters our waiter didn't greet us for a while and when he did he only asked for drinks, I had to stop him from leaving so we could order apps. He drops our drinks then runs off. He comes back takes our order, and then the waiting starts. We never received bread, the table next to us got it.  We figured our apps wouldn't take longer than 15 minutes since we ordered them early... wrong. It took 29 minutes. How do I know you may ask? I was sending a text as the waiter approached to take our entree order and once I realized the apps were taking forever I just checked the time stamp 8:38. Our apps arrive at 9:07. Yes I'm timing at this point because I'm getting angry. We dig in but not once did our waiter check on us not like he had the chance to because 6 minutes after our apps hit the table so did our entree. We're half way through apps and we start our dinner. We didn't get to finish either because we were too full, everything was so horribly spaced out. As we finish with our dirty plates stacked in front of us we realize not once did our waiter check to see if the food was okay how we were doing if we needed refills NOTHING. I was at a loss for words at the end of dinner. I have worked as a server for 8 years while being a student and I would be appalled at myself if I ever served someone so horribly. Clearly this guy was not meant to be a server. I let the manager know and his excuse was no not him, he's better than that. Something tells me he's not. I get people have bad days but when you see people next to you being taken care of well by the same person it makes you question.

16,Larry C.,"Valley Stream, NY",179,176,9.0,2.0,2017-08-07,"I feel that I'm being rather generous giving a 2-star rating since most of my dinner experience wasn't 100% awful. Just to quickly go through the good parts of my dinner here: the waiter was nice and checked on us frequently enough, the salmon salad was decent, and the hot spinach dip was exactly what you might expect of a spinach cheese dip.  All rather good things. The highlight however is how bad the Cajun Jambalaya pasta came out.  If you're unfamiliar with the dish, it is a linguine served with chicken and shrimp in cajun seasoning.  The chicken and shrimp were solid; no complaints at all.   Now now, I've had cajun seasoning on food before but under no circumstances have I ever had anything taste as salty as the pasta did.  Have you ever gargled salt water to help treat a sore throat? Now imagine pasta tasting even saltier than that salt water rinsing around your mouth.  I couldn't believe how that could even happen and I really couldn't convince myself not to waste the food.  I'm the type of person that will eat everything I order pretty much as long as it doesn't touch the floor.  This linguine was the first thing I've ever been incapable of stomaching beyond the first bite.

Usually, I don't have any complaints. The food is just average and I always order off the skinnylicious menu because seriously all of their food is WAY too many calories (good luck finding items on the normal menu under 1000 cals) and if you want cheesecake with that, it's just too much for me.   But this last time our waitress was terrible.  She didn't come to check on us at ALL and she got my order wrong.  I ordered the skinnylicious chicken tacos and I got some kind of fish tacos with rice and beans.  The problem is, after we got our food, we couldn't find her or anyone that wasn't running around for that matter, so I ended up just eating it because I was starving.  She also didn't give us any refills on our drinks which was annoying, especially because I literally got water so I don't think I was costing them much.  I hope they're more attentive next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-king-of-prussia,3.08,3.35,3.492,2.7,3.242
89,Lauren P.,"Philadelphia, PA",48,3,,1.0,2017-08-23,"I visited the cheesecake factory King of Prussia Location at 7:00pm on Tuesday, August 22, 2017. Following Patio seating, our server, Gregory, promptly greeted us, took our drink order, and returned shortly thereafter for our meal order. The meal order was taken no later than 7:15/7:20pm.  I ordered the skinnylicious Chicken Salad Sandwich and my husband the Cashew Chicken. We did not receive our dinner until 8:10pm. This was a 50 minute wait for a sandwich and a chicken/rice dish! Before I even had the opportunity to mention the long wait to our server, he took the liberty of apologizing for the delay and twice checked with the kitchen on our meals. We watched two other tables that sat after us receive their food before us (one was a party of five).  Gregory, our server, said he would speak to management to see if we could be compensated for our trouble and came back with the offer of free cheesecake, which was very kind; however, I don't like cheesecake. I would have rather seen one of our four $10 glasses of wine comped. My husband and I each had two glasses of wine before our food even arrived. I located a manager at the check in desk following the dinner to share our experience. I explained I had worked in the food service industry and understand delays, but that our food took almost an hour to arrive. His response was ""Almost an hour. I didn't realize the kitchen was that behind"". After that, he simply said he was sorry - there was no further conversation and he did not seem to be overly concerned. I didn't say it out loud, but thought to myself that as a manager, he should realize how far behind the kitchen is. When i walked in his was at the reception desk and when i walked out he was at the reception desk. Maybe he should move beyond the desk? Also, if our server informed him of our wait, he also should have stopped by our table. Having worked in the food service industry, I understand the etiquette when there is an issue.  I regret to say that I did not ask for his name, but he was an older tall slim gentleman with white hair. We are customers that often frequent the KOP Cheesecake Factory and never leave with a bill under $70 or $80 dollars. I want to ensure you understand that we were not looking for a free meal.

Now the cons: weekends can see waits of anywhere between 45minutes to over an hour at times. Call first!! Depending on where you sit, it can be very loud! Get a booth if possible. The tables feel like you are sitting on the next person's lap. Also, it is easier to hear your guests in a booth. The bar area? Forget it if you want to talk and hear someone. The lighting at night is abysmal. Bring a flashlight to see the menu and your food. Maybe it was the day we went but it was practically black inside. You should still try it at least once. Go hungry, eat up, and take a slice of cheesecake to go!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-king-of-prussia?start=20,2.64,3.3,3.472,2.8320000000000003,3.0360000000000005

18,Jeszel B.,"Springfield, PA",0,9,2.0,4.0,2017-10-01,"I've been here countless of times before. And each time i visit, it's always AMAZING. But let's just discuss why I only gave it 4stars. The spring roll that we had was aL LITTLE undercooked. Coming from an Asian family, I like my spring rolls fully cooked and crispy. The second reason was that when we received our order, the meals were warm/room temperature. I feel like they didn't put it under a food warmer while it was waiting to be picked up by a server. So that was basically it, plus, we went there on a Saturday night, so it was PACKED!! Expect to have a line waiting and be on the waiting list for at least 45 minutes. APPETIZERS:  -Cheese Burger spring rolls: i have never in my life thought about putting a cheeseburger mix/flavor in a spring roll before, and that was INCREDIBLY genius and so delicious -Buffalo Blast- a MUST have when you come to Cheesecake Factory. The flavor is just amazinnng, definitely not a fan of bleu cheese though, just absolutely not my kind of cheese.  Main Course: Boyfriend had the Louisiana chicken pasta, who said ""the chicken melts in my mouth"" and claimed that it was one of the best meals he ever had. I tried it myself and it was pretty awesome! The chicken was so crispy and definitely just melts in your mouth. It wasn't too thick or too thin either. The pasta itself was cooked wonderfully. The flavors exploded in your mouth! So many spices in this dish! I had the Chicken Bellagio, which was superb! I'm a pretty petite woman, so my food portion sizes are small. The meal was HUGE. Literally bigger than my torso. And it was the best pasta and chicken I've ever had. The chicken was amazing, it melted in my mouth also. Was kind of disappointed that the server didn't come back and offer to put cheese on our course, because from the last time we were there, they always came back to offer cheese. But anyways, pasta was perfectly cooked. Again, the food was warm-ish, closer to being room temperature, so that was a downside. The prosciutto was amazing, as always. Would definitely recommend this dish to anyone!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-king-of-prussia,2.72,3.31,3.472,2.6079999999999997,3.074
10,Caroline P.,"Philadelphia, PA",203,20,28.0,4.0,2017-10-04,"Had a great meal here tonight with my best friend. Our meal: Complimentary WARM bread: amazing, I love the dark brown bread which tastes like pumpernickel, it's served with a sweet butter. Arnold palmers: my go to drink which I order almost every time I'm out and let me tell you theirs is down to a science. The rim is lined with sugar and has the perfect consistency of half unsweetened tea and lemonade. Seriously my all time favorite. Passion fruit mojitos: order these. Served in a tall glass, on your first sip it really tastes like passion fruit nectar, rum, lime, and mint-- which is my kind of mojito. I loved the tall sprig of mint in it. Red sangria: this tasted like a true sangria. Nice red wine with hints of brandy. Apples and oranges which tasted like they had been soaking all day. Spinach and artichoke dip: served nice and warm and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. I just wish they served the dip with pita bread instead of chips  Roadside sliders- another all time favorite. I usually order these as a meal with a side of sweet potato fries but on this occasion, we ordered to split. The sliders taste like old school drive-in burgers [similar to Charlie's in Delco :) ]  4 mini burgers in total which are served with ketchup, diced onion, lettuce, and pickle. They are simply delicious and I suggest ordering them with cheese :) Bistro Shrimp Pasta- Delicious as well. Fried shrimp tossed with spaghetti and arugula in what tasted like a creamy garlic-pesto sauce. I only wished that the there was a bit more sauce to the pasta. We also ordered 3 cheesecakes: The original with 3 large glazed strawberries- a classic White chocolate raspberry- my ultimate favorite Toasted marshmallow s'mores: my friend ordered and it was to die for. All in all, a great meal. For what we paid, our waitress seemed a bit to eager for us to be done our meal and I wish it didn't take as long for our drinks and appetizers to be served, because shortly  after, our meals arrived. The drinks and meals are a bit pricey but the justification in my opinion is they are larger than most and I love taking home left overs :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-king-of-prussia,2.8,3.3,3.476,,3.1

8,Bill B.,"Broomall, PA",10,314,186.0,3.0,2017-10-11,I have never been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory.  I will say that the cheesecake is excellent. As it should be from the name. The portions are nice and there are many flavors and varieties. A tad expensive but totally worth it.  The restaurant is usually pretty clean as well so that is a plus for places that are so crowded.  The wait is routinely 1 hour plus.  In my opinion not worth it.  The food is marginal at best. How can it be better when the menu is so huge. That usually means that nothing can be made From scratch.  I find the prices high and the food salty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-king-of-prussia,2.76,3.24,3.456,,3.0480000000000005

4,Brian P.,"Philadelphia, PA",31,124,332.0,2.0,2017-10-28,"The manager was great for seating 20 of us during the Saturday night rush. Our server was as good as he could have been given the circumstances of a packed restaurant. Friendly, prompt, and a great memory. I'll still never understand restaurants that don't take reservations. But that's not part of my review. Just a rant. The issue with this restaurant is the back of the house, not the front. The Beet and Goat Cheese salad was tasty. I liked it a lot. Thought the dressing a tad too sweet, however. I ordered the Crispy Chicken Costoletta and subbed broccoli for the mash and asparagus. Let's start with the fact that I was deep inside the large booth. So I took the plate from the server so he didn't need to reach. The bottom of the plate was filthy (I don't want to think what was under my food). The food cold and tasteless. And the entrées for our two booths came out at completely separate times over 15 minutes. We had three tables and three checks, two different servers. I would have expected each individual table to be served at the same time. Not over 15 minutes start to finish. I get it. Large short order restaurant at a mall. Menu way too large for any potential efficiency. Get as many people in and out of the restaurant as quickly as possible to boost head count and revenue. Here's a thought... Serve 75% of the head count properly with a slimmer menu and great quality to protect your brand and increase your per capita. Or have the back of the house serve everyone that comes coldly with poor quality and boost your short term revenue killing your brand. I know what Cheesecake Factory chose. My first experience with Cheesecake Factory was over 20 years ago in the Inner Harbor of Baltimore and great experiences. Since they've opened a few in the Philly area, I was a promoter. My last few visits to King of Prussia and Willow Grove leave me avoiding altogether. The only reason I was here was because someone hosted a birthday dinner.

Overall we probably waited 45 minutes to get sat and we got there at 5:30. We originally planned to sit at the bar first anyway for a drink or two, so the wait was ok for us.  The only real annoying part of the night was the bar itself. There was a single mother with 4 kids sitting at the bar eating dinner. I actually looked into this, as I thought it was illegal for kids to sit at the bar. It's not illegal as long as they are with a adult, which they were so I really had nothing to bitch about as far as the company side of things. But just thought it was rude to the adults and the bartenders working that 4 of their 12 seats were being used up by non tipping customers.  lol I'm reaching here I'm sure but, otherwise the place gets 5.
