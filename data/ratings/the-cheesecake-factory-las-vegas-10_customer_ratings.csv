228,Carlos A.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,21,32.0,4.0,2015-05-18,"I was fortunate enough to go to their mock service and enjoy a meal with a guest. The food was delicious. I had the steak medallions and also the BBQ chicken salad. The medallions where booked to a perfect medium rare and seasoned perfectly, the salad was huge and more than enough for two. Since it was a practice run our server was immensely nervous. We waited a while, but thankfully I had time to spare. The food did take a little while to get to us , but that can be expected in a practice service. All in all our server was attentive and pleasant. For a hundred dollar tab on them all I can say is thank you Cheesecake  Factory!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-10?start=160,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003
116,Misty M.,"Salt Lake City, UT",241,81,67.0,5.0,2015-05-18,"Cheesecake Factory at the outlets downtown! What's not to like? I'll list what there IS to like first. 1) Giant covered patio with fans so you enjoy the outdoor feel, but are insulated from outlet traffic and direct sunlight. 2) Very willing and able to split checks. I went with 7 friends and our waiter offered to split the check for us; we didn't even have to ask. 3) Someone constantly checking on you. If my water glass hit 75% full, it was promptly filled back up. We were also asked at least twice if our food was all cooked to our liking. 4) Those bread baskets. If you haven't been to Cheesecake Factory and are opposed to chain restaurants, at least go enjoy a complimentary bread basket and a latte.  5) The food is delicious and amazing and they hit every price range. You can spend $50 on yourself for dinner, or $10 and still leave satisfied and happy.  6) Contrary to what most people would think, this is a great restaurant to go to if you're gluten-free or gluten intolerant. They mark menu items with a GF option so you can have a ton of items modified to be gluten-free (pasta, flat breads, sandwiches, salads, etc.). The only negative I can think of is the fact that this restaurant is crowded. I wouldn't recommend it for an intimate occasion. The customer to server ratio has got to be 5:1. I've never seen so many servers in one place. It's good because you get a ton of attention, but can be annoying when you're trying to walk to your table and walk to the bathroom and have to wait for a lot of people to pass.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-10?start=140,2.868,2.868,2.868,2.868,2.868
128,Romina C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,10,4.0,1.0,2015-05-20,Poor Customer Service. Waiters are rude and told me not to bring my baby's stroller inside and they let us sit outside just because we have a baby. Then I saw that other parents have their strollers with them. So I also did the same because I dont see anything wrong taking the stroller with me. We like the Rampart branch better. The waiter is just not friendly and they serve us cold bread.

232,Tia Y.,"Cerritos, CA",0,4,2.0,4.0,2015-05-24,"Although our sever did inform us that this was one of the newer locations, I believe that the host stand could use a little work on customer service. My family and I were not asked and didn't feel as though we had an option on whether or not we wanted to sit on the patio, but we tried to make it work. We ended up asking for a different table on the patio and I completely understand having to deal with picky guests as I too work in the restaurant business, but if we had been offered the patio from the beginning we would have politely declined. Our server Skyler was AWESOME though. He had all the answers to the questions we had about the menu. He never looked bored or like he wanted us to hurry up. He was very attentive and we never had to ask for refills. In the end, I would say we were very well taken care of by Skyler.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-10?start=160,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004
118,Amanda D.,"Santa Monica, CA",88,71,68.0,2.0,2015-05-29,"This whole experience was a struggle. When the hostess was walking us to our table I overheard a waitress look at our party of 11 and say ""oh great"". Very warm welcoming... Being the chatty gal that I am, our server informed me that it had only been open for a week so I decided to give them a hall pass. We had 2 servers for a party of 11... is that really necessary?  Getting our drinks took forever, getting our food took forever, getting our separate checks took an eternity. What was supposed to be a quick work lunch break turned into a 2 hour meal. 3 of us ordered the same appetizer, mine came out first, then 10 mines later the second one came out with a noticeable smaller portion. I immediately notified I server (My side of the table had the competent server) and he directed the manager to come see us. The manager said he would give us another order gratis. When all the entrees came out, the 3rd appetizer came out. By the end they tried charging us for 4 appetizers. It was really just one thing after the other. And I get it, it was their first week open but it seemed like their staff had no industry experience. By the time we were heading out it was packed. I know this place is destined to do well because the Premium Outlets lack decent dining. Hopefully the staff gets better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-10?start=140,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006

111,Nadia H.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,39,,2.0,2015-06-11,"I have to agree with everyone else who has had issues with this particular Cheesecake Factory. I'm a huge fan of the chain and was excited when a location opened close to my work downtown. At this point, though, I can say my co-workers and I will probably never return to this one again. We were a party of 8 and arrived early, so we beat the entire lunch crowd in terms of getting seated and getting our orders in. When we ordered, I asked the waitress for bread and butter. 10 minutes later, we were all sitting around, still waiting for our bread and butter. 45 minutes after we had ordered, our food was still nowhere to be seen. When the food did begin to come out, it came in waves. Eventually, all but one of us had gotten our food. This was bizzarre because three people at the table had ordered salmon. Two got their salmon, the third was left waiting. It was a solid 7 minutes that we all sat around staring at our food as it grew cold while we waited for the final person to get her meal so we could all start eating.  The manager did come and appologize for this, and gave her a comped dessert, so that was nice. Another person's salmon ended up being completely burned on the bottom, so that had to go back and the manager her a comped dessert as well.  We were there for a celebreation, so when it came time to order dessert, several of us ordered cheesecake. I ordered a slice of the Banana Creme Cheesecake. They brought our cheesecakes, and I took one bite of mine and it was FROZEN. At that point, I was so over it I didn't even want to mention it to the waitress, but the rest of my party was fed up and told her as soon as she came over again. She made a face and informed us that the Cheesecakes are all freshly made. I poked the cheesecake with my fork to demonstrate and it made the classic ""crunch"" sound of a frozen cake, so she took away my cheesecake and was gone for another 10 minutes (this was the trend of the whole meal). When she returned, she asked if I'd like to have strawberry cheesecake instead. I said no thank you, can I please just have another slice of the banana creme? She then informed me that the banana creme was all frozen. So I ended up with no cheesecake. And all would have been well if that had been the end of it. I'd have left sad and disappointed, but not angry. No, the anger came when I got the bill and saw that my frozen, inedible, cheesecake that I had been forced to cancel was charged on the bill, and then marked as a ""comp."" Being forced to take back food because it is frozen is not a ""comp, "" that is bad customer service. It is insulting to your customers when you mark food as a ""comp"" when in fact they received nothing. I had one bite of frozen cake and was forced to send it back. You have not done me any favors by not charging me for that cake. That cake should never have been given to me in the first place.  Overall, the main dishes we did receive were the usual yummy quality of Cheesecake Factory. But getting our bread took forever, getting our food took forever, getting our desserts took forever, and getting our bill took forever. There is a serious managment issue going on with this location that needs to be fixed ASAP.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-10?start=140,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.888000000000001

My girlfriend then right away went to the restroom, came back, then I went to the restroom... And we waited, and waited. Mind you no one had acknowledged that we were there. Bussers, waiters, would walk by, and nope not even a ""Hi, have you been helped, yet?"" Nothing. So after maybe 20 minutes of waiting we finally grab a waiter walking by and ask to speak to a manager there. Again, another 10 minutes. When she did show up, I was suprised. Very unproffesional. Very, very unprofessional. Like she didnt care. So it turns out the reason we were just there, sitting was because the ""section"" was closed... Horrible experience. Dont go there.

Well from the moment we sat down to the moment we left (almost running out the door) we had the most disappointing experience. John M. was our server and came to take our drink order first,  everyone else ordered soft drinks and i ordered a apple cider,  5 minutes later drinks arrived except mine, was told it was coming next,  10 more mins passed was asked if anyone had brought my cider yet and was again told ""right away"" another 5 mins passed before i received my drink only to receive a glass half the size as everyone else's and with no ice at all, (room temperature apple juice). Finally we all put in our orders, 3 of us ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with a mix of chicken and shrimp , after waiting 45 mins we were served. The pasta was already starting to harden, the chicken had no flavor, the shrimp was chewy and the Alfredo sauce was watery, as if the pasta was not strained all the way. At the end 5 of us were very disappointed with our meal and our server noticing our not too pleased faces decided to ask the manager if he could comp 2 desserts. Dessert was the only thumbs up we gave for the night, but even dessert couldn't stop us from wanting to run out of there!

If you read the rest of the reviews here, lots of people have issues regarding service. I get that this is a new location and it takes time to work out the kinks, but people just gotta take a chill pill!!! Our first visit, we split the Chicken Chilaquiles and the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, both were excellent,and the food came out in a timely matter. Our server couldn't answer a few questions about a few of the menu items we had, but no big deal..everything else was good. This recent visit over EDC weekend, once again, we went for the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and this time we ordered the Chorizo Chicken Hash with Poached Eggs. We noticed however that our waitress seemed preoccupied and didn't seem happy. We had a few questions about things and  got short answers. We knew something was up. Now at this point, people  would dock a star or two regarding service,  but upon returning, Wifey asked politely ""Having a rough day?"" Our waitress stepped back with a big sigh and apologized explaining the start of her day with a huge  power outage, EDC traffic, getting the kids ready, and getting ready for work all at the same time, so finding this out, we kinda sympathized with her and assured her that the worst part of her day was over, and whaddayouknow? Her demeanor did a 180...some people just need some positive reinforcement ya know?  Drinks were refilled, checked up on us periodically, and even the manager came by and was apologetic when she saw our food hadn't arrived yet!? We didn't feel  like it was a long wait, probably because I was engaged in conversation with my hot date across me...; ) When our food did arrive, the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes were bomb as always, and The Chorizo Chicken Hash was perfection. From the perfectly oozing poached egg (lots of places have a hard time doing this) to the extra crispy hash I requested, no complaints here!

125,Michelle B.,"Long Beach, CA",4,25,25.0,5.0,2015-07-27,This is considered the North Las Vegas location. Best service from Gary P. We went to this location instead of on the Strip to avoid the wait times. Our party of 7 was seated immediately on a Thursday night without any wait. Its located on the north end of a new Outlet mall off Bonneville. There is a parking structure right across from the restaurant. Our server Gary P. was the best! He assisted everyone (including the kids) with a friendly and easygoing manner to order exactly what they wanted. I ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta (veg) with chicken even though that wasn't an option on the menu. Gary came over many times to make sure our drinks were filled and brought us extra bread. Everything was cooked perfectly and the wait time for the food was not long. I also ordered the Godiva Chocolate cheesecake to go and everyone enjoyed a bite at the hotel. Best service I've ever had at any Cheesecake factory!

I literally work about 300 ft. away, so I knew that I was going to have to practice self-control. I've placed my lunch order for pick-up here a few times now and it's been nothing but awesome. Every time I call, the ladies on the other line are friendly. At the pick-up counter with all the chaos of other orders, the cashiers are fast and friendly. I haven't had any of my orders screwed up, so kudos to them, especially with my lunch being timed. As for the food, everyone knows their menu is vast. If you're eating healthy or don't give a crap about heart disease, they have something for everyone. They can even alter some items to be gluten free. Portions are huge, so you can always split your meal into 2 servings. And of course, who can forget their infamous delicious cheesecakes? Oreo, lemon merengue, vanilla bean, plain, etc. The list goes on for about a page and a half on the menu. Hence, where the self-control comes into play.

209,Cassandra B.,"North Las Vegas, NV",660,481,1339.0,3.0,2015-07-30,"I've never been a fan of Cheesecake Factory because I feel like their food is mediocre and overpriced. That being said, this newly opened restaurant at the Las Vegas North Premium Outlets is a welcome addition. Dining options at the outlets have always been severely limited and kind of atrocious. It's nice to have a sit-down option instead of eating at the food court.  PRO TIP: Make sure to enter through the front entrance near the street, otherwise you'll walk in on the side like we did and be confused as to where the hostess stand is located.  COMPLIMENTARY BREAD: Served with softened butter that spread easily on the bread. Love when that happens. 4/5 FRIED ZUCCHINI ($4.95): Served with a side of ranch. Came with maybe 8 pieces of zucchini. Delicious. 4/5 LOUISIANA CHICKEN PASTA ($16.95): Our waiter said this dish was very popular. My husband and I split this dish and ordered the chicken on the side. More than enough food for two people! I don't understand how they serve this huge bowl of pasta to one individual. Unfortunately, the dish wasn't as spicy as I would have liked and could have used a bigger helping of veggies. 2/5  SERVICE: Waiter was great. He was super cool about accommodating a picky vegetarian eater (me). Hostess was super friendly and we were sat at a booth on a Monday night with no wait time. 4/5   VIBE: Modern cafe with a tan and brown color palette. Very family friendly. 3/5  GOOD TO KNOW: If you fill out the feedback survey on your receipt, you get a $10 e-gift card good on your next visit. :) Worth a Return Visit? Subtotal was about $27 for one entree and one small appetizer. Prices add up quickly here. We ate here because we were starving and didn't have a lot of dining options available to us. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, only as a last resort kind of thing.

52,Margret C.,"Las Vegas, NV",208,1405,760.0,5.0,2015-08-10,"I was so excited about the expansion of the Premium Outlets/North, and was even more so, when I heard that this major restaurant was joining the newest shopping wing. Good timing, too. We had a couple gift cards to use.  So, we came here on saturday for lunch, way before the crowd; since we got a tip from one of the ladies here to get in here before 12:15 pm as we were checking out the menu posted outside.  We had the complimentary bread basket  with butter (french baguette slices and pumpernickel slices) and our little man had one too, which also included sliced bananas. I had a bunch of questions about the menu, since it'd been a while. I opted for the lunch size asian salad, while hubby had his favorite item, the cuban sandwich, and our little man had the mini corndogs and fries. It was delicious. I couldn't finish my salad, which was pretty big, even for the lunch size, but I'm glad I asked about the size of the salad. We also got dessert, once I mentioned the crazy one, hubby wanted that one. It was really good, too. I just was stuffed. (We had leftovers.) We still had a balance on one of the gift cards. They are treated as credit cards, so you still have to sign them.  The service was excellent- our server was pretty attentive (drink refills, and checking on us from time to time). And the other servers were nice and smiling, as they passed us, too. It's refreshing to see people in customer service who want to be there, who enjoy their jobs.    Inside, the decor (barqoue/neo-classical- elegant), was very in line with their other restaurants (been to Forum/Summerlin/Green Valley). We had to switch seats (booth & tables seating is available) as the TV had hubby's game that he was DVR'ing. Our stoller was stored with the rest, elsewhere. The lady gave us a claim ticket.  Bathrooms were near the entrance. There were mens, womens, and a family one. I went into the womens and there were two stalls, one was handicapped. I went into the smaller one so I don't know if there was a baby changing station in the handicapped stall.  The food court at this Premium Outlets is really lacking (Ok, who am I kidding, it sucks!), so this restaurant is going to be very busy and popular (the huge menu and the huge selection of cheesecake flavors). Hubby mentioned that this could be one of our special occasion restaurants. Our first date was at the one at Forum Shops (back in 2004). So, yes, we will be back. It's a yummy place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-10?start=100,3.24,3.24,3.24,3.2840000000000003,3.2400000000000007

Then eventually some silverware... And a tea... And then some bread... And then my salad is missing the pecans and is drizzled with 2 unfortunate bites of goat cheese.  I politely ask for the salad to be tossed with some pecans.  But alas it returns with just a few pecans (wouldn't you think to toss in like a solid partial handful or something) and still no goat cheese.  Did the chef just look at it when it returned and say -- ""that looks like shit.. Let's serve it again like that.""  The waitress and manager were the saving grace of this whole operation (and the reason for 3 stars).  They were extremely polite and empathetic, but I will not be coming back to this location just out of the shear complacence in the food preparation.  I hate being that guy, but when your order doesn't get fixed after you send it back, something must be said.   Sincerely, Unsatisfied customer: Jeff",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-10?start=200,3.36,3.36,3.36,3.0520000000000005,3.3600000000000003

I'd never been to this one, but it is closer to home, so decided to take the family here for dinner.  Parking wasn't too bad. We parked in the Parking Garage B right off Bonneville. Took us maybe 5-8 minutes to find parking and we walked across the street from the parking garage to the restaurant. The restaurant has valet too so if you prefer not to deal with the parking, I highly advise. The front entrance to the restaurant is off of the street side across from the garage. You can also enter from another door that is deeper inside the mall, but then you have to walk through the dining room to get to the hostess area at the front.  For appetizers, the family and I ordered the Fried Mac and Cheese balls (delicious) and an assortment of varied spring rolls which were also very good.    I ordered Evelyn's Famous Pasta. As to be expected, the portion size was huge! Everything in the dish tasted fresh and not overly cooked. The broccoli had a bit of crispness left to it and the mushrooms weren't soggy! It was very good.  Hubby had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and even he said he was surprised how great it was!  The wait time wasn't too bad for our food.

155,Christina W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,2015-11-19,"Yesterday was my 25th birthday and the day before was my 3 year wedding anniversary so my husband and I decided to celebrate at my new favorite place, the cheesecake factory. And being Vegas locals why not go to the new one so that we can shop at the outlets right after. Lets start off by saying I'm 9 months pregnant so waiting for food for too long is not my best friend. We came in and it took a second to be greeted by the host because she found whatever she was doing to be more important. After she was done she did greet us and we waited to be seated. Our host came and showed us to our seat and said our waiter would be with us shortly. So to kill time we started talking until we noticed it had been 5 min already and no one has acknowledged us yet , but we saw plenty servers walking by. My patience started wearing thin as an additional 10 minz had went by and weren't offered so much as a hello, a drink, NOTHING. so I finally asked a girl if I can speak with the manager and instead of going to get he or she, she replied ""oh I'm your server give me a minute they seated three of y'all at once"". First that's very unprofessional, second don't think that because we're both African american that I'll just be ok with that and let you talk to me the way you feel comfortable, and third if you were so busy its not that hard to COMMUNICATE that with your guests. So of course I took my business elsewhere so thanks a lot for wasting my time that I can never get back and ruining my birthday and I will be sure to yelp you folks as well.

We sat at the and the bartender quickly gathered our order for some cocktails. The Tropical Martini tastes like you should be on a cruise ship.  The martini glass has a sugar rim and the fruit taste is very refreshing. We shared the Caesar salad and the firecracker salmon. The firecracker salmon is in a crisp wrapper that is very light and the salmon is soft and cooked well.  The Caesar salad is always good at Cheesecake Factory. Perfect blend of Parmesan and dressing.

The Cheesecake Factory has a large selection of items on the menu, as well as a large selection of cheesecakes to choose from for dessert. Anything that you may feel to be in the mood for, they will have it from pastas, to burgers, to steaks. My personal favorite is the Hibachi Steak and I have many favorites for cheesecake, especially the Oreo cheesecake.

I've gone there three times not wanting to not like them. Located in the Outlet Mall near downtown Las Vegas the newest CF in Las Vegas. Everything I tried this last time was too little or too much. The beet and goat cheese salad. Beets were over cooked and smushy. I've never had smushy beets. They were also too salty. Too few pieces of pecans and goat cheese. The dressing had too much vinegar and too little oil. I ordered the steak medallion instead of the steak Diane off the skinnylicious menu. The serving was too small and again too too much salt. I was done after two bites. I tried my daughters buffalo chicken appetizer. Again too salty. She had a side of the buffalo sauce. Guess what too salty. My strawberry lemonade that I always get several refills was too sweet. I don't know what's going on with this location but I am not in too much a rush to go back.

By the time the dishes came the buffalo blast were over fried as if the grease was old.  So the server took it back. Within 2 minutes they brought out the same blast that I just sent back. When they finally brought the blast out they looked the same.  If anyone has ever had an order of buffalo blast they are very light with a hint of chicken and a blast sauce inside.  So of course I didn't want them 20 minutes later.  The bun on the bacon burger was hard as if it was stale. The bacon burger had 2 strips of regular bacon and literally 2 small squares of applewood bacon ;(. When the waiter brought out the check he took off the order for the blast but added an order of buffalo wings that no one ordered.  The only thing that was worth the trip was the bread and butter. Of course the check was adjusted but we were really disappointed with the Cheesecake Factory.   Thank goodness for Winchells being open 24 hours.

141,Brad C.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,18,4.0,1.0,2016-05-31,"Food is fine and tastes the same as all other Cheesecake Factory's.  That is not the issue.  The issue I have is the way this location was designed.  The front door is near valet to the mall where only 100 cars can park. The other 10,000 parking spaces are located elsewhere and lead directly into the mall.  But the back door to the Cheesecake factory is closer to the actual mall and much more convenient for people to enter and leave the restaurant.  Half the seating in this location is located in the row going from the check-in to the back door.  And this is the only seating where they allow children.  So as your eating you literally have 100's of people walking back and forth past your table to enter and leave the restaurant.  No one uses the front door since it leads out to the street and the mall is the other direction.  Now add a stroller with a sleeping baby in it.  We usually ask for a table away from others so our child is not a distraction.  We know what it was like before we had a child.  But this place was packed and we had to take the only available table which was a booth.  So we placed the stroller plush against the front of the booth since our child was asleep.  But now with 100s of people coming in and out the back door we closed traffic to one way since the stroller was there.  Now the manager noticed the interruption of bodies moving because of the stroller and was about to ask us to move it down the hall when he realized our son was asleep in it.  So I asked him to make the back door an exit only like most businesses.  And he tried explaining it is a fire hazard which is not true.  it is only a fire hazard if it is locked and you can not get out.  So this meal was certainly not relaxing and not enjoyable.  Trying to make sure people do not run into the stroller and eat at the same time is not fun.  They are more worried about losing customers because they cant actually find the front door to this location than making the people their comfortable.  And if they had told us from the get go their was no place to sit with a stroller we would have gone somewhere else.

She gave a rude look like she didn't want to do it but did anyway. I bit my tongue and shrugged it off and said thank you when we got our 2 slices for take out. We walk around the outlet mall and notice one of the slices was a lot bigger than the other.  I had always thought cheesecake slices were huge and equal portions, I guess not. My wife and I were contemplating on exchanging it for equal slices since they were the same price at $7.95. We arrive back at the cheesecake factory with only 5 to 10 minutes passing by since us leaving. I did not wan't to deal with the rude employee so I approached a manager and he had asked if everything was fine. I explained I wanted to exchange the slice for a bigger portion since they were the same price. Get our moneys worth you know... Sam the manager said once a slice leaves the place they can't exchange it but he could give a discount at 25% if we would like to purchase a bigger piece. I agreed and had already pulled my debit card and he noticed my military ID thanking me for my service. I said thank you also. At the sometime the disgruntle employee is nodding her head in disgust as if we were trying to get a free slice. I couldn't hold my tongue anymore and said this is what I had to deal with earlier. Pointed to her and told him she is rude. He said don't worry I will take care of you and you can pick a slice and we will cover it. Let me explain I did not want anything free but I called my wife over and she picked out an oreo cheesecake slice. The employee had to cut the free slice for us but was still shaking her head. This made me more furious and I started to raise my voice. During all this commotion the employee was still nodding her head the whole time I was talking to Sam. There was at least 4 separate instances she did it. Sam said he would take care of her later. He also explained he would take care of us the next time we came in. He asked if we were locals. I said yes I have been stationed at Nellis, AFB more than 11 years. I still left pissed off. I don't care about the free slice. I would have paid for better customer service.

When it was delivered the waiter told me that I had ordered a salad. Our family just laughed cause they heard me order the fries. No big deal. I told him that I would need some ketchup to put on my hamburger and at least 15 minutes passed until he came back with the ketchup and at which time he said... I'll get those sweet potato fries ordered for you. I told him to forget it as it was too late. We were already done eating and were ready to leave. I asked him for a to go container for my daughter's barely uneaten entree and again 10 minutes later I had to ask a busboy to bring one over.

We got 2 Bacon- Bacon cheeseburgers which were big with some fries, the teriyaki chicken, a cheese pizza for one of the kids, grilled cheese sticks for another and mini corndogs for the last one. They were all good. The teriyaki chicken was a bit dry and needed a little bit more favor added to it, the pineapple that came with the chicken was super sour so wasnt touched after I tried it, the mini corndog meal for the kids were just three little things on a stick with a tiny bowl of fruit and that was gone in no time and the kid was still hungry. (News flash some kids eat more then others.. the kids menu goes from I wanna say 4 to 10 years old.. but that is too little for a 9 year old.. come on). The service could have been a little better we were sitting there a good 20 minutes before we could even get dessert. The kids hot fudge sundae was just two tiny ( barely there )scoops of icecream with a little bit of chocolate chips, and fudge on it and cost $3.50 ( again some kids can eat more).

So let me start by saying that I honestly wasn't a huge Cheesecake Factory ""goer"" if you will but after today that may change and I wll tell you why! I was invited by an old co-worker to come out for some drinks and some snacks! My first thought was Cheesecake Factory? For Happy Hour? Huh!? Yes! No doubt I pulled up the menu online and say a few things that I'd be interested in. Now like any other happy hour menu the options to choose from are minimal however they do offer some great ones! I have to highlight that not only do they offer Long Island Ice Tea's but in TALL glasses! For only $5 I believe! What a steal! I was determined to try every drink but they would've had to wheel my out of there! I was able to also try the margarita and although it wasn't as strong as the Long Island it was still acceptable! Crab Spinach dip is a MUST! Even though the happy hour is only from 4-6PM I would still encourage everybody to check it out! This was my first time to this location and I was impressed!

When the bakery answers, there was no greeting just a very stern voice stating ""what can I help you with?"" I asked for mozzarella sticks, MY MISTAKE. She says ""we don't serve mozzarella sticks"". I advised her that I saw them on the menu and she then says ""we have fried cheese"". I said ok I'll take those. She said is that all? And I felt rushed by her tone,  I placed two entrées in a hurry. She asked again is that all. I said yes, do I need to pay she said no. As I started to ask for my total she ended the call in my face! So I called back to speak with the manager. I was placed on hold for 5 minutes and someone else answers the phone and asked me what she could assist me with. I asked if she was the manager, I was shocked when she replied ""is that what you're holding for?"" I said yes and she placed me back on hold a couple of minutes. Andrew, the manager answered, and I explained to him why I was upset, he also seemed to be in a rush to get me off the phone so he just gave me my total and said ""anything else I can assist you with?"" Wow.. I was in shock! What started with being a simple complaint about one person, ended with me being disappointed with four people at this location that did not handle me professionally.

They came by once to say it's coming out but it took them 30-45 mins to bring it out by that time I was done with my dry pasta. No longer needed it.

The waiting line was long since it's in an outlet mall so I already saw that coming. The receptionist informed me it would take around 40 minutes to get a table and we agreed.  We sat by the long bench BESIDE the recepionists desk because we didn't want to miss our names. 30 something minutes passed and I asked for an update. They said we were to be called next, just waiting for the table to be emptied, so okay. So far so good. A few minutes after, they called in a party of 5, then a party of 3, and then another party of 6. I was confused because they said we were next. Approached the employee who was informing guests that there were available bar stools for anyone who wants them. Rudely answered and argued with my brother. He was in my brother's face already, so I talked to the receptionists behind the desk. I was so shocked when they said they called us TEN TIMES ALREADY, the other said FOUR TIMES. WOW, talk about inconsistency. Again, we were seated BESIDE THE RECEPTIONISTS DESK. No way we couldn't hear them IF EVER THEY CALLED US. Asked for a manager, but he was impolite and inattentive. Tried explaining our situation and get an apology from him but what he did was straight on unprofessional. He shoved the paper with my name on it to let me know that we were getting a table now. The worst manager ever, or so I thought.... After seating at our table, another manager approached us, hoping for a better response, we tried explaining what happened, never listened, kept cutting our sentences and even had the nerve to tell us not to argue with him. We were explaining, not arguing. Even told us he'd talk to the crew right away, followed him with my eyes, he didn't even say a word to them. So arrogant and ill-mannered. Walked away without even apologizing.  They should thank the waitress they assigned to us. Made our experience a little tolerable.

177,Kara L.,"Las Vegas, NV",97,16,,2.0,2017-06-10,"Generally when you go to chain restaurants, you expect the same delivery in taste and experience on the whole. Unfortunately this location did not. My boyfriend and I went after a lovely show at the Smith Center and it let out about 10pm. We wanted to go eat somewhere nice and conveniently close. As we love our Cheesecake Factory at Green Valley Ranch, we decided to try this location based on our great experiences with the other locations. Great factor was that it was open till 12am but downside is that even though there were not so many people on a Friday night, the service was very slow. We usually get our favorites, Avocado Spring Rolls, Bistro Shrimp Pasta and Rib Eye Steak.  The Spring rolls were delicious as is the sauce which is easily devoured! But the Bistro Shrimp pasta was really spicy! Now this is supposed to be a general garlic and wine sauce with no spicyiness at all. It had way too much red chili peppers! My mouth was on fire!  The steak was burned but my boyfriend ate it anyways since he was hungry. When the server asked about the meals I let him know of the issues but all we got was a 'Sorry' (It wasn't his fault for the food though) and only 5% off the bill.

Paid $8 to valet just to eat at the Cheesecake Factory at the outlet mall sat at the bar top. I have been gone for a week traveling for work so it was the first time my husband and I got to sat down and catch up with each other and we decided to go here for lunch. Bartender was not friendly seemed to be inconvenienced that we sat down at the bar to eat. The lady who brought our bread was nice but the bread was burned. My husband enjoyed his turkey burger but my shrimp pasta was not good at all the shrimp was very rubbery and overcooked and the asparagus was not very good and limp. Bartender never came back to ask how our food was or I would have politely told him that I did not like my entree which he should have known as I did not finish it. He must have been in a rush to get us out of the bar as he already presented us our bill before we even got our entree in a glass cup in front of us!!! At the end of the meal my water glass was empty and did not even ask to refill it therefore we just paid the check and left. It is very unfortunate for the money I spent on our lunch to not only be satisfied with the food but also the service. Lastly we sat at the end of the bar by the well or the servers pick up the drinks and unfortunately it was surrounded by fruit flies as I kept swatting them away from our area of the bar.

10,Corrina R.,"Las Vegas, NV",56,180,771.0,1.0,2017-07-23,"This is an ultimate failure for a cheesecake factory.  When we arrive we didn't have to wait long, so that was pleasant.  Once they called my name to seat us knowing full well we have a small child and need a menu for him they didn't bring one.  They station us in a back area from the main dinning area. I didn't care so much about that, we did have to walk outside to go back inside to be seated.   Once we are seated and given our menus I realize we didn't get a kids menu and I asked for one.  The hostess never brought us one so we ended up having to ask the waitress what was available for children. This was after we had already sat at the table 15 minutes before we were even greeted by our waitress; who was overwhelmed.    We figure out what my son wants, we order drinks and food. We are asked if we want bread and we say yes. Then our waitress was off, we order water, sprite and a mojito.  We get our water and sprite about five minutes later and about fifteen minutes after that they bring my food and my husbands. I set timer and they bring my sons plate out, over five minutes later.   When I was done with my meal they finally bring my mojito (mind you, after I ordered it I said I'd walk back over and get it because it is pretty far from our seating area). They never did bring us bread and we never did see out waitress again because someone else brought our meals and drinks.  After we were done eating it took another fifteen minutes to get our check.  This was the most awful experience ever.  Poor time management and multitasking.  I think the manager needs some updated training.  He/she is way over their heads.   Our food wasn't bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-10,2.52,3.02,3.02,2.308,2.8200000000000003

The other two toilets were clogged. Ok. No big deal I guess. Get to our table the serour drink the menus are dirty; full of butter and food debris. But our server Brea is friendly and we're both restaurant managers, but we just got off so we're not doing that right now if you know what I mean. So, we order our drinks and the kids items as they are 1 and 3; its always easier to get them going. If you're a parent you understand. Once they eat, there's a small window where they are content to allow you to eat for a few minutes in peace. Well their food came out; they ate. Some time passed; they were getting antsy. Just as my husband and I are finally about to verbalize to each other the amount of time that we had waited, a man dressed in all black approached the table to regretfully inform us that they were out out an entree we'd ordered. We ordered something else. Remember that window I mentioned before? It came. And it went a long time ago. But we waited another 15 minutes. Here's where Brea fails. She sneaks up to the table and grabs our glasses and refills them ninja fast without making eye contact giving us a chance to ask about our order nor does she bother to communicate; something, anything. Op but here comes our food so forget it who cares. Oh wait, what? Taquitos and what? Oh, no wrong table. Sorry, that's not us but hey now let me just go ahead and speak to your manager. So, another 5 minutes goes by and now we just want any employee to come by so we can get the check for our drinks and kids meals. But not one employee passed by or even looked at our table until of course here comes our food and low and behold, guess what? ""Just kidding, I guess we had the chicken teriyaki afterall. So I just brought it all but I wont charge you for it."" So we waited for 55 minutes. The manager visited finally. He apologized, and didn't charge us for the items that they were out of,  but not out of, that we had to wait 55 minutes for. Yay us! We would have much rathered paid full price and not have waited. And then we look like asshole parents who let our kids do whatever they want; completely disrupting other guests. We had everything boxed up, paid the bill, and left.. communication is everything. Instead they tried to ignore it and they train-wrecked. We are super easy going; especially being in the business. This experience came down to training and communication or the lack thereof.

The server was okay, but he delivered our entrees at different times. Perhaps my pasta wasn't cold and sticky enough yet. Forty dollars for no-so-good two entrees and one drink is also a bit pricey, but I guess the marketing must be paid for as it seems they aren't spending good money on food product.

17,Kevin L.,"Las Vegas, NV",290,220,1043.0,2.0,2017-07-31,"Here's a simple transaction gone stupidly wrong. A man walks into a Cheesecake Factory 30-minutes to close. The place is less than half full, so it's not busy by any measure. All this man wants is to order two slices and to go home. He stands in front of the display case, as one does, waiting to ask a question and to then place an order.  And he keeps standing there.  There's one busy bee who's pulling all the weight filling orders as the dupes roll in. She's far too preoccupied, that is clear. Then there's the other, standing at the register, pretending to be busy. She looks at me on occasion, we make eye contact, and it's clear, I need help, and she's not busy, nor is she coming over. Maybe it's not her job? Maybe she's been scolded for leaving her register? I don't know. It's not my job to know. I wait a few more minutes watching the hustle. One manager comes in and gives the busy bee an understanding kiss on the head. Odd. Neither here nor there, though. I eventually walk over to the one whose feet are stuck at the register. She asks if I need anything. Incredulous, I say yes, and a question, but is there a reason you didn't come over when you saw me standing there forever?  ""I was busy."" No. No you weren't. And your muscles could have transported you over three feet to meet a customer. Anyway, I place my order, and there's not an ounce of hospitality in her voice or actions. No civility. Cold dismissiveness. I thank her for taking my money, but she continues to stand there. My cheesecake? No. She eyeballs the guy standing beside me, then back at me. Am I supposed to interpret this eyeballing? She then snarks at me to move, that, ""I need to take his order.""   ""THAT's interesting,"" I say. She has to take *his* before completing mine, after I've been standing there for ten minutes already. And how does that rule work if the line is more than two customers deep?  Have I wronged this woman somehow, in a past life perhaps? Just unreal. It's like she was stickin' it to me. For what? For being a customer?  While waiting for the next guy to place an infinitely long order before receiving mine, I see another manager come by. I tell HIM what just happened. He apologizes, which is nice, and he collects my cheesecake and hands it to me. Apologizes again. All that's well and good...but what are you going to do about that staffer (Sharonte, the receipt claims)? Let her look at me smugly as I leave, which she did, and let bygones be bygones?  Bad service is bad service, happens from time to time. But this felt weirdly personal, and as if no one cared whatsoever. Looking at other negative reviews, there's an obvious pattern here, as well as the textbook response from Management. Maybe try fixing your service issues instead of endlessly apologizing for them?  This Cheesecake is less than a mile from my house, but there's no way I'll ever return, not with that welcoming and sendoff as if I'd been punished for some unknown transgression.

I didn't really like the crust, a bit too bitter for my taste. The breaded shrimp was good and the cream sauce was fine.

If you don't want to wait to be seated, you can seat yourself in the bar area as those seatings are on a first come first serve basis.

Tonight we were pleasantly surprised!  I ordered the Tuscany chicken, it was hot and flavorful.  My boyfriend's chicken Madero was just how he ordered and he ate all of it.  When I went to the restroom, there was someone cleaning it and filling the TP!  Our server had a large party in our section due to a bday, but she handled it like a pro and was super attentive.  FINALLY, we feel it's the REAL CF and will come back!

We received the best service hands down from Robbie, The guy with the  man bun, blue glasses and big ol beard. At first he came by our table handed us some waters and bread and walked away and didn't say anything. We were like oh no, here we go again. Then he came back and offered to get us some drinks and such. Honestly, he's not your typical server, but it's what made us like him so much. He's not super bubbly and chatty and fake like half of the servers you get. He seems very genuine and thats what made us like him so much. Definitely will be back.  Robbie is awesome!!!  *** This was literally my first bad experience at the Cheesecake Factory EVER! Normally me and my fiancé come and have a great experience, great food, and overall great service. This time we didn't get to experience any of that.  This was our first time at this particular location. But since we come here so often, we already know what we want to eat. And this time we were on a slight time crunch, wanted to be in and out in an hour. We got sat on the patio, on a Wednesday afternoon. It was a pretty slow section. There were only 3 or 4 tables. So when the server first greeted us, we immediately ordered our food when we ordered our drinks. That was at 2:30, so 15 minutes goes by and our server accidentally takes a fall and hurts herself, breaking glasses and such. She went to the back to get iced up I believe. With all the servers they had all day, you'd think they'd get someone to cover her section. But all we really got was a walk by from a manager asking if we were ok. 35 minutes goes by. And we still don't have our food. Our waitress was back out on the floor.  At that point I just wanted to walk out, but we did order drinks and still had to pay for them. And my fiancé was starving, so we asked to get our food Togo. 45 minutes later, we get our food Togo. I asked to get our delicious strawberry lemonade Togo, and they gave us a tiny kids cup filled with ice to go with our meal. As we walked out, I told the manager that stopped by our table earlier that our service was terrible, and all he had to say was that he was unaware of it. We understand our server did get hurt but that doesn't make up for the terrible service. Especially since there's 20+ servers working on the floor at the time. We don't eat at Cheesecake to eat takeout, we choose to eat at Cheesecake for the experience, and this Cheesecake Factory restaurant completely failed us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-10?start=20,3.16,3.05,3.05,,3.094

Well we live in California and we were on our way home when we realized that they had given us cheesecake not cake. I called and asked for a manager and Andrew is a ""manager"" and told me he couldn't do anything about it because it had been over an hour? Uhm HELLO!!!! It's VEGAS! Whether I lived in California or not what does the time matter?! You're telling a customer they can't go back and return something they didn't ask for?! At least exchange it. The employees really do need to pay attention to what customers are asking for. This is a tourist city and your restaurant is in a tourist area!!!!!! Pay attention for what people ask for! Not everyone has the chance to eat here all the time or to be wasting money on something they don't want just because you can't pay attention and your lousy manager can't fix your mistakes! Will never come back here again. I have family in Vegas so I'm always coming down here and they said they've always had a problem with this specific facility whether it's service or food not being prepared right or cold.

The menu is huge, so it took us a few minutes. And it doesn't have photos anymore so I was looking on my phone to get a better idea of what I was going to eat. I ordered a lunch portion of the chicken, mango and avocado salad without wonton and skinny pomegranate dressing on the side. JD ordered the sandwich, soup and salad lunch combo. My salad arrived and looked so sad. The chicken beast it's self was flat. It wasn't plump and juicy. It looked like it had been sitting in a freezer with a 100 lb weight on it. See photos. There was hardly any avocado- maybe 1/4 of one. No almonds to be found. The fruit was definitely not fresh. I was able to squish it so easily with a fork. It had been sitting in a can. You can always tell the difference between fresh, frozen and canned fruit. Nice try with trying to pull a fast one though. When we told our server what was wrong, she made me feel that this was somehow my fault- as did the manager. I'm sorry I didn't want crispy wontons on my salad and that I subbed dressings. It felt like that was what started this whole issue.  They comped the salad, we canceled the cheesecake slice we were going to share at the end of our meal because giving them more money after the way we were treated simply wasn't an option.  It's unfortunate that this is the first time I've been to a Cheesecake Factory in about 6 years and that it went so poorly. Definitely reminds me why I generally stray away from chains like this.

This review is specifically aimed for this location.  This was my first time to this property. I came tonight for a birthday party. Now I understand large groups can be challenging but with that being said there were still some awkward moments. I arrived and when I asked for my party the girl at the front just gave me half ass directions. She told me to go through the double doors. The only double doors I saw looked like an exit outside so I just kind of roamed around aimlessly until I was able to stop and ask another employee where to go. So those double doors that led out were correct. So they have doors that go outside first and then there is another set of doors leading to a separate room. But come on.... I know I couldn't have been the first person to be confused by the layout. It wouldn't have killed her to give a little more detail. Our server was nice and personable. I ordered the Louisiana pasta. Tasty but not really memorable. The lady next to me ordered the salmon which she said was fantastic. Two people on opposite ends of the table ordered the shrimp angel hair pasta and they both said the shrimp was WAY over cooked, rubbery and a lot of shell. See no one really checked on how the meal was until we were all almost done. Since it was a birthday my friend was trying to be discreet and let the server know about the dissatisfaction with the shrimp on two dishes. His response was that she should have let him no sooner. And yes... she should have. But no one came by to check. So was she supposed to interrupt dinner to find someone. Again, it was a birthday party and she didn't want to make a scene. Then the check came without offering anyone dessert. Yes.... dessert came for the birthday girl. So that should have been a great time to ask anyone if they would like to finish it off with something sweet. When my check was handed to me I asked for a piece to go and was told I would have to have two separate checks. Ok fine. I guess it's somehow my fault I wasn't offered dessert before the check. 2 bills then. Whatever. Just bring me my cheesecake please....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-10?start=20,3.04,2.96,2.96,,2.9920000000000004

5,Anny D.,"Claremont, CA",13,105,21.0,4.0,2017-12-29,"One thing to rely on when visiting chains, food tastes the same. Always get my usual and a nice cheesecake to finish. What makes this one any different? Customer service! He was very patient with my kiddos. Even after a spill, he was still all smiles and very attentive to our requests. Menu choices: chicken madeira, crusted chicken Romano, pasta carbonara, pumpkin swirl cheesecake. All great!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-10,2.92,2.98,2.98,,2.956
1,Priscilla Y.,"Vancouver, Canada",104,497,1708.0,3.0,2017-12-30,"it was an extremely long wit for a seat here at lunch (it always is) but their food is large portioned, decently priced and classic american fare. My friends LOVE their pasta and were happy with their creamy choices while my chicken tacos were good, but not amazing. The avocado was brown and the shells broke with the amount of salsa they put at the BOTTOM of the tacos... Service was also extremely slow and we were hardly attended to but the tiramisu cheesecake is probably my new favourite! Not too heavy, plenty of cake and coffee flavour too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-10,2.96,3.0,3.0,,2.9840000000000004
11,Nancy B.,"Las Vegas, NV",66,7,,5.0,2018-01-06,Could not believe how good my meal was - and reasonably priced.  Carly was a great waitress.  She was personable and had great information about the massive menu. I had lime-coconut chicken that was amazingly good. The banana cream cheesecake is worth saving room for!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-10,3.12,3.04,3.04,,3.0720000000000005
9,Caitlin W.,"Las Vegas, NV",28,1,,2.0,2018-01-09,"One of my favorite places, but last night I was very disappointed. Our server didn't greet herself so I don't even know her name, but we had found hair in our food so of course we asked for our server and she simply said ""Oh I'm sorry"" did not get the manager or anything to fix the problem. I'm usually very easy going but seriously the customer service was TERRIBLE last night especially for how nice the restaurant is supposed to be for the price. Definitely won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-10,3.16,3.03,3.03,,3.082
