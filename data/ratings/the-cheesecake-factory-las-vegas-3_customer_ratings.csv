218,Harriet W.,"San Francisco, CA",626,381,484.0,2.0,2012-01-09,"Actually, this was my first time at a Cheesecake Factory, and surprisingly, I wasn't that impressed with the food.  Maybe I didn't order the right dish.  I ordered a fettuccine alfredo and it was just overall nothing special. I tried to eat as much as I could because it was the last meal before heading to the airport to go back home, and I'd get hungry if I didn't eat.  But anyway, I felt like I could've probably whipped up a better fettuccine alreado at home if I tried. On the other hand, I did like my boyfriend's pasta dish a lot more.  We didn't get a cheesecake, since we were already full. (Well, I forced myself to eat as much as I could. haha) Hopefully, I'll be more impressed with another dish or just different location of the Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=380,3.92,3.64,3.64,3.3680000000000003,3.7520000000000002

This one was located inside of the Forum Shops at Caesers. Outside of the restaurant was very crowded due to customers going in and out and the little fire show that goes on right outside of the restaurant. I'm glad we asked for seats deeper inside because we ended up getting a 2 person booth which was way more quite and had more of a private feel to it.  The service we received here was excellent. Everything we asked for got there in no time by one of the waiters even if we had asked another one of them. We were impressed. The food was good too. I have some chicken pesto pasta dish and my husband got the fish tacos. We both liked our food and the Adios Long Island drinks were strong and awesome.  We really had a good time at this place but were just too full by the end to try any of their cheesecake desserts - which means we will have to go back for another visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=400,3.92,3.63,3.63,3.632,3.746
456,Carly L.,"Eastvale, CA",11,51,,3.0,2012-01-15,"As expected, cheese cake factory doesn't really differ much to location. I came here with my friends for lunch since we were in vegas for the weekend. The wait was only 15-20 minutes and since we were there for lunch we weren't sure how the portions were. We only had dinner at cheesecake and never lunch. So we asked about the lunch portions and still it was huge. My friend and I ended up sharing the BBQ chicken cobb salad which I absolutely love and my other friend got their fish and chips. Service was fine. They were quick to get things to your table and our server was super nice. The food was the same as the one near brea mall, but it seemed the one here in vegas paid more attention to it because our salad wasn't drenched in the dressing. It seemed to be perfected dressed and you can taste the different tastes rather than everything having one flavor. That was probably the distinction between the two places which was nice for a change.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=400,3.88,3.63,3.63,3.564,3.73

Although i didn't taste much alcohol in it but it's delicious! I use to only order the Navajo sandwich which has chicken, avocado, tomato, onions, lettuce in a fry bread. But then I started ordering the MISO SALMON. & Oh my goodness!!! My new favorite dish. Salmon was cooked to perfection, very moist, and was on top of a bead of rice. Surrounding the rice was some kind of creamy white sauce which was amazing and compliments the dish very well, along with chikapeas. I asked the server what sauce it was and she said its some kind of lemon sauce which didn't taste like it at all. Seemed like it has some mayo in it mixed with something else. My mom said it tasted like it had some coconut cream in it. I'll have to ask the server again.

We were wondering around the Forum when we realized a break was need. So we stopped in Cheesecake and got ourselves some much needed water and nachos (food in general was need so we went with nachos). The plate was huge and delicious but they may have just been because of my state of mind. Any way this is a pretty normal cheesecake. It looks pretty nice but in reality they are all about the same.

354,Caroline J.,"Henderson, NV",182,123,42.0,4.0,2012-03-19,"In general, I try to avoid chain restaurants because if it is a chain I can eat their food all throughout the country. Also, I have seen Cheesecake Factory's gluten free menu and it contained close to nothing for me to eat without morphing the dish into something remarkably healthy (no sauce, dressing, fries, etc). Now, there are times that I want to be healthy, but that's why I cook at home, not when I go to a restaurant called CHEESECAKE Factory. Therefore, my fiance have avoided this restaurant in Caesar's until St. Patrick's Day when friends wanted something familiar to eat. First, the hostess desk was on top of their game. I got a piece of paper with my approximate waiting time and the time I checked into the desk. They took my phone number to call me when my table was ready which is GENIUS in Vegas. We stayed within the casino, so when they called we came running and the table was ready. Service? It was actually pretty good. I didn't walk away wow-ed by the service, but it was good. Our waters were almost always full, my friends got refills on the bread, butter and alcoholic drinks relatively fast and all went okay. The server split our bills with the greatest of ease since we told him at the beginning of the meal we'd prefer split bills. CF gets the extra 1 star for the host desk organization and service alone. Yes, this menu is impressive. Salads, pizzas, Chinese, Italian and of course, massive amounts of cheesecake. I looked through the menu and saw the plethora of carb-tastic happiness. I saw a stack of onion straws go by me and I remembered my days of gluten-ingesting intestinal pain. However, I think that stack of onion straws, the flatbread and the pasta could absolutely be worth it. The menu for you gluten-lovers is great. Somewhat predictable, but great.  My friends eating gluten all loved their food! My fiance got a basic burger, another got the Steak Diane, one got the Kobe burger with American cheese (wrong cheese, but moving forward) and the last guy got the Mac and Cheese burger. I ordered the safest item on the menu for someone that is gluten free which is the lemon and herb chicken with mashed potatoes. It seemed safe at the time, and even though I wasn't starving, I didn't want to be ill for the rest of the night.  Nobody complained about their food. Everyone said it was great and that they were completely satisfied with their meals. The fries looked pretty standard. I expected a little more pizazz with their fries since everything else was so extravagant, but they were simple. The burgers did not look appealing to me, and I love beef, but then again, everyone except my fiance ordered their cow medium and that hurts my heart. My chicken? Hands down some of the best chicken I've ever had at a restaurant. The best thing? There were bones in the chicken, but the large ones were removed and the chicken came right off the bone. Don't even get me started on the magic wonder of the lemon butter sauce. I could have clogged my arteries with more of that sauce any day. I didn't get sick from the restaurant, and that chicken may pull me back one of these days. Please feel free to take away the red mashed potatoes which were okay, but nothing exciting and almost didn't deserve to be on the plate with that butter and chicken. Replace the potatoes with more chicken and we're good. I know this one was long, but I like to approach a meal from all different angles. I wanted to give this restaurant 3 stars because for me, the GF options were severely lacking for a major chain restaurant, but what I did eat was great and the restaurant organization was on-point. If you want something that's not specifically Vegas but reliable and perfect for picky eaters, come to Cheesecake Factory and you'll be happy with your choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=460,3.92,3.69,3.69,3.664,3.782

452,Ron H.,"San Clemente, CA",55,46,86.0,2.0,2012-05-02,"It was our first night staying at Caesars and I was a bit worn out from the drive, so I didn't feel like going too far for dinner. At about 8:30 we went into the Forum Shops area and found a number of places that looked good. One of the last we ran across was the Cheesecake Factory. We didn't want anything that fancy and had dined at different Cheesecake Factory restaurants many times so we decided that this would be fine. We ordered a Chicken Caesar salad and a Pizza. While we were waiting, all of a sudden, loud throbbing music filled the indoor courtyard. We asked the server what was going on and were told that the Nike store next door was having a promotion or kick-off of some sort. The music was a non-stop throbbing `new-age' sound which was NOT pleasant. The Pizza was eventually served, but w/out the Chicken Caesar salad. While sharing the pizza, the music suddenly stopped. Yea! A bit of peace and quiet... NOT! Within just minutes there was an explosion and flames coming from the top of the aquarium in the center of the indoor courtyard. Then large animated figurines rose from amidst the flames and went into a `skit' for the people on the other side of the aquarium. It, too, was almost deafening w/ continued explosions and background sounds. As it was directed away from us we could not make out the dialog, just the explosions and screaming. Well, we're on our second piece of pizza and the manager comes to the table stating that the Chicken Caesar salad would be a bit longer. I told him to forget it. He asked if I was sure and I replied, 'yes'. So, as we're starting our 3rd (and last) slice of pizza... out comes the Chicken Caesar salad. Plop... not a word... and the server (not our waiter) walks away. I nibbled at it, but wasn't that hungry and left most in the bowl. Just as we are about to ask for the check the `skit' ends. Yea! A bit of peace and quiet... NOT! The Nike noise returns... along with the check which includes the Chicken Caesar. I run down the server and recant my conversation w/ the manager. He says he'll look into it and after about 5 minutes returns with the check w/o the Chicken Caesar. At this point all we wanted to do was leave, so we didn't wait for change, leaving a 25%+ tip for service worth about 10% and an experience worth avoiding.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=400,3.84,3.7,3.7,3.5280000000000005,3.7560000000000002

We went there at 8 PM on a Friday night, and there was an anticipated 35 minute wait - but they gave us a piece of paper and told us to come back in half an hour.  That gave us time to check out the nearby stores and watch the ""Fall of Atlantis"" show right outside.  Unfortunately, it took an extra ten minutes before the anticipated time before we got seated and the kids were quite tired by then. The prices were pretty reasonable. My Monterey burger came with cheese, onions, arugula and avocado an was $12, plus an extra one to substitute the fries with sweet potato fries.  The burger was good, though not as juicy as I'd like it (I ordered it medium rare), but the fries were phenomenal.   My oldest had the pasta alfredo ($7), but she was disappointed by the lack of flavor.  Unfortunately our waiter was too busy so we seldom saw him and we couldn't ask him for Parmessan cheese before she was finished.  My youngest had the kids cheese pizza ($6), which was the size of a regular dinner plate - basically, adult size.  The pizza tasted like an Italian pizza margherita rather than your typical American cheese pizza, so she didn't like it.  I, however, did.  All the portions were large enough that we all took leftovers to our hotel (which fortunately has a kitchenette). Of course, the only reason why the kids were willing to go to the Cheesecake Factory was the name, so we went on to have cheesecake.  The HUGE slices were $7 each, very reasonable IMHO, but I come from a city where food is grossly overpriced.  I had the Adam's Peanut Butter fudge cheesecake, and I would not recommend it.  It was way too sweet to allow for any cheesecake flavor to filter through.  My oldest had the Dulce de Leche cheesecake, which she enjoyed.  I liked it more than mine because it was less sweet, but next time I'll go for the plain cheesecake.  My youngest had the kids hot fudge sundae ($2!).  It was a large enough portion that she couldn't finish it. In all, if you can deal with the wait and share dishes (or take the leftovers home for later), this seems like a good and reasonably priced place to dine in Vegas - no wonder there was such a huge wait!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=420,4.12,3.86,3.86,3.152,3.9640000000000004

We were looking for a place to eat breakfast/lunch on a Saturday morning, and so many of the restaurants were packed and had 45-minute waits. So we walked around the Forum Shops, and there was The Cheesecake Factory, a beacon amid a sea of overpriced stores! We had to go in. And get this: No wait for a table! We sat upstairs on the second floor. This place is huge, by the way. Plenty of seating.  Their menu is also huge, so bring your reading glasses. For an appetizer, we ordered the Made-to-Order Guacamole, which was very good and came with tortilla chips, salsa and sour cream - all of the necessary condiments to go along with chips! For an entree, I got the Southwest Chicken Sandwich, which had grilled chicken, avocado, tomato, onion, cilantro and chipotle mayo on Toasted French bread. It's also served with jalapenos, but I asked that they don't put them on there, and I'm glad I did because this sandwich definitely had a kick to it. It was really good, though, and I used some of the leftover guacamole from our appetizer on my sandwich, which made it extra good.  Then, of course, we had to get cheesecake.

It was pretty great!  I was very pleased when in the mixed veggies a little bit of squash and eggplant was mixed in, it wasn't your basic green beans and carrots.  Although, there was green beans and carrots!  But it was all so good!  Service was very kind, prompt, although I had to ask 3 times for a straw and still never received one!   The wait on a Friday night wasn't long, I think we got there at a good time because it was packed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=440,4.12,3.88,3.88,3.088,3.976

First off, you claim you have a full bar, yet you couldn't make a blood and sand. Then when I asked the waitress for a sazarac, she replied that she had no idea what that was before even consulting with the bar. When she did talk to them, they had o idea what it was either. Come onnnnn, thats America's first cocktail. Standard drink. I'm female and fresh out if college, and even I know what it is. A good bartender would've looked it up on their phone or have had a cocktail book stored at their register. After the huge ordeal, I succumbed to the firefly martini... It had tequila so I was good... For the time being... My mom had specifically ordered a medium burger. Not only was her burger late coming to the table, it was also a brick. When we told the waitress, she looked so annoyed with us, grabbed the burger plus my mom's fries, without asking. The very insincere manager came over to tell us he took it off the bill, and offered to grab us something else. Anywhere else would've comped the burger and whatever else we ordered for her wait. My fish and chips were decent...  Not mind blowing.  Extreme oreo cheesecake was far too sweet.

Me and my friends typically make our way to this place around 9 or so, about an hour before it closes and the place is usually not that crowded, or winding down.

I've never had any complaints. It's so delicious that even if I'm too full after a meal, I'll still take cheesecake to go. Chocolate Godiva cheesecake is the cheesecake of gods and it descended from the heavens into this restaurant and if you don't eat it, you're wrong. Forshame! The food can be hit or miss. Typically their Asian cuisine is pretty spot on. It may not be authentic, but it sure is tasty. I think the only bad thing I've ever really had here is the chicken and biscuits. It's like, swimming in gravy, and I hate soup. Their veggie burger is kinda sad too, just fell apart in my hands. Steak is definitely the way to go. The alcoholic drinks are good game too.

I got the French toast. Overall, it wasn't bad. It was cooked well and the inside was nice and custardy. It wasn't too sweet either, which I really don't like on my French toasts, so that was a good thing! It was ok, didn't blow me away, but wasn't disappointing either. The service was great.

Not only did we have one of our better nights here, but we actually spent about 4 hours sitting at the bar. No lie. That was our second night in a row there.  Our first night, we came for dinner and didn't feel like waiting 45 minutes for a table. We quickly snagged a corner seat at the bar and were helped by Jeremy (The guy that looks like ""the guy from Jarhead"" aka Jake Gyllenhaal). We both ordered the fish tacos, but Jeremy suggested the plate was big and we could probably split it, which we ended up doing and didn't regret it because it was a LOT. The only gripe I would have is that the rice was strange. I have no idea what was in it, but it was strange. He was quick and attentive-- perfect dinner service!  The next night, we opted going straight to the bar again, and were helped by Jose & William. William, hands down, knows which dishes are worth getting and will steer you away from something you may regret ordering later. HANDS DOWN this guy's got the menu memorized. I even was able to test his knowledge about what was in certain dishes, and he was able to answer without hesitation; and if anyone's ever been in the Cheesecake Factory, you know their menus are 80-page books. He was able to suggest the Miso Salmon & the Veggie Salad, both of which we ordered and were NOT disappointed (seriously, order these items). He can also make a mean ""Jolly Rancher"" shot! Jose was one of my favorite bartenders... basically ever. This guy's been bartending for 8 years, and you can really tell. He has an awesome attitude, a great smile, and is efficient as heck (he also bartends events, so if you're ever looking to find someone to do your event, he's your man!) He can make great conversation, tell some insane stories, but will still finish the hundreds of drink orders that are coming in. I feel like after the 4 hours we spent sitting at the bar, we made some great Cheesecake Factory friends. I wish this particular CF were local, but alas, anything in Vegas stays in Vegas, and I guess that goes for the bartenders/service we've had here.

I waited AGAIN upstairs. And then asked to sit in an overcrowded, stuffy, overflow room.  And get this, the table was a small 2 top right outside of the kitchen. Literally, 3 steps out of the kitchen. Lord forbid a waiter trip or a cup of coffee slip off of a tray, scolded wouldn't even be the word. Myself and my guest I was with, just left.   As we walked down the grand staircase, we walked past a manager that didn't even take the time to say goodbye or ask about the meal. The gentleman that directed us upstairs didn't even take the time to ask why we were leaving so soon, but instead ""I hope you enjoyed your meal!"" Bro, we weren't even here for more than 10 minutes. Ultimately, I get that this location in Vegas is busy, but why is that? Cheesecake factory is a staple in every major city, patrons will eat there no matter what city they are traveling to.  But what i don't get is how the customer service can waiver between the different locations.  Just because the Vegas location stays packed from open to close, shouldn't mean that the hostess cannot take an extra moment while asking a name, ""just to let you know, we are seating in the upstairs overflow room, is that okay? Or would you prefer to wait for a table on the first floor?""  This one question would have given me a 5 star experience because I would have elected to walk up approximately 42 stairs and sit in a separated environment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=280,3.96,3.9,3.9,3.3000000000000003,3.9240000000000004

I ordered the calamari and it was good. Ive had it before so I knew what to expect. My server was excellent. She was attentive the whole time and I always had what I needed.

I wold think that at the beginning of the day they would have all flavors available so that was annoying. I opted for the white chocolate raspberry and I was not impressed. I expected to be better than it was so that was a bust. I did not spend a lot of time there. I just kind of got in and got out kind of thing so there is nothing else to really review.

I only have one complaint.  Stop discontinuing my favotite sandwiches.  They used to make a three cheese Grilled Cheese sandwich which was awesome.  They also used to make a Monterey Cheeseburger which was the bomb.  I truly miss those two items.   With that being said, every time we return to Caesars Palace, going to this Cheesecake Factory is a must.  Many good memories here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=160,4.16,3.91,3.91,3.7960000000000003,4.01

I like that this location is quite large and that there are 2 floors of seating, although it can get pretty packed on the weekends and around dinner time. The menu is extensive so ordering is a task in itself lol. Somehow though, I always revert to my favorite Miso salmon, brown rice in lieu of white. Hubby got the Mac and Cheese burger which was cooked perfectly, rich and flavorsome. The madre got the Louisiana Chicken pasta which she thoroughly enjoyed. We also had a taste of the fish tacos which were surprisingly good, the cilantro rice is one of the best I've tried. On the kids menu: chicken tenders and fries, well it's chicken tenders and fries, nothing much to elaborate. The mac and cheese that my son ordered was unsavory to put it mildly. It was dry and bland with no flavor profile at all. Our server must've noticed my sons dislike as he took one bite and ceased eating altogether hahaha so he offered to get him something else, my son wasn't feeling very well so he opted for the bread basket instead. Our server informed us he would have the mac and cheese taken out of the bill, we told him it wasn't necessary but he insisted. A red velvet cheesecake was shared amongst us as we were too stuffed to order more. Service was cordial and timely despite the dinner rush.

They have sun dried tomato and plenty avocado in them, and to go along with it, is the sweet cilantro dipping sauce. So far I've gone there 3 times in the last month in a half. This is a must try, if you don't eat meat and love avocados. Of course they have a long list of different cheesecakes, I always stick to strawberry cheesecake.

Ordered their Ribeye Steak medium rare with Mac & cheese and Mash potatoes. I judge a lot of restaurants based off of their ability to cook steak correctly. I'm no snob or highly experienced chef but cooking steak isn't exactly easy so if a restaurant can cook a steak properly, it gets major kudos from me. They not only cooked my steak perfectly but even the cut itself was of high quality. Maybe I'm exaggerating but it tasted and looked perfect.

Next a large cup of spicy Tortilla Soup that would be labeled a ""bowl"" most everywhere else contained a pleasant but unusual concoction of rice- and corn-filled enchilada-flavored liquid.  Complimentary Brown Bread was excellent. Although by this time more food was hardly necessary, a packed California Cheesesteak that was filled with thinly sliced grilled steak, onions, peppers, and melted cheese, and covered with sauteed mushrooms inside a toasted Ciabatta Roll, was nicely done.  Accompanying French Fries were good, and the Cole Slaw that went with Diane's Fried Shrimp Platter was cool and creamy.  Obviously there was no further room for dessert, so it was forsworn.         Delivery was late on Diane's ordered Root Beer.  Otherwise service was very attentive.  A California casual atmosphere well suited my choice of sandwich.   XXXX-1/2 Overall!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=80,4.32,4.09,3.936,3.536,4.182

We went to the Cheesecake Factory, having never been to one before. As it was in Caesars Palace, I was expecting inflated prices, however I was pleasantly surprised with the menu pricing. The spinach, artichoke and cheese dip was great and the pizza and jerk chicken for main were both fresh and tasty. We took a slice of cheesecake to go (too full to eat after the starter and main) and it was lovely. The price level was decent, especially considering the quality of food you get. A good experience! Our waiter was fast and friendly and offered advice on the huge menu (I mean it when I say there is something for everyone!!).  My husband had the Meatballs, my sister had a pizza and I had a steak. All the meals were well prepared and very well presented. My steak was cooked as I like it, medium rare. Following the meal we chose deserts and again they were really nice, and surprising value. The low light was the Fettucine Alfredo. Very little sauce, very little flavour. Very disappointing. Both the meal and desert portions were large, perhaps a little too large for me and I have a great apatite. The portion and value are great here and the food is very decent, though not so much on the healthy side (they do have a 'skinny menu' meant for those who are calorie conscious).

They have like 20 pages of food and it's like reading a damn book, trying to get through the whole menu and trying to figure out what you want. That's like a 10 min ordeal just going through all those pages and by that time, you really worked up an appetite. With such a huge selection, how does the company expect to make good food and perfect a dish? They can't with 100 dishes they have to cook and remember. Id just shoot myself if I was the chef and had to memorize that menu and try to cook it. Condense the menu and make at least one thing right and delicious.  The pasta I got was bland and said light marinara. It was drenched in Mariana and it was suppose to have a lemon and garlic taste. Didn't taste anything but bland tomato sauce. My bf got chicken and biscuits. The chicken was a joke. It looked like thin floppy slices that you get from a container to.make sandwiches. Im not even sure if it was chicken.

I think this is at least my 30th time at cheese cake factory, it just always ends up being the go to place for food for the people in my life.  I ordered the 4 cheese pasta and man was it gear. Very cheesy and very rich in flavor. I believe it was topped with ricotta and mixing that in with everything made the texture especially delicious.  Also had the margarita pizza. The thing about that pizza is it's not too heavy or greasy. The sauce is where it's at and its not a splatter of tomato sauce. It's smooth and hits the spot. Definitely a step up from cheese pizza, there isn't much of a difference anyway so I would say to just go for the margarita.  I ate an ahi appetizer, forgot what it's called but it was delicious... Except it was a tad bit expensive for the amount I got. I was expecting bigger chunks of ahi but I understand that ahi is an expensive fish. I have yet to really understand the world of expensive food but I am getting there.  Also the bread. Gotta love a place the gives out free bread.  Overall, great place.

They are also very receptive and come around very quickly to make sure you are taken care of.

I would have preferred rolled up cutlery or at least placed on top of a napkin. Aside from that it's a great place to eat while staying in Vegas. Oh, one last thing.

SO good!!! I wish I would've gotten my waiters name because he was awesome! I ordered the combo of the steak Diana with salmon and it was delicious.

62,Daniel S.,"Henderson, NV",990,1138,6858.0,4.0,2016-03-27,"When in Rome do as the Roman's do. A popular thing to do in this Roman themed mall is to visit the Cheesecake Factory. At the Forum Shops, all roads lead to the Cheesecake Factory located where the main corridor concludes at the Journey to Atlantis Show.     It seems that the time I initially started visiting this Cheesecake Factory is older than the statues and columns that border this Roman themed mall. In a sense this is partially true considering that my visits go back long ago prior to the Forum Shops expansion when Virgin Records was the cool place to visit during the George W. Bush administration. Today, at the end of the Obama administration, the food and dining experience here is just as good as when George W. Bush was in office.     This Cheesecake Factory is usually busy. There is quite a difference waiting here than an uninteresting  place such as the DMV. Here, patrons wait in an area with the sounds and sights of Rome. Where else can you wait for dinner while watching statues above a 50,000 gallon aquarium come to life to battle it out in the ""Fall of Atlantis""? Waiting gets even better with the signature cheesecake displays at the other side of the hostess. Waiting would be even better if there was no waiting. The Cheesecake Factory has yet to offer the texting or beeper system.     The Cheesecake Factory is a spacious and attractive restaurant that includes tables overlooking the ""Fall of Atlantis"" show. The tables deep inside the restaurant are envoloped in an elegant interior. On the majority of my visits including the latest, we sat deep in the restaurant.     The Cheesecake menu is to restaurants what the nearby 50,000 gallon aquarium is to aquariums: Giantic! As soon as I saw eggplant parmesan with pesto pasta, on this visit I instantaneously bypassed around 250 other choices. Eggplant parmesan is one of my favorite dishes. I was so :-) to see it on the menu. With that said, in the past I have enjoyed commendable sandwiches including the eggplant parmesan sandwich, burgers, and a BLT. The eggplant parmesan with pesto pasta is reasonably priced at $14.95. Unlike some restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip, this is not a tourist trap. With the entree, I ordered bottomless Coke. Ahead of the dinner, the attentive waiter served us bread with butter.   The eggplant parmesan was delicious with a capital D. The Cheesecake Factory style of serving eggplant parmesan is separate round pieces bordering pesto pasta. Every bite of the eggplant parmesan covered with mozzarella cheese, fontina cheese, and marina cheese made me feel like a Roman emperor. Likewise I relished the taste of the pesto pasta. This is the first time that a restaurant served eggplant parmesan with pesto pasta. Cheesecake Factory had broke the tradition of serving eggplant parmesan with pasta under marinara sauce. Regardless, I truly enjoyed it. The dinner was so enjoyable that time went fast, and before you knew it we were leaving Rome for the Las Vegas Strip. It's just a shame that I never leave enough room for the cheesecake.    I have been a fan of this Cheesecake Factory going back years prior to holding a smartphone when Virgin Records was the attraction. This dining environment inside a faux Ancient Rome overlooking a 50,000 gallon aquarium where statues come to life to battle it out in the ""Fall of Atlantis"" show is exclusive. The generous menu offers several choices from the cheeseburger to eggplant parmesan. The prices are reasonable. And the service has always been solid. In conclusion, Julius Caesar would be proud of the Forum Shops Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=40,4.08,3.67,3.856,3.3760000000000003,3.834

So today when I picked up my food and got back to my store I opened and was disappointed in the portion, knowing it is off the ""skinnilicous"" menu so it is supposed to be smaller portion but this was beyond small.... 4 tiny pieces of steak and a scoop of mashed and maybe 3 small pieces of asparagus. I was bummed but what ever I didn't have time to get anything else, I was about to start eating when I noticed a piece of plastic in it, looked like a piece of tape, but at least a inch long   I called and asked to speak to a manager, she said to bring it back so they can see it and they'll start a new one right away and throw in a piece of cheesecake.  I get there the to go lady was nice, she says they are making a new one now.... I wait prob 10 mins get back to my store and open it. No tape but seriously gave me the same container of food back.

It was extremely cold in here...I wish I had brought a jacket. We knew the portions here are huge, so decided to share an appetizer of crispy crab wontons and one entree of the alfredo fettuccine with mushrooms and chicken. The crab wontons came out quickly. They were extremely hot and we burned our tongues on them. ): They tasted great though! The pasta came out soon after. The pasta was heavy and filled us up quickly. Even though we were sharing all of this, we almost didn't order dessert. ALMOST. How can you go to the Cheesecake Factory and not order cheesecake?! We ended up ordering a chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake. It was delicious. Lots of gooey cookie dough pieces in the middle. We were only able to finish half of it because we were so full.

After a short wait, we were taken to a nice booth seat, and our server came right away. We ordered some cocktails and th buffalo chicken as appetizers. Their cocktails are pretty big for their price and they tasted very good- we ordered blood orange margarita, blood orange mojito and pina colada. With our cocktails, the server brought us some warm breads with butter, which were good as well.  The buffalo chicken was a deep fried dish of buffalo marinaded chicken chunks. However, there wasn't enough cheese or chicken inside the fried skin, so we had to end up just digging for the chicken to not get full from the fried part. As soon as we were done with our appetizers, our pastas were served. The portions were enourmous, like how cheesecake serves all their foods.  Along with two bowtie pastas that my friends ordered which seemed fine, my shrimp scampi failed. The angel hair was dry when serves, there was no sauce, and it seemed like it was waiting for the kitchen line for awhile to be served. The shrimp was not sauteed as mentioned on their description but it was deep fried-and remember their appetizer was heavily fried as well. There was just not enough sauce for the whole dish to feel moist. The shrimps were so heavy that it did not go well with the angel hair. Also, their garlics were not sliced at all; but served in chunks.  Their service was good, but if I were to go back again, I would stay with the skinny side of their menu, since they do not deep fry every ingredient.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=40,4.16,3.79,3.844,2.9240000000000004,3.938

Our waitress appeared disheveled, and she certainly wasn't very efficient. We waited more than one hour for our food, and the food is quite simple. The restaurant was also not very busy. We had a burrito, a salad, lettuce wrap tacos, and a cheese only omelette. Normally this would be served up in 25 to 35 minutes. When the food get arrived, we pointed out to the waitress that one of the classes was horribly dirty, with a big brown ring around the inside of it. She wished it away, and laughed about it. Later, she returned again laughing, and said, don't worry about it, it was only a bad stain and not scum on the inside of the glass. Overall, a great disappointment and we will definitely not be returning to this particular location.

I was like okay I was about to ask the host. The host said it was fine & guess who was our waitress for the booth? The same rude waitress who told us we couldn't sit there meaning that it was most likely a part of her section. In my experience as a waitress, if my guests wanted to move to another table in my section they would be more then welcome to & not scolded. The worst part of our experience was we ordered our food and didn't get it until about an hour later. After the wait, you would think the food would be prepared well but both of our pasta dishes were dry. We had our waitress bring it back & the manager Aaron brought it to us & apologized. This occurred after the screw up which took up to an hour plus of our time. After arriving at 10pm & not getting our food till 11:10pm we were tired & just wanted to leave because we literally were one of the last tables before close.

Bacon & onion rings were crispy. The patty was juicy medium. It came with fries so this was definitely a filling lunch for $12. My friend got the Factory Burger and said that it was also good.

The menu is HUGE. I had never been before at any other location, and i was mesmerized by the size of the menu and how many calories each dish contained. Eff it, I was on vacation. The lady and I started with toasted avocado bread, which is what it sounds like: toasted bread topped with avocada. It was actually pretty good, and is a good hangover cure if you're not feeling too hot. For our lunches we each ordered salads. It was called the chicken avocada salad or something similar, and it was a LARGE salad. One of the biggest i have eaten in my life, actually. It was covered in guac, chicken, black beans, tortilla strips, corn... just a lot of stuff packed in, and I could barely even finish it. I also had a frozen strawberry margarita. Recommended.

29,Judy C.,"Honolulu, HI",497,483,7846.0,5.0,2017-04-05,"Happy 400th Review and I am dedicating #400 to The Cheesecake Factory.  Why The Cheesecake Factory?  The Reason: This Cheesecake Factory location holds special memories I will never ever forget, I celebrated most of my anniversaries here at this Cheesecake Factory location, the very first celebration was our 7th, which I remember like it was yesterday. We have been back every year,since our 7th. That's many anniversaries here!!  This recent anniversary was our 21st Anniversary and I wanted to keep the tradition going.  Although we do have a Cheesecake factory in Hawaii, which I need the energy, to get to Waikiki and with the very long wait, I don't really visit this location back home often.  This is why, I really look forward to February, our Anniversary.  I Really do enjoy all my visits to this Cheesecake Factory location, located in the Forum Shops at Caesars adjacent to Caesars Palace on the Las Vegas Strip far north side of the mall. This Cheesecake Factory is HUGE with 2 levels. During my recent visit, we got our table right away after checking in with the hostess, we went after the dinner rush, which was close to 8 pm.  We always end up ordering our usual, but I still like to glance thru the famous 10 page storybook menu with 200 menu items. I like to see what new items are available. The loaded baked potato tots sounded tempting so I also got that along with our usual.  Here is what we always order, our anniversary tradition.  Fried Calamari, came with garlic dip and cocktail sauce, They make the best fried calamari, cooked just right, light and crisp.  Did you know that Cheesecake Factory has Miso Salmon?  Our entrée are the Miso Salmon X 2, fresh salmon marinated in miso, served with snow peas and white rice. I always request well done on my salmon. The miso sauce, rice, & snow peas just went so great together. We enjoyed this entrée.  Loaded baked potato tots, Crispy potato tots filled with cheese, bacon, & green onion, served with sour cream. I didn't care for this tots, I was expecting tots with the stuff separate, like nachos style. It was too rich, we didn't finish this tots.  We always get our alcoholic beverage and we need to make room for cheesecake. Never leave Cheesecake Factory with out eating a cheesecake, that's too crazy! The grand finale : cheesecake, deciding on what cheesecake to get is the hard part, with tons of flavors to choose from, My wonderful hubby always lets me choose, we are too stuffed to have our own cheesecake.  For our anniversary cake, I went with the salted caramel, enjoying every delicious bite.  Note: for any celebration, Cheesecake factory will decorate your cheesecake, free of charge. About Cheesecake Factory:  *Established in 1978 by Evelyn and Oscar Overton *The first Cheesecake Factory was founded in 1978, in Beverly Hills, California, by David Overton *There are over 150 Cheesecake Factory locations *The success of The Cheesecake Factory is a great American success story Overall, we always enjoy our visits here at this Cheesecake location and looking forward to many more!

We went out to celebrate an early Mother's Day dinner and ended up being a total waste of time. Horrible customer service for one! The host was rude and had this angry look on her face, expressing how much she hates the world and the people in front of her. We were seated quickly. Guess that was the highlight of the night. The server comes up and greeted us, ask if we would like some starters or a beverage. Took the order and came back 15 mins later, placed 2 of the 4 drinks on the table. Never gave us any straws... another strike in the books... came back 5 minutes after that to give us the other two drinks. We ordered food, ended up waiting 45+ mins for a fettuccine alfredo, 4 cheese pasta, a chicken quesadilla and a cheese burger. Keeping in mind that the restaurant wasn't even really that busy.. (Lame...) my mother in law then noticed a piece of stretch wrap melted in her pasta!!!!! The chicken in the pasta had no seasoning on it at all. My 4 cheese pasta looked as if it was sitting on the hot table baking for hours. We then called our server and brought it to her attention. She said sorry and sent the manager to our table. The manager apologized and said sorry, we wrap our chicken in plastic when breading the chicken to freeze it and that sometimes this issue happens. (Who says that?!!!) what kind of manager would explain to you that it just happens and sorry. He then asked if we wanna try anything else on the menu. We said no thank you and may we have the check please?. The server came back and said, I have something that will make you guys happy again!!! She then said I have dessert menus!!!! We said no thank you check please. She came back and said my manager took that one plate off your bill. The bill should have been discounted in total!!! None of us even finished our food after mom found that plastic!!! This location is really slackin.. I'm still replaying what the manager said to us in my head. (Yeah, sometimes it happens.) I work in the food industry and tonight was unacceptable!!!!! The GM needs to step it up. I used to LOVE Cheesecake Factory!! Now I feel that this night ruined it for me.

It was a Tuesday night around 9:30p and there was a 40 minute wait. Between exploring nearby shops and good conversation the time passed quickly. We were sat at a table near the back on the first floor and our waiter was with us right away. He took awesome care of us all evening - some of the best service I've had at a Cheesecake Factory.  We recently learned how much we love their loaded Nachos. So we ordered them with the ""spicy"" chicken to share. For dessert, we tried to new chocolate coffee cheesecake and also the Godiva brownie sundae (one of our go-tos). The new Cheesecake had great flavor, but not quite the same texture as other cheesecakes.....it felt like it stuck to my mouth in different way. Overall it was good, but next time I think we'll go back to one of our favorites (Oreo or Reese's).   There's so much good food here! I know the menu can be over-whelming. I'm not much for their pizzas and I feel their burgers are just fine.

After being in the nearby Apple Store for about 3 hours, my friend and I decided to grab dinner at Cheesecake Factory. We were seated fairly quickly, which was great, but our seat was in a super small corner and very close to the the table next to us, so we opted to sit at the bar. This is where the trouble came in.  The bartender first poured us water and took our drink order. When he placed the water down, he slammed the cups in front of us. We thought very little of it initially. Next, he delivered the drinks and walked away without saying anything about food, which we had previously told him we would be ordering. We called him back to order. My friend ordered a pasta dish and asked for extra sauce to be poured in. He replied, ""No."" We were confused and actually thought he was joking, but he said ""no you can not"" again. She asked why and he explained that many people ask for it and it comes out too soupy and he ""wasn't about to send any food back because it was too soupy."" Then he called out to someone else (another employee) and walked away. He poured a glass of red wine for another customer then He came back and pointed to me and asked what I wanted to eat, but he hadn't resolved the soupy pasta issue with my friend. We had decided that we didn't like his attitude or the way he yelled out to someone and walked away in the middle of taking our order so we decided that we would enjoy the meal at a different Cheesecake Factory. I told him that we wouldn't be eating here and that we were leaving. He took the receipt for the drinks slid it in front of us and said ""don't forget to pay for these."" We hadn't had one sip of our drinks. We asked to speak to the manager because we didn't want to walk out and have it look like we skipped out on a bill. The manager was understanding, but not apologetic, and told us that we wouldn't have pay for the drinks that we never touched.

Now to our second server who would come and bring us our food and or drink; she would slide/slam the plate or glass right onto the table without warning and would walk away without saying a thing. She did not ask us any follow up questions. She gave us attitude throughout the whole dinner up until it was dessert time which is around the time the check comes so that was when she decided she would be ""nice."" Just to top it off she packed my food and then dropped some of my food on the ground and of course did not apologize. Honestly after all that I still tipped which I regret because she didn't deserve it and I wish I spent my money elsewhere. Not everyone has a million dollars but every customer is a customer and should be treated equally with respect it's a shame the servers here know nothing about that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=60,3.44,3.53,3.64,2.8840000000000003,3.494

6,Vegas D.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,12,,5.0,2017-11-04,"First, the Service. Party of 11: Four adults and the rest under 21: Occasion:  B-day party. The wait time was to be an hour.  It was more like 35 minutes.  Polite front desk and friendly. Seating was prompt and without hassle.  Our server - Sheena.  The epitome of exceptional customer service.  Sheena is the kind of employee that employers try to keep guarded from other employers trying to poach such employees. The kind of employee every business owner desires.  An employee that instills such a great experience on patrons/customers - that it keeps them coming back.  Sheena greeted our party with professionalism, courtesy, all smiles, articulate, and just the right amount of chatter.  She came across as a seasoned server that knew the exact amount of exchange and pleasantries necessary to make everyone feel welcomed.  From taking our orders for drinks and appetizers on to the main entree and desert.  Our drinks were always topped off and our table cleared of used glasses, plates and empty bread baskets only to be replenished without delay. Not a single person had to request service.  Sheena was always one step ahead.  Thinking of pepper?  Too late, Sheena is already asking.  Shredded cheese?  Too late - Sheena is already behind you with cheese shredder just waiting for your affirmation.  Question about the food?  Yup, Sheena is there with an articulate explanation of options/make-up of the entree.  I remember trying to think of any additional request - but Sheena was there - one step ahead.  We were so lucky to have been served by this great person.  Such a delight to have as our server.   She worked our table like a ballerina - with the most exquisite detail to service. From the youngest patron, a 7 year old to my mother - everyone spoke highly of Sheena's performance.  The food, our drinks, deserts, everything was better due to Sheena's service.  The Food - Most started off with sot-drinks, while I enjoyed a Moscow Mule.  No copper mug but the Mule had a kick to it and not watered down.  For appetizers, we indulged in stuffed mushrooms, fried zucchini, calamari and artichoke?  The stuffed mushrooms were perfect and the fried zucchini was perfectly presented.  Just the right amount of crisp.  The Entrees included Chicken Madeira, Four Cheese Pasta (a favorite at the table), Steak Diane Scampi Combo, Fettucini Alfredo, Chicken Caesar Salad, Fish and Chips, Chicken Littles, and an assortment of other salads.  The Chicken Littles was quite the opposite of little.  My poor niece, who probably weighs less than 60lbs got full by just looking at the mountain of food on her plate.  It was an inordinate amount - much more than the typical Cheesecake Factory portion.  The food was very good.  Of course, we enjoyed our meal more due to the great service provided by Sheena.  For appetizers the selection was diverse - Snickers Cheesecake, Oreo Dream Cheesecake, 30th Anniversary Cheesecake (this is the one item I had second thoughts on - I should have ordered the Oreo Dream Cheesecake - the 30th Anniversary didn't have the sugar kick that accompanied the Oreo Cheesecake), Salted Caramel - probably one of the best choices for deserts, and the Birthday Sunday for the Birthday girl.  Served with black coffee to conclude this exceptional experience.  Thank you Cheesecake Factory and above it all - Sheena - just wow!  Thank you so much!  Entire family appreciate and thank you for the exceptional service.  Truly a unique experience.  That 30% tip should have been at least 50%.  Well deserved. Thank you again.  The Arroyo family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=20,3.36,3.52,3.64,,3.4560000000000004

24,Michael C.,"Honolulu, HI",378,724,4176.0,4.0,2017-11-24,"SWEET! With all the calories that could be potentially consumed at any TCF location, dining at TCF is a bonafide treat (for me, personally).  My mom and I both love cheesecake, and therefore we couldn't pass up the chance of dining at this location. LOCATION / SETTING: The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace near the aquarium.  Restaurant is 2 floors, with some seating on the first floor having views of the aquarium and Atlantis Show.   side NOTE:   We actually visited this location twice during our vacation last month.  The first time for take out cheesecake from their counter, and the 2nd for lunch on our last day. FOOD: The menu is enormous!  So much choices/selections....and that's just the dessert section.  The menu has appetizers, salads, sandwiches, entrees, pastas, etc.  Even for the most finicky of eaters, I'm sure there must be something on this menu that is appealing. After some time, we decided on the egg roll sampler, while my mom chose the Shepard's Pie, my brother selected the super oxidant salad, and I ordered the BBQ chicken salad (lunch portion).  For drinks, my mom and I ordered coffee, and my brother was all smiles when the server confirmed they could make him a Bloody Mary. The egg rolls were ok.  They were a bit more oily than I expected, but I shouldn't have been surprised since we ordered fried food for an appetizer.  Not sure if I would order this again.  Thereafter, our entrees were delivered to the table, and I am so happy there were lunch sizes available because my salad seemed (to me) as if it were a FULL SIZE order.  It was massive!  It was just enough for myself, but unfortunately I couldn't bring myself to finish it.  If I were to order this again on a future visit, I would probably ask for no fried onions/onion rings (it just seemed a bit excessive to me).  My brother enjoyed his salad and finished the entire serving.  My mom, on the other hand, found her choice to just be mediocre.  In hindsight, she admitted she should have chosen something else such as a salad or sandwich.   Lastly, the cheesecake (like always) was very satisfying.  We ordered (at the take out counter) one slice each of the key lime and pumpkin seasonal cheesecake.  I felt we needed to order the pumpkin since its a seasonal flavor, and we both concurred that both slices weren't overly sweet. SERVICE: Very exceptional.  The hostess was friendly and seated us immediately (we arrived at around 1045 am on a Saturday; the restaurant opened at 10am that day).  Our server was a friendly and knowledgeable woman, who answered all our menu questions, and periodically checked on us throughout our meal.   One last thing to mention:  the staff at the take out counter were polite and very efficient.   BOTTOM LINE: Convenient (take a break while shopping!) and spacious location.  Great service.  Delicious desserts!  Yay Cheesecake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3,3.28,3.48,3.596,,3.4000000000000004

23,Alan B.,"La Jolla Shores, San Diego, CA",264,814,3204.0,4.0,2017-12-26,I have been a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory since day one. This was my first visiting this location of The Cheesecake Factory.  I got lucky enough to get a table as The Cheesecake Factory does get busy real fast.  As I already knew what I wanted to order. For the appetizer I had the Chicken Quesadilla that was excellent. For the main dish I had the BBQ Chicken Salad that was also excellent.  What I like about The Cheesecake Factory over the larger restaurant chains the food is always solid. The food portions are always large to share with others. Leave room for desserts. As the cheesecakes are a must. No matter what you are craving when it comes to cheesecakes you will not go wrong. I recommend the mango or raspberry cheesecake.  The customer service was excellent from the minute you arrive to the minute you leave. This Cheesecake Factory location in the back of the forum shops. You have private lot parking and valet.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3,3.56,3.56,3.612,,3.5600000000000005

Dined in on the 21st of December for my baby sisters birthday outing and this location had the perfect vibe, music and staff. Our server Jeff was a delight so definitely ask for him when you're there! Their Avocado Egg Rolls served with a Tamarind-Cashew dipping sauce is to die for! If you haven't had it yet and want a savoury appetiser, it's the best choice. My Egg Rolls were fresh, crunchy and the sauce is delicious; If they bottled it and sell it, I'd definitely buy.  For my entrée, I had the yummy Evelyn's Favourite Pasta; rigatoni tossed with so many veggies and topped with a pesto.  I also got the Vegan Cobb Salad, which by the way is HUGE, so I definitely recommend sharing it!  Last but not least, my favourite part... the Cheesecake. You can't go to Cheesecake Factory and not get Cheesecake, that's just wrong.

Our order was taken quickly. She asked if we wanted bread and we said no. She came back with bread and said they only had wheat. Good thing because it was almost an hour later before we got our food. I ordered a small Caesar salad with no croutons...but it came with croutons. She offered to take it back but I didn't want to wait any longer. Quicker to just pick them out. We ordered lettuce chicken tacos and edamame. We were wondering why these items took so long to be served. We ended up asking for our cheesecakes to go to save time. Nothing wrong with our food but was kind of full because of munching on bread while waiting a long time.

The fish tanks out front is very appealing. My daughter enjoyed walking around looking at the fishes.Cheesecake Factory's location within Caesars Palace is a prime locations because there is just so much to see. Caesars Palace had a greek god show (not sure if they have it all the time) but the show was cool. We got to watch it as we ate.   The service wasn't that great because they were super busy. The food took awhile to come out. When it did come out, some of it was cold. I guess they wanted to wait for everything to be ready before they brought it out. But it was just too busy for us to ask them to heat up our food, considering we waited an hour to order and about 40 mins for our food to come out. Needless to say we still enjoyed our food. We are big Cheesecake Factory lovers. And the greek gods show definitely helped to keep us entertained.  I would recommend Cheesecake Factory.
