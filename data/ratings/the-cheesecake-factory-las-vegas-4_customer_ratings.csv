435,Ed J.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,10,,4.0,2012-01-11,"We have been here about 8 times. It is a really big restaurant so it is unlikely that you will have a quiet and intimate meal. However, the food is always better than average and it is a great place to bring groups of 4 or more people. Also, the variety is unsurpassed unless you venture to a casino restaurant.  We will continue to come here and it is definitely unique in the west to northwest part of town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4?start=460,3.68,3.68,3.68,2.9280000000000004,3.6800000000000006

504,Diane S.,"Port Orchard, WA",101,94,403.0,2.0,2012-02-05,"Visit was on 1/11/12- I expect more from the Cheesecake Factory, especially for the price.  This use to be one of my fave places to eat but no more.  It was 10 minutes before we got water, another 10 before our order for apps was taken.  We ordered the crispy taquitos to start with.  Tasty but the guacamole was so skimpy-not enough for 2 people to have a decent dab.  The hubby ordered the Ribbed Eye (at CF? Really???). It was overcooked but service was so spotty that night that we were afraid to send it back.  it came with fries...The fries are different and not for the better.  I ordered the stuffed chicken tortilla.  It was still as good as I remembered.  CF still has the best Ranch dressing.  We ordered cheesecake to go.  My husband got the Coconut cream which he said was ""fine"".  I tried the Pineapple upside down cake.  It was just okay but that isn't a quality issue-just a matter of taste. Like most of the chains restaurants, it is easy to see that they have skimped here & there to make their profit.  I would rather they be honest-either keep the quality with smaller proportions or charge more.   Can't give them an A-ok because for the price it was a huge disappointment and it seems the last few times we have gone, our experience gets just a little bit worse...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4?start=500,3.64,3.64,3.64,2.6960000000000006,3.6400000000000006

I usually go to the one in GV and compared to this one, GV has way better service.

421,Carisa M.,"Las Vegas, NV",81,10,,3.0,2012-03-06,"I took my friend for a birthday lunch and it was all okay. I had a glass of wine and he had ""the Ritz"" martini which was actually quite delicious. Appetizers were okay but when it came to my Pear and Endive salad, I have to say it was less than mediocre. I maybe ate 1/3 of it because that's all the endive/fresh greens that were in it. The rest was iceberg and I don't find that appetizing. Especially when I expect endive in a pear and endive salad.

520,S. P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,20,,2.0,2012-03-16,"A couple years ago, this place was good. I always loved coming here for the ambiance, and the food was always pretty awesome. Within the past year, though, I've had complaints, but still gave them chances to redeem themselves. But now, I don't think I'll be back for a while.  During one visit, we had a group of six people. I don't know what was going on with our waiter, but he came to check on us maybe once after we got our food, and none of our drinks were ever filled. When it came time to drop off the bill, we were informed that gratuity was already added to the bill. In my experience, places only do this if your party is eight or larger. The only reason this pissed us off was because it then clicked in our heads, ""Oh, so that's why he didn't give a fuck about serving us. He's getting a fat tip anyway."" And it's not like he was nowhere to be found. We saw him several times, checking on people around us, but could never get his attention. I only wish I could remember his name. But what iced the cake was our last visit. My boyfriend ordered a burger, medium rare. When it came out, it looked good until he took a bite of it. The entire inside was raw. It was so disgusting, I couldn't even believe it. Our waitress seemed to agree, and she took it back for them to make a new one. Then a manager came and sort of apologized, asked if we wanted anything else. We're all modest and junk so we said, ""No, we're fine,"" but of course we were expecting they at least wouldn't charge us for the burger or, ya know, give us a coupon or something. Nothing. Guess they don't seem to care if the customer gets food poisoning because of their careless chefs. Not trying to sound like a freeloader, I just think it was a horrible business call. Anyways, it was enough for me to want to stay away for a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4?start=520,3.56,3.56,3.56,2.9200000000000004,3.5600000000000005
418,Krystle T.,"Mangilao, Guam",84,49,24.0,1.0,2012-03-20,"The food was pretty good... for a chain.  It was exactly what we expect from the Cheesecake Factory.... consistent with all the other Cheesecake Factories I had been to. Don't get me wrong... my family and I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory. It's a guilty pleasure....  The things that irked me about this particular location: 1.  Parking: what a pain! luckily they had valet (which we used...awesome!) however we had a large party and one family had a baby and i KNOW they parked uber far and had to carry the infant seat and everything.... 2.  Service: what a nightmare.  I don't even know our server's name.  All I remember is she was blond, and short (not in stature, but attitude-wise).  Granted we had a large party (13 people) ... uh oh... here's where i go off on a rant. So we had a large party.  It was my (pregnant) sister-in-law's birthday. We had 3 children with us 10 adults... we all arrived within 10 minutes.  We had asked the server to wait until we were all here to start taking orders.... but she didn't feel that was a good idea.  I personally felt that we got the short end of the stick because we were a large party and she felt she did not have to give us good service because she was already getting auto-gratted.  Boo on her.  Tip karma forces my boyfriend (who picked up the tab that night) to automatically tip AT LEAST 25 percent (instead of the, what, 18 percent auto gratuity on parties of 6 or more?) anywho, drinks came out staggered. menus came out staggered.  food came out staggered.... all because the server did not want to wait the few minutes for all of us to be seated and get situated.  rawr. and on top of that, some rude lady in a near by booth kept shushing the 2 4-year olds with us (one being my daughter) and shooting dirty looks my way. lucky for her my parents taught me to respect my ugly... i mean elders. That all being said (please excuse my poor grammar/run-on sentences)... bottom line:  food was consistent with every other cheesecake factory out there (yay for avocado eggrolls and THE BEST fried mac and cheese in the world) but the service was shoddy (really though, WHY would you bring out dessert for everyone else and then make the 2 restless 4-year old girls wait 10 more minutes for theirs? who does that?!?)  I'll stick to the location in Henderson, or even brave the strip and head to the Cheesecake Factory in Caesar's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4?start=420,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.8520000000000003,3.4800000000000004

323,Kristina O.,"Cypress, CA",98,349,45.0,5.0,2012-04-20,"Not only is this my favorite chain restaurant, it's also my favorite restaurant. The variety is so immense. You could have your pick from so many different cuisines from American, to Italian, to Chinese, and so on. There is always something for everyone, and they have insanely huge portions. This makes it so you always have some left over for later that day and the next day.  It's always important to save room for the cheesecake though. My personal favorite is their Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake. It doesn't get much more satisfying than that. I know this is a really short review, but the food is excellent, the service is top notch, and the ambiance is fantastic. The only thing that would negatively affect my review is the wait to get a table.

The waiter was very tolerant of the fact that we sat and talked long after our meal was over.  Granted we came in at 1 P.M. and they weren't that busy but if I was a waiter I would have been thinking ""jeez people, are you moving in?""  I thought we would never get the bill and then discovered my son-in-law had paid during his trip to the rest room.  He's a good boy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4?start=400,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.088,3.5600000000000005

This location is located in the Boca Park shopping center. For customers they offer free valet parking. If you don't feel like valet, they have a private lot for parking or there is a parking garage. I love to start with the ""Avocado Eggrolls"" and if you have never tried them you must! They were priced at $10.50 and can easily be shared.  My favorite thing to order for my meal is the ""Carlton Salad"". It is huge but I manage to polish off every last bite because the awesome flavor keeps my fork going back for more. The salad was priced at $13.95 which is fair for the size and amount of fresh fruits & veggies in it. The only problem is I never have room for one of their many choices of fabulous cheesecake for dessert so I pick one to-go. This last visit it was a hard choice but they are all so good I new I couldn't go wrong with the ""Reese's Peanut Butter Cheesecake"".  If you don't feel like eating inside or outside on the patio, you can phone in your order for pick up.

This place is all things to all people but they are far different than these other establishments that try to please everyone. The other places lack in quality because they are trying too hard to offer too many mediocre dishes. This place has both quantity of menu items to choose from and they are prepared with quality as well. Although your Vietnamese spring rolls or your sweet corm tamales aren't the most authentic you've ever had, they are pretty darn tasty. And I don't know about y'all but I'll take tasty over authenticity anytime. That's why I'm the only Asian you'll see at PF Chang's. Haha. Today I was there for my friends bday. I just started eating clean--so to speak, so I ordered the most compliant item I could find and that was the Kobe burger. It had three ingredients. Very basic and consisting of: tomato, mushrooms, and grilled onion. I got it protein style of course. I normally would never, ever order a burger without cheese but I had to this time. For how plain it was I was so pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It was Sofa King good! So flavorful with juices dripping out from the wrapper. I was not embarrassed to be heard slurping that stuff up. Not gonna waste any of that tasty burger grease. But please people, don't order a Kobe burger if it's gonna be hotter than med-rare. That's just a waste of good meat. If you're scared of a little pink in the middle, stick to your fast food burger joints.  And of course...who doesn't order a cheesecake when they're at CCF? Me. Whomp, whomp. I had to stick with the bowl of strawberries.

It's mother/daughter date night and Hunnie Bunnie has picked this place again after having the Bow Tie Pasta in Marinara sauce last time. They should really take reservations because this place ALWAYS has a wait AND the waiting area gets CROWDED.  The wait is 25-30 minutes. 28 minutes later our pager goes off - It's go time!  Tonight Im starting with a glass of Prosecco. It's not as sweet as I would like so totally not ordering THIS again... I told our server I didn't like it and she was just kind of like Ooohkay...  We start with a bowl of New England Clam Chowder and their complimentary table bread served with little pats of cold butter. It would be better if the butter was actually spreadable but whatevez. The soup is in an ENORMOUS bowl and pretty tasty. We ate about half and had the rest packed up. Chicken Chipotle Pasta for me it is! SO delish!! Perfect amount of spiciness that doesnt take away from the flavor of the dish - I love all the veggies mixed in with the pasta too along with the tortilla strips. I could probably just drink the sauce and be totally satisfied. Twice in the past I have tried a different pasta only to be disappointed so I'm just gonna stick with this WINNER!  Hunnie Bunnie is getting her Bow Tie Pasta in Marina Sauce (meatless) and she obviously loves it - she says it is her FAVORITE! So about mid-meal a very nice manager comes over and asks me about the Prosecco. I just told him it wasnt sweet enough to my liking and he took it away and OFF my bill :) The Cheesecake is DELICIOUS of course as well! Rich and creamy and NOMTASTIC!

I have no idea what the kitchen did, that half of them were sticking together in a big clump and they seamed not cleaned the right way, too. Our server was more concerned how much tips she made from the big party that was right across from us, then taking a little more care on the other guest. My dink was empty for a while and it was sure not that busy, cause the big party already left. By the way, if you iron your shirt and pants, you might look a little more professional, then looking crumbled up from head to toe. It's not really nice to look at, remember your in a service job!

Every online posted experience, the food always met or exceeded their expectations. The food is always hot and fresh with great flavors. Here is a quote from   about the Cheesecake factory: ""You want selection? There are two pages of just appetizers. TWO pages! Just check out all the mouthwatering selections online if you have a moment. I haven't even tried a tenth of their menu, and yet it remains one of my favorite places to eat. Go for the cheesecake, stay for the food, never a disappointment!"" This fabulous restaurant has incredible customer service. The staff will greet you right away. They will cater to your special occasions. As an example if you have a birthday or anniversary, they will surprise you with a free desert at the end of the meal. They will even gather the staff and sing happy birthday energetically to the birthday person. If it is an anniversary they will personalize the desert by writing happy anniversary. They will make alterations to the menu items to meet your needs and do it with a smile. Their great attitudes have made many post reviews online with many reputable sites. Some of them include   and Yelp. There are incredible reviews written on Yelp for all over the US, proving the consistency of great service. Depending on the mood you are in they have a dine-in and a take-out option. For the take-out option, they also provide curbside pickup. One of the Yelp the reviews said ""Our waiter and he was absolutely amazing. Definitely one of the best waiters I have ever had before. Not only was he very good at what he does (taking orders, getting drinks, making sure that everyone is taken care of at the table) he was also very personable.

Everyone at my table loved him, and said the same thing... that he is on of the best waiters we have ever had"" at a restaurant.""

Yes, I said lower on calories and The Cheesecake Factory has a special menu for this.  Drumroll...their SkinnyLicious menu. In the last 4 months, I've been to a Cheesecake Factory about 5 times.  Every single time, my meal of choice comes from their healthier options.  This menu has a range from chicken breast, steak, tacos, some fish, and turkey.  Of course, there's a bunch of salad options, but I don't do salads. I tried their White Chicken Chili with Brown Rice.  I was surprised that my meal was less than 500 calories.  It was damn good.  It's basically a lighter chili sauce, some brown rice mixed in, and a whole lot of chicken breast pieces.  Loved it! As for the service, it didn't start off too well.  It was a Friday night and we got seated right away.  But it took forever for our server to come and take our order. I had to give the eye to one of the employees walking by just to get service.  Within 5 minutes, service is what we got.  By the way, service was great from then on.

I used some of the bread that was brought to the table to soak up the last bit of the wine sauce.  For dinner I had a Macaroni & Cheese Burger. This was a risky choice...I knew I would either love it or hate it. The burger had fried macaroni balls and cheese sauce on it. I asked them to leave the veggies off my burger this time because I did not know if fried mac & cheese and tomatoes, onion or lettuce go good together or not. The burger was very cheesy and I enjoyed it. The fries it came with were hot and good. The side of ranch I requested was nasty though. It does not even taste like ranch but something bitter and gross and the color was more clear than white. My wife had half of a chicken salad sandwich and cup of tortilla soup.

267,Michael F.,"North Las Vegas, NV",16,88,101.0,4.0,2013-12-16,Cheesecake!!!!! But they are not just doing desserts. They have a full menu. First time I ate here was couple weeks ago since my boss(thanks boss) gave me a gift card. I have had their cheesecake from friends who picked up dessert for birthdays and such. It's perfect for families and for those date nights. It can be noisy but when me and my girlfriend arrived the waitress sat us in the corner and we felt all alone.  My girlfriend went with some basic chicken fingers but I did the Shepard's pie and boy was it sooo good. It was full of flavor and perfect for a cold day. The serving was soooo big which is not a bad thing. I ate all of it and when it came to dessert time the slice of cheesecake was huge!! I got the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake and it was a perfect for a sweet tooth! My girlfriend couldn't finish hers but I ate all of mine ha ha. Edit: I can't believe I forgot that we started with mini crab cakes. They were good and this is from someone who doesn't eat much crab except for sushi. The food and service was good. The prices were not bad for the amount of food you get. Definitely returning!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4?start=240,3.6,3.53,3.53,3.248,3.5580000000000003
326,Spencer H.,"Los Angeles, CA",816,25,94.0,3.0,2013-12-20,"Cheesecake factory, one of my favorite spots and very popular among my friends.  This time around was last thursday 12/12/13 and our server was Shawn M. dinner time we had a good size group about 12 people total. They sat us with 8 because the rest of our group would take some time. Starting with the food. I am an impulse kind of guy, i like to try new things but don't like deciding. This time i actually saw a picture of the dish i got on a screen above the bakery counter. I got the steak Diane. med rare super tender and flavorfull. with potatoes. I also tried some of the caesar salad. Both amazing and up to par for cheesecake factory. We got sat and we were starving. our waiter came over explained the specials as they usually do. We were very thirsty and asked for water. He claimed he was not taking drinks right now he will just explain the specials and come back in a few minutes. Something im not really used to hearing as we all just wanted water. I am myself a server so i tried to be understanding. When he did come back a few minutes later. we gave our drink orders mostly water. My girl said we ready to order too when you are. He explained ""ok well im just gonna take the drinks now until the rest of your group gets here give me a minute"". The tone was very unfriendly to me and my entire group. It was obvious he knew we were a gratuity table and since we were young did not care to go above and beyond to get the little extra that cheesecake servers usually give. At this point i started to pay attention to him. Noticing which tables he was responsible for, how many were seated etc etc. this just justified the fact that yes we were a gratuity table of kids to him and so he did not care as much as he did his other tables. When he came back i decided to speak up as the rest of my group were kinda annoyed. I explained clear we are ready to order when you are, the rest of our group will not be here for awhile. This is after about 15 minutes of us being seated already. an estimate of about 35 minutes until we finally started receiving our food. Not ideal but nothing we could do at this point. My water specifically was refilled only twice, i drink a lot of water, and less than half way through my meal i was done. and didn't get a refill until i was done with my meal. Then once more AFTER i received my split check at which point i no longer needed a refill. Order taken food arriving and the rest of our group showed up.  this part annoyed me the most, he explained to our friends that just arrived ""yeah they didn't wait for you guys so let me know when your ready to order"". Little does this server know we explained that to them already and they are the ones who told us to order because they would not be there for awhile. This is something i am not used to at cheesecake factory. This particular server definitely did not start us off right. i am sure that the rest of my group might not understand why. But as a management myself i know when a server notices a young gratuity table and does not care to meet minimum standards of service. We were his only large table and from what i could see he was not so overwhelmed that he could not care to give us the service he was giving others. Where as his smaller tables got lots of time and attention. Night ended and he put us all on one check. Someone asked to have it split and he did so. Thing was he knew pretty much exactly what everyone had. The time it took for him to bring us the split checks, and cash us out was definitely inattentive. We were actually trying to meet our next destination at a certain time but ended up not going because we were waiting for him to cash out our checks. We got the first check at 22:13 and my check personally was not checked out till about 22:33 per my receipts.  with this series of bad events and lack of care for a young gratuity table. that is why 3 stars. My only advice is if you have a large group try your best not to have this server.  automatic gratuity is necessary but should never be an excuse for poor service at a restaurant known for service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4?start=320,3.52,3.53,3.53,3.1160000000000005,3.5260000000000002

476,M-Jeanne De M.,"Las Vegas, NV",52,136,145.0,1.0,2013-12-30,"WARNING: CHEESECAKE FACTORY DOES NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS, SO PREPARE TO WAIT AT THEIR MERCY. On a late December 2013 night at Boca Park Cheesecake Factory, we were welcomed by shrieking toddlers (the kind of piercing, high-decibel sound that raises blood-pressure among the most minimally sentient humans) and boys big enough to know better who were treating the waiting area like a playground and endangering anyone who enters the place. There ought to have been some professional supervision to protect the other customers from those rowdy rascals. Our dinner companions chose to wait the forty minutes for a table--but outside, so that we could avoid the wanton pandemonium inside the restaurant. We had one good experience at this location a few months ago, thus figured that it was worth the wait. IT WAS NOT. Our waiter was pleasant enough, but we had to constantly ask him for water-refills and he did not offer freshly-ground pepper to me for the infinitesimally small sirloin steak ""culotte"", though he did so for my sister's Caesar salad. Spotty at best was the waiter's service, and after we finished our entrees, the fellow waited a full hour before presenting us with the dessert menu. The bread basket held something white, and I inquired whether or not it was sourdough, with which I have been familiar  all my life. The waiter said ""yes"". Upon tasting it, one could not detect a single sour note, and this eatery-chain is based in California, where sourdough bread is ubiquitous! I was disgusted by the formerly frozen, inadequately cooked ""French fries"" that came with my pee-wee steak, and its two substandard onion rings. There was a paper cup on the plate that contained ketchup, of all things. Had the waiter returned, I would have asked for a suitable condiment (give the dish a French name, and you had better include Dijon mustard, not the risible, flavor-masking ketchup). The fries were ""immangeable"", to use a derogatory French word that means ""inedible"". And at around twenty-five bucks, a microscopic, pathetically thin steak is an insult to anyone with a sense of proportion. There was one high note on the table: an appetizer called Buffalo Blasters. Without them, I may have gone hungry--oh, the irony in a place with one of the longest menus in creation. My husband had the usually fail-safe dish, fettuccine Alfredo. He perceived that the noodles were old or reheated. I noticed that the ""sauce"" was too thin to adhere to the pasta, and that the dish had been inappropriately infused with raw garlic, a vile act which constitutes sabotage. We detest the stinking tuber, and would never order such a thing knowingly.  It's a crime to call a dish ""Fettuccine Alfredo"", which NEVER had garlic in it, and turn the unsuspecting customer into this week's Garlic Clown, who has people running helter-skelter from his reeking person. An honest name for the concoction would be, ""Noodles in Raw Garlic Soup with a Hint of Cheese"". You cannot bastardize a recipe this way! Poor Chef Alfredo of Rome--his recipe has become a clown show in a bowl. A slice of chocolate mousse layer-cake was dry, heavy and seemed days-old. My cappuccino was lukewarm upon arrival. The only positive thing about the evening at Cheesecake Factory of Boca Park was the company at our table. I submit mostly five-star reviews here at Yelp; because I don't like to shoot at ambulances, I refrain from offering negative reports. However, when a huge chain restaurant serves factory-food at boutique prices, I am duty-bound to say so. And when one looks longingly at a Jack in the Box sign on the drive home after dinner, something is very wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4?start=400,3.4,3.48,3.48,3.0760000000000005,3.4480000000000004

I was trying to be ""healthy"" so ordered the Santa Fe Salad.  What was I thinking?  McDonald's makes a really good Santa Fe salad with breaded chicken (probably totally not healthy).  I actually kinda love it, though I don't go to McDs often. I was hoping TCF, with their reputation, would have a version just as good. But no, it was just what I imagine a ""healthy"" salad being.  Lackluster in flavor with not much to recommend it other than the fact that it was relatively healthy. My sis had the apple pork chops.  She really liked it, though I personally am not a fan of sweet savory.  The mashed potatoes were excellent, which I remember from my visit 15 years ago. My brother-in-law had the Davinci pasta dish, which is one of the 2 dishes they said they almost always order (the other being the shrimp scampi).  I only had a taste but my god, that was good!  It really didn't look like much because the sauce seemed fairly light, but the flavor was amazing.  Cheesecake tiramisu. Drool.  I like cheesecake and I like tiramisu but I don't generally love either.  I LOVED the cheesecake tiramisu.  Fluffy and light, all 3 of us agreed this was utterly delicious.

Then we had one person order dessert, when the dessert came rhe waiter came back and asked if we wanted anymore dessert. We said no again and waited another 10 minutes for him to bring the check. This is not only horrible for a guest whose dinner normally would take no longer than an hour but for the business as their turn over time is much higher allowing less opportunity for guests to come in.

There are too many eateries in the area to take any chances at this location. The Cheesecake Factory on the westside has a reputation for a 50-50 split between enjoying the meal or feeling sick. During our last visit, sick meant food poisoning. After eating the lightest meal at this location -- fish and chips -- the next week resulted in one of the worst bouts of food poisoning ever. I should have known. The fish tasted frozen and as if it had been left under the heat lamp too long. It should have went back, but after a long road trip, no on had the energy to wait around.  Afterward, the incident was reported. The company claimed to do an investigation, said they could find no evidence that could trace the sickness back to the restaurant, and promptly sent the absolute last thing anyone in my family wanted to see -- a gift certificate to go back.

286,Thomas S.,"Las Vegas, NV",290,70,1128.0,3.0,2014-06-29,"TLDR: expansive menu + kids', long waits, standard service, inside/outside seating This California-based company prides itself on continuing Oscar's and Evelyn's dream of providing excellent cheesecakes and desserts in a bakery setting. I'm not so sure that this is reflected in today's restaurants, started by their son, David.  My family decided that we would venture into the not-so-upscale Fashion Village at Boca Park. Because Cheesecake Factory boasts an expansive menu, even for the kiddos, I guess I wouldn't mind holding our spot in line for our large party. A promised 45-minute wait, although expected at peak dining hours on a Saturday night, was cut down to about 25 minutes: an unexpected, but welcome, plus! The host stand seemed filled with unnerving hostesses as well as the hustle and bustle of seating all the walk-up guests. They probably needed a break and a reminder that every new customer deserves a positive experience.  Upon seating, I was immediately greeted my by waitress. Her smile appeared genuine and her customer service rhetoric was unwavering excellent. I was impressed. A secondary server/busser provided bread and waters for all the guests without question. It was fantastic. Our waitress was very accommodating, making suggestions, attentively listening to our requests/restrictions, and tending to the needs of the young children at the table. Upon everyone's food delivery, a manager approached my table to discuss the reason as to why my salmon salad wasn't delivered yet. He stated a vague, yet wordsmithed response in which he basically stalled for an additional 7 minutes. The ""fish just wasn't right"" probably meant that it wasn't cooked yet, it fell on the floor, they forgot, or any combination of two. A specific, yet honest answer would have been more appreciated. Isn't honesty the best policy? Although the selected dishes varied, I will comment on what I tasted during my experience. My salmon salad for $17.95 was delicious. An herb-crusted salmon topped field greens, cut tomatoes, endive, and asparagus paired nicely with my glass of iced green tea (suggest simple syrup from the bar to accompany the drink). The salmon looked at least 8oz and did not overpower the dish. I recommend the ranch in lieu of the vinaigrette. The children's pepperoni pizza can be a little spicy for children, so be wary of your picky eaters. The tostada salad is a mouth-watering heaping mound of greens atop chicken and a tostada. The lettuce wasn't dried/spun prior to plating and, therefore, left an unnecessary pool of water on the plate and tostada (which transformed into a soft taco shell). The meatloaf is average: nothing special and nothing exciting. Save yourself and select an alternative dish. For dessert, the limoncello cream torte was to die for. Layers of vanilla cake christened with lemon marscopone allows for a sweet dish worthy in lieu of any dessert wine.  As we received the check, our desserts were double charged, a strike two for our experience. With the tardiness in food delivery, accuracy of order, and initial experience, I rate it 3/3.5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4?start=280,3.68,3.58,3.58,3.404,3.6200000000000006

My wife and I walked in at about 3:30PM and it was almost entirely empty. My wife is currently walking with a cane as she is recovering from knee replacement surgery. The hostess greeted us and promptly told us it would be about a five minute wait - please have a seat. WHAT??? five minute wait in an empty restaurant??? Did she see the cane? Does she know that 95% of the tables are wide open? I am not exaggerating, it was 95% EMPTY!!!!  OK, let it go... she was stupid. We were seated in about three minutes - just long enough for my wife to uncomfortably sit down and stand back up again.  Food took a LONG time to come out - especially considering how busy the kitchen was (sarcasm). I ordered the herb crusted salmon salad from their new ""skinnylicious"" menu. My wife had the Steak Diane/Chicken Madiera combo. Hers was what you'd expect - typical Cheesecake Factory OK meal. Mine on the other hand was UNDERWHELMING. Our server informed me that the salmon on this salad usually comes cold, unless I would like it heated. I opted for warmed. Big mistake. Their idea of warmed seemed to be microwaved to the point of shriveled and hard around the edges. Also their idea of salad seemed to be dump some greens out of a bag o' salad and dress it up with a couple of sticks of asparagus. Come on guys... make me a fresh piece of fish and use some higher quality greens. Like I said, UNDERWHELMING! I really expect that in a restaurant, they should be able to prepare/cook a piece of fish better than I can at home. I also expect freshly cooked, not what had to be cooked yesterday (or last week) before it went bad and then refrigerated to hold it for leftovers for the salad.

We've celebrated birthdays and anniversaries and it's always at the top of our list whenever we plan on celebrating a special occasion. The service is always phenomenal. The wonderful, helpful and friendly staff are genuine and are always there to greet you and make sure your experience is memorable. It's a fact that The Cheesecake Factory invests an average of $3,000 per employee on training - and it most definitely shows!  In addition, the food is always fresh and fast and the hearty-sized portions will leave you satisfied with some leftovers to take to work the following day! Over time we've  tried dozens of the items on their menu and we've never been disappointed. We look forward to the warm bread and butter that they serve you as soon as you're seated (TIP: Ask for a side of shredded Parmesan cheese with the bread and dip the buttered slices into the cheese! WOW!). It is very uncommon, but there were instances where mistakes in the order did occur, such as forgetting to remove the chicken when asked, or having a dish served cold. But when brought to their attention, they will always be extra sincere and apologetic and will always reimburse you to your satisfaction, so I won't take points off for that!

So far so good, right? My food comes out (burger undercooked with onions on it and I said NO onions). I flag down the server, she takes it away. 15 min later, still no burger so I ask where is my food? Server tells me the kitchen ran out of burger patties and they are making more. Huh? Ok, whatever. 25 min goes by and I ask for a manager. Still no food. Manager (Robert) strolls over and says I will take burger iff the bill. And asks if there is anything else he can do? I said, well, I have been here for almost 1 hour and havent eaten anything. He offers me a piece of cheesecake and says ""I will go get it right away"". 10 min later, no manager, no cheesecake. We get up to leave, and the server asks if we got the cake? I said NO and the manager must have forgot. She turns and literally runs to the takeout area and gets my cake and comes back and 60 seconds. I ask for the GM of this location and she says the GM will be there on Wed. So, on Wed I will call this GM (Amy) and tell her to read this Yelp review. Its unfortunate that restaurants like Cheesecake Factory allow this to happen.

The other three stars are being subtracted for the service this location gives. Today's experience consisted of me walking in to order one slice of cake to go. It was the truffle cake. Usually the thing is pretty big. But not today, it was half the size it usually is. When I asked the worker her response was I was wrong that it's smaller than usual. She told me I Must of got the last slice the other 25 times I've bought the same cake.  She had terrible customer service. I waited for a few minutes then asked for a manager. When I told the manager it was smaller she said it did look smaller and she would get another slice. She came back and told me they measured it and it was the right size but they would give me a different slice. They came back with it and it was bigger than the first one but the same as the others I've gotten over the years.

192,Daniel S.,"Henderson, NV",990,1138,6860.0,4.0,2014-12-15,"The Cheesecake Factory is much more than cheesecake. The Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant that specializes in burgers, sandwiches, pasta, and pizza.    Yesterday after hanging out in Sabalatte in the Boca Park Fashion Village, my brother and I were up for dinner. We decided on The Cheesecake Factory. The menu offers a diverse selection of food at competitive prices inside an upscale dining room. We couldn't go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory.    Although I have only been to this location once before way back in February of 2005 when I picked up my new Saturn Ion (sure was a long time ago), and celebrated with a delicious pasta dinner, I am no stranger to the Cheesecake Factory. I have been to the Caesar's Palace location quite a few times.    When my brother and I stepped inside the dimly lit and elegant restaurant, it was understandably busy. The friendly hostess took our name and kindly let us know that there would be a five minute wait. The Cheesecake Factory has yet to implement the text messaging system that some restaurants have incorporated. The wait was less than five minutes.    Tina was our waitress. She was friendly, never rushed us, and constantly checked up on us. I am giving a shout out for Tina on account of the fact that my brother left his sunglasses at the table. As we approached the Valley parking area (on the way to the upper deck), Tina comes running after us with his sunglasses. With that said, the service here rounded up Cheesecake Factory to four stars.    The food is also delicious. Everytime that I have dined in a Cheesecake Factory, the large portions had filled me up leaving me with no room for cheesecake. In my opinion, Cheesecake Factory is a restaurant for either dinner or coffee and dessert. We just had coffee at Sabalatte, so tonight I ordered their chicken parmesan sandwich which included fries and a Coke. The chicken parmesan sandwich is unique. I don't know of many restaurants that make it. Plus, it is delicious. Between the time of ordering and Tina delivering the sandwich, she delivered the customary dinner rolls. In past visits to the Caesar's Palace Cheesecake Factory, the pasta sauce was included.  Here, there is a separate bowl of the sauce where you pour it on to your liking. I enjoyed every bite of the chicken parmesan sandwich. It is something that I do not enjoy very often. I also enjoyed the small bowl of French fries that accompanied the sandwich. And the Coke did not have a hint of flatness. It was just as sparkling as Tina's attitude.    Cheesecake Factory was $20 well spent. The dining area is not Tiffany elegance but an elegance similar to dining in a Caesar's Palace, Venetian Hotel, or upscale resort Cafe. It is a dining environment that isolates the outside world and is simply relaxing. The food was delicious and filling. Service was outstanding. I could see another well spent $20 at Cheesecake Factory in the future. Or $30 if I am hungry and want to reward myself with their signature cheesecake and coffee.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4?start=160,3.92,3.68,3.68,3.216,3.7760000000000002

It took 15 minutes to get our bread basket and butter, but they didn't remember to give us silverware. A few minutes later, the waiter brings out silverware, after I already took it from an empty adjoining table. The waiter had the nerve to give me a long, dirty stare. You just don't do that as a server, you apologize, and move on. You never stare at your customer when they are hungry and have waited so long for bread, butter, and utensils. If we ever go back, it is just to order a piece of cheesecake from the to-go bakery.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4?start=400,3.4,3.62,3.62,2.7560000000000002,3.5320000000000005

The bread was hot, fresh and delicious. They gave us a good amount of time to place our order and our food came quick. The appetizer we ordered was spinach artichoke dish which was delicious and plenty. We were pretty much stuffed from the dip plate and the bread. My son had the kids mac n cheese and says the cheesiness was just right, he liked that it was not yellow. He also like that he got several refills on his sprite and if this review was up to just him he would give it a 5 star rating.  My daughter had the kids spaghetti and one meatball. She claims the meatball crust was too hard and the noodles were too thick but the sauce was good and the meatball was flavorful. She also would rather have another meatball and less noodles. Daddy had the steak Dianne. He ordered it medium well but it came out medium rare but was ok with it because of the quality if the steak. The mashed potatoes was plentiful and really yummy. Some of the mushrooms were burnt but it did not mess up the taste. This dish had less sauce this time than it usually does but all the flavors were still there.  I had the chicken picatta. The noodles were aldente. The dish was very flavorful but very light on the stomach as well. We were anxious to get to dessert and share a raspberry type cheesecake but our stomachs got full too quick. Our waiter was quick to come back with the check and To go boxes.

Spot on shitty attitude for a hostess. I then asked her if she could check how much money was on the cards my dad gave me for Christmas and she said ""well I can't check that over here but if you wanna go over there they can check for you"" with an even shittier attitude. I then went over to the counter where they could check the credit of my gift cards and the man who checked them was cool unlike his boogie ass co worker of a host. I didn't have to wait that long to be seated which was nice. Our waiter on the other hand was acting like there was a bomb tied to her waist that would explode if she didn't do her job. I could tell in her voice that she didn't wanna be there which made it awkward for me and my family. On the other hand the food was really good.

The large room can be conversation challenging when filled with diners. Our server was friendly and attentive.  The food ordering and preparation were timely. The Crispy Chicken Costoletta consists of 3 breaded breasts sauteed and served with a lemon sauce, mashed potatoes and fresh asparagus. The 3 large breasts were tender and juicy with a crispy panko style breading. This was 1 meal for 2 people or 2 meals. The Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp was sauteed with a spicy pepper sauce.  The entree is served with a choice of white or brown rice, along with black beans, plantains, and a cool mango sauce. The plantains were crispy outside and soft on the inside. The generous portion of shrimps were moderately spicy but not overwhelming. The cool mango was a nice contrast to the spicy shrimp.

For the Boca Park location, it's not a good look and definitely not expected. The rude bartender (a somewhat aged blonde female who wears her hair pulled back in a ponytail) was absolutely a HORRIBLE reflection of this particular location. She never ONCE asked us if everything was okay, if our food was how we ordered, if we needed anything, etc. she served the people around us, avoiding us. I had to slam the plastic ketchup container on the counter to get her attention. She stood in front of us numerous times making drinks and never once said i word. Seriously, if you don't like the job, find another one! She was the same exact way the previous time we went there and unfortunately had her. There were two guys at the end of the bar who were loudly complaining about something as well. I voiced my complaint to the manager, but somehow I wasn't convinced this issue will be addressed. A lot of these servers have the mentality of who they ""think"" will and will not tip. Well I have news for the ones who think that way: YOU'RE the one messing up YOUR money, not the client. I definitely laugh at the ones who THINK they deserve a tip no matter how they performed. Well I definitely have a tip for them: don't walk in dark alleyways at night.  If you can, steer clear of this particular bartender.

That said, I want to say it didn't have an impact on the food or the service.  Antonio was our server and he was excellent.  We started out with an appetizer of lettuce wraps, these with chicken and quite tasty.  The main course followed soon, my wife ordered a Mushroom Burger, mmmm delicious.  My daughter ordered the 4 Cheese Pasta and she loved it.  And finally I ordered a Macaroni and Cheese Burger, enticed by the idea of macaroni and cheese on a hamburger.  The macaroni was a ball, breaded and deep fried on top of the hamburger which was charbroiled and served with all the extras including fries.  What a surprise, this was a very good combination, especially if you like macaroni and cheese anyway. The restaurant was very busy but that didn't affect service.  Antonio took great care of us and our drinks never got empty.  The downside here is that they do not have Raspberry Iced Tea, my favorite, but only had regular and a couple of bottled teas.  I settled for regular tea but didn't enjoy it or finish it.

185,Michelle O.,"Las Vegas, NV",103,156,289.0,3.0,2015-03-15,"One of the reasons why I love eating at Cheesecake Factory is because the menu has such a wide variety to choose from. It's perfect for when your with a group of people who all want different types of food or if you just don't know what you're hungry for. Everything on their menu is absolutely delicious.  This particular location is interesting because it's in Boca Park where a lot of the Summerlin snobs hang out.  Today was a beautiful sunny day so we opted to sit in the patio. Being that there was only 2 of us, and they weren't busy, we were seated right away. However I could tell, almost immediately, that this visit was going to be not a good as previous experiences. Our server, Shawn M, came over to us right away and said ""is everything okay over here?"" This was a very odd way to greet a couple who had literally just been seated. We replied yes. He asked if we were ready to order. We'd been there less than 5 min so we said no. We placed our drink orders and asked for a few more min to review the menu. This was a mistake! Almost 15 min went by before our waiter came back to take our order. We had even closed our menus hoping he'd see we were ready to order. He was attending to other tables right near us. He finally took our order. Another several min went by before someone brought bread to our table. As we ate the yummy bread and waited for our food, we caught wind of an unsatisfied couple right next to us. They seemed to be making quite a fit about some cucumbers and arugula being left off. The manager was at their table trying to smooth it over. Perhaps this is why the waiter in my area seemed off... Our food arrived finally. I ordered the mushroom burger with a salad. My bf ordered the chicken avocado club. Our food was very good. I got a side of ranch to dip my burger in and it was tasty. As we ate, the snobby couple next to us continued to be a pain. The manager ended up re-making their food to-go for them to make up for the mistake. The couple continued to sit at their table even after checking out. Awkward!! I was about half way through my food when they finally got up to leave. As they left I hear the girl say ""this is hysterical that they re-made our food!"" The Summerlin snobs left and mood quickly went from tense to peaceful.  In conclusion, my experience today was just alright. My server was inattentive and overall a bit off. The Summerlin snobs complaining only made it worse. I've been to this particular Cheesecake Factory before and have had great service. This time not so much. If you choose to eat at this location, just beware of the Summerlin snobs. I warned you. If you have an issue with your order, please tell the waiter/waitress quietly otherwise it is unnecessarily disruptive to those around you.

We waited about 15 minutes before one of the employees came over to us and told us that they could not find our order in their system. We then waited another 15 minutes for them to find the order (the order taker put it under Taylor even though I spelled my name out to her over the phone, she obviously wasn't listening). Another 15 minutes passed and we finally received the food. If you are counting that's 45 minutes waiting for a pick up order.  We got home and ate the food....

152,Tania S.,"Albuquerque, NM",218,624,1495.0,4.0,2015-04-21,"Strictly talking food, this Cheesecake Factory gets four stars. On the weekend, parking is hard to find, but it's a pretty awesome location with other new shops and family activities. The experience though, knocked it a star, otherwise it would have been one of my favorite restaurants we checked out this weekend. I ordered a Flying Gorilla beverage to start and it was pretty much my favorite part of a very, very late lunch. Still, we all were able to order from the lunch menu. I had the Avocado Rolls to start, followed by the Chinese Chicken Salad. Everything tasted great, though I'm not a huge fan of the thin, white crispy noodles. I should have asked for them to go easy on that, because there was literally a mountain of it (hence no photo).  Appetizers came out fast, but everything else was weird, honestly. My sister ordered a Piña Colada to start and then a Pepperoni Pizza. I don't think she was a huge fan of the drink, but she said the pizza was pretty much what she hoped for. Even at lunch, the portion was rather large. Leftovers, yo! Only problem is she got her food way before our friend and I. She was almost done by the time I got our food. Our friend ordered Calamari to start, which I would recommend to everyone, because their Calamari is always so good! Lightly fried, crispy bits of octopus makes for a great appetizer and big enough to share! She ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and seemed to enjoy that as well. So what happened to our bread? You know that thing they usually bring out at the very beginning at every Cheesecake Factory? Apparently they were running behind on a lot of our order, which was surprising for a weekend. Tina our server was as helpful as she could be, despite not being able to get everything out at the same time. The bread didn't even come out until we were ready for the check, so that was kind of annoying.  I would only recommend they staff the kitchen properly on a Saturday, no exceptions. Other than that, I genuinely had a nice time at Cheesecake Factory and am curious to explore more of Summerlin in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4?start=80,3.32,3.55,3.536,3.184,3.458

We were seated fairly quickly despite it being a busy weekend night and having no call-ahead for a table. They had a fancy interior, the dining room was dimly lit (just like all Cheesecake Factories), and the noise level was a little louder than average (it can get quite noisy).  As for the food, we started off with the avocado egg rolls. It may sound weird, but they're actually SO GOOD. Who would've ever thought that this unique twist on egg rolls could be so delicious? It's fried in an egg roll wrap stuffed with avocados, sun-dried tomatoes, onions, and cilantro.  A must-try for avocado aficionados (or for those who are tired of the standard guacamole)! The sauce it came with was sweet; it was the perfect pairing with the egg rolls. Let this appetizer satisfy your tastebuds with its Avocado-ey goodness! My main entree was the Louisiana chicken pasta. It had Parmesan crusted chicken (the breading was crunchy and the chicken was juicy!) over farfalle pasta with a sauce that has a bit of a spicy kick to it. This is seriously some good pasta. If you want something that's super filling, I'd go the pasta route. Presentation of the food could've been a little bit better, but the food was great nonetheless.

241,Scott E.,"Bayport, NY",122,239,120.0,2.0,2015-08-15,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been a staple in my wife and I's dining out habits. However, the last time we went to dinner we had a really disappointing experience. We brought her family that were in town from Germany so that they could finally experience this Cheesecake Factory place we tell them about somewhat frequently. To start, our waiter was the definition of a tool. I hate to be mean, but his name might as well have been Tony tough nuts. He tried to be nice, but the vibe from him just was not good. What's worse is he forgot drinks for 15 minutes at a time, and would remember when I asked about them. He took FOREVER to take our initial order, despite me asking and him walking past quite a few times. Just in general, bad vibe. Then comes the food. Service is forgivable when the food is amazing. This time, it was not. We decided to get the Guacamole since we recently had some at El Dorado and we were craving some again. They brought it to the table, and we quickly realized that it was HUGE chunks of Avocado, and not ripe avocado at that. It was hard and stringy. So I asked the waiter to send it back since, ya know, we couldn't even dip chips in it because it was like half an avocado at a time. He brings it back, and says...yeah just so you know that's how we do the guacamole now, so if you want it more mashed up you have to specify. REALLY?! It's a DIP, not pieces of apple you're eating. The thing is, with this guy, he could have been making it up since he was that type of person. he also tried to blame the bar on the drinks, then clearly went and put it in the computer since he forgot (we could see the bar and the computer right next to us). Anyway, my four cheese pasta came out luke warm and cold on the outsides, but by this point I said screw it, I ate some of it and too the rest home to heat up the next day.  Overall it was a bad experience, and I doubt we'll be back anytime soon. Gordon Biersch is always consistent for us, as is Brio, so we'll probably just go there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4?start=200,3.36,3.48,3.516,2.3440000000000003,3.4320000000000004

I asked for a manager just to inform him of the situation and he was very apologetic and made sure I got a cheesecake (comped) to-go. That was nice considering I had waiting so long for it!

216,Vanessa V.,"Las Vegas, NV",415,419,848.0,3.0,2015-08-21,"The Cheesecake Factory has something for almost everyone, which I suppose is its appeal. It's like a ""fancy"" Applebee's or Chili's, except it doesn't have junk cluttering the walls and the menu options sound appetizing.  I dined here on a Thursday evening around dinner time. Unsurprisingly, there were plenty of people ahead of us waiting to be seated, because Cheesecake Factory is just too cool to take reservations -- first come, first serve, peasants.  Once seated, we ordered the avocado egg rolls as a starter. Always a solid appetizer; though the sweet tamarind sauce might be an acquired taste for some. For my entree I ordered the grilled chicken tostada salad. When it arrived, I noticed it was missing the side of vinaigrette dressing, as well as the avocado cream and sour cream. It was unfortunate that our waitress had to make two visits to retrieve the missing items. The salad was quite huge and could easily be shared between two people. Can't say this was one of the best salads that I've ordered from here. To top off dinner, I got the kahlua cocoa chocolate cheesecake, which hit the spot and made up for the salad mishap.  Off-peak hours are always the best time to visit, if you don't mind waiting. And if you do mind, fortunately there many quality restaurants in the area that you could go to instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4?start=180,3.4,3.45,3.508,2.348,3.43
411,Tannaz M.,"Southwest, Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,1.0,2015-08-25,"I would like to start off by saying that I have paid multiple visits to cheesecake factory before. The food is diverse and made right most of the time but my visit tonight will be my last. Being a server myself, I understand that it can be complicated in the kitchen but a bad attitude from a server (whose name I don't know since she never bothered to introduce herself), is not acceptable. We started off with the portabella mushroom avocado and zucchini fries which is a staple for us and it was served different than other times but we've become accustomed to getting this dish looking different each time. We also ordered the tostada salad to share. Three iced tea refills later (one of which was the wrong kind of tea), and I had to ask the waitress where our salad was and she informed us that they burnt the tostada and were making a new one. Fifteen minutes later we get the salad which looked more like a bowl of lettuce with nothing else mixed in it. It was clearly missing some of the ingredients. The manager came around and offered to replace the salad with a new one made correctly. After three tries, we were served a simple salad that should've been on the table an hour before. I did my best to be understanding towards the server until she dropped the check off with three salads on there and she had only taken off one of them from the total. Basically they expected me to pay for THEIR mistake. At that point, I had given up on the server and once again asked to see a manager and all he did was take one more salad off and have me pay for the bill as if it was served right at a reasonable time. He never bothered to apologize or try and make up for the inconvenience. Over all it was not a good experience. People do not come to a restaurant to wait around and be treated this way. Restaurants are equally valued for their customer service as they are for their food in my eyes and cheesecake factory failed at both this time. Considering the way management acts around here, I do not think there will be a change made in this restaurant's ways. I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4?start=420,3.28,3.41,3.492,2.148,3.358

298,John V.,"Las Vegas, NV",102,109,99.0,3.0,2015-09-12,"What can you say about Cheesecake Factory that most don't already know.  Went with a group of 10 and the wait on a Friday was approx. 45 minutes. Once seated and drinks orders were taken I was quickly informed that the only beer I wanted on Tap was not working, go figure, so I didn't order any other type simply because I wanted that particular beer.  Cheesecake Factory always seems to be overwhelming to me in the menu and there is so many options and looking at the menu I soon realize I have not idea what I want. Since I have been to this restaurant before Yelping, I have tried a few items but overall never been extremely satisfied with the quality of the meals.  With that being said, this day I easily ordered The Club Sandwich, in hopes that it would be better than just standard for a sandwich, but again, its just a sandwich.  The Service was somewhat slow but nothing out the ordinary since it was Friday night and we were a big group, however, the Manager did stop by the table and apologized for the extended wait on the appetizers and said she would take care of the cost on those since they were not out after 30 minutes, Thanks Manager.  Right after apps came out the main entries showed up and while I wasn't overly excited about my Club I was impressed with the appearance of the plate.  Of course Club sandwiches are stacked so unhinging my jaw to take a bit is always fun and this Club certainly proved to be about standard in taste and appearance. I was finally happy with something I had ordered although I only ate half the Club (gotta save room for Desert)  Desert was Adams Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple Cheesecake and certainly without a doubt worth every penny!  Hats of to the waitress for giving me updates on the beer tap, however, they never got it working so went beerless but I do appreciate the attempt.  Overall, this experience was good and my food was improved from the other times (pre-yelping) but I did only order a Club Sandwich.  I would return with others but certainly not on my top priority of restaurants to eat at, even with the award winning cheesecakes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4?start=280,3.08,3.32,3.464,2.572,3.2240000000000006

So last Saturday on October 17th, around 10:30 pm, my girlfriend and i went in. There was nothing going on; as Boca Park dies around 9:30pm all week. We sat in the bar, and were greeted by our server. My gf orders a coffee, i get an iced tea, iced tea came out fine coffee was ice cold. we let the server know. and a new pot was brewed 10 minutes later my girlfriend gets her coffee. While waiting we were ofered bread, complimentary bread is nice, no knives to cut the bread or spread butter though. Well we finally ordered now we have been here for close to 30 minutes, my i get a quesadilla, she gets an omelet. On the first attempt its the wrong order. now the manager comes by, he wants to make sure we have a good experience then you Frankie our experience blew. So now he goes to the kitchen tells us he will make sure everything comes out perfect. The next omelet comes out and is completely raw, with a long black hair through it  So now we have been here for 45 minutes, the ambiance is terrible, the service is terrible the food quality is terrible and now lets hit management. So Frankie comes up to us and deeply apologizes and tells none of his cooks have long black hair, that's all well and good but my girlfrined is blonde. So he then tells us that our bill would be comped and offered us cmplimentary cheese cake. we respectfully declined as we just wanted to leave.

They sat a lady next to the 3 of us 15 minutes after we ordered and she received her food before we did. Terrible. When I finally got my entre it looked good... The mashed potatoes were great. A bit dry after a minute but at first delicious. The chicken although tasted like they had taken an entire lemon and just squirted it on top. Eek. My eyes were twitching.  So I asked the server to please exchange it for the creamy fried herb  lemon chicken my friend had. It's an 18$ dish. It doesnt seem too expensive at first. But when you receive it the chicken is pounded very thin. The outside is not crunchy like you would hope for from breaded chicken. It's nothing more than a large chicken nugget.

We were at this restaurant on 11-23-2015 at about 5:30pm.  We had decent service with one issue that was poorly addressed by our server. My little one ordered grilled chicken from the kids menu . It came with grilled chicken mashed potatoes and steamed carrots.  I reached over to try one of his carrots and it tasted funny to me. I thought it was my imagination but I noticed he left them all on his plate at the end of our meal. He said they  were not good.  I reached over and tasted one again and indeed they were rancid. I smelled the pile on his plate and yes they were rancid indeed.  I am not one to complain about things and my main concern was that the restaurant would serve them to other patrons. My wife let the waitress know in a non defensive manner about the carrots and she rudely  offered to replace them with another vegetable but we were not asking for carrot replacement, we were all done with our meals.  She was very nonchalant about issue and mumbled she would take them to the chef????? Then came back and dropped off our bill and never apologized or let her superiors know or chef or whoever she reports to. Never said a word and that was it. Picked up credit card and dropped it off hastily after she charged it.  We noticed they outline tip suggestion, our bill was 92 dollars and suggested tip was 16 dollars. My wife and I decided to leave without tipping. We have never in 15 years being married not left a tip. I worked for auto customer service for a long time and I appreciate tips and good service.  The decent thing to do would be to apologize and say that she has let the chef or her manager know and kindly apologized and removed charge.  The non tipping was far more than 6.50, kids meal price, the restaurant would have been out of.

Not sure if it was the time of day that I went, but the place was totally crowded and there were people standing from the check-in spot all the way out the front door. I wasn't going to stay, but the lady at check-in told me for a party of two, it would be about 10 minutes.  After standing and waiting for 25 minutes, we were finally seated. The table that we were seated at, wasn't completely cleaned yet. Please don't seat me if the table isn't ready! Once seated, our waitress took our drink order, which we only asked for ice water. That took 10 minutes to get to us. After about another 10 minutes she took our food order. Normally at Cheesecake Factory, they bring you bread and butter right away, she didn't bring ours until our food was almost brought out. I would've understood if she was actually busy, but we saw her just standing around multiple times. Our food came out after about 25 minutes, which was delicious as always. It was nice a warm and tasted fresh. Our waitress didn't come around again until we asked for a to-go box and our check. Not sure if she had a long day or was just having a bad one, but she wasn't friendly at all.  Pros: 1. Nicely located in a shopping area. 2. Food was delicious! Cons: 1. Unfriendly staff  2.

I ordered the Garlic Noodles that had oven roasted tomatoes, shiitake mushrooms, fresh asparagus and Parmesan in a garlic sauce. Was soo good!! 3. Mango Key Lime Cheesecake.

They always meet these expectations; High quality, good tasting food, excellent beverages, very good service, and a classy ambiance. You normally have to wait at least 30 minutes to be seated. There's a very good reason why people wait that long to be seated.  Based on my experience from yesterday, I had to give them four, instead of five stars. We were told there was a 40 minute wait, which seemed to be pretty accurate. I noticed that they wasted a lot of time, and energy on trying to find 4 or 5 parties who had obviously left. On several occasions they walked through the bar, waiting area, and exterior of the restaurant calling these people's names. A more efficient way of handling it would be to activate the buzzer, walk through once or twice calling their names, then move on. I felt our server wasn't very friendly, and a bit slow. The food was very good. I would highly recommend the crab bites, and the Steak Diane With Salmon Combination. The fried zucchini was okay... They were good, just not excellent.

Everyone ordered a fountain drink but mine was a lemonade and for some reason it took an extra 15 minutes to get when the food came it was lukewarm. Spoke to the manager and she happily took the food back to warm it up but when we got the bill she never took any money off nor did she come over when the food was brought to make sure  it was hot.

We showed up around 8 and didn't get a seat for at least 35 min after they told us 20. That's fine because the place was packed and there was hardly any room to stand. When I got to my booth it looked nice at a glance but then I found left over lettuce and crumbs on my table not a big deal either except my clean silverware was left for me on this table uncovered. Anyways I've been here before so it's not a big deal to me anyways. Our server was this character named Sean. And he was extremely entertaining and did his job well. We were rly here for dessert so what we did was ordered 3 appetizers and then two wonderful cheesecakes. Yum love both of them.

174,Shahira H.,"Las Vegas, NV",79,76,271.0,2.0,2016-02-26,"Cheesecake has always been a safe choice for my household. We all have a favorite dish here or some kind of comfort food. I use to go to the Green Valley location and we never had less than average service. However this location really needs to step it up. Reading through reviews and based on my past couple visits it's safe to say they always fall short in the service department. I mean the annoyance of the Cheesecake Factory at the forum shop is practically worth it compared to here.  Last night we order a couple appetizers and entrees and everything was ""half assd"". I checked into Yelp when we were seated and I had to refer back to my check in to notice it took over 15 minutes for someone to greet us. That was after I asked the busboy to get our server that was cleaning the table next to us. Then when the server came he asked us if we were ready to order our drinks as we stated yes he said h would be right back with our bread? Of the 2 appetizers we ordered we only had one brought to the table. Btw, don't ever order the Chicken Potstickers from here. They were too salty and nearly burnt. Stick to their firecracker salmon or avocado egg rolls. Someone at the table order the Steak Diane and Shrimp  Scampi (medium) and he was served well done. It was just careless acts after careless acts. Our drinks needed a refill we had to call on the busboy again. He took our drinks and brought them back without the straw. If we wanted Applebee's service and quality we would've went there.  We're definitely going to take our money elsewhere until they can do better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4?start=140,3.44,3.16,3.42,2.6320000000000006,3.2720000000000007

Being a waitress on the strip for six years and with the company for 10 I know what guest service is... You, are terrible. First off, coming to the table and not making eye contact with the people you are speaking to is not ok. Second your stance is confrontational, almost like you were looking to brawl. It's aggressive and not very welcoming. I would like to say you were at some point just overwhelmed with your tables but as I continued to watch you, I realized, no you're just a terrible waiter. You didn't care to engage you didn't care to answer questions and you didn't even bring me out spoons for my cheese cake. Seriously, who brings dessert and no spoons? I would like to point out that I wanted another orange juice and my boyfriend another glass of wine but you wouldn't know because you never asked. It's ok Also, I get there are busboys but if they aren't around it means you clear my table, you're not above clearing a table. For the record I cleared most of my dishes onto the dirty table next to me since my table wasn't cleaned once during our meal. I did have to ask twice for the check the second time you pretended like I never asked a first time. You're also human and not above being able to say I forgot let me go get it. But passing blame is easier. What a stressful lunch. Honestly, my cheese cake didn't even taste good after all this. My experience out weighed the potential to have a good lunch. It will be a while if I ever come back to eat here I would be too afraid to have your section.

I figured I'd try them again after the fiasco at the Green Valley one, where I felt bias from our server, which was evident from the poor service and lack of water refills and bread, compared to the tables surrounding us. A bit of a slap on the face to see them patronizing the ladies sitting next to you with the attentive service. Kind of overt if you ask me. Normally my dad tips really well too but he had it with this kind of service. I tip 15-20% but he tips 30-40%, sometimes 100%. So back to this location. I ordered spaghetti. Sorry, nothing exciting here. Just had a craving for plain old spaghetti and giant meatballs. Which is what I got, fat meatballs and spaghetti that was cooked right. The sauce is salty enough and you get a heaping plate of noodles that can feed two. And the server treated us like everyone else, as in didn't tell us that they didn't have any rolls and then bring it out to the next table 3 minutes later, or the table across from them a few minutes later. Yeah, we got the point. You won't catch me going to Green Valley Cheesecake Factory again. Generally, I always liked CF, from Caesars to Boca Park to GV, to every other one I tried in LA and Seattle.

When I got home, however, it turns out the there was NO sour cream or guacamole on or around the burrito.

Even longer for the bread. When ordering, my mother was making sure her meal came with chicken and the waiter, in a disrespectful and condescending tone said, ""of course it comes with chicken, it's in the name."" When my mother pointed out it does not say chicken in the name he continued to argue with her. I can't even tell you how long it took for our actual meals to come out and when they did my friends order was wrong and mine, being the last one out, finally came when everyone in my party was done eating!! Before my sandwich finally came one of the managers came to sort of apologize and quickly left our table before we could even express our unhappiness. The final straw was when our waiter was clearly trying to be rid of us, moving too quickly to hand us boxes and our boxed up cheesecake, he knocked over my half drunk (overly expensive) drink all over my phone and all down the front of me.

The table we were seated at was filthy and there were leaves in my table setting. The server was manic and obviously under trained and over worked. Long story short drinks (not from the bar) took 15 minutes to get to our table, we had to ask for a sugar caddy 4 times, and we didn't see our entrees until 50 minutes later. The manager was condescending when he brought our food because of the obvious disaster. He stated that he thought we had only been waiting 24 minutes! Basically calling my boyfriend a liar.

Last year I was able to purchase three cheesecakes by myself at another location. Anyway, it would've been fine if he could only purchase the two at half-off, but this cashier should've informed him if they had a limit so he didn't have to go through the trouble of returning it.

The waiter at the table next to us told his frustrated customers that the kitchen was backed up.  We eventually got our food. It was delicious but I never got my Parmesan cheese. This is one of my favorite parts, it had crossed my mind the maybe they did not do this anymore but the person at the table next to us had been asked and received some. We didn't see our waitress again for a very long time. It was very frustrating because of the time it had taken to receive our food my 5 year old was already restless and I was already ready to order dessert and get the check but took forever for her to arrive.  We had even asked eachother if it would even be worth it to order enough thing because of how much time it was taking for the simple things like asking for a refill or anything it was another 15 minutes  The cheesecake I always receive... The original was drenched with sour cream topping ... It was gross. Normally they have just enough to taste with the whip cream but this thing was covered in it. We took a few bites and left it .  I'm so disappointed because as I did this is my favorite place. One of the best things being the service and food and both things were a disappointment this time .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4?start=80,3.08,3.2,3.312,3.308,3.1520000000000006

This time around i""m with my wife and 4 year old son. After we ordered our drinks we received our complimentary bread. Our server brought out my son his own small bread plate with sliced bananas. Thought that was excellent, never seen that before! We both had separate chicken dishes. They wete ordered and in no time, on a Friday night they were at our table. I'd say they were faster than Jimmy John's. We split with our son and he gobbled it all up. She had the chicken picata an I had the chicken marsala. Both were fantastic.  Now time for dessert. Cheesecake Factory is famous for what? Their Cheesecake!!! Oh my, decision, decision, decision! There is just so much how can 1 person plus a 4 yeat old decide? Seems I'm sharing with my son so he'll decide.  So it's decided, the Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake. The cake was enormous so we split it amongst us. The only thing i didn't really care for was the whipped cream. It had a blan taste but overall it was fantastic.  Our server was great. He was busy however he went above my expectations. Food was great and served quickly. Our drinks were refreshed even when we didn't ask.  I think 1 thing they could improve on is the lighting. We sat in a part of the restaurant that the overhead lights were high in the ceiling which made it hard to read the menu.  Overall we're beyond satisfied.

We were presented with menus and water, and as I was explaining the bowl concept to them, I suddenly had a Duh! moment, and realized that the very next night we were going to meet a group of neighbors for Happy Hour in this very restaurant.  We had already decided that at HH we'd order two Fresh Market big bowls instead of the HH apps, so that we could take home leftovers, my favorite meal.  But we didn't remember any of that when we set out for Mixx.  We certainly weren't going to do that two nights in a row.  So, completely chagrined, we told the waitress we'd see her tomorrow night.  Cheesecake Factory, being right next door, was the obvious substitute, since we didn't want to start thinking all over again. All four of us ordered from the Skinnylicious menu, probably in atonement for the excesses of Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's.  Our friend had the Flatbread with Pear and Blue Cheese, and loved it.  His wife had the Lettuce Wraps, picking the Asian ""tacos.""  The dish looked beautiful, and she enjoyed it. My husband ordered a Turkey and Avocado sandwich, which came on a bun with a bowl of salad, and he liked his, too. And then there was me, deciding on the skinny version of the Turkey Burger. Wanting a change from buns, I chose the wheat baguette. And ranch on the side for my salad.  As soon as my fork touched the burger, it fell apart, but it tasted okay.  But that wheat baguette was no wheat baguette.  It was more like pumpernickel, and it was SWEET!  So were the caramelized onions - adding sugar is a sloppy shortcut for the slow cooking that renders them naturally sweet.  My salad didn't come with the ranch dressing I asked for.  Instead, it had the house dressing already on it.  Lots of it.  When the waiter brought a new salad and the ranch, that dressing turned out to be strangely sweet, too.  Sweet ranch??? Yuk, and yuk also for the salad, which was a sizable portion, but completely different from the one my husband got.  Not my kind of mix. Service was impersonally okay, but just average.  Three of us four liked what we ordered.  I'm the outlier, but I'm the one writing the review, so I get to give it three stars.  And I'm being generous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4?start=20,3.56,3.33,3.332,2.9880000000000004,3.422

I usually have crazy dining experiences with this place however I started to learn what exactly to come for. If you are a Cheesecake Factory fan you know that the menu is insanely overwhelming so it really takes patience to figure out what you want. I was introduced to there short window happy hour (4pm-6pm) a few months ago and fell in love! The prices are so doable and you really can get a bang for your buck when it comes to both the food and the drinks! I went in to this location hoping it would be just as good as the other one that's in the Premium Outlets! It was! Not only is this one closer to home, but it's more fancy and the service was great! Our server was very friendly and attentive! She was even able to get me to try some new appetizers that I've never tried before which was the nachos! That's always a good way to win me over as a customer when you can have great conversation, make suggestions and extremely attentive! Can you say Great Tip '-) For these nachos to be just an appetizer you can easily share with another person. If you're like me and want to take advantage of the entire happy hour menu grab some friends and order everything on the menu. Ball out! My suggestion would be to go not right at 4PM which is the start of happy hour because finding a table top or even a table in the bar area is competitive. You literally have people preying on these tables waiting for people to get up so they can swoop on in like a hawk haha. I arrived around 5:15 PM which is when the first greedy crowd is about ready to wrap it on up!. After about 3 long island ice tea's in and pigging out on the spinach dip, crab dip, wontons, sliders, and nachos it was my time to GO!

51,Christine P.,"Las Vegas, NV",186,95,640.0,2.0,2017-03-16,"We went by last night to give this location another try and it was not a good experience, in fact it was worse. I handed our waiter, David N., the letter which still had the gift card attached to it (you guys sent us a $45 gift card to give you another try). In the letter it states that the manager would like to know we are there and they could make sure our experience was a better one and would like to meet us. This did not happen, the waiter stood there and read the letter so I don't know if it was waiter who did not inform management or they just didn't want to come out, but we were never approached by any manager.   We ordered the eggroll sampler and it was just put in front of us with no explanation of the sauces (never have we ordered any of the eggrolls). We had to go back through the menu to read the individual eggroll descriptions to try and figure this out the sauces but I still don't think we got it right. Now, of course this isn't the biggest deal so we just let it go.  My friend ordered the grilled fish tacos with no marinated onions and instead cooked onions with no chipotle sauce (she's very sensitive to heat) and to have that replaced with your creama (from the ""slim"" menu). She received her dinner and there was no creama, just chipIotle sauce, a very minimal amount of grilled onions (a taco had ONE small strip) ZERO avocado (as it states on the menu its served with it)  and somehow there was a pickled cabbage?? (it's not stated thats on the tacos on the menu) We asked the server if they could remake it and at this point we are getting very frustrated with the service and food. I had to ask for my coke and her water to be refilled MANY times despite the waiter always walking around. I was genuinely flabbergasted I had to ask for refills with how much he was walking by.  So, by now, after already a long wait to receive our food to begin with (the restaurant was not busy by any means from what we could tell) we had to wait another 15 minutes for her food to be remade, so my boyfriend and I stopped eating out of courtesy.  45 mins after we ordered our food, we FINALLY got to eat together and of course my boyfriends and I's dinner was cold. My friend STILL then had a problem with her order (the tortillas were not cooked) but by then we were so hungry we didnt say anything.  Now, here comes the time to pay. After the waiter took the $45 gift card off the total, the remaining balance of the bill was $42 and change. I only had twenties and my friend had her debit card. So, we told the waiter for $20.00 on the card and I put down two twenty dollar bills. David, our waiter, brought back the receipts with no change! Never EVER had I had a waiter just assume the remaining change was theirs and pocket my cash. He never asked if we needed change to verify it was his, he just took it! I asked for it back and he mumbled an apology about be busy or whatnot (which none of us believed, he was making excuses all night and the place WASN'T busy).  For this trying to be a make-up from last time for the burnt food and bad food, you guys SERIOUSLY missed again. I don't know if it's this location or whatever but we are very unsatisfied with the service and food and that the manager wasn't around to make sure our dining experience was better than the last.

When we arrived and walked in I let them know we had a party of six and I asked the girl If there was a wait and she said ""no there isn't a wait"" I said great. She takes my name and says it will be about five minutes. I was like what, you just said there wasn't a wait?????? I wasn't upset that there was gonna be a wait but for the fact she said there wasn't going to be one was kind of annoying.  I thought okay maybe they have to get a table to fit us. That wasn't the issue because after waiting about ten minutes they walked us over to a booth which was sitting next to a handful of other empty booths.  Again I wasn't mad about waiting but just annoying that she lied, bizarre right?? Anyway, the host gives us our menus and about five minutes goes by before our super,  sweet and nice waitress arrives to get our drink orders. She goes to retrieve our drinks, drops them off and I realize we don't have straws for our drinks; only a straw for my sons (which they put in). I actually prefer to do this ourselves. Again just annoying.  We wait for about five minutes before anyone walks by before we scored straws.   Next, we finally get our food orders in and our meals finally arrived about 25 minutes; after giving our orders.   The food was good and I do like that they have added the calories of their meals to menus,  as well as new items.  When it was time to pay getting our bill took forever; once she dropped the bills off it took another ten minutes before she came back to retrieve them. It was annoying again.   My last complaint was that the booth was filthy. There was dust on one of the napkins, corn dog sticks between the wall and seat as well as on the on the floor. There were crumbs all over the seats and the floors were dirty. The place really needs a deep clean. If the dining area is filthy that makes me assume that the kitchen must be pretty dirty.

This was our first time at this location, and it was great. We went around 6:30 on Saturday night and were seated in around 10 minutes. It was very busy, but our waiter was attentive and friendly. I could give 5 stars for the drink called the Georgia peach alone. It tastes like a drink from Carnival cruise ships called kiss on the lips. I have spent like 10 years trying to replicate it and can't. Now, I have somewhere to get it. It is $11 which is steep for a frozen drink, but oh my wow!!  The bread they serve is amazing. The sourdough is perfect. My husband had steak, I had the crusted chicken Romano, and my son had a quesadilla. Everything was great!  Now for the cheesecake....holy mother of choices. How do you decide on just one?!  My son (who is 6) always has Linda's fudge cake. It takes him 3 days to eat it because the slice is about as big as him. My hubby got the red velvet and that will be my choice next time because it was soooo good. I had the white chocolate macadamia nut and it wasn't bad. It's the only complaint if you can even call it that, but my piece of cheesecake was really small. The slices are always huge and mine was half the normal size. Maybe it was the last slice or whatever. Regardless, wonderful experience. Great food. Left stuffed.

Stopped by today for a drink or two and placed a togo order. I ordered a salad, full size. It was lunchtime. I  wanted to save half to take to work tomorrow. Normally I  can't finish a lunch portion but it's never enough for another meal. Well when I got home and saw my salad,  it was barely a lunch portion. I had the bbq ranch chicken salad. This is my favorite dish, so I know this salad well. I always get an extra dressing because the salad is so big there is never enough. Well the salad was so small I had an extra dressing  left. Used it on my bread. Oh did I say bread, yeah well I  ate the bread which I don't normally eat bread, that's how small the salad was. Quite disappointed. And I have nothing to bring to work tomorrow.  When I say small there were only 2 yes I  said 2 slices of avocado and the very bare minimum of chicken.  The reason I'm writing this review is because I just remembered while there, there was a lady at the bar complaining about her chicken portion was smaller than normal and the bartender took it back. Not sure if there is someone new in the kitchen and if there is,  they need more training.

Even after our server got sat another table after us and a party of 10 at the same time, our experience was never sacrificed. Our drinks were never empty, our order came out prompt and we were never in need of anything.  Tonight we ordered iced green tea with mint, the chicken marsala and chipotle chicken pasta but we substituted the pasta for mashed potatoes. And for dessert we shared a lemon, strawberry cheesecake.  Chicken marsala is 2 thin pieces of chicken in a homemade marsala sauce with a generous portion of mushrooms. This is served on a bed of bow tie pasta. The chipotle chicken pasta is a flavorful dish with asparagus, peas and chicken in a warm chipotle sauce. It's not spicy and does not lack in flavor. The portion of chicken is on the lighter side though. All entrees are served with both sourdough and wheat bread with butter at the beginning of your meal too.

The menu is massive and has just about everything.  I also want to mention the sauces and sides are amazing.   The corn succotash, creamy lemon sauce and that Tamarind cashew dipping sauce for the eggrolls are perfection.  The redskin mashed potatoes are so delicious as well.  I want to try everything on the menu but always seem to stick to what I crave.  And let's not forget their cheesecake.  The best.  One of my favorite restaurants for sure!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4?start=80,3.24,3.41,3.272,3.0280000000000005,3.342
57,Claude R.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,100,17.0,1.0,2017-07-30,We went for lunch yesterday and it was truly a disappointing experience.  I had a lunch portion of one of the pastas. There was three small pieces of chicken over powered by the mushrooms which tasted a little burnt.  The lunch portion appears to be around half the size for almost the full price. The portion size wasn't an issue since the food was not palatable. It wasn't a good value at all.  My wife got a salad off the new light menu and it was basically just lots of lettuce.  Service was slow. We had to ask for refills many times and were never offered a refill unless we asked.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4?start=20,3.12,3.41,3.26,2.5000000000000004,3.294

42,Echo B.,"Las Vegas, NV",141,121,341.0,4.0,2017-08-01,"I came here 2 days in a row for national cheesecake day and half price cheesecake. I was going to write my review Sunday, but I'm glad I waited because my Sunday experience was HORRIBLE, like 2 star bad, but my Monday experience was great, 5 star great. I averaged them out to give this review.  Sunday: We came in for cheesecake, but since we had to dine in, we git some breakfast that I didn't know they served on Sundays. The service we got the whole time was absolutely horrible. There weren't many people there when we got there so we didn't wait long to be seated. She brought us water and that was about it. The rest of the time we had to keep flagging her down to get anything from her. It took 15 minutes to get our coffee and actually order our food. Then she never came back. It took 30 minutes before we could flag her down to actually get us some bread that we had to actually ask for when everybody else was just given their bread. She was definitely not off to a good start. She kept going back and forth to the table next to us, giving them stuff and checking on them, but never came to us, unless we actually flagged her down and yelled for her. To me, that's not acceptable customer service. It almost made us not ever want to come back here. Only reason we came back, was to get more half price cheesecake the next day. We made sure we weren't going to get her the next day again, by sitting at the bar on Monday. Monday: We strictly went to the bar in hopes we'd get better service. We certainly did. We initially came for happy hour drinks and cheesecake, but ended up ordering some appetizers for dinner since the happy hour menu is pretty cheap. Thank god we had good service at the bar or we probably never would've went back. Our bartender was always checking on us to see if we needed anything, constantly refilling our drinks, conversating with us, after everybody was taken care of. We even got our bread this time right away and didn't even have to ask for it. And to top it off, we got great service during happy hour when the whole place was packed and every seat was taken.  Now, onto the actual food.  For breakfast, we ordered the fried chicken and waffles Benedict and the chilaquiles carnitas. I really enjoyed the Benedict. It definitely had a unique sweet flavor that I wasn't expecting, but it was delicious. The carnitas was a bed of tortilla chips with a green chilli pork mix over them. I wasn't a fan of them, but my boyfriend enjoyed them. We also ordered their new cheesecakes: the celebration cheesecake and the coffee and cream cheesecake. The celebration one wasn't exactly what I was expecting. It was SUPER sweet. My complaint is that there was very little cheesecake in it. It was almost all cake and a cream mousse stuff. I was hoping it was going to be majority cheesecake, but it wasn't. I can't say that is order it again. The coffee and cream one, was very chocolatey with coffee. If you like those two flavors, you'll like that cheesecake.  For happy hour, I started off with the JW pink lemonade that was pretty good. We ordered 3 appetizers to share: Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls, factory nachos and the buffalo blasts. They were all great. You won't be disappointed with any of them. They are pretty big servings so be careful how much you order. We couldn't even finish the nachos. Then we ordered cheesecake to go because there was no way we had room to eat there. We got the chocolate hazelnut crunch, Chris' outrageous, mango key lime and Reeses peanut butter. I didn't like Chris' because I don't like coconut or walnuts, but if you like them and almond joy, you'll love that one. My boyfriend loved it so much, he ate the whole thing in one sitting. I really enjoyed the other three tho. The hazelnut crunch is really good. The Reeses is really rich, but great if you like chocolate and peanut butter. The mango cheesecake us really tart, but great if you like those flavors.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4?start=20,3.08,3.38,3.26,2.9280000000000004,3.2600000000000007

My beer was forgotten about & after a reminder it arrive when I was half finished. My wife's plate was taken to be wrapped & forgotten about but was bought out after another reminder. We split a pice of cheesecake but couldn't finish it because it was sooooo overly sweet. Other than that the food was about average for a Marie Callender's but twice the price.

Secondly, I told the lady on the phone I wanted everything extra spicy she said that she could make it ""a little"" more spicy which that was something I didn't want to hear after I said I wanted it EXTRA SPICY and told her twice over the phone to ensure it was understood that I wasn't it extra spicy! They couldn't make the buffalo blast more spicy, which was understandable. As for the Cajun jambalaya pasta which was suppose to be somewhat spicy to start hence the name ""Cajun"" jambalaya pasta wasn't spicy at all. My girlfriend ended up eating the shrimp and chicken out and giving the pasta to the kids since it wasn't one spec of spice in sight.  As for the buffalo blast, everything fell apart and it was hardly any blue cheese.

Side note, you can buy the ranch and all of their dressings to-go.  So we all order and then wait for our food. I expected there to be a long wait but it was pretty quick.

When our server comes back, he apologizes and says he will get those out right away. 20 minutes later, me and grandma still have no food. Everyone else is pretty much done eating at this point. Finally our food shows up, and by this time my appetite is gone so I take everything to go. We also ordered cheesecake, because duh. I ordered the pumpkin, (seasonal) and since it was my birthday, they brought it out singing. I love being embarrassed on my birthday, said no one ever.

Everybody were really nice there, the host (RYAN & VADA), our server ( I forgot his name roberto or ricardo) They have a lot of food selections & specialty under 500 calories also a lot of cheesecake to choose from  Their lunch special from 11am-5pm. Each of us order different food. Maybe you think a little bit pricey but you get a lot of food. We were not even eat half of our food, too much food so We all have left over to take it with us . We all love with our ordered We had a strawberry cheesecake (their original cheesecake top with a big piece of strawberry & a little bit strawberry sauce) & fries to share. Their fries is what  fries should be, I wish other places that sell fries do what like this place do. It is hard to explain but We love it I ordered chicken bellagio $16.59 - 2 pcs crispy coated chicken breast over basil pasta & parmesan cream sauce top with prosciutto & urugula salad. REALLY REALLY GOOD I also ordered a slice of chocolate hazelnut crunch cheesecake to go but I prefer their original. We will definitely come back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4,3.16,3.22,3.228,,3.1960000000000006

I really loved the ambience of this place, exterior and interior. We came on a Monday night and were seated right away although there were larger parties ahead of us. I got the spicy cashew chicken and my bf got the carne asada steak medallions. Both were very good, especially the first bite of my spicy cashew chicken. It had strong flavorings but wasn't as spicy as the name. My server knew so he brought out chili peppers for me, which kinda helped! It was good but got kind of salty after a while so I decided to take it home for lunch the next day. We also wanted dessert and since the place is called Cheesecake Factory we opted for a slice of regular cheesecake. It was pretty sweet but eating it with the whipped cream given definitely complemented the taste! Overall, I would come back and maybe try the other dishes!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4?start=40,3.16,3.25,3.24,,3.214

Who doesn't like cheesecake?! & when you add a restaurant where the servers applaud you for eating dessert before dinner, why would you NOT go?  It wasn't my first time at this location, but it seemed like a LARGER location than the others around town. The wait was approximately 20 minutes, so my friends & I bought and ate a mango lime cheesecake first. It was tart, the ingredients perfectly blended, perfect for my sweeeet tooth.

28,Dana G.,"Las Vegas, NV",12,46,4.0,5.0,2017-11-06,"Normally I don't review chain eateries but I'm feeling inspired after tonight's takeaway dinner. It's all too easy for National chains to slip into mediocrity (my fave eatery phrase). Many start with ideals of quality, sourcing, and customer care, and get shoddy over the years. Not so for the Cheesecake Factory. Year after year, ingredient quality, service and food prep stay at a superb level. Tonight: Sheila's chicken and avocado salad. The greens were super-fresh and included chicory, arugula, and baby spinach. Crispy won-tons (I removed mine), cashews, moist breast slices, perfectly ripe avo's, and a few other items rounded things off. As a carb-conscious diner with a healthy appetite, this dish was most satisfying. In the past, I've also enjoyed the Asian chicken salad, grilled salmon with mashed (ok, it was a carb-splurge day ;) and 3-4 other dishes I can't recall. Their managers are even gracious if there's ever an issue. My ""only"" humorous-complaint is their menu listing several pages of ""specialties"". If everything is ""special"", then nothing is.

82,Melissa H.,"San Jose, CA",9,51,16.0,2.0,2017-11-11,"The food is always good here, and I knew coming on a Saturday night would require a wait. We got seated in about 15 minutes, then had to wait another 10 for our waiter to check on us for our order. We had to wait about 30ish minutes for food, when our waiter came to tell us they dropped our food on the floor (try explaining that to a hangry 6 year old) and they would be remaking it asap. Anyways, the manager comes over about 5 minutes later and apologizes for the inconvenience and offers to refill our drinks for us. So another 45 minutes pass, we get our food and the bill, and I was just a little disappointed to see them charge us for the ""birthday cheesecake"" we received, and all the refills of the drinks the manager offered us. I get that I could have clarified, but from a huge chain I would have at least hoped when the manager came by to offer us refills since we were so ""inconvenienced"", that they would have been comped, or at least the damn ""birthday"" cheesecake after making us wait another 30 minutes for our food. Just a note - this review isn't about the money, it's just a shame to see that a huge chain like this wasn't more willing to appreciate their customers, they were only concerned with the turnover.

Lara was nice enough to move us to another spot and tried her best, but I could still hear the woman as well as the echos from around the whole restaurant. Ruined my date night.

36,Kierin D.,"North Las Vegas, NV",3,14,1.0,2.0,2017-12-08,"Several weeks ago, our family had dinner at The Cheesecake Factory on Rampart. It is a familiar place that we can go because of the variety of foods. No one in the family can go wrong with the amount of choices they offer, and of course, there is cheesecake for dessert!  Our waiter took an extraordinarily long time to take our drink order & to bring bread & butter. After we gave him the drink order, we still waited an extraordinarily long time just to get drinks, and still had to remind him of a beer that we ordered. When salad came, there was a toothpick in my son's salad. Had the toothpick got into his mouth, he could have choked, cut his mouth, or any number of things. One of the side dishes we ordered didn't come with our order & arrived much later. Overall, it was one of the worst experiences I have had at The Cheesecake Factory.

23,Christy K.,"Las Vegas, NV",37,88,175.0,5.0,2017-12-17,"The Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant! I love their flavors and portion sizes (especially portion sizes for their salads). Their cheesecakes are to die for, but the calorie count is beyond belief and just might kill you (as is the case for most items on their menu). I love the brown bread they bring to the table when you arrive and their passion fruit iced tea is the bomb! Of course, the avocado eggrolls are exquisite, but I seldom order them. Instead, I found a recipe that tastes exactly the same so make it at home. Making the recipe, though, shows why their food is so good--they use unique and quality ingredients and their dressings and sauces include many, many ingredients (many of which are hard to find). I usually order a dinner salad, eat half of it, and take the rest home (asking for a little extra dressing in my take-home bag). With the remainder, I can make two more meals simply by adding extra lettuce.  The Cheesecake Factory is not cheap so is truly a special treat. They offer take-out so are a great option when traveling and don't feel like going out to eat or ordering room service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4,3.28,3.3,3.26,,3.2920000000000003

I have come here so many times for family events and despite our hopes the service will get better it never seems to. The knowlege of our server was unacceptable. Showed up at 4:15pm on a Wednesday. We were seated within 5 minutes for a party of 6. I went to the Restroom upon arrival and it was a mess. Also there was only 1 stall with toilet paper. Drink orders came along and I asked oir server Tara G what they had for tequila. I was told Patron. I asked if there were other silver options and was told no, just Patron. I passed and went to the bar to order instead. Come to find out there was 4 options of silver tequila. Don Julio & Patron being the most expensive naturally.  We wanted to order appetizer, but after recieving our drinks our waiter took too long to return to our table. We ended up just ordering our entrees. I asked if my dish the Diane and Salmon came with asparagas and was told no, so i ordered some on the side. The dish comes out and there is asparagus with it, and a side of asparagas as well [which of course I had to pay extra for].  My sister ordered the chinese chicken salad. The salad came dry with no oranges.  I noticed the food runner come out and have a conversation with out waiter where they looked at the food delivered to our table. It seemed as if they realized the wrong salad was delivered, but upon us questioning it we were told no thats what you ordered. At this point we just asked for a side of dressing and oranges.

This time it was very sour and weird. The manager not only took off the item from our bill but gave us a gift card to come back next time as an apology.

You know I love to go there Say I'm actin' lightskin, I can't take you nowhere This a place for families that drive Camrys and go to Disney"" - Drake My roomie likes two things: Drake and Cheesecake Factory. And she had gotten a particular Drake song in her head and asked if I could take her to Cheesecake Factort. It was her birthday after all.  This Cheesecake Factory is located in the Boca Park shopping center in Summerlin. Not hard to find as it is probably one of their anchor stores for that shopping center. Maybe it's the location [you are in Summerlin afterall] but this location seems more elegant and dressed up than your average Cheesecake Factory. Parking can be a hassle but there are valets outside. Anyways, on to why this is a 4 star rating. My girlfriend and I took my roommate to dinner for her birthday yesterday. As soon as we entered the girlie and I took a seat while my roomie gave the group's name to the hostess. We had sat down and were called almost immediately! Talk about service.  Our server was a very nice woman named Cathy B. who was very attentive. I'm HUGE on customer service and recognize it whenever I see stellar service. She was a sweet, kept our drinks filled, took our plates away as soon as we were done eating and we were even able to get her and the rests of the servers to come over and sing 'happy birthday' to the B-day girl.  The total experience was excellent and left an impression on me. And that's a big plus because I'm generally not a fan of chain restaurants like C.F. or Olive Garden. Now on to the food. For an appetizer I had an order of buffalo chicken wings. They were yummy and had the right amount of zing to them. The best thing I had that night! For dinner I ordered the Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger. It was cooked to order and even had pork belly in it. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad. Pretty average. And the only reason I can't give my visit a perfect rating.  I did have a bite of the Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake and it was good. I don't have much in terms of a sweet tooth so I can't say that the cheesecake wow'ed me but it did was plated very beautifully. Nice job on the presentation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-4,3.6,3.34,3.312,,3.4440000000000004
