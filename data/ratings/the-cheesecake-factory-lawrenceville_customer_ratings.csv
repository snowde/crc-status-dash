138,Tammy L.,"Langhorne, PA",4,1,,3.0,2012-10-23,Wait was 45 which is not bad for a Friday night.  This location has been open for about 2 weeks. The server was good but could use more training. He never asked for our drink order an didn't substitute my sides correctly. Over all the food was great. Had to take cheesecake to go I was so full.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lawrenceville?start=120,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.5720000000000005
137,J H.,"Borough of Princeton, NJ",0,97,,3.0,2012-10-28,I'm a fan overall.  First time at this newly opened location. Brand new attached to a tired mall in real need of updating. Glad they have come to town. Food was slow to be delivered. I think we caught a shift change. But it was tasty and in good portions as always. Love the fact that the menu has so many choices. One suggestion on the fish and chips. It makes no sense to serve them in a wire basket unless they are meant to be finger food.  Not my style personally. So I prefer a plate.  Chicken taquitos were delicious. Kids chicken tenders also good. We all loved the French fries. Service was efficient and pleasant.  I am confident the kitchen will speed up if the slowness was more than just a one off.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lawrenceville?start=120,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508
75,Nancy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,64,35.0,1.0,2013-03-07,"This was my first time at the Cheesecake Factory in Lawrenceville (Usually I go to Menlo Park or Bridgewater). I am surprised by the horrible experience I had here. The food was fine, but the service was unbelievably disappointing.  Our server did not bring us bread, and did not take our order for over 10 minutes. As a server myself, I would understand if she was just busy, but she walked past the table 5-6 times before coming over to take the order. No eye contact - nothing. She brought my friend the wrong salad, and for dessert we had to stir our coffee with straws because she took away our spoons. I can't believe how someone can screw up so many times throughout one meal! Maybe she knew she messed up because she didn't charge us for our coffees. Because of this poor first impression I will NEVER be visiting this Cheesecake Factory again...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lawrenceville?start=100,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002
130,Sarah W.,"Plainsboro Township, NJ",0,4,1.0,1.0,2013-03-26,"I was expecting WAY better service from a restaurant with decorations more intricate than the Taj Mahal.  I mean the mood lighting was so dark, that I could barely read my menu, which had an advertisement on the back of every page, rendering the menu with a thickness of a small novel. The service was just terrible...our waiter's name was Sunshine for god's sake, and she was anything but.   I understand that the cheesecake factory sees a lot of traffic on a day to day basis, but we went on a TUESDAY afternoon, and it still took an hour and a half before we received any of our entrees.  I could see people who'd come before us not even having received their entrees while we were still waiting a while for ours.   When our entrees did come, I have to say, frankly, I was severely dissapointed.   I ordered the ""spring-tossed"" salad, and was met with a bowl of limp, tasteless vegetable greens.  Supposedly there was a ""red vinnegrette"" mixutre in there, but I could taste nothing My friend ordered the 4 cheese pasta, explicitely saying ""no chicken"" (as she's vegetarian),and it wasn't until she'd taken a few bites and shared some with our other vegetarian friend did she realize those odd-shaped mozzerella balls were actually just hunks of chicken.  What made it worse, was that it was her BIRTHDAY, and instead of not charging her for the pasta, as they rightfully should have, they took the entree away, and gave her a $7 cheesecake slice on the house.   Now, my math isn't that great...but a $7 free slice of cheesecake doesn't make up for the $17 we were charged, even though we didn't even eat the dish.   Bottom line: Go to the cheesecake factory if your expecting low quality service, negligent staff, and overpriced cheap food, that has so many calories packed in, you'll probably feel like you'll need a ride straight to the hospital.   I now know why its called the cheesecake FACTORY, thats how they automate their service and their food.  BUYER BEWARE;.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lawrenceville?start=120,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308
132,Kartik I.,"Plainsboro Township, NJ",0,9,,2.0,2013-04-24,"I was disappointed by the quality of food at this Cheesecake Factory. I have been to the one in Menlo Park many times and also visited the one in King of Prussia. However, this Cheesecake Factory in lags behind in quality.  I thought I would give this place a second chance and went there today with family at around 2 pm. I was hoping I would get great food and service since I was going at a off-peak hour. The service was good, however the quality of food wasn't. I was disappointed by the nachos, the avocados egg rolls and the fried macaroni and cheese. How do you mess up nachos!? The nachos looked a bit burnt and the cheese on it hadn't melted.

136,Philip M.,"Trenton, NJ",62,7,,4.0,2013-04-28,"Ok, I have edited my review, I gave them a 4 (a 5 is near impossible in my book) My original review raved about their service as my wife and I are frequent diners there.  I edited it because we did have one bad experience, the server was friendly, when we saw him, he took our order and than we never saw him again until it was time to get the check (since the runners bring out the food) we never got bread, drink refills or anything.  We ended up leaving without dessert because we were so aggravated.   Being we were there for a special occasion I did not want to bring the issue to management while we were there, however felt they needed to know about our experience since it ultimately cost them money out of our register.  As a business man I know the voice of my customer is very important and if we had these issues I am sure other customers did as well and I know businesses use customer feedback as a training tool.  I decided to contact them directly though their website and explain our experiance.  I  got a call directly from the General Manager who was very apologetic.  Knowing that they actually read my email, knew about my concern and went out their way to contact me, reassures me that they are doing what they can to correct the situation, that's all I can ask for, so we shall return. With that said here is my review on the food.  My wife and used to meet up here for lunch without the kids atleast once a week, but on occasion will come with the kids for dinner.  There is usually a wait,  you can either call ahead or they will give you a buzzer that will work though out the newly renovated more upscale Quakerbridge Mall.   With that said, it is tough to rate Cheesecake factory on food, because there is so much going on there and I have a limited diet, but for the most part the quality is good. Don't let the name fool you,  If you have a group of people who are all in the mood for something different this is the place to go, the options are endless..... sorta, huge menu but any changes are a $2.00 upcharge.  Menu has everything from fresh delivered daily never frozen seafood to their signature flatbread pizzas, Cheesecake is only a part of the puzzle.  Any one who watches Kitchen Nightmares or is a fan of Gordon Ramsay will wonder why he is not standing in the middle of this restaurant screaming every 4 letter word while smashing all the plates and throwing the menus into a fire.  At Cheesecake Factory the menu is literally a book.  No lie a spiral bound 22 page book.  There are a ton of options (too many in some peoples opinion,) when opening the pages you will get an initial sticker shock as the prices seem fairly high.  This will be understood when you receive your portion and see how big it is.   With that said not all of us eat huge portions, like my profile says, I review for families on a budget and gastric bypass patients as I am a GB patient.  With the stomach the size of an egg, I am usually bringing a doggy bag home, the last thing I like to do is order something for $17.99 and bring 3/4 of it home knowing that if my mastiff does not eat it, it will probably just go bad in the fridge.  This is the nice thing about CcF, not only do they have a ""small plate"" & skinnylicious menu that is affordable, they also allow you to order lunch size portions until 5pm 7 days a week.  As a GB patient, I can usually leave there full, only spending about $7.00 on one of their small plate skinnylicious appetizers (I like the mexican chicken lettuce wrapped tacos)  As far as atmosphere, it is very loud, there are booths and tables, I would say the place is kid friendly and the kids meals are very reasonably priced and have a good selection.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lawrenceville?start=120,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997
74,Karen W.,"Ottawa, OH",4,170,17.0,3.0,2013-06-06,"I stopped by here for a late lunch, so the place was not packed. I was seated after only a couple minutes. I had a little wait until my server came to get my order, but I was not in a hurry.  I ordered the skinnylicious chicken enchiladas.  My server did ask if I wanted the bread basket, which I passed on. I also had iced tea, which my server made sure I did not get low on. The enchilada was good, topped with cilantro (my favorite herb) but it did not have a traditional Mexican taste. It was more tomato-y, and spiced more Italian tasting. Not that these things are bad, just unexpected. The vegetables were cold, like a salad, and light and tasty. I did have to wait to get my plate cleared up and request the check. But then the server was quick on the pickup and thanked me for stopping in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lawrenceville?start=100,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.5720000000000005
65,Kari A.,"Princeton, NJ",604,7,1.0,1.0,2013-11-23,Not impressed AT ALL.  Been to many Cheesecake Factory's all over the U.S. and this was by far my worst experience.  So much so I am leaving this review when I never do these things.  Wait was at least 25 minutes MORE than they said it would be and service and food were terrible.  They were out of basic Buffalo Wings which upset my son who was so looking forward to them.  Table wasn't ready once we were actually called and we literally had to wait an additional 10 more minutes to sit down.  I live close but will never venture here again.

My wife had ordered Bang Bang chicken which is a spicy dish, it was sweet and not good. The drinks were also not so good there cocktails on menu are on very sweeter side (sugar infused).

Bistro Shrimp Pasta- creamy noodles with arugula, mushroom, basil and shrimp, tasty. Pasta Da Vince- TOO SWEET... not a fan. Gumbo- has a nice kick to it, served with rice.

It gets very busy here. They have a beeper system, but expect to wait 45 minutes on a busy Friday or Saturday night. That said, the pagers work quite a distance away and we usually head into the mall to browse stores while we wait for our table.  It's usually quicker than they say it will be when the beeper goes off.  Although it's a packed restaurant and clearly lots of frenetic energy, we have always had good service. The food is good  lots of choices on the biggest menu I have ever seen.

120,Hihihi h.,"ASTORIA, NY",0,24,,1.0,2014-03-30,"The service is by far the WORST.  Imagine every privileged little college snob working in one location; it's the Quakerbridge Mall Cheesecake Factory!  We have been there a few times now after moving to the area, and every time the service is extremely slow (5-10 minutes to get a drink order [no exaggeration], there is always the check from the last table sitting on our table still).  Last time we went, our waitress kept COMPLAINING about all of the things management makes the servers do (ie, grate parmesan cheese).  It was super awkward and made us feel weird asking her to do anything she didn't volunteer to do. My  main complaint was from how a hostess treated us.  My boyfriend and I both heard the one who took our name say there was a ""fifteen minute wait"", after a half hour of waiting I went to go ask how much longer for a table.  There was a different hostess at the computer when I went up, so I asked ""I just wanted to see how much longer for our table?"" when she without saying anything, reaches across the stand and GRABS the buzzer out of my hand and looks it up and goes ""20-25 minutes longer."" Since I thought it was a 15 minute wait, I said ""But we've been waiting a half hour already"" and she goes ""I can see that."" (?!!??!) So I said 'Well I was told it was a 15 minute wait"" to which she snaps back ""FIFTY. FIFTY MINUTES. FIVE ZERO. NOT fifteen""  And with that, we simply turned around and walk out and will not be returning.  I was not rude, obnoxious, or heated in any way shape or form to this hostess, and regardless if I was that's not how you treat a customer.  It goes without saying the food is overpriced but I have no desire to give this place 4th and 5th chances and still be forced to over-tip their servers for shit service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lawrenceville?start=120,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.2440000000000007

I enjoyed the appetizers we ordered, including the Firecracker Salmon, Dynamite Shrimp, Cuban Rolls, and the fire grilled artichoke.

I would recommend the chicken teriyaki for people who like large portions of food. but if youre a food adventurist this isn't really the place to go for an amazing delicious groundbreaking mouthwatering surprise. however if you want good service and a nice dim lighted restaurant experience cheesecake factory will deliver. I always find the service people to be really nice really charming and really gracious at their  restaurants. but maybe it's just because I'm a nice person and I'm not mean to people. but I went to the Bridgewater one and I found their service to be equally as good. so overall this restaurant is good if you want good service fast food and Americanized dishes.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lawrenceville?start=120,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.508,2.84

I really would love to understand the hype behind the cheesecake factory and the need for a 2 hour wait for dinner, I for one HATE waiting, so instead I come here for happy hour. The happy hour is one of the best in the area with great prices on a selection of appetizers at $5 on average and 4 signature drinks at the same price including skinnylicious ones for those of us trying to get the most out of our tequila.  What to order: What I most enjoy on their menu (aka most bang for your buck) is the Southern Chicken Sliders - they are really delicious and served with some great side sauces.  And my all time cheesecake factory favorite are the avocado egg rolls. Yes they are super greasey, yes you can only have them once a year, but omg.....when you take that first crispy bite of butter avocado and tangy sauce....triple bypass surgery heaven. As for drinks the pink lemonade is a good choice for those who also like drinks like mai tides or cosmos...super sweet. I prefer the mojito, that's lighter. Sadly all of the savory wonderfulness can only be enjoyed from the absurdly early happy hour time of 4-6 pm. Therefore, I rarely get to come unless I have a day off, but maybe you are a loaded stay at home mom with a nanny who just hit another jackpot by learning about this happy hour.    Oh and by all means...ALWAYS....get a slice of cheesecake to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lawrenceville?start=20,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.768,2.72

The decor is interesting to say the least and the lighting leaves something to be desired (bring a flashlight). Even at the hour that we went there were still people flowing in (around 9:30). Our waitress was attentive and accommodating, both of us were able to change the dishes we order to our liking.  I had ordered the Spicy chipotle chicken with Angel hair pasta. The spice and texture on the dish was very pleasing, the chicken bits in the dish were a tad bit dry but nicely spiced. The pasta was a bit over cooked. My PIC had the Farafalle garlic noodles which were a bit overcooked as well but there was a strong taste of garlic which I actually preferred. Both were very large portions and required another day to finish. The cheesecake as always was superb, we had the lemon meringue cheesecake whic had their delicious homemade whipped cream as well as a nice light lemoney custard filling with a hint of lemon which wasn't over bearing.

Let me start by saying I had a trainee for a waitress which I understand because everyone has to start somewhere. My wife ordered the factory nachos and I ordered fried shrimp with fries and cole slaw. The Nachos came out burned and cold with no chicken which the dish is supposed to have. My dish came out with shrimp very greasy and w/o the cole slaw. This whole experience made me very frustrated because when someone chooses to go out for a dining experience how hard is it to do what you are supposed to do correctly,especially when I spend my hard earned money in the establishment. My wife kindly spoke to one of the male staff members to get her dish corrected and it still came back burned and cold. Now I hope that the manager reads this because it's very sad to me that getting something as simple as nachos and shrimp wrong is ridiculous. I will not be returning to the Cheesecake Factory and I will be passing the word because I have had it up to my ears with these businesses taking my money and giving me horrible service.

112,Steven H.,"Trenton, NJ",76,89,158.0,2.0,2015-08-10,"Amateur Hour: save your money and go to Applebee's it's the same Food! This was our first visit to the Cheese Cake Factory at the Quakerbridge Mall and it will definitely be our last.  We called earlier in the day to make reservations and we're told they they did not accept reservations.  We arrived around 5pm and seated immediately outside as requested.  The waiter came over and took our drink order and asked the usual questions.  We ordered 4 alcoholic beverages and 4 glasses of water.  The drinks arrive in a reasonable amount of time.  I ordered the LIT which was amazing (we all know they are easy to mess up), my friend ordered a glass of red Sangria which was also good.  However the two girls where less fortunate,one ordered the strawberry martini and it tasted as though the entire strawberry (stem included) was blended into the drink.  It defiantly had a earthy taste to it.  it was drinkable but less than enjoyable.  The other girl in our group ordered a simple Mai Tai and It was extremely strong.  She was able to enjoy it after letting some of the ice melt.  We then ordered the following appetizers, buffalo blast, avocado egg rolls and the Mac and cheese bites.  We also reordered the same 4 glasses of water that we had not gotten.  The Mac and cheese was defiantly the highlight of the appetizers.  The buffalo blast is shredded buffalo chicken wrapped in a wonton like shell then deep fried.  In theory this sounds perfect but it was obvious that this was sitting for a few minutes before they brought it out due to the fact it was very soggy.  Each piece  was stacked on one another so the oil drained onto all the lower pieces.  The avocado egg rolls where good I happen to not be a fan of avocado but I did try them and I found them to be enjoyable still not my cup of tea though.  We ordered our meals and they consisted of the following, chicken marsala, chicken cashew, pasta carbonara and the spicy crispy chicken sandwich.  The food arrived in a reasonable time and other then that I felt also thought the food fell extremely flat.  I remember the food at other cheese cake factory's had a great deal of flavor to it.  To be honest while eating I kind of thought the food was very similar to Applebee's.   You could tell the chicken cashew was not freshly cooked and they other meals just did not have anything special that would justify the price range.  The chicken breast on the chicken sandwich was so large that it was impossible to eat as a sandwich.  I also was thought the point of getting a sandwich was to eat it like one.  Well at least dinner was over and it was time to eat cheese cake!!!!! We waited over 30 minutes for our waiter to make it back around to our table to bring desert menus, lucky for us we just found the menus online and were ready to order. Again 4 pieces ordered, strawberry, the new salted Carmel, and 2 of Adams peanut butter cup fudge ripple.  The cheese cake came out fast and it looked delicious.  From a visual inspection it was very clear the the two pieces of Adams peanut butter cheese cake were very uneven, one slice had a ton of peanut butter cups and butterfingers but almost no actual cheeses cake, the other slice was just the opposite.  It did not help that we ordered a slice of strawberry and instead received a slice of plain with strawberry on top.  This meal came to a grand total of $244 for four people to eat.  Granted we had three courses but for the quality of the food and the freshness this is in my opinion extremely over prices.  The service was horrible and this was the first time in a very long time I tipped only 15%.  The meals  on the menu ranged in price from 16-30$ depending of what you wanted to order.  I have no problem with these prices but if this is going to be your price you better deliver on the promise that is associated with that price.  I am the guy that has no problem going to Scarpetta in NYC and paying 24$ for a small bowl of spaghetti but that price dictates it better be the best spaghetti I have ever eaten (oh and it was).  Perhaps it's time to trim down that 15 page menu and instead of making 100 items half assed, it's time to try making 25 really really well.  Just one mans opinion however based of the other yelp reviews you guys are in a bit of trouble.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lawrenceville?start=80,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.7920000000000007,2.64

A breaded and fried wonton filled with shredded buffalo chucked and cheese. .. Extremely good Dinner: Ordered the parmesan crusted chicken. The very first thing I noticed, that my eyes hit right away as soon as the waiter put my plate down. Was a long piece of hair on top of my chicken. How do you decide to serve that to a customer and think thats ok? Dont they have someone checking every plate for presentation etc before going out to the customer? It was literally the first thing I noticed instantly. I sent it back and a few minutes later the manager came to me apologizing and offered me a complimentary soup or salad. I however declined. What ended up being extremely more upsetting to me was that my original plate had a very large piece of chicken. The new dish they sent me had 2 little pieces of chicken and twice as much pasta to fill out the plate. So that pissed me off even more. No consistency to what they serve in portions. The chicken and pasta is very good though. Dessert: got the godiva chocolate brownie sundae. It was pretty decent portion size, not much ice cream. The brownies were disgusting. They were like rock solid and had to use a lot of force/pressure to get my spoon through them. They were also kind of like chalky. Definitely would never order that again Cheesecake: it is good, however I refuse to pay $8 just for a little slice of cheesecake. Another thing they are highly inconsistent with.

The avocado egg rolls are my absolute favorite as are the Thai lettuce wraps. The dulce de leche and raspberry lemon cheesecakes are amazing.  This was the first time getting Louisiana chicken pasta and it was underwhelming as were the Mexican lettuce wraps that completely lacked any flavor. The service in this location was awful as well.

89,Patricia F.,"Somerset, NJ",7,39,26.0,2.0,2016-05-01,"My husband and I went here last night after seeing a movie at AMC Hamilton. First things first, we walked in at 11:30 pm. Okay, it's a Saturday night and the restaurant doesn't close until 12:30 am. No problem, right? Wrong. There were, at most, four other patrons in the entire restaurant. Waiters were pissed at us as we came in and several waiters stood around IGNORING us. How dare we walk into an establishment on a Saturday night a full hour before they close? My husband had to walk up to the hostess table and lean across it until finally a waiter came up to us. He was very gruff and brusque but led us to our table. The waiters in the restaurant and bartenders were being EXTREMELY loud, yelling and laughing throughout our entire time there. And our waiter seemed pissed the entire time and like he couldn't wait for us to leave. I was feeling entirely uncomfortable at this point. My husband ordered a Mac and Cheese burger with a small Yuengling, I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp with a Lemonade. I told the waiter twice I wanted white rice and he still snapped at me before walking away, ""White rice or brown?"" To which my husband gave me an incredulous look and I said emphatically, ""White!"" Our food was brought out and it was pretty good. My husband enjoyed his burger. My shrimp was pretty damn tasty as was the plantain on the side. I will say they piled it on with too much rice and it was the literal driest rice I have ever tasted in my life. I tried eating it but just gave up on it. We are now the only patrons in the entire restaurant and the waiters are getting even louder. I honestly just want to leave at this point and order cheesecake to go (the entire point of coming to this place) but our waiter has literally disappeared. We have not seen him in close to 20 minutes. Finally, a blonde woman sweeps up to our table and breathlessly asks us if she can help us with anything else or if we are all finished. My husband ordered the Snickers cheesecake and I ordered my favorite, the Cherry cheesecake. Our waiter finally shows up with our dessert order and insists I ordered the Strawberry cheesecake, and I despise strawberry cheesecake btw. So, I told him no, I ordered the Cherry. My husband starts to agree until the waiter finally just opens the bag and sees that it is Cherry. ""Oh. My bad."" We then get our receipt. $75?! With a 15% tip? Are you kidding me?! There are 5 star, Zagat-rated restaurants in New Brunswick near the State Theater we could have eaten at for less than that! At the end of the day, this is a shitty chain restaurant with delicious cheesecake. Why is this restaurant so ridiculously overpriced?! Nothing we ate even almost warranted that price. I looked over the receipt and the cheesecake ALONE was $15! Fifteen freaking bucks! Come on, son. My first choice was Longhorn Steakhouse but they were closed by the time our movie got out. How I wish we could have gone there. Honestly, I prefer the food at Olive Garden. I dont eat meat so its always a delight for me to find a delicious vegetarian meal and their mushroom ravioli is tha bomb! Theyre a bit pricey but its worth it. Cheesecake Factory is way pricey and they're *not* worth it. You're paying for some fake ass ambiance with fake marble and low lights. Its a faux upscale restaurant with ridiculously oversized portions. I still love their cheesecake so lesson learned. I will only come here for appetizers and desserts in the future.

We were seated toward the rear of the house after a 20 minute wait.  Our servers were friendly, knowledgeable, and seemed to genuinely enjoy our interaction.  We ordered a few drinks, which while expensive, were pretty good.  My friends went with the Spicy Crispy Chicken, and Beef Dip Sandwiches, and after inquiring about the meatloaf, I was convinced to try it.   The platters arrived within 20 minutes on this Friday eve, and were visually beautiful.  Both sandys had a metal cuff load of fries on the side, and small cups of sauce for application to whatever suited the fancy.  My overload one pound of well tuned Meatloaf was the star of the show, however.  The sides of Mashed with a small pond of gravy in its midst, and Sweet Corn Succotash, bracketed the meat with its own blanket of brown sauce and sautéed Onions.  I happily handed off a slice of the main attraction to each of my companions, and still had more than I could handle.  I scooped the lightly cooked veggies on top of the taters and mixed them together (an old scouting trick).  The sandwiches were enjoyed, but I watched as eyes widened in surprise as the meatloaf and mash mix were sampled for the first time.  It was a wordless exclamation, that was followed by repeated uninvited spooning into my potato stash, and excited acceptance of more meatloaf sharing.  As one companion gushed, ""Now I know what American food is! I love it.""

The food was just average, as expected, from a chain restaurant. I ordered the spicy chicken tacos which were on the skinnylicious menu. In my opinion, the tacos were not spicy at all. But, my barometer for spiciness is higher than most.  The tacos were served along with a escabeche salad.  I didn't know what that was when I ordered it; I should have asked.  As it turned out, it was a pickled salad. However the only thing pickled about the salad was the heavy amount of pickled cucumbers; they were basically pickles for all intentional purposes. I didn't really understand the combination of this pickled salad along with my soft tacos. It was not a good pairing of food.  I should have substituted a small side salad, had I known what escabeche meant. For my $14 bucks, I would have been much happier with tacos from Chipotle at half the price.  PROS: extensive menu, all kinds of food options, dessert lovers heaven with the abundant amount of cheesecake choices.

I ordered the southern friend chicken sliders (delicious), the sweet corn tamale cakes (were okay) and the crab dip (delicious). The best thing about the happy hour were the drinks. I ordered two long islands while there and I must say they were some of the best tasting long islands I have ever had. This is coming from someone who ONLY drinks LITs when going out so I've had my fair share. They were not only tasty and had the approx. amount of ingredients, but they were great to drink. I would definitely recommend anyone to come here for a drink and a bite to eat. Everything on the happy hour menu is $5.95 so you can't lose.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lawrenceville,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.772,3.2800000000000002

He always gets the burrito there that is HUGE and only $14 and he always has leftovers. BUT the other day we went there and I ordered my mom the lemon shrimp and garlic pasta to go that is on the ""skinnylicious"" menu that was $18.99. When I got home and opened the box I was so disappointed. There was 3 pieces of shrimp with a child's portion of pasta in a huge box. It honestly looked like someone ate half of the meal. Now, I understand the portioning because everything on that menu is 600 calories or less but there is absolutely NO reason why that entree should have costed me $19.

My Miso Salmon was burnt and the portion not the same as when I eat in. The same went for our Meatloaf order too. Also, our order of fudge cake ended up being carrot cake for some reason.  Although they were disappointing for the second time in the to go department I will say that when I called back to let them know they did reimburse us for the parts of the order that was messed up. I'm hoping that they will do better for their to go customers and not take advantage of their trust because not everyone checks their order (like my husband) before leaving.

They pack your leftovers for you.   Con: 1. If you are seated at a table be prepared to sit very close to other people, close enough where you can touch their arm or have a full conversation. 2. the menu is wayyyy to big in my opinion over 50 different food choices.(not a good idea for indecisive people) 3. Food below average. I order the fish taco and it came with rice and beans. The fish tacos weren't good. The shell was a bit soggy and the fish wasn't hot. The rice and beans was good, but nothing I could've made myself at home. My boyfriend had a regular hamburger with fries. He asked for well done and it was given to him medium rare. On top of that he only received a handful of fries. 4. This place is overpriced ! I didn't even want dessert. For the price of the food I would of thought my taste buds would be throwing a party. Sadly that was not the case. We would not be returning. Now we know why the prices aren't online. My fish taco was about $14.00 and his hamburger with his pitiful fries was about $11.00.

We decided on 3 entrees, a chicken dinner, steak Diane, and tuna. 30 minutes later (a bit long for Cheesecake Factory) a gentleman approached our table.

As he was telling us this, our other 2 entrees arrived at the table. The gentleman offered to bring our third party a cessar salad while she decided on another entree. By the time the salad arrived she ordered a chicken dinner.  Tick tock, tick tock... another 30 minutes passed and I flag down our waitress, she apologized again and said it would be 2 more minutes. By this time my guest decided she no longer wanted the entree and asked the waitress to cancel the order. A few minutes later a runner brought the chicken to our table, which we sent back.  Finally, the waitress brings the chicken back wrapped to go. She explained that we would not be charged for that meal and that we could take it with us. She then brings a check for the other two meals!  I never saw any manager again.

My favorite are the Tex Mex Egg Rolls and they are always amazing every single time. However, the most recent time I have been there and ordered those egg rolls, me and one other person in my party discovered that maybe 2-3 egg rolls in the 2 plates that we ordered, were one of the other varieties of egg rolls on the appetizers or small plates menu. It tasted like beef and mustard, rather than the chicken Tex Mex ones. Now luckily, I was the one who tasted that one and realized. 2 people in my party are not able to eat beef, and also, what if someone had an allergy to one of the ingredients that were in that other variety of egg rolls. They need to be careful in what they plate. Another reason why I'm not too fond of this place is because every single sort of entree I have gotten, was terrible. Whether it was chicken or one of the pasta dishes. For what it is, they are extremely over priced. There was this one time I had a $50 gift card, and I hated my $20 pasta dish, that probably costs them 50 cents or less to make. I should have spoken up, but I basically wasted half my gift card. One person in my party the most recent time I've been there, got the chicken with cashews and brown rice. He had to send it back because the rice was barely even cooked and was hard. It's not that hard to make rice, or maybe they heated it up in the microwave. Who knows. But for now on, I will only go there for their appetizers. The entrees are just crap to me and overpriced , but also, everyone has their own opinion and their own tastebuds.

24,Elizabeth G.,"Hartford, CT",69,3,,2.0,2017-08-19,"From the moment we arrived, I should of known it was going to be bad. We walked in and there was no one waiting to be seated. The hostess is looking at us but not acknowledging us for a good 5 minutes. Then we get taken to our table and NO LIE- 15 minutes pass before someone even comes over. My husband had to ask for someone. The waitress finally comes over and says she wasn't aware of that she was taken care of our table. The food was good and the waitress was quick once we actually was given one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lawrenceville?start=20,2.72,2.82,2.82,,2.7800000000000002
84,Amanda W.,"New York, NY",77,9,,1.0,2017-08-24,Usually love the Cheesecake Factory but had an awful experience tonight! It took ESP long to get a seat which is to be expected on a busy night.  Then we were seated and it took 15 mins just to get drink orders and another 10 mins for the drinks to arrive.  By drinks meaning only 1 of 2 arrived and the other drink was just apple juice.   After a long wait for a table not even having a drink or bread seemed a bit harsh.  Then I went to the restroom and there were no stalls with any paper.  It seemed as though it was all on the floor and hadn't been serviced in weeks.  Then when back to the table our waiter just whizzed by to other tables.  It was too much for us so we had to leave and go eat at Johnny Rockets next door because we were starving.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lawrenceville?start=40,2.72,2.82,2.82,,2.7800000000000002
5,D M.,"Lawrence Township, NJ",14,13,32.0,4.0,2017-08-24,Last time I was at CF to get cheesecake I was waiting in line.  The cheesecake slices were sitting on the counter for the waiters.  About 5-6 waiters were reaching over the food and some were touching the slices with their sleeves!!! It looked horrible   Also the workers cutting the slices were yapping and spit was coming out of their mouths!!!  I haven't been back there since!!! Maybe they should cover the cheesecake slices when they are sitting on the 'table' waiting for the wait staff to p/u??!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lawrenceville,2.68,2.84,2.84,,2.7760000000000002
4,Robin G.,"Princeton, NJ",842,239,1388.0,3.0,2017-09-22,"This is a solid 3 stars.  It's a chain restaurant, so I think the quality of the food is slightly superior than it would be if it were independently run/operated.  However, this definitely is only doing well because of it's name/location - I probably would not choose to come back to this location.   Let's start with reservations.  I had called around 11am when they opened that day, and made a reservation for lunch.  We were going in a big group (7 of us) and it was a Professional Development Day for most school districts in the area, so we knew it was going to be packed and wanted to plan ahead.  We showed up, and the staff had no idea about our reservation, they seemed completely overwhelmed and unprepared to handle what appeared to be a fairly typical (albeit, on a Thursday) lunch rush.  After about 20 minutes, no clear direction about waiting or a time element, we were seated outside at our table.   The server forgot multiple things we asked for at the beginning of the meal (straws, lemons) but they were brought out before the actual meal, so not a big deal.   I had ordered a salad, and the ranch dressing was delivered to the table with the iced teas/coffee.  Our food didn't arrive for about another 10 minutes (conservative estimate) and I was pretty unhappy that the Ranch dressing had been sitting outside for so long - but I ate it without complaints.  The salad itself is standard and yummy (and too big, for the official record) so no complaints there.  However, our waiter never returned to check to see if everything was okay (it wasn't), or if we needed something else (we did).  My friend ordered a Chop salad, or so she thought.  Only after stalking the menu extensively, I figured out they gave her an appetizer salad rather than the Skinnylicious Chop salad she was ordering.  She asked the waiter at one point ""is this the right size"" to which a prompt ""yes it is"" before walking away. It was pretty difficult to get a hold of our waiter for things like more water (never delivered), straws, or the check (eventually).  I think as a business, better training could be implemented to equip the staff to handle lunch-hour better.   Everyone seemed pretty pleased with their food, aside the tiny chop salad, that is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lawrenceville,2.72,2.85,2.85,,2.798

We do not eat meat and stressed that to the waiter yet after a 30-40 minute wait, there was chicken in our meals. Also, we had to remind the staff for a cake so we could cut it for her birthday. Even after all that, the manager did not even bother to apologize, or come speak with us to find out what happened. We were barely given any service the whole time, and then at the end we were not given our card back after we paid around $200!

Our party consisted of 3 kids and 8 adults. All the food we ordered were good and perfectly cooked. I ordered the shrimp scampi and the steak diane and it was so yummy! Steak was perfectly cooked (medium well) and shrimp was tasty.  I have been to another cheesecake factory and their steak was really not cooked to my liking and was a little hard and the server were not so attentive to our needs. I took off a star because our food took a little too long to come out but I am willing to come back to this location if I'm in the area.  Ohhh and of course, you can't go wrong on the cheesecakes!

The amount of time we have sat at the table waiting for our food was insane. Today, my brother and I sat down for happy hour at 4 and ordered pretty much right away. We did not receive our food until around 4:40, and two tables around us who were seated after us got their food before we did. We only ordered 4 appetizers and only 2 came out and then the other 2 after that. I have no clue what their issue is, but I always am sitting and waiting for what feels like eternity waiting for my food. What took about an hour in total should have taken 35-40 minutes. Even when the food came out, it was not even as hot as it should be, more like lukewarm. I have given this location too many chances and for sure will not be returning to this location anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lawrenceville,2.72,2.89,2.89,,2.822
