0,Ashlie F.,"Dayton, OH",26,71,214.0,4.0,2015-10-19,"As a local resident I was invited to participate in the soft opening for the new Cheesecake Factory at Liberty Center. It was a hit and I'm excited for them to be open for business! I live within walking distance, and this is a place I can see us going for happy hour or to carry out dinner. The ambiance is great - what you would expect of a typical Cheesecake Factory. The staff are friendly and eager to make the restaurant a success. The food was just what I expect from Cheesecake Factory - a huge variety of selections and large portions. We ordered the Thai lettuce wraps for our app. For just two people it was very big - so much that we were full by the time our entrees arrived. The pear and endive salad was enticing but lacked flavor, like they forgot something. The California guacamole salad was fresh and flavorful - no dressing required in my opinion. I added grilled shrimp, which were cooked perfectly. Of course, the cheesecake was decadent and fabulous. We ordered the S'mores Galore, which comes topped with toasted marshmallow and a graham cracker. Good job, Cheesecake. We'll be back when you open!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-liberty-township?start=20,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997
10,Tim R.,"Mason, OH",13,38,12.0,5.0,2015-11-01,"We have always loved Cheesecake Factory and were super excited to know one was opening literally 5 minutes away at the new Liberty Center. We finally went a couple days ago and it met all of our expectations.  The staff doing a great job and the food is delicious as always. Having it so close so we can do carry out for food or just the cheesecake is gl dangerous!!! Our favorite food to get there for me is the BBQ chicken salad, the Louisiana chicken pasta, or any number of the amazing appetizers like the avocado rolls, lettuce wraps, etc. My wife usually gets a salad or the turkey club which are great too.  And of course the cheesecake is perfect. Especially the pineapple upside down, the dulce de leche, and vanilla bean.  Love this place! Be back soon :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-liberty-township?start=20,2.644,2.644,2.644,2.644,2.644

49,Jonathan H.,"Butler County, OH",23,32,26.0,3.0,2015-11-15,"This may be the first time my kids meal was better than my entree.  More on that in a moment.  This new location at Liberty Center is beautiful and spacious, but can be a bit loud.  Though seemingly very busy, we walked in a tad early on a Friday night and got seated right away.  Service seemed slow at first but improved right away and the evening was off to a good start.   I had the spicy jambalaya, my wife the fish tacos and my daughter had the kids salmon filet. The fish tacos arrived, $14.50 for four in a rack and quite small.  The small slice of grilled fish was perched on top, with generous heaps of guacamole, lettuce and oddly, in double-wrapped tortillas. Seemed like barely a meal, and during the writing of this review, I double-checked the menu to make sure we weren't whining after accidentally ordering off the appetizer menu.  Nope, fish tacos are a house ""specialty"", disguised as an appetizer. The $17.95 jambalaya seemed stacked high with shrimp and chicken, albeit doused in chopped parsley and paprika.  The sauce was very oily...a mouth-coating that distracted me from the flavor.  I was surprised that this dish had a lot of grilled onions in it.  Too many. Is jambalaya even supposed to have grilled onions?  It didn't work. Chicken and shrimp were soft and tender so I skewered them off the top and expected to find a rice underneath.  Second surprise!  It was a big pile of pasta...does jambalaya come with pasta?  I checked the menu again...whoops that was my miss....it says linguine. Oh well, not horrible, but that's the second dish that seemed light on meat and long on filler ingredients. Maybe I'm nit-picking but I wish this dish had impressed me more.  I love jambalaya. My daughters salmon was a fairly large piece of fish for the kids meal, prepared simply and cooked well.  My wife and I took turns stealing small bites of it...very delicious.  The highlight protein of the evening in my opinion. The green beans, however, were profoundly under cooked...nearly raw.  They crunched on your first, second and third chews....took forever to chew them in fact. We're not a big sweets-loving family, but you can't go to the cheesecake factory and not enjoy a piece of that $8-buck-a-slice cheesecake.  We took ours home and split it three ways, which was plenty for all.  Very rich, very creamy.  Certainly done right.   If cheesecake is your kryptonite, it's probably worth a visit.  Food is middle-of-the-road, but this cheesecake will leave you happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-liberty-township,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412
18,Carla H.,"Cincinnati, OH",13,18,3.0,3.0,2015-11-15,"Really expected a long wait after fighting for a parking spot in the ""very busy on the weekends"" Liberty Center, however we were seated rather quickly. The lobby/cheesecake cabinet area is too small and unorganized for a busy night, but we enjoyed the atmosphere once seated. Having never been in a Cheesecake Factory before, I found the decor and ambiance pleasant enough. They have a huge bar as well for those interested in shots with their cheesecake... Service was pretty good considering the crowd. Menus are far too big in my opinion. Too many choices, so I went with something easy and familiar, the fish tacos. Hubby got the Jambalaya and my daughter ordered the Salmon off the kids menu. The fish tacos looked more like an appetizer, 4 mini tortillas gooped full of guac and a touch of salsa, with a TINY piece of fish perched on top. Black beans and overcooked rice on the side... very disappointing. Fish tacos at Ruby Tuesday's actually blow these away.  Husband's Jambalaya wasn't at all what he expected either. Guess he should have read the fine print.. Linguine in Jambalaya instead of rice?? and swimming in think oil and grilled onions. Eesh. Saving grace was my daughter's Salmon, mashed potatoes and green beans (although these were fresh out of the garden raw). Great portion and delicious- she ate like a queen! She left enough on her plate to help satisfy us hungry peasants, so all was not lost.  I'm not sure if we ordered the worst thing on the menu, but we won't be returning to test that theory. Still hungry, we couldn't leave without hitting the cheesecake counter for a ginormous slice of Oreo style to share at home. Atleast there's that!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-liberty-township?start=20,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476

He was very knowledgeable about the menu (Which is quite large) he also was very informative on specials and soup of the day.  Portion sizes of items on the menu came up several times in our table of nine dinner selection. Every time a question was asked an informative answer was given. We wanted for nothing. The cheesecake was fantastic as usual! My Husband had the red velvet. I had the lemon raspberry cheesecake.

The drinks were the best I've ever ordered from a restaurant, ever. We had a Mai Tai and an Old Fashion. The bartender was SO nice to us despite how crazy busy she was.  I got the skinny enchilada dish. The salad that came with it was the best part ... I mean, it's good, really good. I would order a huge bowl of it if it was on the menu. The enchiladas were so-so but pretty impressive when considering the low calories. Last time I had the chicken/marinara skinny pasta ...

I don't usually like going to places like this, but they do have something for everyone.  After finally getting seated, the service was a bit slow. Fortunately, I ordered the kids food for them right off the bat. One thing I like about Cheesecake Factory is their gluten-free options. My kids happily split a burger and fries with a gluten-free bun.  I'm also happy that they have several vegetarian and vegan options. We ordered the made to order guacamole for an appetizer and it was delicious. I ordered the antioxidant salad for my meal and it was excellent. I like that it had a lot of different toppings and a substantial amount of greens. I got the dressing on the side and didn't need a lot of it since the salad was so tasty.  My husband ordered the glazed salmon and really enjoyed it. It was cooked perfectly. For dessert, one kid had a scoop of ice cream and the other had the strawberries which they both loved. Hubby and I got the Reeses cheesecake and were not terribly impressed. It tasted like it had been hanging out in the fridge for a few days. Disappointing for an $8 piece of cheesecake.  The service was sluggish. Our drinks ran low a couple of times and our food took a long time to come out. Overall, the food was good, except for the  cheesecake.

31,J R.,"Dayton, OH",0,15,,3.0,2016-04-21,1 star for service - slow all around. 4-5 star for taste of food. I walked in at 11:10 and they were super slow. The hostess was talking to a server and it took her about 45 seconds to acknowledge me because the server kept talking to her.  It took about six minutes before the server came to my table but only because I had to flag him down. Really did not show any personality just more of an order taker than anything else. The food came out pretty quick and was prepared well.  I got the Parmesan chicken sandwich and it had a nice flavor profile although the bread was excessive and I discarded about half of it - personal preference. The server did check on me once but didn't come back for about six or eight minutes after I was done. I'm certainly glad that I was not in any hurry to get in and out. I got a piece of cheesecake to go and ate most of it in the restaurant and noticed a refrigerator type taste on the top of it.

3,Sharon H.,"Hamilton, OH",0,1,,1.0,2017-02-13,"We went to the Liberty Center location last night to celebrate my daughter's birthday. It's her favorite place to celebrate her birthday. We had a large party, 14, and waited a little over an hour before being seated. I really have no complaints there.....but the night got worse. Some folks ordered salads, after waiting about half hour for our salads we reminded the waitress that we ordered salads, they finally came. Our food came out an hour after we ordered it but then it came out in a couple plates at a time by the time the last of out table got their meal the folks who got their food first were done. We ordered a steak medium well and it was so overdone and dry we sent it back. We hadn't gotten the new steak by the time everyone was done so I told the waitress to forget about it and take it off the bill. We had another order wrong that had to be sent back as well. We asked for a manager, she finally came to the table took the plates back and we never saw her again. When you complain about bad service or have bad food the manager should always come back and check and make sure the situation was rectified, that is basic good service.  My husband was so upset that he got up from the table and went and asked for a manager. That is when he got Nate. Things got way worse. Nate is very condescending and rude, I was shocked at the way he treated us as customers. He insisted our food came out in 30 minutes, that was true only if the waitress rang it in late. He kept asking what do you want me to do? We didn't want a free meal or anything like that we wanted them to be aware of the bad service we received and the impact it had on celebrating my daughter's birthday. Her birthday was completely overshadowed by terrible service that spread like wildfire through our party of 14, every one was aggravated and just wanted to get out of there.  We finally left there at 8:49. We were seated at  6:40 and didn't even have cheesecake....heck we didn't even have appetizers. That's a problem! We were there to celebrate her birthday and didn't even have cheesecake. I WILL NEVER go back to the Liberty Center location. I've never had bad service at the Kenwood location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-liberty-township?start=20,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
45,Annie B.,"Spring, TX",150,24,4.0,1.0,2017-02-13,"This has got to be the worst Cheesecake Factory I've been to. We got seated within 5 minutes which is great, but we sat there for 15 minutes before even being greeted.  the bread was literally rock solid. Couldn't even break it off of the loaf. The girl came and got our drink order and that took 10 minutes to come back, then we ordered our meals (2 entrees), and that took 25 minutes to get to us and it was literally cold when we got our plates so we sent it back to get heated up. It finally came back 10-15 minutes later. The whole time our waitress was MIA. Didn't receive 1 drink refill or even asked how our food was. She finally came back after we were done eating for 15 minutes and she asked if we wanted cheesecake so we said yes and she brought a menu over. We decided within 2 minutes what we wanted, she didn't come back for over 20 minutes so we decided we were just done and didn't feel like waiting even longer so we asked for the check and didn't receive that for another 10 minutes and once she took the check and card, she didn't come back for 10-15 minutes.

After several bad experiences we're giving up on this location. This poorly designed layout breeds tempers and awkward encounters every night. Steer clear!! Go to kenwood where people can spill out into the mall to help thin out the crowd. I watched a manager lash out at two customers back to back. One was a lady asking for her cheesecake sitting on the counter ready to go. The hostess and waiters seem to follow the lead of management. The majority of our weekend evening experiences have been sub par at best. Tonight was comical.

35,Cindy W.,"Cincinnati, OH",221,116,610.0,5.0,2017-06-16,"Huge fan! You can please everyone in the group with a 20+ page menu! This restaurant offers anything from an appetizer or a side plate to Mexican, Italian pasta, or seafood! Very rarely does a restaurant cross the borders of hitting each food type under one roof-and The Cheesecake Factory does it well.  If you are looking for a smaller version of what is on the menu, check out their Skinnylicious menu. It is basically another condensed version of what is on the regular menu--but slightly cheaper and a bit healthier (less calories).  Of course, you can't go wrong with their various choices of cheesecake! They do not offer samples, but I have never been disappointed with anything brought to the table. In the mood for dessert but do not like cheesecake? No worries! They have some delicious featured desserts as well. Overall, this restaurant has plenty of seating (at the bar or at a table) for large groups or a small family or even a couple's date night. The only other Cheesecake Factory in Cincinnati is in Kenwood, so it is pretty awesome to have another version of this in Liberty Townecenter.

38,Mike V.,"East Lansing, MI",0,16,17.0,3.0,2017-07-25,"SLOW is the only word for it.  Came here at 1:30 on a Tuesday for a late lunch, told the bartender I'd be ready to order in 5 minutes but didn't see her for 10 which felt like 20.  I ordered a simple soup, salad,sandwich and it is 20 minutes later and I'm still waiting for anything to show up.  Place is relatively empty. Finally showed up and looks awesome.  Not sure if the overall lack of speed is due to the kitchen or bar staff but this was disappointing considering the time of day and relatively empty restaurant.  The chicken salad sandwich tastes amazing as does the side salad with thousand island dressing, the chicken tortilla soup however is warm at best and nowhere near as hot as it should be.  I was planning on staying and enjoying a piece of cheesecake however the restaurant is entirely too cold, by the way I usually like it cold so I can only imagine how it feels to others, so I decide to get my cheesecake to go. Found my way to my hotel hoping to have a taste of my cheesecake and unfortunately there's no fork in the bag which means I've got to figure something else out, seems like there is no attention to detail at this Cheesecake Factory.  I won't be coming back to this one even though the sandwich salad and cheesecake were pretty tasty.

Our server took our drink order and then was gone for almost 15 minutes. My wife went to see if we could move to an open booth and look for our server. The server said we could not move and she was ""looking for a sugar caddy"" to go with our drinks. When she finally brought our drinks she brought the manager with her. He proceeded to provide the worst example of management I have seen at a restaurant. He kept asking us what was so wrong with what the server did and what was wrong. I explained that we were seated first in the section and 6 other tables had been seated after us. some of them had drinks already. He explained that was a different server which really made no sense. The biggest thing was he tried to make it our fault. He was not going to take any blame for bad service. I feel like they are so busy they could care less about the individual customer.  We ended up leaving before they even took our meal order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-liberty-township,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

We asked for a booth and ended up getting a small table that was half booth, and so close to the next table over that we had to move it away so we could have a conversation without having to talk loudly. Our waitress was nice, I think she might have been new, since we ordered some alcoholic drinks and they came without ice. We got the NY strip and some Asian steak.  Sad to say, but the food was not very flavorful, nor was it worth the price on the menu.

41,Jeff Z.,"Mason, OH",0,2,,2.0,2017-11-19,"We went to the Cheesecake Factory at the Liberty Town Center tonight for the first and last time. We had a party of five that after obtaining our pager for dinner (and being told it would be a 45 minute wait) went to a high top in the bar with hopes to order a drink while we waited together. A full half hour later, no one had greeted us in the bar or even brought us water even after we looked around to try to make eye contact with a server. We noticed the couple next to us waiting with a pager was approached by a young male waiter who brought them waters. When our pager lit up we went to the hostess station and we were then led back to a table that was right behind the five top we had been sitting at in the bar. After a while, our waiter showed up who was the same waiter that had ignored us in the bar for 30 minutes (a younger man with a thick black headband on his forehead). I went to the hostess station and advised them that we would need a different table as we were not going to be served by the same guy that had already ignored us for half an hour. The Manager then appeared at our table asking about the problem and he found us a new table in the restaurant. After sitting at our new table we finally received our drinks 50 minutes after we had arrived (20 minutes at the new table). When our food finally arrived our plates were not placed in front of us but were handed to us, including the ""hot"" plates where we had to put a napkin in our hands to accept the plate. The food was decent, but the overall service and speed of service was the worst I have experienced in the year plus I have been in the Cincinnati area. The manager also never checked back with us after having us transferred out of our original table in the bar. It appears that based upon my experience tonight that the Liberty Town Center Cheesecake Factory is relying on the Cheesecake Factory reputation and the fact that they are in the Liberty Town Center for business. I have been to numerous Cheesecake Factory sites in California to Colorado and have not experienced what happened tonight. I felt really bad dropping $150.00 for service that was that bad with poor management oversight. Will be going to Kenwood in the future as they know what they are doing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-liberty-township,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003
