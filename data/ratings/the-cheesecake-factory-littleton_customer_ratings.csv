I adore several items from here: first being the blueberry and white chocolate cheesecake. Next, the apple crisp cheesecake. Last but not least, my most favorite find here: the corn cakes!!!!!!!! The salsa verde that they managed to come up with is to literally, die for. I stopped myself from eating the entire appetizer so I could take them home for a later treat. We got all the fixings on the side because my husband is anti-condiment and I am a pro-condiment and like to experiment with different combinations versus having it all piled onto one bite.

Or not...90 minute wait at 6PM on a Saturday night, no thank you. So, we went back on Sunday the 26th around 2PM as we were in the area. We were told 35 minutes, which we were fine with as we were able to run through the mall to get things done to kill the time. We were seated near a server station which was busy with bussers and wait staff constantly. About 10 minutes after being seated, I asked our waitress to see the manager and proceeded to explain to him that we his bus boys were hanging out at the station cussing and being disrespectful toward other staff, to the point that the female staff were visibly upset. One waitress even walked by and apologized to us after a bus boy flung the cabinet doors open and forcefully pulled chairs and stools out of it slamming them around at the edge of our table. Manager was polite, as well as appreciative and said it would be handled. Funny, our lunch was very quiet after that and we rarely saw the bus boys even enter the area.  As for the food, I had the Pasta Carbonara and she had the Chicken Bellagio. Both dishes were lacking their usually flavor, as they are, respectively, our favorites.

Enough for two people to share, which is exactly what I did. I got the Veggie Pizza with goat cheese. The pizza had mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, artichoke hearts, kalmata olives and herbs. It's sooo scrumptious!! After the pizza we ordered the summer raspberry lemon cheesecake. OMG...it was like a sweet light and tangy cloud in your mouth! LOVED it! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars, is the service. The hostess was super nice and talkative. Our server on the other hand...:0( She was odd. She seemed to question what I would ask for and didn't seem to have any personality. She wasn't able to hear me when I spoke, from what I can assume, because she would lean in REAL close and stare at my mouth when I spoke. I found it kind of uncomfortable, even though I was trying to speak loudly and clearly. It is pretty loud in the dining area. So...other than that, my dining experience was great! The menu is soooo huge! I wonder how many cooks are back there! Another great thing they offer is the Skinnilicious menu for those watching their diet.

They were (no kidding) about a foot away from us.  It was on a weekday night, with PLENTY of open tables and booths around the restaurant.

Any reference to Cheesecake Factory makes me think of The Big Bang Theory, and I've been to the downtown location for, obviously, cheesecake, but I'd never had a full meal here before.  A girls night to Park Meadows on a quest for sweaters led us to dinner at Cheesecake Factory, where the wait was ""only"" fifty minutes.  It would be nice if they'd let you call ahead. Once we were seated our server was friendly, although a little hard to catch at times.  In her defense it was homecoming night, and they were ridiculously swamped. Their menu is ridiculously huge-- it's like reading a book.  At any rate, we had: --crispy chicken costoletta: my friend had this and loved it.  She said the chicken was cooked perfectly and the potatoes were delicious. --chicken bellagio:  actually, I think this is the same crispy chicken cutlets as the costoletta, but over spinach pasta with a light cream sauce, topped with arugula and prosciutto.  I really liked it, plus the serving was big enough for one dinner and two small lunches to pack to work. --avocado egg rolls: I'm not entirely sure how I feel about warm avocado, but these were interesting.  My friend loves them. --fresh strawberry cheesecake: my friend had this and loved it.  It's a classic. --Reese's peanut butter cheesecake: delicious, but waaaaay too rich. --white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake: I brought this home to my husband, who finished it in one sitting with yum noises, so I'm guessing it was good. --kahlua cocoa cheesecake: my friend bought this home to her husband-- I guess it's her favorite. Other tidbits: the wine list is decent, and has some reasonably priced glasses.  No reservations and no calling ahead.  Seating at the high-tops in the bar is first come first serve, but not at the regular tables in the bar.

193,Logan L.,"Castle Rock, CO",7,77,2.0,4.0,2012-10-14,"My boyfriend and I decided to celebrate our first anniversary at The Cheesecake Factory, considering that they were open late, and it was convenient to where he was working on Saturday evening. Naturally, the restaurant was packed, but the wait was not too terrible.  The staff were very accommodating.  Our first table was in the corner at the bar, and after 10 minutes of a lady sticking her derriere in my boyfriend's face (oh and rubbing it, which was awkward) while she was talking to the table next to us, our waitress came over and asked if we would like to be reseated, and we thankfully leapt at that opportunity.  We had barely sat at our new table for 2 minutes when our waiter informed us that he thought we would be more comfortable at a booth (thank God). Our server unfortunately got double sat (where the hostesses seat two tables at a time in his section, which really throws a server off) after we moved, so he was not the most available for the first part of our meal.  My boyfriend, being the typical picky eater, ordered his staple chicken fettuccine alfredo, which he enjoyed, and I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich.  The chipolte mayo was divine, but the breading on the chicken was a bit too crunchy for me.  It was a lot of food, combined with an excellent strawberry martini, and I could barely eat half of it.  Of course that also meant that I was saving room for cheesecake.  During the fall, go for the Pumpkin Pecan cheesecake, and thank me later for the heaven that will arrive on your plate. The menu for both dinner and dessert is very expansive, with many selections.  It can get a bit overwhelming for the undecided, but there is something for every palate there! All in all, things were decently priced, considering that this is the Cheesecake Factory.  My boyfriend and I, with alcohol and the cheesecakes, spent less than $70 for both of us, which was less than what we were expecting (my guess was $85, his I won't mention to save him embarrassment). The Cheesecake Factory is a good chain restaurant, and is always a good go-to for a nice dinner out.  Plus, the cheesecake is addicting, so I will definitely be there again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-littleton?start=220,3.2,3.2,3.2,3.056,3.2000000000000006

Rule #1 of serving, don't let your guests run out of liquid. Rule #2, ask them if they want another drink... For as slow as it was you would think this was part of the 'slow food movement', but no. On top of that I ordered the tempura and they didn't even have chopsticks. Seriously? How hard is it to keep chopsticks in stock? And to make matters worse there was a terrible mess in one of the stalls and another door that doesn't lock. Bathrooms are a must to keep in order, especially in a restaurant.

He was tall dark-haired, with dark facial hair, dark eyes and semi-large gauges in his ears. Both of us were, for lack of a better word, horribly quiet and rude, and barely spoke to him, but he still stayed incredibly friendly, polite, and smiled at both of us the entire time, and still tried to make conversation. He was absolutely wonderful. He did such a good job of staying polite and friendly that I tipped him 120% because we were that awful. My boyfriend and I arrived at The Cheesecake Factory already fighting, and both of us in very bad moods. Now, I have been to this Cheesecake Factory before, and always the staff have been very ""normal"" looking. Tonight, everyone working was tattooed, pierced, with unusual hair color and all incredibly, incredibly friendly. My favorite staff so far. As for the food, the only thing ordered were 2 waters, and the small plate of seared ahi, which was absolutely divine. I wish our fight hadn't escalated to needing to leave because I would have loved to have ordered some of the cheesecake, which I love.

282,Ben W.,"Aurora, CO",0,1,,3.0,2013-07-05,"Everyone knows this chain has good desserts, and the prices are not too bad. At this particular location, service has become a low priority. The overwhelming majority of the staff are very young and poorly trained. The weird hair, tattoos, etc, are just part of being at the mall, but the atmosphere of ignoring customers is irritating. I've seen it on 2 visits in the last month. You have to interrupt someone to get on the waiting list, or to order something to go, etc. At the first visit, we waited 30 minutes for a table one evening even though we could see 4 or 5 empty tables at times. The second time, I went in to preorder a cheesecake for my upcoming anniversary. They took all my information, etc, arranging that I would pick it up about 5 pm in 2 days, and have an anniversary message on a piece of chocolate (they don't put messages on the cake itself I was told). When I came to pick it up, they had apparently done little or nothing to get it ready. I had to wait while they got a pre made cake from the freezer, frosted it, put on the topping, etc. Oh, and no chocolate, or message. So, what was the purpose of ordering it ahead of time? This took so long I didn't ask questions but paid and left. The entertainment, while I waited for 20 minutes, was watching 2 cashiers trying to reconcile the cash drawer. They couldn't agree on the total, and would count it out again. Each time, they counted a ten dollar bill as a twenty. My hint was ignored or too subtle. They had to get a third person (adult, probably supervisor) to break the tie. Another negative factor in my mind is the incredible noise level - not just conversations, but banging dishes, etc. So on balance, I will only rarely be at this establishment, but the food is very good usually.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-littleton?start=300,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.668,3.4000000000000004

We arrive to a line of 10+ parties waiting to put their name in, okay no big deal. Wait time is 65-90 minutes, decided to wait since we were already there. They were out of pagers so we had to come back 40 minutes later and get one.  Finally get seated and we are ready to order because we had plenty of time to look over the menu during our wait. Server comes takes our drink orders and runs off, tried to tell we were ready but he didn't hear. He comes back 10 minutes later for our orders. Food arrives, looks pretty good but pasta on the Chicken Marsala is dry and the sauce on the chicken is greasy. The Chicken Medeira sauce is greasy but at least the mashed potatoes were good.

Oh it looked fine on the surface, but seemed to be unsteady so I turned it a round and a big old chunk of leftover dried-up cheese was stuck on the bottom!!! Ewww gross. How could they miss that? Makes you wonder there's no QA person in charge of sanitation or even food quality in this establishment? This time around, we got sat outside (didn't even ask if we were OK with that, I always prefer inside) and were served with perhaps one of the slowest servers (albeit nice and friendly). Of course I looked really carefully at our dining ware and there we go again, both of my forks (why is it always me?!?) had crumbs stuck to the tines. Sigh.

The last time I was there, I had an atrocious experience and will never return. After waiting 25 minutes, the hostess called our party and then bolted out the door to go outside. We didn't want to sit outside but to be fair, we didn't request indoors. The hostess sat us at a table outside without shade and since the sun was starting to set, the sun was right in our eyes. We needed another chair for our party and she brought back a wet chair. It was wicker so wiping it down didn't get all the water off. She said sorry it rained and handed me the wet chair to sit on. I sat down and my shorts immediately started to get wet. I went inside and asked if we could get a table inside. The other hostess asked what was wrong with the table outside so I mentioned the sun and the chair discomforts. The first hostess who sat us outside, took us to a new table. After she was out of range from the manager and other hostesses, she turned to me and rudely stated that I should not have informed the front of the chair and not wanting to sit outside and that I should have stated it initially instead of being a poor customer and causing trouble. Since it was my friend's birthday I let it go and didn't cause a scene. The waitress we got was a rock star. She was friendly, courteous, knew the menu and gave us recommendations. The turkey burger is always good and cooked well. I think I've ordered it the last three visits. She had the staff sing happy birthday to my friend. Towards the end of the meal, I asked to speak to the manager who came over and I told her about the initial hostess experience. She really didn't ask for details or seem very concerned. I will not return here due to the poor host station customer service. The wait staff is awesome and the food is good especially considering the extensive menu. Props to the chefs and cooks in the back for pumping out high quality food at a reasonable rate. It's just hard to overcome an experience when the hostess is rude and then fires back when you bring it to their attention.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-littleton?start=140,2.68,3.02,3.02,2.7560000000000002,2.8840000000000003

I have loved it for many years since the first time I tasted the Orange Chicken. It was the first place I have ever had cheesecake. This location has really started to go down hill in terms of service.  I ordered tea (hot tea) from our waitress, Monica L, and didn't get it until I asked for it - three times. The third time I asked a different waitress who brought me iced tea in or minute from my request (one minute) - she tried and I greatly appreciated her quick response to my request. So why did it take my waitress so long? Was it because she was bringing martinis to the people next to us who asked twice? Was it because she kept disappearing for extended periods of time?  I received my tea give minutes after I got my food. Unacceptable. I have had it with the slow service and bad waitresses it is ALWAYS HIT OR MISS. Never consistent - service should be consistent. Go to the Boulder or Downtown location. Cheesecake Factory management - do something about this location before they ruin your reputation. Your food isn't good enough for bad service.  No one pays to be ignored and treated badly. NO ONE!!

I was considering ordering the Spicy Cashew Chicken dish. I've had my eye on it for a while and decided to ask our server about it since I was afraid it would be sweet (like most dishes similar to this one are). She assured me that it was not sweet at all but rather, was savory and had a nice spicy kick to it. Sounded good to me! When it arrived, I took my first bite and much to my dismay, it was VERY sweet. Not only was the sauce too sweet, but the rice was not cooked properly and was like a mush under my chicken.  She asked how I liked it and I told her not at all (this was towards the end of our meal, otherwise I would have ordered something else). I told her that the dish is in fact sweet and she said, ""Yeah, it is a little sweet, sorry I didn't tell you that in the beginning."" I'm sorry too, because I asked about it specifically! I think it was just a matter of not knowing the menu item very well. And how could she? There are hundreds of items to learn and remember! She should have at least been honest with me and said she didn't know. And, on top of that, she didn't even make an attempt to remedy the situation.

We had to ask for their complimentary bread twice for my more than hungry kids because of the long wait to order and receive our food. They didn't even offer it the first time around like most Cheesecake Factory(s) would do after placing a drink order.  Our friend's salmon was dry as my shrimp tacos tasted extremely plain. I felt like I was eating a flavorless salad with random bits of unseasoned shrimp. My children shared a chicken pasta dish with my sister (I forgot what their dish was but it had lots of cheese), which they all seem to enjoy besides the chicken that my sister said the pasta itself can do without.  The only pro is the portion sizes were large to share with everyone and take home leftovers. I can't say much about our waitress who ended up handing us over to another to go on break.

Our server was incredibly slow & needed several reminders to bring our requested drinks & even the straws. When she was taking my mom's order, she kept shouting ""WHAT?"" & claimed that she was hard of hearing in one ear... Which is fine, but in that case, she should have known better than to not double check our orders. I ordered the Vegan Cobb salad. It took a long time for the food to come out, so when it finally did I dug in hungrily. A few bites later, I tasted... cheese. Clearly, this salad was not vegan. When I let the server know the mistake, she responded with an impressive amount of sass, ""I only heard 'Cobb,' honey."" When I finally got my vegan salad, it came drenched with dressing (I had requested dressing on the side to avoid this). By then, my party was almost done with their food, so I just sucked it up and ate it. Not very happily, mind you. As if that wasn't enough... When we were paying the bill, another waiter helped us. He brought back the change and said, ""I didn't bring the 17 cents; I'm just going to tack it on as tip."" Uh...  Is that even ALLOWED? Sure we'll gladly tip an extra 17 cents, but it's about the principle here, people! My friend, out of the wonderful kindness in his heart still left a generous tip. I am still giving the place 1 star, because 1) It's not an option to give zero. And 2) the food itself was actually pretty good. I would recommend the vegan Cobb salad if you're about that life. The buffalo chicken strips & crab artichoke dip were also good. Would NOT recommend the hibachi steak. I tasted my sister's, and I swear they marinated that thing in a tub of salt for half a decade. She drank a gallon of water after her meal. Would definitely have had a better experience here if we got better service.

I can't speak to the experiences of others, I can only say I've eaten at multiple locations in two handfuls of states, and it's probably one of the top two I've been to. The service was impeccable on our visit, and the food was just as delicious as always.  I think the only ""blooper"" was the very sweet young hostess telling myself and my son to ""have a nice day, ladies!"" as we were leaving. In all fairness, he has long, wavy blond hair and his back was towards her, and she didn't get to stop for two seconds the whole time we were there.

I expect that any negative reviews represent outliers, this is one of the better run locations (and Cheesecake Factory is already one of the better chains in terms of reliability and excellent service).

The same young host, had the nerve to ask where my pager was. I looked him directly in the eyes and said, did you not take it away 15 minutes ago? He did not recall. I then asked why our reservation was lost, why no one had paid attention to the list of names as we put our name on it at 5:10 pm it was now almost six. He asks if we wanted a manager. However, he never got one to us. I eventually located one and was seated 5 minutes later. After all that, I was provided a complementary appetizer... But the servers who served us changed twice. She was not an able to provide napkins for wings. The plates sat and sat on the table, no bread refill . The mustard for the club was not provided.

Come 6:45 and then they tell us that our wait has extended to 45 more minutes. We waited 2 hours for a table we never got to sit at. So then we all decide to order carry out. We all order and we got our food within 25 minutes. How does that work?? I ordered the Asian chicken salad. The chicken was good and generously portioned but the lettuce was a little floppy.

The manager came to the table and had the worst attitude I have ever seen in any restaurant. Not only did he not apologize. He treated us like we were stupid.

33,Elisabeth F.,"Littleton, CO",32,2,,1.0,2016-09-18,"We just celebrated my daughters 8th birthday with Sunday brunch and had the worst experience. We had a semi large party of 13. I will start with the single positive and it was our wonderful waitress who was kind and caring and attentive. She wasn't even the normal waitress just the one covering someone's breaks.  Now the meal: they changed the recipe on the monte cristo and it was absolutely inedible. The bread was slimy and undercooked and completely saturated in uncooked egg. The huevos rancheros ordered with eggs over medium the egg whites were not cooked, when sent back they came out a second time not cooked. The eggs Benedict eggs were hard boiled and the French toast was not cooked. The eggs and bacon plate with eggs over medium came out with runny whites of the uncooked eggs. The meal was inedible to say the least. Not a single dish was served even warm everything was cold. Out of 12 dishes not one was hot and 6 were not edible. 7 of us have to eat again now that we have left. The general manager came out swinging telling me the meals were cooked like they always were and never once apologized. I have had brunch here numerous times and later the manager admitted the recipes had changed. The general manager was incredibly rude, short tempered and did not resolve a single issue. Our kind waitress was grossed out at the uncooked eggs but the general manager did not seem concerned in the least. He is the reason we will never dine here again and we will tell all of our friends and family of this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-littleton?start=40,2.48,3.02,3.02,2.308,2.8040000000000003

Your best bet when ordering is to do one of the lunch specials, The portions are so large you can actually split it with someone. The ice tea is always a good bet and who doesn't like free bread? If your kids bring in American girl dolls you can get a special high chair for the doll that they will put at the table with you. It's a nice touch and shows that they definitely understand their market.

I came for lunch and had the Firecracker Salmon Rolls as an appetizer. I'm definitely a fan now!! My drink was never empty, and I didn't have to flag Tiffany down once for something I didn't have. She made sure everything was in order, even though I could clearly see she was running around busy.

Here is the really condensed version of my time at CCF.  I went to lunch with a friend, we both ordered salads, which we returned them 'THREE' times because they could not get them right...Our super quick lunch turned into an hour and a half and ended up boxing them to go, in which they STILL did not get one of them right.  The manager snickered through our explanation of our dissatisfaction and, I guess in her mind, tried to remedy the situation, but fell extremely short in doing so.  I am not sure if it is the management selection or they just don't give a crap about customers anymore...I can't say my time was pleasant or the food was enjoyed.  (I ended up throwing my salad away at home as it was not worth eating a wilted salad that just wasn't made to my satisfaction per their menu).  Save yourself the trouble and go to PF Changs next door :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-littleton?start=20,2.44,2.8,2.96,,2.656

The food runner then proceeded to tell me if I send it back it would take another 15-20 Minutes I said I am not willing to wait see what you can do to fix it . The manager brings it out and its still not correct . And when the bill came they charged me for the incorrect item I told them I can't even believe your now going to charge me for the wrong item . The waitress Amanda did not even apologize nor did the manager and did not even acknowledge they screwed it up. I will never go back to this establishment ever.

When I asked why we didn't get seated, she brushed off and said we are next.  If I am the owner of the restaurant, I will prob fire her for sure.

Child's meal came about ten minutes after 12 other meals arrived. Just not good and I can't imagine coming back for anything except cheesecake. Used to be good food but not so great anymore.

The brunch menu is small but has the necessities. Most items range from $9-$15, typical brunch prices for the area.  I ended up ordering the Mexican lettuce wraps which I've never had before. I've had the Asian ones but decided to try the Mexican version. They weren't bad, they could've used more seasoning. The lettuce wrap had chicken, salsa, avocado and stringy radish. I definitely wanted more flavor out of them but it hit the spot. My fiancé had the chilaquiles from the brunch menu. It was really good and lots of flavor, I enjoyed his. We finished the meal with a cup of coffee. Their coffee is very strong so I added more cream and sugar than I wanted to. The coffee was very hot and very fresh. Don't forget the endless bread and butter, yum!!! I definitely want to try more items from the brunch menu since I newly discovered it. Their cinnamon rolls looked delicious too. I was surprised we didn't have to wait for a table on a Sunday morning and our service was fast and efficient.

21,Louisa W.,"Castle Rock, CO",34,22,1.0,2.0,2017-12-02,"My last visit here was not that great. My daughter and I had dinner here last night and we were disappointed. Our waitress was nice but forgot things we asked for just seconds before and brought items to guests who had come in well after us, before us. No biggie, nothing like getting bread 30 seconds before your dinner shows up. We both ordered taco dishes and we both got hard, crunchy rice. When we told our waitress, she went to the kitchen to get us fresh rice but came back to tell us that the white, brown and cilantro rice were all undercooked and would take some time. By now we were nearly finished eating. Nothing like black beans all by themselves. A manager came over and addressed the problem by offering us rice to go since, by that time, we were long finished with our plates. Seriously? Sure, give me a vat of rice to take home, that makes my current meal much better. I have worked in restaurants my whole life and this situation would have called for some sort of comp, a dessert, our sodas, something, not the offer of rice after the fact. You have to leave your customers feeling satisfied with their experience at your establishment, not whit a negative, lacking feeling. This doesn't warrant a return visit. This doesn't matter to this particular Cheesecake Factory though. It will always be busy, no matter what, because of the location. There will always be hungry people at the mall wanting to sit down at a familiar place. All of these negative reviews I am seeing don't matter one bit to the management. Look at all of the insincere, copied and pasted replies from them here on Yelp.
