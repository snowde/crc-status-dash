44,Beini S.,"Berkeley, CA",108,133,17.0,4.0,2012-01-04,"The quality of the food deserves is 3 stars, absolutely medicore (albeit the better side of medicore) chain food.  But the service, nostaliga that I lived around the block for years, and ambiance round it up to 4 stars. Great service, two types of bread (the rye is the best!!).   You can't go wrong with the Pasta Da Vinci or Steak Diane.  Cheesecake wise I love the Godiva and Banana Cream.  The omelette with mashed potato is marvelous as well.   If you're willing to walk two blocks, there's free parking off of Barrington if you head towards Wilshire.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2?start=20,3.52,3.51,3.51,,3.5140000000000002
49,Jensine D.,"Inglewood, CA",14,38,1.0,5.0,2012-01-05,"This review is solely for the cheesecakes near the to go pickup. I came in on a Tuesday night to quench a fierce cheesecake craving. Although I have eaten at Cheesecake Factory many times, I'm usually too full to even sample a piece of cheesecake. However, this time I had the delicious opportunity to have their vanilla bean cheesecake and the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake. Both were incredible and even came with a heart helping of whipped cream in a to-go box. Let's just say that my inner fat girl screamed for joy :)  The to go service was prompt and the cashier was friendly. I would definitely come here again if another cheesecake craving strikes again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2?start=20,3.64,3.54,3.54,,3.5800000000000005
50,Eli B.,"Chicago, IL",19,12,7.0,3.0,2012-01-30,"Nice place to have dinner on a saturday night, the environment is good and they open until late. As appetizers we got the stuffed mushrooms (yummy), and then we ordered a ceased salad and pan seared salmon pasta. It was decent but nothing special, the amount was good for two. It's a bit overpriced, but acceptable for 'LA-reality'.  For the desert we shared the original and cherry cheesecake -- wow, it was really amazing!  Some years ago I went to another branch in San Diego and in Mountain View but I couldn't recall how delicious their cheesecake was.  Accurate grades: for the overall experience: 3.5, but the cheesecake deserves a 4.5 :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2?start=20,3.6,3.52,3.52,,3.5520000000000005
46,Anthony C.,"Los Angeles, CA",156,454,334.0,3.0,2012-02-02,"Not a big fan of Cheesecake factory and their mediocre and overpriced foods (I mean seriously, a slice of cheesecake for about $7) and everything about this place is the same.  So if you are in the area and want a consistent meal than by all means come here, otherwise there are a lot of other places to explore in West LA. Another minor gripe here is that parking is valet only and on Friday and Saturdays, even with validation, it still costs money to park.  You could also try parking in the residential area behind the restaurant but it is a little bit of a walk and don't know if it is by permit only.  Hate LA parking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2?start=20,3.56,3.5,3.5,,3.5240000000000005
8,Shannon H.,"Los Angeles, CA",332,312,161.0,3.0,2012-02-07,"My fiancé and I visits this location on a weekly basis. Never really had a problem with this location except for the fact that they always seem to mess up our orders on every visit. We usually enjoy.lunch or dinner here. The Renee special for lunch is great. A 1/2 turkey sandwich with salad and soup. I suggest spending lunch here on a Sunday to experience their broccoli and cheddar soup. For dinner, we usually order buffalo blasts, wings, the Renee dinner special and a Chocolate Gorilla shake. The wings are amazing! Crispy and spicy. Don't let being on the appetizer menu fool you lol, they serve a pretty decent amount of wings that's filling. The reason I give this location 3/5 stars is because the waiters are never anywhere to be found. During a sit down lunch or dinner you may see the waiter twice! We sat in a booth once with mirrors and could see our waiter behind us in the kitchen flirting with a female co worker. We had the busser fill up our drinks twice and provided us with more ranch for the wings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2,3.56,3.49,3.49,,3.5180000000000002

6,Alekkz H.,"Seattle, WA",507,559,1042.0,5.0,2012-03-27,"I ADORE the Cheesecake Factory! I think it is my FAVORITE restaurant! I went to the Cheesecake Factory a few times now and the most recent dish I tried was ""Crispy Chicken Costoletta"" DANG! Sooooo Good! I usually don't order same dishes I have had before, only to try new ones but.. I have to tell ya, it was my 2nd time!  Side Note: I never tried asparagus until when I tried this CHICKEN! The first dish I ever ordered was Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta, which was good but don't think it suits my tastebuds, and probably won't be ordering that one again! Now I don't remember which dish my friend got the first time I went but I think it was the Caramel Chicken! I have a picture but I don't know if it was that one. How could I forget! I LOVE the interior of the cheesecake factory, it is sooooo cute! I definitely like how the servers are dressed in all white too! That is itneresting:) I always get the huge Raspberry Lemonade to go with my orders, its a bit sweet but I LOVE it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2,3.36,3.5,3.5,,3.4440000000000004
41,David W.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,207,1.0,2.0,2012-04-12,"Food was ok, would rather have gone somewhere else for the price.  The cheesecake was good, but eating dinner instead of just getting a cheesecake may have been a lot better. My biggest issue is that this place was literally almost empty and the service was ridiculous.  I had random people asking me if I was served, I had to ask for a lot of stuff that should have been given by itself.  And just in general the waiters were talking and joking loudly and just didn't seem to take this place seriously. I can take slow service, I can even take a bit of rude, but when I'm hungry and they repeatedly both ignore me and act rude, I just can't stand it.   And of course if you want to not tip you're suddenly a criminal or a cheap jerk, so you have to tip for complete crap service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2?start=20,3.24,3.49,3.49,,3.39

I have a love hate relationship with cheesecake factory. i used to come to this location often for happy hour. i mean for 5$ for most appetizer items you can get pretty full! until i discovered the amount of calories in their appetizers. i won't ruin it for you, but if you look it up you'll only want to pick at your food the next time you go to a cheesecake factory....  HOWEVER. i LOVE their ahi tuna tartar. I LOVE(d) their macaroni and cheese balls, til i found out one order has 1000 calories. their corn tamales are great too.  this location has valet parking, which isn't bad and makes parking in brentwood easier. the happy hour bar area is really spacious and the servers always warn you when happy hour is about to be over!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2,3.28,3.48,3.48,,3.4000000000000004
2,Alan K.,"Los Angeles, CA",506,1367,207.0,3.0,2012-07-02,"A friend had chosen this Cheesecake Factory for lunch. This location is in dire need of a remodel. Anyhow, there is validated valet parking in the underground garage. The entrance is on San Vicente Boulevard, but the entrance is difficult to see. The parking entrance is west of the restaurant. Validation is for 1 1/2 hours and then I believe it is $2.20 every 15 minutes thereafter.  If you had to eat here, I would suggest eating outside as eating inside reminds of a place your grandma would dine at. Also, these circular booths with the mirrors behind you remind me of a strip club. Our server Brent was really nice and prompt. I feel bad for him because there was this rude customer that was sitting diagonally across from us. I even took a picture of this lady because this lady had the nerve to steal the house bread. She was barking orders to the waiter which was so rude. She was so loud, we could not help hearing her nor laughing at the situation. We even made a joke to our waiter about the lady and he got the joke.  My friend ordered a Santa Fe salad while I ordered the Chinese chicken salad. According to him, his salad was good and I thought my salad was good. After coming to this location, I think I would rather go to the other Cheesecake Factory locations around the Southern California area just because I don't want to feel like I am in a funeral home while eating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2,3.32,3.48,3.48,,3.4160000000000004

I tried nearly all the cheeescakes on menu, and I've definitely picked out some favorites. I am glad that they still have their red velvet cheesecake on menu, especially since I thought it was just a seasonal thing.  Their salads are good, but their chicken picatta was super gross.
