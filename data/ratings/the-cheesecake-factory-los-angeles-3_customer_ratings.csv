But today I felt like broadenimg my horizen & taste what the Herb Salmon had to offer. Not only was it delicious , but what made this particular visit that much more enjoyable was that the food was served not to long after I ordered & the service was amazing. With service like that , one can't help but to tip generously. Before I finish I just wanted to add that I truly recommend the iced Mango smoothie to wash down some of that good old classic cheese cake .

868,Tracy N.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,248,197.0,4.0,2012-01-31,"Came here on a double-date. Typical as other Cheesecake Factory locations except this one is located in the date-oriented central The Grove. Perhaps this is why the lighting inside was particularly dim I assume. The beeper they gave us works well within the radius they informed us of. We got paged whilst meandering in Barns and Noble. Service was good despite having been seated in a far off corner/nook. I always enjoy their pasta dishes. Had the one with farfalle, garlic cream sauce and chicken. It was delicious. Could only eat half and saved the rest for hubby's lunch for next day. Ordered the hot artichoke and spinach cheese dip as an appetizer per usual for us. This has been the most consistent dish of all the Cheesecake Factories we've been to. Booths were cozy, as they always are as well. My favorite cheesecake is their key-lime pie one.

The food is food (nothing exceptional but not bad either). I would recommend sitting in the patio if you go there because it is incredibly loud and dark inside! The waiters vary from awesome to meh.

The food was Ok, but on the bland side.  I had the jambalaya pasta the first time --- it was a major disappointment.  I had been expecting a cajun-flavored dish full of flavor, but it turned out without any flavor --- and the pasta was way overcooked.  I had a steak the second time --- that was Ok, the meat was tender, juicy and cooked to the right doneness.   The service was very good.  The waiter was very friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=920,3.48,3.54,3.54,2.9560000000000004,3.5160000000000005
953,Jeffrey K.,"Los Angeles, CA",91,290,20.0,2.0,2012-03-14,"I came to Cheesecake Factory for my mom's birthday with my family. After a ridiculous 45 minute wait on a freakin Thursday, we were finally seated.  It took an extremely long time for the waiter to take our order, but it seemed like he tried his best to give us some attention. This place looked very busy. So after a 45 minute wait, we waited 20 minutes for our order to be taken, and then another 25 minutes for our food to come out. So an hour and a half wait to eat. Most of my family and I ordered pasta. I ordered the special jambalaya, which was decent. My fatty side loves all of the meat in it and it was huge. The downside of the pasta was it's lack of spice and flavor. There wasn't as much flavor I'd hoped for in the pasta. Some of the other pastas I tried had the same exact problem. A lot of meat, a lot of pasta, but not much sauce. The appetizers were okay as well. All in all, it was a decent dinner, with a ridiculously long wait. Without the wait, I'd probably give it 3 stars, but the wait was so atrocious especially on a Thursday, that I can not see how people think Cheesecake Factory is worth it for the price and wait. Don't come here unless you're forced. Like I was. Fatty in me loves the serving size, but hated almost everything else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=760,3.36,3.52,3.52,2.8880000000000003,3.4560000000000004

Every now and then we'll get a table with a horrible view of the bright white building across the way blinding whoever stars at it, (only at lunch time) but generally speaking you can count on a crowd, lots of chatter - so don't come here to have a quiet meal, but also you can count on generally nice servers and decent service.

The wait is long, but I don't mind shopping around while I wait for my buzzer to light up. It's kind of a given considering this is The Grove, and a major tourist attraction. The longest I have waited was 1 hour and 15 minutes on a Friday night, at 7pm. I don't think that's so bad, but I dine out frequently and am used to waiting for a bite to eat. The food is always awesome and I don't think I even need to comment on the cheesecake. The reason I subtracted a star is the waiters (not waitresses) are on the creepy side. I don't know what it is about their waiters, but they always seem to stare too long, or linger awkwardly. Be prepared for close dining quarters and big crowds.

It also took so long that the meat got half cold and the sourdough roll, though flavorful, had more in common with a rock than it did actual bread.

My joke is I never actually get cheesecake because the portions are so huge that there is no room for dessert and today was no exception.   Fried Zucchini was yummy but the zucchini seemed a little undercooked. One friend had ice water but it was way more ice than water so we had to remove the ice and put it on the bread plate and remind whoever was refilling to chill (ha! get it!?! I made a pun) on the ice. I had the chicken enchiladas...they were just ""meh"".  I was drinking soda water with lime and one of the staff just assumed I was drinking Sprite so that was gross when I tasted my watered down Sprite expecting plain soda water. My friend seemed to like her salad (can't remember which one she got) and my other friend liked the samosas.

I think it's interesting that they have the check in downstairs and seating all upstairs. Escalators take you up and stairs lead the way down.  Service was good and attentive, he was very patient despite the fact that we were three ladies all together that just wanted to talk, he was always able to politely interrupt our talking to ask us questions and to ask if we wanted to order or if we wanted any refills.  Foodwise, I ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich. It wasn't bad, but wasn't my favorite thing. Could have had some more marinara sauce on the side with it, that part was delicious. They have a skinnylicious menu also for the weight conscious out there. My aunt got a salad that she loved, although it appeared to be side salad sized at a full price.

My go-to dishes are--  Appetizers: Spinach and Cheese dip, Avocado Egg Rolls, Sweet Tamale Corn Cakes, Buffalo Blasts (ask for honey mustard dipping sauce), Stuffed Mushrooms Entrees: Spicy Chipotle chicken pasta, Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Chicken Marsala, Crusted Chicken Romano, Thai Chicken Pasta, Miso Salmon Desserts: Tiramisu You can ask for extra sauce for the pasta entrees, which is really great.   I find that this cheesecake factory makes their dishes more flavorful than the Cheesecake Factory in Palo Alto (which is weird, considering it's a chain restaurant and you would expect them to have the same recipe at each chain).

Prior to starting to write this review, I went back to read if I had ever reviewed a Cheesecake Factory before.  I have, and not surprisingly, my thoughts have not changed much.  Almost all of my experiences at various Cheesecake Factories have been virtually identical.  Therefore, most of this review is recycled material, but still relevant: I try to to avoid the Cheesecake factory because I always seem to find them having an extraordinarily long wait for food that I would consider slightly above average.  We waited at this specific Cheesecake factory for about 45 minutes, which was terrible with our active 4 year old and not many available places to sit. The service was OK.  The employees ODed on the schmoozing, and were not all that great at the details. The food was just like every other Cheesecake factory to me; overrated with unfathomably high calorie counts (if something has that many calories it better taste damn good!).  A couple of weeks back when we went here, I ordered the Crispy Chicken Costoletta.  It was pretty good, and came with some tasty mash potatoes and asparagus.  However, they have a pretty similar dish at BJ's that I think tastes much better and is much cheaper as well.   To finish off my meal, I got a slice of the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake.  It was one of the better cheesecakes I have had here, but it was nothing special.  I honestly believe that the frozen Cheesecake Factory cakes that you can buy at your local supermarket taste better than the ones at the actual restaurant.  Strange, I know.  I just think their desserts are overrated. After another visit to the Cheesecake factory I can say that not much has changed.

That being said, they do try to offer courteous service, and the menu at this factory is pretty extensive, so there is bound to be something there for everyones palate ( with the exception of a couple of surprisingly tasty appetizers don`t expect it to be that much better than a few notches above fast food quality). I have never found their cheesecakes to be anything other than ordinary, some are downright awful- and most are doused in cheap processed whip cream which is a very amateurish ingredient to add to any dessert.(Fortunately for the factory, most people have never tasted real whipped cream) At any rate, Any grievances are quickly rectified by a very fast acting general manager who really does seem to want every patron to leave the place happy and satisfied. I`d give this place 5 stars for that category alone. The prices are fairly reasonable for what you get, too.

I then went to the reception desk and asked to see a manager, waited for 10 minutes and no one came.  I was getting impatient and explained what happened to the receptionist, gave her a description of the three people and what they were wearing.  She was trying to get new guests seated and talk to me at the same time and at one point, she asked me to wait longer.  Another 5-10 minutes went by and as I was waiting, one of the young men came up the escalator, ducked as he was going thru the reception area and I immediately alerted her that one of the young men was still here and that he had just passed by.  I was sure that was him, as he was wearing the same clothes and hair style.  Unfortunately she said that she had to get one of her male co-workers to further look into this. I understand the reason the reception desk worker hesitated, but having me wait for a total of 20 minutes and not being able to alert the manager and report this incident immediately was frustrating to me.  I know this happened to us because we were not cautious enough, and at the same time I don't want this happening to anyone else.  So please be aware that there are three people going around targeting naive guests at this restaurant to try to gain access to their phones and all the information it carries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=980,3.76,3.52,3.516,2.8200000000000003,3.616

When our waitress came over, I (singular) asked her what the soup of the day was.. she told me, so I (singluar) asked her for a sample.. she came back with the sample of soup and THREE spoons... to share. I was the only one who asked to sample.. so then the two guys picked up the spoons, (mind you... one was coughing and sneezing all day  and im a germ a phob) well, I took a spoon and I picked up the bowl (bcuz the waitress put it in the center of the table). The waitress stood there shocked and seriously looked at me like I was rude.. then she was like..

We arrived in the evening with a group of twelve expecting the wait to be 4 hours or something really long, but we were told that the wait time would be 2 hours. To be honest, I expected this to be the case, but Sarah (the manager), John and Yvette (the host and hostess) were super nice and helped us get seated earlier.  I would discuss the service and food, which was great, but the main reason I wanted to post this review was to praise the staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=700,3.36,3.5,3.504,3.4760000000000004,3.4440000000000004

First off the wait time was supposed to be 30 mins, and turned into 1.5 hours. I was there with a group of friends, and we all drove here from various places like Long Beach and the San Fernando valley so leaving wasn't really an option. We stuck it out in hopes of having a great meal. It was far from that. Seating was poor, with a friend of our sitting in the aisle in a chair since the booth was too small for all of us and when we complained they said it would another 3O mins, so we dealt with it. My food was mediocre. I ordered the pasta brocolini, which was pasta with italian sausage, brocolli, asparagus and tomatoe. It was so greasy, the bottom of my plate was filled with grease from the sausage. The sausage was not even cut evenly it looked like something you would feed your dog. Big and small uneven chunks. I didn't complain because there were people at the table I had just met and I did not want to make a bitchy impression. Now, my stomache hurts mainly becuase of all the grease. If meat isn't prepared and cooked thoroughly my stomache tends to hurt, it's very sensitive. Please avoid this place, or go during non traffic hours such as lunch, maybe get a salad or cheesecake.

The restaurant dining is on the 2nd floor. Maitre D and waiting is on the 1st floor. It seems small, and was packed, as all other locations are. Food - The boneless buffalo wings were delicious and severed crispy. For the main course, ordered my favorite....meatloaf. However the taste was off. It was saltier than usual. The mashed potatoes and succotash were very good.  Service - I know it was a busy night but the waiter wasn't as attentive as I needed him to. Had to flag him down several times for drink refills. After asking for a to go box, I decided to have another slice of bread. As I was eating, the waiter removes my plate under me which I thought was a bit rude, since he saw that I was still eating.

The tables can be very close together.  Meaning you can often hear the conversation at the table next to you.  Even once had my water knocked over by a large gesture from a man at table near me.   The wait is going to be long if you go there during the peak hours.  Weekends are going to be the worst but they allow you to walk around the grove while you wait.

I've never had any issues with the waiters of waitresses, which is nice, but I did have a bad experience once with one of the managers who acted like a complete child after our food hadn't arrived in 45 minutes. The guy sitting next to us had ordered the same thing, and got his food after 20 minutes. The manager said that our item was taking a little bit longer because it was a different variation. It wasn't, they forgot the order, it happens, whatever. The guy tried lying to me to make up an excuse, which was annoying and even ruder when he was called on it. The situation was taken care of with his manager, and I was happy with the solution by the time I had left. I see a lot of the managers also seating people and even taking orders at times, which I really like.

I usually order the grilled chicken avocado club sandwich with sweet potato fries and it is always made to perfection. My wife orders either the miso salmon or their luao salad and swears by them both. Our favorite appetizer is the avocado egg rolls that come with some delicious dipping sauce. As for the service at The Grove location. Terrible.There was a party of 8 of us and we were told 105 minute wait for lunch. After 120 minutes we started to get fussy and irritable. Still no table. After 130 minutes, we decided to find out what is going on. Turns out, they were readying tables to sit our party, but someone sat down a couple at a table and to their right was our tables and to their left, our tables. So basically, they sat down this couple that divided the tables that were being held for us. They didn't want to move the couple and instead were waiting for them to eat their orders, deserts etc. Well, that wasn't happening for us. We walked over to the couple and asked if we could move them over so we can get the tables together and they agreed. We explained to the Manager and the people doing the seating that making us wait was a terrible idea, silly at best and could of been resolved 30 minutes ago by asking the couple to just allow us to scoot their table over and let us bring the other tables around them so they can be consolidated. To make us wait a total of 143 minutes what plain crap. No one apologized, comped us anything or tried to make us feel better for such a long wait. Too bad it was my wife's birthday celebration and we wasted almost 2 1/2 hours just waiting for Cheesecake to get our tables ready. When we asked for a cake for my wife's birthday, they couldn't even have the common sense to bring a piece of cake with a candle on it! Common guys.

It looked as if it was wiped down with a dirty towel or with the hand and it smelled like rotten eggs. Do they just use water to rinse these plates??? I can only imagine what the plates with the meals look like. The cup given to me for my tea looked dirty and was scratchy everywhere I didn't finish my tea because I felt disgusted. To top that off, I asked two different people to give me a cleaner plate and sadly enough, I was practically given the same dirty, smelly dish. Scientifically, if a swab was rubbed across these plates, I know for a fact it would show several bacterias present and that's what your eating. I had to put a napkin over my plate to eat my bread. It was disappointing because this could potentially be a health hazard!! This may be a small issue for some but  cleaneliness needs to be a TOP PRIORITY for every restauran regardless of  status. Some people don't have a habit of washing their hands before eating and when they touch these plates, their germs from picking their nose and heaven knows what else they pick and touch, ends up in those half-washed plates!! Gross but TRUE!!!  So Cheesecake from The Grove, PLEASE get it together and find out what's going on with your washing and disinfecting system. You served many people and I know you are super busy. If what's working right now is not working, then figure out how you can change it, get a bigger machine or hire more people to wash dishes PROPERLY.

I came here on Father's Day expecting seating to be difficult, which it was, but understandable. I was told it would be about a 45 minute wait and accepted what I was told and left with the device that would buzz when a table should be ready I went outside to meet up with my family and let them know how long the wait would be, at which point, plans were to change as waiting wasn't a feasible option. And so, I went back to return the device I was handed, but was cut off by a lady. I didn't mind at the time because I had assumed she would have to wait anyway and I was just trying to return the buzzer. As I stood there, this lady was asking for seating for the same size party as mine and instead of giving her a buzzer to wait, they were immediately able to seat her! I was outraged and furious. Instead going to down the list to buzz someone who's been waiting of the same party size, the chose her instead, a white lady who just walked in. It's very offensive and very RACIST that they'd be given such exclusive service, especially since the waiting system is electronically systematic, leaving very little problem to find someone else who's been waiting to fill in the gap.

As a large national chain restaurant, I feel it's quite overhyped, but it does have its advantages. I tried to organize the pros and cons from my limited Cheesecake experiences: PROS 1. professional and friendly service. excellent, especially for a large corporation chain. they cater to your preferences as best they can; I once asked for a different type of pasta in my dish and they were very open to substitutions/requests.  2. the free unlimited bread. I personally like the white french bread with olive oil and butter (the waiter will give you the olive oil if you ask), but many of my friends prefer the slightly sweeter brown bread.  3. the wide variety of food for a relatively decent price. steaks, pastas, salads, soups, desserts -- there are almost too many options.  CONS 1. can be a long wait. avoid mealtimes and you'll be able to get in within half an hour or so.  2. very dark inside. my eyes always hurt from straining to see my food and the faces of the people I'm speaking with. may make for an intimate setting with a date, but not really apt for large parties or families. 3. the extensive menu does include some faulty dishes; it's a hit or miss type of thing. here are the ones i've tried and still remember: Steak Diane - good beef with a good mushroom sauce, tastes superb cooked medium rare.  Shrimp Scampi - large shrimp with a slight crunch in a citrus, garlic sauce  Chicken lettuce wraps - nothing special, just some chicken and vegetables wrapped in lettuce with a sauce commonly found in Mexican places. my mom really likes them; they're meant to be appetizers, but can serve as a light meal. the lettuce adds a nice refreshing crunch when you're not ordering salad. Spicy chicken chipotle pasta - not spicy at all, actually sort of sweet. the sauce gets cold pretty quickly, and you're left with a clumpy mess of a dish.  Jambalaya pasta - the spices' balance is pretty good, but gets cold and nasty quickly as well. I don't recommend the pasta dishes here.  Original cheesecake - very good; after all, they get their name from this signature dish.  Tiramisu cheesecake - DIDN'T HAVE A GRAHAM CRUST!! i felt cheated. the tiramisu cake part was merely eh, and the cheesecake part wasn't as superb as the original cheesecake. the chocolate mousse/whipped cream on top made the dessert extremely decadent and sweet. I would stick to the basic cheesecake.  Sundae - got a free sundae on my birthday; there was only a spoonful of extremely sweet vanilla ice cream buried under a LOT of whipped cream and sitting on top of black chocolate fudge. it was free, but didn't feel like a big deal.                                               Sides - tried the fries, salad, and mashed potatoes; all are decent. just some of my thoughts on a much reviewed restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=760,3.44,3.57,3.552,3.1800000000000006,3.5180000000000002

The location at the Grove get busy, so plan ahead. Go in and pick up a buzzer before you're starving and by the time you get called, you'll be ready to eat. The buzzer has a fairly long range (from water fountain to the Farmer's Market entrance near Marmalade Cafe), so you can shop/window shop while you wait. Last night I showed up at 9:30 and waited 55 minutes for a table for 2! They don't take reservations so BE PREPARED! The seating can get crowded indoors, so opt to sit outdoors and take in the sights from the balcony.  The waiters are always great. Well versed in the menu, helpful when you're indecisive, never pushy, etc.  TIPS: + Don't order an appetizer unless you aren't getting an entree. They bring out fresh rye and sourdough bread for every table.  + There are lunch portions available for many of the entree's - always ask! + Dessert portions are ALWAYS big enough for two or three. The Lemoncello Cake is my fave but the Strawberry Shortcake is always a winner as well. + There are a couple of televisions above the bar. Last night they showed football and a Jeopardy rerun. :) One thing about this location that gets under my skin: there are only 4 stalls in the ladies room. Yep.

Yes, we may have an entire display case of all sorts of cakes ready to go but we'd rather let them mesmerize the window gawking dieters than profit off of you.  Only Jesus knows why.  How does this story end?  Drinks thrown at the manger's face?  A vengeful dine and dash? No.  We gracefully ordered 6 variations of cheesecakes and asked the waitress to at least attempt a nice presentation.  Hopefully they'd figure out how to form a pie from six slices.

I asked, when I picked it up, if there were any special instructions but they said no.  It wasn't like an ice cream cake. A frozen cheesecake is like a rock. Very disappointing as my guests could not eat it (though they made an attempt to lick it like a Popsicle.)  Also disappointing as silly me actually thought they made their cheesecakes fresh there.  Wrote a letter to the manager who sent me a generic letter. My name or date wasn't on the letter. There was no explanation. Just a generic letter they print out and mail. No sincerity. And a gift certificate, which was nice. Never doing that again. Whole cheesecakes are expensive! Not only that, I had to take time off of work to pick it up. Would have been cheaper and easier to just get a Trader Joes cheesecake and cover it with strawberries.

Of course a Cheesecake Factory is just that so there is nothing really special, however, the service and the food were both fantastic this evening. The one thing I don't like is the seating situation. If you don't get a booth, you're pretty close to the people next to you. So if you don't like others in your personal bubble and don't mind waiting a few extra minutes, request a booth   When the host/hostess welcomes you into the restaurant! I forgot my server's name(I'm sure it is on my receipt) but he was phenomenal. Just a genuinely nice guy. Not too cheesy and not a rude server who is over it. He was perfect.

People are always waiting and spilling out of the doors. Unless I'm grabbing a slice of cheesecake to go or slipping in to use the ladies' room, you won't find me there during dinner. My group decided they wanted to dine here at 6pm on a super busy evening. I was delighted to learn they can take your cell phone number and text you when your table is ready! I was excited about this and overcame my grumpiness about possibly having to endure waiting because we were able to walk around the stores while we waited for our table. They gave us an estimate of 30 minutes (and I thought... with all these people waiting here? Yeah right!)... and it was actually about 40 minutes when I got the text. Acceptable! We sat on the outdoor patio which was nice except for when The Grove started pumping the fake snow (aka soap bubbles) and it started drifting onto our food. Foodwise, having previously worked across the street from a Cheesecake Factory, I have the usuals I always order. This particular night, I had the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad. That thing is like something you can bring to a party to serve 10 people. I'm used to the lunch portion so the dinner portion was just a mountain of deliciousness. I only finished 1/3 of it before being stuffed. Other usual favorites: Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club (without bacon now since I don't eat pork anymore); Cajun Jambalaya with Brown Rice (instead of pasta); Chicken Masala; Mahi Mahi and Shrimp Veracruz; Vietnamese Summer Rolls; Avocado Egg Rolls... Favorite cheesecake: I'm a cheesecake purist so I love the original! On a wild day, I might order the chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake.

53,Cae C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,1.0,3.0,2014-04-13,"Food outstanding!  Service, way below average.   It's been awhile since I've dined here.  I remember the food always being great, and it was great again.  However, on this visit, I took note of how the restaurant took special care to label items on the menu like ""Gluten-Free"", ""Contains Dairy"" or ""Nuts"".  There's even a special, separate, low-cal menu.  For a restaurant like CHEESECAKE FACTORY, which has such an extensive menu anyway, to include extra touches such as these is, well, impressive.  I'm a diner with more than one serious allergy and it's nice to have a well-known choice in my wheelhouse, so thank you Cheesecake Factory!  You even had a piece of cheesecake I could eat.  I'm still smiling. Unfortunately, our server, was aloof when he was taking care of us but mostly not there at all.  He greeted us with, ""I'm going on my break.""  I've worked in the service industry for over twenty years and I understand breaks need to happen and there's never a good time for them; however, his opening line was terrible and the service was worse.  About ten minutes later, we received our water and bread (we were ready to order and he still hadn't gone on his break) but he didn't ask, he just dropped the water and bread and left, not making eye contact.  Finally, another server took our order.  Our food came (and it was amazing thank goodness).  I had to ask for more ketchup from three different people.  Finally, our server brought it to me after he came and went to the table right next to us about four times.  We had to ask for iced tea refills and struggled to actually find someone to ask.  When we finally received more iced tea, we were finished with our meal.  We had to ask for dessert menus and then only my friend received one, I had to ask for one too, again.  When the cheesecake arrived, we had no silverware.  Our server dropped the cheesecake and disappeared for about five minutes saying he would be back with silverware & napkins.  I'm not sure why we needed a new napkin for dessert.  When he returned he presented a mis en place filled with silverware, indicating for us to grab our own silverware, but never actually speaking to us.  Really?  Is that sanitary?!  What if I had the flu?  And I'm digging into the mis en place where ALL the other guests are also grabbing their silverware?  It seemed rather odd to me. One thing I was grateful for regarding our server, he asked if I had a parking ticket to validate.  I did.  And if it weren't for his reminder, I would have forgot.  This one little gesture is how I know our server didn't mean to give bad service.  Maybe he was new, still working out his procedure, his style, I'm not sure.  I don't write reviews often unless I feel someone can learn something.  In this case, I think it might be important to review the basics with some of the younger wait staff.  MAKE EYE CONTACT.  No silverware, no food!  Communicate but don't share information your guest doesn't need to know (find a mature delivery).  Go out!  Be a diner at least once a week, it creates empathy for your guest.  But the most important thing, ASK FOR HELP WHEN YOU NEED IT. I love The Cheesecake Factory.  It's my parent's favorite restaurant.  I send them gift certificates all the time!  I'm not trying to be harsh, just trying to help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=800,3.12,3.45,3.496,3.468,3.318

Not only that, the outdoor balcony seating is terrific and the staff is always very accommodating and friendly.  I do sometimes get annoyed by the cover artist music selection and the indoor lighting is sometimes TOO dark to see the plate in front of you.

854,Hwang J.,"Beverly Hills, CA",2,4,,1.0,2014-06-07,Last year I dine with my family party of 5. Waitress showed a small table next to the kitchen and seat us down. I asked her that the table was too small and wanted to move to the larger table next to the esclater which was empty then. She said the large table is for party of 7 so we can't be moved. But right after then 4 caucasian people were seated at the large table So I asked the waitress they're only 4 she told me that 3more people will come sooner or later. I trusted her and went to my table. We were waiting for the food at the table next to the kitchen. Few minutes later I saw something crawling around the table...it was a ROACH!!!!! I call the manager and tell him that there is A Roach on the table. He grab the roach and take it away. So I went to the counter to complain...then what I saw was there are still 4 people sitting on the large table! The waitress lied to us cause we were ASIANS!!!

Anyway we tried to brush of the glaring, shooting-daggers-at-you looks from the hostesses and just went about our business.

I had a menu in my hand to order a cheesecake later. So, my sister ordered first and then I was in the process of telling her my order when she just grabbed the menu from my hand and walked away. Yeah, we were appalled but we still tipped her well.  I want to point out that, maybe once a month, my family chooses this establishment to dine in and we ALWAYS order a lot.

My personal favorite is the avocado egg roll cuz it's served with a side of crack sauce. Entree wise I like the chicken pasta plate (I think it's the Louisiana chicken with mushrooms & bell peppers). Cheesecake wise the raspberry truffle cheesecake is amazing.  That being said, why does this location suck so much? It seems so fancy when you walk in because you enter to see the hostess section & then you have to take a long escalator (or the stairs) to the dining area. But the service is SUCH A FAIL. The servers travel in packs of 2 cuz they're so busy chatting with each other. They forget to bring your much needed cocktails & bread until you remind them 15 minutes after ordering. They tell you they told the kitchen not to add certain ingredients (ahem: cilantro) but your dish will have cilantro. They try to charge you for things you did not order.

Their response was ""they are next to each other"". Clearly someone does not know the difference ""behind and next to"", the girl was rude and did not tend to our needs. Also, when people from my party were not at the restaurant, but on their way up, our second booth was empty. Minutes later, after the host gave us a 5 minute ultimatum, they gave away our table to another party without notifying us. We asked several times to speak with a manager but no manage came when requested. It wasn't until a while later, after we noticed someone who looked like a manager walk past our table multiple times, that that person stopped by and tried to explain their rationale behind their actions.

The place was beyond packed. We were told the wait would be an hour and a half. Fine. We went to the Farmer's Market and grabbed a drink to kill some time. Instead of giving out buzzers so you know when your table is ready, they took cell phone numbers and said they'd call or text when the table was ready. I had my phone on and out in front of me the whole time. After about an hour and 40 minutes, we still hadn't heard from them so we walked back and they told me that there was a mix-up and they couldn't reach us. I was annoyed because we had been waiting for them and they had just given our table to someone else. But they realized it was their mistake so they did the right thing and gave us the next available table right away. We sat outside on the upstairs patio. You can't really complain about The Cheesecake Factory menu - it has literally anything and everything you could possibly be in the mood for. I love their bread, too. I tried the fish tacos because in all my years of coming here I never had those before. They were pretty good, but just like everything else on the menu - the portions were huge.

The restaurant is extremely impressive, two storeys high with gorgeous cathedral ceilings in the marbled lobby and the option of stairs, elevator or escalator to get from the waiting/hostess area to the restaurant level.  The Grove is a busy place, especially on a weekend so if you are looking to come here for lunch you'll need to be prepared to wait for a table, anywhere from fifteen minutes to an hour depending on the time of day you turn up- they do not take reservations. I've never had a problem with the wait time although on one occasion I visited they managed to lose our reservation during the minute it took for myself and friend to ascend the stairs, it wasn't a busy evening though so it wasn't a problem. The service can vary, depending on time of day although the wait staff are generally very friendly and helpful. Because this place is so busy their attentiveness can be hit and miss which can be irritating if you're extremely hungry. If you aren't sure what to order you can always rely on your server to give you a great recommendation!  Speaking of food... HOLY MENU! It is crazy how many items are on offer. Everything is delicious but I highly recommend the following: Ahi Tuna Carpaccio (very healthy for all you gym nuts like myself) Asian Lettuce Cups (Though the lettuce is kind of hard to wrap the contents in because of the leaf shape of the type they use) Hangar Steak (Medium Rare for best outcome) I also love their Glam Burgers and Sweet Potato Fries. You definitely need to hook yourself up with a Cheesecake before you leave, the Oreo Dream and Godiva are to die for but also very, very rich.

855,D S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,95,,2.0,2014-09-26,"Hard to be positive about Cheesecake.  The things that I used to enjoy or at least accept just aren't that acceptable anymore: 1) The bathroom's are very small.  This is ordinarily a small part of a restaurant experience, but consider the following: a large portion of the people at the Grove are families with small children.  Just go ahead and try washing your child's hands at the single sink in the men's room which they can't reach from the ground, so you have to hoist them up onto the counter.   But wait!   The counter is sopping wet.  So you have to spend a few seconds grabbing handfuls of paper towels to dry it off, or your child will have a wet bottom and things will really go downhill.  So you dry it off, only now the line of men waiting for the sink is growing by the minute.   So I madly try to wash my child's hands, but the only way to do this is one hand at a time, which basically doubles the time it takes.  The line grows longer, with silent looks of annoyance.  So you do the best job you can, a little hurried, but whatever, its ok, kids have dirty hands all the time, right? 2) The restaurant aisles are pretty narrow.  You live in constant fear that a waiter carrying 4 plates of steaming pasta is going to spill it all over your child in the high chair. 3) The food isn't that great.  The menu has about 400 items on it - common sense would dictate that no one can cook 400 items well.  So what you end up with are a bunch of pastas, salads, or deep fried items that are all pretty mediocre.  The only positive here is that the portions are large enough to give an elephant a heart attack.  So you'll have leftovers to feed your child the next day while you try and recover from eating at Cheesecake.  When I was younger I used to like this - but now, I really don't need all the extra mediocre calories. The bottom line - there is no reason to dine here, when the Farmer's Market is right around the corner, is cheaper, and just as noisy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=680,3.32,3.41,3.48,2.408,3.374

I ordered the macaroni burger both simple items came out 30 mins later just SLOW! My friends nachos were all wrong the movies probably could've provided better presentation for these nachos and on top of it all the added some sauce when we specifically asked for only meat and cheese!

We had a party of 12. After almost 2hours of waiting we asked the host if our table was ready. They said we still needed a while. We said how long and they told us 3 more hours. We felt like they just wanted us to leave. After speaking to the manager saying we already had been waiting there 2 hours she said their was nothing she could do for us. It was first of all not out fault that the 2 host in the front said it was a 45 to an hour wait. Or else we would have never waited to begin with. The host said she mistakingly meant 4-5 hour wait. Which no one in their right mind would stay. The manager didn't offer us anything or offered us splitting tables. She could care less. We even over heard her saying to the host that she backed them up. In my opinion the customer was right because they were the ones with the mistake. My family was so disappointed at their first time at the grove and first time at Cheesecake Factory that to be honest we felt the manager was a bit racist and unprofessional.

We were told it would take an hour and a half to two hours to be seated but received a text message about an hour and fifteen minutes later that our table was ready. Took us maybe seven minutes to get there and we were told to wait to be seated. After twenty minutes I complained asking why we were contacted that our table was ready and after hearing from the hostess we took too long to get back, etc. we were seated on the outside patio which was not very good for me and my cold especially given that night was so cold. We ordered the artichokes to start and when we received them they were dry and had no meat. I let the waiter (Jesse) know and he said he would get another one. This is when Patrick, the manager, came to our table and apologized for the artichoke and asked if everything else was okay since it appeared it had been visible to Jesse I wasn't happy from the beginning. Patrick sat down with us, I explained the wait for the table, he apologized, offered to move us inside and was so beyond pleasant that I got over the wait, cold, and artichoke. The artichoke was replaced, it was perfect and both Jessie and Patrick gave us the best attention and service the rest of the night. Patrick stopped by our table again and even offered me a scarf! We enjoyed a delicious dinner and dessert which is what I think is always a guarantee at the Cheesecake Factory and had a very good rest of the evening. When the check came, the artichoke was completely comped even though the replacement was perfect. My mom and I were so impressed by Patrick and his attitude, he's a true reflection of what a manager should be. And Jesse was an amazing waiter!

No need to feel frustrated with that familiar experience patrons dislike: "" where is the waiter/ waitress?""  Bartenders are customer service friendly.  We had no complaints.  Sometimes it is possible to walk in and make for the stairs straight to the bar yourself.  Sometimes the host will say the bar seats are filled.

At those times it can sound loud with all the surrounding talk.  It is to be expected. Worth repeated visits. Their bakery has take outs. They have a busy line there.

When I pressed them asking why we hadn't received a text, they rudely said ""we tried texting you but no one came up"".  Such a blatant lie as there were zero texts received. And how shady is it to try and blame the customer? I would have pushed it further, but we were with out of town guests and I didn't want to make them uncomfortable. Their unwillingness to admit the mistake and own up to it left me more than a little irritated. The meal itself was ok. Our main waitress was very nice and came by frequently to check on us.

632,Jennifer S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,29,4.0,1.0,2015-04-08,"Had the worst experience at this Cheesecake Factory.  First, we were overwhelmed by the strong smell of patchouli oil that one of the staff was wearing.  It was so bad, my friend told the manager about it.  The manager was apologetic and said she would say something to the employee.   We ordered our food - our waiter was great. Very nice and personable.  He walked away to put in our order. Suddenly, a woman and her young child are rushing towards our table - the woman has a napkin over the girls mouth, and the girl is vomiting into the napkin and on the floor.  A waitress points the woman in the direction of the bathroom and proceeds to cover the vomit on the floor with a few napkins.  Other wait staff did the same thing with the vomit path leading to the bathroom.   My friend and I watched as the wait staff walked over and slipped on these napkins, for almost 10 minutes. Finally, my friend tells one of them that they should probably clean it up properly before someone slips and falls.  Someone brought out a swiffer type dry mop and cleaned it up without soap and water. Not very sanitary for a place that serves food.  We received our food - teriyaki chicken and a turkey burger.  The chicken was ok, but the rice was under cooked and hard.  The turkey burger was bland and dry.  We didn't want to send any food back because at this point, we just wanted to get out of there.  Safe to say, I will not be going back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=580,3.08,3.19,3.372,2.8520000000000003,3.146

We were told if we wanted a table like that we would have to sit at 2 different tables. At that point I decided to go have a look around. As I stroll through the restaurant checking out the scene I see a whole section of tables wide open. So I say to the host hey  can we sit here. Long story short after being told no we can't. They ended up seating us there. That's the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5. Our whole party of 8 works in the industry and were up visiting from San Diego.

The burger was great, but if you're looking for something somewhat healthy go for something else. I felt like I gained 10 lbs after eating the BBQ burger. Probably didn't help that I had a side of ranch to dip my fries in.  The service was great. Our ice teas and water were filled without having to ask our waiter. We sat outside and it was a beautiful day.  I've also been here several other times. The fried calamari is a must try, as well as the eggplant Parmesan. During dinner time it gets very busy. I've waited as long as an hour before. The good thing is they will send you a text when the table is ready so you don't have to wait around. Go shop and come back when you get the text.

731,Bonnie W.,"Los Angeles, CA",96,45,22.0,4.0,2015-04-27,"We have been here about 6 or 7 times and I wouldn't slate the place, the place is lovely, well decorated, the staff are lovely, attentive and so forth. You expect a wait, and a longer wait for outdoors. Just accept that as it goes with the popularity of the place. We still like it here and will continue to return but there are some niggles and it's not always 100%....for one, they have an awful noise problem inside, one that I'm not even sure they are aware of. We sat inside on Sunday night and it was awful, we were almost shouting our conversation to each other, the racket caused by staff clattering knives and forks was deafening as was overall staff noise. It reminded me of a school canteen. The music was much lower on the decibel list than the staff and kitchen noises flooding out and even drowned out customer chatter. Not a pleasant noise. Especially not a nice noise To try and sip a nice Malbec in! There is a time issue too as we have twice still been eating starters when hot mains come out? Who wants to sit watching $30 of main courses go cold?....Also, I don't know why they feel that it's a nice idea to leave a gap of 4cm between tables for 2, it was ridiculous, we were a 2 but almost a forced table of 4, which was uncomfortable, but this shouldn't have to be pointed out, lastly the whole bill nonsense coming far earlier than you want it is just rude, annoying, interrupts conversations, puts pressure on the customers to leave and if they have a $40 near full bottle of red sat in front of them it's not nice. I feel sometimes that the real acid test is that the manager goes in the restaurant and sits like a customer and sees and hears and feels what they do, it's a test which I'm sure would always see changes. We received the bill without asking for it with a lot of wine left in our bottle and she brought the bill and said ,no rush sir, but there is, always is, as we continued to talk she came back and picked up the empty wallet, interrupting us again,we apologised saying we hadn't done it yet..... We stopped our conversation yet again at a point we hadn't planned, he ruffled through the wallet.... Just a rude interruption, there is clearly a rush, they hover around, watching for cards going in wallets, you feel uncomfortable, rushed and after paying we put some cash tip under a glass after getting our card back and we were interrupted again with a snatch of the cash and her saying 'I'll get that out of your way sir, .........it wasn't in our way? I can understand it when they need tables, both times there were many spare tables so it's just their practice I suppose. Saying all that, All the food seems to come out well, we especially love the Thai chicken wrap starter using lettuce leaves and triple Chinese style sauces. Most of the startrpers we have tried and we love, the small Greek salad is especially tasty. We really hated a dish of strawberry shortcake last week where a soggy super large biscuit was placed floating in red sugar syrup, served with equally marinated in sugar syrup strawberries with ok ice cream and a huge amount of cream to give it the ridiculous effect of a tower......not nice in so many ways,sickly, ridiculously too large and soggy and sugary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=480,3.48,3.2,3.372,2.7039999999999997,3.3120000000000007

Service was fine, not really stellar, they are busy and just trying to get through the line of people waiting to eat next. The menu is insane, way too much really, but usually everything that comes out is pretty good. One of the better chains when it comes to quality, prices are a bit higher, but portions are large and you can easily have left overs for later making the price justified.

The hit of the evening was our appetizer, the fried mac n cheese balls they were golden cheesy perfection. Service was a little slow but our waitress was fantastic, the place was popping so I'm patient. My only con is the small tables and dim lighting, which is great if they had enough room for a candle on the table, but they can barely fit plates, drinks, and free bread.

21,Chris L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,2015-06-07,"Attn: HQ Team Calabasas Where do I start with this beyond unsatisfactory performance and review?  First, a bit of history.  I have been a cheesecake factory customer for just about the beginning of time. I have spent countless birthdays, anniversaries, and special occasionss with family and friends. This includes multiple locations in Las Vegas (Caesar Shoppes) and Calfornia (The Grove, Americana, Sherman Oaks etc.). Although customer service has rarely been up to par, I have remained a loyal and devoted guest. Up until a recent visit @ their Grove location, I have decided to part ways and take my business to oher eating establishmens that will serve me or any other party as they should ""A guest."" I am not VIP or claim to be more special, but I was not aware I needed to be to receive the fundamental purpose of eating out which is to have an ""Experience"" and a great social gathering with great food amongst love one's and friends. The reviews before me are consistent, and definitely show insight as to how broken processes, operations, and talent management are.  It took 1 hour and 15 minutes to be checked in, 30 minutes after check in to be seated, 20 minutes to get a waiter (rude, bad demeanor), 20 mins to get our drinks, an interval of 45 mins to order,  and I can go on. Beyond that, management requested my wife to move so ""Other guest could be more comfortable!"" Wait... I'm not a guest?  This was by far the worst experience to the point that we didn't finish our meals amd requested the check early. In closing, I feel trends and history are great tools to understand behaviors, and can be utilized to strategically implement efficiency measures. Please take it from a long time customer, there are far more better choices out there that will deliver a consistent experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=600,3.2,3.24,3.332,2.6920000000000006,3.2240000000000006

Basically it was empty.    Girl at front desk asks me the usual, ""how many?"", ""inside or outside?"", ""can I get your name?""... Then sends us up the escalator to the 2nd check in desk.  Again keep in mind no one is in the restaurant.  Also note: I asked to be seated outside balcony... More to come on this. Arrive at 2nd check in desk upstairs.  They ask me for my name.  I give it to them.  They check their computer to make sure I'm in the system.  I say ""they"" because it required multiple staff members to figure this out.  They look at the computer, then look back at me... ""andrew?"" (Well duh... Who else would I be? I just said my name... No one else is around... ) Someone new comes to take us to the table... And we follow... Only to arrive at a table inside... Not outside.  We told the staff that we specifically asked to sit outside.  The host looked confused and said they needed to go check at the counter to confirm the table.  (No clue why they can't just sit me at the table I want to sit at because the restaurant is literally empty except for one other party) Finally the host comes back to tell us they don't know what happened and we need to go back to the front counter to resolve the issue.  So, we walk back to the counter and the same staff members were still there.  Shit you not... They asked me for my name again.  I told them again that I specifically asked for a table outside on the balcony.  They confirm with the computer, all smiles, and tell me ""Right this way"".   Shit you not, they literally took me to the same table inside... Again.  So, I laughed, tell the host once again that this is not the table I requested and that I requested a table outside on the balcony.  Again.. Let me remind you that THERE IS NO ONE ELSE IN THE RESTAURANT.   So we are instructed to go back to the front desk to clear this up, again.  I know this sounds insane but it is all true, bear with me.   We arrive at the front desk and once again they ask me for my name.  Dear staff, my name is Andrew dammit.  3 people standing at the front desk this whole time and none of them could remember my name.  Anyways, they check the computer to confirm, again.  They still look confused.  So I tell them again, who I am, and that we are a party of 2, and we specifically asked for a table outside.  They seemed to have figured it out now and off we go. Just wait there is actually more.   We finally get outside and they showed me to our table.  This table was near the door, and since the restaurant was empty I saw no harm is asking to take a different table that was right against the middle section of the balcony.  Shit you not... The host literally said ""hold on I need to check to make sure that table is available"" and proceeds to call the front desk.  First of all... As all you Yelpers fully understand by now... The restaurant was f*cking empty lol.  2nd, I've tried making reservations at this location and they have explained to me they do not take reservations and therefore there is no possible way that the table we want is taken.

88,Greg A.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,19,,3.0,2015-08-23,"*ELEVATOR ISSUE*  This morning my wife and I took our 5-month old child to the Grove for brunch.  We used the elevator from the lobby because we had the baby in a stroller.  When the elevator reached the second floor it abruptly jolted, made a huge bang and dropped about 5-10 inches.  The elevator repeated this sequentially about 7 times.  It then got quiet for a second - I told my wife i thought we were stuck - and then the doors opened.  We were not injured, the baby was not hurt but it was scary (SERIOUSLY).  It frightened me enough that when I got off I couldn't control my laughter mostly because it really scared the crap out of me.  My wife was not amused.  For context: I've had the misfortune of being stuck in an immobilized elevator for about three hours in college and it didn't bother me one bit.  I am not claustrophobic and am generally a calm person.  Whatever this elevator was doing was no-joke scary.  My issue however; is not with the elevator - it is with the nature of which our reporting it was summarily dismissed as if it were not to be taken seriously.  I am no elevator expert but it could be a serious safety concern and it needs to be checked by a licensed elevator service repairman.  My wife reported it to the hostess who seated us.  To be fair, I was laughing becuase I was relieved that I didn't do a Final Destination into the ground floor but I, too, reiterated to the hostess that something was really wrong with the elevator and nobody should be using it until it gets checked.  The hostess was young and may have not fully grasped what we were relaying so we, again, reiterated to her that this was not funny and needed to be addressed.  She immediately acknowledged this and took it more seriously when we insisted we weren't joking and she began to report it to her manager (I think it was the manager) who just dismised her entirely and said something to the effect of, ""yeah I will check it just get these people seated.""  The manager's dismissal was wholly unprofessional for the following reasons:  1.  We were complaining to a hostess of probably 18 years old who was clearly not the person to handle this complaint and when she escalated it to her manager - the woman (a blonde in her mid to late 40's) did not say one word to us.  She was more worried about getting the brunch crowd seated than a potentially serious safety complaint.  At the time there was nobody else waiting.  She had time to address us and chose not to.  2. We had a baby in a stroller on the elevator.   Nobody said, ""hey we are sorry, let us check that out"".  It would have at least been small comfort that the next person wasn't going to get demolished by a broken elevator.  3. The manager could not have cared less and never asked us to specifically describe what happened.  Just usher us on to the table and back to work.  I did see the manager go get on the elevator, I think ride it down and back up.  She got off and that was that.  Never a question about specifically what went wrong, what was she looking for, etc... We sat for the next few minutes discussing how sad it would be if someone got seriously injured on the elevator because nobody was listening.  We relayed the information to the couple who joined us a few minutes later and eventually got on with our meal.  I'd like to make sure whoever reads this understands that my complaint is not with the hostess or the elevator problem itself - but with the casual dismissal that the manager gave in not caring the least about a potential safety issue.  Unless she is some kind of qualified elevator technician - her riding it up and down once hardly counts as checking it for a safety issue.  Please have someone that checks this kind of thing (probably have one that works for the Grove, it's a huge place) look into this ASAP. As an aside - about my dining experience: 1. My coffee was luke-warm when I got the first cup.  Whatever, it tasted fine, I drank it and usually finish a cup of coffee by the time it's reached room temperature anyway.  I do have my doubts as to whether or not it was made this morning.  It's been in a mug or pot overnight and was slightly warmer than tap water.  When it was refilled it was the proper temperature of a fresh cup of coffee.  This it NOT a complaint as I really don't mind, just an observation for Quality Control. 2. When seated my table was greasy with butter streaks.  It's not likely someone already had a meal since this location only opens 25 minutes before we were seated so whoever wiped the table down did not go a good job.  I had to use my napkin to wipe off the butter streaks.  It was clear someone with a seriously dirty table cloth had wiped it off but was still super gross to set my arms in butter streaks.  This was the only uncool part of my actual dining experience. I did not complain to anyone about this and wiped it up myself - also not a huge deal as I am not a little baby. 3.  Our waiter was great.  A young guy, super cool.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=740,3.12,3.23,3.292,2.9880000000000004,3.186

9,Veronica H.,"Atlanta, GA",0,10,,1.0,2015-10-14,"I've frequented several Cheesecake Factory restaurants from various locations in and out of the state.  Typically, the food and service is good.  However, my family was in town and we were meeting family at the CF at the Grove, where we had never been, since I am fairly new in town.  Beautiful facility.  However, the service was less than average. They took forever to seat us and refused to sit us outside as we requested because as they told us we had a party of seven and it was a fire hazard to connect the tables.  We looked out and saw several tables that were close enough together in the same vicinity that still would have worked, but yet they continued to fight this.  Fortunately, a server came out, after close to 30 minutes of sending us back and forth, and told us it would be okay to sit there. She then actually pulled our tables together.  Another server came out to take our order.  He was nice.  It appeared that everyone ordered their food successfully..except me.  I was feeling under the weather and had a migraine, so I simply ordered a Chicken Caesar salad.  The salad came out soggy like it had been sitting for a while somewhere.  The dressing on it did not taste like a typical Caesar salad dressing.  It was also very bland and quite off putting and there wasn't much on the salad,  The chicken was definitely flavorless.  I eventually told another server who replaced the original guy I placed the order with.  He took it back and brought out another supposedly fresh salad.  At this point, everyone else had finished their food, so I asked for a to-go-box.  Initially, the lettuce appeared to be fresher and crisper than before.  Therefore, I took everything to go before eating again.  However, the chicken was rubbery, hard, and flavorless.  The dressing was lifeless and he only gave me one small container full, so it basically was only enough to cover a few top pieces of lettuce.  Also, the croutons were stale. Wow!!!  $17.99 for this salad?  Very disappointing!!!!  And really....How in the world can any restaurant mess up a simple Caesar salad?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=560,3.52,3.28,3.304,2.6280000000000006,3.3760000000000003

However, it does not constitute their rude behavior and unwarranted comments. The other Yelp reviewers were right when they said that the service was bad. I've withheld the waiters' names to protect their rights. Waiter 1 - Everything was going okay in the beginning and he even took our group photos (not well, unfortunately). Then he wrote down our orders: 1 Da Vinci Pasta, 1 Chicken Scampi, 3 Chicken Madeira, and 1 Bang Bang Chicken. He repeated the order and we thought we were good. Twenty to 30 minutes later, our order arrives, but instead of 3 Madeiras, 2 other waiters bring in 3 Chicken Scampis. We tell them that we only ordered 1 Chicken Scampi.  The waiters go back and probably caused a commotion because Waiter 1 comes over shortly and says aloud, ""Next time, be careful with what you order"", trying to take the blame away from himself and putting it on us. Remember, the guy repeated the order before he left, but he tells us that we got it wrong?  He quickly leaves before we could say anything--we were shocked.  The manager must have gotten word and came over to apologize about the mistake on our order. We told her what rude Waiter 1 said and we confirmed it was only him, and not the other waitress who also attended to us (but more on her later). The manager offered two soups on the house. This lady, unlike her waiters, has good PR and customer service. She alone deserves a star. Waiter 2 - She was the waiter who tended to us for the remainder of the evening. We thought everything was going smoothly, but we were mistaken. One of us in our party had spoken with this waitress early on to let them know that we had 2 birthday celebrants. When it was time for dessert, our friend asked Waiter 2 if she remembered what they spoke about and if they had some kind of birthday treat (which they've done in the past, along with singing 'Happy Birthday'; they even did it that same night for a different table). Waiter 2 says with an attitude that came out of no where: ""We don't offer free cheesecakes; if we did, everyone would be coming here"".  First of all, our friend didn't ask for a free cheesecake. She was trying to help you recall your earlier conversation. Secondly, you are in the customer service industry--what is up with the attitude and why? It seems that Waiter 2, for reasons known only to her, mistook what our friend said. Waiter 2 continues to ask if whether we'd like to order dessert, gives us some time, and leaves to pack up our leftovers. When she came back, we declined in ordering desserts and instead asked for the bill. Did we leave a tip? No way. Would anyone in their right mind leave a tip after being insulted? Twice? No, and no thanks.  We won't be coming back to this Cheesecake Factory located at The Grove. There's a long wait (they don't take reservations), they have rude and untrained waiters, and bad lighting. The only good thing was the manager. Someone give her a raise! With that said, we don't want any of the waiters to be fired from their jobs; we simply want to let it be known that their attitude and behavior was insulting and uncalled for.  After this bad experience, we brought our party to Marmalade Cafe at the Farmer's Market side for dessert. We were met with kindness and great, quality service. Cheesecake Factory, head over to the Marmalade Cafe and you guys might learn a thing or two.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=420,3.44,3.28,3.292,2.7560000000000002,3.3440000000000003

At the end the waiter began to loosen up and made us feel a little more at home. With that, we went ahead and tried some of his suggested cheesecakes. I wasn't disappointed with my choice.

First of all, there was a ridiculously long wait (more than a 2 hour wait) for a table, so I decided to just ask them if me and my friend can order takeout instead. Even thought they were jam packed, they were kind enough to let us in and order upstairs. When we got there, the display of cheesecakes was unimaginable. It was like walking into a bakery filled with your favorite cakes (mine being cheesecake). We were going to order, but we decided to try to ask if there were any bar seatings open. To our surprise, they told us that it was open seating and we were free to grab any open seat. We were shocked when we walked over and found two open seats!!! It was too great, bypassing maybe about 30 parties and getting to sit down at the bar and order. The ambiance is absolutely terrific. Though slightly dark, it highlights the collection of liquor at the bar, along with the Christmas lighting outside on the main street (if you come during the holiday season). If you want to save room for dessert, I would recommend just ordering appetizers, which in my opinion, are better than their main courses. I got the loaded baked tater tots and buffalo chicken wings. The chicken wings were average, wasn't bad, but didn't stand out. However, their loaded baked tater tots were out of this world. Perfectly fried tater tots with cheese, bacon, and green onions, with sour cream to dip on the side. Oh man it couldn't have been anymore perfect. Once you bite past the perfectly fried outer layer, the inside just melts in your mouth and you taste a creamy combination of cheese, potato, bacon, and green onions. And this appetizer is only $6 for about 10 of them. Definitely worth getting it.  As for the desert, I tried the tuxedo cheesecake, recommended to me by my friend. And boy it did not disappoint. If you love chocolate, or anything sweet, get ready to taste chocolate on top of cheesecake on top of chocolate on top of more chocolate. Comprised of their fudge cake, chocolate cheesecake, mousse, and more chocolate, this cheesecake makes you feel like your mouth is swimming in chocolate (along with the two giant creamy, delicious mounds of whipped cream they top it with).  This experience here couldn't have been any better. To those with a party of 2 or 3, try the bar if the restaurant is too crowded. If not, it's still definitely worth the experience, especially if you can get a seat outside on their beautiful balcony overlooking the Grove's heavily decorated and beautiful main street.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=300,3.04,3.24,3.24,3.2520000000000002,3.1600000000000006

Luckily for me, I was very much drawn to the ""Skinnylicious"" menu, thus I only had to read two pages of menu items... That being said, I still struggled to pick what I wanted... The chicken lettuce tacos or the large salad with salmon... I went with the latter because when do I ever crave chicken over salmon?  My dining companion got some chicken dish, the first menu item on page 11, without the mushroom sauce... But for starters, he got a slice of STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE. Clearly he's living the YOLO LIFE.

I have been to MANY Cheesecake Factory restaurants MANY times (including the grove location.)  Last night our food was not AND service was not up to their usual standard. The service was SLOW. It was 40 minutes from when we ordered to when we received our food.  We ordered appetizers and they arrived AFTER our meals arrived and remember, the meals themselves took 40 minutes. They explained that there was a shift change which I'd allow some give but this was not acceptable. The manager was nice enough and the waiter tried to smooth it over (I even gave him the full 20% tip, since it's Christmas) but, our dinner was just not that enjoyable. Even the food seemed kinda lame. There wasn't enough sauce for my dish and the food just generally didn't seem very fresh. And now the next morning I'm feeling kinda queasy from it all.

The waiter held a tray full of drinks, including coffee, virgin daquiries, lemonade, and water, over my daughters head.  When she moved in her chair, he spilled the contents of the tray all over my child and into my purse and coat and me.  We were soaked.  My daughter was crying and sticky.  The waiter did not get a manager (the restaurant was so busy that it was hard to get any help). Instead he refused to even assist me with drying my coat and purse, and told me that there was nothing he could do about it.  He brought towels and wiped up the floor.  My daughter was a wet wreck.  She was sticky and her spirits were soured.  Despite the fact that my purse was swimming with water with the contents ruined, I attempted to bring up the mood so as to help my daughter forget the unpleasantness.  At the end of the meal... no one was around to help.  I tried to wave down assistance for 20 minutes... the evening was getting late.  I got up to leave with my family when finally a check was brought to me.  They not only charged me for everything, there were even additional drinks added to the list that were not ordered. I was in a hurry to leave, and I didn't want to get my daughter upset by arguing, so I quickly paid the check and even added the standard gratuity. When I called the next day regarding what happened so that my dry cleaning would be covered, they kept me on hold for 15 minutes before some manager named Cindy said ""that's not what my waiter told me""  and that ""no one heard a child cry"" and that ""you could have called a manager"" Avoid this place. The staff are only superficially nice, but deep down they hate their customers Who would pour a tray of drinks on people and then not pick up their dry cleaning bills.

She is only one and loved it. My friend and I shared the vegan Cobb salad and a pasta. I enjoyed the Vegan Cobb. It had fruit on it but I thought that was slightly strange but the quinoa addition was very nice. We ordered Santa Fe Egg Rolls also, if you have these make sure you use the dipping sauce and eat some rice noodles which are really a garnish but we enjoyed.

They have a tall escalator to take you to the seating area, and they have booths by glass windows that give you a great view of the Grove. I saw them, but unfortunately we didn't get seated there. The food was tasty, I got the Crispy Shrimp Sandwich which was good. The portions are large as well.

Sat at the bar, service was fine. Ordered a burger MEDIUM WELL and fries. Fries were over cooked, burger was under cooked. As soon as I cut into it it created a greasy bloody puddle and made the bun soggy. I had to cut the 2 halves in half so I could eat around the edges that weren't red.

HUGE mistake ordering from here as this place is in the Grove.. which basically equals super packed and full of tourists. When I got back to my apartment, I noticed my food was barely lukewarm and watery. The dish barely had a taste (and the little taste it did have.. was pretty funky) and did not taste ANYTHING like the other times I've gotten the Pasta Da Vinci. There was also pieces of pasta that did not belong. The dish comes with penne, but there were random pieces of farfalle and other types of pasta. I also found a couple pieces of sausage that obviously should not be there.... since this dish does not come with sausages... makes me wonder how they cook the food...

Why the heck do they have two check in stations that seem to operate separately?! When you walk in the door downstairs, you check in at the host stand. They tell you when you can go upstairs, presumably because your table is ready and someone will seat you upstairs. Well, tough luck. We went upstairs as instructed, no one helped us or greeted us upstairs so we walked around til we found a waiter and asked if we could just grab a table, since there were plenty at this hour. He told us to go back to the host stand, where the hostess was more interested in gossiping with her friend than she was in providing customer service. She made sure she finished her conversation before she attended to my party and the other parties waiting, with lots of attitude, mind you. Outrageous. I just don't understand what the point of checking in downstairs is if you have to check in again upstairs. Like logically, for crowd control purposes, you should check in downstairs, and then have the party go upstairs when someone upstairs is ready to seat you. Seamless process right? THe way they have it set up, upstairs is a total fire hazard. You have people waiting to be seated, and probably confused why no one is helping them. You have people oogling at the cheesecake displays. And you have people trying to exit the restaurant too.

I didn't like the hostesses downstairs. I patiently waited in line to put my name down on the list. People behind me in line stepped to the left and right of me, to be taken by the next hostess and have their name put down. At least 3 groups cut in front of me. Until I finally interrupted all the stimulation that seemed to be distracting the hostesses (the natural atmosphere of Cheesecake Factory) and said ""HEY! Aren't I next in line?"" She said, ""...yes."" And could not understand my firm statement. I said, if you see someone next in line, call them over. Don't just take the next person who walks up. Obvious a line had formed. Be fair to those waiting. I can be pushy too and cut the line, but don't think you hostesses would want people crowded around the counter in a disorganized fashion.  One hostess (young black girl with braids) was one I had contact with. She was unaware of what was happening. She apologized and put my name down, and apologized one other time later. I appreciate this, but please, take more notice of those who are patiently waiting to receive a pager. Just because I came in alone, does not mean I am not important, because that's how I felt... On a side note, I found a place at the bar, and my server was Kennedy. Gosh is she awesome. She was attentive and sincere in the way she engaged with you in conversation. She patiently answered ALLLL my menu questions and was knowledgeable about everything. I would go back to Cheesecake just because of her. Servers should emulate the style that Kennedy puts out there. She is kind, caters to your needs and is helpful. She offered to box my food for me, which many Cheesecake servers don't do. She checked on me enough.

My husband is a Buffalo Wing aficionado. I took some back home to San Diego, because there were way too many for me to eat. They are the best he has ever had. It eliminates the bones. There is lots of crunch and the flavor is seriously amazing. I am giving it a lesser star, because the hosts clearly put their emphasis on the tourists and ""name brand"" folks. I literally had to say hello to them before they acknowledged my presence (after 2 minutes), which I found humorous. I was dressed extremely casual. I looked very unassuming - possible frugal. However, I am a ""More Than 20% Tipper"" for quality service. Positive Note: Tarin was my server. She was extremely patient and focused on making me happy - from the moment she said hello. She did not concern herself with my appearance, which was due to me spending 5 days in Cedar Sinai Hospital, nursing my son, who is in need of his second heart transplant. So, because of her, the generous cocktail, and the fabulous food, I will definitely go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=100,3.16,3.31,3.264,3.216,3.25

462,Aryo S.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",420,233,778.0,4.0,2016-11-29,"---Atmosphere, Service, Parking---- Located at The Grove you can expect this to be a busy place. With the same look and feel of other locations elsewhere, it's a great setting with a couple differences. They do have a patio with what I suspect to be a nice view. When you enter there's a host stand with several hosts, and they'll take your name down and present you with a pager (if you have to wait). The cool thing is that the pager allows you to walk to a certain distance, so ask about how far it reaches the surrounding area. Once entering you'll head up a set of stairs or escalators and then you need to talk to another set of hosts who then ultimately seat you. Nearby is a display with desserts and dressings for sale.  Service was pretty great by newcomer(at the time) Asia when I visited last and besides one bump in the road with hosts prior to sitting down, everything else went well.  The Grove has parking and it's in a large parking structure. Make to sure to ask about validation as they validate an hour here (first at The Grove is free).  --Food, Drinks & Prices--- I'm sure you know what they provide here and at the many other locations; the menu is vast with all sorts of things. Many appetizers, small plates, pasta dishes, pizzas, burgers and sandwiches, soups and salads, tacos, chicken and steak dishes, seafood, and all other sorts of entrees, ranging and hitting many flavors of different cuisines. Portions are large and same with the calories in everything (don't look!). Love the fresh bread and butter they serve first. I've pretty much loved everything I've had at the Factory over the years, can't go wrong with anything really. Here's a few things I've tried: -Avocado Eggrolls - Avocado lovers unite! Tons of it obviously with a couple other ingredients mixed in served with a tamarind dipping sauce. -Tex-Mex Eggrolls - Crispy rolls filled w/spicy chicken, corn, black beans, peppers, onions and melted cheese. Served with avocado cream and a pica de gallo. -Buffalo Bites - Lots of breading on this thing but for those who love buffalo sauce these are filled with chicken, cheese and wing sauce. -Crab Cakes - Three of them I believe and pretty tasty. -Meatballs with ricotta and garlic bread - Great meatballs and sauce, served with great bread for dipping -Chicken Scampi Pasta - All the great flavors of a scampi, delicious. -Steak Diane - Medallions of certified angus beef steak covered with black peppercorns and a rich mushroom wine sauce. Served with mashed potatoes and grilled onions. Great! -Pumpkin Cheesecake - If you like pumpkin pie you'll adore this just the same. All sorts of drinks and a full bar is available. Something to note is that The Factory has it's own line of wine, I believe beer as well (I may be wrong on that). Prices are in the $5-20ish range.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=140,3.48,3.3,3.288,2.8320000000000003,3.3720000000000003

Two more salads came out without meat on them, and because the person who filled my bags assured me they were made correctly, I didn't notice until I had walked back over with our food.  I could understand checking food to make sure it has no cheese on it, etc. as part of a specification, and I'm also not the type to leave bad reviews, but this is really unacceptable and reflects badly on me as an employee when my execs notice something's wrong.

They were busy, and our waitress had multiple tables and I could tell she was doing her best, but we did not leave until 3:04p because everything took forever.  We just wanted to pay because our Gumbo was just plain nasty (this time, normally it is to die for), but that still took 30 minutes. The people serving us tried their best but they were clearly short staffed, and we always thank the great state of California for giving 18-22 year old millennials the option to go to work or simply call in and be paid (pretty sure if they had it when I was growing up I would us every hour I had lol).

I ordered the two mojitos, buffalo blasts and garlic noodles with shrimp. Hubby ordered a strawberry milkshake, fried Mac n cheese and fettuccine Alfredo. The bill was $155 and it kind of shocked me. I was thinking maybe $100 but $155 for the quality and portions we received def was not worth it.  Our waitress was clearly over booked. Anytime you have to flag down a busboy cleaning another table to ask for a refill on your water that's a problem! The only real Pros were the two mojitos. They were delicious and since I hit the skinny version they were under 150 cals!  Doubt we'll be visiting anytime soon.

I ordered the bang shrimp and Cuban egg roll appetizers. The family said it was greasy, the egg rolls but it was ok and the shrimp was good but not a speck of spicy heat but it was good. We also ordered Madera chicken, everything pizza lunch, and Louisiana chicken pasta. The pizza was good. Crispy crust good toppings but it's pizza, even bad pizza is good pizza. The chicken Madera was slightly dry and needed some seasonings but the potatoes and sauce were delicious. Lots of mushrooms. The Louisiana pasta was a bit disappointing. The sauce was thin so it didn't really coat the pasta and the veggies were more like a garnish then part of the dish. It was like crispy chicken and bow tie pasta noodles with veggie garnish. Sad. But, what you really come here for, cheesecake, we ordered strawberry and Apple cheesecake. Both were excellent. Totally worth ordering. We actually enjoyed the strawberry a bit more than the applewhich is surprising for us. The apple had less cheesecake and more filler.

We got there and the wait was thirty minutes but it felt like we were seated a bit sooner (which was nice) they say us outside near the edge squashed up next to a bigger party. They do have heaters but where they sat us the heaters did not reach...mind you this was at night so it was freezing! Most places would let you know ahead of time or ask if it's fine that you'd be outside. Nope! They assumed since we were young that we weren't going to spend much so we essentially didn't matter(we felt pretty judged) but they sat us inside and our server finally came. He spoke very low so it was hard to hear and we continuously asked him to repeat what he said. We knew what we wanted when he asked for our drinks so our orders were placed quickly. A couple next to us we're seated at the same time. This was an older and more rich looking couple...not only did they get their drinks, bread and butter before us but they also got their meal before us even though it was put in after us. We asked a few times what was taking so long and he just stared confused. Once the couple finished their food, paid, and another couple came, got their orders taken and served!!! We were served. I was so mad and so hungry. Ps my boyfriend got a burger and fries while I was served cold mashed potatoes and chicken. WORST SERVICE EVER!

(FYI; Had the same dish in Beverly Hills earlier this week, and it was delicious). Sent it back again but this time I didn't wanna take a chance on the same dish, so I got an alternative dish which came out decent. Service wise it sucked. The manager did replace the dish, but it was in a very mechanical way. No apologies, just didn't seem to give a damn. I mean; It's not that I think he should be on his knees,  but at least gave the courtesy to pretend like you care- Specially since you're the manager. The bartender was lagging like crazy when it came to pouring wine, and we had empty glasses for a loooong time. Finally ended up moving to the place next door, where we were taken care of.

281,Brandon N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,2017-02-20,"3 Words: Biggest Disappointment Ever. My friends and I went to cheesecake factory thinking we could get some of the ""world's best cheesecake"" as a part of a suprise birthday celebration for one friend in our group who visited from another country. As we finally found a seat to settle for a party of six, we asked the waiter for a 6 inch whole cheesecake and found out that it would take over an hour after request. (Which is a huge delay!) He then gave us time to decide if we would want to make that purchase and decided we would wait, however once he came back, he told us that we may or may not be guaranteed the cheesecake after the 1 hour wait. Because of that, we decided to leave due to the extreme disappointment that this restaurant brought us. First of all, the Cheesecake factory should always have a whole cheesecake ready to go, having every single one frozen is completely ridiculous and only shows how unprepared the restaurant is to take on the demands of its customers. It's called the cheesecake factory for a reason is it not? So how about you stop freezing the cheesecakes during open hours where some customers might want to eat it then and there. Even Marie Callanders has their pies ready to eat upon request for God sakes. Even Vons has whole cheesecakes ready to eat!! The fact that Cheesecake Factory of all places would have all their world famous whole cheesecakes frozen 24/7 is insane! Ready to eat whole cheesecakes should be available upon request!! It's not even debatable for a restaurant looking to satisfy all customers. And for this, they will forever lose a customer. Also, the fact that our cheesecake was ""not guaranteed"" according to the waiter was also completely absurd. The customer should always be placed as a priority and tonight, our group did not recieve the treatment of customer priority.    If I could rate 0/5 stars I would. Cheesecake factory really let us down, and it was embarrassing for us not to have had a whole cheesecake ready for a suprise birthday celebration.

Secondly, the food came out and it was terrible. The omelette was over cooked and my salad had no taste. The lunch salad at Wendy's had more flavor than the one served.  After the food came our sever Nicolle S. neglected to come by to see if we were happy with our food. At that point we had been there for over an hour and I wasn't willing to spend more time there to send the food back and order a different dish. As a result of getting bad service and terrible food I paid my bill and left zero tip (I've only done this one other time in my entire life). That's how bad the service and quality was.

I called the restaurant for any reparations, and they told me that I needed to contact Door Dash for refunds. Fine, I'll accept my financial reparations from Door Dash, but I still hold the restaurant responsible because making the food properly is YOUR responsibility.  I'm sure people who have ordered delivery can understand the amplified frustration when food doesn't arrive correctly. We wait almost an hour for the food, and when it finally comes... it's not what we ordered. Plus, there's rarely anything we can do to correct the mistake immediately.

Santa Monica, Sherman Oaks, Beverly Hills, Glendale .. etc. And honestly I've never had bad service like this one.  First when we entered we were not greeted nicely, the 2 people up front were not friendly at all and not presentable either. We were ""greeted"" by a girl named Michelle, tattoos all over her, I mean nothing against that if you have a nice friendly attitude to balance it out but when you're mean looking and you're actually mean .. that art work does not help you at all. She asked how many people, i immediately felt a little rushed and just intimidated by her tone so I quickly responded with 2 she answered back with ""its going to be 15 min"" .. then I quickly said I'm sorry I meant to say 2 adults and a baby, she rolled her eyes and said ""THATS 3 people it's going to be 20 minutes"" I said ok that's fine, is it faster if we seat out door, she responds with ""thats an additional 15"" all with an attitude and a rude tone. Whatever .. we decided to stay and wait Bc it wasn't busy and wait wasn't long, any other day I would've probably not tolerated that kind of attitude specially as a good customer who goes to cheesecake on a weekly basis literally. So we get called to get seated, we get an outside table????? But did she not say it was going to be an additional 15? Okay well, we get seated around 5pm, ordered our drinks and food, didn't get our appetizer til almost 45 min later, our main entree we did not get until an hour later ??? Looking around and ppl who were seated after us received their food before us ? To top it off My food wasn't great at all, I get the same thing every time, the chicken pieces were super small, the sauce was watery with no flavor and my food was warm almost cold. Then right after the waitress serves our food, not even taking the first bite, she brings out the check???? Really guys? Idk but I'm so disappointed. Not happy. Not satisfied.

I ordered Hibachi Steak Med-rare and got med- well.  Also the mashed potatoes were cold. Lack of Presentation. Typical and upsetting. For paying over $20+ I personally think I would of enjoyed a double whopper from burger king more than I did here. Never Again will I make the same mistake. Another thing is sanitation.

I went to cheesecake with my bf and his mom. All three of us got pasta. My bf and I ordered the jambalaya and for one of them we asked for EXTRA sauce on the side. I repeated this to our server and he even confirmed it. HOWEVER, when it came out they did not put any sauce on it!!! AND no sauce on the side either...ummm...so you expect me to eat a tasteless jambalaya? I would understand if they at least gave me sauce on the side so I know where the miscommunication was but they put no sauce on the jambalaya AND no sauce on the side, just plain noodles. The jambalaya sauce took a very long time to come out, maybe around 20 minutes. By the time the sauce came out my bf and his mom were done eating. To top that off, my noodles had become cold! Ohmygosh...I'm a pretty understanding and patient person but this is unacceptable! As I was eating my cold jambalaya, my bf and his mom were watching me eating because they were already done...awkward. Even after this HUGE mistake, they did not offer any discounts. I'm not one to ask for discounts but the gesture tells you that they really are apologetic. All we got is a 'sorry' and nothing else. I used to work at a restaurant too and if something like this happened, I would go to the manager and explain what happened and see if I can do anything to make it up. Super disappointed! Especially since Cheesecake Factory is a huge chain restaurant.  I have more bad experiences at cheesecake but this review is already super long.

Another one of my favorite things this restaurant provides is the Skinnylicious menu! I adore the Asian Chicken Lettuce Wraps - light and delicious! Another one of my favorites that you have to try if you haven't yet-- (not on the Skinnylicious menu) Mac n cheese balls! So great for a shareable appetizer!

Once our buzzer was rang, we were instructed to go to the restaurant upstairs and check in at the left.

I wasn't mad, just not full!  The $10.95 antioxidant salad itself is mostly leaves and and broccoli. I think I counted three pieces of avocado and very little of anything else that was advertised on the menu (pears, grapes, blueberries, etc). I left disappointed with this choice, unfortunately.  The rest of my party seemed satisfied: the club (first we were under the impression it came with fries but does not), classic burger, BBQ Ranch chicken salad and chicken Thai coconut lime chicken seemed to be great.

From my experience, I try a different dish during each visit and they've never disappointed. Not to mention, their cheesecake is incredible (10/10 would recommend the Red Velvet).  One thing about this location is it is always packed so you'll usually always end up waiting at least 15 minutes for a seat, and on top of that service tends to be a little slow (but they try their best). If you have a lot of time on your hands, and you're looking for a place to hang out with friends, this is the place to be, but if you're in a rush, I would definitely go with somewhere a little quicker.

When we first arrived, we waited easily forty five minutes for our buzzer to go off (we were told it would be less than twenty minutes). When we stood to be seated, we were told the table wasn't ready yet and they'd call us by name. When we FINALLY got seated after being there over an hour, we didn't see a waiter for almost thirty minutes. By the time he got there, we already knew what we wanted and asked for water please and then ordered the rest of our meal and dessert. The waiter was once again nowhere to be seen for yet another twenty minutes (so, to recap, we had been in the building almost two hours, seated for nearly an hour, and hadn't even seen a glass of water). He finally arrives with water and what we had ordered for dessert, without bringing out bread or our appetizers or our entree. We asked for the check early. We didn't touch dessert as we wanted our other food first, we finished both our waters with no refill for over forty minutes, and after yet another twenty minutes he brings out a basket of bread and a check. (My partner and I had started timing these rare visits as a betting game, it had gotten so bad.) It would be a while longer on our appetizer, he said. Could we wait another thirty minutes? At this point I could've laughed. We canceled the remainder of our order, paid for our cheesecake and left.  So, we had been seated nearly two hours before we got our bread basket. Nearly an hour before we got a glass of water and forty minutes for a refill. We had been in the building nearly three hours before being told we'd have to wait longer for even our appetizer. As we didn't want to be eating mediocre pasta when the sun came up, we had to leave early. I've worked in food service before. I've worked busy nights and have dealt with being understaffed, fussy customers, the lot. They were not understaffed, it wasn't particularly busy, and from what we could observe many tables in our section were barely ever checked on, many had finished drinks and long finished their bread or food and were simply waiting for someone to swing by.

The server took about 10 minutes to get to us and was a little unfriendly, fine by me at this point since we were starving and wanted something to eat. He got us our drinks and we asked him for some bread as we ordered our meals. This is the reason for the 2 star. I am not joking, but I set my timer on my phone to check and see how long it took for him to get us the bread. 20 minutes go by and no bread!!! We flagged down another server that was walking by and mentioned to her that we requested bread from our server but he never got it. She was nice enough and brought us the bread herself. At this point its been 7 more minutes when she finally got us the bread. We did see our server walk up and down to the table across from us and next to us with bread and drink refills. Finally, another 15 minutes after we got the bread we get our meals. We requested refills on the drinks and more bread (its 3 of us and we're starving) . As we started eating our Santa Fe chicken salads we both noticed there was NO chicken in any of the 2 salads. I order the lunch size and my husband ordered the full size, the menu clearly says ""marinated chicken"" so I was expecting some kind of marinated chicken. We have ordered this salad at other locations and have notices they add very little chicken, not to say none. By the time the server came back to check on us again, we were almost done with our meals, but when he did we mentioned to him the chicken issue and he did in fact apologize (that is why I did 2 stars even though the chicken is not his fault but he did apologize) he  offer to bring us some chicken on the side or change our meals.

I have a major allergy issue, and we visited back in March. I ordered and specifically told the server 3 times to make the proper changes. I always get the same thing at other locations and they can accommodate. This server tried to have me to try something else instead, then went and checked with the back and came back to confirm they can do it. The food server (different person) even repeated the food order and the customization to me. After eating it, I started feeling ill. I asked the server again about the custom food and he said that's what you ordered. After a couple of more bites, I realized they were wrong and it was not customized. So the manager finally came over and confirmed it wasn't. He offered to pay for the meal of $40 which had no meaning for me and what I went thru that night. Thankfully it wasn't a hospital visit but still a painful night with no sleep. The manager even asked me for my name and number so he can check on me the next day. Guess what, no call. Probably thought I was a dine and dasher. I have been going to cheesecake since I was in my teens. Now it's just not something I will refer people to or go myself. I heard they are expanding, and we all know what can get lost during expansion; quality and service.

I ordered the almond crusted kale salad from the superfood section. At first I asked for dressing on the side then changed my mind and said just give me the salad as is. My friend ordered the same salad but instead of kale asked for mixed greens. Both of our salads arrive but look completely different aside from the greens. My salad was missing pretty much everything- dressing, avocado, quinoa and cranberries. I asked the waitress if this was how my salad was supposed to be because they looked very different. She told me she would take it back to the kitchen, 10 minutes late I get the corrected salad.

I wanted to visit a pop up shop at The Grove (first time at The Grove, shopping plazas and places where everyone wants to go all at once in general are not really my thing although I could be describing all of LA save for a few precious square feet) and my friend wanted to eat here. It was a 25 minute wait for a table of two and we considered and later regretted just not walking one block to the Farmer's Market at The Grove.  My first impression of this place is that it's ""like a theme park restaurant"" - and my friend pointed out how a line on the escalator to the second floor looked like people were in fact on a ride. Macaroni Grill is comparable food wise but just does such a much better job with food and ambience. After 25 minutes of waiting people ride the escalator to wait 10-15 more minutes.  The low ratings is primarily due to the drink menu coupled with the greasiness of the tables and floors. I felt like I was eating somewhere in Chinatown where at least it's remotely acceptable and part of the atmosphere. But the light brown tables really brought out the greasy look. Walking to the restroom was greasy. I was wearing mule flats with a reliable bottom tread and the floor was greasy enough to make the trip to the restroom a bit precarious in terms of slippage potential and felt my step slide at least twice. I hate greasy places. The ""blood orange margarita"" was a joke that went unfinished. Wrong taste, wrong glass. Avoid their cocktails at all costs and just go for draft beer or wine.  Their food was the only good thing - their infamous brown bread and butter. I had the jambalaya pasta and it was scientifically perfect. Their food undeniably has the taste of several food scientists sweating over recipes and testing them before putting it onto their ever changing menu. That's really the only interesting thing about this place. I compare it to McDonald's and use the same term: ""eatability."" The food has high eatability - you can eat a lot of their huge portions before being sated and even when sated want to eat just a bit more. It isn't necessarily the best food by all standards but boy is it so...eatable. And I don't mean edible...eatable foods are foods that create their own standard rather than adhere to traditional standards and emphasize the most base human cravings and turn those up a notch. The balance of color, of ingredients, of texture, of ease of transporting food from plate to mouth and the art of shape/portioning - it is all down to a measured science and I gotta say that in itself is pretty respectable and fascinating. Eatability is all about being too good to be authentic. That said, I probably will never come back even if there is a time and place for eatable foods.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3,2.92,2.73,2.976,2.6320000000000006,2.806
213,Tiffany W.,"La Puente, CA",0,8,1.0,3.0,2017-10-11,"I dined here this afternoon, arriving around 1:30. Right when I walked in the door, there was no one around but a woman behind a stand. I assumed she was the hostess so I went up to her but she was occupied looking at something behind her stand, so I politely waited for her to finish. After about a minute she finally looks up at me. She did not offer a greeting or ask if she could help me so at this point I thought that maybe she was not part of the restaurant but only worked in the building. I asked her if there was somewhere I could park my stroller and then moved upstairs via the escalator. At the top of an escalator I notice another stand identical to the one downstairs but this one had some people crowded around so I waited in line to put down my name for a table. When I got to the host, I told him ""table for two please!"" He stared at me blankly and asked if I had already given my name downstairs. I told him I did not then he frowned and said the wait would have to be about 5-10 minutes. I told him this was fine and moved to the side. My 2 year old daughter and I hung around looking at cheesecakes and about 15 min later they called our number. We returned to the host stand and returned the buzzer. The host told us that they were just cleaning off the table and would seat us shortly. I stepped to the side of the stand to wait to be seated. About another 10 minutes pass and I see several other parties called and also asked to stand to the side. I was pretty close to the stand that the host could have just turned around and told me there was some issue but he didnt. I waited another 5 minutes and went up to ask him if there was a problem. He told me that there was some confusion and that they were getting reorganized. The other two parties that were called and asked to wait were ignored. He could have told them both the same but he did not. Another few minutes pass and another hostess arrives to take us to our seats. As we are walking, she looks at my daughter and myself and asks if I would like a kids menu instead. I notice at this point that the male host who took our name down had handed her two standard menus. Since my daughter is only 2 I found this very strange. She went back and got the correct menu and we were finally seated. I ordered the kids spaghetti with meatballs for my kid and the grilled chicken avocado club for myself. The spaghetti was a large portion, more than she could ever eat, but tasted good. My sandwhich was a monster and impossible to eat without making a mess, but was also very tasty. Our server was a little difficult to find because the one who took our order and the one who checked up on us were not the same. I can only assume that the first one went on break and failed to inform us that the server would be changing.

The Cheesecake Factory is a great place for family/friends gatherings, celebrations, and dates.

Ambiance here is always on point, with decent service.  I have been coming here since the golden days, and it has not been long since I discovered their chicken and shrimp gumbo. Perhaps it's my favorite dish of all time here which I highly recommend. Their sauce is absolutely delicious, words cannot describe how awesome it tastes. Their chicken is tender, shrimp is gorgeous, and it all goes great with perfectly steamed white or brown rice. Their steak Diane, and BBQ ribs are also great alternatives depending on your mood. Their nachos are awesome too for sharing. Ask for ranch sauce so you can dip their wheat bread in it. Try not to finish it or you will be too full by the time the main dish arrives.

When our server, April, arrived we were lucky to get a smile out of her. We placed our drink orders and I ordered an alcoholic drink - you know being 30 and all. I got asked for ID, which is fine. I provided the server with my Australian drivers licence. She glanced at my licence asked if I had my passport on me, which I told her no. (As a traveller I never carry my passport on my person in case I lose it or something happens). She then told me she can't serve me any alcohol (I don't even think she looked at the ID properly). We tried to explain that our group had been served at the bar before being seated with the same ID's but she still wouldn't serve us. That was that.  We had also tried to order drinks at the bar after she had declined us service (as we had ordered there prior to being seated) but the server had told the bar staff to refuse us service.  The server came back shortly after and said she feels like she didn't explain herself properly before. She then gave a spiel about how it's company policy and she could lose her job (understandable) and that how every so often the staff of Cheesecake Factory come in and do training on international ID's/licenses (which I call bulls**t as she wouldn't serve us on a valid Australian Drivers Licence). Also, we have been to other Cheesecake Factory restaurants and we were served on the exact same ID's.  Now I understand that there is company policy and procedures and there are laws that need to be followed (being in law enforcement myself) but I feel that the way this was handled was very poor. Our group was extremely dissatisfied with the service provided at this particular store. Furthermore, some of the meals were poor quality.  Our group was not happy with the experience at the Cheesecake Factory at the Grove. The server (April) provided poor service from the moment she said hello to the end of our dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=40,2.88,2.88,2.96,1.8280000000000003,2.88

I called them days in advance AND the day off at 10am to let them know that a large party was coming for dinner that day. They didn't take reservations and they said to call back closer to the time to get a more accurate wait time. I called an hour and half before 6:30 pm (on my way to the grove) and I told them my party size and they said they couldn't give me an estimated wait time unless I was there in person. Still holding on to hope because I had never been here but love the grove for it's magical ambiance. I arrive to put my name down and they tell me it's a 3 HOUR WAIT! I was expecting at the most an hour and half (like everyone  else was being told). I KNEW this would happen which is why I called SO MANY times in advance to warn them a large party was coming but they didn't do anything to accommodate and make us wait even longer than everyone else... it absolutely spoiled my birthday filling me with both outrage and sadness because my entire party had travelled to get here only to be expected to wait to eat until 9:30pm.

First they brought the 3 herb crusted salmon, one of which was not fully cooked (I found out later after we left - if not I would have returned it), which my sister did not eat.   Then there was about 7 minutes gap and they brought the well done steak, and it had the ONIONS ... another 5 minutes goes by, and finally my medium well steak shows up, totally well done!  Eeks ...  The meat was not the prime meat that I had the pleasure of experincing in their other locations.  It was fatty, chewy and poorly cut (more like a stew meat than steak meat) and very poor presentation (stew of something) - NOT their usual appetizing and mouth watering display of food.   When I called to express my dissatisfaction, the answer was I am so sorry ... really?   The bigger they become the less quality they offer and they treat the patrons that they don't know the art of dining and the fact that a family eats together, not one person at a time.

A 2 hour wait is not great, but you have the rest of the mall to explore in that time. We were seated on the balcony with the theater lobby in view. It was a nice atmosphere but then I sat down and my feet were greeted with a wet syrupy floor. I look down and find that the entire floor has been neglected, cluttered with spills and stray food. Not something I want in any restaurant or my own home. A dirty restaurant is something I can't stand. The service is decent. The servers were very nice and food was served in about 10-20m of ordering. However, you can tell its a busy night when you notice that the pasta you ordered was slightly undercooked. It was also a little bit colder in temperature than you would want to eat it at. Then you would see under a light, the large smear that was meant to clean the edges of the plate. It should have been clean, but it was a clearly visible tomato smear.  As the table beside us finished eating and the clean up crew came around, I really hoped they would clean the floor. Unfortunately they didn't and it bothered me quite a bit. I wouldn't want to tell someone else to do their job when I'm a customer, so no words left my mouth.

Again, just horrible assistance when it came to be seated, we were rushed to our table and weren't even asked if we liked it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3,2.2,2.73,2.84,,2.5180000000000002
