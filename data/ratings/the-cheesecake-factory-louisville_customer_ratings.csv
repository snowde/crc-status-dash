85,Kelly S.,"Sterling Heights, MI",38,185,184.0,5.0,2012-01-12,"This Thanksgiving I took a little trip with my nephew from Detroit to Louisville, KY to Nashville, TN and back. On the way back we stopped for a bite to eat at The Cheesecake Factory. My 15 yr old nephew had never eaten at The Cheesecake Factory so I thought I'd let him experience the food/cheesecake. We decided to order 4 appetizers and afterwards he ordered a slice of strawberry cheesecake. Everything was awesome from the service, decor, coffee, food and cheesecake. The Chicken Pot Stickers, Chicken Sliders and Sweet Corn Fritters make me want to drive all the way back for more! The parking experience at this mall can be a pain so I was happy to utilize the valet parking outside of The Cheesecake Factory. The tasty little corn fritters were crispy, light, with just right amount of corn inside. Simply delicious! Also, the plain cheesecake with strawberry's on top was out of this world delicious. Smooth, thick, perfect taste and texture!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville?start=80,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000007

When the GF found this out about me, she gave me this look like I had just drowned a puppy while giggling like a school girl. But we got past that. We came here because she wanted breakfast, I wanted decidedly NOT breakfast, and we needed to eat near Trader Joe's. It worked. I ordered a burger, medium rare. And it actually came out medium rare. It was amazing. The fries were some of the best fries I've ever had. The GF's breakfast was also cooked to perfection.  Service was amazing. Glasses were never empty, food came quickly, and our waitress was really nice and funny.  I really had no intention of rating it this highly, but the experience was just so good that I had to. I would still prefer to check out a local restaurant, but I did not regret my time here in the slightest. Good place to come when out at the mall.

108,Shana K.,"Louisville, KY",232,425,509.0,4.0,2012-05-20,We stopped in for dinner on a weeknight to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday.  We were seated in a booth after a very short wait.  I ordered the four cheese pasta with chicken and he ordered the crusted chicken romano.  Both dishes were absolutely delicious.  We finished with the Godiva chocolate cheesecake.   My boyfriend is not a foodie and doensn't usually get excited about food but he loved the cheesecake (good thing since it was his birthday!).  The service however was a bit slow.  We had the ask the waitress each time we wanted our drinks refilled.  That wouldn't be a major issue if their prices were significantly lower but at almost $60 for the meal the service should have been impecible.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville?start=100,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152
79,Tj P.,"Louisville, KY",181,275,604.0,3.0,2012-05-24,"I have pondered on what to write for this momentous anniversary, my 100th review. And I've gone back and forth in regard to which spot I would choose to review, if I would dig from the 2-year vault or simply go with something more recent. So, I decided to basically straddle the fence and review a place I've been twice, recently and some time ago. However, this review will be mostly based on my latest visit. It's rare that I get a relative in town, even rarer that I have the opportunity to join them for a moment or two when they are here. Thankfully, with my new work schedule, I was available to do both. Meeting my aunt while she was in town for a conference was a nice way to spend a part of my evening, no matter the venue, but the Cheesecake Factory made for a pleasant backdrop. Spacious and beautifully appointed, the Cheesecake Factory is perfect for large casual groups or intimate couples. On this occasion, my aunt and I were joined by several of her co-workers. Most were from much smaller areas of Kentucky and the chance to see a little bit of the ""big city"", and enjoy some ""fine dining"" was likely part of the draw to eat here. Personally, I prefer smaller, local restaurants but the Factory was probably better suited to accommodate the group.  Because the group was moderately large and each of us were on separate bills, it did take some time for dinner to arrive. Dinner portions are huge. You pay for the size though and I wouldn't call it gourmet. Like much of the Cheesecake Factory, the food suffers from a bit of puffery, making things appear more than average. Sadly, average is what it is. The fish tacos I had were dry and bland, the chicken pasta my aunt had was swimming in olive oil. The thing about it is you don't come here for dinner, you truly come for dessert. Unfortunately, you may come away disappointed in that regard too. While the cheesecake is fantastically delicious, this is the one area where the portions are small for what you pay. All in all, while the restaurant experience was somewhat lacking, I came away enjoying the moment and the time spent with my aunt. In my book, that's a win.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville?start=60,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.052000000000001
129,Matt H.,"Fairmont, WV",7,6,,1.0,2012-07-03,"The food was excellent, but the service was the worst! My sister and I ate at this Cheesecake Factory Saturday June 30th around 9:00. Our waiter never checked on us once. We were never offered refills. My sister got the wrong food, and it was never corrected. Very slow service as well. The waiter spent a lot of time at the table in front of us, and would walk past our table. We were right next to the computer used to enter orders.

128,John H.,"Louisville, KY",40,13,,1.0,2012-07-21,"I had lunch there today, thanks to a gift card I received for Xmas. There was a ten minute wait for a table for some reason, even though I could see 10-15 empty tables in a section where they just weren't seating anybody. There wasn't anywhere to sit during this wait, because there were so many other people waiting, so we stood the entire time.  When our food finally arrived 30 minutes after we were seated, our orders were wrong. The food runner set everything down as fast as he could and ran away before we could tell him. He delivered two identical sandwiches, but called one a club and one a blackened chicken. I guess he could only tell the difference because of the side items, which were both NOT the sides we ordered. Five minutes later, our server came to check on us and started to correct our order, That whole process took another ten minutes. The blackened chicken came in two minutes while the sweet potato fries came five minutes after that. So, either the chicken was sitting under a heat lamp the entire time, or it was sitting on another table where someone else touched it and took it apart to realize they had the wrong sandwich. I know they didn't remake it because it came too quick. I know mistakes happen, but if the food runner had spent more than five seconds delivering our food, it could have worked out better.  By the time this was all worked out, we were both so frustrated that we barely ate the bland $12 chicken sandwiches and were ready to leave. The only thing that was faster than the food runner was our server when we asked for our check. She was ready to get us out of there, apparently. I spent 50 minutes of life dealing with this place. I want those 50 minutes back. I will never go back to this place. Ever. You lost me as a customer. Forever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville?start=120,2.9480000000000004,2.9480000000000004,2.9480000000000004,2.9480000000000004,2.9480000000000004
59,Kelly Y.,"Louisville, KY",88,290,1046.0,4.0,2012-08-09,"""No wonder this place is so damn popular.""  I thought to myself as I gobbled down more of the chicken cutlet.   This chicken cutlet from the Chicken Bellagio was so good, I told hubby it is a revelation for someone with a tired, choosy foodie mouth like me.  I never order white meat chicken when dining out cuz 9 out of 10 times it is going to be dry.  Well, I finally met that other 1 out of 10 times with this dish!  At the base is a large serving of capellini pasta flavored with basil; add two of those perfectly tender, flavorful chicken cutlets; add a big slice of prosciutto; then top the whole thing with a small mound of arugula salad.  The peppery bite of the arugula and salty prosciutto perfectly complements the chicken.  One bite of this mix will make you want more and more.  And I really appreciate the care and attention that went into the making of this dish.  They even chopped up the arugula so the diner does not have to wrestle with leaves bigger than their mouths!   We also ordered their Chicken Samosas appetizer.  It was the best version of samosas!  It's probably not authentic since the shell is made of the really thin, crispy skin, but that made it much more appetizer-appropriate.  We loved every bite of it.    Oh, yes, hubby said his Cuban sandwich was awesome as well.   I'm not a huge fan of cheesecakes so I ordered their tiramisu (not the cheesecake version) instead.  Mehhhhh, it was not that impressive.  I don't like it when restaurants mess with perfection such as adding chocolate sauce to this tiramisu.  The ladyfingers could have been more moist; the mascarpone layer tasted more like pudding...dont think I will get it again.  But I'm sure hubby liked his cheesecake, though.  Service was friendly, efficient and perfectly timed.  Our server gave us plenty of time to peruse the extensive menu.  He was always there at the right time for refills.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville?start=40,3.3760000000000003,3.3760000000000003,3.3760000000000003,3.3760000000000003,3.376000000000001

91,Jim G.,"Louisville, KY",2,10,2.0,2.0,2013-02-20,"Being an old senior citizen, it is hard to try new things. Grandson gave my wife & I a gift card for Christmas. The Louisville Mall looks like Christmas on a Saturday. Cars are backed up on the X-press way exiting onto Shelbyville Rd. Remember, 90% of the people are working, and few thousand Ford employees just got $8K  bonus. All that might explain the 40 minute wait. No chairs of any kind for old seniors to sit and wait. F.  Finally seated, and a waiter is going to impress me with his ability to remember what I ordered without writing it down. That always scares me. True to form, order was wrong. Another F. Didn't bring the salad until they noticed it was missing after the main meal was served. It included the wrong dressing. Had Blue Cheese, which I detest. My wife tasted it and said it was delicious. Couple 18 inches away in a long line of bench backed seating tables offered us some beans that you sucked out of the shell. Hey, this is KY, I had never heard of them,. They were great. Meals finally arrived, our waiter RENEE (The Mentalist) or something I could not understand, was ""On Break"" and a nice fellow was serving us. They brought the bread that was suppose to be as an appetizer with the meal. Overall food was very good. The grilled onions on my burger were great. French Fries way above average for Louisville; but leave salt off next time. My wife enjoyed here food too and the portions were such that we took  a doggie Bag home. Tried the ""famous Cheese cake. One step above Whipped Jell-O in a box. Save your money for something in the mall. The ambience of the place in noisey and you think your at a Casino in Vegas.

131,Ka-Lin H.,"Louisville, KY",24,95,8.0,3.0,2013-02-21,"I love Cheesecake factory. It's one of my favorite chain restaurants. They have huge portions and they are USUALLY consistent. However, this cheesecake factory is the least consistent of them all... and their ingredients are below average. I always get the calamari for appetizer, whether I eat in or take it togo. I have noticed that the portions of the calamari here is WAYYY smaller than all the other cheesecake factories. In addition, the last two times I got the calamari togo, it had a bad fishy/seafood taste. I love seafood, so I can take strong seafood taste. The calamari just tasted like they were in the freezer forever. Disgusting. The shepards pie I got last time was so gross. It had a strong meat taste. I dunno how old the ground beef was. NOT RECOMMENDED. I'm too scared to ever get the shepard's pie here again. I always get the louisiana chicken pasta, it's usually pretty good here. That's probably the only thing that's consistent so I will keep getting the louisiana chicken pasta from here. I've gotten the chinese chicken salad from here, it came without chicken. WHAT THE HECK??? Overall, this cheesecake factory is not as good as the other ones. This is the only one in Kentucky so I'm stuck with going to this one. Oh.. and I live like 2 minutes away so it's pretty convenient to do the curb side order. I just call ahead of time and they take out the food to my car.

Speaking of which...Oreo is my favorite. My only complaints are the usually long waits and scarce parking.

Not good. The pork was dry! I mean inedibly dry. I picked it off and just ate the ham on the sandwich. I will know better next time. Now, the sweet potato fries. Maybe I have a high standard of anything sweet potato seeing as I grew up in the ""Sweet Potato Capital of the World"" but these were rough. They were super dry and super hard. Some had grease seeping from them and crunch while others were to dry to eat. Meh.  The server. Man oh man. You'd think he was afraid of women. There were four of us. Now, we all like to joke with one another and also with others. I don't know if this guy was just stuck up or he is afraid of women. Either way, he was not good at his job at all.

Chicken lettuce wraps were tasty and served with carrots, cucumbers, noodles, cilantro and bean spouts. They offer three sauces, a thai cilantro sauce, peanut sauce and tangy tempura sauce. All were tasty additions to the boston bibb lettuce that was used to wrap it all up. Potstickers were okay but not great. The soy sauce was a bit salty for my taste. An arugula salad with raisons, nuts and slivers of parmesan in a lemon olive oil dressing was light and delish. You cannot pass up the cheesecake so we had the tuxedo and peanut cup renditions they offer. There are so many choices it takes a while to figure which one to order.

I picked off the vegetables except the lettuce and mayonnaise. Here's the thing, I don't like mayonnaise. I didn't want to be the one scraping it off of the bun with my cloth napkin, so I ate what I had. Later on, we had to wait forever to get cheesecake to go and our checks.

45,Darrell M.,"Louisville, KY",152,10,232.0,4.0,2016-04-04,"Warning: Not an actual factory.  (I know, I know... too cheesy.  (See what I did there? :-D )) In a nutshell: The broadly eclectic menu means there is something for everyone, no matter how divergent your cuisine craving. Reconciling two different cuisine appetites can be a challenge sometimes and such was the case on Sunday night.  Rejecting his recurring Thai food suggestions and suffering a creative block myself, my dining partner threw out The Cheesecake Factory and it magically seemed to be the perfect choice.  (The gift card I received for my birthday last summer may have been the deciding factor.)   Sunday evening was not a particularly busy time and the 10 minute wait passed by in four.  After being seated in the bar area and taking in the somewhat ostentatious décor anew I noticed something which had escaped me before: the vaguely Egyptian theme most evident in the faces atop the columns. The menu is broadly eclectic and dramatically laid out across more than a dozen laminated, spiral bound pages (complete with ample advertising space!)  On some level, I think the notoriously bulky menu is itself both a literal and figurative marketing device.  Getting through the tome is more manageable if you identify the sections first and then delve into the cuisine which sounds most appetizing.  Unfortunately, there is neither a table of contents nor an index. The service was excellent with the perfect balance of attentiveness and graceful interludes of space.  The food was excellent with a portion size that insured leftovers.  The bar menu included trendy cocktails with cheeky names (The Modern Old Fashioned) alongside a deep wine menu and a surprisingly (refreshingly?) small number of well-chosen beers.  A craving for sweet potato fries prompted me to select the Chicken Parmesan sandwich which I paired with a Bells Two Hearted.  Perhaps not the most elegant of choices, but it was a satisfying combination.  Stuffed after eating just half my sandwich, but not yet so full that I hated myself ... I decided to do the only reasonable thing: order the cheesecake to go.  :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville?start=40,3.2,3.2,3.2,3.3120000000000003,3.2000000000000006

21,Kasen M.,"Brownsboro Zorn, Louisville, KY",173,105,2995.0,5.0,2016-07-30,"I took a group of kids for National Cheesecake Day on July 30. On cheesecake day, the Cheesecake Factory always offers half-price pieces of cheesecake. In order to get the half-price discount, you have to dine in. I always look at this as an opportunityto take a group of kids for a real life ""sit down"" restaurant experience.  The Cheesecake Factory is known to be pricey and I work for a non-profit agency. Each year when I take the kids, I make sure to go during a non-peak time. I know the waiters and waitresses work hard for those really big tips off the typical really big bills. Probably lots of folks take advantage of the more affordable cheesecake deal and do what we did. Every year the servers have always been so nice and accommodating. They told us the wait would be 15 to 20 minutes, but we got our table for 7 in about 10 minutes. Long enough for the kids to catch some Pokemon in the lobby.  We had an amazing waitress. She wasn't upset that we only ordered waters to drink. When we sat down I told her we were going to get a few appetizers and then enjoy some of the cheesecake. She seemed happy to serve us. We ordered two pizzas to share. Each pizza had 8 reasonably size slices. She also was quick to refill our drinks and the bread on the table.  She checked on us several times, never making us feel rushed, just being attended to. When the cheesecake came out the kids eyes grew large and their mouths nearly dropped to the table. They'd never seen pieces of cheesecake so big. Having some older kiddos with me, I asked if we could get five coffees. She was quick to bring them along with creamer. The kids, many of them having never been to a ""fancy restaurant"" before were thoroughly impressed with the real creamer. When the check came it was just under $60 for 2 pizzas and 7 slices of cheesecake. As most people do, I slid my credit card into the book and waited for her to take it away. It wasn't until after I had paid and was calculating the tip that I noticed she didn't charge us for coffee.  I'm not sure if she recognized that we were not the typical group of cheesecake factory consumers, but I thought that was really cool of her to not include that on the bill.  I super want to include her name in the review, but don't want to get her in trouble with her boss. So, I'll just say to the Cheesecake Factory: you have some really great people working for you. She was extremely patient, very kind, and truly made this group of kids first sit down fancy restaurant experience something they will remember for years to come. Plus -- the $20 you saved us on coffee can now be spent on other great experiences for my kids -- so thank you and Happy Cheesecake Day!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville?start=20,3.52,3.52,3.52,3.3160000000000003,3.5200000000000005

10,Elizabeth C.,"Waddy, KY",20,260,585.0,4.0,2016-08-26,"Any fan of The Big Bang Theory knows The Cheesecake Factory features prominently in the series... And, things like the enormous size of the establishment's menu are sometimes discussed.  Having never been to one before, when we found one on our recent trip to Kentucky, we just HAD TO go! It was after noon on a Saturday and the place was HOPPING.  We had a rather large party, so it was a bit of a wait for a table, but, to be honest, they told us 15 minutes, and it didn't take more than 5.  This allowed us ample time to drool over their Cheesecake display... which is dangerously extensive!  In addition, and I'm not sure if all Cheesecake Factories look alike, but, the decor in this one was an entertainment in itself.  It seriously looked like it belonged in Vegas! Once seated, they were quick to bring us our drink orders and VERY understanding after we sent them away twice so we could read through the book, and I do mean BOOK, that is their menu.  The jokes are true folks... their menu is crazy.  You can pretty much find anything you might be craving... This too, was my first experience with ordering beverages in Kentucky, which was a 2 fold learning experience...   #1 - They do eveything big here and drinks are no exception.  I'm used to having to practically beg for a tiny glass of water everywhere I go in California, but here... they mean business.  You want water?  You get a GIANT glass!   #2 - Sweet Tea versus Unsweet Tea.  If you order Iced Tea, there's a slight assumption you mean Sweet Tea... If you want what I call Iced Tea... you have to order Unsweet Tea.  Not a big deal, just took my brain a little bit of getting used to.  Also, I had a sip of some sweet tea and damn, do they mean it!  So, if you don't want to drink tea flavored sugar water, you might want to pass!  And, since they make Tea sweet, I don't think they get that people might want to sweeten it themselves because there never seemed to be packets of sugar or sweetener anywhere we went... I never ordered coffee, but maybe they bring you some then? Ok, I digress.  We all ordered something different and I will say, despite service being friendly, and them refilling our ginormous drinks promptly whenever we drank 1/2 the glass, no matter what we ordered, the food took FOREVER.  We were later told that Well Done burgers take a minimum of 20 minutes to cook.  Odd.. but... ok...  Since a number of us ordered burgers, we were the hold up?  Also, true to form, everyone at the table was served, except for my husband, despite him ordering what was arguably the simplest thing at the table... We're not sure why, but this happens to him... a lot!  And, once his food DID arrive they brought it out in stages... which consequently meant he got an extra side dish...  I guess that made up for him having to watch us all eat for 5 minutes? I ordered a Mac & Cheese Burger because I'd had one at a posh joint in Denver and was pretty disappointed.  I was curious if a chain like The Cheesecake Factory could improve on it, and do it cheaper... and boy, did they!  It was arguably the cheesiest burger I've ever had.  I had subbed in a side of Sweet Potato Fries and those were excellent as well.  A friend of ours at the table had never had Sweet Potato fries and I guess the ones at Cheesecake Factory made him a believer, because he's ordering them everywhere now! Everyone seemed to enjoy their choices and we were all stuffed... which was kind of a bummer... I wanted Cheesecake!  Then again... how could you ever choose what kind to try?!?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville,3.64,3.64,3.64,3.152,3.6400000000000006

So we arrive, parking is ridiculous as St Matthews tends to be during the holidays (no stars knocked off for this). There was a 40 minute wait at cheesecake factory which is normal (again, no stars knocked off for this).

We get up there and they say ""ohh.... it must of been 2 parties of Lewis for 4 because someone already came up here.

The Renee's special was just ok. Good sandwich and soup, but salad is meh. Sandwich portion was tiny for a $13 meal.  The biggest con of TCF for me are the prices. A lot of their entrees and appetizers are really overpriced. Their Cheesecake sizes (depending on flavor) can be vastly different but they all cost $8 per slice.  Most recent visit, got the chicken littles dinner which was $15.50. Got a great portion of chicken, but didn't know until my check that subbing Mac n cheese as a side brought the entree to 18.75! Seriously? Splitting the app, getting this entree and a slice of cheesecake set me back $40 for just my check. For me, TCF is a once in awhile place, not a regular go-to, and that's almost entirely because they are overpriced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville?start=20,3.48,3.53,3.53,3.1160000000000005,3.5100000000000002

7,Jason H.,"New Albany, IN",65,61,33.0,3.0,2017-03-14,"Prepare to spend a long time here - not necessarily because service is slow, but their expansive menu takes time to read and digest. My main issue is with so many options how do you choose? In addition, they tend to be hit or miss. The American options are really good, but the Chinese and Mexican options are sub par. My most recent visit was with a large group of about 15. I ordered the Steak Diane and it was delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly, the sauce added a ton of flavor and the mashed potatoes were really good. In addition, I was able to sample a number of appetizers. The crab dip was not very good. It had a very fishy taste and was pretty bland tasting. No one liked it. The spinach dip had an overwhelmingly taste of spinach, which some people like. I was not a fan. The chicken blast were awesome. Probably the highlight of our lunch. Basically, they take buffalo chicken dip and then they fry it. Served with a delicious buffalo sauce and ranch. Lastly, we had the loaded/stuffed tots. Tater tots stuffed with a loaded baked potato. Also very good (especially with the spicy mayo). Everyone's entree looked good. I can't wait to go back and try the mac and cheese burger. The fish and shrimp tacos both received praise and I would like to try these as well. As noted above, stay away from the burritos and the orange chicken dishes. The main draw is of course dessert. I was able to sample a variety of cheesecake and they were all phenomenal. I don't remember the names, but the salted caramel was good as was the lemon raspberry. Our group also had a Reese's, some kind of chocolate turtle, and a chocolate blonde. One server cared for our group of 15 and she did a great job balancing the group with her other tables. Our drinks were refreshed at the halfway point nearly every time. Empty dishes were promptly removed to make space for the next items All in all, this place is great for dessert, but just OK for lunch and dinner. Prices are a little high for what you get.

6,Vien L.,"Saint Matthews, KY",44,143,328.0,1.0,2017-04-30,"I'm not too much of a fan of big chain restaurants. I feel they've let me down far too many times at this point. The first was Wolfgang Puck, then TGI Friday's, and now ol' Cheesecake Factory. I hate writing bad reviews. I like having good food.  We started with appetizers and were considering how expensive everything is. Should be good right? For what I'm paying for? Quality and tasty food? It let me down. I had a great time here because I came with fantastic company. But the grub was not up to standard. I can make a much better meal from pantry items on the fly. We started with stuffed mushrooms, and the firecracker salmon. The stuffed mushrooms were decent. No real complaint there I suppose. A bit greasy but tasty nonetheless. Now the firecracker salmon was another story. I have to show you and let you decide. Considering what we expected versus what we received... it was a strong fail. Just by the looks of it. Greasy, disproportional portions and oh so sloppy. I thought our waitress just didn't carry it over straight, so the dish just slid to one side. Then there was the chicken pasta da Vinci. It was just plain pasta noodles with some mushrooms and some chicken. Now this is where I swear I can do better with pantry items. One box of pasta cooked al dente. One can of campbells cream of mushroom and a half can of water. Some fresh whole mushrooms sliced up and sautéed in butter and a bit of salt... And some chicken. Any chicken. Even canned chunk chicken drained and rinsed. Cook it up and serve it. It would be more flavorful than this pasta dish at Cheesecake Factory, and less greasy. It just wasn't very flavorful. And the amount of chicken and mushrooms in my dish was pitiful. For the price, it could've had a garden salad or something thrown in. I feel like I ate unhealthy food, and yet it wasn't rewarding... like a dirty food truck taco would've been a better way to go than this faux fancy place.  There are so many restaurateurs in Louisville at a similar price point. I just don't see the point in spending so much and getting so little in return. Plus, I didn't feel a whole lot of love from our waitress. The cheesecake was good though. One star for that! I won't be back though. I want a good pasta place in Louisville... one that makes the pasta in house. If I was by myself, I might've sent a dish back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville,3.6,3.56,3.56,2.7880000000000003,3.5760000000000005

Remarkably it was on the 2nd of 2 days celebrating National Cheesecake Day. Our wait during dinner time was relatively short. Our server, Andrea, was fabulous! She came to the table quickly after we were seated, greeted us, and took our drink orders. Within a few minutes, she brought our drinks and a fresh basket of bread. She asked if we wanted to begin with an appetizer, and when declined, she told us about the nightly specials. She took our orders, after I asked a couple questions and asked for her recommendation between two entrees. She kept our drinks filled during our entire meal, and she interacted with us frequently. I ordered the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad and my friend ordered Spicy Cashew Chicken with extra sauce. (This is the dish that I normally order, but I decided to order off of the SkinnyLicious menu to save room for cheesecake.) Both of our entrees were delicious! My friend only ate half of her meal, and Andrea boxed it up. I ate my entire salad. The tuna was fresh, tender, and spicy, and the shallot dressing made for a great finish. After dinner, I debated on which cheesecake to order. I decided to go with the new Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch Cheesecake, and my friend ordered the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. My cheesecake had Nutella on top. Mmm. The best part--all cheesecakes were half-price! We both asked for our cheesecakes to be boxed to-go, because we were only planning to eat a few bites before taking the rest home. Both of us were very pleased with our choices. Both of us would recommend our entrees and cheesecakes. Andrea's attentiveness, humor, kindness, and work ethic made our dining experience quite pleasant.

The basics for a house salad? And an establishment as yourself I would expect better.  The taquitos I had- after eating what I could- because the chicken on the ends was absolutely BURNT- not just toasted but burnt!!!! I told our server I couldn't eat it- and he obliged and had it taken off our bill.  1 of my friends were offered a box to take her food- when 2 other of my friends needed a box as well but when he didn't even offer and walked away from the table- they decided they were no longer taking it home.  We ordered cheesecake- and when we asked for a box for one of my other friends- he brought out a box that wouldn't even fit hers-- so I had to ask the manager for the proper box so she could take hers and enjoy it at home...  the other girls also decided they wanted a box for theirs as well- when we asked he said he couldn't keep going behind the counter because of how busy it was.  Well as I said I'm in this industry as well- and when it comes to guests needs- the guest should ALWAYS come 1st.... we were ALL pretty disappointed with our service this evening- if ever we decide to return I just hope that the service won't be compromised due to the amount of business at the time ...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville?start=40,3.44,3.62,3.62,,3.5480000000000005

20,Tina F.,"Mount Washington, KY",0,6,2.0,3.0,2017-12-16,"Ordered for two using Grubhub since I was recovering from surgery and could not get out and about.  Ordered the Teriyaki chicken and the Shepherds Pie and two cheesecakes.  The food was lukewarm and the cheesecakes were also warm.  The teriyaki chicken was not what I expected, one large piece of skin on chicken and rice, it was very very dry.  The Shepherds Pie was ordered by my mother. She reviewed it very poorly.  Due to the taste she mainly ate the potatoes.  The cheesecakes were ok.  Later in the evening we both had stomach issues.  Needless to say we will not be doing delivery again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville?start=20,3.44,3.6,3.6,,3.5360000000000005
1,Robert S.,"Palm Beach, FL",13,78,13.0,3.0,2018-01-13,"I wish I had perfect words for this legacy restaurant. However the foods I've ordered and requested low sodium have been off the last few times.  Maybe they just can't alter the recipes to make them taste good without loading then up with salt, salt and then more salt...   The service was spot on with an adorable young server that my wife and I remarked to her that she is a super star and is headed places in her life (an accounting major working her way through college) She won our heart but the food didn't.  Bottom line... don't even think about going here if you're trying to eat healthy for the new year.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville,3.36,3.58,3.58,,3.4920000000000004
