Recently, I went to The Cheesecake Factory with five other people. Our waitress was named Patricia K. It seemed like she was annoyed with us the whole time she was serving us. She probably didn't make any effort because of the automatic 18 percent gratuity.  She asked if I wanted her to pack my food to go, except I couldn't answer because I was still in the middle of eating when she rudely took my plate away without even waiting for my response. I wish I could have gone to the manager and asked for an adjustment on the tip because she certainly did not deserve 20 bucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=640,3.56,3.55,3.55,3.3120000000000003,3.5540000000000003

I ordered the grilled turkey burger my husband ordered the white chicken chili.

761,Emma J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,23,,4.0,2012-02-12,"I love the plain cheesecake here with strawberries on top.  There are tons of innovative flavors, but the classic is definitely the best.  My other favorite dish is the hot spinach artichoke dip - it is practically a meal in itself. This is a really nice location with lots of seating overlooking the marina.  I would probably come here just for the atmosphere and view even if I didn't love the food. Parking is a bit annoying - you have the option of valet parking or self-parking for the same price, but the lot is crowded and you park in the same place as the valeted cars so it is weird to self-park.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=720,3.56,3.55,3.55,3.408,3.5540000000000003

493,Lewis Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",296,189,4437.0,5.0,2012-03-08,"I have to first start off by saying this is the BEST CHEESECAKE FACTORY I've been to by far. From the delectable foods and ambrosial ambiance to the delightful decor  and surprisingly speedy service, this location cannot be rivaled.  The main purpose for going to this location was to catch it to have dinner before the sunset! Apparently that didn't quite work since I live in Southern LA area and it being LA traffic was a major factor.. I didn't quite make it on time and got there when the sun was already in! Either way I still go to enjoy the perfect weather and breeze this place offers. Upon arrival the inside looked quite small so the hostess offered the ""Beach Front"" which I had no idea what it was, thought the patio was where we were going to be seated, I was wrong, this place is actually closer to the water and from what I heard she said its ""NEW"". I was amazed how everything look well set up... you have fire pits, cabanas, lounge etc. It was just amazing how everything looked, you wouldn't think it was Cheesecake Factory... and that is why I say.. THIS IS THE BEST ONE I'VE BEEN TO! Another thing you have to keep in mind if you want to dine in the Beach Front.. they only offer the Top 100 dishes on their menu. Now on to the service!.. Service was GREAT and our waiters name was IAN. I asked what drinks he recommends and which will have a better acquiring taste! He was on top of things very polite and never once did he disappear after he took our order (which usually happens at most places.) I assume at times waiters know who looks like a ""BIG TIPPER"" so they tend to cater more to those people. But that was not the case here because I sure don't look like or dress the part of a BIG TIPPER, but in this case I did not mind putting down a 15% from a $133 bill. I never put that much down as a tip, but felt like he really deserved it! Now on to the food!.. Since I was outside and its only TOP 100 dishes, to me they all sound good. Dishes I got to try were: Fried Macaroni & Cheese Balls: (10/10) WOW!!.. ORGASMIC!!.. I shed a couple of tears after trying this. Soooo cheesy and the taste was just incredible. With the first bite I really didn't wanna share the rest, wanted all 4 of them for myself! Chicken Alfredo: (10/10) This is definitely on my TOP 3 Alfredo List!.. One good thing that gave it a plus and out-shined the others was the BIG chunks of chicken that come with this dish!.. enough said.. THIS PLATE IS A MUST!   Crispy Chicken Costoletta: (10/10) I'm a picky eater so when I saw asparagus I just glanced over on to the next item.. but here comes IAN to the rescue again and recommended this dish. So took his word and I was really amazed. It was 3 thin sliced breast and lightly breaded which makes it better (too breading makes certain items not worthy) and for the side dish was mashed potatoes!... and what makes these potatoes better than others?.. RED POTATOES & CHUNK BITES!!.. So it's not all that mushy (hope that's a word!) Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake: (10/10) GRAND FINALE was this... ORGASMIC!!!... TWICE!!.. It was just an amazing day with food and the scenery and to top it of with this dessert! MOST DEFINITELY I WILL BECOME A REGULAR HERE!!  =D",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=460,3.6,3.51,3.51,3.3480000000000003,3.5460000000000003
925,mary k.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,18,,5.0,2012-03-09,OK so I realize we all love cheese cake factory but this location in particular is the one to go to for all my West LA peeps.  I've been here several times and the food/drinks always live up to the high cheese cake factory standards.  BUT what sets this location apart from all the other is I have never waiting more than 20 minutes to sit the and the view of the marina is literally a million dollar view. Even if its a little chilly out the heat lamps keep the outside deck very comfortable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=840,3.64,3.53,3.53,3.3160000000000003,3.5740000000000003
541,Jay T.,"Irvine, CA",132,382,56.0,5.0,2012-03-10,"This was hands down the nicest Cheesecake Factory I've been to. I haven't made it to the original in Beverly Hills, but this one definitely tops the one at the Grove. Waterfront location, right on the Marina, especially if you go to the ""Beachfront"" section. The great view makes up for the lack of the full menu. I came here with my gf on a Fri night, so the place was pretty crowded. I don't know how long it would have taken to get seated inside, but the wait for the outdoor ""Beachfront"" was about 5 minutes. This area is pretty big, and it seemed a bit understaffed as the waiters were all quite harried, but that didn't result in a negative experience. They were all extremely courteous, down to filling the water glass as soon as it was empty (if not before). As far as I can tell, everything on the menu is pretty great. The items that cost more than $12 end up actually being cheaper because there's too much food and you can take half home for another meal. And you can always have as much complimentary bread as you want. Go for the wheat, it's great. The sourdough isn't bad, but it pales in comparison. The main downside of this location is the mandatory valet parking in the lot in front of the restaurant. Being the cheap suburbanite I am, I decided to just park on Washington (the meters are free after 6) and walk the couple of blocks over instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=520,3.68,3.57,3.57,3.22,3.6140000000000003

739,GG M.,"Los Angeles, CA",83,686,140.0,3.0,2012-04-02,"The warner center and grove location both have better tasting food and menu IMO. But, pussy-whipped into bringing in-laws here. Orders: Nacho appetizer=gigantic, but not enough salsa, or even close. If they paid a bit more attention to this dish it would be great. Chips are crisp and hot, cheese could be better distributed across nachos. Chicken Bellagio=ridiculous amounts of sodium. Basil pasta underneath so salty that youre better off skipping that part, heavy salty buttery cream sauce. If I was 1/2 my age no prob, but hard to digest for a 37 year old. Chicken lightly breaded and tasted good. They put 2 slices of prosciutto, I'll eat that with anything! And top it with aragula, kinda gets owned by the cream sauce and heat of the plate. Fried shrimp and fries=you order this your asking for it, wivey had it and it vas very ""Gordon's fish"" like. Cole slaw was gross and tasted raw/unwashed/like dirt/you get da picture. Pizzas=decent, good cheese, toppings, crust.  Service=changed 3 servers by the time we decided on a right table, but good overall. Very ho-hum place. You eat one meal here at 1pm and you dont need to worry about food before, during, or after, anytime until you wake up the next morning with garlic dragon breath, no matter how many times you brush/rinse/floss.

699,Barry B.,"Los Angeles, CA",77,20,,4.0,2012-05-04,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite chain restaurants, because i like everything i've tried from their menu.  I also like the ambiance and beach view.  Plus it's close by me. :) I've tried a few items from the menu, but my all time favorite is the ""Miso Salmon"" and this review is for that.  I love seafood and i normally get fried shrimp or crab legs when i go have seafood at restaurants known for their seafood.  Of course Cheesecake Factory doesn't sell crab legs. :(  So therefore I decided to try the Miso Salmon here on a visit a while back and i'm now addicted to it....and can't seem to bring myself to move on to something else on the menu.  The miso glaze gives the salmon a nice semi-sweet taste, but definitely not over bearing.  I would actually recommend this dish to anyone who wants to give seafood a try, and not worry about it tasting fishy. Oh....and if you like Carrot cake, you have to try it here.  Other than the Palm restaurant, i would rate their Carrot cake as my favorite.

For drinks, I had a lemondrop martini.  The drink tasted like a very concentrated lemonaid, but boy did it kick a punch!   It came in a sugared rim glass and a lemon twist.   Very clean and refreshing!  Grade:  B For my main meal, I decided to order a tapas sampling from their ""skinny menu"".  The first dish was an arugula salad.  YUM!  The dish was baby arugula served with freshly sliced parm cheese, and toasted almonds and yellow rasins.  The dressing was a citrus and olive oil sauce and it was simply delicious!  Grade:  A- My second tapas sampling was the beet & goat cheese salad.  This dish was red beets cubed, tossed with granny smith apple chunks, and served with arugula salad and toasted pecans.  The salad had a lot of potential, but somehow it missed the mark for me.  Perhaps it was because the beets were dull (didn't taste like freshly cooked beets, nor did they taste like canned beets).   Nothing popped out at me while eating the salad.  Grade:  B- My third tapas sampling was the artichoke heart and krab dip.  There was a dip made up of artichoke hearts, krab pieces, and cream sauce.  Served with about 6-7 slices of French bread toastinis.   This dish missed the mark for me.  In fact, it took 2 bites of the dish and decided to throw the rest away.  It lacked flavor, and it tasted like it was slopped together.  Wasn't worth the stomach space.  Grade:  D- For my dessert, I orderd the red velvet cheesecake!  OMG DELICIOUS!   This was the highlight of my meal!  This was two layers of red velvet cake, with a middle of cheesecake, and topped with a rich cream cheese topping.   This was perhaps the best cheesecake that I've eaten at this restaurant chain!   The serving was huge and it was fun to eat!  Grade:  A-. What I liked best about the dining experience was that the menu was HUGE!  There was like 20 pages of a menu - varying from American, to Asian, to a bit of creole in the dish choices.  There is always something for everyone to eat here - and this was reflected in the very diverse clintele eating here!

Me and 3 friends went to lunch on Saturday, 6/23/12. Our waiter, Mika, was very kind and pleasant, however, he was also a bit forgetful. He took his break, and introduced our new server, Matt. The only problem is that Matt only took our order for drinks, not our food. We ended up waiting for Mika to come back from his 30 min break to order our food. THEN, as we watch other tables, who arrived after we did, get their food before we did, the food finally arrives another 30 mins later.   The food was great, with the exception of one of my girlfriends. She ordered salad and chicken wings...the problem was that the chicken wings were still RAW in the middle. We asked for the manager, and a gentleman came to our table. I did not get his name unfortunately, but he attempted to tell her that it was a blood vessel that popped during their ""double cooking"" process.   As a mom, and a cook, you know that the blood would be burgundy if the blood vessel popped during the frying, not RED! Thank goodness, he took it off the bill, but we were dissatisfied all together that instead of accepting responsibility, he made it seem as if the chicken was supposed to be that way.  The friend who recomended that we visit this establishment, said that she had pristine service before, so we were all baffled at the mistreatment we received on our visit.   On the plus side, the scenery  and location is breathtaking, but I regret my visit and would not recommend ANYONE to visit this restaurant....if you expect great service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=680,3.64,3.62,3.62,2.7600000000000007,3.6280000000000006

240,Judy L.,"San Diego, CA",10,126,,1.0,2012-07-26,"I hate this Cheesecake Factory. Hate it. And usually, it takes very little to satisfy me, so this location just sucks. I'm not deluding myself, this is a CHEESECAKE factory. Where there be a Westfield Mall, there shall be one! ... So I'm not expecting 5 star dining or anything, just my usual standard fare. The first thing --- Valet parking ONLY. Wtf? What if I want to park the car myself? It also takes longer to get my car through valet than just walking out the door onto the lot. The fact that you have to pay $4.50 for the service as well is just a slap in the face. Sure, maybe for many in this area, $4.50 is chump change but I just hate that is was mandatory! It was $4.50 for dinner, from what I read, lunch valet is cheaper. We went on a Sunday evening. We were driving back from San Pedro and we were starving! Our options were the Redondo Beach location or this one, else wait for the long drive back to Thousand Oaks and eat there (we couldn't wait). We asked for a table for two inside, were told 30mins, took a pager but found a table at the bar and as we were sitting, our pager buzzed. Huh? Why tell us 30mins? It didn't matter either way because we were fine with the bar table but we had sat and then had to get up and wait 5mins to be seated again. Our server and service were minimal. We weren't dressed to impress, that's for sure, since we were on Catalina Island for most part of the day. I wonder if that was why? We got what we needed I guess ... just took a little bit of a wait. I ALWAYS order a side of sweet potato fries for an appetizer (sometimes as my meal, but shhhh). I always order it right away, because a kid at heart is an impatient one. We also ordered the factory burrito to share, sans the chicken. We did ask for extra wheat bread and got that while we waited a long time for the fries. And when it finally came, it was half the portion size that we normally get at any of the cheesecake factories we normally attend. I was kind of dismayed, I waited all day for these! Oh well. But not only that, it was missing the usual spicy garlic aoili or whatever they call it. I've been there enough times to know that it's not a thing where only one restaurant serves it a certain way ... so we asked for it and the server (another) basically was like ""no, we have a garlic aoili but it does not go with that"" and we were like uhhh ... can we have it? Didn't taste exactly like it though so we were disappointed. I know that people probably don't order that side as often but he was basically saying it like ""uh no you're wrong"" and I don't like that :( especially when it's about my unhealthy obsession (in more ways than one) with the sweet potato fries. Our factory burrito was worse ... Usually it's huge! This one was tiny and it was lacking that sauce it normally comes with, in which it definitely needed as well! Inside there is just white rice and vegetables and so there's no liquid and without that sauce it's kind of difficult to eat. I wasn't too happy about that ... We'd had a long day and so it was just a disappointing meal! It was my birthday and so I did get a birthday Sundae but asked them not to sing when they came up to the table. I was not feeling it. But it was really sweet that one of the waiters was like ""but we're already here!"" but whispered behind his band ""happy birthday!"" quietly. So that was good.  Overall my experience sucked. Service could have been better. I just wanted yummy fries :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=740,3.24,3.57,3.57,2.7880000000000003,3.438

We were just given the table a minute ago, what do you mean it can't be rearranged?! Of course, Mr. Manager gets frustrated and starts giving us a harder time. Our guests arrive to a scene where we are arguing with Steven. Because we didn't want to cause a bigger scene in front of our guests, we say fine give us another table.

524,Marco D.,"Malibu, CA",480,347,193.0,3.0,2012-10-14,"Dined there with a group of 4.  The wait sucks ass, I don't know what it is about a food chain restaurant that makes people want to run to it. 45 minutes for a table was a bit much, thank god that our hostess was kind enough to honor our request for first available booth.  The service was phenomenal, our waiter was amazingly kind and helpful. Bad note on the bartender for not knowing how to make a Jack Rose but it's ok. Our booth was facing a window that overlooks the Marina which would be great but the moon wasn't out so it was a big dark nothing.  As far as the food goes, the menu is one giant encyclopedia of everything. I understand that as a chain they have to keep their options open to appeal to as many people as possible but come on, you don't put the chicken tacos next to the Fillet Mignon.  I had the Cobb salad and my group had New Orleans Shrimp (ok) and two Petites steaks (not good at all). My salad was good but not worth the 16 dollars. Then again you don't come here for the salad so up to you.  This place is safe but that is all, don't expect to be surprised or to walk out with a smile in your face.

Sure, valet parking sucks, but I found parking for a weekday lunch just two blocks away and sauntered over. Sitting out on the patio overlooking a somewhat surreal vision of a beach... a few blocks from the Pacific, we ordered from a patient, upbeat server. Soon, she brought our meals--my friend's Pasta Da Vinci (basically a version of Marsala, 2.5-3 stars) and my Santa Fe Chicken Salad (4 stars, even if not the traditional flavor I have come to expect from places like Bread and Porridge in Santa Monica). We followed up with what the Factory does best--cheesecake. Now, my piece seemed significantly smaller than my friends, but it was still a little bit of heaven in its seasonal pumpkiny goodness. But, OMG, I had a bite of her chocolate one--I think the Godiva--and it was AMAZING. I'd go back just for that... sitting on the surreal beach.  Bottom line: Sometimes chains don't suck as much as you think. Try the salad. Get the chocolate cheesecake.

672,Bethany K.,"Orange County, CA",102,597,106.0,4.0,2013-01-12,"My husband LOVE LOVE LOVES the Cheesecake Factory... probably partially because of the whole NBA-players-love-it phenomenon (Google it!).  You probably already know about the gigantic menu and often good service, huge portions, etc, so I'll just get to it. LOGISTICS *We used to go to the Brentwood location... until it closed. *SOB* *Unavoidable valet parking for $5... I was super tempted to drive around to find an alternative, but whatevs. It was cold. *Curbside to go is a great option! Review the hugeo menu online, call in your fav, you don't get to eat as much bread (which could be a good thing...) and you just call when you get there and they bring it out for you with the bill. They run in to ring up your card (who uses cash nowadays?) and off you go! No wait, designated parking spots, and you also get to avoid the $5 parking... win win. *I've never known a Cheesecake Factory to not have an annoyingly long wait during anything remotely close to ""peak hours."" Dinner at 9pm on a Friday, thankfully, is not considered ""peak hours"" :) *Have not yet enjoyed the view----I guess that's why people suck up the $5!  FOOD *I would rather get half as much food... but it is what it is. Share items, if you can agree on what to order (ha) or ask for a To Go box early so you don't accidentally-I-mean-uh eat everything! *Thank you, fellow reviewers, for mentioning the Avocado Egg Rolls ($10)--they were GREAT. You get 6 decent sized eggrolls (or I guess it's technically 3, cut into halves) with a BOMB sauce. I think they're vegetarian... but didn't ask. *One of my FAVORITE hidden gems: KALE SALAD! It's on the ""Small Plates and Snacks"" page -- not on the Salad... or Side Salad... or Entree Salad sections. Kale salad. $5.95 (!) and a decent size--with the bread and an appetizer or dessert or bites of other people's food, it's definitely enough for an entree. I think it has... apples... and almonds? and... other yummy things. Simple, but tasty... and honestly, the Cheesecake Factory is not known for it's *simplicity* lol. The dressing (which is delish) is not vegan but it's a pepper-y buttermilk and I remember it (pre-vegan days) being delish! HIDDEN GEM. *Some of my other favorites (pre-vegan): Miso Salmon (loved this so much I obsessively Google'd for the recipe and tried replicating at home more than once), Garlic Noodles, and the Strawberry Shortcake dessert! I'm not the biggest fan of cheesecake (irony of ironies) but LOVE their Strawberry Shortcake... biscuitybready shortcake, vanilla ice cream, and lots of strawberries. *bliss* Anyway, we'll obviously be at the Cheesecake Factory more than I could hope or ask for, but it's consistent and the selection is great so it is what it is. I would give it 3 stars for the stupid $5 parking and how they're so obviously contributing to part of why Americans over-eat (lol semi-serious) but whatever--it is what it is!

700,Lori R.,"San Pedro, CA",123,20,,2.0,2013-03-01,"It pains me to write this review. My husband and I had our first date here 16 years ago and try to get back every year or so on that anniversary. We've always loved the food, although every time we go they've removed another item we like from the menu. There is now only one item left of our favorites. Because there always such a long wait for a table, we arrived mid-afternoon, hoping they would be less crouded. It was. We walked right in, only to find the hostess station un-manned. We waited a few minutes but no one showed up. We looked to the bakery immediately behind us hoping to ask for help there, but it was un-manned as well. After about 10 minutes someone showed up and we were seated. As the hostess sat us down, she explained that we might have a longer than normal wait, as the waitress was busy. I looked around the dining room and realized that all the patrons were seated together in one section. This made me wonder if they were short staffed. A great way to start our anniversary meal. Service was indeed slow. While ordering, I asked about one dish - herb encrusted salmon. Our waitress described it to me and I ordered it. When it came, it was far from the menu description or what the server told me. I didn't want to make my husband wait so I didn't send it back, but it was disappointing. Then, with our cheesecake, I wanted a cappachino. I asked our server if it was strong or whether I should add a shot of espresso to make it that way. She assured me it was very strong and only Italian men needed the extra shot. The coffee arrived so weak it looked like a few spoonfuls of coffee added to a glass of milk. Worse, it was barely lukewarm. I tried to get her attention before she walked away, but could not. It took quite awhile to get the attention of ANY server. We waited quite awhile for the replacement coffee, which wasn't much better. I didn't send it back, because we were waiting to eat our dessert. Even though they knew I was unhappy with the coffee twice, they did not offer to take it off our bill.  They have some good items on the menu, but the poor service just isn't worth it any more.

610,Elizabeth R.,"Bakersfield, CA",68,59,61.0,3.0,2013-03-24,"Never thought I'd give The Cheesecake Factory a less than 5 star review, but here we are. When my sister and I were leaving Venice Beach with my niece and little brother in tow, we decided to stop by Cheese Factory because we don't have one near us, so we figured, ""Eh, it's on our way home, why not?"" When we got there, we were super hungry, tired from walking around, and looking forward to just sitting, relaxing and having super good food. When we got there, it was valet parking. I've never experienced valet parking at all-let alone at a Cheesecake Factory, although I'm aware it's fancy enough to merit one. Whatever, we're hungry, it's only $5, we pay it.  We get inside, the person taking names and handing out those little buzzers that go off to let you know you can get seated isn't very attentive. In fact, it looks like she doesn't want to be there. She's more concerned with primping. There's another girl standing right next to her who is kind enough to ask us how many in our party, and that triggers the other girl behind the computer to ask my name, tells me it will be a 30 minute wait, and hand me a buzzer. Why they need two girls up front to split that task is beyond me, but at least one of them was pleasant. We finally get seated and our server is so nice! She's on task about giving us refills, asking us if we need anything else, etc. So that was one good part about our meal. I ordered the chicken marsala, and my sister ordered the lemon herb chicken to share with my niece. My little brother ordered the kid's pizza. I've had the chicken marsala at at the Irvine location, and I very much preferred Irvine's. It was juicier, more flavorful and the pasta was al dente. The pasta at the Marina Del Rey locaiton was bowtie, and pretty darn undercooked. Not even al dente. More like, it was 2 minutes away from being al dente.  Unfortunately did not have any cheesecake with our meal because we didn't have any room (the portions are HUGE) and we didn't want to trek back in the car with perishables.

We shared servings of the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes (at Delisa's recommendation, but only available during Sunday brunch) and the California Omelet. Both were delicious, but the pancakes were fluffy, and almost creamy. I know that's weird for a pancake, but it gave a nice tangy flavor along with fluff - amazing.  The omelette, while yummy, was relatively basic. The real star of that dish was the potatoes we got on the side. I know that sounds silly, but they were perfect. Another yummy thing we has was their espresso, which was well made and sweet. One thing that could VASTLY improve this location is their mandatory valet.

I went here last night on a date with my boyfriend and, as usual, we had to valet. I have no problem using a valet and I think it is quite convenient. The valet at the Cheesecake Factory in Manhattan Beach is much more pleasant BTW. After dinner, we both realized we did not have cash. The valet does not take credit cards... this is one of my problems. It is 2013 and accommodating for credit cards is not far-fetched at all. Also, if this is the case, the restaurant should at least have an ATM on hand. However, the valet does not take credit cards and there is no ATM on site. Here is where the valet worker started with his attitude. We simply asked what the option is when people have no cash and he starts yelling about there being an ATM across the street at a liquor store.  After a bit of back and forth trying to figure out where this store was (it was next door around the restaurant), my boyfriend started walking over to the store. I handed over my ticket and after a few seconds I found a $5 bill in my purse. So I figured he would bring the car before the boyfriend would make it to the store anyway and I could pay him and leave. I am waiting alone in the cold at night in a shirt with no sleeves. The man goes over to where the keys are kept and I figure he's getting the car. All this time passes by and still... no car. Even if I was waiting for him to return with cash, they could have brought the car over for me to sit in to the side as I have seen them do before. I ask one of the other attendants where my car is and he just says ""I don't know"" quickly and now takes another two sets of keys from a man that walked out of the restaurant. Their cars come. Mine is still not here. The boyfriend comes back from the store and asks where is the car? I still don't know either. I walk over to them and before I even say anything, the initial man yells ""I am getting it!"" This was so rude and disrespectful. In my attempt to keep my cool, I just shrug it off and say ""well your tip is gone."" My car was finally brought out and now I have to wait behind these other two cars with people who also don't have cash. So I am there for a longer period of time as my car is blocked on both sides. We had such an enjoyable experience in the restaurant with a WONDERFUL waiter and great food. It's unfortunate that the valet is quite the opposite.

246,R H.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,32,1.0,5.0,2013-09-08,"Okay ... so I've been going to Cheesecake Factory for many years now ... and quite frequently too ... once every 2 to 3 weeks ... so you can see I am a fan.  Never bothered to write a review in all these years.  So what prompted me to write this review, you might ask ... well, it was the blunder they made with my last dine-in order.  Blunder? ... and still 5 stars? well, yes ... I think they deserve it. My wife and I went for a dinner last week.  Everything from waiting to seating to order-taking to appetizer service was going well ... till our entrees arrived.  Chicken Bellagio  is originally served with prosciutto.  I don't eat pork so I specifically asked for NO prosciutto.  In fact, although I have Cheesecake Factory's gigantic menu pretty much all memorized, and although I know what menu items have pork and cooking alcohol in them, as a matter of habit, I always mention my waiter that I don't eat pork and can't have any alcohol, so if I order an item that contains either pork or alcohol, please caution me.  That night was no exception. When the dish was served, there was this big slice of prosciutto on top.  When I mentioned that I ordered it without prosciutto, the girl who brought out the food took it right back and told me that they will quickly prepare it again.  Seconds later our waiter was there apologizing and a minute later the manager was at our table side apologizing and offering chowder while I waited for the dish to be prepared again, not knowing that we had already ordered chowder earlier (and it was delicious). Now I can see all this when a customer is visibly upset or loud, but I was neither upset nor did I complain loudly.  I was, for some reason, simply in too good a mood to let anything this small ruin it. I have always enjoyed their food, which I must mention, is always plentiful, and I have always admired their excellent service ... and I look forward to being their customer for a long time. They didn't comp me for the dish.  They didn't comp the dessert either (a slice of tiramisu cheesecake) that my wife and I shared, which I find slightly surprising.  But they still get 5 stars from me for both food and service. PS: I am disappointed on closure of their Brentwood location.  I never dined there but picked up food from there as take-out almost on a weekly basis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=740,3.44,3.47,3.564,3.3480000000000003,3.458

Seating inside and out, both for the most part can see the water and yachts. Of course, because we're in the city of expensive people, they charge for valet parking which is your only option as well.  For lunch on the weekdays, if you are on a rush, it may not be a good idea. During the weekdays, they are typically short on staff so service is not speedy. On the weekends, the staff is plentiful but expect a 1-2 hour wait. Since my first time dining at Cheesecake, I have been a huge fan of their pasta selection. But now that I've grown older and become more fonder of other foods, my new favorite is the Miso Salmon.  They have a lunch special in their main menu (Miso Salmon is included) which is a steal for~$12. Portions are very generous and I was stuffed halfway into my entrée. I can only imagine how big the dinner size is. I also pair my lunch with their delicious strawberry lemonade. Sometimes sour and sometimes sweet, but I keep ordering it.

There are puddles on the floor or at the very least a quarter inch of water on the floor, along with some toilet paper and other miscellaneous things.  Food: The portions are really big so one plate will feed 2-4 people. I don't know if I would try anything off the menu, its just not the tastiest food.

The views from inside and outside the restaurant are spectacular, being right off the marina. However, we weren't pleased that parking was only valet and we were basically yanked out of our car by pushy valet staff. In my personal opinion, I believe valet parking should be more of a choice and not a MUST. But, I'll just let that go. We arrived at 5pm and were seated at about 5:20pm - so overall, not too long of a wait, especially for a Sunday night. Our waitress was extremely friendly but forgot about us when a party of twenty was seated next to us. Our waitress took our drink orders and didn't return until we needed boxes and a check. (Probably would've given five stars, if the service was a little better.) But aside from the service, the food was outstanding. Everyone loved their dishes - myself especially. I ordered the mushroom burger (and I know, Cheesecake Factory isn't normally where you would order a burger, but it was my birthday, so whatever) and it was DELICIOUS. I highly highly highly recommend it.

Upon arrival, we were forced to valet park, $4.50 charge. The attendant said self park or valet, you still have to pay the fee. Ripoff.  The dining room was a little crowded so, we decided to self seat in the bar area. Our server arrived promptly to take our drink order and asked about an appetizer before we even opened our menus. I love quick service but, we felt rushed.  We passed on a appetizer because my bud is doing the whole P90X thing so, he's watching his food intake. We ordered our entrees and they arrived quickly. Before we even took our first bite, the server was there like flies on dung, asking how everything turned out. I really didn't have an answer for her, being that my fork was still wrapped in my napkin. I had the orange chicken with brown rice. The chicken alone was delicious. The rice was dry, I had to ask for soy sauce to rehydrate it. Which was a task to get because the server walked passed us about 4 times before I finally grabbed her eye. My bud had the turkey and avocado sandwich, not a crumb was left on his plate so, I'm assuming he liked it. Our server didn't hover, which I appreciate but, after she dropped the check, she was never seen again. I had to walk up to the bar top to have her run our payments. So our experience was meh.

There is always a huge crowd in the lobby area.  People LOVE this place right?!!!  We were seated immediately but that was when it got fun. If you know this place then allow me to guide you to the inside dining area, where there is this two-top table pushed up against the wall and positioned about 12 inches from a real table, a 4-top.  This table setting seems like an after thought, as if the manager said lets up our sales and squeeze a table into this space.  We asked to be seated elsewhere, to not be made to feel like a step child that  is amongst the favorite children people.  We were seated at the other side of the inside dining area.  And there we sat.   And sat.  And sat.  And sat.  The servers walked by us.  Every single one of them.  And you know how many people walk by the homeless and don't make eye contact?  Don't acknowledge their presence?  Yep, that was us.   Then finally Brittaney/Elizabeth, I can't remember who, gently walked up to our table and whispered if we had been helped.  No.  And she did.  Yay!  We were enjoying our complimentary bread, again, yay and then the appetizer of Spinach Dip came out.  Cold.  It's okay if it's a cold app but when there's cheese involved, the app should be served warm, very warm.  But we endured because as a step child we didn't want to get too loud. Then, dum-dum-dum!  The manager walks up and politely asks if we could move because we were seated at a reserved table.  There was no reserved sign but whatever. We moved to the booth a few feet away and enjoyed our meal.  I had the Jambalaya and it was great but honestly I got full with the app and bread.

I tried the southern fried catfish with mashed potatoes, corn, and green beans.  The catfish was very dark in color, but inside it was cooked just right, not dry.  The portions of the sides seemed a bit modest.  I remember when Cheesecake Factory portions were known to be rather huge...Not anymore.  The catfish was adequate with three pieces, but the sides did seem skimpy.

I called to make a reservation for 12 people for lunch on a Friday. After taking all my information, the woman said she had to confirm with the manager that it was ok to take the reservation. So then she comes back to me and said the manager said that they only take group lunch reservations from Mon-Thurs. I know that my same work group has eaten with a reservation for that many people on a Friday so this must be a new policy. Her alternative solution was to come a half an hour early and wait for a table. Well, the whole point of not waiting when you have a big party like that is why we make a reservation.

However, something about this location tries to make this Cheesecake Factory seem like you're dining at the freaking Ivy. It's so full of pretension, I wouldn't be surprised if the valet attendants judge you by the kind of vehicle you drive.  Oh, Valet! Why in the world is it necessary to valet your car for an establishment that contains an open and large lot? I learned how to park a very long time ago and I certainly don't mind taking the few extra minutes to make it happen vs paying someone else to do it. Having the option is one thing, but forcing everyone to valet is quite another. I guess it all boils down to the view, which, don't get me wrong, is pretty damn awesome if you're able to sit some place where you can actually appreciate it. And even then, you'll be so starved from waiting over an hour to be seated that your eyes will probably be fixated on the delicious bread basket.  Service here is fine. Food is fine. The menu is VAST and will probably take you about 20 minutes to get through. I like variety and options, though, so I'm not complaining too much. To me, Cheesecake Factories are best in malls. You almost always have an insane wait, so having it located in a mall makes killing time before the meal a breeze. While the view here is amazing, it is probably the only amazing thing you'll be experiencing during your visit. That and the amazing amount of calories you just consumed in one slice of that thawed out cheesecake.

The consideration that we take into account is, can we stand the wait.  Which is usually 25-60min. on average.  Do I really feel like dealing with the crowded reception booth that everyone stands around like they have the winning lotto.   The food is good and I absolutely come here solely for some outside dining and the Cajun Jambalaya which I find to be a grand cheat meal.  The flavors in it are awesome. I came here for my birthday once and the waiter just brought out this tiny sample cup of ice cream...that's it but another table got a birthday song and a slice of cheesecake.  : - O The wait staff are a crap shoot.  Some people are great at what they do and some just need  a job (I get it).  I tip accordingly so, when your service surprises me, I surprise you but when I'm asking myself questions like, ""did that just happen"", I'm checking off.  I have a problem with people that lack people skills, working in the service industry.  Even though I come here for the food and the ambiance there are some things that get in the way of that fulfilling experience of dining out. I gave two stars for the ambiance alone.  Some days its nice to spend a couple hours on the bike path and then head over to CCF afterward. The bar seating is a bit crowded but not overwhelming and the TVs are kind of high on the wall and there is no sound when watching the game.  Not ideal but if you find yourself there, it's doable if you don't want to miss a particular game.   Biggest Con:  That tiny ass bathroom that always need a tiding up.  Two stalls? TH Sometimes I just hold it.   The last few times we have ordered our food to go on our way there because they expect a tip if you order from your car and they bring it out.  Naaaay, I can walk in a pay, no problem.  They always forget your condiments even when you ask for them in advance like, bread no butter and sometimes utensil.  They'll double check your food order but it's up to you to make sure you have the extras you requested. Overall: I will still come here from time to time but 9-10 it will be for take out on a cheat day.  They are not the worst",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=500,2.92,3.32,3.484,2.412,3.16

I usually like a1 with my mashed potatoes she never came back for me to ask. We are nice enough to not complain but we sat there with our well done steaks and empty drinks ( we wanted more drinks $ ) and she only came by to ask us if we wanted boxes.

This time, I was craving carbonara the other night so my boyfriend suggested coming here because he loves The Cheesecake Factory.   The Marina del Rey location was the closest to my apartment.  Driving in, there is only valet, which costs $4.50 during dinner.  There seemed to be a lot of people outside, so we asked the valet if it was a busy night.  He told us not really and that the wait seemed to be only about 10 minutes, but when we walked inside the hostess told us about 30 minutes. x.x  We decided to wait because we had our mind set on pasta.   The hostess was not very friendly, which was kind of a turn off for my first impression of the restaurant.  Also, the bathroom was pretty dirty for such a pretty restaurant.  There was trash everywhere and the ground was wet.  It didn't seem like anyone came in to clean the restroom often.   We decided to wait at the bar and grab a few drinks at the bar before dinner.  He had a classic mojito and I had the pink lemonade cocktail, as suggested by the bartender. They were both delicious! Mind did not even taste like alcohol, but you could tell they were both strong.  We ended up getting seated in about 15 minutes so we had to take our drinks with us to the table.  We sat outside on the patio and it was so beautiful! You are right on the water under a cascade of beautiful lights.  Since it's summer, the weather was perfect and we asked our server to lower the heat lamps above us.  The setting was perfect.   To start the meal, the freshly baked bread was hot and delicious.  The wheat and honey bread was fantastic.  We also had an order of calamari for our appetizer.  It was crispy and came with marinara sauce and some type of creamy sauce.  For our entrees, we ordered the chicken carbonara and the cajun jambalaya pasta.  They were both tasty.  The jambalaya pasta wasn't too spicy and came with both chicken and shrimp.  The carbonara was the perfect consistency; not too heavy.  To finish our meal, we ordered the Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake.  There were oreos baked in the cheesecake and it was layered with some type of fudge cake and some type of milky icing.  It was topped with a giant oreo cookie! I normally do not care for cheesecake, but this one had a good amount of chocolate to make me happy ^.^",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=300,3.96,3.28,3.46,3.3120000000000003,3.552

It was my sister-in-law's birthday so the whole family went out for dinner (Party of 11; 3 of them are kids). It was only a Wednesday night and yet we were told that it was a 1 hr wait for an outdoor patio table. Ok, 1 hr seemed long but doable so we waited. And waited... And waited. Then my husband said, ""Oh wait. That couple leaving...Didn't we wait when they waited?"" We then realized we waited for 2 friggin hrs! So we went inside just hungry and tired of waiting, and they claimed they still didn't have a table ready for us. Since we already invested so much time in waiting, we stayed but had to call the head manager. After we spoke to the manager all of a sudden a table was ready for us. But they were very apologetic to us and our waiter apologized to us profusely as well. The food also took awhile to arrive as well. We were a large party, however, the restaurant was emptying out since it was getting late. Aside from the long wait of waiting for out table and food, everything was great. Thankfully!

735,Aaron M.,"Los Angeles, CA",76,48,1.0,1.0,2014-07-24,"There are a couple uncomfortable things you can do when you work in a restaurant that will make not only a bad, but akward experience for a customer. Employees fighting, people that man the phones taking personal calls in front of customers etc. I found out another one last night when My GF and I went to this place around 930 for dinner. It was busy so they quoted a half hour wait but did say there was open seating at the bar...we saw two people get up so we figured if there was a full menu it would do. We sat down and their were two bartenders working, one stocky guy with a beard that was going a mile a minute and a young looking asian girl who was barely doing anything. Took about 10 mins to be acknowledged and then got our drinks placed next to the previous customers dirty plates (asked if he could clear it for us and was met with the response of ""will get to that in one second""). After we got our food we might as well have been invisible, needed a couple of things (tobasco, salt and pepper) and had to ask one of the waiters walking by, he looked annoyed and shouted at the bartender to come over and help us. The thing that made it akward was we kept noticing the girl bartender talking to two other patrons for most of our visit and ignoring pretty much everyone and everything else. We didn't put two and two together till she started EATING off the peoples plate and other employees kept stopping by and saying hi to them. It was then obvious that these were other employees on there off time and the bartender was better served eating with them and talking about how she had gone here and there the night before then making sure we had condiments for our food. This went on for literally the entire hour we were eating, my GF kept looking at me in shock like ""they are really carrying on and we can't even get our card run so we can leave"". Some places do not allow employees to fraternize at work in their off hours, I never agreed with that but there is a fine line where professionalism is lost because you want to BS with your co worker...this is not good practice in the restaurant business. The food was very good, but we got the basic apps and a piece of cheescake (kind of hard to F%$k that up). One star for the food but the rest was as bad as I've seen in a while, unfortunately will probably go back because they do serve food late...will just make sure to sit in the dining room this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=680,3.96,3.28,3.428,2.9480000000000004,3.552
616,Clayton C.,"Dallas, TX",21,158,17.0,3.0,2014-07-29,"Let me preface this review by saying that I don't like The Cheesecake Factory, and we only went because we had a $50 gift card and two gift cards for a free slice of cheesecake each.  It turned out at the end of the night that we only had $17 left on the gift card, and the free cheesecakes expired in 2012.  Oops. The food is good.  It's not splendid, and I can't imagine it's healthy, but it's good.  The bread is delicious.  The service was good.  I just felt terrible at the end of the night that I was spending $80 (plus tip) on fairly plain food, and then walked outside to pay $4.50 (plus tip) in a mandatory valet lot. We ordered a lot of food (thinking at the time that we had a lot of free money to spend. Oops.).  Here's what we had: - Ahi tuna tartare (pretty good, but pretty small for $6.95) - Chicken and mushroom lettuce wraps (nothing special, and as with all lettuce wrap dishes ever, too much lettuce, not enough filling) - Steak salad (probably has a better name, but that's what it is - should have guessed that it would be swimming in dressing) - Lemon garlic shrimp (the shrimp were big, but the best thing my wife can say is ""there was nothing wrong with it"", which means that she can make it better) - Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic (the best dish of the night - quite tasty, but still probably fairly unhealthy) - Kahlua cheesecake (I've never seen it offered anywhere else, so it's definitely unique, but I'd love to have more flavor) - White chocolate raspberry cheesecake (they didn't have the chocolate raspberry, which was literally the only thing we were looking forward to - this one is an ok back-up, but just ok) So yeah, it's a lot of food.  Don't worry, we didn't eat it all in one sitting.  But in my mind, despite the good service, and the ok food, it's way too expensive for just ok food, especially in the food mecca that is Los Angeles.  And please, please, if valet is mandatory, don't make it $4.50.

We got there at about 6:30 but we were not actually seated until 8:30. I know that cheesecake does not take reservations but the least they can do is put heating lamps outside for the people waiting for their seat. Even during summer nights, given the location, it get chilly after 7:00pm. Now the reason why I decided to overlook the long and cold wait is because of the excellent service. The first waiter was amazing and patient while 6 indecisive girls took their sweet time ordering. He accommodated all our requests and adjustments to our meals. Afterwards, we asked if we can close that tab at that table and move near the fire pits for desert. When we got there we realized that the waiter serving near the fire pits needed to leave as his shift was over and they would no longer be serving in that area. However, after we explained to him that it was my birthday, he was willing to stay and serve us even if it meant working when he didn't have to.

They need to make a Cheesecake Factory to-go. That might be impossible with the extensive menu, but... I just wanna have a slice of cheesecake delivered to me. Despite the chain's reputation for having high-caloric, fat-filled, carb-loaded dishes, they do have a good amount of healthy options. The Thai chicken lettuce wraps were huge (although there could be more chicken...) and the chopped veggie salad was just okay. And if you're going to a factory of cheesecake, it becomes a duty to have a slice. I tried the macadamia nut caramel cheesecake, something I wouldn't normally get, but it was really good! The crust is sticky sweet, and the crunchy macadamia nuts balance out that thick, oozy caramel. They split the cheesecake in half for us... but, I think I prefer sharing the slice on one plate. That way, I can either eat it all.. or just a bite.. depending if I like it or not. I mean, because its more romantic to have it one plate obviously.

We asked for patio seating and were told it would be a 30-minute wait.  They gave us one of their buzzer light-up devices and we took a table in the bar, about 15 feet away from the front desk. We waited 10 minutes for a waiter to take our drink order, and when he did, he acted as though it was the last place on earth he wanted to be.  We paid the check and waited to be called for a table. And waited. And waited.  A full hour later we approached the desk and were told that our device was defective and that they had called out the name of our party several times. Remember, we were only about 15 feet away. And there were five of us. Not one of us heard the page. I approached a manger who was all loosey goosey about it. ""Oh yeah well, we're waiting for a party to leave so you can sit.""  I went back to the bar and another manager came out and apologized profusely. He said they had paged us FIVE MINUTES AFTER WE ARRIVE!  So in theory, we could have just about been done eating our dinner by the time they finally addressed our problem.  We were then seated at a lovely table on the patio.  The food was good but the birthday spirit had deflated by then.

I had been told that if I got there at 530p ahead of the party, that we could be seated at 7p when the rest of the party was to arrive.  When I got there around 550p I was told differently. The manager, Chris, came over to me and explained the situation. Even though he couldn't change the amount of time it would take to be seated inside the restaurant (2 hours from the moment the whole party had arrived! Since guest were to arrive at 7, that meant 9p!) he did offer a solution. He was able to open up a space on the water called the beachfront seating. He lit up the firepit, opened the side curtains of a big booth, and turned on the heat lamps to make the area more inviting as it was currently not being used due to the season (fall is upon us). When the guests arrived at 7p everyone was pleasantly surprised with the pretty view on the water. We didn't have a waiter and had to order our food at the bar or to go (which we then took outside to eat) but everyone had somewhere to sit and food to eat.

We were starving but the appetizers came after the entrees did. The pastas we were ordered were pretty bland. We came to celebrate 2 birthdays. They usually offer complimentary ice-cream sundaes to you if you have a birthday, but if you want the free sundae, DO NOT buy a cheesecake for dessert. We bought 4 cheesecakes and were not offered the sundaes because we bought the cheesecakes. However, their policy is, if you don't buy a cheesecake, then they will give you the free sundae. Very odd logic to me, since, if we had known this ahead of time, we would not have bought the cheesecakes. Customers should be rewarded for buying their cheesecakes, not for NOT buying them. When the cheesecakes arrived, we also didn't have any knives for a long time and had to use our forks to cut them. The cheesecakes were not particularly good and just tasted greasy.

They were pretzel-breaded chicken on skewers and came with two different dipping sauces - unsure what exactly what kind they were but both tasted like different kinds of honey mustard and had good flavors For dinner: I had the Pasta Da Vinci - penne pasta with chicken, mushroom and onion in a Madeira Sauce. I thought the pasta was a little too oily for my taste and the proportions were not well balanced - there was very little chicken, mushroom and onion compared to the overwhelming amount of penne pasta.  In addition, my pasta was not consistent - in the sea of penne pasta, i found 1 spaghetti noodle, 1 macaroni elbow and 1 farfalle pasta.  Don't get me wrong, it didnt bother me at all and I ate them gladly but as a critical perspective of the restaurant, I think that seeing how this is a farily nice chain restaurant, there are certain standards that should be met and upheld.  This just seems like there is no quality control in the kitchen.  For dessert: I had the Smore's cheesecake, which I took to go since I was already so full - tried some the next day and it was excellent! I love all kinds of cheesecake though and especially chocolate so my opinion may be biased.   Service: I thought it was passable - our waitress did the bare minimum - got our orders correct, but she didn't ask in the middle of our entree how we were doing or if the food was ok.   Parking: it's Valet only and at night it costs $4.50 which I think is kind of a rip off  but then again it's Marina Del Rey so it was expected.  However, the valet attendant was driving with not the most extreme care with my car - when he was driving to pull up, he ran into a orange cone and it dragged in the front of my car for about a few feet before he realized what was wrong.  Even though there was no damage to the car, I was pretty pissed because I'm paying for a service that I don't need since I'm capable of parking my own car and also entrusting my car in the hands of someone else, which they failed to do so with care.   Probably won't come back here again because there's other good restaurants worth while eating at but the view outside was nice since it looked out of the Marina.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=360,3.32,3.58,3.416,2.7960000000000003,3.4760000000000004

I don't necessarily come here for the food but more for their cheesecake.

37,Vic C.,"Duarte, CA",107,2377,8717.0,3.0,2015-03-24,"I generally think food at Cheesecake Factory is good (well depending on what you order), although I have had some items that were pretty disappointing. But anyways, I came to this Cheesecake Factory on a Tuesday for lunch with my husband.  Not being familiar with Marina Del Rey or this location, we were surprised to see that we had to pay for parking (bummer to that and wished this restaurant would provide free parking since we are spending money at this business). But anyways, after we entered the restaurant, we were greeted by the hostess and seated at a table (with a nice outside view of the water). After looking over the menu, we got: Shrimp with Angel Hair- The portion of this entree was rather large and plenty for 2 people to share. The noodles were cooked a little to long, as they were a little bit on the soft (almost mushy) side. The shrimp itself tasted good but wished there were more of it. The creamy sauce itself was good, but oily (typical of restaurant fare).  Renee's Special- this lunch special comes with you choice of half a sandwich of either chicken almond salad or turkey. I opted for turkey and asked for it to be served on mustard instead of mayonnaise. This lunch special also comes with a cup of soup and a side of salad, which is quite a bit of food. The soup I had was tomato bisque and it was really nice and creamy and also served warm. But because the salad was served on the same plate as the soup and sandwich, a good part of it was already wilted by the time it got to my table. The turkey sandwich itself was pretty standard.  Service was just average. Our water glasses were refilled only once during our visit. We were checked on twice during our visit.  Overall, there isn't really anything special or unique about this visit, compared to our dining experiences at other Cheesecake Factory locations. Really the only reason you would want to come to Cheesecake Factory is for the cheesecake and their other desserts on the menu are pretty good as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=200,3.12,3.47,3.392,2.668,3.33
163,Anna G.,"Chatsworth, CA",388,464,253.0,3.0,2015-03-28,"So I decided to pull a Ferris Bueller last Tuesday and ditched work to spend the day with my best friends from out of town. One of our stops was Cheesecake Factory as we decided to pregame before dinner. I stuck to our plan and ordered light to save room for our real dinner but they decided to go on the heavier route reassuring me that they would still have room for dinner. Just a lil tidbit on our friendship..it revolves around food. Since our UCLA days we've been major foodies and made it our mission to eat. We plan our days around food and manage to out-eat everyone around us...including our 200+ pound boyfriends.  We stopped by a little after 5 which sucked since we missed their lunch menu but I was planning on ordering off their small plates menu so I didn't care too much. We were able to get seated right away and found a great spot outside, I can't really say much about their food because it's a chain restaurant and every Cheesecake has the same menu. This particular location has a great view which is just an added bonus to their already affordable prices and generous portions. I have recently been hooked on their Asian lettuce tacos and that did it for me as far as pre-dinner went. We ordered the avocado rolls for appetizers and the food tasted right, as I would expect it to.  I was not thrilled about having to valet and pay $5/$6 to have someone park my car a few feet away from the restaurant but it makes sense to charge since it is a beach. If the parking was free then everyone would park there. I don't really have complaints about my experience but the one thing that I can mention is that my friend and I were almost done with our food before my other friend received hers. I had the tacos, Jeannette had pasta, and Fatima's fried chicken(off the menu apparently) didn't make it to the table till I was pretty much done with my meal. Hey..at least I was able to get a piece of her chicken lol.

He said nothing about hitting our car and just ran away. Luckily he didn't do any damage to our car so I just left. Don't trust your cars with Valet.

It's decent food that is seemingly over priced. My sone had the grilled pork chop for $20 at lunch. I had the plain $10 Cesar Salad, was good I mean how can you mess up a Cesar right?  Service was outstanding, people were really busing their  A$$. We had been seated next to the kitchen though, pretty noisy with dishes banging but what are you going to do? The worst part about the place, aside from the crowd and wait is the restaurant set up. You have to walk through the kitchen/serving area to get to the seats. Then if you have to goto the restroom you travel back through that area. All in all the experience was ok, the food was decent but well over priced. The service was amazing.

The waiter NEVER BROUGHT bread. He didn't  offer any either. 5. There were flies buzzing about  6. The chicken tasted like the frozen kind I keep in my refrigerator. The shrimp was mushy ( Jamaican black pepper chicken and shrimp) Ive been ordering the exact same item for  12-15 years. Creature of habit. 7. Our waiter may have been new. He left a lot to be desired-  when it comes to customer service. We never got our receipt and to top it off, I had to ask him for my husbands credit card because he forgot it at the cashier area.

The beachside seating has an amazing view and ambiance that can't be beat. This is one of the few MDR restaurants that has stood the test of time. The only downside is they don't take reservations at all, so during busy times the wait can be significant. I'm also not a fan of forced valet parking. Even if you choose to park the car yourself, you still have to pay the valet fee.  The menu is fantastic, with something for everyone. The portions are huge, so be ready to leave with a takeout bag. I love the breakfast section of the menu for Sunday brunch. If you're like me, you'll find a favorite menu item and get it every time.

520,Bethany P.,"Los Angeles, CA",147,56,58.0,3.0,2015-07-07,"Arriving into the Cheesecake Factory the valet seemed very eager to take our money before we even parked. My dad assured him we were going to park first then pay. BTW parking is like $5. We were seated in a booth area and our waitress came over. She seemed really stressed and seemed like she was having a terrible day. My mom has a food allergy to mushrooms and we ordered a pizza and 20 mins later the pizza arrives by a different waitress covered in mushrooms! Whether it was the waitress or one of the chefs who didn't get the order correct it wasn't a big issue we just asked the woman who gave us the pizza to please remake it. Our original waitress came back and this time she seemed like she had real attitude when my mother asked to please make sure they didn't just pick the mushrooms off and then bring it back out (sorry these things happen....). Instead of seeming sympathetic she sort of got aggressive and kept saying something like ""we all know"" already when my mom asked why the pizza had mushrooms on it. Then she condescendingly at the end of one of her remarks called my mother ""honey"" or ""hon"". And so it began.... Food: My parents ordered the Mediterranean Salmon which came with potatoes and artichokes and tomatoes. They said their food was very good. From what I saw it looked good and the portions were huge! I ordered the SKINNYLICIOUS® Fresh Vegetable Salad. I noticed it said pomegranate dressing which seemed new to me so I tried it. I love pomegranates and I know how they taste so when my salad came out it looked good and I had a couple bites but knew something was off. Every bite I took the dressing tasted like car motor oil. Of course I've never tasted car oil but it had that weird aroma too it. idk how to describe and when you would try to wash it down with some water it would burn. I'm usually not too picky but at this point we agreed it would be better to request for a new one since I was ready to puke. After a while the manager came out and was super nice! He is the reason why I am adding on another star. He apologized to my mom and gave us a complementary corn soup which was super delicious. He was very humble and attentive unlike the waitress who was agitated at that point. The new salad that they gave me was great and I got balsamic vinaigrette on the side I recommend that or at least taste test whatever the hell they put on the salad. Overall this salad tasted amazing and fresh the second time around! After some time the waitress came back and asked how the salad was and I told her it tasted way better. Of course at this point everyone in my family was tense and I just wanted to go home. Since it was my mom's birthday we ordered 3 cheesecakes. 2 raspberry lemon ones and one chocolate one. That experience went smoothly at least there was some moment of positivity with all the chaos. The cheesecake was great too! We didn't finish all our food so our waitress came back and was struggling bagging everything and later when we got home the corn soup was spilled all over the bag....Also good luck getting water in this place...I had to track down like 3 men to fill up the glasses of water. They were super chill though and service was fast on that.  I just want to thank the manager so much for stepping in and helping resolve the conflicts. I've worked in food before and understand the frustration with people, orders, and tension but man what a buzzkill to someone's birthday -_- Thank god we had a $75 gift card here because the food came out to about $100 not including tip and for the experience it was not worth it! I hope some of that tip makes it way to the manager he was awesome!

First off just like others mentioned this place was jam packed it was Saturday and we found out later there was an event nearby. We were surprised when they said there wouldn't be a wait but we soon realized it was because they were giving us a small table off the side with heavy traffic. The seats were so close together felt like we were part of a big party rather than dinner for two. Our server was slow taking our order our drinks took long he couldn't get my husband a second beer before he finished the rest of his food. He said he'd get a manager to find out what was happening at bar we never heard back. We didn't even order dessert at our table because we knew it would take too long we figured we'd order and pay for it at the dessert station before we left which was another chaos people standing around everywhere waiters squeezing through people bumping you no space to stand without having to move for someone else to get by.

The Cheesecake Factory MDR hands-down runs the best take-out operation I have seen anywhere. No matter how busy the restaurant is, and no matter what I order, they food is always ready on time. They can turn out almost anything in 15 minutes or less. So many restaurants completely drop the ball on take-out when they are busy, but not The Cheesecake Factory. The food is also well-packaged, and I have never had a problem with order accuracy. They also have four or five dedicated take-out parking spaces which makes it super-easy to get in and out.

There was an hour wait, which I guess would be normal for a Sunday night but I have never waited more than about 20 minutes here, ever!  So it's my birthday and Mother in Law wanted to take me out, so I suggested the usual Cheesecake Factory as I do every year!  So after the horrendous wait, we get seated and told the ""specials"" from the server filling in for the normal server.  I order the salmon special and my husband and mom order their meals.  About ten minutes in and the lights dimmed so much we are all amused at the fact that we can barely see each other and the table next to us is passing around a cell phone with their flashlight on to read the menu.  I'm now told from the normal server that she is so sorry but they are out of salmon!  So I ask to see the menu again and quickly decide on a pasta from the heading because at this point I can't read what is under it due to the lighting.... I ask her what is a good past with a white sauce that I can take out the meat?  So I decide on Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic... And please hold the chicken. Totally put on pressure to pick something else quickly. Now I don't eat meat but I do eat fish, so I ask to hold the chicken.  I get my meal and start eating.  What am I chewing on cause I can't see my food? I put my flashlight on and it's covered in pancetta.  Apparently in small print there's pancetta.  I waive down the server and she apologizes that she did not think to ask if pancetta would be okay when I asked to hold the chicken.  (Assuming someone would be vegetarian when asking to hold meat).  So okay my fault, she takes it back to be remade without meat.  I get my new meal. IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME! Covered in meat again! The server apologizes over and over and sends for another meal. By this time my husband and mom are finished eating and waiting on me.  We have now been there about two and a half hours.  I've picked at the bread and spinach dip enough that I'm now full.  So we ask for boxes and a check.  Come to find....

165,Charles M.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,162,15.0,3.0,2016-04-24,"Back in the day this was the place to go.  Being from LA, I've been to this Cheesecake Factory to celebrate someone's birthday quite a few times.  So recently I decided to take someone here for their b-day. 1.  First of all they don't take reservations.  I think management does this on purpose so if they are fully booked, people might go elsewhere... instead patrons' only option is to get there and put there name down and depending on how busy it is, just wait.  Read the other reviews.  This stinks for big groups.  Granted the staff working there are pretty good. (If you really want to eat at a Cheesecake Factory, the Santa Monica one said they did take reservations during weekdays at their non-peak hours.) 2.  Eating outside.  If it's near dinner time it might seem like a good idea to eat outside.  Especially when we were offered seating immediately on their patio.  I sat with the sun in my face and tried to move the umbrellas over to get some shade but that didn't help much.   Then when the sun set it got windy and cold.  We did ask them to turn on the heat lamp so that helped.   3.  The view here is pretty nice.  This is my favorite Cheesecake Factory. 4.  Prices on their menu.  I noticed on their menu, for some reason they don't list prices on most of their drinks (other than wine) and their cheesecake.  We ordered the Salted Caramel cheesecake and it was 7.95. 5.  The food here has never been that amazing or memorable but it's definitely above average.  The portion sizes are decent and it seems like everyone is taking leftovers home. On my most recent  visit we did order a salad, the Spicy Cashew Chicken and their steak and salmon combo.  The salad was good, the steak and salmon were fine as well but the Spicy Cashew Chicken has issues. I think they rushed the order and they didn't cook off the alcohol from the sauce. (I know when I follow a recipe for teriyaki sauce they use either a sake or mirin but when I tried the Spicy Cashew Chicken the alcohol flavor was way too much.) I ended up eating my friend's dish and most of the break. (The bread is pretty darn good... I'm pretty sure they're extra sugar in the warm wheat bread. 6.  Cheesecake.  If you don't thoroughly enjoy the meal (like we did) be sure to get some cheesecake.  We had the Salted Caramel Cheesecake and that was pretty amazing. That pretty much saved the night and we left happy.   So if you decide to visit a Cheesecake Factory, make sure you leave room for dessert. 7.  Valet Parking.  I think the sign said Mon-Thu for Lunch - $3.50, and any other time is $5. I went in late April 2016 so it might change. If you do decide to go to the Cheesecake at Marina Del Ray, keep in mind the food isn't the best, you'll likely wait, but the desserts and the view alone is worth a visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=340,3.48,3.14,3.248,2.476,3.2760000000000007

The staff is super nice...very polite and courteous. My party and I waited 10 minutes to be seated. We were seated in the patio, giving us a priceless view of Mother's Beach.  The amount of items on the menu here are endless! Out of a zillon things, I ordered the Fried Shrimp Sandwich. The flavor from the sriracha aoli gave the sandwich a nice spicy kick. The shrimp was absolutely crispy and buttery. It was very delicious!  The cheesecakes are TO DIE FOR! I have almost tried every cheesecake here (and lived to write this review...lol.) I can say there is no better cheesecakes made out there (and sold at any restaurants or stores) that could be any better than what the Cheesecake Factory offers...unless you are in NYC.

I really wish they didn't take away my sun-dried tomato chicken fettuccine.  Got the arugula fig flat bread. Pretty filling!  Their portions are huge.

618,erin w.,"Chicago, IL",6,9,2.0,1.0,2016-06-26,"Last night was probably the most horrific experience that I have ever had at this restaurant. After getting done enjoying my dinner and getting ready to leave I was in a panic when I discovered that my purse was missing. I literally placed it hanging on my chair while sitting there enjoying my dinner. I did not leave the table once and yet my purse was still snachted from me. The only people walking by our table was the staff members. Our server was as helpful as she could be. I was extremely upset that this could happen. Fortunately, I was able to use the track my iPhone app on my boyfriends phone. Which showed that it was in the restaurant.  I was walking around the restaurant for about an hour and half. When I stated to one of the managers that it was located in the restaurant he was very uninterested.  I also asked if there was a higher manager then him which he informed there wasn't. That wasn't the truth at all I found out shortly later. I requested the manager to call the local police authority which he did not. This mangager was refusing to be helpful in this whole situation.  Then the general manager Steven came over to talk to us he was more then helpful. He actually walked around for about 30 mins with us trying to track my phone that was located in my missing purse. And what do you know all of sudden it was turned in. I couldn't believe it. I was happy when my server found it and brought it back to me. But after all that someone finally turned it in. But of course all the cash that was in my purse was gone. I had about $60-70 cash in it. I can't help but think an employee finally decided to turn it after they took the cash out. I really think one of the employees at the restaurant actually stole my purse and took the cash. They must have gotten nervous when I asked for the police to be contacted. I can't believe after such an awful experience that my dinner was not refunded. I am completely appalled by this whole situation. I can no longer continue to be a paying patron here. I feel completely taken advantage of after being ripped off by an employee. The whole situation was just a shady experience. I was a regular customer that would attend here at least twice a month.

On Sunday July 17, 2016, my girlfriend , her mother and I went to the Cheesecke Factory. We were there at 7:15. We were told it would be a 40 minute wait for seating, however, we didn`t sit till an hour later. We were understanding because it was a Sunday night and that is one of their busiest days. My girlfriends mother uses a walker and when we were escorted to our CORNER, we asked if we could sit 2 spots away from us where the seats were available to acomodate the 3 of us. ( Please be aware that she has a fold away walker and not a wheelchair.) The person said no, we need to sit at the corner. At this point, the 3 of us felt we were discriminated especially because nobody sat at the other table for another 10 minutes later. So it was available. Yes, the table was clean and ready for customers to sit, we checked. After sitting at the table which was really cramped up, we felt very uncomfortable. Example, there were unopened unbrella posts and round umbrella basses which were disallowing my girlfriend to sit comfortably. I asked for the manager, he pulled the table back a few inches. This really did not solve the issue. The right thing to do was to , even if we needed to wait a few moments, was to change tables. Manager did not do his job. After UNCOMFORTABLY sitting, we ordered food and instead of trying to make us feel better the manager brought out bread and 3 little packets of butter. THAT IS JUST GREAT, WE ALL GOT 1 EACH. SO GENEROUS!!!!!!  Anyhow, moving right along, I go to Cheesecake Factory in other locations and always get the eggplant parm and all waitresses and waiters till now ask me if I want cheese on it. My waiter did not and this was not an issue for me at all. The issue here is, instead of making things better it got worse. I asked him for the grated cheese and he said he`ll get it. I turned over to my girlfried and said to her ""I BET YOU HE`LL EITHER FORGET OR BRING IT WHEN I`M DONE WITH MY FOOD"". Guess what.... I WON THE BET!!!! When I was down to my 1/4 piece of eggplant out of the 5 or 6 pieces they give you, he showed up. I looked at him and i said ""TELL ME YOUR JOKING""!!!!!!

I mean stuffed!!!! It was garnished with salsa, guacamole and pickled onions and other stuff that tastes oh, so good! I couldn't even finish it all! Nicky was also accommodating enough to let me sample their housemate Sangria. Wow...it was tasty! Delicious notes of cinnamon and fruit throughout. I would've ordered a glass of I wasn't driving. Will get it next time.  After our amazing lunch, we grabbed the black out cake and strawberry cheesecake to go. The blackout cake was decadent. Dark chocolate, fudge, dense and moist...like...the ultimate chocolate make everything better cake. Again, I didn't finish all of my cake. I gave it to my daughter who feverishly inhaled it.

It is five dollars for valet (I was able to self park because I arrived before lunch crowd and it is cheap compared to other beachside parking lots) It was a pleasant way to end a fabulous lunch. This is definitely a place to go for whatever you fancy. They can accommodate and everyone is very attentive. My glass of strawberry lemonade never got empty because they were so on top of things. I even took the time to thank them via the online feedback from my receipt and got myself 5 bucks to use again...please trust...it will be used on my return trip.

I'm a vegetarian so I thought maybe they were cooked in oil which was used to fry other items and contaminated. However, my coworker also felt sick and she eats meat so either we had a bad batch or they were simply bad somehow. Nonetheless, we were a big party/event of 65+ we sat on the patio which was wonderful with a view of the marina. For an entrée I ordered the Chinese salad w/out chicken. It was satisfactory nothing extravagant, but not bad. We also had sweet potato fries which were good. Overall, I'd say the food quality is a 2 to 2.5 for vegetarians as options are limited. My coworkers enjoyed their food though so I'm going to give it a 3 rating.

So we ordered a burrito which came with no guacamole and when we asked the server she said umm were out of guacamole... Then the fries who can mess up fries? They were cold and soggy. I ordered the bbq chicken salad which they brought out and it was missing the onion rings on top my favorite part. They waiter said i'm going to bring your inion rings soon. So after 15 min of no onion rings i go to the bathroom on my way back I saw the waiter grab some onion rings with his bare hands from a bigger plate of rings and take it to our table... Is that even sanitary? I think not. If this wasn't bad enough my mom ordered the luau salad. The waitress came and said um sorry we dont have the wontons that go in this salad so we said its fine since all the rest of the food was out.. Later the manager came and said that he was making them fry fresh wontons and the salad wouldn't be charged. Overall it was a horrible experience. My hubby got a club sandwich (im sure your wondering how that could've been messed up right?) the bread was burned. I honestly don't know if it was an off day but to mess up all 4 meals seems a little weird to me..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=280,2.36,2.79,2.992,2.2760000000000002,2.6180000000000003
147,Erica W.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,1.0,2016-07-30,"On vacation from Houston, TX and decided to hit up Cheesecake Factory. My son, wanted steak so we ordered the Hibachi Steak. Waitress was great, drinks and appetizers came out in a reasonable amount of time.  My daughter and I both had the Cajun Pasta, good, but a little more oil pooled at the bottom for our taste but I scooped it out.  We're on vacay so the patience meter is extended a little more than the norm. My son, who was the hungriest of us all had to wait on his dinner for about 10 minutes longer. His order was supposed to be everything minus mushrooms and  sub fries for mashed potatoes. What came out was hibachi jerky, VERY dry with sauce on the side laid on top of sprouts and mushrooms, no asparagus and the requested fries never came. Didn't see the waitress for about 7 minutes after the food came so I could let her know we were missing 60% of the order and that it wasn't prepared as requested. She finally brought the fries 15 minutes after the plate was given and my son had started eating on the beef jerky because he was HUNGRY after a full day at the beach.  She said she would  get the manager to come over when I asked for the vegetable that never came (did I mention I never requested a manager). When he finally showed up (to a table that was packing and leaving and I had to wave him over to us) his response was (insert sarcastic laughter) "" whoa looks like he ate it, couldn't have been that dry""! I hadn't even explained yet what happened. I started to tell him that we had been waiting so long he started to eat the ancient meat and the fries had just arrived but he interrupted me and asked my son what his favorite cake was. In true kid fashion he said chocolate so the manager was like ""ok I'll send chocolate cake"" AND WALKED AWAY! No apologies, and didn't even take into consideration that this kid is still hungry! WTF! I never asked for a refund and he didn't even offer to remake it! All I wanted was for my son to actually eat dinner! So, after paying the bill, I went to Subway to feed him because he was still hungry. Oh yeah, the manager never gave me his name otherwise I would use it here. I'll just call him the tall fair skin Jerk, which is fitting because my son was served $18 beef jerky with no sides. Thanks Marina Del Rey Cheesecake Factory for the impeccable service and consideration. Subway did the job and we actually got what we wanted for way cheaper.

We love to go here and always did it at special occasions with my friend that was visiting town. So after not have being here for about a year we decided to have one last night out here before she returned home from her vacation. We were a party of 7 and already when ordering a table the girl looking for a table was being rude in her attitude. It was a Tuesday night around 8.30 and not too crowded.  The service was NOT in any ways okay. We ordered simple drinks, water, wine and beer. Nothing hard or time consuming. The 3 waters came out, we waited. Appetizers came out before ANY drinks at all and we probably waited 20-30 minutes for a lemonade, 2 wine and 1 beer. Oh and yes they forgot the coke zero. The red wine was too warm assuming they had just ignored carrying out the drinks in time. We didn't get any of the dark breads and when we asked the waiter said ""no they hferklgmösgmnls"" and he left. No one could hear or understand what he said and he didn't even care about the fact that we had waited probably 40 minutes for the bread at all. I don't eat the white bread because I don't like it and we were never bought any dark bread even after asking. So, I was STARVING, annoyed by the fact that the service had been so bad and just cranky.  Oh food finally, we thought. we got 3 of the meals and waited politely for everyone to get their meals. You would think they would bring out everything at the same time right? Nope! Same as the drinks something came, something had to be waited for, and of course.... One meal had been screwed up so she got a small bowl of veggies but not her tacos and had to wait for her food even longer while everyone else had gotten their foods.  Yes, desert time. Not everyone could order cheesecake so we need up only ordering 3 of them. Waited another 20 minutes for 3 cheesecakes to be boxed up and the check.  Did i mention that not once did any of the 3 waiters approaching our table ask if we were okay, apologizing for all the mistakes and waits we had experienced and all they said was ""Thank you for understanding and being patient."" NO we did not understand WHAT was taking so long and no we were NOT patient we were all hungry and cranky.

I ordered the Vegan Cobb Salad with a side of sweet potato sides to share, it was filling and delicious! The ingredients tasted very fresh to my surprise and came with hearty vegetables and grains such as beets, asparagus, avocado, quinoa and more. I topped it off with the balsamic dressing but there are plenty more vegan dressings to choose from. Honestly this is something I can easily make at home and not worth $12, but the company was well worth it!

Our whole table was speechless and later I saw one of the male servers scolding her, he was also at the table serving and his face looked very angry when she snapped back at me.

Let me start by saying that it was a big party-seventeen of us to be exact. So I understood that when we got there, we were going to have to wait. I didn't mind at all that we waited 2.5 hours to get seated. At first it was like every other Cheesecake Factory; They sat us down and our waiter was nice and patient. Our food was served at a timely manner as well. Towards the end though when my father wanted a refill a coffee, he was told that there wasn't anymore coffee.  The manager came and specifically let us know that gratuity was not included in the check and asked us to take care of the waiter. I found that a little bit rude, but yet I still took care of him due to our party size.  And then as we were leaving, I wanted a piece of cheesecake to take home. There were two workers there next to the dessert display and I felt no amount of courtesy as I was standing there waiting there for a couple minutes; waiting for them to offer to help me.  I heard them complain about the other guests (very unprofessional) and one of them looked at me and I told them ""I would like to purchase a cheesecake please"" and they said,"" Sorry we're closed"" and returned to their gossiping. Then I noticed the manager walking behind me. I told him I would like to purchase a cheesecake (keep in mind this is the same manager that a couple minutes ago had no problem taking the expensive paid bill of 17 people that I just handed him). His response was ""Sorry that section is closed"".  Very disappointed. Where's the customer service? Being that I own a business of my own, it is a rule that as long as a customer is there, we make sure that he is taken care of. I wanted to complain, but this was the manager! I couldn't believe it.  As far as the food, just go to another Cheesecake Factory location, because the service from this one will leave a bad taste in your mouth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=140,2.88,2.81,2.94,2.216,2.838

My family and I brought my brother here for his birthday dinner...I wish I never recommended this place because the whole thing was a disaster! I understand that many people were at the location especially since it was a Saturday night but to have an experience like we did was VERY uncalled for. We waited an hour and half when we were told that the wait would be only 45 minutes. After waiting for an hour and half we finally get to our seats. Our server greets us a good 15 mins after we have been sitting, no menus, no water, no one walking up to 10 people sitting at a table looking at each other. Then finally she greeted us and gave us menus. She took our drink orders and left. We waited for another 20 mins just to get our drinks and bread which we asked for numerous times....We finally got our waters minus the other drinks and two tiny trays of two piece breads in them for 10 people who have already been waiting at the table for over 45 minutes. We had ordered appetizers with our drinks which she recommended a platter and when we asked if we were ever going to get the platter she said oh they didn't tell you we ran out...(why would anyone else tells us anything when you are the server and barely you even come around!) We then tell her its fine if we can please have some more bread since we wont be getting any appetizers. She says right away and we do not see her for another 15 mins...In the meantime we ask others and they said yes we are making some we ran out and you should have some soon. Ya rightttt we got some I just don't understand how you can run out of food when you are a multi chain restaurant which I have been coming to for years! I wish the only wrong thing was the lack of food and service. But then of course like the whole night we are waiting for our entrees with empty glasses, impatient children, rude service and a ruined birthday celebration. My sister had gone up to the manager letting him know what we were going through. He then comes to our empty table and was asking how we were I then began to tell him that this is uncalled for and a waste of time for all of us! He clearly did not want to hear how unsatisfied we were because when I was talking to him very nicely for someone who has been going through this terrible night at his managing location he then rolls his eyes at me. I told him ""I'm sorry that my annoyance is getting to you that you have to roll your eyes but you have to understand that we have been on this table with 10 people and no service!""  I was fused and no longer wanted my brother's birthday to be further ruined I dismissed him from our table and just advised him all we want is our food which got to us cold and to leave.

81,Shante M.,"Harbor City, CA",0,5,1.0,1.0,2016-12-06,"My husband took me here yesterday for my birthday. I was really excited as I've never been here before and I've always wanted to go. When we got there they asked us how many people were in our party which it was only the two of us. They told us to stand by this plant to wait to be seated. It took a few minutes and a someone came to assist us. They gave us the option of indoor or outdoor. I'm glad we chose outdoor because it was very beautiful outside. That's where the good stops. So as we were being seated my husband informed her that it was my birthday. She told us where to sit, and gave us our menus. Another lady comes by and asked us what we will be having. We weren't ready yet so she gave us a few minutes which felt like maybe 60 seconds. She seemed very impatient. So after her second time around we gave her our drink and appetizer order. She carded me and that's when I got my happy birthday. After that we didn't see her for about ten minutes or more. She didn't bring our drinks or our appetizers. Another man came and brought us our drinks and we still waited for our appetizers. She then reappeared when a group of guys were seated next to us. They told her that it was one of the guys birthday and she told him happy birthday they proceeded to order and she left and still didn't come back to check on us. After some more time went by she came back and asked for the rest of our order which at this time we've spent most of our time just waiting for her to resurface so she can take the rest of our order. We order two entrees and a dessert. She then disappeared again, came back and took more of the groups order. We finally received our appetizers from someone else. At this point I'm becoming a little agitated because after all I've never been here and it's my birthday and I expected a better experience. I was still willing to sit it out but the last straw for me was that a few servers came to that group singing happy birthday and gave them a cake with a candle. A group that came after us. Not only that then all of their food started coming out. So then she tells them that she was going on break and if they needed more help that the back up server can assist them. She comes over to us and she says I'm going on a mandatory break during that time no one will be taking my place I will be back after my break. Goes to the next table and repeats what she said to the first table. I was in such shock so when the replacement server came out with the rest of our food I asked for a manager. He came over immediately and I explained to him that I don't understand how that group got their birthday song and cake before I did. And he said he knows it my birthday it comes after the food which clearly it doesn't because that group got theirs before their food started pouring out. I told him that I didn't want anything more than what we have eaten and drank and that I wanted the check. He tried his hardest to keep us there. He kept insisting that we stay and that he would serve us and they already made our food which at that point I don't care that the food was already made. I don't appreciate waiting on a server with an attitude for an hour on a Monday when they weren't even that busy. The type of service she gave us deserves negative stars. Management needs to retrain her or fire her because what people don't realize is that you are the face of your company so what u put out to your customers will ultimately determine how the visit goes. So even though this place had a great scenery and some awesome sliders the service was horrible and the management was very pushy about us staying even though I told him no well over six times. What I can credit him for is the fact that he gave me a complimentary cheesecake to go. So good job on that, but it doesn't change the fact that my birthday dinner was ruined.

Normally, service there is great and the food and customer service is above average....but when I tell you yesterday was TERRIBLE it was absoulutely UNBEARABLE. My husband and I arrived to the bar ( where we always sit in order to get FASTER service with food and drinks) for cocktails and food. After waiting for about 40 minutes for bread, one entree and crab bites the bartender informed me that the runner forgot to bring our food....EVEN THE BREAD..... in the mean time... table after table and every other bar patron recieved our food. So after a couple cocktails and no food later I told the bartender that we could just leave if we are not going to be served any food. So he was very friendly about it and got the manager. The manager Amanda came out and assured us that the food would be there right away and was not !! It took another 20 minutes... and the order was wrong !!!! ugggh fast forward..... when she brought out the food again I asked her if it was safe for me to order anything else or would it take another hour.....she reassured me it would come out right away. IT DID NOT ......after another 40 minutes or so I saw Amanda casually pass by the bar and I stopped in asked her ....where are the chicken sliders? To her suprise she asked ...they didnt bring them yet? I told her no...then she went in the back and in about 10 minutes later she brought them out. LMAO.... when I tell you they ruined our entire experience...it would be an under statement. So then, in the end they took the 7 dollar chicken sliders and 7 dollar crab bites off and we paid 20 bucks for our pasta and 61 bucks for our drinks. I also tipped both off the bartenders 5 dollars a piece because they made pretty good drinks. Oh then she had the nerve to ask my husband and I if we were going to pay the bill...

The wait was normal (45 minutes or so on a weekend) and 4 of us were seated on the patio. 20 minutes later with no server, I asked a busboy who our server was supposed to be. His personal conversation with another busboy couldn't be interrupted. I went inside to the hostess desk and she said she'll send a waiter out. The waiter arrived and we ordered a bottle of wine. 20 minutes later he drops off the bottle of wine, unopened, and without glasses, and leaves. We flag down another waiter for glasses, a request he doesn't understand because at this point he thinks we brought our own bottle. We have this second waiter just take the unopened bottle of wine away. Original waiter returns and 3 out of 4 of us order before he wanders off after asking my mother how she wants her side salad cooked. He was completely non-verbal beyond this bizarre question. I was actually wondering if he was having a medical emergency. 3 entrees arrive extraordinarily quickly (like 6 minutes after ordering!), dropped off by the manager. He asked how our evening was going, to which I replied ""Kinda the worst!"" I explain to him that 1. we waited forever at our table and had to ask multiple times for a waiter, 2. we didn't receive water or a bread basket like the tables around us (who had different waiters), 3. that a bottle of wine was dropped off without being opened and without glasses (to which he said ""what bottle?"" and looks around), and that 4. one of us was skipped during ordering. The manager goes to the hostess area, comes back and informs us that we've only been there ""50 minutes."" Completely irrelevant, and also a lie. I show him 1 hour 9 minutes on my timer. He never apologizes, but mutters about how maybe all the glasses were dirty and they need to do dishes. At this point he realized that I don't have food, and nobody has drinks, and insists, condescendingly, ""Honey, let me bring you some food. I don't want you to starve.""

I tend to be very understanding to restaurant service as I do have a well understanding with the dynamics of it. However, this location in Marina Del Rey has the absolute WORST service I've experienced. The last visit I had here was on January 22nd, 2017 for a birthday brunch with my four friends. The one pro was that we were sat immediately. Our drinks took about 30 minutes to get to us and I received the wrong drink twice. Maybe there was a tad of miscommunication as we had about 4 different servers helping us out with no introduction to the next. We didn't mind at first, but by the second to third server, with the food still not out, it was frustrating. When the food finally touched our table, again, my order was wrong and when I mentioned it to the server THEN that was helping us out (not the one who took the order) he snapped at me. Like I mentioned, I do not like to make a fuss, but this was ridiculous. I know what's appropriate when it comes to customer service. The last server to help us ( didn't catch her name) was negligent to us but not the rest of her tables. I brought up to the manager about the service and he was dismissive. All he did was take off the drink off the bill THAT I didn't order. No apology either. If I could give this review no stars, I would.

345,Teresa W.,"North Hollywood, CA",1,14,15.0,1.0,2017-03-27,"I generally love The Cheesecake Factory and it is disheartening to have to leave a less than stellar review but bias aside I have to be honest. So here we go...   To give background, I called a month prior to make reservations considering the size of our party. I was told that no advanced reservations could be made for Saturdays and we would have to put our name in upon arrival and wait. Fine, no gripes there.  This past Saturday (March 25, 2017) I hosted a large group dinner (27 people) at this location. The first person in our party arrived at 5pm and put our name in. I arrived at 5:15pm and spoke with my friend to inquire about the wait. She told me she was quoted 1 - 1 1/2 hrs at the most 2 hours. We agreed to wait. And we did so patiently. At 7pm we still had not been called and there were multiple large groups of 12 that came after us but were being seated.  The person who originally put our name went to the hostess to inquire. She was told that because the size of the group was the reason for the hold up. In response, the person who put our name in requested that the group be broken up so we could eat since 2 hours had already passed. Ten minutes later they sat 10 people from our group and a few minutes later they seated 9 people at two different tables leaving a remainder of 8 people. Keep in mind this is AFTER the ""at most 2 hours"" quoted time.  It was about 7:30pm when I witnessed a group of 12 people who arrived after my group (I know because as I stated earlier we had been waiting for 2 hours) being called to be seated. At this point I am now angered. How is it that we are STILL waiting with a remainder of 8 people yet 12 who came after are being seated. I walk to the hostess and first thanked her for ""attempting to be accommodating"" and specifically said, ""You do not need to wait for a table for the remaining 8 you can split us according to whatever is the next available. At this point we would just like to eat."" She called over Manuel and I told him the same thing. He said no problem. I understand.  He indicated there was another table of 12 about to leave and we could have that one.  I said thank you, however we do not need to specifically wait on that table. We would like what is next available whatever number that is. He said ok.  Fifteen minutes later, the hostess calls the next table (not us) a group for 6. I immediately asked how is it that another group that was not here before us is being seated. I just requested to take the next available table. The hostess calls Manuel. I pose the same question to him. He tells me ""I don't understand how it works.""  I refreshed his memory on the conversation he and I just had and instead of accommodating he brings Jonathan over to speak to me. I again explain the scenario. And expressed my distaste in service.  I told him we had been disrespectful to no one, had waited patiently and at this point were being straight up lied to.  After this conversation Jonathan seated our remaining 8. The time is now 8:15 pm (I know because I looked at my watch).  As my party was seated I spoke to Jonathan who I believe was the highest manager available at the time. I again thanked him for attempting to be accommodating and seat us all together and also reiterated why I was upset. He tried to explain his side by saying other patrons were quoted times and they needed to be seated accordingly. I refreshed his memory that we were already an hour over the time quoted to us AND that Manuel (another manager) had just told us we would have the next available table yet tried to give it to a different party.  Overall I could not believe this experience. We had 27 people who were dining in your restaurant about to spend at least $700 or more and you push us to the side. Jonathan didn't even want to give a courtesy appetizer. I mean for goodness sake we waited 3 hours!! People were walking by saying ""you guys are still waiting, wow!""  Marina del Rey location please get it together. This is NOT the way you treat customers. And please spare the ""we are sorry you had this experience please give us another chance"" response that I have seen posted in response to others. DO something to mend the situation.

Everyone got their plates EXCEPT the birthday boy, we ask a waiter and his excuse was ""he ordered steak well done so it's taking a little longer"" even though 2 other people had ordered steak and already received theirs. So that was our red flag they forgot his order. Shortly, a blonde female manager comes over apologizing for their mistake, reassuring they were working on the steak now And ended by offering a free PIECE of cheesecake. I was beyond offended at that moment, everyone at the table was pretty much done, it was his birthday, your forgot his entire plate and all you could do was a piece of cake?  We were ready to say forget his food, give us boxes for the left overs and we are leaving. But I didn't want to ruin his night so instead I got up and went to speak to a different manager. A male standing near the check in podium and I explained everything to him as he apologized profusely. Now I know they messed up big time, everyone's plates were literally being picked up as the birthday boy finally got his plate but I'm still giving 3 stars instead of 1 for the amazing manager who went out of his way to take care of the birthday boys dish even though he wasn't the one helping us to begin with. I very much appreciate when management takes responsibility and makes sure a guest is well taken care of after a mistake like that. It wasn't a petty piece of cheesecake.

278,Emilio M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1350,467,1264.0,4.0,2017-05-04,"I was a 5 star fan of The Cheesecake Factory up until this last visit. The loss of a star may sound silly but it meant something to me. So here we go... First the good stuff. What I still love about this TCF is the location. Close to home and if you're visiting from out of town its a special treat because its close to Mothers Beach (a great place to paddle board BTW) and theres a playground close by for the kids to goof around in. The service is as outstanding as ever. Our server was super friendly and accommodating to our every request even though it was super busy. Well played. The food is always great! If you're gonna take a break from a diet plan it may as well be wrecked here. Most meal are over 1000 calories (even some of the salads)  and that doesn't include the cheesecake. I had the Bacon BBQ burger with fries. A burger served up with more bacon than anyone needs and a pile of onion rings on top! A must try!  There is a 'Low Calorie' menu as well but whats the point? One goes to TCF to enjoy life with friends and family. Then came dessert. Where my heart sank. After scanning the dessert menu up and down several times over, I asked the server where the apple cinnamon cheesecake was? ""Oooooh sorry sir, thats been removed from the menu."" . I must have been the only shmuck ordering it? So yeah...for this reviewer the loss of the only dessert that mattered to me being taken out costs The Cheesecake Factory a star. Oh well. La vida sigue I suppose. Misc:  Expect to wait at least 20-45 minutes. We opted for 1st available and were seated outside within a reasonable amount of time. The patio has plenty of heaters plus a better view of the bay and sail boats. Valet parking or a long walk from the public lot. The lot is metered I think? Overall:  The Cheesecake Factory still remains a great place to get a great meal and lighten up your wallet. But for the price one gets a memorable experience. Yeah I'm bummed that the one cake I was craving is gone but I'll get over it. Still plenty of options. Please tip your server accordingly.

326,Wendy L.,"Culver City, CA",0,47,17.0,2.0,2017-05-15,"My family of 3 went on Mother's Day for an early dinner (5pm).   There was immediate seating on the lower level, which should have been our first clue.   We elected to sit there and were told about the numerous items on the kids' menu that would not be available.    Ok, we were willing to work with that.  We ask that they immediately start a quesadilla for our 6 year old and ask for a few minutes to consider our grown-up order.   We peruse the condensed menu and hubby wants salmon, which is on the condensed menu.  We build appetizers and my dish around his anticipated salmon dish.  Waiter comes back and tells us they are out of salmon.    Why wasn't this told to us with all of the other warnings about what they couldn't serve to us (spaghetti with meatballs, chicken fingers, corn dogs) when we were seated?      We readjust and now we decide to get the Thai lettuce wraps and pot stickers (which are also on the condensed menu).     15 minutes later, after our lettuce wrap order has been entered, we are told that they can't accommodate pot stickers downstairs.   Seriously??????  How did you not know this when we ordered?    We're told the lettuce wraps will be out any minute.   About 10 minutes later, the lettuce wraps come out and the chicken is literally COLD and completely dry.   This is a dish we've had dozens of times and it was never like this.   Just bad.   To make it worse, my son's plan cheese quesadilla STILL hasn't been brought out more than 30 minutes from when we ordered it.  They apologized but what good does that do at that point?   Not so much as an offer of a minor discount or accommodation for one error after another. I expected service to be  slower than usual on Mother's Day.   But I never expected this level of bad.   I would have been better off at McDonald's for my mother's day dinner!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=80,2.96,2.9,2.88,2.6320000000000006,2.924

317,Kyle M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,57,6.0,3.0,2017-05-21,"We have been to the Cheesecake Factory several times for Brunch in the past couple of months. This time we were there to celebrate my Fiancee and I's engagement with our parents who were meeting for the first time.  First of all the food is always great! I particularly enjoy the Eggs Benedict. The yolk is runny (very important) and the English Muffin was well toasted. My Fiancee had the Chilaquiles and she loved them. Crispy tortilla strips and a medium level of spice. We got there right at 10am when they open for Brunch. $6 valet!!! $6 and I watched the guy park the car in the 3rd spot 20 yards from where I was standing. Wow. Our next issue came when we sat outside. We had 7 people in our group and we were walked right out to the patio. They placed a few tables together and moved a few umbrellas and asked us to sit. The seating on one side of the table was sooooo cramped that even my Fiancee (5'2"", 110lbs) had to squeeze in to sit. There were so many umbrellas on the patio that we couldn't move the seats out far enough to sit properly. Now I am not suggesting having less umbrellas, they are totally needed, but the guy who set up the tables didn't even stick around to make sure that his setup was done well. After we fixed the seating ourselves, we looked around for the menus that the waiter was carrying before he set the tables up. We found them stacked on top of the bussing station which was conveniently located on the opposite side of our table. The whole meal we heard crashing and clanging of plates and silverware. Not enjoyable.  Next time I know not to sit in that section of the patio. All in all the experience was OK. Next time I come here I will write another review and I hope for it to be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=60,3.0,2.9,2.884,2.8600000000000003,2.9400000000000004

367,S. M.,"Santa Monica, CA",5,4,,1.0,2017-07-02,"1 of 2... I have NEVER written a review about a restaurant in my life, but I truly felt compelled to do so today. The first time I visited this Cheesecake Factory, was last month, for my daughter's birthday. For the most part, the experience was good, so I decided to bring my husband back today for his birthday. And, I must say that this was probably the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. My family, friends and I have no desire to ever return there again. I'll start from the beginning. I called the restaurant around 1:30pm, and asked if I could make a reservation. I was told that they do not accept reservations on the weekends. ""Okay. How long is the wait?"" I ask. ""There is no wait right now,"" was the reply. With that, my party of 9 left church, en route to the restaurant. When we arrive, no more than 25 minutes later, the wait is now 1 hour. Wait. What?!? As anyone who has ever visited this restaurant knows, making the choice to leave or stay becomes a tough decision, because you have to valet your car. Or cars, in our case. Three of the people in my party have trouble getting around, so we decide to wait it out. And boy did we wait and wait. (SIDE BAR: During our ""wait time,"" I went to the women's restroom to discover that it only has two stalls; both of which were dirty. The stall that became available when it was finally my turn, was the size of an airplane restroom and is situated next to the lone sink. So, if someone is washing their hands, the stall could not be accessed freely. So, I waited again.) Once I made it out, two people in my party had inquired about what could be taking so long to get a table. Our hour had come and gone. We waited another 15 minutes. Someone must have finally felt sorry for us, because we were digging through our purses and bags for trail mix and mints. We were lead to our table through an endless maze of foot traffic. Things were looking up, we thought. We sat down and quickly placed our drink orders with the waitress. I asked for apps for the entire group, so that we could have something to nibble on while we decided on our orders. My party was so excited when the drinks started coming out, we were finally getting the ball rolling. I was deep in conversation, as our drinks (which mostly consisted of lemonades, soft drinks and water), were being placed in front of us. Until suddenly: WOOSH! My head, back and bottom were shocked by what seemed like the coldest feeling imaginable. The drink server had dropped his entire tray on me. My head, back and bottom were soaked. I gasped in horror. Everyone at my table was mortified for me. Servers, waitresses and managers rushed to me with napkins and towels, desperately trying to gauge my response. The server apologized repeatedly. Long story short, I held it together, and the manager offered me free dry cleaning. Okay. We continued on. Get bread. Order food. Fresh/new drinks. Then suddenly my friend tells the group in horror: ""I think I just drank chipped glass."" What?!? She had ordered a strawberry milkshake. She informed our waitress and another manager came over to us. It was determined that yes, her drink had glass in it. Again I say, What?!? What is going on? I'm thinking, we need to get out of here. We need to just leave. Can this get any worse? Again, my party wanted to forge ahead. It's my husband's birthday. We're hungry. We're already two hours in and my friend says she feels fine. Okay, we'll stay. We wait and wait. Finally the apps come out. Yes! We're starving. We quickly devour them. Drink refills. Still no entrees. We wait and wait. And then finally, the food slowly starts to come out. My husband and I get our food first and the group, almost in unison says: ""Please don't wait for us!"" And, thank God we didn't. It would be another 15 minutes before the last person in our party gets their food. Everyone is finally eating, which is uneventful for the most part. My food was good/fine. But, do you remember my friend with the milkshake? She has to send her food back, because her meat was under cooked. Really under cooked. She taps out. She wants nothing else. At this point, she's just waiting for the rest of us to finish. We finish up. Sing Happy Birthday, and it's time to pay the check. My friend's milkshake and food are comp'd. Me, on the other hand, am fully charged for my meal. Really? While I'm still sitting here soaking wet? From my head to me feet? AND, I just discovered that my purse, which was sitting on the floor, is also soaked inside and out? Maybe I'm foolish for thinking my meal was going to automatically be comp'd after what happened to me. At any rate, the waitress talks to the manager, and gets my meal is comp'd.

First of all I have to say that this place's location has a really good view and I have always loved the light decoration they did. However, service was terrible! I went there with my family and family friends to celebrate birthdays of two people in the group. So we were 11 people. And our waiter whose name is Ronald did a terrible job.  - We asked drinks to come with foods but we were about to finish the meal when he brought them. And there were only 3 drinks so it shouldn't have taken that much of time - We asked for ranch sauce or mayo but he never brought it - He brought appetizers too late. We had to asked them twice after he brought main courses  - He didn't take empty glasses on the table. He should have taken them before taking our dessert order. When he brought cheesecakes, the table was a mess! - We were there for birthday celebration for two people and I know that normally waiters sing happy birthday when they bring the cake however, singing didn't happen and this guy didn't even bother to light up the candles! - He put all the coffees on one side of the table he didn't bother to serve them person by person and for this reason, we mixed up which one is decaf which one is a normal coffee - My 3 year-old nephew broke a glass and he didn't clean it up! Glass particles were there and one of us could get hurt especially my nephew! - At the end of the dinner, when one of us gave voice to our complaints, he refused all of the complaints and was very rude.  After awhile, he came back and spoke with the kindest guy in the group and apologized to him. He couldn't even apologize to the person who told him about the complaints!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=140,3.04,3.0,2.868,2.052,3.0160000000000005

With 4of us wait was not bad. CF is usually busy, so I was not going to complain about a long wait. They told us 40 minutes..I think the wait was maybe 30. We sat outside and ordered a drink..didn't even get a sip in before they paged us. I ordered the chicken and waffles again. This was same as in Fresno. Nice crispy waffles, with crispy, tender boneless chicken pieces with poached egg on top. The maple butter was nice on the side. The crispy potatoes maybe twice fried..but they had a nice crisp crunchy texture. Usually side breakfast potatoes can be undercooked, chewy, overcooked, etc..these were nice!

Let me start off with letting everyone know how aggressive staff of valet pariking are. The very first moment we turned into the parking the valet prking guy started screaming ""its $6.5 its SIXANAHALF DOLLA, YOU NEED TO PAY ITS NOT FREE PARKING."" first of all these guys need to chill out, even though $6.50 for a self parking is a lot, im not as much as upset that i am for their rude screaming and asking for money. We definitely wasnt gonna park and run away if we knew it wasnt free. Maybe this location need to train those rude workers and let them know that they arent catching people who are trying to climb and jump over the America-Mexico Great WALL! I wouldnt say the hostess was the best, either, she didnt even say hi and waited 'till i ask her if she works here and could maybe help us,perhaps!!!! The waiter was nice and made good suggestions on the manu. Food was pretty good especially the burger. The heaters in patio were just for one side of the table so one of us shud sacrifice himself for the other. One could enjoy the view and the other experience the ICE AGE.

Our first meal was on Fathers Day, the staff and kitchen performed perfectly. It seems (generally speaking) that really busy restaurants do great when they are really busy. Service is faster, more urgent. The kitchen is hall'in ass so they don't get backed up. And yet when the pace is a bit slower the entire process slows down, the servers are MIA for ages it seems. The back of the house lacking the need for speed seems to casually process orders. I believe the slower pace provides an opportunity to get distracted, have some horse play, and the I'm in no hurry today syndrome takes affect.

17,Loree K.,"Los Angeles, CA",266,129,276.0,1.0,2017-07-17,"Never. Ever. Ever Again. As a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory as a no-brainer go to (virtually anywhere) I feel extremely disappointed in my experience over the past weekend at this particular location. First and foremost, I am very aware of the long wait times at all cheesecakes and this review has nothing to do with the initial wait time. As this location is a beachfront location we decided to sit in the beachfront portion which is partially separated from the main portion. After about 45 minutes of waiting, we were seated. I went to the women's bathroom and it was a one stall bathroom which was filthy. We notified the restaurant. After being seated our waiter came to take the order. I had to repeat myself several times because he didn't want to write anything down on paper. Also, he acted very odd when we asked for simple requests. Our first request was a bread basket. It took us 55 minutes and asking two waiters maybe 7 times to get the bread basket. Second, I ordered a glass of wine. My wine came in a dirty glass. Since our waiter was long gone my mother decided to take my glass back to the bar to get it changed. After swapping the cup, the bartender told her to tell the waiter and that they should bring another glass on the house. We put in our order and after the 55 minutes when we got our bread we got a notification from the waiter that one of the items we ordered is sold out (which was just grilled artichokes btw). Ok great, tell us after an hour. I opened my napkin and silverware to find that my fork had a very disgusting unidentified something on it. I called another waiter and complained since ours was nowhere to be found. He then made a face himself and took the fork and promised me plastic silverware for me and my family (which never came). The food came all wrong, my aunts margarita had pickled jalapeños on it, and everything tasted not as good as it usually tastes. The waiter brought me another glass of wine after my father had to explain to him that it was dirty and explained to him that the bartender said that it should be replaced. Literally no common courtesy to replace it without an explanation. The waiter was the most odd waiter I have ever had. None of the waiters were communicating with each other either. When we asked for anything it took so long to get it that we just wanted to get out of there. They never cleaned the table they barely wanted to bring us anything we asked for. I felt as if the waiter thought it was a chore. At the end, we got our check and the waiter had TRIPLE charged my wine, which was dirty in the first place, after he brought me a second one. Anyway, we complained to the manager about the check and I started to vent about how its just been an extremely terrible experience. He apologized and told me I should have told him earlier. To end this review, I would like to say that due to the lack of cleanliness that I witnessed in those few hours I would never recommend that anyone I know go here until they fix these issues. As far as customer service goes, the staff definitely needs some help with that. Never at any other cheesecake factory (and I have been to a lot) have I experienced anything like this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=160,2.68,2.86,2.86,2.116,2.7880000000000003

I was there a couple days ago, looking forward to having some Cheesecake with my family and as I approach the take out counter, I was greeted by the most rude cashier with the worst attitude (Maryon). The first thing he asked was ""you getting Cheesecake?"" I said yes, and went ahead and let him know what I wanted. I didn't even want to ask any questions to avoid being yelled at. Once he handed me the cheesecakes, I asked him if the receipt was in the bag. After looking around the counter, he found my receipt and threw it in the bag and under his breath he said ""it is now"" and that was it. The total didn't seem right so instead of even bothering to ask this man anything, I decided to call the establishment while I was still in the parking lot. And after speaking to manager (Amanda) it seemed that there had been some miscommunication as far as the rules they had for the deal they had on the cheesecakes for that day (half off). But instead of her apologizing for the error, and the fact that her horrible staff member had the worst attitude and wasn't approachable, she went ahead practically defended him by saying that I should have read the sign. I decided to contact corporate where they were very apologetic for both their employees actions. The price was the last thing I cared about. It was the simple fact that they have the worst people running this place. Horrible customer service. After going through some of the other reviews, I found a few other people who mentioned this same old African American man with the worst attitude.

We came as a group for a birthday!! Once we got seated almost 3 hours later, the waiter spilled ice water on my friends mother she was yelling and they just said sorry. Manager looked and said ok I'll give you guys free calamari. They didn't bother to ask if she was ok if she needed anything didn't even turn on the outside heater. Our waitress was horrible didn't ask if we needed anything we had to repeat ourselves. Then remind her who ordered what. Who ever replaced her during her break was amazing we wanted him to stay. But sadly he was only covering for her but in that short break he was able to lift up our spirits with his positive vibes. We had to end the night early but they were giving us a hard time cause we needed to spilt the bill and they didn't want to do it more than 3 ways. I'm glad I was able to leave closer to 10:40, sadly the rest of the group stayed till nearly midnight.  I will never go back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=120,2.44,2.83,2.816,2.148,2.6740000000000004

659,Brendan T.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,20,,2.0,2017-08-20,"For a place called the cheesecake factory a person would expect some kind of moderately factory esc precision in the timely delivery of cheesecake goodness to mouths. we ordered cheesecake to go, paid and got our drinks. We then proceeded to wait by the to go counter for at least 20 minutes for 2 slices of cheesecake to be placed in plastic containers. This gave me time to observe the operation and why it is going wrong and become rather unimpressed. There was a single person slicing and plating all of the orders in a busy restaurant that specialises in cheesecake.  This poor fellow had to do each order and traverse behind a long counter for no apparent reason walking around the other staff in this narrow space to set the orders  in place for the servers. We even saw him have to leave and go to a store room for supplies. Has someone running this place with an analytical mind has ever stood in this operation and watched what was going on? Maybe it would not be an insane idea to make this big enough for the staff to work and have more people there so the customers could get their food? Its just hard to watch. We were here sitting down once before for cheesecake and the wait was bad then too. The good: nice patio and pretty building. Cheesecake is good if over sweetened. The bad: Inadequate washroom facilities. Valet only parking.

I suppose we should have figured that out when there was no wait to be seated at 6 PM on a Saturday.  Our first server took a long time to take care of our table. We probably waited 40 minutes for food.  They were out of the brown bread we liked, and of course once we were finished, it seemed all they had was fresh brown bread.   Our nachos, which is something we usually love, were burnt and had minimal toppings and cheese.  What is really pathetic is that we asked for more cheese.  We didn't even finish them.  Not everything was bad.  When the first server went on break, the second one was very efficient.  Our other two appetizers were decent, and the bread was good, albeit not brown.

I don't want another gift card, I really just don't have the energy to deal with mediocre food AND mediocre service.  We waited 30 minutes for a table, our server takes awhile to bring us water and bread and we ordered right away because we knew it would just be crazy. I order a salad, he orders an appetizer and burger. The appetizer comes out in a good speed but an hour plus goes by and we're like where is our food.... We then get notified that the order got messed up. On top of this, we asked multiple times for new silverwear since ours were DIRTY!!!! He did not bring it, I asked another server who brought it asap. The table next to us also had dirty silverware. That is DISGUSTING, I ate with plastic utensils, I have never in my life done this at a restaurant. My friend asked for ketchup with his burger, never got it. Literally everything that could go wrong went wrong minus finding glass or hair in our food. What a nightmare.

My ENTIRE problem with this place is the staff... Recently went here again after sharing another bad experience I had (see previous post). I swear to God I cannot remember the black waiter's name (something exotic and fruity sounding) but when I do I will update this post; HORRIBLE.  First off for a Sunday wait was not bad. We were seated in like 10 mins...That was the shortest wait we had all evening. It took about 15 mins before we had ANY contact with any staff. A nice white gentleman (Jeff, I believe but not sure) came by, apologized and finally took our drink order. We also noticed 3 OTHER COUPLES who looked as irritated as we did being that were all seated after us and were still waiting. Didnt help either that ""Jeff"" mentioned that our server was working a double as if I cared or that was a logical excuse as to where our actual waiter was. First rule of business you are taught is to never say you are short-staffed, you dont know or you cant help. But here is where things just took a wrong turn: After 30 mins our original waiter STILL didnt show up! So ""Jeff"" finally took our order. Most restaurants, within 30 mins you could already sat, ordered and be halfway through a meal. When our waiter FINALLY came over, he spent at least 7 mins talking to all the other tables. Im sorry but this might get racial but im honest about my reviews so I tell it like it is.. All the other couples were white lol true BUT I noticed the engagement was completely different once he came to our table. His exact words were, ""Y'all need anything else"". Now by this point im pissed and puzzled.....You finally come over after being gone over 30+ mins and not only do you NOt introduce yourself but you address us as if we did something to you?! Took everything inside of me not to grab this idiot and toss him into that nice lake from the view we had...He ended up only coming by once more. He even had his co-worker bring us the check...

The next time he came to our table (which was over an hour of us being there) he was clearing the table and spilled 2 full cups of water on the table which spilled all over 1 of my friends and her phone, it spilled on half of my other friend, and spilled a third on myself. We were very shocked as this has never happened and wanted to complain. But our other friend said we have not received our food and to not cause a scene as he might tamper with our food. We assisted with him with getting the water off the table and asked him to please remover the wet bread, silverware, and wet napkins off the table. He did not! We asked for more napkins as we used ours to help him with the water. He came back with the small paper bar napkins ( yet another slap in Our faces). Our good then came to the table. Two out of the 3 plates were cold. We asked him and napkins, and the food being cold and he said, ""you are asking for too many thing at once and I'm getting nervous. When I get nervous I start spilling things like water on people"" and he then laughed. That was it and we asked for the check. We asked if he could split the check and he then said, "" that would take too long, he had other tables to attend too"". I then asked for the manager. I had never experienced such terrible customer service before. I explained all of what happened to the manager. He then stated he would have to get the senior manager of 16 years as this was above his level that he could handle. Steven the senior manager came over and listen to what happened. He stated he would comp the two means that were could as we didn't eat them and give us a free cheesecake. He then asked to pack up our meals and disappeared. When he returned with our food he wished us a good night and told us he would send the first manager over to handle our checks. Once our checks came nothing was comped. We only received free cheesecake. This is truly unacceptable! This experience has made me not ever want to come to this establishment again! I have lost trust in the company's ability to give proper customer service and in the management as well!

279,James W.,"Venice, CA",64,396,19.0,4.0,2017-10-18,"Something for everybody should be their theme. The Cheesecake Factory Marina Del Rey has always been one of their best locations. Located in the Marina, there is a large valet only parking lot and the dining room and area is very large. You wouldn't really think about this because often times this location is just packed wall to wall. The menu is long and eclectic. The variety of dishes are substantial. Old school favorites such as the Cajun Jambalaya to the Chicken Madeira still exist. Even my favorite default of the Herb Roasted Chicken is still tasty good. Cheese cake/dessert selections are just what they are known for, and a good bar rounds off their fanfare. What keeps me coming back is their consistency and overall great service. My only complaint is that some of their taste isn't as bold anymore, and portion sizes are shrunken inversely to inflation. Great thing though, you can order food at the bar if you can't wait for a dining table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey,2.64,2.86,2.748,2.768,2.7720000000000002

One server put in my order (and got it all wrong) but wasn't my server in the end. I didn't know they had even switched. The new server rushes past and slams 2 lemonades on the table, no napkins, water or bread at 6:25pm. However we had ordered an ice tea and a margarita. The manager came and we told him, he apologized and made the comment that he had 2 capable servers and had no idea why they weren't on it. We ordered sliders no onions, pasta with extra sauce and stuffed mushrooms. My pasta came out before the bread with NO SAUCE (all the sauce on the side) by itself. No sliders and my appetizers no where in sight. The manager again apologized and took my plate back. The mushrooms arrived cold-warm and the sliders had tons of onions. At this point I was over it. My pasta was brought out correct and by this time it had been an hour of dealing with issues. When the appetizers arrived we had to ask for bread and utensils. When I asked for the check they charged me full price for everything. Happy hour items full price even though the first server said he would get us the HH price since we had to wait so long to order.

Both spicy cashew chicken plates were extremely salty it was inedible. The medium well cheeseburger that I got came rare!

We went to the outside area and I told the girl we needed a table for 4 adults and 3 kids. She then proceeded to rudely cut me off and left TO LOOK FOR A TABLE.. yes - the hostess left us there while she was walking around the place checking for a table. Then, some short Asian dude (looked like a manager) came and said there were no more tables and the place was packed. I explained we were just told to come out there to be seated right away and he was like no. Then, the hostess came back and told him there were no tables but tried coming up with a solution but the dude said no and said we could sit in the lounge area or leave. I asked how long it would be and the answer was ""long"". We decided to do the lounge as we were all there already. We sat at a table and asked the waiter to turn in the little heater but guess what: not working. We are something quickly and left.

282,Mike P.,"Santa Barbara, CA",1,12,5.0,2.0,2017-11-04,Let me start off by saying the Cheesecake Factory is awesome but not this location. I would suggest you googling The Cheesecake Factory in Redondo Beach is worth taking a 25-minute ride down there because once you get there you will need Lee be seated because that place is three times bigger than the Marina Del Rey location and you have a better Ambiance still overlooking the harbor. The reason why is because first of all parking there is tight in the valet service is horrible. The reason why it's horrible is because the valet service should know how full the restaurant is since it's a small restaurant because the management or the stuff that the restaurant should be communicating back to the valet attendants letting them know how full the restaurant is because this is one of the smallest Cheesecake Factories they have. The management there is very nonchalant along with most of the workers just because they work at the Cheesecake Factory they have lost touch of reality in the field of customer service. So why wait in a long line that's going to take you about 30 or 35 minutes till we see it and a compact area when you can spend the 25 and 30 minutes go down go down the coast and be out of more comfortable vibrant Cheesecake Factory and spend your money in the place where you feel way more comfortable and at ease and definitely the waiters or servers there are way more professional and friendly hl,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=20,2.6,2.7,2.72,2.6000000000000005,2.66

Depending on the day of the week, it's usually a 20-30 minute wait before you get seated, then after it's about another 5-10 minutes until they take your order and another 20-30minute wait until you get fully served. They only take valet parking. I think that it's $6...? Don't remember. Food is great! No complaints about that. This review is based on my experience at this restaurant for Sunday brunch.

The food is usually good, not distinguishly better or worse than any of their other locations. However, the reason for three stars is because of my home deliveries from this location.  One time I ordered avocado rolls and they arrived looking kind of bad. The avocado looked like it had been sitting out for hours, was a brownish color and it didn't taste good. I've ordered the avocado rolls many times at location and they've been a pretty green color so I know they aren't supposed to look like that.

I'm not sure the time frame we were quoted as I was apart of the second car for our party that arrived later. We waited for over an hour to be seated while basically everyone that walked passed us, where all seated right away. It was very busy, so we waited.  While waiting, my niece was sitting on the furthest bench to the parking lot outside, also in the spot of the bench closest to the parking lot, and in a white Lexus, valet almost hit her while backing it up directly in front of the restaurant! She didn't move, but it wasn't until her Dad tapped on the window did the car stop moving. Not exaggerating, the car was 4-5 inches from her. Possibly closer.  While waiting, my husband ordered a glass of wine & a beer at the bar, which took very long to receive.  Finally we're seated. Summer was our server. After 5 or so minutes, she approaches us to tell us that she'll be with us in a moment. She comes back where we're all ready to order, waters for everyone except 3 kids drinks, and we ordered our food at that time as well. Bread hits the table- breads get devoured since there were lots of hungry people at the table- my daughter was crying that she was thirsty, I waited and waited and waited for our drinks, finally I got up and walked to the server station to get a water for my child.. a few moments later, water finally arrives. The food took a very, verrryy long time. The waters were never refilled even though we requested it, one child didn't receive her juice until we were all finished eating, and we were never checked on during the course of our meal either. No additional alcohol or dessert was ordered because we were sure we wouldn't get it anywhere near on time. By the time we saw Summer again, we needed boxes and our check and one person needed to place a to go order. ""What do you want?"", Summer asked him. Straight to the point and not in the friendly way.  Overall our server seemed overwhelmed & frustrated, which is totally fine, as long as you're able to keep it positive, explain that things are taking a few extra moments, and keep in touch with your guests. Instead we were totally ignored and spent a lot of money, really, for less than mediocre service.  1 star goes to the ONE gentleman wearing a purple button down, most likely a FOH Manager, who was genuinely friendly when he brought out our food and smiled and greeted us when we walked past him to our table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=40,2.68,2.71,2.768,2.308,2.6980000000000004

A large group sat next to us.  Still, we sat.  The other guy got his food.  The people next to us were served their food.  Still, we sat. Finally had to disturb a waitress taking yet another order across from us, and asked if she was our waitress.. And that we have been sitting here and don't even have water. She apologized, found a piece of paper to jot down our order and took off. Finally some guy came by to greet us.  Really?... Like 20 minutes later.?! We gave him our order but told him we gave it also to the girl at the order station (pointing in her direction), but before we could ask for bread and water, he went over to her.  So we don't know if she's coming back, or he's coming back, or... Hell who knows!   My friend finally got up and walked over to yet  another waiter and asked for a basket of pumpernickel bread. He said they were out, and my friend said, um no you're not..go find some. She came back to our table and a few minutes later miraculously, they found our bread... as well as some water . FINALLY! Soon after our mushrooms and avocado rolls came out. Really were never checked on again. Not that we were going to order any more after all the chaos we went  through just to get this! Our waiter came by once more to drop the bill and luckily we had cash so we didn't have to wait any longer to get out of this place! You all really dropped the ball! You should be ashamed! Only reason I'm giving a 2 star is because our food was actually good. Too bad the service was crap!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey,3.04,2.7,2.804,,2.8360000000000003

299,Danielle M.,"Los Angeles, CA",411,9,2.0,1.0,2018-01-03,"I work in the service industry A. So I know a little bit about seating and proper ways to run the restaurant not only to keep customers happy but to ensure the restaurant makes the most money they can on a given night. I go to the Cheesecake Factory ALL the time but leave it to my 21st birthday dinner to have it plummet. When I called they said I couldn't make a reservation after 5 o clock so they said to show up 30 minutes prior and should only be up to a 30 minute wait. When I got there, there was a HUGE wait but the entire restaurant was completely empty! I was told a 2 hour wait! When I spoke to the manager I got some bullshit excuse that they have a policy that's states 80% of the restaurant they keep unoccupied until a specific time? BUT YOU DONT TAKE RESERVATIONS AND HAVE HUGE PARTIES WAITING FOR NO REASON AND YOURE LOSING MONEY? Makes a lot of sense. A party of 9 probably would've spent $500 and they lost out to what keep a table reserved for a party of 2?

When we got to our table, it was still not ready, had food scraps and was wet - yikes! While we were standing to have it cleaned, the waitress, Summer, dropped a couple of metal bread containers and they almost hit my feet.  Summer just walked away - no apologies - didn't even ask if I was alright. She was so rude and did not care! Talked to the manager about the incident and he was not receptive at all!  Just like Summer, I felt that he didn't care at all. On the way out, I told the manager that I was going to share my review on Yelp.  He just looked at me and walked away.  I appreciate that someone responds to the negative review but they do such a poor job not taking care of the issue when it's presented to them at the restaurant.  Very poor customer service - will never go back to this location again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=20,3.0,2.64,2.804,,2.7840000000000003
262,Tom D.,"Detroit, MI",1,5,,2.0,2018-01-07,"I eat at this Cheesecake Factory like 3-5 times/ month. When I get carryout, my order is consistently wrong. Literally every time I order carryout, I have missing sides, food is prepared badly/ burnt, or something is prepared directly opposite of what I requested (e.g. extra onions, when I requested none).  It's kinda a running joke I have with myself now. I order something and don't even check before I leave...partially because I think ""there's no way they're gonna get it wrong AGAIN THIS time"" and partially because I like to live on the wild side. The shit is always wrong.  The food is always good though, and I never have a problem with my food when I dine in...so there's that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey,2.88,2.65,2.8,,2.742

Jesse was our server... made me feel rushed and uncomfortable. I felt like a nuisance. Ordered a veggie burger, no cheese, and side salad. My friend ordered meatloaf and ceasar salad. No bread was ever served. Jesse brought out her meal. I waited. He came to the table and asked if I had an allergy. He said they put cheese on the last veggie burger. He called a manager. After a ridiculously long wait she appears with a veggie burger and fries. No salad? Why not bring the salad while I'm waiting and where did the burger come from?  Amanda, the manager, said they just made another one. Had to ask for my salad. Comped a slice of cheesecake.

276,Brittany S.,"Hawthorne, CA",13,115,51.0,1.0,2018-01-08,"I'm ready to cry at how poor the service is tonight. Me and my boyfriend came here on a Wednesday night. Pretty slow and not busy at all. ""Great"" we think. We are seated immediately but they place us at a table with a very bright light when the entire restaurant has intimate settings... like literally the light is shining on me like I'm about to put on a performance. Then after 6 minutes, our server finally comes to us and asks us what we would like to order. SHE DOESNT ASK US IF WE WANT ANYTHING TO DRINK SO MY BOYFRIEND ASKS HER IF WE CAN HAVE SOME WATER. I then notice we don't have bread so I ask her if we can have some bread as well. She says yes. She doesn't come back to us after she gets us our water but our bread still isn't there. It's been about 12 minutes and at this point I get up and go to the front and ask them what's the hold up on bread because that's what cheesecake is known for. The man at the front tells me there's a delay on bread and all the tables don't have them but should be out shortly but I can tell a manager if I want.. I chose not to. I got back to my seat and I'm visible upset so I ask if we can move to a table where it's not so bright. GUESS WHAT!! Our server comes up to my boyfriend and I asks ""so I need to know. Who said something about the bread not being here? How long did it take exactly because this is my name on the line"" I tell her it took 10-11 minutes and she lets me know the kitchen is backed up. That's fine hunty, but that's not how you approach anybody. The entire night was stale and I don't think my server was professional or prompt until she realized she may or may not get a tip. She was a middle aged black woman, natural hair, and slightly shorts didn't get her name but that's okay because I told my boyfriend let's never visit this location again. Service was lacking and in top of that, my food was nasty. The nachos were delicious and my boyfriend liked his food but maybe it was just my luck but my eggplant Parmesan was a no.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey,2.72,2.63,2.784,,2.6660000000000004

275,Vickie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,101,22.0,3.0,2018-01-12,In general I like Cheesecake Factory . I love the one at the marina because of the view and the fact that you can sit outside .. but the service is the worst here . Thru either forget about your drinks or bring the food late or forget to bring bread . But this last time we went on Jan 1st it was the worst I sent my food  back twice. I ordered shrimp scampi the pasta was to al dente to the point of it being chalky the shrimp was rubbery and had no flavor. It just amazes me that the food is not seasoned correctly .  I guess it depends on the Chef's but when your paying $22 for a bit of pasta and 5 shrimp you want it to taste good . Not going back anytime soon . I would rather give my business to a mom and pop restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey,2.76,2.65,2.808,,2.694

There is a valet of $6.50 or it varies, depending on what day you come. Just like other restaurant valets, you pay when you leave.  Expect a long wait, (because they dont take reservations), if you choose to dine outside with the view. We always get outdoor seating when we go here (we dont mind the wait), because the view of the marina is something to definitely see and it adds up to the ambience while enjoying your time eating with friends and family.  Their food is always good, especially their cheesecakes (reason why it's cheesecake factory) and their service is something worth mentioning to people.
