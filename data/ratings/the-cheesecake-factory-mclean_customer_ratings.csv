The host staff was rude to my wife, but nice to me (maybe because they were females?). anyways, I had asked if it was okay to walk around and how far the pagers/beepers would go.. the hostess told me I could walk around anywhere in the mall (1 hour long wait), but the pager/beeper only works just outside of the restaurant. She said once I'm done walking around to just check back with them to see if the pager is still activated. We all walked around, we went back and my wife went to ask them. They basically were just saying ""your table isn't ready yet!"".. when my wife obviously knows that, but she wanted to make sure the pager works since we walked outside the area and the hostress said it might get deactivated. my wife's other cousin knew one of the managers and spoke to him. luckily he got us seating (no thanks to the crappy hostesses). we all sat down to eat.. 10 of us squished at a table that holds maybe 6 people comfortably.  The food was in large quantities as Cheesecake is known for. However the quality of the food was just mediocre. Well the food was OK, but the atmosphere brought it down. Cheesecake is loud and obnoxious.. and it might help to turn up the lights a little bit. Very dim inside the restaurant. Our waiter was slow with our food/check and didn't know anything about the drinks. Of course since we had 10 people.. gratuity was automatically added to the check.. even though we didn't think he earned the full amount.

Maybe it's because of all the cheesecakes options. The oven-fresh wheat bread is a good pre-appetizer. The menu is large and contains mostly meat-based dishes. I ordered the Evelyn's Favorite pasta. The quantity was huge and mostly pasta. I did not make a dent to my plate though I had my fill. The taste is heavier than what I usually have it and I would personally like to have more vegetable in the pasta instead of having them sprinkle here and there on my pasta.

The fish tacos were AWFUL. The fish was disguising. The fish I bit into was grey and hard. -The waiter charged me for the dinner salad when I ordered the lunch salad (he corrected the charge after I pointed it out to him) -He didn't give us any sort of discount for messing up the order and extending our lunch by an extra half hour.

392,Rebecca M.,"Vienna, VA",387,338,279.0,4.0,2012-09-28,"I'm updating my review to add an extra star for fantastic customer service.  The last two times I've visited the Cheesecake Factory, I have been greeted, seated, and served promptly, politely, and with a cheerful energy that says ""I know my menu and really want to be here serving you right now"".  I have found this a rarity in quick-turn mall-located restaurants, especially in this area.      This is a chain restaurant, plain and simple. Although the decor is quite generic, the roof high to carry the din of 50 other conversations and kitchen noises, and you always must brave crowds and pay ""mall prices"" for the cuisine, Cheesecake Factory-- especially THIS one-- has become one of my favorite chain restaurants not only for a quick nosh for myself after a hair appointment or between a Stuart Weitzman and Karen MIllen marathon, but also to take groups of people.      I don't know if I have just been lucky, but the past few times I've visited this location I have recieved above par customer service-- suggestions to complement the wine or food, news about the rookie barrista's talent making great lattes, the server's anticipation of needs before they become salient to the customer... all kinds of unexpected but appreciated little touches. I felt compelled to compliment the server's energy and competence to the manager on my last visit, as she exceeded my expectations and made a ""catching up with friends"" lunch seamless and even more enjoyable. I have been in and out in 40 minutes, or stayed and chattted with friends for 2 or more hours with no pressure to leave.    I usually stick to my favorite, fresh 'Go To' items on the menu, which are the ahi carpaccio and the thai chicken lettuce wraps. Many items are seasonal, but these two have fresh natural ingredients which cannot be frozen or made too far in advance. A widely-ranged menu is great for a diverse group of people, but you can't do everything perfectly executed in 20 minutes without sacrificing freshness.  For this reason, I recommend salads, pastas with fresh veggies, or other of the same ilk... read the ingredients to see what appeals to you and contains items that can't be frozen or preserved for days if this matters to you. My favorite cheesecake is the red velvet cake layered with cheesecake and topped with a creamy frosting and shaved bits of white chocolate-- although it is so rich I can only take a couple bites, and even then I have to have coffee to accompany the sweet rich concoction-- or a great cappuccino or latte made by that great new barista. :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=160,2.68,2.99,2.99,3.152,2.8660000000000005

Who knew that Cheesecake Factory has a brunch menu?  I certainly didn't.  I also haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in over five years.  Today's experience may change this. I also noticed that Cheesecake Factory now has a 'skinnylicious menu.'  Though I didn't order from it, it's good to know that they are thinking of our waistlines.   To start things off, the server was great and very attentive.  Refills on drinks were automatic and right on time.  The wait for the food was minimal.  It could also be that it was 11:30 AM and the place was barely filled (probably because no one knows that they serve brunch). We ordered the lemon-ricotta pancakes, which were absolutely DEEE-LICIOUS!  Reminded me of the delicious lemon-ricotta pancakes I had at BLD in Los Angeles (which was featured on Food Network's 'Best Thing I Ever Ate').  I would definitely come back for brunch to eat these again. Also ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad...I know, I know fish and pancakes don't go that well together.  But, the salad dressing was on point.  The avocado it came out with was miserable-looking but I let it go because hey, it's winter on the East Coast...I'm sure it's hard to get good looking avocados at this time.  The salad overall tasted good but was very overprice at almost $17.

147,Glenn C.,"Reston, VA",54,118,3.0,2.0,2013-04-04,"The Cheesecake Factory is a perfect example of a jack of all trades and a master of none. I've never left here saying ""man, I can't wait to come back."" The menu is the size of a book, offering literally every type of cuisine I can think for. There's pasta, pizza, proteins of all kinds, soups, salads, tacos, curry, asian-inspired dishes, nachos, wings, noodles, and even more that I cannot honestly remember. Then of course there are the cheesecakes, which come in what must be 500 different flavors. When a restaurant tries to include anything you could possibly be in the mood for, they insure that it won't be expertly prepared. How can any kitchen possibly master so many dishes from so many different branches of the culinary art? The answer is they can't, and that inability shows itself when it arrives at your table. Of course, their big claim to fame are their cheesecakes. I'm not saying that they're terrible, but for a restaurant to name itself after one signature dish, it had better be perfect, or as close to it as possible. Alas, yet again the Factory lets itself down. True cheesecake, the kind you'll find in a real New York delicatessen, doesn't come in dozens of different flavors, and it's also nowhere near the consistency you'll find here. Cheesecake should be firm yet creamy, and the crust shouldn't factor in nearly as much as Cheesecake Factory makes it. The last time I visited, I had a flank steak that was overcooked and nowhere near as tender as it should have been- and we're talking about flank steak here, not filet. I don't blame the chefs getting it wrong. Combining the size of the menu with how cavernously large the dining room is, they must be under constant attack from 5:30 until close. It always makes me scratch my head how people will wait an hour or more for a table here when there are dozens of far superior restaurants within a mile radius. Save yourself a wait and a uninteresting dinner, and choose any one of those better eateries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=260,3.04,3.1,3.1,2.8240000000000003,3.0760000000000005

Well anyways the reason it doesn't have 5 stars is because the location is poorly advertised and I had to search for it. But anyways onto the actual restaurant. When we showed up we were able to be seated right away which I was surprised with because every one I have ever been to has been at least a 45 min wait. But anyways our server was pretty nice and very attentive and did not give us any problems with the fact that i drink so much soda that she had to refill all the time. The food was very fresh and came out quickly with no issues. We ordered the avocado rolls which were AMAZING and then I ordered a Shepard  pie which was sooooo good.

We arrived at Cheesecake around 8:45 and surprisingly there was no wait (after all it was a Saturday night). We had to make a 10:50 movie so this was perfect!  Our server was Tareq who greeted us fairly quickly after we were seated. We started by ordering waters and received them shortly after. Good start right? Let me emphasize START because everything went downhill from here. My one guest ordered a Dirty Ketle martini with blue cheese olives, I ordered a passion fruit mojito and my other guest ordered an old fashion. Our drinks took some time to get delivered and when we received them we were not impressed. My mojito looked and tasted good but really didn't have any liquor in it. Don't get me wrong, I am by no means an alcoholic but if i wanted juice it sure as hell wouldn't have costed $10... My one guest might as well just have ordered olive juice.....Sounds gross right? Right, his martini was awful and as crazy as it sounds really didn't taste like it had liquor in it either...weird considering 98% of a martini is supposed to be liquor. Oh yes and I forgot to mention the fact that he didn't get his blue cheese olives.  Whatever, anyways he got his olives and drank his liquor infused olive juice so we weren't ""those people."" Who are those people you ask; those people are the ones who constantly complain when they go out to eat for no reason other than to get shit for free.

My one guest ordered the coulette steak MEDIUM RARE, my other guest ordered shrimp jumbalaya with extra sauce on the side and I ordered the chicken tortilla salad. Food came out and the steak was on the verge of well done (Ew), my salad had maybe 5 small slithers of chicken in it and the extra sauce for the shrimp dish was nonexistent. Funny considering our server was also non existent for a good 20 minutes. Long enough for my guest to get out of his seat and have to ask a bus boy for the extra sauce. It came out and then 5 minutes later so did Tareq. He asked how everything was at that moment......really? It's a little too late don't you think? Yeah so that was that. At the end of the meal I informed Tareq how overcooked the steak was and made it known that we were looking for him but he was not around. He expressed concern for .5 seconds and then walked away to get the dessert menu. At this point I was so fed up with everything that I declined cheesecake; this was one of the only reasons I wanted to go to cheesecake in the first place. Sooo to say I was pissed is an understatement....we paid our bill and tipped just under 18% because being a server myself I understand the whole $3.00 a hour issue. Let it be known though that he deserved way less than this. I then asked to speak to a manager when as my server I think Tareq should have taken the initiative to get them involved from the beginning. I told the manager, Jeremy what happened and explained the inattentiveness of Tareq and lack of urgency in his staff. Jeremy was nice and said everything a manager should say including ""when you come back I will take care of you."" This was a nice gesture but I live over an hour away from this location and the last thing I want is to have another awful experience. However, I feel as though he could have handled a guest complaint a little differently, it was as if it were of no real concern at that moment. Moral of the story is for the first time in a long time I was dissatisfied with over 90% of my dining experience at a chain restaurant. I hope this issue is addressed ASAP.

Between the slow service, absent minded server, incomplete order, and the indifferent attitude towards our complaints, led us to forgo our dessert and leave with our experience unsatisfied....much like leaving a strip club unsatisfied.  Come to think of it, you always leave a strip club unsatisfied. Anyways I digress.   This is not rocket science.  The ability to multi-task is a prerequisite for employment at any restaurant.  Not only was multi-tasking not a part of this servers repertoire, empathy for his mistakes were nowhere to be found.  Some food was overcooked, others were missing requested modifications, drinks were made with incorrect garnishes, and the 20 minutes it took for our server to check on us after we had completed our meal is unacceptable. On top of all of this, the complaint to management was additionally lack luster.  Yes, we received an apology, but the effort stopped there to ease our dissatisfaction.   Im going to chalk this up to being an isolated incident.  It's not like I'm never going to go back to cheesecake.  But just done expect much from this particular establishment in terms of stellar customer service.  You might actually get better customer experience from the one legged stripper with crack yellow teeth and overgrown pubic hair.......cause you know that she needs your money!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=220,3.04,3.05,3.05,3.0160000000000005,3.046

I wasn't even going to write this thing because I don't want to trash restaurants on here, particularly chains which is very much a ""you know what you're getting into when you come here"" thing.  But a bunch of basic steps in the world of service were completely ignored here.  A birthday group of 9 shows up at 5 and leaves after 8:30 and not because their casually hanging out just enjoying the decor and the coffee?  That's INSANE. Took three trips from this guy to get full drink orders.  He missed out on his chance to sell dessert because he randomly rang in only two people's orders and then just dissapeared.  He took leftoever food away from the table to box it himself in some hidden corner of the restaurant, carrying dirty plates from fellow table members over top of this food to be brought home and even proceeded to go to another table with it to answer a random person's question, with my food just leaning in on their table where there food is?  Come on. The worst offense was the check though.  Not establishing at the beginning that there were going to be seperate checks, this guy brings us the check, tells us to number 1, 2, 3, 4 on each order so they know how to seperate it and then write who's card is who's for each number!  Comes back what mustve been a seriously legitimate ten minutes later (felt like 20) and presented us with the seperated checks to make sure they were done right....then went away again to physically ring up the check?  Come on now man....this guy was gone for ANOTHER 10 minutes.  Nice kid, but flighty as all get out without a lick of ability to multitask - Granted he was busy, but his mistakes started early on.  When my sister in law told him she couldn't decide between a shot of patron or a margarita, he sat there and waited for her response.  She then said - You know what, put the patron IN the margarita, everyone laughed and with her drink only (three mojito's and sodas and stuff were ordered at this point as well) comes by with a shot of patron.....and then tells her that the margarita is coming shortly........???????  Oh, not a maragarita pure per say, but one without tequila for her to add her own as .... she desired?????  Or something that made no damn sense lol.  Birthday girl, we ask the guy if there are cheesecakes that are key lime....he says yes - Someone then goes - wait wait wait, anything with coconut?  The waiter says, there's a Khalua Coconut (we flip cause Khalua is the birthday girls favorite liqueur and she's a freak for coconut so double whammy) - waiter says great - comes back with a slice of key lime cheese cake with a candle in it......What the hell kind of mess????? My wife and I order a chicken caesar salad to split....never split, no extra plate until everybody else's food came out which was all seperate and crazy, apparently spinach was being waited on for someone's crab cake dish and this caused mayhem.  Finally get the plate, split the caesar salad - expected that generic garlicy, cheesey, creamy chicken flavor you get from all caesar salads....which for the most part we did get...until I get slapped by a sweetness, definitely like a terriyaki sauce.....investigate the plate further and underneath the salad, is a healthy dollop of terriyaki sauce.  Not only interesting because that's not something you find in a traditional caesar salad, but odd too because no one at the table had anything terriyaki so it wasn't spill from another plate.  Which means I was served a caesar salad that definitely was either dirty and not washed previously, or was plated with terriyaki and then just disregarded to swap that platte out and put a caesar salad on top of it anyway???????  When presented to the server, he apologizes about it, brings out a new one after everyone else finishes their meal.  no manager follow up, had to not only pay for both this salad and the dessert we ordered, but we also had to pay for the birthday girl cheesecake, you know, the one we didn't request! Place is a huge mess man, it's not just the server, it's the management of how service is conducted and it goes as far as back to the kitchen, cause that plate error, no expiditor on a line would've been able to see, that was the mistake of the whoever was responsible at the salad station, the manager should've been made aware of the problems to offer further assistance at the table and the server should've pre labled every seat so he could've swiftly saved us from that last hour playing this seperation game / follow up check order.  Just awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=260,3.2,3.14,3.14,3.0800000000000005,3.1640000000000006

I do remember ALEM greeting us as he made his way from the kitchen with another tables left overs.He said that he was our server&would be with us soon,which I can clearly recall.We had some time to look at our lengthy menu.We had time to take in the ambiance of the   looked classy almost high end which did not coincide with the very affordable pricing of our food.The design of the restaurant entrance seemed like that hotel lobby,with a fully stocked bar,&semi open kitchen only viewable if you are walking by but not from eye level while seated.We saw one of their appetizers(Avocado eggrolls)on display at their curb side entrance,&decided to order that along with their Portabella Mushroom Avocado&Zucchini Fries.ALEM greeted us&asked if we would like to start out with anything to drink,we ordered our appetizers first&could decide what to drink,we asked him what was popular on the menu because this was our first time.He suggested that he put in our appetizers&2 waters first so that he would have more time to go over the menu with us.He came back with our water&then went over the menu with us.He pointed out the drink selection referencing the page numbers for the drinks&the food orders.He pointed out some specialties like the ChickenMadeira,CajunJambalayaPasta which he was able to describe in detail.He also remarked that we could not leave without first trying on of their signature cheesecakes ""anyone of their 32 flavors"".  We decided to order the ChickenMadeira&Steak Diane&their CajunJambalayaPasta.He took our order&said he was going to check on our appetizers which should be out soon.He brought out our Avocado eggrolls,then later our Portabella Mushroom Avocado&Zucchini Fries.I liked the Fries We at them&the Avocado rolls were by far tastier than the Fries.ALEM came out a little later to tell us that our main course was ready early because it took a while for our appetizers to be prepared.He asked if it would be alright to bring that out now,I said it's fine since it was already 10:45pm.We received of main courses we were surprised by the large portions in comparison to the price($$).We really liked the Steak Diane; I liked the ChickenMadeira,&enjoyed the flavor&SPICE in the CajunJambalayaPasta.  We ordered the FreshBananaCreamCheesecake&the GodivaChocolateCheesecake.He brought us our desserts after he asked if we were ready for dessert since we only had a little bit of time to eat our main courses.We knew that we would be taking everything back to our hotel anyways.Dessert was delicious.

The caveat to all this is my wish that they would stop getting rid of the cheesecakes I like best. So far the cappucino white chocolate and the white chocolate caramel latte cheesecakes have both gone the way of the dodo, and it's a complete travesty.  Sigh...  It's too bad they've got another 20 or so types or I'd really be annoyed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=220,3.24,3.09,3.09,3.2440000000000007,3.15

Like, seriously, we're here for dinner, not free therapy. After we told her THREE  times to make sure our food was warm, she disappeared for a long time and then brought out our cold pasta and frozen chicken and a soggy burger. No joke. When we called for the manager, he came by and argued with me that my food wasn't cold (he didn't even touch it) and said the chicken was perfectly cooked and he could bring out a thermometer to test  it. Have you ever?? When the food is cold, fix the bloody meal - don't argue with the customer whose waited 1.25 hours for an undercooked meal! We finally got fed up and told him to take the food away, which he did and never returned! We went to walk out and he stopped to ""explain"" how the food  was fine - again - and instead I asked for his name (Amos Machadu) to complain to the corporate offices, and he looked like he could care less.

Still, I feel 'A-OK' about The Cheesecake Factory and it's 800-page menu, its vague/non-existent disclosure of ingredients/nutritional info, etc., but again, I think it's important that a mega-chain review focus on the specific location as opposed to the chain itself. For that reason, I felt the service was adequate at this location. Food was delivered promptly and efficiently. Food was delivered mostly as ordered; salad had to be sent back due to inclusion of some things I had asked to do without. Friend's cheesecake to-go box was a strange debacle, as she wanted to box it herself, but server tried to insist he take it away to box it. The atmosphere can be loud and waits can be long, typical of most Cheesecake Factory outposts. Access from outside or inside Tyson's Galleria is convenient; it's on the 3rd floor of the mall or from the upper street level of the parking lot.

Wait staff knows their stuff and is prompt without being over-bearingly close.   I thought the holding of the chair was a nice touch.

Their bread ( sourdough and a dark oat wheat?) is still delicious. We ate the entire basket in 10 minutes. I ordered the grilled chicken this tostada salad from their lightened menu (Skinnylicious ), mom had the lunch miso salmon, and BF got the chicken Alfredo (dinner  portion so that he could the the rest home for leftovers). We were surprised that his dinner portion was not usual of Cheesecake Factory humungous notoriety. He gift his pasta first and 3 minutes later the rest of our meals came to the table. Not a big deal but it's usually not preferred to gave our entrees not to arrive at the same time. My salad was good but I had a hard time finding the chicken which only had a few chunks underneath the mound of shredded romaine lettuce. My mom's salmon looked good atop brown rice and creamy miso sauce on the bottom.

The shrimp and chicken gumbo with brown rice was quite good too! The chicken was a bit weird because the meat kind of looked like McDonalds chicken nuggets (meaning, not like chicken), but other than that, I loved the spices in this dish. A hint of spicy with a hint of sweetness. The Thai lettuce wrap, which came on a huge plate, was refreshing in comparison to the sauce-slathered gumbo. The lettuce was fresh, as were the mung bean sprouts. The three sauces (that you could add to your wrap to your choosing) perfected the dish.

The reason a 3.5 star establishment gets 1 star is the absurd corporate policy of sending out kids menu food on plates to hot to the touch. Why they cannot simply plate on regular plates is beyond me. Every time we are there with our kids, we have to send their orders back to be re-plated. As long as this continues to be corporate policy at the Cheesecake Factory, I will give everyone I eat at 1 star reviews despite the level of the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=160,3.56,3.16,3.16,2.148,3.3200000000000007

Honestly the only reason why I gave this place a 3 star was because of the cheesecakes. Without it, it would've been a 1 star. First off, our waiter forgot to put in an order for our appetizers. For entrees we had the shrimp scampi with steak diane and the chicken maderia with steak diane. The steak on both dishes was really sweet, I was kinda hoping for something a bit more savory. The chicken tasted like what you would get on an airplane and the shrimp was pretty good. The only bright side from our night was the cheesecakes. We had the vanilla bean and  chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake. The vanilla bean cheesecake tasted like a vanilla milkshake which was surprisingly good. And the chocolate tuxedo was the bomb, an absolute must get if you come here. Overall I would come back, but only for their cheesecakes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=240,3.56,3.16,3.16,2.348,3.3200000000000007

We could have finished our meal probably 10-15 minutes sooner if he hadn't of kept disappearing. I had a vanilla milkshake to drink and I have to say it was near perfection. I think the best milkshake I've ever had. I had the buffalo burger which was delicious, I just wish there were a few more fries to accompany it. My wife, as always, had the marsala, which is enough for 2 meals and I'm told was delicious. We shared a piece of the s'mores cheesecake for dessert and could only manage half of it each before giving up! As always, the cheesecake was excellent.

Wasn't impressed this time, actually disappointed this time. A cheese pizza was ordered, and my sister said it made her stomach hurt. Also ordered fish tacos(includes beans and rice) Which was alright, but not that hot. (Could tell they waited for all the dishes to come out, because the tacos weren't as hot, as i would prefer.) I ordered a chicken dish with a cream sauce and tomatoes. Sounded good,  as i was trying to pick a pasta dish that didn't have cheese in it, as I'm allergic. The dish came nice and hot, but covered in cheese. (I didn't know when I ordered it, otherwise wouldn't have gotten it.) The waitress came over and said there's no cheese in that dish, well obviously there was, you could smell and see it. But she was nice enough to take it back and off the final check. I ordered white chicken chili, which usually I LOVE. But this time it was just awful. Was not chili, as the taste was very brothy(like soup). Tasted like they didn't have enough chili, so to do things quickly, they poured over chicken and rice soup over it( which is what it tasted like)I'm not a soup person, or do i like both/soupy things. Yuck, absolutely disgusting. Ate some, but was totally grossed out. Payed, and ended up going to Baja fresh near our house. Overall, won't be back anytime soon.

I guess I had high expectations for a simple salad; definitely won't make that mistake again. So this is what happened!  A Greek salad is comprised with Romaine, onions, olives, bell peppers, cucumber, tomatoes and feta cheese. Whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, black pepper, pour the dressing, toss and serve (sounds easy enough) So I ordered a salad; all I wanted was Romain lettuce, feta cheese, grilled chicken breast and some salad dressing. Nothing too complex like ordering smoked halibut, filet mignon or even tuna tartare. Just a simple Greek salad!.... Where do I begin this review? Let's start off with the waiter shall we?  One; she didn't greet us when we sat down on the table, Two; I asked what's the specialty today? she couldn't recommend a Single dish on the menu, Three; (The restaurant usually serves warm wheat and white bread as a starter /appetizer so customers wouldn't get hungry while waiting for the main dish).... We were served hard cold bread, Four; 25 minutes later! she finally brings out our soft drinks, Five; coming from the Arctic kitchen she then brings out the food to the table. That's when everything went downhill from there. First off the chicken in my salad was raw and there was no feta cheese or salad dressing. My friend who was visiting DC from California; her nachos were frozen like our waiters attitude!.... Not once did the waiter come back to check in on us.  After all this frustration I asked to see the manager! (This should be interesting!) I expressed to the manager on duty that our service and food were both unacceptable. She replied stating ""I do apologize sir for any inconvenience that has occurred tonight is completely my fault"" (i'm glad there's an adult working here who realized this wasn't acceptable). She did apologize and recognized how disrespectful and rude our waiter was and offered to replace my meal only (not including my friends dish) and add a complementary cheesecake slice. I refused and replied ""you need to understand the situation, it's not about getting a free meal it's about managing your staff and serving your customers needs at best"". ""Is this not in Tysons Galleria? I receive better customer service at Harris Teeter's salad bar"". ""This is the Cheesecake Factory! your level of customer service is poorly represented and needs to change before you lose more and more customers in the future"". 15 minutes pass-by nothing happens?

We also had the Grande Burrito, and sadly it also shrank, we received a half of what it used to be.   Then they pour tomato sauce on top, and inside instead of the rice and cilantro sauce it was tomato sauce inside.  We were charged $15 for Mini Burritos and $13 for the not so beefy hamburger. The Cheesecake ingredients had dropped dramatically, instead of fresh cream they are using vegetable oil, vegetable shortening.  We got sick of them and their Carrot Cake crumbles although frozen.  Not Acceptable for the prices charged.

What makes this place great is that it's good for groups, their menus are extensive, and the portions are ever so generous for the price. They also have a skinny menu! (But it's not that much of a health conscious difference.)  However, in my opinion the quality of their food is just OK. I've had plenty of dishes from here from pastas, salads, cheesecakes (obviously their staple), etc. I'm unsure if they use frozen products, but something is always off for me. I want to love this place, but I always end up having an average experience. This time around I ordered the herb-crusted salmon salad- my salmon was cooked pretty well but it, along with my vegetables (not talking about the lettuce)-- was pretty much tasteless.

There's no doubt they call it 'Cheesecake Factory' as the cheesecake is SUPERB! I'm not kidding..I don't see how NY cheesecake is that much better. In fact, the oreo dream extreme cheesecake here is out of this world!!! Rich fudgy milk chocolate frosting, creamy original cheesecake, THE BEST OREO MOUSSE, and chocolate cake into one. If this doesn't describe heaven, I don't know what does. I've also had the pumpkin cheesecake which is excellent! Rich but not overpowering.  The bread they bring you here is to die for! Sometimes the servers are a bit slow to bring the bread, but don't be shy and get your bread! It's too good in fact whenever I'm here I ask for an extra basket. :) The basket comes with brown and white bread, and the brown is my fave. It's like a sweeter bread, I always ask for more!! Onto the food, I've only had the pizza which is actually pretty good. I know people would probably think pizza from here is mediocre, but it's actually good. The crab cake appetizer is AMAZING!! You have to try this. They come with 6 mini crab cake bites, which are perfectly fried and steaming hot. No joke, I think they're better than the crab cakes at The Palm. Now I only wish they had this as an entree...they probably do. The only downside is that they usually give you a table in the dark, so I have to always request to change it. Sometimes the staff aren't too nice about that and make you wait a bit longer.

After waiting another 30 minutes, our kids' meals and salads came. One kid's meal was totally wrong, one was missing the side dish, and a salad had the wrong dressing. After another half hour, our entrees were served. One entree was missing a substitution, one entree had the wrong side dish, and one entree had overcooked/stale rice that was inedible.  Just to summarize, out of 9 items that were ordered, 2 were correct and 7 were wrong, and the wait time to get our incorrect entrees was 1.5 hours. I had to send my entree back and instead of remaking it, they removed the incorrect item and gave it back to me. It was served completely cold.  I found the restaurant manager and notified him of all the problems we had encountered during our visit. Neither the manager nor the server apologized for the poor service, the service did not improve after I complained, and we were not given any credit or discount off our check or offered a free desert or anything like that.  We were at the restaurant a total of 2.5 hours due to the slowness of getting our check and getting our credit cards back.

I was told to try back in an hour. At 10:30am, I was told to try back around 11:30am. I called again at 11:40am and was told he's still not there and to try back later. Nobody seemed to know when the general manager would be present. I called again at 1pm and was told he's busy and would have to call me back. I find the service we experienced to be offensive and unforgivable. I also find it disturbing that the manager made no attempt to rectify the situation.

So I figured the staff would see new people at the table and stop by. It took 20 minutes for them to come to the table. I ordered a soda and a cocktail, the cocktail which I waited another 20 minutes for, having to flag down and remind the server, which by this point we had almost received our food. I'm a light drinker and appreciate drinking my cocktail throughout the whole dining experience, not having to chug it all at once to get it in before I leave. I expect it get within 5 to 10 minutes of ordering. He didnt even ask if there was anything else he could get us, refills, bread, nothing, so inefficient .  While ordering food, my mother asked a question about the style of sauce a pasta dish came with- instead of finishing the order and finding out after, then coming back to confirm- the server turned his back and walked away from the table!  My fiance WANTED to order a chicken sandwich but wanted his sauce on the side, the waiter acted like he was stupid, pressing him to order something else that HE HIMSELF thought he should order, finally my fiance gave in and ordered the chicken littles to avoid further argument and frustrations. Maybe suggest something but don't force a change of mind on a customer.  My pasta alfredo- A watered down, broken/split (oil separated from milk product) supposed ""parmesan"" sauce/liquid which tasted of raw garlic, burning on my lips. There is no place for raw garlic in a fully cooked dish. When he delivered the food he came back with parmesan to grate, after that we didnt seem him ever again. He didn't come to ask if everything was ok or anything. It was almost like he would do anything to be away from the table, to get away as fast as possible. My family- including my fiance was satisfied with their meals.  My fiance asked for a box so the waiter brought 4 boxes. I didnt want to take anything home, as I was incredibly dissatisfied with my meal, which the waiter didn't know because he didnt care to ask. The waiter didnt just joke with me about leaving my plate but literally paused and told me ""how could you waste food like that? I would never leave that much food on the table. You can't just leave that, it's such a waste.""  Im sorry, im the one paying, and I paid for food that I didnt like. Maybe, if I barely ate anything, you should: ask if it's ok, if I enjoyed my meal, why I didn't enjoy it, what can I do to make it better.  But no I got a lecture on my wasteful ways.  How dare you force your views on a customer, how dare you force a customer to do something they don't want to. This led to my dad taking it home for my brother to shut him the hell up.  This is also what led me to write the review. I will not be told by my server that I have to take food home. All in all he was extremely unattentive and extremely rude when actually taking orders.  4 of us sat in a booth big enough for 2 people and the lights dimmed so we could barely read the dessert menu.

At this point the service was ""acceptably bad"" but then deteriorated into ""horrible"". The manager came by.  We explained the order had been sent back.  It had been about 10 minutes (my 11 year old son sitting next to me starving and waiting).  He said he just saw it enter the kitchen and it would be at least 10 more minutes before we got more food (ended up being closer to 15, total 25 minutes).  Not sure why it took our waiter 10 minutes to carry a plate back to the kitchen.  We complained that this was too long and he got defensive saying that he never sends out food that is not freshly cooked etc.  Never made eye contact, never apologized.  He left and we felt worse than before he showed up. He did comp us for that dish. The kids started to melt down, so we finally took the rest of the food to go.  We ordered a piece of ""plain classic"" cheesecake to take with us. After 10 more minutes the waiter came by to tell us that they were out of this.  Think of that, the Cheesecake Factory, out of cheesecake.  But, he said, we could order the cheesecake with strawberry sauce, with the sauce on the side, and that was the same cheesecake as the plain cheesecake.  Good thing he made us wait 10 minutes to tell us that.  We ordered, and finally 10-15 minutes later (total time about 2.5 hours) we got out of there. No eye contact, no apology, no human emotion whatsoever. The food, overall, is pretty good, and so are the drinks, so I give them 2 stars.  But probably the worst service you're going to get anywhere in the DC area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=220,2.44,3.16,3.16,2.3760000000000003,2.8720000000000003

The menu has more than 250 items (crazy right @__@), so it has great variety; however, for an indecisive person like me -- it's a struggle choosing something *sobs* We ended up waiting about 30-40 minutes for food (but probably because we had such a big group). I ended up eating the Tuscan Chicken, and also mooched off the Four Cheese Pasta my friends got. The food was good, but nothing too special. The Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake is AMAZING though. It may have been too sweet for some of my friends, but anything with oreos is just godly *^* Our waitress was great, I loved her attitude and she was really nice to all of us. I can't imagine having to serve 17 people or even more... The Cheesecake Factory is also great because they're more then willing to make modifications to your food. For example; you can ask for them to prepare your meal without added salt, have the dish come with another pair of sides, etc. Also, they give HUGE proportions so you're definitely getting your money's worth!

A little while later, our waiter came by and dropped off the menus and whisked away without asking if we needed anything to drink. He returned about ten minutes later and proceeded to ask what we'd like to drink. He took 15 minutes to return with the drinks and the Sierra Mist was extremely flat and distasteful. He took our drinks back, returned 10 minutes later, and left once more to tend to another table. It took a while before he came back to our table to take our order. When he finally made it, he took our menus and asked if we'd like refills. When he did, we asked if we could get bread for the table as well. It didn't take him as long this time around, but when he returned with the drinks, he was in such a frenzy, he spilled drink on me while refilling my cup. He didn't offer paper towel or additional napkin. He just took off to take care of another table at the far end. When our food finally came, one of my friend's meal wasn't the correct order. The food did not  belong to another table either, so we had to wait some more. After we were done eating, he came by pretty quickly with the check and returned our cards back to us in far less time it took for him to actually serve the table. He still got a tip of course, but after this experience, I don't believe we will ever return to this location for dine-in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=140,2.48,2.94,2.94,2.084,2.7560000000000002
111,Bob T.,"Arlington, VA",90,225,267.0,1.0,2015-09-26,"It has been a long time since I ate at a Cheesecake Factory.  Thanks to this meal it will be longer still before I try again. There were four of us, three adults and my 7-year old daughter.  None of us walked away having enjoyed anything we ordered. The food is still dished out in portions so generous as to border on the absurd.  However, the flavors and presentation were anywhere from bland to yucky.  For example, my bacon bacon cheeseburger (not a typo, it has two different kinds of bacon) tasted just OK.  I finished it and would not order it again.  My desert, a Warm Apple Crisp, was a gummy mess.  Nothing about it was the least bit crispy.  The only thing differentiating the apples, ""crisps"", and ice cream was the temperature.  I could only stomach a few bites and would never consider ordering it again.   The thing that pushed the meal over the edge, plummeting towards atrociousness, was my daughter's dessert.  She wanted the 7-layer chocolate cake, and I couldn't see plopping something that huge in front of a child.  So, I asked the waiter to serve her half and put the rest in a box.  He brought it to our table as the entire slice in a box.   When I asked him about it, he said serving the cake as an entire slice was a presentation issue and the kitchen staff refused to cut it in half as I requested.  When I spoke to the manager, he said the same thing. Between the (at best) mediocre food and a host of other service issues the meal already stank.  This last thing, refusing a perfectly reasonable request, was just icing on what turned out to be an overly-sweetened and otherwise flavorless piece of cake. I also noticed something a bit underhanded.  If you split the check and don't stop to think you will be overtipping... big time.  Their credit card slips come with three pre-calculated tip amounts to save the effort of calculating the tip.  The problem is if you ask them to split the charge between credit cards, the calculated tips provided are still against the original total.  For example, my credit card slip was for $53 and the ""Suggested Gratuity"" of 20% was listed at $21.20.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=60,2.48,2.9,2.9,2.148,2.732

4,Susan H.,"Reston, VA",452,634,1111.0,3.0,2015-10-15,"This Cheesecake Factory was the first one we went to.  When it opened, it was crazy busy for a long time so we waited until the hype died down.  We had high expectations after hearing how good the food was and the cheesecakes were the best.  I'll give them that---their cheesecakes are great!  The food...well...it's not outstanding. We hadn't been to a Cheesecake factory in years.  This past Sunday we were at the Galleria and decided to go as it is one of the cheapest places to have dinner in the mall.   We were there around 5 p.m. and the place was doing a brisk business.  Once seated, our server was prompt getting to our table.  We gave our drink orders.  I had a mixed drink, I think the name was JW's lemonade.  It turned out to be a decent well made drink with good flavor.  My husband had a Coors Light. I had my eye on the 1/2 sandwich and soup menu item.  That is, until I found out that there is only 1 soup available and it changes daily.  The soup of the day was chicken soup with artichokes and mushrooms, so I gave it a pass.  I ended up ordering the chicken salad sandwich which consists of:  ""housemade with roasted almonds, lettuce, tomato and mayo on grilled brioche bread"".  For a side, I chose fries.   My husband ordered a turkey club sandwich only to have our server come back to our table to tell us that the restaurant was out of turkey.  Seriously?  It sounds like the culinary manager isn't on top of things.  So, he ordered an old fashioned burger which consists of:  ""charbroiled on a toasted brioche bun with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles and mayo""  For his side, he chose carrots. The chicken salad sandwich was huge!  I guess no one makes normal sized sandwiches anymore!  It didn't hold together well and was rather messy to eat.  The almonds, while sparsely present, did add a nice crunch.  One half of the sandwich oddly had a spicy taste that shouldn't have been there.  The fries were dry and flavorless. My husband said his burger was good.  It was cooked as he ordered and he did enjoy it saying he liked the charbroiled flavor. We didn't get any cheesecake.  However, in the past when we've gone to the Cheesecake factory, we have ordered some to go.  Every time we've had some, we've never been disappointed. I suppose that we will go again sometime.  One thing I've never liked about them---their menu is like a book.  So, it's best to decide beforehand if you want a main course meal, a sandwich, burger or flatbread, etc.  as it will be easier to narrow it down. Before the tip, dinner cost $42 + change.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=40,2.4,2.87,2.87,2.444,2.6820000000000004

145,Sarah F.,"Fairfax, VA",57,32,7.0,1.0,2015-10-22,"We had a really disappointing experience at the Tyson's location tonight. For starters, the restaurant was absolutely freezing, and we were sat directly behind a server station where servers found it appropriate to discuss tips and customers directly in front of us. Further, the other server in our station was laughing, shouting, and clapping so loudly you would have thought he was at a standup comedy show. Our server, on the other hand, seemed half awake, and dropped the ball on several items. We specifically asked for a soup entree to split, followed by another entree to split. We were then served one bowl of soup (with no soup spoons). We waited several minutes to ask our server for an extra bowl and soup spoons, but she was nowhere to be found, so we gave up and attempted to share it across the table with our teaspoons. Several waitstaff passed us clearly looking like we needed something, and nobody checked in. Then, our second entree arrived (orange chicken, also on a single plate rather than split as requested) and when our server finally brought us an extra plate, it was completely filthy and covered in what appeared to be crusted over olive oil. The chicken was beyond disappointing, and my husband almost swallowed a hunk of bone in on of the pieces. We told the server and pointed out the bone, but she didn't offer to bring a replacement entree, nor did a manager come by. Of all the times to at LEAST do a table touch, that would have been it. The only saving grace for the meal was the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake, which was very good. Honestly, a decent meal with good service should not be that difficult.

108,Sana S.,"Sterling, VA",199,169,315.0,1.0,2015-10-29,"Went there for a birthday lunch with 5 of my coworkers. We were seated promptly, but it all went downhill from there.  Our server Rahul, was very forgetful. I had to ask at least 3 times for bread and each time he reacted as if he had never heard me say it before. After about 15 minutes he finally brought us our bread and water, which he had to make multiple trips for. Not sure what the delay was, the restaurant was not packed at all and the other servers around us seemed to be more responsive to their tables.  It took another 20 minutes before the drinks we ordered arrived. Then, we sat for 40 minutes waiting for our food to come, I had to go up to the hostess and ask for a manager because the wait time was just ridiculous.  The manager appologized stating that one of the orders, a burger was overcooked. Regardless I don't understand how that would result in 40 minutes. We watched parties who had arrived after us eat and leave before us, that's how slow the service was for our table. Finally the food came out, but not even all of it. Two plates at a time with about 10 minutes in between. All of our entrees were freezing cold and had clearly been sitting under the heat lamps as they were slightly warm on the surface. We refused to eat our meals. The mananger came over and was extremely flustered. He had no idea how to handle the situation and at one point walked away while I was speaking to him. Not only that, but he reiterated and became frustrated that we were complaining since he had told us about the burger needing to be recooked. He later offered to remake our meals, but after an hour and half wasted, we just had zero patience or desire to eat there anymore. He stated he would take all of the food off our bill and that we were only responsible for the drinks. Took another 15 minutes for the check to come and for the server to process it, we were so frustrated that we almost walked out.  Upon leaving, the server offered us a slice of cheescake. I politely refused. A complimentary slice of cheescake does not make up for the 2 hours wasted.  Thanks Cheescake Factory for your extremely poor service and managment. I wish I had gotten the managers name, but I have no idea how he can run a restaurant, I have never experienced such poor managment skills, or honestly lack there of. Also, thanks for not only ruining my birthday lunch, but lunch hour for 5 of my coworkers.

Interesting to go to the Cheesecake factory after hearing about it in my life whether its from the Big Bang Theory or elsewhere. In any case, TBBT is inaccurate on the depiction of the Cheesecake factory.  It was a party of 8. For appetizers we had nachos, summer rolls, and wontons. The nachos were ok albeit I've had better. The wontons also ok. The summer rolls very subpar. Whoever had the idea to put shrimp and noodles in a spring roll wrapper to create this particular summer roll is clearly an idiot.  My party had crab cakes, steak, pasta, and some other items. For the most part, everybody liked their entrees. I had a crusted salmon kale salad. It was very good. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the kale was sliced well. The dressing was also good. Overall, entrees were good. Everybody got cheesecake to go. I had the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee cheesecake. It was good, but could have certainly had a stronger coffee or kahlua taste to it. The sweetness of the chocolate overwhelmed the other two flavors. Nevertheless I enjoyed it.  Would probably go to the Cheesecake factory again. Its semi-affordable for the area and a decent value. Service was good, my water was refilled.

Okay, so we'll start with the good. The cheesecake was great. Especially the banana, which actually tasted awesome. The food was pretty good. I got the garlic pasta, which was good. My girlfriend got the jambalaya, which tasted nothing like jambalaya, and although it says spicy, we ended up putting in a ton of Sriracha when we got home.  Then came our waiter.  Ricky R, from what it says on our receipt.  We had no bread to start. He came by when we weren't ready, I began to request which appetiser to start us off, he interrupted me to interject and ask what my girlfriend's sister wanted first. Okay, I'm all for ladys first, but I was trying to get us started with an appetiser because they still couldn't decide what they wanted. We ordered drinks, and I had finished mine before the appetiser came out, but it wasn't taken away until after the dinner. Asked for bread which came out after the appetiser. He proceeds to spend the rest of the meal not speaking to me at all, but to my girlfriend, until he brings out the check. At which time, I open it to see that he put a line next to the 20%, and a ""THANKS"" right beside it? I'm sorry, but where was the service that you provided me that was so great that you felt entitled enough to presume you were getting a 20% tip? I'm going to follow this up with the fact that my girlfriend works in the service industry as well, so whenever we go out, we tip at least 20%. More of the person was great, and genuine, but the least we will tip is 15% of the person was just awful and didn't care at all.  I know it seems like I'm getting worked up over nothing, and I've had a lot of bad service before due to the fact that I seem a bit younger, but the part that really bothers me is that he had the audacity to insinuate that I was required to give him a higher percentage tip when we started off the meal with him interrupting me, which he never even acknowledged. Then, he clearly didn't pay attention to our table since we had no bread to start, it took the whole bloody meal for my empty drink to be taken away, and when we asked for the dessert menu, he came back with two which he presented to my girlfriend and her sister. I ended up tipping over 20% because the food was not when it came out, and if I weren't in the equation, my girlfriend and her sister got pretty good service.

302,Nia S.,"Woodbridge, VA",1,11,14.0,2.0,2016-03-26,"WARNING: REAL & HONEST REVIEW(CONTINUE TO READ AT YOUR OWN RISK) Went shopping around the tysons corner area today and decided to stop and have lunch at the cheesecake factory. I must say i had an overall weird experience. My waiter was very unusual and creepy acting. He was attentive to every table he was serving except for ours. I had to get his attention numerous times for drink refills and a check, even though he was very assisting to the other tables. He was somewhat nice but his actions were rude. I'm starting to think his lack of assistance had something to do with my mother and I. Not sure what we did, but it felt personal :/ I shouldnt have to feel that way leaving any establishment.  I usually like cheesecake factory food, but at this one, it was not so great. I ordered simple and got a pepperoni pizza with a side of fries. My mother ordered some sort of tamale. My pizza was poorly made and cheese wasnt covered on a part of it. Also my fries were partially burnt. HOW CAN YOU MESS UP FRENCH FRIES? My mothers tamale had a very foul odor. Almost a  ""musk"" kind of smell. We had went to another cheesecake factory over at potomac mills a couple weeks back and it had absolutely no foul odor. We did not order any dessert because of the much time wasted while the waiter was getting the check. Wish i could tell you his name but he didnt even tell us...  The cheesecake factory has terrible wait times. Plus it was a saturday evening so i was expecting to be sitting and waiting for a table for atleast half an hour. But to my surprise, we were seated immediately. Hardly anyone was there and practically some areas were empty. (WHICH IS WHY I DONT KNOW WHY THE WAITER SUCKED) A couple that had just been seated a few tables back yelled at my waiter and was very frustrated for no one assisting them. They had been sitting there for quite some time now, and i could see their faces starting to frown. At the same time, waiters a few feet behind them were slacking and having side conversations and giggling while they could have helped that couple. Overall, the staff needs to be more attentive.  I will try my best to avoid coming back to this crusty beat down over priced establishment again. Please do the same. I know many more clean cheesecake factories that will actually NOTICE you are there(Potomac Mills one isnt so bad) I will not be surprised when this establishment gains a bad reputation. The waiters there just dont care.. I will be more than happy to take my hard earned money and spend it at a mcdoanlds that knows how to properly run a restaurant than this place. EDIT: My waiters name was Rahul! His deep voice is very prominant(You'll know when its him) I see other yelpers have had bad experiences with him too. I suggest you request another waiter if you receive him. No shade to Rahul, but if youre reading this...YOU SUCK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=120,2.64,2.62,2.976,1.9920000000000002,2.628
352,Amy J.,"West Babylon, NY",40,5,,2.0,2016-04-02,"I'm visiting the area for the weekend and I had never been to The Cheesecake Factory before. This one is located inside the Tysons Galleria which is a very upscale shopping mall attached to the Ritz Carlton. I was very optimistic based on the location and appearance at first glance. I stopped in with my boyfriend on a Saturday afternoon and we were seated right away. As soon as he sat down in the booth, his hand landed in what appeared to be melted cheesecake that was on the seat. Our silverware was set on the bare table and one of the spoons had what looked like caramel on it and there was also some in the middle of the table. They obviously didn't clean it after the previous guests and also didn't bother removing the dirty silverware and apparently expected us to eat with it and not notice. I was very turned off and considered leaving right then. Instead, when our server came over to greet us we asked for clean utensils and to have the table wiped. He was very apologetic and took care of it. We ordered a mojito and an old fashioned, the roadhouse sliders and meatballs with ricotta and garlic bread. Our server, Andrew, asked if we would like bread for the table and I said yes. Things were looking up. Andrew brought us some water while we were waiting for our cocktails (which was very thoughtful because the drinks were taking forever) and some bread and butter. The drinks took a good 10 minutes to arrive but when they did they looked fantastic and they were delicious and worth the wait. We took a few bites of the bread when we noticed a long dark hair in it. At this point I was done. When Andrew passed by again, we showed him the hair and I told him we wanted to pay for our drinks and leave. And that is what we did. I work in a restaurant myself so I understand that things happen sometimes. But this place didn't even try. Andrew and the drinks get a thumbs up but everything else blew.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=220,2.64,2.6,2.972,2.056,2.616

So even a manager couldn't assist with adjusting the price enlight of what happened??? Guess bugs are just business as usual at this made it worst was there was no formal apology for what I experienced. It was dismissed like this happens all of the time, because it comes directly from the farm (don't you inspect and rinse you food) . That is not a good excuse for a bug being in my food, if I did not inspect my food then I was eating it I would have eaten a ladybug with my salad.

Both of us were starving and blew through the bread basket quickly. At every single other Cheesecake Factory location, we've always been asked if we want more bread. Here, I pushed the empty bread basket so it was hanging off the edge of our booth.

Meanwhile, I was admiring the next table's ultra-professional server. With an attitude like that, I'd rather just buy the cheesecake directly from the cake window.  The service at the cake display window is top notch. At least that made up for the food service.  Also, the ThyssenKrupp hydraulic elevators are pretty nice to experience, and convenient (and snazzy, i guess) to get to the restaurant from the main level.  At their cheesecake slice prices, though, I'd consider other dessert options within the mall. Update: I tried the Salted Caramel cheesecake, per recommendation.

Appetizer, entree, and two slices of cheesecake at $50+ with tax and tip (no drinks, or extras). It's not inexpensive.  Avocado egg rolls came out soggy and just a sprinkle of the rice straws. Presentation looked sad.  Bang Bang chicken and shrimp would be better called 'rice mountain' with 4 pieces of shrimp and sporadic chicken pieces smothered in the sauce. Also, poorly presented.  They are always busy here so I don't imagine they are paying a lot of attention to the reviews, but in case they start to loose activity and decide to consider some opportunities for feedback, maybe they will come across this and others on Yelp and seriously consider re-upping their game.

Our dinner started out with extremely slow service. We were seated immediately but waited 15 minutes for a server to even greet us. I'm used to being offered bread as soon as the waiter greets us but we were offered none so we asked for some. No biggie, except for the fact that it took another 10-15 minutes to get our bread. Our server wasn't even the one who brought it out. We asked for more bread when we ran out but he didn't bring it by the time we got our entrees so we didn't bother asking again.  Now this is the kicker, when I received my meal (shrimp scampi and steak Diane combo) my portion was TINY. LIKE RIDICULOUSLY SMALL. I thought Cheesecake Factory was known for huge portion sizes? I had even asked the general size of a steak Diane when I ordered and the estimate he showed me was way bigger than what I got. My friend had also gotten a steak Diane combo and her portion was about twice the size of mine.  I'm not much for confrontation but I asked my friends if I should tell the waiter and they said yes. We tried to flag him down but he was literally nowhere to be found. We proceeded to stand up in our booth and try to flag down any other waiter but no one even looked at us, no joke. We decided to put the steak aside until we could find him and ask him about it. By the time he actually came by our table we were finished with everything except the steak. I pointed out the portion difference as politely as I possibly could because I didn't want him to think I was blaming him (it's not like the waiter controls how the food is cooked). He said he could see what I was saying and what I would like to do. I told him a few more pieces of steak would be perfect, just enough so mine and my friends portion sizes were even. He said he would go and try to get me some (which I appreciated) and left to the kitchen.  When he came back he finally gave us the bread we were waiting for (took him long enough) then told me the most bullshit excuse ever. He said ""what had happened was they weighed the portions but I'll bring you out some more anyways"". Now this pissed me off. At the very least they could apologize then bring me the extra steak but no, instead they acted as if I was seeing things and nothing was wrong. I asked my friends if our portions looked even close to the same weight and they said absolutely not it was an obvious lie. This alone made my dinner the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE EVER. I can't stand for companies who blame their customers for problems and make lame excuses to save their asses. I got my extra pieces of steak in the end but I was already annoyed. If you want slow service and to be ripped off with extremely small portion sizes then blamed for it, come here.

I stick with my go to which is the Cajun jambalaya pasta.  I was thinking I can't go wrong with fresh pasta, shrimp and chicken in a Cajun sauce.  Except I was wrong because it wasn't that great.  The dish was watery tasting and didn't have enough of a Cajun flavor.  My pasta was overcooked and borderline mushy.  The shrimp and chicken were okay.  I just remembered that this used to be one of the best dishes I ever had but now it is not that good. We also got the egg roll platter which was pretty good, all different kinds of egg rolls.  The avocado one was really good. My cousin order the bang bang chicken and shrimp and it was disappointing.  I think the chef changed the recipe because from what I remembered it was a red coconut curry sauce filled with veggies.  This time it was yellow with shredded zucchini and carrots.

At 9pm it was still pretty packed, so business must be good. I've never seen an empty Cheesecake Factory! We couldn't resist the tiramisu cheesecake, and it was even better because we had a $5 off coupon. The total came out to about $3.50, so there's no beating that. We also had a kahlua cocoa coffee cheesecake (as well as another $5 coupon!). Out of the two, I certainly enjoyed the tiramisu more. I have a bias, however, because I already happen to love tiramisu. It was light and fluffy and not too sweet. The kahlua cocoa coffee cheesecake would've been more enjoyable if it were more coffee than cocoa. The chocolate/fudge flavor was too much for my liking, and it would've been tastier if it were 70/30 coffee/cocoa. That's up to each individual's liking, though, so no stars deducted for that. Good value overall because of the two $5 coupons. $8.50 for a slice is a bit too much for my taste, so I probably wouldn't get future slices without coupons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=20,2.4,2.45,2.904,2.416,2.43

We were told that there was no table ready for us. After waiting for twenty minutes they brought us to a groups of tiny tables in the bar section that had been pushed together, instead of seating us in the dining room. After we placed our orders, we waited for awhile. The waiter only brought entrees for two of the people in our group. The rest of us sat there for another half hour waiting for our meals.  I ordered one of the simplest entrees to prepare, fettuccini Alfredo. The waiter brought a large plate of over cooked pasta. When I tasted it it was literally a mouthful of flour. It took a long time for the waiter to return to our section, and he was ignoring us. When he finally came to our table I told him that the Alfredo sauce was missing from my dish. He did not take the dish and he left the area again.  After another long wait we motioned to the waiter. I told him once again that the dish needed the sauce. Again he left without taking the dish. After another long wait we asked another waiter for the Alfedo sauce. By now everyone else had eaten their entree. Our waiter finally appeared with a very small container of a basic white sauce, not Alfedo sauce, which contains cheese.  There was another long wait to hail the waiter. This time I picked the dish up and handed it to him and said to bring it back to the kitchen for Alfredo sauce. When the dish came out it had the same tasteless basic white sauce with no cheese in it, not Alfedo sauce. By now everyone else was well into their desserts, and I gave up on dinner.

We never got refills and had to ask for napkins and their complimentary bread.  Regardless, the three stars are for the food. My family started off with buffalo wings and fried calamari. While the calamari was crispy and tasty, the buffalo wings were tiny and over fried. I had a wing with only one bite, and at a price of $12.50 for 10 wings and wilting celery sticks, this was a disappointment. Then our entrees came, and I became even more disappointed! I had ordered the bistro shrimp pasta, one of my go-to dishes, only to discover there was no cream sauce added. I had to wait for them to bring out sauce only to have them bring out a tomato sauce! By the time I received my lemon-garlic cream sauce, everyone else was near finished with their meals. I did have my entree comped, so that was a pleasant surprise, but still. My mother's Cajun jambalaya shrimp pasta was delicious and flavorful as usual, with plenty of shrimp and soft noodles. Also be prepared to get their Bang Bang chicken and shrimp curry. It's an unappetizing bowl of rice sitting in a puddle of curry and meat chunks. I'm sure it tasted good though, since my uncle finished it.  For the desserts, we ordered the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake and the Chocolate Mousse. Both were too airy and not creamy enough. Whether it was the warm temperature of the cheesecakes or overwhelming amount of whip cream sprayed on top, we weren't pleased with their signature dessert!

I heard from a friend how great the experience was using the app and had to see for myself.  Service and food were very good. I've always found Cheesecake Factory to be pretty consistent in both of those areas. I tend not to go there much because the portions are just too large.  After we were seated I checked in on the CakePay app and it generated a four digit code that I gave to the server. A few minuets after he took our order the items showed up in the app.  We shared the the Crispy Chicken Costoletta and it was tasty. Liked the mashed potatoes that came with it and the asparagus was okay.  Love the size of the glasses which meant it was easy for the waiter to keep up with my ice tea consumption.  Had the Pumpkin Cheesecake to finish off the meal. Another tasty dessert.  All of the items showed up in the app very quickly after being ordered and I hit the pay button, was offered an option to split the bill and add a gratuity and swipe to pay with Apple Pay.  The app presented an option to provide feedback which consisted of a star rating and a yes/no on whether I would use the system again (YES).

But unfortunately yesterday I came with a group of close friends to celebrate the arrival of my baby girl. We all had a bad experience we wanted to walk out because we waited for water and our drinks for about 20-25 minutes. Later our appetizers came late then our other appetizer came 20 mins later. We had to tell our server that we didn't get our appetizer. He not once bother to check up on us. Don't know what he was doing but horrible service. Afterwards we waited an hour and a half for our food. Our food order was not hard at all. It was ridiculous that he did not even bother to check on the food. Then my friends again ordered 2 mojitos and once again it took another 20/25 minutes to come out. We were so upset we didn't even wanna order cheesecake because that was going to take another 30 minutes.!

They don't take reservations. That's a disappointment.  The entrance to the restaurant was not welcoming because it was noisy and overflowing with people waiting to be seated. Further, the lighting was too dim.  When we were finally seated, the service was OK. The place was a bit noisy so we even had trouble being heard when placing our order. The dishes were good, and the key lime cheesecake especially great. After all it's their namesake. Their crispy pineapple chicken and shrimp was tasty (sweet and slightly spicy). The portion of rice was huge though. A friend had their broccoli steak which is great. I had never heard of that dish before. The crab cake (as an entree) was simple but good.  The lighting in the dining area was too dim. This is probably because we were tucked away in a corner (in a booth). I do love their booth seating.

But we weren't bothered by that at all we understood that it was busy and it's hard to find a large table like that at that time. Also the hosts was extremely nice she kept us updated on our table, and we really appreciated that. So after we got our table our server came by I didn't see him greet anyone just started taking drinks orders. He looked tired and had a long day and he looked busy. So he got the drinks order took about 15 minutes to get us waters he got drinks for half the table and left the other half until he remembered. He wasn't very attentive barely came to check up on us I got frustrated a little and told him we are ready to order now. So he took our orders and left. My friend tried to call on him while he's walking by and asked him ""excuse me sir can I get"" and the server replied ""yeah yeah"" and kept walking away he didn't even stop to ask what he wanted and didn't even let him finish what he wanted. My friend wanted more bread, he brought out the bread after a while, didn't even ask if we needed butter and ran off. The drinks from the bar took around 30 minutes to come out. By the time we got our food everyone was starving. I got the chicken Riesling that was on the speciality it was amazing. But the disappointing part was our server didn't come around and check if we wanted parmesan cheese and did ask how our food was, I know one person on the table didn't like their pasta much.  So my friend kept calling on him saying ""hey sir can we please get some Parmesan cheese"" my friend asked him twice because of how he never came to our table but to just take orders. So the server reply okay with a little attitude and while he was walking away he shook his head at us! Like seriously!! I wasn't sure who's serving whom at that moment. I had 3 years serving experience and never seen such a rude server! I would've not wrote this review if he didn't shake his head at us, because I understand how tough the job can be.

The food itself was poorly prepared, because I ordered my usual favorite dish, the Factory Nachos, and some tortilla chips were overly baked and a nearly burnt dark brown, with not enough sour cream, salsa or guacamole. The lighting in the restaurant is way too dim, as if they're trying to hide unsanitary and poorly cleaned conditions. Before we left the restaurant, we visited the pastry section where customers can buy cheesecake desserts to take home. After she saw that we didn't leave her a tip, Linda marched over to the pastry area and gave us a dirty look, as if she was trying to chase us out with intimidation. I discreetly asked another employee if I could speak to her manager, and I described to him the terrible experience we had due to Linda's incompetent, hostile behavior. I told him that I didn't want to get her in trouble, but maybe someone could gently remind her that it is her job to be courteous and polite to customers. He dismissively said he was sorry for our ordeal, but brushed it off and walked away unconcerned, and didn't try to make it right. I'd highly advise avoiding the Tysons location of the Cheesecake Factory, and diners should instead consider Maggiano's Italian restaurant next door that is run very professionally with outstanding servers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=20,2.64,2.56,2.784,2.084,2.592

The first thing I told Carla was that my 7-year-old daughter has a dairy allergy. She confidently told us that the kids' spaghetti and meatball did not contain dairy. So that's what we ordered. After my daughter had almost finished her plate, she felt sick. I spoke with the manager and asked what ingredients the meatball contained. Parmesan cheese. My daughter felt sick for 6 hours until she finally vomited the pasta. Thanks Carla. You made my daughter sick. (I had already given her Benadryl once she said she was sick). At the beginning of our meal, we had asked for the bread that does not contain dairy. Carla's facial expression showed us that our request was more of a bother. When she came back with sourdough bread, she said ""this bread contains the least amount of dairy."" Least amount? Really? A food allergy is a food allergy, whether a person is exposed to a little or a lot. This just showed us what little knowledge this employee had of food allergies. Thank goodness my daughter did not go into anaphylaxis. Cheesecake Factory needs to step up the training of their employees and teach them the seriousness of food allergies. Someone could die. No joke. Just to add, this was not our first time eating at Cheesecake Factory. My daughter had no problems before.

We walked in and the floors were a bit slippery and The temperature seemed to be a bit low. We got seated fairly quickly. We sat in a nice small booth, which felt cozy and romantic.  As an appetizer we got the edamame-delicious. We asked our waiter for only one basket of the wheat bread and we got that quickly. We normally order salads from the skinnylicious menu. This visit was no different, I got the factory chopper salad and he got the Mexican tortilla salad. Everything tasted great. However, I was not blown away by the service. It was a late night and our food took a long time to come out. The appetizer and main meal came out minutes a part. When we finally got our food, we didn't see our waiter for a long time. I ran out of water, which is a problem because I added Tabasco hot sauce to my salad. Service can improve and same with the slippery floors. Later, I noticed a family taking turns taking pictures and their was a group of wait staff just laughing and not paying attention to their clients, so I got up and took the family photo for the family.

So, me being me, asked our lovely waitress if they could 're-direct' the air that was hitting us because it was super cold or have the thermostat adjusted?

I chose the Cheesecake Factory for lunch  because In the past I frequented the one in Boca Raton,Fl many times and loved it. What's not to like about the Cheesecake Factory?  It's not your typical chain.  From the minute I walked in, I saw a warm and cheery dining room and adjacent bar with high hats which is a great place to sit when the restaurant is packed.  You can just walk in and if open just sit instead of waiting for a table.  The staff is extremely professional and well trained. I knew it was mid afternoon so I was able to get seated right away.  My server was Jerry and he was very attentive, friendly and knowledgeable of the menu items. I started with their Tropical Ice Tea ( passion fruit) it's so delicious I didn't even need to add sugar.  If you ever come to the Cheesecake Factory , the menu is overwhelming. There are so many choices to choose from.  They have lunch specials, and one of my favorites is The Renee- One half of a Fresh Turkey Sandwich or Chicken-Almond Salad Sandwich, a Cup of Soup and a Small Green Salad or you can get a Small Caesar Salad for a $1.00 extra. This time I decided to order their Fish Tacos. 4 Soft Corn Tortillas Filled with   Grilled Fish, Avocado, Tomato, Chipotle Sauce, Marinated Onions and Cilantro. Served with Rice and Beans. My fish was tender, there was definitely a nice little bite of heat which gave great flavor to my dish along with the marinated onions and fresh cilantro. My avocado was soft and creamy so I didn't need sour cream .The portion size was great and it came with a side of rice and black beans which I combined.  My aunt had an omelette she was able to choose 4 fillings. Hers was Spinach, onions, mushrooms and goat cheese . They didn't have feta. It came with breakfast paprika  potatoes, and whole wheat toast. My aunt was very happy her omelette was cooked perfectly. I normally get their Apple Pie Cheesecake, which I'm not sure if it's seasonal. I also get the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle  Cheesecake. This  time I was too full to order dessert.. I gave them 5 stars because the food is consistently good. The service was really good and professional  The restaurant itself is spotless  They have an extensive menu , gluten free items and vegetarian items.along with low carb Cheesecake. I know that doesn't seem right.  They make their own flavored ice teas and lemonades. And of course all those amazing varieties of cheesecakes....

266,Emily M.,"McLean, VA",65,85,105.0,4.0,2017-10-24,"This is one of my favorite chain restaurants but service here is pretty hit or miss. I think the menu is far too large, and therefore all items aren't outstanding. However, if you stick to the specialities you should have a nice meal. My favorite entrees are the crispy chicken costoletta and chicken Madeira. The avocado egg rolls appetizer is also incredible. The few times that I have ordered something different I have regretted it, unfortunately.  On our last visit, our server was incredible and we were well taken care of. Andrew had noticed that one person was low carb and started making recommendations on how to make the best substitutions for his diet. It's a small thing but it means a lot! The cheesecake is usually the star of the meal and the reason we eat here. You can't go wrong with dulce de leche cheesecake, it's simply amazing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean,3.24,2.73,2.736,,2.934
264,Sharnitta R.,"Fort Washington, MD",144,96,98.0,3.0,2017-11-02,"I have frequent this Cheesecake Factory on many occasions and haven't ran into bad customer service as of yet . I arrived with a party of 3 on 10-25-17.  The elevators that take you directly inside the cheesecake were down so we had to walk through the mall just to get inside which was a disappointment. Anyways when we made our way to the hostess desk we were greeted right away and was seated in a short time. The waiter came within 10 min and she was super nice and showed plenty of enthusiasm. My only issue with this place is that they can never get it right with the temperature. Inside is always super cold and that should be monitored better when it's already super cold outside making it quite difficult to enjoy your meal. We started  with appetizers that consisted of fried calamari and buffalo chicken strips with the buffalo sauce on the side. The appetizers came out hot and pretty quick. There was no complaints on these items. Both were very good. Next the main meals, we ordered the kids cheese pizza, shrimp jambalaya and the chicken madeira. All of these was super good as well. Overall our experience was great and would recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean,3.28,2.73,2.728,,2.95

I called the restaurant and spoke with the Manager Ana, who said she can't refund me if I didn't have the receipt number. The cashier did not give me a receipt, so I asked her to look up the transition by time stamp/name/or amount. She said she will try and see what she can do and offered a new slice of cheesecake. At this point, I was so disgusted...pulling a long strand of hair out of my mouth just made my stomach turn.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean,3.32,2.72,2.72,,2.9600000000000004

262,Justin C.,"Washington, DC",60,271,,2.0,2017-12-18,"Had reservation for party of 12 at 630.  Arrived at 610 and they told us they wouldn't be able to seat us until 730. 730 rolls around, we don't get seated until like 8pm.  We didn't receive menus until like 815pm. Didn't order until like 845pm. Food comes out relatively quickly around 910pm but it's obvious the food is cold. My Louisiana Chicken Pasta tasted weird and the sauce was already starting to congeal so it had that saran wrap look to the sauce around the plate. We didn't even get dessert and ended up leaving around 10:15am so essentially I spent 4 hours at Cheesecake for a subpar meal.  I usually have a fantastic experience at Cheesecake but I will not be going back to this location.  I will say that the waiter really tried his best and was very kind so hats off to him, as I'm sure most, if not all, of the issues were unrelated to him.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean,3.12,2.72,2.7,,2.8800000000000003

Even during the busy Christmas season we were able to be seated immediately. My friend and I were greeted by the kindest waitress, Carla L.  She took no time in getting our drinks to us and our food was ready within 10 minutes of ordering.  When I tell you my Salmon was to die for, it was, to be crude, a foodgasm.  I have no complaint about anything other than the faint lighting in the restaurant.  Otherwise my drink was delicious, food was superb, and I'd even go so far as to give great reviews to my coworkers and friends!

5,Robert S.,"Washington, DC",2,8,,1.0,2017-12-28,"My wife and I have eaten at the Cheesecake Factory several times, mostly at the Mclean location and usually with positive results. On Christmas Eve Day we decided to have brunch and arrived as they opened. My menu choice this time was chicken marsala and to say it was terrible is an insult to all things terrible. It had absolutely no taste or even a hint of flavor or seasoning. Usually when ordering this dish the standard way it is served is with a generous portion of sauce to go along with the chicken and pasta. Mine was dryer than the Sahara and I had to ask our server for some (not additional) sauce for my meal. It took about 10-15 minutes to arrive at our table as they had to prepare it from scratch. It really made no difference at all to the quality of my meal nor did it satisfy me at all. I made a comment to my wife that it was like I tried to make chicken marsala which would be amazing as I cannot cook nor do I even attempt but my wife is a very accomplished cook and baker. To make matters worse our server never returned our debit card we gave her to pay. My wife noticed two days later and had to drive 20 minutes each way to retrieve it. What is normally a very enjoyable experience at TCF on this day was a complete disappointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=40,3.2,2.77,2.688,,2.942

No.  But the service was good and the food was decent.  Between us, we ordered the ahi tuna salad and the burger.  We weren't too hungry because we had eaten lunch fairly close to the time we visited this restaurant, but it was a great snack to tide us over until dinner.  This Cheesecake Factory is located within the Tysons II mall, which is the more upscale of the two malls. We didn't need a reservation when we visited at around 4/5pm on a Saturday afternoon, but they were still quite busy.  I would definitely visit again, though Tysons Corner is a bit far from where we live and I don't have too many occasions to visit the Tysons II mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean,3.24,2.79,2.692,,2.9700000000000006

261,Kendra B.,"McLean, VA",176,70,211.0,2.0,2018-01-13,"I now see why this place has 3-star reviews. Let's jump right into it......yesterday after a long day and rainy weather, I decided to order take out. I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya pasta and asked them to add andouille sausage. (Side note: it looked NOTHING like the pic from the business owner). They usually give a ton of pasta and it continues to swell in the to-go packaging so also asked for extra sauce. 20 minutes and I go in for pick up. I check my bag, all appeared to be there except for my extra sauce. The attendant runs to grab some and comes back with a half a cup of sauce. Really? Oookay, whatever. I'm tired and hungry and don't even want to ask why. Off I go to enjoy my take out.  I get home and find that my pasta is dry! I don't know if they interpreted my extra sauce to mean sauce on the side, but it was completely dry! There four shrimp TOTAL. Yes, I picked them out and counted. This is a $20 dish and they charged me $4 to add andouille sausage. So I called and asked for a manager. I told him what happened and he offered to ""knock a few bucks off"" to which I said WHAT?? I just spent $25 on a meal all to get home and discover it was dry but you wanna knock a few bucks off?!?!  Thank God I reminded the attendant about the extra sauce because what little they gave was all I had!!! But I digress. Back to this manager...so he tells me if I want to come back (in the rain) to grab some more sauce, he'd ""take care of me"" again to which I replied, what the hell?!?! The whole purpose of me ordering take out is because I didn't want to cook AND because it was nasty out. But you are offering to accommodate me with more sauce and a couple of bucks?? At this point I'm furious and these baby shrimp were staring back at me pissing me off even further. So I finally tell him, you do what you need to do and I'll call my bank to dispute the ENTIRE charge AND post pics of these infant shrimp with a detailed review. The moment I said review, his tune changed. He offered a full refund and apologized after insisting that he could do no more than ""a couple bucks"" because he wants me to come back. NOT because he wants to ensure satisfaction but because you want me to come buy more baby shrimp over dry pasta. Honey please!! Whatevs! I've gone to the location in Chevy Chase and the service is great and I never had issues with take out. I don't plan on visiting this location again anytime soon. It's not the first time I've experienced issues but they were minor so I didn't bother. But this took the cake for me. No pun intended. Save your money or go someplace else.  See infant shrimp in pics.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean,3.2,2.78,2.68,,2.9480000000000004
