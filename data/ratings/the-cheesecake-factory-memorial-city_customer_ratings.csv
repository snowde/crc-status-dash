273,Richard W.,"Austin, TX",0,38,,2.0,2012-01-30,"I have been to several Cheesecake locations, woodlands, galleria, memorial, etc. This location does not seem to rate as well IMO. The wait time is long, the service is subpar, and I have not been impressed with their food here. I have given this place 3 chances, and I think the 3rd was my last attempt.

The Cheesecake Factory does cheesecake well!  Most of the food that I have had there was fair as well. I have NEVER had good service at The Cheesecake Factory!

309,Elizabeth M.,"Houston, TX",1,52,,1.0,2012-04-15,"First things first.  We sat at the bar (our choice, there was plenty of seating elsewhere).  We ordered crab cakes, which were absolutely some of the best I've ever had.  My drink was pretty good (I had a couple of Mojitos and my husband had some beer). The service was the absolute worst I've had in a long, long, time.  It wasn't that the bartenders were unfriendly - they weren't - they seemed like nice kids, just clueless. After our initial order for the appetizer and drinks, they forgot we were there.  And this was with the restaurant and bar half empty.  We had to ask for water, we had to ask for silverware, we had to ask the bartender for another drink order.    Our third (and final) drink order I literally had to flag down our bartender with my napkin!  Like waving it over my head so he could see it.  The other bartender stopped him to tell him I was trying to flag him down (can u believe??!!)  I ordered a coffee and a beer for my husband.  When he eventually brought the beer, I asked him for the check and the unbelievable happened - he started to pay attention to us; I got the distinct impression he was very interested in getting a good tip because he really talked us up.  We got the check and proceeded to pay at the register on the way out (oh, he charged us for the coffee which we never got).  I did purchase a slice of their very delicious upside down cheesecake to-go at the dessert bar on the way out - final insult - it was about 1/4 of the size of the slices they serve at the restaurant - and $8.00 at that (sigh) - at this point I didn't even care anymore, I just wanted out of there.  I will NEVER go back to that location.  What a sad excuse for a customer-service establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memorial-city?start=300,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34
190,Crystal H.,"Houston, TX",54,296,204.0,4.0,2012-05-01,"Yes their menu is tacky, yes parking is a pain, and it's always busy here but those are just things that need to be taken with a grain of salt when going to  this popular chain restaurant.  I love their Lunch Specials. I always order the Pasta Da Vinci it's my absolute favorite pasta in this area. The pasta is always cooked Al Dente, the sauce is always creamy and full of flavor with a smooth finish and there's plenty of chicken and mushroom pieces with a slather or caramelized onions right on top. My friend had ordered the Goat Cheese & Pear Flatbread but instead ate half of my pasta! It's that good.  We went on a Sunday @ around 2:30pm so it's still pretty busy but we got sat right away. (The smaller your party the less of a wait). Our server was just okay. He had a small section but brought out our food on time and processed our checks timely. The only thing I would have to say is he didn't bring out any of that delicious pumpernickel bread until I had to ask for it. I like sopping up my Da Vinci sauce with it!  Overall I had a great experience and my expectations were met.

55,Alexander W.,"Houston, TX",999,708,5699.0,3.0,2012-05-14,"Okay...one question comes to mind about this place...what is up with all the flies in the building?!?  Thankfully, the flies stayed on the windows and on the glass that separates the kitchen area from the dining area, but that is still pretty bad.  I may have given this place 4 stars if I did not see so many frickin' flies! I went on Mother's Day, so you know that a considerable wait was going to happen.  No problem there.  The menu is quite extensive with a lot of variety, so no problem there at all.  Given that the establishment was so packed, I expected some mistakes to happen, and our server got about 90% of our order correct, so no problems there.  of course, the decor in the place is really nice, so no problems there. Food...portion sizes are plentiful, so no problems there.  Taste of the food...well...what is this?  Wait, a chain restaurant that actually uses seasoning, definitely not a problem there!  Very tasty dishes, and after you scour through many options, that can be overwhelming for fence straddlers, you can rest assured that the descriptions of the dishes are true to form.   I would have to mention that considering that they are known for cheesecake, I would like for this place to do one of two things.  Either they should make the slices of cheesecake bigger, or lower the cost of the cheesecake.  Better yet, they need to offer a sampler platter where you can get between 5 - 10 2"" squares of cheesecake so you can try a huge variety of them every time you visit the place. I could definitely go into the specifics of my dishes that I ordered, but that seems pointless.  Know these things: 1.  The decor of the place is nice. 2.  The staff is attentive and professional. 3.  There is a huge variety of options, EVEN WHEN ORDERING APPETIZERS!  What do I mean by that you may be thinking.  You have an appetizer section, then you have a subsection of appetizers, which is a mini-section of the appetizers...like a sampler's special or plate!  Check the on-line menu to see what I mean. 4.  The portion size of entrees is definitely plentiful.  The pricing of the food items are workable...not cheap food, but no where near expensive food. 5.  You will find a cheese cake that you like...PERIOD!  Great variety of flavors available.

Its already bad enough wearing white working in a restaurant and it gets really dirty,but as a customer I would prefer to not see how dirty you are. With all the lighting that is in that restaurant I could see it all,how dirty their clothes and shoes were. Customer service was okay,I wouldn't say the were the best,just ""okay."" Our drinks were empty for quite some time before the waiter realized that we needed more. I wouldn't go back to this location,I would prefer the Woodlands or Galleria one over this one.

266,Alicia E.,"Houston, TX",1,10,2.0,1.0,2012-05-30,"I took my mother to lunch a couple of months ago at the Cheesecake Factory at Memorial City Mall.  It was our first time at this location.  Our food tasted ok - nothing worth ordering again.  While we were waiting for the check, I began to feel sick to my stomach and had to run to the bathroom.  Long story short, after many trips to the toilet for both me and my mom, I called them to complain.  I spoke to a manager, Stephanie, and was told that their corporate office handled these issues.  So she took my name, number, receipt number, and told us someone would get back with us.  That never happened.  Later in the day, I called again and was given the number to their guest relations department in California.  The only issue is that they close at 4pm! Finally, one week later, my call was returned.  They apologized for the quality issue and told me that they were going to send me a gift card in the amount I spent (they do not give refunds).  Of course, I never received anything in the mail. If you do go to the Cheesecake Factory, I hope your experience is a good one.  Their lack of customer service and inability to handle issues locally will keep me from ever going there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memorial-city?start=280,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.372,2.88

252,Nadia V.,"Houston, TX",183,152,372.0,4.0,2012-09-03,"A word of caution - you are reading the review of a gal who would drive three hours (from the  East Carolina Coast to Raleigh) just for a slice of cheesecake (okay, and some shopping as well).  I've always been a fan of this place, especially when I could eat whatever I wanted and not have to worry about fitting into my clothes.  I was on a several year hiatus from this place just because I couldn't resist the temptation of their desserts. I mean, come on. It's cheesecake --- any way you like it! When this location opened up, I decided that I had to start revisiting because they are closer. I was SO happy to find that they have new options which include healthier selections. Their Skinny Menu is wonderful! The Asian Chicken Lettuce Wraps ($6) and Ahi Tuna Tartar are two of my faves.  Service is always spot-on. Even though the parking stinks, we never seem to have a long wait.  Now that I dine with kids, a Kid's Menu is more important than anything else. They have more than just mac & cheese on their menu. That makes me happy. Also, $1 ice cream with the option of chocolate, vanilla, or coffee flavored. Enough said. I knocked one star because I'm bitter that they no longer make my favorite cheesecake: Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. That makes me wanna cry just a little bit, even though there are TONS of other cheesecakes to choose from.  When you are looking for something - but not sure what - this is the place. With a menu the size of a phone book, you are bound to find something that will make your tummy happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memorial-city?start=240,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.8320000000000003,2.88
262,Benji D.,"Houston, TX",134,10,,2.0,2012-09-08,"I was warned prior to coming to this location about the atrocious service, but being the kind of person who would rather have an experience for myself I decided to come out and check out the Memorial Location .. and I was blown away by how accurate the warnings were. I am certain a horde of dead people would move with more purpose than the waiters. With so many waiters just standing around I am confused why our server seemed completely frazzled. We had to ask for pretty much everything you would expect as a restaurant: bread, plate, refills, all of it. Next, when we asked why there was such a delay in service as oppose to simply 'Let me get a manager', or something of the sort, she rambled excuse after excuse for the poor service. Now, for some of the good; the food was delicious. Everything everyone ordered was cooked right and tasted great, even if it took a good while for it all to come out. The cheesecake, of course, was perfect, even if it too took ages to come out. Our waitress just didn't seem really attentive.  Cheesecake Factory has always been good food, but when the food is side by side with abhorred service I would definitely not waste coming here again. If you are craving Cheesecake Factory then make the extra trip to the Galleria area, or if you don't mind having to tell your server how to do their job proper, and simply don't want to worry about leaving a tip, then I would say take the gamble with the Memorial location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memorial-city?start=280,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.6320000000000006,2.8

The cheesecake was really good, but not so impressed with the entrees; average.  We noticed quite a few flies which always takes a bit away from the appetite.  We also noticed that all the wait staff were dressed in all white, which is fine, however, many of them looked dirty (especially our waitress) & it was early afternoon so couldn't have been open for long.

229,Ashley B.,"Houston, TX",14,83,31.0,3.0,2013-06-13,"Recently I was shopping in Memorial Mall and decided I wanted some lunch.  The question was, what did I want?  I definitely didn't want food court, I wasn't in the mood for Panera Bread, or California Pizza Kitchen, and Beck's Prime was more then I wanted to spend.  So by process of elimination I ended up at Cheesecake Factory. Now that's not necessarily a bad thing to me because I've usually gotten pretty good food at Cheesecake Factory.  I've always thought it was overpriced, but not outrageously so, and I've always been content when I left the table. I was seated shortly after my arrival at a mini booth near the door and given the menu, which is actually a book.  I'm not kidding, it's a real book, and it is an extensive one at that.  I thought about getting the mini sliders, or even the chicken mini sliders from the appetizer menu (lamenting that there was no sampler plate all the while) but I finally noticed the Cuban in the sandwich section.  I love a good Cuban, and it was a simple task to tell the waiter to make sure they left the mayo off my sandwich.  Who puts mayo on a Cuban?  Seriously?    Happily they complied with my request and my sandwich came mayo free a short time later.  Portion quantity was just fine.  There were plenty of fries that were hot and fresh cut, and the sandwich was big enough for me to take half home and eat half at the table.  And it was a well made sandwich.  The bread was perfect, it came freshly made and the meat and cheese were all pressed together nicely.  My meal also include freshly made brown bread to nibble on while waiting for me entree to come out.  The service was very polite, prompt and attentive without being intrusive. So why am I only giving 3 stars?  I know this is going to sound a little ditzy but the roast pork wasn't processed enough.  They literally cut a slice of roast pork loin to put on this sandwich, and while that sounds really great, it also ended up containing a fair amount of fat in the meat.  If you've read my other reviews you know what a problem that is for me.  In this case it didn't ruin the meal for me but I do wish they would have culled some of the fat out of the meat before putting it on my sandwich.  The other reason I'm going with 3 stars is that Cheesecake Factory IS overpriced.  I went in knowing that and was prepared for it but it still rankled me when the bill comes.   I mean honestly paying over $15 for a sandwich and fries while drinking water is a bit much in my opinion.  God forbid I had added the strawberry lemonade they make (which is awesomely good but upsets my acid reflux), or a slice of cheesecake (which is also awesomely good no matter what flavor you get, but also awesomely bad for you and expensive too).  If I had done that I would have ended up spending $25 on lunch for one and I just can't justify that. In the end I really want to love The Cheesecake Factory, but I can only afford to like it as a casual acquaintance who occasionally wows me and occasionally disappoints me.  Love requires more consistency at these prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memorial-city?start=260,2.6,2.6,2.6,3.1160000000000005,2.6

I love many things about TCF; the atmosphere; especially the patio on a chill day!  The service has never failed me and the cheesecake damn sho never fails.  The food sometimes does, the salmon and shrimp scampi combo really failed me but that's later. As far as the apps, I've tried the avocado egg rolls and the fried cheese.  I wouldn't bother with either; over priced, not worth it and most importantly, not all that good. My go to dish is always the lemon herb roasted chicken: half a chicken + carrots + mashed potatoes.  All delicious but if you're not a lemony person, I wouldn't get this. I've tried the salads; the lunch portions are huge, you honestly can share them $5pp....cheap lunch.  They can be rather bland though :( womp womp the bbq chicken really wasn't on point; the cobb is decent but ask for extra dressing. I've had a few other OK dishes; shrimp platter, chicken maderia...legit no major complaints but then comes the salmon and shrimp scampi which was surprisingly bland for $20!

The Lambic Raspberry was excellent and several in my group got one after sampling mine. Even had La Fin Du Monde.  I ordered the Luisiana Chicken Pasta. 4.5 star, the pasta was cooked on point, firm but tender and the parmesan crusted chicken was light, tasty, and not greasy or oily. The sauce was excellent with nice tangy bite. Was looking for bread afterward to mop it up. Very large portion size.  The pasta dish was large enough to forgo the need for an appetizer. I split the key lime cheesecake with a friend. Excellent, painfully tart and very good. The whipped cream tasted fresh made.

It makes you feel like you're actually going to a nice place without having to drive downtown or across town. The service was decent. I would like to suggest that the waiter needs to confirm rules and menu before saying YES.  Strike #1- I ordered the Cajun Chicken and Shrimp jambalaya. I asked if it came with garlic bread. He said yes. Then he came back and told me no....he offered another type of bread but I wasn't interested. Strike #2- I told him it was my wife's bday and I asked if they do anything special like a song or dance for Bdays. He replied, I will see what we can which caused me to assume there will be some form of acknowledgement. Well NOTHING was mentioned after that.

To start, the wait was almost unimaginable.  The hostess told us 20-35 minutes and we ended up waiting 50 minutes for a table.  When we walked around there were several tables open.  Likewise, we told the hostess we wanted first available and then when I checked with the hostess she had us down for inside-only which was the primary cause for the long wait (her mistake).  When we were seated, we waited at least 5-7 minutes before a server came along.  He said he was not our sever but was going to help us in the meantime.  However, we were never served by someone else so I guess he was the only server for our table.  When the appetizers came 30 minutes after being ordered the server forgot the bread plates so our appetizers got cold.  We had to continually ask him for silverware, plates and sugar for tea.  After about 10 minutes of him not returning with sugar I said ""sir!"" and his response was ""I got you.""  I've never had a server speak so rudely infront of guests.  Once our needs were somewhat met, he never returned.   When the dinner arrived we were missing one entree for 10 minutes.  When it arrived the bread was completely soggy so my sister-in-law asked for new bread.  She waited another 15 minutes while they replaced the entire sandwich.... All she wanted was new bread.   The floor outside was greasy and disgusting.  Likewise, the bathrooms were absolutely terrible.  My sister-in-law didn't even let her daughter walk in the bathroom and when she had to go again later in the evening she asked her daughter if she could wait so they didn't have to go into the digusting bathrooms again.  On her way back, she almost slipped in the walkway due to the wet floors.  Mind you, she is pregnant and was holding her 3 year old daughter. Overall, this was the worst restaurant visit I have had in Houston, ever.  If it wasn't for it being my wife's birthday as well as having a hungry child we would have immediately walked out.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone until management fixes the tremendous amounts of problems.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memorial-city?start=280,3.44,3.44,3.44,2.372,3.4400000000000004

We sat at the bar.  It took a long time for someone to come over. There were so many waitstaff wandering around, looking busy but really they appeared to be just walking to or from someplace, not really DOING anything.   Our waiter was okay, the food was good and fresh. My brother got a hamburger that he said it was the best one he has ever had.  He then had a snickers cheesecake which was downright sinful. Our waiter left and another waiter took over. He was okay, he forgot a few things and the wait time was long for an extra plate, and he didn't hand it to us, he just  said, I brought you an extra plate.  And stood there.  Then came the bathrooms.  They were filthy. My sister came back from an attempt and refused to use the facilities.  She said there was urine all over every seat.  I had to take a look for myself. I went in and there sure enough were droplets of something on the seats.  There was toilet paper on the floor of one stall and both rolls of TP were empty.  This was about 4 PM - how this went unchecked all afternoon is beyond me.  I decided to take a picture and yelp this, but right then, the toiled burbled and shot up about 8"" like Old Faithful.  I stood there looking, and it happened again. That's what I think the water droplets were on the toilet seats...toilet water. This place needs a plumber to look at their system.  It appears their ventilation or something is way, way off.   There was food on the floor as we were leaving. We saw it before we stood up and the waitstaff didn't see it (or didn't want to) and they were walking thru it.  We pointed it out and our waiter wiped it up.  It looked pretty greasy, whatever it was and I was concerned for someone whose footing may not be sure.   Anyway, the food was pretty good, fresh, yummy and as ordered.  It was the cleanliness of the bathrooms that was such a turn off and the waitstaff didn't seem to give a darn about much.

232,Mady N.,"Missouri City, TX",0,10,,1.0,2014-06-08,"WORST SERVICE EVER !!! Attempted to celebrate my mom and brothers' birthday this Saturday at Cheesecake, but it turned into a birthday to try to forget. First off, we waited over 2 1/2 hours to be seated. Next, our waiter comes and his sole purpose is to first see how we are paying on the ticket...No bread, no drinks. Finally he takes drink orders, returns and asks about appetizers. He only takes an appetizer order from two people at the table and then leaves to ring it up. The rest of us are sitting there just waiting. My husband waves at him to return so that others can order appetizers too. At this point, we are all wondering what is wrong here. So he takes appetizer orders, and we don't see him again for some time until he comes back with another young waitress. She looks confused and new and she says she is going to help with dinner orders. Mind you, we are still waiting on BREAD after an over two hour wait to be seated. But everybody is still calm. The young lady begins taking orders, but the male waiter never returns. We see him helping other tables! Finally he comes back to our table with bread, this is probably 30 mins into us sitting down, and we never see him again. The new waitress is left to wait on us, and she was clearly overwhelmed with a 10 top table. She takes our orders, but during our long wait, no one refills our drinks, asks if we need anything or comes to our table. We had to stop a bus boy to ask for water and finally when the waitress did return, she refilled one side of the table's drinks and not the other! I just could not believe the service we were receiving, seeing that I am a frequent Cheesecake visitor (sugarland/galleria locations) and I have always received great service at those two locations. So finally the food comes out, and they are missing my plate and my brother's father in law's plate. No condiments for the people who had food and still no drink refills. At this point,we are just over it. My whole family finishes their food and our food never comes out!!! The waitress tells us a manager will be over, but one never comes. My family is literally packed up and ready to leave before a manager approaches.  She has a dry apology and asks us if we want free dessert or soup. My husband was like, No, they would like their food orders. She didn't even offer our meals free at first until my husband spoke up for us. She said they stopped the order, but magically she came back with our food packed up and ready to go in less than 10 mins. So either the food was just back their sitting or they just gave us someone else's food. Who knew at this point. I was just ready to leave. We had been there since 2:30 and it was now 7pm!!! To add insult to injury, it took the waitress another 30 mins to ring us out and they messed up some of the payments. What a birthday to remember. This was the worst dining experience I have ever been through and the worst part was when they sung happy birthday to my mom and brother, they did it with only 2 wait staff. Really? It was pitiful and I felt so bad for my brother because he picked this location. I could tell he was hurt and embarrassed and it was his birthday to enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memorial-city?start=260,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.6920000000000006,2.96

I rushed from my side of town to get to the restaurant exactly at eight because I know how it feels to wait for dinner guests when you're hungry.  However, we did not get a table until 9.  Why such the delay???? Because CF does not take reservations!  I was highly surprised by this since Grand Lux Cafe in the Galleria takes reservations and they are a sister company of The Cheesecake Factory. From what my friend told me, she knew about there being no reservations, but she arrived early to request a table and she was told that getting a table inside the restaurant  would demand at least a TWO HOUR WAIT! Must be a joke--not even feasible. Instead they told her they could get a table for her on the patio--it just needed to be cleaned up. I guess the cleaning supplies was stolen by the Tooth Fairy because we still were not seated until 9. and guess where we ended up being seated? Inside. By the bar. They finally used their heads and pushed some bar tables together to accommodate our group. Only problem with bar tables are the high as a kite bar seats. I felt like a pregnant woman in her final trimester trying sit in the chair and scoot it up close enough to sit at the table comfortably. It was a struggle!!!  At this point, I was pretty much over the desire to dine at CF. I had perused the menu before I came to save time, but nothing really enticed my taste buds. After the wait, all I needed was a glass of water and complimentary bread and butter to make it to my next destination.  Seriously, CF needs to consider some sort of reservation system. We came on a Friday night, which is going to be busy. However, their sister company Grand Lux, has a steady flow of patrons and allows them to reserve seating--giving them 15 minutes grace before releasing the table. They're not losing business with a reservation system. CF could use the same protocol to give patrons a chance to dine at their establishment as well. Until then, I believe I'll pass on dining at Cheesecake Factory for awhile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memorial-city?start=140,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.8200000000000003,2.84

We arrived at the mall and, of course, could't find a parking spot after driving around for 15 minutes. So, we ended up paying $10 for valet... that's right, $10.  After finally making it into the restaurant, we should have just left at that point... it was sweltering hot in there, which we found out later was due to the fact that the restaurant's main A/C unit was broken. But, we were looking forward to some CF food all week, so we stuck it out. The hostess told us the wait would be about 20-30 minutes. It was over an hour... waiting in the sweltering heat.  As we were waiting to be seated, I couldn't help but look around... and I was not real keen on the crowd that was in the restaurant. There were people there in wife-beaters and flip flops... just seemed trashy.  I will say that the wait staff was excellent... the bartender that waited on us for the hour before we were finally seated was pleasant and the waiter we had was very attentive and nice.  The food was ok, and really just not as good as I've had at other locations. For the main course, I had the chicken chipotle pasta. It was pretty tasty, but lacking in a few areas... the asparagus, for instance, was clearly undercooked. I had to eat around it and then found myself wishing that they had made it correctly becuase the dish lacked without it.  We were so uncomfortable, we ended the dinner abruptly and skipped out on the cheesecake... I doubt we will ever return to this location.  BOTTOM LINE: Not the best Cheesecake Factory...

Parking at The Cheesecake Factory is just like driving in Houston traffic anytime of the day: a hot mess. I came during the lunch hour. I had to park so far away from the restaurant that I actually worked off the lunch calories before I made it back to my car (or so it seemed.) I ordered the Renee Special which is the chicken salad sandwich, soup and a house salad. I ordered water  to drink. The clam chowder was creamy and delicious. It had an ample amount of clams, diced potatoes and onions in a rich, creamy broth. The chicken salad comes sliced in wedges of grilled, buttered toast, with some sort of sour, blue cheese type dressing. The chicken salad had a strange, almost sour flavor that overpowered my taste buds. It just didn't taste good. The house salad was well, just a salad. The greens and tomatoes were incredibly fresh, however. I didn't care for the bread that comes out first. The bread is served in an unlined, wire rack. When the bread comes, it's just the bread, the rack, and the table surface. LOL. The first batch of bread served was cold as ice. The bread was not that flavorful and too chewy. The  second batch of bread was warm but still not tasty enough of me to give it a great rating. We had a great waitress. It took a while for the food to be served, maybe 20 minutes. Overall, The Cheesecake Factory is overpriced for the quality of food that it serves. It was my first time coming there, and I was not impressed.

I was told they do have reservations during the week, so I may be back again soon, when it's not as busy. Another tip - be sure to listen CLOSELY if your name is called for a table (they were out of pagers when I arrived). I almost missed my table because I couldn't hear what the hostess was saying through all the clatter of plates and people talking around me. The hostess should definitely use a microphone to tackle this problem.

If I were one of those people who could eat whatever they wanted and never gain weight, I would eat at The Cheesecake Factory at least once a week. Their food is loaded with fat, cheese, and sugar and it's DELICIOUS! Alas, I am not one of those aforementioned naturally skinny people, so the Skinny Menu allows me to feel somewhat better about myself before I devour a massive, gluttonous, whipped cream covered piece of cheesecake.  Seriously though, the Skinny Menu has lots of delicious options and seems like a good balance when you know you're going to indulge in dessert.  Or every once in a while, just give in and have a decadent entree AND dessert (you can for sure have leftovers of both - portions are HUGE).  The complimentary brown bread is also worth the calories (skip the white bread).  And for the massive portions, I feel as though the prices are right. And the staff are always so nice.

It was definitely not family friendly or 5 and under children due to limited waiting area. we went on Xmas week and it was Cold and people had children waiting for a table with small children by the front door. Sad to see this kids freezing for a table with parents. Again not knocking the restaurant but if you know not just adults are coming to diner get a better place for kids too if that is where the franchise is heading to family.  It was very sophisticated location on the Memorial Mall, but not family friendly. If on a date, or meeting other adults it is a great place!!!! The location seem to be to congested for my taste but that's just my little too cents.  The Staff, AWESOME!  We were helped with the menu since this was my first experience with the restaurant. The waiter was knowledgeable of the menu and when I asked for a recommendation he did a great job.   The meal was exquisite, and the price was ..well lets just say you get what you pay for and we got a lot lol.

Then, they offered to take my plate to keep it warm and serve with my wife's dinner.  They ended up remaking both of our dinners and again served them piping hot and perfectly prepared.   While we waited (briefly) for our remade dinner, the server Peter, his assistant Yousef and the manager all came by to apologize again.   Dessert was complimentary.  We chose the turtle caramel cheesecake.

After checking my CC statement, I realized that my server went ahead and inserted a larger tip than what I initially left him.

Here is why: Perk #1: You have a group of friends debating what to eat. Well debate no more, their menu caters to everyone's taste. They have an extensive menu filled with good tasting food. Nothing magnificent but by no means bad. Perk #2: People say you ""can't have your cake and eat it too"". At this place you can, because you will find yourself wanting to order more than one cheesecake. So eat your cheesecake because you will probably end up ordering seconds to take home. My favorites so far are their red velvet cake, Chris' outrageous, and snickers cheesecake. OMG! you will not be disappointed I guarantee it with a 5 year warranty.  Perk #3: Their bread and butter! I love their brown bread! If it is your first time here be careful or you might end up filling up just eating it. That good? YES! Perk #4: good place for couples as it has a romantic feel to the place. But how romantic on a scale of 1-5? Solid 3.  Perk #5: Memorial City Mall is right next door to walk the food off.

79,Taylor W.,"Houston, TX",11,16,42.0,2.0,2015-07-29,"I heard half priced cheesecake and I got excited, BUT the trip out to Memorial City definitely wasn't worth saving $4 on cheesecake.  When we arrived the place was packed, which is too be expected at 7:30 dinner time. We waited 30 minutes for a table for 2 and when our table ready buzzer went off, we waited an additional 10 minutes for the hostesses to seat other tables and finally get to our ticket. The waitress was pretty nice. She mentioned her name but not loud or clear enough for me to remember. Her service was fair. Check on our table as much as needed. She only forgot one item and that's when I requested additional bread for the table. I had to remind her, but it quickly arrived shortly after. We sat next to the bar area at a small table along the mirrored back seating. One of my biggest pet peeves at restaurant is having the tables too close together! I could hear the entire conversation being held at the table next to us and I could have enjoyed my dinner a little bit more if I didn't have to listen to who the young lady was dating and why.  The food was very mediocre. I've had the Buffalo Blast a few times at the Galleria location and had my heart set on getting those, but of course after I order the waitress comes back with disheartening news that they were out. I settled for the chicken parmesan sandwich and I would have been happier with a spicy chicken sandwich form Chickfila. It was unseasoned and came with almost nothing on it. I was so disappointed. The only thing I enjoyed was the wheat table bread.  I ordered my half priced cheesecake togo and learned a valuable lesson, every deal isn't always worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memorial-city?start=120,3.12,3.1,3.1,2.3760000000000003,3.1080000000000005
224,Melinda S.,"Austin, TX",1,26,5.0,3.0,2015-07-30,"Went last night after we checked into The Westin.  Party of 3..my husband,  my daughter, and myself.  There was a large crowd waiting so I assumed the wait would be long.  Walking up to hostess stand I was NOT greeted by a sour puss faced hostess. After standing there waiting for this pissy nongreeting hostess to acknowledge my presence,       She barely looked up and asked how many in my party.  I tell her 3 and she asks for a name. I very politely ask her how long the wait is...she very rudely says 30 min.  As I am standing there I witness her speak to another customer in a completely rude manner.  I'm shocked that this is the individual The Cheesecake Factory puts in front of house to be the ""greeter"" of their customers.   We ended up waiting about 20 min before our buzzer went off.. I brought the pager back up to the stand only to be rudely told to move to the right to wait to be seated.   After 10 min we were finally seated outside. The rest of the evening went very smoothly.  Our server, Larry, was on the ball and the food was great.

Nothing wrong with a family oriented environment except a screaming 10-month old baby and a 2 year old in the bar area.  The foot traffic was super slow when we arrived. Our server was Bianca and I was utterly disappointed. The service was so bad, other servers had to help us from drinks and food not arriving, to asking her to remove dishes from the table since it was so cluttered and the table was small. It took almost 30 minutes to get the bill and then my friend and I decided to split the bill. The server only came back with one credit card - mine! She put the entire total on my bill and ""lost"" my friend's credit card.  A manager, Mike, came over and apologized. He offered us a piece of cheesecake as we were on the floor looking for the credit card. We were all over the bar area looking for my friend's credit card and the manager tried to convince us to stay and have cheesecake/more food.  Finally, 20 minutes later, my friend's credit card suddenly appeared out of nowhere and the server said she ""dropped"" the card somewhere. The manager then ""corrected"" the bill and this morning, I woke up with four random authorizations from their establishment on my credit card with different amounts not matching up to my receipt.  Hopefully the authorizations go away in the next day or two or I will have to cancel my credit card.  My friend was freaked out because her credit card was missing and wondered what happened to it the 20 mins it disappeared?

31,Stephanie C.,"Boston, MA",206,206,526.0,3.0,2015-08-28,"Went here for dinner with my mom, since we had a gift card. To be honest, the only thing I really like about CF is the cheesecake, but their massive entree menu always gives me reason to believe that I'll find a diamond in the rough.  This time, I put my bet on the fish tacos, which I ordered fried. I envisioned a light, crunchy, and flavorful snack, but I should have known better. My enormous platter came loaded with four fish tacos, each tucked to the brim with a large and greasy battered fish nugget on a bed of mayo-saturated veggies. The taco shells consisted of two soft corn shells each, which I understand for the purpose structural integrity. However, all of this amounted to an overwhelming amount of subpar food for me. The tacos really could have used some crunchier veggies and maybe a tangy dipping sauce like salsa to brighten them up. Also, there was guac in the tacos, but so little that they might as well have left it out. The dish came with unexciting sides of black beans and dry, hard herbed rice. My mom ordered the Chicken Madeira, which really fared no better. We could only each finish half of our meal, and even at that point were close to exploding.  The cheesecake was the saving grace of the meal, as expected. I got an Oreo extreme dream cheesecake, and yes, it was as dense and uber rich as it sounds, but it was well worth it. Awesome choice if you love chocolate! And I'm not afraid to admit that my favorite part is always the whipped cream.  The service was aight. The waiters were busy as usual, but tended to us in good time and were polite.  If you're looking to have dinner here, I suggest the glam burgers or something off the skinnylicious menu, as otherwise the food is not really worth the calories. Otherwise, just forgo the entree and cut straight to the real reason this place exists: the glorious cheesecake.

72,Donna L.,"Houston, TX",1,17,2.0,2.0,2015-09-23,"I need to start off by saying that CF has always been my solid go-to restaurant. Hungry but not sure what I want? CF's huge menu would satisfy any craving from super sweet to savory. In general, all their franchises serve pretty good food - not great but pretty consistent.  Here was the problem with tonight's visit. Went with a friend, had grilled artichokes, avocado salad, miso salmon, decaf coffee and 30th anniversary chocolate cheesecake.  All the food was OK. We were not offered bread but then again, I could have just asked for it. Then came the bill.... I couldn't help but notice a glaring tipping guide highlighted in bright orange. For me, this was very odd. Out of everything, my server felt the need to highlight the tipping guide. I don't know why she felt the need to do this so I kindly asked for a manager. I asked the manager if it was customary for waiters to highlight the bills. She said yes. I asked which particular parts are typically highlighted. She said the tipping guide! Then she went on to explain to me that since Obama got rid of the mandatory service charges of parties over 6, they started to highlight the tipping guide. I didn't quite understand the reasoning or explanation but verified that all the servers typically highlight it for everyone regardless of party size. There is no way to see if she's telling the truth but I'd like to know if other yelpers have seen this before. Perhaps I'm just making a big deal over nothing? Here's what really gets me. My server highlighted the tipping guide on all 3 copies of my bill. It didn't sit well with me and left a very bad taste in my mouth. There are not many times where I feel openly discriminated, but in this case, I felt like I was given a tipping lesson and for what reason? I thanked the manager for verifying that this is the restaurant's normal practice. The waiter came back and very abruptly said ""I'm sorry if I offended you"". I said ""no, you shouldn't be sorry. Your manager just confirmed that your restaurant does this with all the tables. I just don't really understand why"". She said that it saves the customer time from having to pull out their phone and calculate the tip. I told her even if she didn't highlight it, it is very obvious on the bill.  All in all, if everyone is treated like this, I think CF should rethink their policies. It's just not professional and really lacks class. I know it's not a 5 star restaurant but does it need to be this way?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memorial-city?start=120,3.16,3.14,3.14,1.9280000000000002,3.1480000000000006

150,Grace K.,"Knoxville, TN",263,255,1092.0,3.0,2016-02-09,"I've dined at Cheesecake Factory numerous times. There are no reservations available, for it is walk in only.  Huge restaurant with multiple chains around. There is a full bar present located within, different at each location. Despite the number of people, it doesn't feel like you're sitting in a room with strangers. You have your privacy due to the spacing. Servers first come to ask for your drinks and bring a batch of complimentary white and brown bread. I always ask for brown only because I prefer it than the white, trust me. The brown bread slightly has a sweet taste to it. You can ask for refills.  FOOD: Menu is broad and fantastic. There is something for everyone. On a diet? Try the skinnylicious menu. Small plates? Appetizer? Pasta? Burgers? Steak? Vegetarian? Literally great menu and variety.  Skinnylicious Salmon Rolls (4/5): Is this really part of the Skinnylicious menu? The 4 rolls were oily but tasted delicious.  Fried Macaroni and Cheese (4/5): My family goes nuts about this. I'm not a big fan as they are, but we order this every time. There are 4 pieces filled with a bunch of macaroni in cheese balls. Marinara sauce is included. Think of mac + cheese sticks if you need an idea of what it would taste like. Southwest Chicken Sandwich (3/5): I wasn't a big fan of this. Flavors were there but I wouldn't order this again. This reminded me of the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta due to the flavor. Bread was just a little too hard for me. Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp (4/5): This was the first plate I ever tried at a Cheesecake Factory. Definitely a recommendation if you're not sure what to eat. I even tried to make a replica of it at home, Google does wonders. This is a Thai-based entree which is not spicy at all. Great flavor though especially with the peanut sauce! Chicken Piccata (4/5): I love pasta with lemon, and I always seem to order this lunch portioned dish. The reason why I knock off a star is the oil. Too much oil. Pasta may seem bland, but I think the amount of flavor is ideal. Everything balances out when you eat it all together. Also, it is light on the stomach for the most part.  Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta (5/5): Literally, best thing ever. My family always orders this when I'm here. If you have not tried it, order it. I would recommend the dinner portion for your lunch the next day. It isn't spicy what so ever, and the flavor is damn good. This is a penne pasta with chicken breast strips with cream based sauce.  A star is deducted due to the service. Service is always unpredictable here depending on when you come and if the server is new. My biggest thing is when my water is already rock bottom, and I have to remind the waiter two times before it is refilled. Fill my drinks and you'll make me (and everyone) happy.  Overall, great restaurant to dine at whether it be business, family, or friends.

He gave us great service even though they were having many problems in the kitchen, from our appetizers not having any sauces on them, to us not having any silverware for a good portion of the dinner, drinks taking 45+ mins, chicken over cooked on both our meals, to now me being denied a piece of cheesecake.

Im not sure what our servers name was while ordering/eating, she didn't introduce herself. Staff is very busy so they aren't as attentive, so you're trying to get their attention more than they try to pay yours.  We ordered the buffalo blast and two cheesecake, mango and white chocolate w/ caramel. Our accompanying friends ordered a buffalo blast as well along with a steak and fried macaroni app. Our food came out first (even the cheese cake). Buffalo blast was yummy, this is an app BUT they're so big it can be an entree for two. Spicy and yummy (chicken mixed with buffalo sauce with a fried wrap around it served with buffalo sauce and blue cheese). Fried Mac was never brought out, and once our friends medium well steak came it was the beginning to an end. Steak was BLOODY red, very rare, we made our server aware and she got a new one but my friend got it to go due to loss of appetite (that happens when you wait so long for food and when you get it it's not what you expect). So he also ordered two cheesecakes to go. Everything was brought out BUT the steak and the server almost let us go home without it had we not double checked.  I could see following tables were having trouble reaching their servers as well, maybe introducing themselves to their guest would be easier rather than guest having to wait on their servers.

The floors were sticky, the tables weren't in good condition, and when we got ready to leave a baby roach started crawling up the booth where my friends were sitting. The women's bathrooms were deplorable with used feminine hygiene products out in the open and blood in the toilets unflushed. Clearly no one was tending to the restrooms.  Our waitress was fun but her mouth was too big. She looked at my friend who is of middle eastern decent and asked him if he was okay with the pork in the dish we ordered. I think she thought she was being helpful but that was a unwarranted and presumptuously racist comment. He had not specified that he had any dietary restrictions.  There was lots of confusion with our order apparently as several people came by asking what we had ordered. This was quite ridiculous because we only ordered two or three things.

Today, my pregnant self, husband and along 3 kids and my sister waited literally over 30 mins to be seated. Fine, I get it. It happens sometime. But honestly today was one of my worst experience due to the hostess KATHERINE. Not only was she rude,super unfriendly and not once have I seen her smile at all to anyone that walked thru the door. I wish I had took a picture of her how unhappy she looks! She had that face like ""I hate my job and I hate people kinda face on""  I requested to be seated outside since the patio is open. And her respond was very unprofessional... she says there wasn't any server outside but clearly there was two servers serving outside. I was disappointed because my family and I really wanted to sit outside and enjoy the day. She could have responded back in a friendly manners I would have understand. But what I don't understand is why is there people sitting outside if there is no server serving outside. At this point, I was hungry and tired of waiting and didn't want to make a big deal for not able to be seated outside. Looking back now I seriously wish I could had talk to a manager and point out about Katherine attitude and how unhappy and not so friendly customer services she is.

Already a little odd to me, but okay, I guess. Anyway, the whole party was there at 1, and we didn't get seating until about 1:45, but to be fair it was Sunday right around lunch time. When we were seated, we were given the outside seating, and had the tables pretty much set up as if many different parties were going to be using the area, not just our family, so we waited and stood around looking confused for a while until we decide to start moving tables together ourselves, when the person who turned out to be our waiter eventually came out to help. The waiter was overall nice, but nothing stellar as far as service, and getting any drink orders took forever, and the food took even longer. As far as taste, I enjoyed my plate as did most everyone else, but the wait for everything just took so long.

Not only is this smaller and more crowded, the service is disappointing and food is mediocre.  Is being seated almost immediately and then not meeting your server until ten minutes later fine with you? Is finally meeting your server and placing your orders for drinks and entrees, then receiving your tea and coffee another 15 minutes later also okay with you? Well if you answered yes to those questions then this would be your perfect lunch/dinner/date/happy hour option. My party of 5 had begun to wonder if our server had forgotten about us or if she was extremely busy or just inefficient. Whatever the case was, it was clearly unacceptable. Our coffees were brought out in a clear mug, no dish. It was lukewarm at best and had a soapy dishwater after taste, bleh. We had a difficult time flagging down our server to ask for a replacement. After waiting an hour, and 2 coffee refills later, our entrees were still nowhere to be found. We had to speak with management about the service and he was apologetic. Our entrees then came shortly after and while we all finished our meals (starving mode by then), it was not good enough to say that we'd come back.

I took pictures of the outdoor seating, drinks, everything, check it out. Never got the servers name, never told us, never cared after Scott stepped in  The good: First off, Scott the manager got on top of our server. After speaking up to the host after not seeing our server for 20 minutes. Great management, Now the food,  Fried zucchini, so tasty, and a great appetizer to have. Long Island ice tea, fantastic, mixed well and not too strong. Jambalaya, tasty, delicious with a small kick of spice, chicken and shrimp in jambalaya was cooked well. Finally a mousse cheesecake, which was nice to share. I'm not the b8ggest fan of their cheesecake, but my gf raves about it.

88,Tommy S.,"Houston, TX",35,205,182.0,2.0,2017-02-21,"This was my second visit at the Cheesecake Factory at Memorial City Mall. It was somewhat of a downer compared to the last time that I visited when it was first opened. Ambiance: the place was nicely decorated, but it was little dark at dinner time. Still it was not a big deal.  Service: It was a midweek night so it wasn't too crowded. Our party got seated right away. Our waiter came by, introduced himself, took our drinks order and starters, promised to come back with our breads right away then disappeared for 10 minutes.  We saw him again right around the time our appetizers came out. He came back with our breads, took our entree orders then came back again after we received our main course to ask whether everything was ok.   We had our interaction with our waiter again when I ordered desserts for our table and let him know that we were celebrating my friend's birthday. He somewhat redeemed himself a little when my friend's Cheesecake came out with a candle and a bit of decoration. Food: We ordered fried calamari which was decent and another appetizer that escaped my mind at the moment. I think both items were good. My wife ordered shrimp scampi pasta. She felt the pasta was a little dry and was lacking enough sauce. My birthday friend concurred and let our waiter know. He informed his manager and offered to give us take home orders to make up for the subpar dish. We didn't partake on his offer as we just wanted to let the restaurant know plus we had eaten more than half off the plates already due to hunger. My jambalaya pasta was alright but the pasta was a bit hard perhaps due to it being a tad undercooked. Still the dish was edible. I left about half the plate due to its large portion. The cheesecakes were as good as they were. We got chocolate cheesecake and the NY style. Both were great This visit to the Cheesecake Factory was somewhat disappointing. The service was not up to par. The food in general was below the Cheesecake Factory standard. I used to love the main course here as it was served in a big portion.  I always looked forward to eating the leftover for lunch the next day, but not this time.  Initially I was going to give an average rating of 3-star. After writing this review, I realized that my dining experience here was worse than I thought.

Chicken lettuce wraps were terrific... fresh, crisp, savory, and very flavorful. Entrees: Our table had 5 different burgers and a pasta dish.

It was just me and one other person and we waited for maybe ten minutes for a waiter to even show up and ask us what drinks we wanted. I also feel like the timing of the appetizer/entree was way off. It all got there at the same time and granted it isnt the waiters fault necesarily but still I did notice he had a few tables and didnt make it to kitchen to drop off our initial order for the appetizer in time. He was real cool though and perhaps he was new so that could explain the slower service. This location really needs to hire better hostesses thats for sure. The girls working here are uninviting and unwelcoming. I had to say HI loudly in order to get these girls to stop their conversation and acknowledge me. That was totally awkward for me to have to do and unnecessary period. The parking is always normally a nightmare here so be prepared to valet or have shitty parking.  For food choices I always recommend the eggrolls for an appetizer and any noodle dish is usually pretty good. Chicken madeira is also a tasty entree.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memorial-city?start=40,2.56,2.32,2.696,2.0600000000000005,2.416

We got our drinks from her and they forgot my husband's tea. I then after waiting another 20 minutes had to get up to ask for bread. Then after bread came it was another 10 minutes before we gave our food order.

Usually, it is pleasant which is why we return (it ain't cheap!), but today's experience made us lose our appetite. Our waitress very rudely took our drink order. Then we could see her arguing with another waitress, which resulted in her serving us instead. Our original waitress continued to wait on other tables right next to us. The new waitress felt the need to explain to us over and over that the other wanted to switch with her. It felt kinda fishy that she felt the need to explain it every time she saw us. We're an openly LGBT couple and we have never had an experience like this anywhere. For all I know this could have just been a misunderstanding, but the repeated explanation and the strangeness of it all (like how she served every single other table in that section) was off-putting.

I LOVE Cheesecake Factory but this particular location, it seems as if the wait staff hates their job and doesn't want to be there. The recent time I went, bread was not brought until after we ordered which seems to be the norm here. Not sure, but at other locations, I usually receive the bread right after we order drinks. We had to ask another waitress for refills and more bread. Also, I'm not sure what the deal is, but every time I've come here, it seems as if they cannot get the food of people at the same table to come out together. I had a pizza and salad that came out together which I would have preferred my salad first. But it was almost 6 minutes before my mom received her chicken salad sandwich and salad. How was a pizza ready before a sandwich? After ordering dessert, we paid and ate our dessert and the waitress never came back to see if wanted to take any of our leftovers to go. I had wanted to take the rest of the cheesecake but unfortunately we had to leave the rest of our dessert behind being that the waitress never bothered to come back.

133,Marc C.,"Webster, TX",79,3,3.0,1.0,2017-10-27,"As a person who never leaves reviews, (which I probably should more often as I dine in so many amazing restaurants around houston) I was disappointed enough to spend the time to write this one. I am very familiar with quality food and service as I work in one of Houston's top 5 restaurants and love the restaurant industry. Here, the food was disappointing and the service was even worse. My girlfriend made our 6-top reservation for her bestfriend's birthday. I was excited to eat here as I hadn't been in years. Our service wasn't bad too start as our server got to us in a timely fashion and took drink orders. We then moved on to ordering food. I let my server know that I have an onion allergy and would like my burger WITHOUT onions. Our dishes came out, and the first thing I notice in my open burger were onions coming off the side. The server just dropped the plates and ran off. I was able to wave him down after about 3 minutes and tell him. He then took my plate and brought me a new one (which I believe they just pulled the onions off of the same burger) but it's okay. 3 out of the 6 of us ordered burgers with sides of French fries. All 3 of our orders of fries were not only stale, but as you got to the center of them, were literally frozen cold. I'm guessing they use frozen fries which is not a huge problem, but at the very least cook them all the way through. We weren't able to tell our server immediately because he wasn't back for another 15-20 minutes. Once he finally made it back, we told him about the frozen fries. He proceeded to ask if we wanted a replacement or just a different side. Our plates were completely finished (other than the fries that had barely been touched), why would we just want to finally get a fresh side? We told him it was too late as we had already finished our plates. He just started taking our plates to throw away the remainder.  It only gets worse from here.... Before he walks off with the plates, we then told him it was (my girlfriend's bestfriend's) birthday. He says ""oh cool"" and continues clearing plates. He looks at her and asks ""do you want a cheesecake or some type of dessert?"" She says yes that'd be great. He brings her a cheesecake with a candle and sings happy birthday blah blah blah. Immediately after singing, he asks us who's tab is he charging the cheesecake to. Confused, my girlfriend looks up and says just to just add it to ours.  Now I know separate checks can be confusing, but we told him from the beginning to separate the tabs by table (it was the three couples). After some waiting, he finally brings the checks which are literally messed up in every aspect possible. I then asked for a manager to come get it situated and to let them know about everything that had happened during the meal. The manager even took about 20 minutes to come. During that time, the server came back and took the checks to fix them. I know managers can get busy, so not a huge deal. At this time, we're waiting for our fixed checks to come back. I tell the manager about our ENTIRE experience and she says ""Next time you just need to get us involved earlier so we can make sure after the first mess up that you're being taken care of.""  I wasn't aware that if I go out to eat at The Cheesecake Factory, I have to request to be taken care of by a manager just to get a decent meal with decent service. If the staff was trained properly at this establishment, maybe this wouldn't be necessary. Even then, the manager didn't even apologize for our experience. She just turned it around and said that WE needed to get them involved earlier. How pathetic. There will not be a next time. I will never dine at this establishment again.

I gently asked the staff if they could turn it down a little bit but the answer was NO! Then they send me inside and had to wait again for a new table. Once we were seated the staff didn't even asked me if I wanted water for about 15-20 minutes, I had to ask the waitress if she could please take my order. When the food came they didn't bring my sides and my daughters so we had to wait another 10-15 minutes. Finally when I asked for the check, they charged me for my daughters side (which was usually included on the meal) but apparently now they don't include it and the waitress didn't even warn me about it.... at the end, at least they removed the side charge. If I could just review the waitress NICOLE I'll give her -1 stars but since it's the first time this happens I'll just reduce my rating of the restaurant to 3 stars!!!

We didn't have a long wait (which is literally the only positive aspect of our entire evening) to get our table, but had horrid service once we got seated. Our server never introduced herself and never really paid attention to what we were saying either. According to the receipt her name is Taylor W. Our coffee came out cold and we were never offered a sugar caddy. We never got the bread basket we asked for either. We were never offered refills either. Two of our three plates came out, and the third never came out. We tried diligently to get the attention of any server, but to no avail. Our server casually passed by and said you got your food right. There was no plate there, so the answer should have been obvious. Then she brought it out like 10 minutes AFTER that but without the sides. How ridiculous is that?! My mom had had enough at this point and requested a manager. We told him what happened and he halfway apologized. He got the spinach several minutes AFTER the delayed food and then about 10 or so minutes brought us fresh coffee and sugar. He finally brought the bread basket after that. Who wants bread after the meal? We asked for the DM's info, and he finally got it after we insisted numerous times. We were never offered dessert of any kind and we were rushed after this incident. He did deduct the late meal and the atrocious excuse of coffee, but that doesn't make up for such a lack of service. This place needs to be completely overhauled with new management and a new serving team. Instead of excuses, offer sincere apologies. There is never a need for an excuse because there is no excuse for bad service. Good luck to whoever stops at this location.
