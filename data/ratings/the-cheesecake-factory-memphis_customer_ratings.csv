23,Kontji A.,"Memphis, TN",970,186,1231.0,5.0,2015-08-29,"I have always enjoyed the food at the Cheesecake Factory and the new Memphis location doesn't disappoint.  We had a great experience from start to finish.  I like the fact that you don't have to go inside the Wolfchase Galleria mall to access this restaurant. ;-)  I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory that didn't have a wait.  So expect to put your name down, get a pager and wait to be buzzed for seating.  To kill time, some people sit, others look inside nearby stores in the mall and still others go to the bar.  The menu is a million pages so you might want to google it before you get there to save time.  The good thing about the extensive menu is that there is something for everybody! I suggest you save your appetite before you go to Cheesecake Factory.  The portions are hefty and you want to make sure you have room for the delicious cheesecake.   They honestly have the best cheesecake I've ever had.  I get it plain - it has a yummy layer of sour cream on top.   Their cheesecake melts in your mouth and the food is so delicious.  Be prepared to roll outta there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memphis?start=20,2.9640000000000004,2.9640000000000004,2.9640000000000004,2.9640000000000004,2.9640000000000004

I have had Cheesecake Factory in other cities and was very excited to hear we (Memphis) was getting our very own! My coworker has her own blog and was invited to do a tasting. Luckily, she invited me as well! The staff was amazing...very friendly. Mikki was our server and she did a marvelous job at explaining the menu, and making suggestions. It was extremely crowded but you would've never known due to the fast service!! For the appetizer, we ordered the Vietnamese egg rolls..excellent choice to get the meal started. I had the chicken enchiladas for my entree and it was very tasty! My choice for beverage was the Georgia Peach...it tastes just like a peach! It's an alcohol beverage...not for the kiddies! Dessert!!!! Awww...the best thing ever... We got a chance to try their new flavor...salted carmel cheesecake...to die for!!! If you want outstanding service and good food this is the place to try!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memphis?start=80,2.9000000000000004,2.9000000000000004,2.9000000000000004,2.9000000000000004,2.9000000000000004
50,Edward H.,"Cordova, TN",211,85,383.0,5.0,2015-09-02,"The other reviews were spot on!  My wife and I had enjoyed our experience from start to finish.  The waitress we had came by quite frequently, and I don't believe our drinks ever reached the bottom.  In addition, the manager came by a few times in the beginning and asked if there was anything that they could do to accommodate us better.    The food was delicious and came out quickly!  The benefit of having a wait time (40 mins) was that my wife and I got a chance to really look at the menu.  I got the fish n' chips and my wife got a chicken salad.  Both were very tasty!!  The best part was the cheesecake - delicious!!  We each ordered 1 even though we shouldn't have.  We thought of sharing one beforehand, and we will next time.  These cheesecakes that they send out are enormous.  Def could be shared among two people.  Overall, tasty food and good service.  I don't think I could've asked for better!  Highly recommend going at least once if you have never been!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memphis?start=40,2.868,2.868,2.868,2.868,2.868

56,Susan A.,"CORDOVA, TN",8,22,16.0,4.0,2015-09-04,"Lovely experience except for the wait time. We thought going after 1:00 would be less of a crowd. Waited longer to check in than we waited to be seated. Checked in at 1:59 and were seated at 2:15, very nice surprise considering how busy they were.  Waited for service, waited for drinks, waited for dressing for my salad, waited for a to go box. My husband was done eating before I started on mine. We asked for our cheesecake to go and waited for that. We had to ask for our check. I had the; SKINNYLICIOUS® FACTORY CHOPPED SALAD A Delicious Blend of Julienne Romaine, Grilled Chicken, Tomato, Avocado, Corn, Bacon. Blue Cheese and Apple with Our Vinaigrette. My salad was delightful, fresh, chopped up in bite size pieces.  My husband had the SKINNYLICIOUS burger. He said it was good. It came with a nice side salad.  I know this is their first week, but I think we will reserve this restaurant for special occasions and certainly wait a few months for the novelty to wear off before attempting to go back. Make sure you have plenty of time for the wait. The food was worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memphis?start=40,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768

We started out with a waitress named Taylor.  She spent more time texting than serving.  She then told us she was team teaching. We then spent time with an amazing waiter named Jonathan.  Just awesome! Unfortunately, it didn't help the burnt Tuscan chicken we received. I told my daughter desert only if we come back to this location soon. Disappointed. One of my favorite restaurants...

88,Melissa F.,"Orlando, FL",22,95,136.0,3.0,2015-09-10,"I've been to different Cheesecake factories and I even served Corporate and the president at my job a few weeks ago, so I had high hopes for this location. My boyfriend and I were pretty optimistic after hearing bad reviews from coworkers.  The wait time was quoted only 15 minutes (but ended up being about 30) so we decided to grab drinks from the bar while we wait. We waited there and were never acknowledged, so we decided to wait at the lobby again. They looked weeded from making drinks for the pub/service well. We were being buzzed shortly after so we went to our table.  Our server (assistant we soon learned) greeted us with a smile and began pouring out the specials of the evening.. Before getting our drink orders.. So I didn't really pay any attention to her introduction, I just wanted a water and something with liquor. I ordered a strawberry martini and my boyfriend ordered Sam Adams beer on draft. We tried the fried macaroni cheese bites. They were surprisingly  delicious! We waited a while for the drinks to come to the table, they came right before our food came out. I ordered the ribeye and wanted it with a baked potato instead. She kept saying they had potatoes or half potatoes, but not baked potatoes.. I was confused so I said spinach instead. My boyfriend ordered the chicken Madeira.  We are both in the service industry so we noticed a lot of things.. Like 1.) lack of silent service. I shouldn't be asked if I want more water, when my food hasn't even made it to the table yet. It's just common sense. 2.) Servers not knowing their table numbers. We had people auctioning our food at other tables and coming back to us asking if it was ours, even the server delivering our drinks from the bar needed my thumbs up to sit it at our table. I normally don't mind, but if I'm spending at least 60$ on myself, I would like to know my servers are trained accordingly. I sat there for awhile waiting on my spinach and a knife to cut my steak with. 3) Lack of management involvement. My boyfriends' chicken was undercooked, so we waited and waited for the recook. Our sever asked if he wanted it to go since I would probably be done with my food.. If we wanted it TO GO, we would have went through TO GO. He even mentioned how the manager would come to the table and we never saw a manager. We never even noticed managers going to tables and checking on anyone. We DID notice managers standing around, doing nothing. We didn't ask for our server to take care of our food, but our server made us think they took off the chicken because of the inconvenience. He worded the whole "" We took care of the chicken Madeira for you both"" wrong. They took care of the re-ring for the cook up, not our meal. He shouldn't have said they took care of anything, I know what a comp is for a recook. I would be more understanding if our server was busy, but he only had us and one other table in a 3 table section. I was just happy to get my check.  The experience was definitely not a pleasant one. It was definitely the first and last time in Memphis. Maybe in 6 months they'll work out all the problems and train the staff better, the staff all had good, positive attitudes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memphis?start=80,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.7320000000000007

130,Adrienne W.,"Arlington, TN",5,24,16.0,1.0,2015-09-15,"So I decided to visit the Cheesecake Factory for a family members birthday. My experience was terrible from beginning to end. We arrived around 6 to be seated at a table for 7. We were told that the wait would be 60 mins, but over 2 hours later we still were not seated. The hostess decided to argue with me about the fact that she said my table was ready WHEN IT WAS NOT! Then she told me that she was talking to someone next to me?!?!?! Literally NOBODY was next to me. Our server was sweet and had a positive attitude however she was stretched thin.

120,Frank U.,"Arlington, TN",73,97,28.0,2.0,2015-09-15,"Food was good, the service was not good at all.  We decided to go on a Thursday night at 1930-hrs.  We expected a wait to be seated so that was not bad.  Took them one-hour to get us to a table.  Once we where buzzed, they sent us to another location to wait to be seated.  So two different waits to be seated.  Once seated, it took our waitress (Rachael C) 15-min to come to out table.  We ordered two waters and the Avocado Eggrolls to start.  10-mins later, the waters showed up.  Then our appetizers of the eggrolls which were the sampler rolls not the Avocado Rolls, which is bad because my fiance is a vegetarian and 50% of the sampler is meat related.  Waitress said she was sorry and that was it on that, no ""can I put the right order in"" or ""can I offer you something else"".  Ordered the main meals..our waters were empty, waitress stated she will get us more and she never came back.  Server came with the meals and she was the one that got our waters.  We were always out of our beverage and it was not until we were complete with our meals and sitting looking around, our waitress came back and asked if we needed anything else.  With the horrible service, I stated check only.  We skipped the cheesecake because we did not want to wait another 30-mins to get our dessert.  We did not walk out until 2300-hrs. To sum it up: 1-hr wait to be seated 3-hrs to get one appetizer, main meal and waters (with only one refill) I gave it a two because of the food being good but if I could place a star ranking for service it would of been in the negative side.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memphis?start=120,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.728000000000001

136,Amber B.,"Memphis, TN",127,1,,2.0,2015-09-23,"Ive been to several cheesecake factories around the country and this has been by far the worst. Granted, I know its new and trying to get up and running but man. I went on a Saturday night so I expected it to be crazy. We got there at 8:00. Was told the wait would be 80 minutes which was fine. We went into the mall and shopped and went back. We waited about 20 minutes before our buzzer went off. They send you to another location to wait where theres complete chaos and you aren't sure who your supposed to be looking for or whos seating you. It was a very confusing set up. Someone started yelling our name and 8 feet away was the person seating us. We were seated and immediately greeted. Server took water orders and took several minutes to return. She came with no bread and stated that the kitchen as backed up. About 15 minutes later she finally came with bread. We went ahead and ordered our food. She came by several times and would peek into booth but not close enough where I could tell her we need more bread and water. We had our empty bread basket sitting close to the edge trying to give her a hint to ask for more bread. The next thing I know a completely different server walked by and grabbed the bread basket as he walked by so fast that I couldn't ask for more. This was ridiculous. We were thirsty, breadless, and our waitress was no where to be found. Our food finally came. Mine was pipping hot. I got the Cajun pasta. My buddy got the salmon and mashed potatoes with asparagus which came out COLD and seasonless. It tasted horrible. Our waitress never came back and I had an empty glass forever it seemed like. She finally refilled and we ordered cheesecake. It took 20 minutes for a slice of cheesecake to go to come out. Okay food but ridiculous service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memphis?start=120,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007

31,Samantha B.,"Collierville, TN",217,763,2516.0,4.0,2015-09-27,"I adore the location in Nashville so I knew I had to try this one as well for my birthday and my parents' anniversary (we double up celebrations a lot lol). I will admit we had the same problems as other people with the slow service, but hopefully that fixes itself over the next year so when I return it's still amazing. I did enjoy them singing for us and I'm glad we got two pieces of cheesecake at the end so they could decorate our plates with our different celebrations. :) So much fun!  Ok, so something new I realized about this place for me: they do strong flavors really really well but muted flavors not so much. For example, the flavor-laden dish hubby got was as good as it is in the other location whereas the simpler dishes my parents and I opted for were either bland or just ok. I will have to definitely stick to strong flavors here, though that's no problem for me since I usually sway that way anyway.  I thought I heard the strawberry shortcake won some kind of award for best dessert but me and my family were not impressed. I really liked the eggroll sampler as I got to find my favorite sauces and eggrolls. We were surprised the chilaquiles here were just not that great. Chilaquiles tend to taste awesome at restaurants but these were just meh. I did find my new fav cheesecake in the chocolate hazelnut crunch.  We will definitely give them another shot next year, but if it's like being on Hell's Kitchen (which is what Dad compared it to because of the long wait to get our food) then hubbs and I will just stick to going to the Nashville location.

Okay anyway, my boyfriend and I decided to try cheesecake factory. It opened a few weeks ago and since it's a new restaurant in memphis it has been super packed. We decided to go on a Tuesday afternoon around 1 hoping everyone would be at work. Nope. It was still alot of people there. We walked up worried about how long the wait would be. The hostess let us know they had two open tables if we wanted to sit by the bar, we obliged.  We sat down and our waiter Adam came pretty quickly.  The Breakdown  Environment - it resembled pretty much every cheesecake factory. Super nice inside. However this one is a little smaller than most cheese cake factories so it feels a little crowded. Service- our waiter was great. He was efficent but not annoying. Which means that he took our orders, checked in on us, kept our drinks filled but wasn't lingering around with annoying stranger convo.  FOOD- we had fried zuchinni as our appetizer and it was super yummy!! I ordered the cajun chicken Littles which is essentially chicken fingers, mashed potatoes and corn succotash. My boyfriend got southern fried catfish which came with mashed potatoes, green beans and corn. My food was food, the chicken fried well..right amount of breading and not all breading with no chicken, loved the corn succotash. The mashed potatoes were okay, just not hot like the rest of the dish.. a little weird.   My boyfriend liked his fish, seasoned well, the green beans had no seasoning so he didn't really enjoy those.  We ended the meal with a shared slice of salted caramel cheesecake. It was the highlight of the meal. So good!! Please try it lol All in all it was a nice experience and the food was good.

122,Daniel C.,"Widener, AR",77,2,,1.0,2015-10-07,"I was passing through Memphis while on a business trip and decided to dine with Cheesecake Factory for the first time. Against my better judgement, I ignored the reviews about this particular location. I consider myself to be a foodie, and dine out often. This was the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant.  Strike 1 - While being seated, I saw an empty booth and asked if I could have that table, the host told me no. I understand the ""rotation"" policy with seating servers, but a guest should never be told no on a request that is reasonable.  Strike 2 - We weren't greeted by a server for 10 minutes. It took even longer to get drinks out. Or server also did not make a single suggestion or operate by any Step of Service. Being a corporate restaurant, I imagine servers are trained on what a step of service is. What I did see, was servers standing around not working. All congregating around the POS systems and chatting, not waiting in line to ring things in. I saw a staff that did not practice teamwork, or Full Hands In/Full Hands Out. Our server was clearly busy and dealing with more than she could handle. She was triple sat, which is an unacceptable practice and your hosts are setting up your servers for failure. Not once did I see a manager floating around or doing table visits so I could express my concerns. After placing the entree order and waiting 45 minutes, and the appetizer still had NOT arrived, we decided to leave.  In conclusion, my experience was terrible and I will never return and encourage others to do the same. Just because your company name is a chain restaurant, does not mean you have to operate like one. As we left my partner made the comment, ""this restaurant is dead, it can't even be repaired."" We weren't expecting ""fine dining,"" but we did expect to be treated as guests, not customers. A 45 minute appetizer is unacceptable, a 10 minute wait for a greet is unacceptable. A manager should have approached us to apologize for dropping the ball. Our server didn't even apologize. Even McDonalds apologizes if you have to wait longer than expected.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memphis?start=120,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006

I regret to inform you that we waited 20 minutes on straws, only for me to get up and locate another waiter for straws. She forgot to put in our appetizer, which came out a few minutes (3-5) shortly before our entree.  She NEVER checked on us for refills- or for ANYTHING for that matter. I actually had to request more water on two different occasions; not to mention, she had a reaction as if I was bothering her.. REALLY?!? Unfortunately, my salmon was not well done, as I requested. I actually had to find another waiter to locate her to send it back... This was after 15 minutes. After sending it back, she managed to check on two more tables with my salmon in her HAND....

132,Andrew O.,"Memphis, TN",41,50,9.0,3.0,2015-10-27,"I had first visited The Cheesecake Factory in Memphis back in the beginning of September. The experience then was decent, but the restaurant had only been opened a week. It was extremely busy, with a extremely long wait as one would expect. The service was adequate, and the food was good. Nothing to write home about, but they had just opened and it takes some time to get everything and everyone working together.  I wanted to wait until my next visit to Memphis, and the Cheesecake Factory to write a review, as it would be unfair to rate the experience on a newly opened restaurant. This review is mostly about my second visit.  When you walk in, and give your name you are either given a buzzer and an estimated wait time, or seated promptly like in many comparable restaurants. When our table was ready we were told to go stand behind the hostess station, this was a bit confusing for us, but we still ended up at our table. Our waiter, who had the same name as me was quick to greet us and drop off glasses of water. We took a while to order, and he was extremely patient, and friendly with us.  This place had become famous for their cheesecake, afterall it is in the name. But I seldom get to enjoy it, because they are also known for their large portions of food.  This trip did not disappoint. We knew we wanted dessert, so we skipped soups, salads, and appetizers (last time we had the Crispy Crab Wontons, and Thai Lettuce Wraps, wontons where OK, Lettuce Wraps were phenomenal) and ordered the Factory Burrito, and the Factory Burger. They both came out promptly and were done just as we ordered. They were both quite large, and a struggle to eat 3/4th of them. We could have finished, but after all we came here for Cheesecake.  We went with the Chocolate Mousse, the cheesecake portion was rich and dense, and the moose portion was light and airy. Just as it should be. The waiter split it in half for us, giving us twice as much whipped topping. Last time we had Key Lime and something that was all chocolate, needless to say we took all of the chocolate and half the key lime home.  In conclusion, this place improved drastically over the 7 weeks or so between our visits. The wait time was nothing almost nothing, the food came out quick and the order was perfect. Our server was very attentive and kind. I look forward to my next visit to The Cheesecake Factory in Memphis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memphis?start=120,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.7,3.0400000000000005

Ordered a well drink - bourbon & 7. It was not too good. Not sure if the mix was flat, diet, but did not taste right. I ordered the crab wontons which came out quickly. They were perfectly cooked, about 10-12 of them. But, honestly, the cream cheese wontons we get at our local little Chinese restaurant were better than these. They looked good, and were cooked perfect, just lacking some flavor somehow. Had a draft to finish the HH. PS, Cheesecake Factory, thanks much for you HH menu offerings. But, ID what drafts are included please so we (others I saw also asked) which drafts were part of the HH. On the way out, I bought a Reese's Peanut Butter cheesecake slice to bring home.

Boy, was I not disappointed with the Cheesecake. First, as you know, there are 33 different flavors. Trying to decide which was not easy - I narrowed it down to about 7. I went with the Godiva Cheesecake. Wow! Smooth, silky, succulent - dare I say, indulgent? One problem - I had to eat my dinner first.  Although we did have a large group and had to wait awhile to be seated, it was crowded and our server managed to get everyone taken care of and kept our glasses filled. There were many good choices of ""real food"" as well, but I went with the Chicken Pasta for my first visit. Although my pasta was not thoroughly cooked and there was little chicken in the dish, it really wasn't bad. The rest of the group enjoyed their meals. I do want to come back to try the Crispy Cuban Rolls, Fried Mac and Cheese, Chicken Bellagio, Louisianna Chicken Pasta, and others. ""Mmmm"". But, I digress. The Godiva Cheesecake was a great first choice!

I will definitely have to go back to try the items they ordered and possibly some other items off the menu. My review would have been 5 stars if my silverware had been clean and service had been a little faster but I didn't take but a tiny bit off for that because they were packed.  I definitely recommend giving it a try.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memphis?start=80,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.8000000000000003,3.0000000000000004

Special indeed. The Fried Calamari was nice, hot, and crispy, but also way too salty. My Chinese Chicken Salad would have been pretty good except the salad included some extremely wilted/decomposed leaves...kind of yucky.

They do not value their customers... My wife was given a $25 gift card for Cheesecake Factory by a co-worker. We had never been to the restaurant and were excited to check it out. We went there on Tuesday, October 13th but the manager was outside and told us that the refrigerator was broken and that their menu was limited to cheesecake, pizza, and salad. We looked at the big menu displayed outside and we decided to try the next day. The next day we came back. It was very busy, unlike the day before, so we knew the refrigerator must have been working. We waited about 10 minutes and were seated. My wife ordered the spicy chicken sandwich & fries and I ordered the dinner version of Evelyn pasta. The food was brought out minus the french fries. The person said the fries would be out soon. Our waitress walked by and made sure we were getting our fries. Our waitress then came back later and said they'd be out shortly because they just started frying some. She came back again and said that it's taking longer because one of their fryers ""exploded."" By that time, we were both finished eating. The fries were finally brought out at the same time as the check and to-go boxes. We then ate the fries, in lieu of dessert, since fries are not good as leftovers re-heated. We were never offered an alternative to the fries, nor any compensation to make up for the inconvenience that ruined my wife's meal. My wife insisted on speaking to a manager, but I said let's just wait and email the company. As we were leaving, she insisted again, so she asked the hostess, behind the center table, if she could speak with a manager. The hostess said, ""Ok,"" and went on about her job. My wife waited approximately 5 minutes and we left without speaking to anyone. Within that 5 minutes, the hostess never followed up or said that the manager was on the way.

None of these items where rich in flavor (which is a polite way of saying it was bland) even the ranch dressing was disappointing. I'm going to chalk it up to they are still new. Cheesecake factory has a really large menu and I do understand that recipes take a while to perfect. The waitress mentioned they had 300 employees. If that is the case perhaps the chef that prepared my meals hadn't fix them enough to get it right. I'm actually a big fan of the chain.

Because either I live in a parallel universe and have been to a completely different restaurant than everyone else or there are a few people on here that are just naturally unhappy people. But going through their reviews it seems like all they do is complain. (I wonder if they ever thought the problem might be with them, constantly getting shitty service everywhere you go? Maybe you should be less of snobby bitch and servers will be nice to you.) I have been here approximately a dozen times since its opening. Including training night. Each time I go the hostess staff always makes good conversation with me and most of them remember me from the previous time. Wait times are never unreasonable unless you go during the lunch or dinner rush but that's to be expected. (Unless you're the type of person that complains about traffic during rush hour, but common sense can't be taught so there's not much anyone can do to help you, yet alone any managers)  I have both sat at the bar for service and gotten tables. There have been times when service was less then spectacular. But these times usually coincide with dining during the busiest times and most of the mistakes were done by the kitchen not my server. When I brought it up to the server she apologized and had my meal remade and expedited. She even went as far as having a manager comp it off my tab. (The things that happen when you're a polite human being and recognize that mistakes happen and you don't have to be a flying douche every time something goes wrong). Even when service was lacking, I once politely informed out server that she had forgotten a condiment request, when she apologized I told her I recognized she's covering a very large section of the restaurant and that I understand how it could have slipped her mind and to hang in there. You'll never guess what happened! She brought us a free slice of cheese cake for being understanding. (Again, don't act like a douche canoe and treat people like humans and they'll take care of you)  As far as the bar goes, only once have I gone to the bar where the bartender recognized me, although they do seem to have a large rotating bar staff so that's understandable. When the bartenders are busy tending the bar and other customers (you know their job?) all it took was for me to open my mouth (that collection of muscles in front of your teeth and contains your tongue) and ask for a drink and service. Low and behold! They came over to help me! I didn't have to sit 10 mins in passive aggressive silence waiting for them to notice me while attending to 20 other people.  As far as the food goes, portions are large unless you're super fat or have a diet of 6000 calories a day be prepared to have left overs or share a meal. Prices are high, it's a fine dining restaurant, that's to be expected. You don't go into dillard's and expect to pay Walmart prices do you? (If you do, refer to my being a douche references and try to refrain from showing yourself in public, the world is a better place when you sit at home wallowing in your own hate, unless you plan on walking in front of a bus, in that case please continue on with your plans)  Summary. Don't be a pain in the ass and you get surprisingly good service. Food is great staff is wonderful. Prices are on the higher side, but you get what you pay for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memphis?start=100,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.612,3.3600000000000003

It was like it was a chore for the waitress to do her job, like we were a burden being in her restaurant. That was how I felt. I won't grade the food, because all I had was a piece of cheesecake and coffee. The cheesecake was good, not great, certainly not something to write home about, but it was decent. The atmosphere was very nice, a very clean restaurant (which it should be - it is brand new). Their menu is very cluttered and offers way to much. Perhaps they need to break it down better and get rid of certain things. Perhaps a little overbearing! But I would easily give this restaurant 4 stars if the customer service were better.

A person a few seats down from us had prosciutto missing on his Bellagio as well. I don't know if they did anything about his either. Food was sucky, and service was dismissive of it. Nobody brought us the prosciutto and we probably paid a few extra bucks on that dish for the prosciutto that we never got. It was very poor service to ignore the problem. A manger never came to address the issue either. We felt like we could have eaten better at home, as our dishes were plain and or dry due to forgotten ingredients.

I like the Thai lettuce wrap, calamari is always good too, avocado egg rolls are good and the tuna tatakki salad is good too.

But again, I have a difficult palette to please. Other people might really love it. I think with such a huge menu it might be hard to keep everything at the same level. I think this is mostly a pasta and appetizer place. Most of their pastas are great. Speaking of cheesecakes, all of them are pretty epic. You would never know they are all frozen cheesecakes shipped from their California facility. So do not freeze any cheese cakes if you buy them cause you'd be freezing them twice.

I'd heard the menu was extensive, so I wanted to check it out online first. The online menu doesn't seem to work really well with an android mobile. I could read a partial description for each item, and see a camera icon, but whenever I'd click on these, it would take me in a circle back to the start again. Also, I couldn't find any prices at all on the online menu. Price is a determining factor in making a menu choice. Remember in Slingblade, Carl wanted to know if they had French fried potatoes? Then he asked how much do you want for them? Only then was he able to make a decision to buy some of the bigguns. Without that information, I cannot make a smart choice.  We walked in and were in awe of our surroundings. It's a big place, modern, and fancy. Of course, you see the dessert counter as soon as you walk in. We arrived at 1:00 Tuesday afternoon to avoid the crowd, were seated right away, and had excellent service. The menu is massive. We all came for a small lunch with dessert. I normally don't eat sweets, but I like cheesecake occasionally, and that's what I came for. I noticed the menu does not list prices for beer and most of the desserts. I also noticed it doesn't say the size of the pizza. It still wasn't easy to make a smart choice. I was hoping the lunch menu would have something in store for me, but even the lunch specials ranged from $11.00 to $14.50. I know it's a nice place, but this is pricey. $3.00 for a glass of tea? Why? Chicken biscuits were $17.00 if I remember correctly! I don't want a complete meal, and I don't want to spend everything I have. Also, the menu is so large, that it takes a lot of research to select something. The honey wheat bread was good. The sour dough was so tough it was hard to eat. The butter was too cold to spread. The crab artichoke dip was good, but the bread was extra tough. Crab balls, Greek salad, Asian lettuce wraps were just ok. The desserts and milkshakes were excellent. We asked what kind of ice cream the shake was made from, and the waitress said it just comes in on a big truck. Hmm. Not made from scratch. We asked the server if she gets to take food home. She said they don't allow employees to take food home and they throw all the extras in the dumpster every night. Funny, the website says under fun facts under FAQ, that they donate all of the extra food to feed hungry people through Harvest. She said they make all the cheesecake daily. Funny, the website doesn't say that. Everything I could find online says the cheesecake is trucked in frozen. Not really a factory is it? More of a restaurant that buys from a factory. I can get frozen cheesecake from the grocery.  Beef? What is American style Kobe? Kobe must come from Japan, period. There's no such thing as American Kobe. What they are selling is Wagyu. Some of the steaks are labeled as premium certified black Angus. Are we talking prime, select, choice? Are they aged? Some steaks are USDA branded, but again there are no descriptions beyond that. An educated diner knows this doesn't necessarily mean that they offer a superior beef product.  What does it mean that your fish are line caught when possible? Is this supposed to enhance the perception of quality? How does the customer know when it was possible? I always thought long lines were dangerous to birds. I'm always skeptical of the marketing phrase      ""made from scratch"",  especially when it is used vaguely. ""Made from scratch"" comes from sports and means to start off without an advantage. The menu is not specific enough to make it mean anything at all. Do they grind flour? Do they make fresh pasta? Do they make their cheesecake from cream cheese, or do they make the cream cheese? Do they make the cream? I can't find any evidence (other than our waitress saying so) that this restaurant even makes the cheesecake. Then you've got Oreos, peanut butter, Graham characters, ..... it's endless. Any fast food could claim that everything is made from scratch daily, because somewhere, it is. Astronomer Carl Sagan said ""If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe."" I'm pretty sure we wouldn't even be here if not for the universe, so ""made from scratch"" wouldn't be possible.  The service and food were ok, but this just isn't the place for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memphis?start=20,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.476,2.68

66,Claire P.,"Oxford, MS",0,4,,1.0,2016-03-15,"I'm not one to typically leave negative reviews on Yelp. However, my experience on Saturday was noteworthy, and I feel like people need to know what they are about to spend a pretty penny on.  I was at lunch with my mother in law and sister in law celebrating the soon-to-be addition to our family. For those of you who can't read between the lines, I'm 9 months pregnant and about to pop. Our waiter was more than pleasant, and the meal started out well. Appetizer (avocado eggrolls) was okay, but a little on the cold side.  Next, our lunches were brought out. During the course of my Cobb Salad, I found 2 gnats. Again, like I said, I'm not typically one to complain. So, I picked those bad boys out, squashed 'em, and kept on feeding baby and me.  Here's the juicy part of the story. I look down at my next bite, which turns out to be a hunk of chicken that is so pink it's practically bleeding still. I laughed (which I do when I've reached an extreme point of aggravation), called over to the nearest waitress and asked her to go get the manager immediately. Approximately 8 minutes later, our waiter approached the table and asked if we needed refills... No. I don't need a refill, I needed your manager 10 minutes ago. Go get him/her, please.   Almost 15 minutes after my initial complaint, the manager comes up to our table, and offers to ""take care of us"". He took my plate with the still squawking chicken and my napkin full of gnat guts back to the kitchen, allegedly. Never offered to replace my meal, never came back to the table and simply wrote my meal off and offered us a slice of cheesecake for free. I'm sorry, but I don't want your stupid cheesecake. I want your job because you're incompetent. I'm spending well over 100 dollars in your establishment on a lunch table, your kitchen served me RAW MEAT, and all you want to give me is 15 bucks off of my bill? Interesting, thank you.

No crowd, no waiting to be seated, however they chose a less than desirable location first, so we asked for a ""booth"". Then they tried to put us out in the Mall, we said no thanks, there were plenty of open tables inside. We picked out a small one, (for2, we're not trying to tie up a bigger table than we need), but the ""hostess"" decided to argue with us about it! Unbelievable! Obviously it's the b- team working on Mon! Table was greasy, so we asked that it be cleaned. Our waiter came by but never a ""bus person"", after 10 more minutes we cleaned it ourselves with some lemon juice and a napkin! We had to "" steal"" clean silverware & napkins from another empty table! Waiter was in no hurry to take care of it for us. In fact, other than bringing water he never asked if we needed anything. Once our food was delivered by kitchen staff, waiter did ask if it came out the way we asked. We couldn't tell by looking at it , so he went to kitchen to find out if ingredients we'd asked to skip, were, in fact, left out...they should have told us that when it was brought out! It took a while for him to return with an extra plate we'd asked for, so we just began eating. By this time we just wanted this meal to be over with! Never an apology for the crappy service, never an explanation ( short staffed, whatever!) I think we'll just order "" to-go"" next time. It really isn't worth the trouble! Maybe they don't really want to be a ""nice, expensive sit-down restaurant"". Obviously, they don't know HOW TO TRAIN their staff to an appropriate level of competence!

Once we finally got those out, it was another ridiculous wait when the waiter came to tell me that what I had ordered was no longer available. He asked if I wanted something else. Well, yeah... How about a menu... Another long wait. I asked where my daughter's burger was, and they said they were holding it until my food order was ready. Really?? Seeing as how it had already been 45 minutes, I told them to bring hers out while I looked over the menu again. They finally brought her burger which was, no joke, frozen in the middle. Ugh. So, back it went, with my new order. Another burger arrived, better cooked, but still tepid in the middle. My steak finally came after she was finished, and no joke, cold in the middle. At this point I was done. I asked for a box, because, hell, I can cook it better at home than this place. The manager came over and apologized, which I appreciated.

The chicken was fried perfectly crisp but that was about the only thing they got right. The only thing I could taste was oil until I dug for the orange sauce, which was almost none existant. Under the chicken the carrots tasted like charr. All around it was a bad dish. I wasn't going to try that dish again so I got the Chipotle chicken and  noodles instead and it was ok. Not all together the best visit. Despite the one poor experience I will be back and would still recommend it to others. The cheesecake is always work the guilt.

I did want to visit our Cheesecake Factory, so I took advantage of a work errand at the mall to tag on a lunch visit.  Service was quick, smooth and friendly. I was greeted and seated within a minute of walking in. I had not one but two servers helping little old me.  The menu could take years to peruse. It truly is one of the largest, prettiest menus around. Every dish looks and sounds delicious. Watching food come out from the kitchen reminds me that the portions are also enormous. So, of course, I over ordered. In my defense, I did order a lunch portion of a salad. My appetizer was big enough all on its own. I had to make myself stop eating it to have room for even a few bites of salad. I do like that the server takes the leftovers away to box them up rather than doing it at the table or letting Messy Molly (me) do it. That invariably winds up with me wearing some of the aforementioned leftovers. They also offered me a To Go beverage without me even asking.  Since I wasn't going home and didn't have a cooler with me, I skipped the dessert to go. That just gives me a reason to go back out to the Hinterlands.

This was the second time in a row at the Cheesecake Factory where my family and I were seated without utensils. Waitress was double-seated so I wasn't worried she wasn't going to get to us. However, upon bringing the drinks and later our appetizer, we had to then ask for silverware. What's up with the hostesses right? Anyway, the chicken in my wife's salad was a little questionable but she got her answer upon her first bite. We had several dishes arrive at our table that wasn't ours that were sent back to the kitchen. I can only guess they made their way eventually to the correct table. Memphis is always the bastard stepchild to anything great whether it might be a department store or chain restaurant. The Cheesecake Factory is yet another example. Night and day difference between here and Nashville. This is not a restaurant where a server learns to cut their teeth but it feels like this is training ground for Waiters 101. In fact, I don't think I've seen the same employee twice since the Cheesecake Factory opened. Just an overall disappointment considering my family knows what the other locations are like.

There are headaches: The crowd, the book of a menu to sort through, the crowd.  The prices can be outrageous, but you get two meals in one basically. The shrimp platter is enough for three meals! The kid's pizza is large enough for an adult. If you invest on a meal you can heat up leftovers of, it's money well spent.

Haven eaten at another Cheesecake Factory we decided to give the one in Memphis a try. First our server seem to be inexperienced or new so service was a little slow to start, then he was sat a nine person table right next to us. He took our order, then came back because they were out of one of the entrees we ordered. I ordered a salad with no olives and an entree. About 30 minutes later our entrees were delivered then my salad came after the entrees arrived...with olives (lots of them). Finally we call manager over and told her situation, even told her we were there for my birthday. She asked if we wanted a different server....at this point only thing left was dessert to order ...we said no (giving server every chance). Another server came and checked on us even discussed my birthday (how they were gonna embarrass me). We ordered dessert (cheesecake go figure). Our server brought us the check before our desserts were delivered, ran the credit card still before desserts arrived. Then brought our desserts over and dropped them off. My best friend started to cry...this build up to special night and you drop off our desserts and don't say (or sing happy birthday) Now the night is ruined and we are both stunned. I am half way through eating my dessert when server asked my name... with a group of servers to sing happy birthday...I was almost done eating....seemed they missed the moment. Missed the whole concept of ""Special Night"". The food was good (except salad) but I can find that type a food in plenty of other restaurants.

I was soooo dissappointed just now, when I went to pick up my free cheesecake, only to find that Cheesecake Factory has decided to reduce the size of their slices. I wanted the Tiramisu but it was almost half the size it used to be. Then, when I decided to look for the tall 6 layer cake instead, I see that they have shrunk to 2/3 the height of what they were. When I mentioned the smaller slice size to the cashier, she just nodded in agreement, but had no response. Hopefully this downsizing is a management decision at this Memphis location only.  Needless to say, the price of the cheesecake is still $8.69, while the cake is $9.29, so the prices have not gone down!

25,Cindy G.,"Collierville, TN",0,3,,1.0,2017-05-15,"NEVER AGAIN!!! That sums up my experience. This was my first time at the Wolfchase location. When I lived in Nashville, I frequented the Cheesecake Factory there and had only positive experiences. I didn't expect the Memphis location to be as great, but I certainly didn't expect them to ruin my afternoon either. I stupidly made arrangements to meet my son for Mother's Day here, and I thought things would be ok if we arrived around 3:30-4pm. Not so much! We were told the wait would be an hour. We waited. And waited. And waited. After an hour, we were told it would take another 20 minutes. It took 30. After 1.5 hours of waiting to be seated (a party of 4), the hostess took us outside to the hot patio and sat us at a table where the sun was beating down on us and there was no fan nearby. I told her that they should ask people if they're ok with dining under the hot sun before assuming it's ok. She made a smart alleck comment and said she puts us where we can fit unless we are interested in waiting longer. I went inside and asked to speak to a manager 3 times. Never saw one. I told them that I actually have Systemic Lupus, and I can't sit out in the sun like that without getting very sick, possibly ending up in the hospital. They finally sat us at a table inside. Overall, it ruined my entire opinion of this place. They don't care about customer service.... not one bit. For their prices, they should treat people with dignity and respect, like any other restaurant in their price range would (considering I dropped $250 there). Oh, before we were seated, I asked why I was seeing so many people leave the restaurant but they weren't seating anyone over the 1.5 hour. She said that they were taking care of the larger parties first, and because I was just a party of 4, it was taking us longer to be seated. Do what??? So they intentionally seat larger parties first because they'll make more money!!??  The only redeeming part of this visit was the service and food after all of that happened. Service was pretty quick. I could have literally fallen out on the floor when the waiter said service would be quick because ""we haven't been very busy."" Honestly, I think they were not filling up their tables and leaving large portions of tables empty, making the waiters think that it ""wasn't busy."" The waiter was responsive and on top of things. Food came out pretty quickly. As always, the portions are always large enough to take home and eat later. Even still, if I ever return to a Cheesecake Factory, it will be the location in Nashville. I probably could have driven to Nashville and been served before the Memphis location could have seated me. Lastly, the fruit flies!! I didn't recall ordering them, but they were EVERYWHERE!!! I literally spent the entire time shooing them away from my food and drinks and trying to smush them. It's a sign of bigger problems lurking behind that we can't see, which should scare EVERYONE who eats there. Never again. Someone should contact the health department. I think that will be my next move.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memphis?start=20,2.84,2.83,2.83,2.8200000000000003,2.8339999999999996

It's rare that Cheesecake Factory Memphis gets it right and tonight was no exception.  The kids quesadilla and Alfredo pasta were both good per my daughters. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer which was heavily breaded and greasy and stuck together. My advice to you is to never order this dish. We've tried it twice and got the same result each time. My husband and I both ordered the bone in New York strip cooked medium. The manager came out after several minutes and told us it would be longer than usual because one of the steaks were overcooked but offered to still bring the overcooked steak while we waited on the medium steak. We opted to wait instead. My New York strip finally arrived and it was cooked medium well but NOT medium but quite flavorful. The mash potatoes were lukewarm per usual but the green beans were great. Then about 15 minutes later my husband's steak came out and it was a ribeye instead of the New York strip  that we ordered but he didn't complain. He said it was flavorful but his mashed potatoes were lukewarm as well but the green beans were good. We also ordered Long Island ice teas which were perfection! We would definitely get those again. Lastly, we ordered our cheesecakes to go, one vanilla bean and one banana. The vanilla bean is excellent and it's my go to Cheesecake because I don't like very rich deserts and this Cheesecake has a nice balance.

My servers' name was Hailey (sp?) and she was excellent! She knew I was having dinner by myself, so she gave me space but was very attentive. My drink glass was never empty, which was a first for me at this restaurant. I started with the spinach and cheese dip and my main course was the Ribeye steak. The appetizer was good, a little on the room temperature side instead of hot like I would have preferred, but the flavor was delightful. My Ribeye I ordered Rare and it was cooked perfectly, very juicy and tender. Will definitely be back to see this server again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memphis?start=20,3.2,2.91,2.91,,3.0260000000000007

We have never eaten at one before. I know, unbelievable right? We normally avoid chains on vacation and stick to local food. I had the bacon truffle grilled cheese and he had the Riesling chicken (which is what I really wanted, but you have to save room for Cheesecake). His was better than mine, but they were both good. The grilled cheese was messy and a little tough to bite into, but still tasty. After we ate the obligatory meal, it was Cheesecake time! I ordered the celebration Cheesecake and he had the lemon meringue. Both were good but the celebration cake was better. The layer of strawberry mousse was the best part. I couldn't eat it all because it was huge, so my husband got to eat my leftovers later in our hotel room. I would definitely recommend the celebration Cheesecake for anyone who likes cake, Cheesecake, mousse and cream cheese icing. It doesn't get much better than that combination!

21,Wanda L.,"Memphis, TN",76,29,17.0,1.0,2017-09-09,"On occasion, I end up getting a meal that would be best thrown out to the pigs.  Yesterday, a group of friends and I went to the Cheesecake Factory on Germantown Parkway in Memphis.  One of the friends had just suffered the death of her brother, and I have just recently been discharged from the hospital with pneumonia.  My friends and I all thought it would be good for us to get out for just a bit.  So .. . . this is where we chose.   I ordered the shrimp meal.  Huge, drastic mistake on my part.  This meal cost some $17.00 plus tax, plus tip.  Being on a fixed income, it is not often that I can order a meal this costly.  I was, however, quite hungry for a good meal after having been hospitalized and not eating much in the preceding days.  This shrimp was way over cooked that it was difficult to even bite it, much less chew it.  I think I managed to eat only two pieces of it before I pushed it aside and got a box to take it home.  My thought was that, after it had set a while and gotten ""soggy"" and then heated in the microwave, that it might 'soften' up a bit.  That was not the case, however,   Please trust me ---- if you want shrimp, do NOT get it at The Cheesecake Factory.  This was the most disappointing meal that I may have ever had.  I would choose Captian D's shrimp any day of the week over the mess I got at The Cheesecake Factory.  Trying to eat it was a horrible experience.  I most likely will never return there, nor will I recommend it to anyone.  It takes only ONE experience to ruin the party for me.   This was an expensive meal that was not fit to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memphis?start=20,3.32,2.89,2.89,,3.0620000000000003

Today we arrived before 5 pm to avoid the Friday dinner crowd and were seated by a ""new"" host who decided to sit us at a table in a section where the dinner server hadn't arrived yet. Who knows what time the dinner server is supposed to arrive, and frankly, who cares. It's just the latest poor host and wait staff dining experience for my family and I. A very nice server named Jessica greeted us, took our drink orders and said our actual server would be here soon. Drinks and bread came fairly quickly and then we proceeded to wait for almost 20 minutes before Jessica realized our server wasn't here yet.  Almost 40 minutes after we were seated (and 15 minutes after Jessica took our order and said she'd take care of us) our actual server shows up and then I hear her asking Jessica about our table.  Too late. I've eaten at the Atlanta, Nashville and Orlando locations dozens of times and I can't think of a single bad experience, but the Memphis location is a totally different story.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memphis?start=40,3.36,2.94,2.94,,3.108

I have been a fan of Cake for over 25 years, was so excited when they came to Memphis. At it's best, the Cheesecake Factory can be very good food, good service, in a beautiful setting. Most locations are quite good, a few locations are medium/fair, but the Memphis location is just plain bad. Actually it's the worst, by far, of any in the country. And sadly it seems to be getting worse. I'm done with it.

We were seated quickly and the server was very attentive. We received our drinks and bread/appetizer pretty quick. We ordered our food and about 30 minutes later the server came to verify our order because the computer crashed. After an hour some of the food came out but not all. We asked where the rest was and were told it was coming. The ones with food patiently waited without eating to be polite. Twenty minutes later the rest came out and our food was cold. The manager apologized and offered us all cheesecake. He said it was the least he could do. However when the server came he informed us that the manager had only agreed to 2 pieces. I told him that all 4 of us had been inconvenienced. He said he would ask the manager to agree to a piece for each of us. He came back to inform me that the manager refused. It wasn't the fact that we were only getting 2 pieces of cheesecake. It was that after our food was extremely late and cold, the manager was not even sincerely sorry for our bad experience. He really didn't care that our food was cold and very late. The Cheescake Factory doesn't need to make every customer feel valued. I guess they have more customers than they need and can treat some badly and get away with it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memphis?start=20,3.24,2.92,2.92,,3.0480000000000005

There were also pictures removed, as they came from local media, not me. I understand that and will refrain from using those.  Since they want my first hand account, here it is: Location, Location, Location On December 26, 2017, my family and I went to eat at The Cheesecake Factory in Memphis, TN to celebrate my youngest daughter's fifth birthday. It was an experience that will not soon be forgotten. The service was good and the food was wonderful. However, while waiting to order dessert, I observed a fight through the windows. Multiple individuals were fighting inside of the mall, just outside of The Cheesecake Factory. Security showed up and began forcing those involved outside. As they exited the mall (just feet from The Cheesecake Factory), approximately 8 gun shots rang out. I immediately grabbed my family and we got under the table, as did the entire restaurant. Realizing my oldest daughter (10) was in the restroom, I made my way through turned over chairs and other patrons on the floor to get to her. Once the scene appeared to be clear, I brought my daughter out of the restroom and back to the table. We continued sitting there, as multiple police cars arrived outside. I then observed police officers walking around the entrance and inside of the mall, with AR15 rifles. Just when we thought everything was under control, the officers with the riffles began running back toward the entrance where the shooting occurred. People in The Cheesecake Factory once again began screaming and got under their tables. After another few minutes of uncertainty, people began emerging from their hiding spots. Moments later, a female was taken out of the mall on a stretcher, by paramedics. We waited until it seemed as if everything had calmed down, and we paid our bill. On our way out, we observed an individual who had been shot. He was sitting handcuffed on the sidewalk surrounded by police, and was receiving medical attention.  Can I put the blame on The Cheesecake Factory? Yes, they knew the area has been declining and still chose it for their location. There are safer areas nearby that could have benefited from this business.  Additionally, it The Cheesecake Factory has any plan for an active shooter situation, it was not acted upon. The shooting happened just outside of the windows behind the cheesecake viewing area, yet the restaurant never went on lock down mode. Instead, customers were left to fend for themselves and seek their own hiding places. Also, the doors were never locked; therefore, the shooters could have easily entered the business.  As stated before, this was my five year old daughter's birthday dinner, in which she and her other sisters (6 & 10) were forced to hide under tables and brought to tears. She later woke up with nightmares, asking if there were any ""bad men"" outside. This is an experience that my family will never forget. Due to the location, I will not go back; however, I will continue to eat at The Cheesecake Factory when visiting other cities.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-memphis,3.32,2.96,2.96,,3.104

My husband and I patronized this location in November for my birthday. It was extremely loud and dark inside this establishment. Perfect environment for some shenanigans to go down. As we were seated, we saw a group of THUGS! Yes, THUGS! Wearing all red, mostly Chicago bulls gear. If you don't know what this thuggery means just look it up. They were loud, cussing and causing some kind of scene with the manager. I could not eat my salad fast enough so we could leave. I felt very uncomfortable! My husband is a law enforcement officer so he is always armed. That gave me comfort knowing he is trained to eliminate such threats if the need arises  I was thankful we did not have our child with us. I could not enjoy my birthday dinner because of the atmosphere. I got my cheesecake to go and ate it in our hotel.  It's very sad to see such great restaurants come to such great cities like memphis and these thugs running them in the ground. I would like to see Cheesecake Factory hire off duty police officers as security! I am sure after recent incidents, the security would be welcomed and would help business. I'd hate to see Memphis loose a great place to eat because of unnecessary thuggery!  P.S the Godiva cheese cake is amazing!

They have all kinds of food offering to the extent that the cheesecake is almost an afterthought. The portions are huge so if a lunch special will fill you up and the person next to you in most cases. When you order the dinner you might as well get a to go box with it. Of course it will be hard to fill that to go box and not stuff yourself as the food here tastes amazing! The price may seem like a lot, but for the amount of food you get it's more then fair.
