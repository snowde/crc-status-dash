125,Keith P.,"Washington, DC",563,629,328.0,4.0,2012-12-12,"THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY!!! YES!!!! Known for their classy, delicious, and trendy desserts! ................................ Before I continue with this review, I would just like to say that it is very difficult to review chain restaurants because they are the same. They are all run the same, have the same setup/décor, and most importantly serve the same food. And that is the truth at all of Cheesecake Factories +100 locations. However, since I would like to offer as much information as possible, I would like to compare this Cheesecake Factory to the other popular Cheesecake Factory in South Florida--- the one at Dadeland Mall. (Note: there is also one in Coconut Grove.) _______________________ DADELAND CHEESECAKE VS. DOLPHIN MALL CHEESECAKE: Which one stacks up better? Which one is better? Where should you go? Location: Dadeland is the mall for the classy and those who want to spend money. Dolphin Mall is the home for those who like to shop on a budget--they do have outlet stores after all. Also, since the mall is bigger it has more parking for its cheesecake enthusiasts, so ONE POINT easily goes to DOLPHIN MALL CHEESECAKE. Service: When I went to Dolphin Mall Cheesecake, they were really slow. I am not sure if it was because they just got trained or were nervous, but our food was slow to come out. I think someone may have made a mistake in the kitchen. But my water glass was always full because once I took a sip, the waitress was back to fill my cup. At Dadeland Cheesecake, service is relatively fast, but they have messed up my food order a couple of times which made them take longer. TIE IN THIS CATEGORY! Food: Same food, love their cheesecakes. My favorite dish is the Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp. Superb taste of coconut! The Skinnylicious menu is offered at both locations for those on a diet. TIE AGAIN! Space: It is rumored that the Cheesecake Factory at Dadeland is expanding. But even without the rumored expansion, the one at Dadeland definitely has more space. The Cheesecake Factory at Dolphin has more outside space, but the seating in the inside just doesn't match up to the one at Dadeland. ONE POINT goes to DADELAND CHEESECAKE. AND WHAT DO WE HAVE?! A TIE!!!! In conclusion, I would say both of these Cheesecake Factories have their pros and cons. Both have good food. If you are looking to shop for a day, go to the one at Dolphin Mall to take advantage of their prices. If you want a faster reservation due to amount of space, go to Dadeland. Space at this Cheesecake Factory may be especially limited because the mall gets really busy at night, but overall, I like how this chain is expanding because I do love my Cheesecake! I would definitely come here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=100,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003

Came by on a Saturday night recently and the wait was about 45 minutes, not a problem since we went and had a beer at BWW. Where i did encounter a problem was in my beloved (always order the same thing) pasta. I always order the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic...mind you this time around it came with pieces of shrimp and the tomatos were in big chunks (and this is after the meal took forever) I usually dont complain about food, because God knows what they do back there when you return the food. But I did mention to the server about the meal and she immidiately told the food manager (did not catch his name), who was just AWESOME about the whole ordeal. So because of that I will go back and order my pasta again ;) Oh and the Sweet Corn Tamale cakes were on point!

65,Larry B.,"Miami, FL",93,48,219.0,4.0,2013-02-09,"My great friends J.C., A.C., and I decided to come have a late lunch at this establishment after a series of text messages that involved a list of plausible locations to eat at.  I reluctantly agreed to come to the one at Dolphin Mall. Why reluctantly? Because I dislike the mall. It's always packed with children, tourists, and the worst thing.... the parking it's a mission! I was thinking ""Ok... we will be waiting for a good 40 minutes or more."" and... .Oh was I proven wrong! They told us the wait was going to be 15 minutes and it literally took us like 10 minutes to get seated. I ordered the soup of the day ""Cream of Chicken Soup."" It was EXQUISITE! But that was not all. I also ordered the ""White Chicken Chili"" which I've had one other time in the past along with a passion iced tea.  My friend J.C. ordered the Island Grilled Chicken. When she read the ingredients and saw that the chicken was glazed with soy she became skeptical. I told her to give it a try. That if it tasted bad to blame it on me (as if that would fix the problem if it truly tasted bad right?). Anyway, she was really pleased with her selection and the chicken was actually very flavorful, tender, and juicy. HEY J.C.! - JUICY MOUTHED! LOL Her husband A.C., ordered one of his favorite plates Chicken Alfredo (it suits him right) lol. He said it was great as well. Although it was literally showered with grated cheese because he did not tell the poor waiter to stop grating cheese until after what seemed to be like a whole two minutes. Poor waiter!  When it came time for dessert nobody really ordered any except me who ordered a Cappuccino.... in all honesty... I've HAD BETTER. If the cappuccino would have rocked my socks I would have given this review 5 starts. lol Maybe next time they'll be worthy of 5 stars. I am very stingy with my stars.

I reluctantly agreed to come to the one at Dolphin Mall. Why reluctantly? Because I dislike the mall. It's always packed with children, tourists, and the worst thing.... the parking it's a mission! I was thinking ""Ok... we will be waiting for a good 40 minutes or more."" and... .Oh was I proven wrong! They told us the wait was going to be 15 minutes and it literally took us like 10 minutes to get seated. I ordered the soup of the day ""Cream of Chicken Soup."" It was EXQUISITE! But that was not all. I also ordered the ""White Chicken Chili"" which I've had one other time in the past along with a passion iced tea.  My friend J.C. ordered the Island Grilled Chicken. When she read the ingredients and saw that the chicken was glazed with soy she became skeptical. I told her to give it a try. That if it tasted bad to blame it on me (as if that would fix the problem if it truly tasted bad right?). Anyway, she was really pleased with her selection and the chicken was actually very flavorful, tender, and juicy. HEY J.C.! - JUICY MOUTHED! LOL Her husband A.C., ordered one of his favorite plates Chicken Alfredo (it suits him right) lol. He said it was great as well. Although it was literally showered with grated cheese because he did not tell the poor waiter to stop grating cheese until after what seemed to be like a whole two minutes. Poor waiter!  When it came time for dessert nobody really ordered any except me who ordered a Cappuccino.... in all honesty... I've HAD BETTER.

141,Iris C.,"Miami, FL",203,49,288.0,2.0,2014-01-22,"Came here twice, and you would think it would be like any other cheesecake factory experience, but it's not. First of all, the service here is super slow, I understand that the restaurant is located at Dolphin mall which has more foot traffic when compared to Dadeland, but still the service and quality shouldn't change.  The first time I came here, we ordered the tomato basil pasta, and the pasta was under cooked. The waitress tried to play it off stating that it was ""al dente"" but it was far from being ""al dente"" so the waitress took it back to the chef, and they supposedly made us a new plate.

First of all, the service here is super slow, I understand that the restaurant is located at Dolphin mall which has more foot traffic when compared to Dadeland, but still the service and quality shouldn't change.  The first time I came here, we ordered the tomato basil pasta, and the pasta was under cooked. The waitress tried to play it off stating that it was ""al dente"" but it was far from being ""al dente"" so the waitress took it back to the chef, and they supposedly made us a new plate.

335,Natalie A.,"Miami, United States",0,15,,3.0,2015-02-08,"I usually have wonderful experiences at The Cheesecake Factory, but I had never been to the one at Dolphin and it was a very underwhelming experience, unfortunately. First off, too many tourists. They walk in with the enormous suitcases that they just purchased at the mall and take up all the room in the tiny lobby of the restaurant. The doors are opened so frequently that the lobby is more of a sauna; full of hot air and it feels disgusting. Plus, the constant wind from the door opening does nothing good for your hair. Don't ever wait for your table in there; it's better to wait outside. Second: Dirty, dirty, dirty. I joked with my boyfriend that the restaurant was so dimly lit because they wanted to try to cover up how dirty everything actually is, and I probably wasn't too far off. The floor by our table was disgusting; crumbs and God knows what else all over the place, and my boyfriend said his side of the floor felt wet. Two bussers came to clean up the table next to us after the family had left and did what can only be called a mediocre job. My boyfriend used to be a busser, and he was shaking his head the whole time as he watched in horror how they ""cleaned"" the table. What looked like a dirty cloth was carelessly swiped across the table a few times, and then the CLEAN utensils were placed directly onto the table (with no napkin or plate beneath them) by the bare hands of the second busser, who was grabbing the utensils by the part you put your food on. Gross. My boyfriend said that bussers probably have the dirtiest hands next to the dishwashers (because they are the ones that pick up the dirty plates and cups when everyone leaves), and these were the guys touching the clean utensils people were about to eat with. Why not wrap up the utensils in napkins like every other restaurant? Needless to say I was a little disgusted.  Granted, we went on a Saturday night to Dolphin Mall (always a mistake because of parking, crowds, and wait times) so service was not the best. I told the waitress to give me max five minutes to decide on what I wanted to order, and she avoided our table for the next fifteen minutes. She was kind, always made sure we had water, and brought me extra cheese for my pasta immediately. But, she took a long time in coming around to take our orders and it was hard to get her attention to come to our table. I can only complain about one aspect of the food; the complimentary bread that they brought was stale. We were given one of each bread, and the white one was hard as a rock. You could tell it wasn't made fresh, that loaf had been sitting somewhere for hours and that's what they brought us. The other loaf was warm and soft; that's how you know.  Our meals were delicious because you can't go wrong with anything at the Cheesecake Factory. The plates are enormous and you will definitely leave in a food coma. The cheesecakes are delicious and big enough to split between two people (although my boyfriend claimed he could have finished the mango key lime cheesecake all by himself). I have no complaints about our food, it was great, but the overall experience was not what I had anticipated from this restaurant. I think it's just the location and the fact that it was a Saturday night, but the mediocre cleaning done by bussers is something to worry about. I'll stick to the Dadeland location for future outings.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=140,2.8,3.0,3.0,3.0840000000000005,2.9200000000000004

Our pasta was undercooked, watery and the chicken in the fettuccini looked like it was boiled rather than grilled and my husband's pizza was chewy. Not even my kids liked it, they didn't have the crayons and coloring paper that they usually give to kids in restaurants to keep them entertained. I am very disappointed and I will never go back, I rather eat at Olive Garden or Macaroni and Grill. And to top it off our bill was $100 for just 2 items from the kids menu a small personal pizza for my husband and my chicken fetuccini all from the lunch menu with no alcoholic beverages.

You'll love eating here; that is, if you can bypass paying a few dollars more for dishes including those you can find at other restaurants. It was an early Monday evening, but my family, friend and I got a table in seconds. Expect most of the tables to be taken when you come in the evening. Huge parties of people would come here for birthdays. Our party sat at a four-person table while I took an extra chair. The restaurant interior is one of the most intricate and distinctive restaurant interiors I've ever seen - so classy and top-notch. I also like the Picasso-style art over the kitchen. The Cheesecake Factory has the widest variety of food I've ever seen in a menu: burgers and sandwiches, pasta, tacos, chicken, steak, seafood, salads, as well as reduced-calorie SkinnyLicious options. I like that most of their dishes are unique - maybe that explains why their menus are so big, and that people come here so often. It's unlikely that you'll find these dishes anywhere else.

They had a few quality control issues - some corn in my spinach, and one order was lost. I ordered a steak medium rare but it was well done, although not bad. The grilled broccoli was almost raw. It was a holiday and they were rushed and dos accommodate a large party and I am sure on other occasions they will do better. It's just ok as far as cheesecake factories go, and it's decent but not great. The server was very nice and attentive. For the price it's probably worth the money.

289,Sanita M.,"Tampa, United States",126,383,2143.0,3.0,2015-07-27,"I have always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory - great food (dinner and cakes) but I came in for breakfast and this was one of my least favorite meals. We stayed at the hotel right next to the mall, and usually we do have breakfast at the hotel were I enjoy potatoes and scrambled eggs. This time we decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory. I never had breakfast here before but I absolutely love their dinner dishes like salads, tamale, etc., and of course the cakes. Anyways, in my opinion this is not a good place for breakfast. First, breakfast items on the menu are pretty expensive, the portions are small and the quality (plus, the wait!) is not worth the money. Breakfast cost about $12 and it had 2 eggs (scrambled, my choice), 3 slices of tomatoes and brick hard, over fried potatoes, that were very oily. I love potatoes, I even order mash potatoes on the side, but I think these were the worst potatoes. Not only they were oily, they were almost burned, so hard I could not stick a fork in them. When I asked the waitress why potatoes are so hard and tiny, she said ""That's the way they are here!"" Hmmm.. ok, good to know. As for my husbands dish, he ordered Eggs Benedict with Canadian bacon and it came out with oily (I guess it's American style) bacon with almost no meat, just fat. She did apologize though and bought out the right bacon on a side. So I'm giving two stars for my visit here because I liked my scrambled eggs. We also ordered a cake to go. Have to admit, that Oreo Cheesecake was way, way too sweet, so no extra star here. P.S. I think that Cheesecake Factory should learn how to cook breakfast potatoes.

177,Natalie A.,"Miami, FL",0,15,,3.0,2015-08-02,"I usually have wonderful experiences at The Cheesecake Factory, but I had never been to the one at Dolphin and it was a very underwhelming experience, unfortunately. First off, too many tourists. They walk in with the enormous suitcases that they just purchased at the mall and take up all the room in the tiny lobby of the restaurant. The doors are opened so frequently that the lobby is more of a sauna; full of hot air and it feels disgusting. Plus, the constant wind from the door opening does nothing good for your hair. Don't ever wait for your table in there; it's better to wait outside. Second: Dirty, dirty, dirty. I joked with my boyfriend that the restaurant was so dimly lit because they wanted to try to cover up how dirty everything actually is, and I probably wasn't too far off. The floor by our table was disgusting; crumbs and God knows what else all over the place, and my boyfriend said his side of the floor felt wet. Two bussers came to clean up the table next to us after the family had left and did what can only be called a mediocre job. My boyfriend used to be a busser, and he was shaking his head the whole time as he watched in horror how they ""cleaned"" the table. What looked like a dirty cloth was carelessly swiped across the table a few times, and then the CLEAN utensils were placed directly onto the table (with no napkin or plate beneath them) by the bare hands of the second busser, who was grabbing the utensils by the part you put your food on. Gross. My boyfriend said that bussers probably have the dirtiest hands next to the dishwashers (because they are the ones that pick up the dirty plates and cups when everyone leaves), and these were the guys touching the clean utensils people were about to eat with. Why not wrap up the utensils in napkins like every other restaurant? Needless to say I was a little disgusted.  Granted, we went on a Saturday night to Dolphin Mall (always a mistake because of parking, crowds, and wait times) so service was not the best. I told the waitress to give me max five minutes to decide on what I wanted to order, and she avoided our table for the next fifteen minutes. She was kind, always made sure we had water, and brought me extra cheese for my pasta immediately. But, she took a long time in coming around to take our orders and it was hard to get her attention to come to our table. I can only complain about one aspect of the food; the complimentary bread that they brought was stale. We were given one of each bread, and the white one was hard as a rock. You could tell it wasn't made fresh, that loaf had been sitting somewhere for hours and that's what they brought us. The other loaf was warm and soft; that's how you know.  Our meals were delicious because you can't go wrong with anything at the Cheesecake Factory. The plates are enormous and you will definitely leave in a food coma. The cheesecakes are delicious and big enough to split between two people (although my boyfriend claimed he could have finished the mango key lime cheesecake all by himself). I have no complaints about our food, it was great, but the overall experience was not what I had anticipated from this restaurant. I think it's just the location and the fact that it was a Saturday night, but the mediocre cleaning done by bussers is something to worry about. I'll stick to the Dadeland location for future outings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=140,3.8,3.34,3.34,3.1800000000000006,3.524

Came with a party of 8. The hostess said the wait would be an hour long and gave us one of the beepers. It toke exactly one hour for us to get seated. Got here at 6:05pm and got seated at 7:05pm. Our waiter was a very sociable and energetic person. He immediately toke our drinks. I got strawberry lemonade. It was $4.95, the glass holding the lemonade has cystal sugar along the top lining. When ordering the entrées, the waiter would make a positive side comment on how the food choice we were making was excellent. Got annoying after he got the 5th order out of the 8. The waiter gave us 1 basket of bread with butter on a side plate. The bread basket comes with 2 mini loaf of wheat bread and 1 mini loaf of white bread. The white bread's crust was too hard, not burnt hard, but the hard that results when the time between baking the bread and eating it is long. On the other hand, the wheat bread was crispy, I could easy cut into this bread, and the inside was still warm and chewy. We got our food around 7:45 so it was like a 35 minute wait from ordering to receiving food. I got the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Note: the lighting is weird inside the restaurant. The lights give off as a shade of orange so everything in the restaurant looks like it's a shade of orange. When I got my pasta entrée I could not tell if I had gotten chicken or shrimp as the meat because the lighting made my entire dish orange colored, but once I tasted it, I could tell that it was chicken. Also, when it says SPICY Chicken Chipotle Pasta, it literally means spicy. I love spicy food no matter how extreme the spiciness is, but as a warning, don't get this platter if you do not like extremely spicy food (from 1 to 10, this is a level 9 spiciness). The waiter was around every now and then to make sure everything was good. When it came to getting boxes for our leftovers, we 1st asked for 3 boxes, but then realized we needed more. Gladly, the waiter didn't seem to mind making 2 more trips for boxes and bags.

When ordering the entrées, the waiter would make a positive side comment on how the food choice we were making was excellent. Got annoying after he got the 5th order out of the 8. The waiter gave us 1 basket of bread with butter on a side plate. The bread basket comes with 2 mini loaf of wheat bread and 1 mini loaf of white bread. The white bread's crust was too hard, not burnt hard, but the hard that results when the time between baking the bread and eating it is long. On the other hand, the wheat bread was crispy, I could easy cut into this bread, and the inside was still warm and chewy. We got our food around 7:45 so it was like a 35 minute wait from ordering to receiving food. I got the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Note: the lighting is weird inside the restaurant. The lights give off as a shade of orange so everything in the restaurant looks like it's a shade of orange. When I got my pasta entrée I could not tell if I had gotten chicken or shrimp as the meat because the lighting made my entire dish orange colored, but once I tasted it, I could tell that it was chicken. Also, when it says SPICY Chicken Chipotle Pasta, it literally means spicy. I love spicy food no matter how extreme the spiciness is, but as a warning, don't get this platter if you do not like extremely spicy food (from 1 to 10, this is a level 9 spiciness). The waiter was around every now and then to make sure everything was good. When it came to getting boxes for our leftovers, we 1st asked for 3 boxes, but then realized we needed more. Gladly, the waiter didn't seem to mind making 2 more trips for boxes and bags. The food and service was excellent, I enjoyed my experience here overall, with the exception of the long waiting time.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=120,4.0,3.32,3.32,3.248,3.592

My friends got a table and we joined them later. Let's start off by saying that the server greeted us as soon as we sat down and took our drink orders. We then ordered appetizers and our meals right before the drinks came. I'm not sure if it was because the restaurant was full (mind you it was Tuesday) or the kitchen was under staffed but out food took really long. We got another round of drinks by the time the appetizers came, and another before our meal arrived. What saved the night was that our server was being super attentive and was nice enough to bring us more bread and butter refills. I ordered a Cobb salad with crispy chicken and it was very delicious but it was HUGE! None of my friends had any complains about their food either. Tried their salted caramel cheesecake for the first time and I'm ranking it on top of the Oreo one. They even wrote happy birthday on my boyfriend's cheesecake! Overall a great experience.

My friends got a table and we joined them later. Let's start off by saying that the server greeted us as soon as we sat down and took our drink orders. We then ordered appetizers and our meals right before the drinks came. I'm not sure if it was because the restaurant was full (mind you it was Tuesday) or the kitchen was under staffed but out food took really long. We got another round of drinks by the time the appetizers came, and another before our meal arrived. What saved the night was that our server was being super attentive and was nice enough to bring us more bread and butter refills. I ordered a Cobb salad with crispy chicken and it was very delicious but it was HUGE! None of my friends had any complains about their food either. Tried their salted caramel cheesecake for the first time and I'm ranking it on top of the Oreo one. They even wrote happy birthday on my boyfriend's cheesecake! Overall a great experience.

We spent about 30 minutes trying to find parking. When we finally got to the restaurant we were lucky enough to be seated quickly because there were two of us and we were willing to sit outside. Luckily it wasn't too hot. The waiter was kind but because there are so many items on the menu (over 250!) or maybe they were new, it took us a while to order. I also love that they now have the calorie information for every item. This is something we took into consideration as well when making our choices. Our food took a reasonable amount of time and I am very appreciative that they were able to remove mushrooms from my pasta as I cannot eat them.

However, I had not been there in a couple of years and decided to visit because I was craving their Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Getting there is a struggle because this restaurant is located in Dolphin Mall and if you've never been there, beware! Parking is always a mission, especially on weekends. We spent about 30 minutes trying to find parking. When we finally got to the restaurant we were lucky enough to be seated quickly because there were two of us and we were willing to sit outside. Luckily it wasn't too hot. The waiter was kind but because there are so many items on the menu (over 250!) or maybe they were new, it took us a while to order. I also love that they now have the calorie information for every item. This is something we took into consideration as well when making our choices. Our food took a reasonable amount of time and I am very appreciative that they were able to remove mushrooms from my pasta as I cannot eat them. Overall it was a very good dinner but I feel their outside area could use more attention since it is so hot in Miami and the booth we sat in was a bit dirty.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=20,3.84,3.42,3.428,,3.588
