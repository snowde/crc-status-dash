Now, if they could just do the same for the cheesecake portions---WOW! but I don't think the world is ready for a normal slice of cheesecake. It was total chaos though. 40 min wait, dash to steal a table at the bar, kids running around everywhere, it was so dang loud we could barely hear ourselves talk. tsk tsk tsk.. Here is the worst part..can someone pls tell me wth happened to the presentation of the avocado egg rolls? If I didn't know what they tasted like, I would have sent them back. White Chinese noodles on a white plate and a poorly cut hot mess I got! Come on people, get it together- food attracts through the eyes...Thank God they are so good otherwise I would have though twice before diving in. Our server was real pleasant, always checking up on us, quick to help and that is a must. Whenever I go back...I must remember- lunch only! or better yet, I can make those egg rolls and that cheesecake at home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=280,3.8,3.8,3.8,3.504,3.8
134,Jorge M.,"Miami, FL",693,499,5495.0,4.0,2012-01-29,What can i say. This is one of the rare  chain restaurants that i like! Its located in Dadeland mall. Parking is everywhere if you are one of the Lucky's ones who find it. Just come before 12 if you can for lunch and theirs plenty of parking.The restaurant is large plenty of seating and bar area is a nice size. When I Go I normally sit at the bar and catch up on sports on their TVs. People dont like to eat their food at the bar but i do.Great service and food comes out quicker I have noticed. The restaurant and bathrooms are kept clean.The staff and bartenders are great. My favs to get are the stuffed mushrooms on their small plate menu and their Crusted Chicken Romano with Spaghetti. Sooo Good. Then comes dessert. Its the hardest thing to chose on their menu in my opinion. I go for their Dulce de Leche Cheesecake. Mmmmmmmmmmmm just getting hungry writing this review.

The bread is good, the salads are a heaping mess and it took me 20 minutes to find the chicken buried underneath. I used to like this place better years ago.

We were told the wait time was 35 minutes but 20 minutes later we were seated. The server was very polite and helpful, took her time to answer our questions about their new skinny menu, which I may say it's great. The food was very good and my daughter's Oreo shake was the bomb.  The managers stop by our table to make sure our service was good. I think more restaurants should do this more often. I mention to my husband that even the girl that brought our food to the table made sure we were set before she left. Yes it might be a little loud but who cares when service and food are great.

It was so packed with people waiting for tables that even the waiters had trouble moving around. We weren't allowed to be seated until our entire party had arrived (fine...) We had to give up our table. When everyone was ready, the hostess (don't know her name, but she had about a pound of dark eyeshadow on) promised we would get the next available table. Then she seated a different group and refused to acknowledge her mistake. She got pretty snappy, which I thought was incredibly rude, but that's Miami for you, I guess...

Then we started off with the pear and cheese flatbread which was delicious and some coffee that was spot on.  On to the main entrees, I had the montecristo which was not that good, they do it on french toast bread which was soggy and not properly toasted making it not that flavorful as i was hopeing for, the only good twist was they brought strawberry jame as most places give it with raspberry compote and hash browns which were cold, I left them completely.  My husband had the hurvos rancheros which the tortilla(quesadilla) portion to me was horrible.  We then proceeded to go with the pina colada cheesecake which was a first for me on the menu, i defeintely did not like and nor my husband and he usually likes anything sweet, we left a piece of it, that tells you a lot, as most cheesecakes are so good that you have to eat it all.   Service was excellent and atmosphere was great as it wasnt too full since it was before 12.  Defintely will be back but not ordering those plates.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=340,3.68,3.68,3.68,3.5,3.6800000000000006

I have never had a problem with the service even when they are jam packed so A+ to the servers and the hostesses that seat everyone. The food is great and I love that they are always switching their menu.

Dessert! The reason why this place gets a five star rating. Their phenomenal selection of cheesecake! Be prepared people because they have not one but two pages of cheesecake flavors. All the flavors are mouthwatering, I always have to play eenie meenie minee moe with the cheesecakes just to pick which one to eat that day. I have yet to find one that didn't leave me begging for more. But I don't like cheesecake...**collective gasp**...besides that being impossible in my mind, (ok ok it is possible, I just really like cheesecake, it's ok if you don't like it.) they have a whole array of different non cheesecake desserts which are sure to appeal to the non cheesecake eaters of the group.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=280,3.64,3.64,3.64,3.7,3.6400000000000006

207,Brett H.,"Rochester, MN",68,320,,4.0,2012-05-28,"What can you say about the Cheesecake Factory that people don't already know. I live close by so its easy for me to just walk over and pick up some cheesecake to go. If you are looking for the best cheesecake, its the Godiva Chocolate. However, if you are in the mood for something lighter, then I suggest the Tuxedo Chocolate or Chocolate Mousse. The place is always packed so know that ahead of time. It takes time just to get cheesecake to go. *Added 11/21/12 My recent trip to this Cheesecake Factory warranted an addition to my review and the loss of a star. So while I enjoyed a great meal, I decided to go to the cheesecake counter and get a slice to go. With 5 employees there, I figured it wouldn't take too long. I waited probably 5 minutes before anyone even said a word to me. They never acknowledge my presence. Finally, I asked one of them if I could get an order in and they said the cashier would be right with me. Turns out the cashier was none of them but another girl who finally came back. Now I can understand that they may be busy but here is how you handle the situation properly. If you are getting the cheesecakes ready and you see a customer standing, waiting for service, if you can help him, you do so. If you can't, at least tell him ""sorry for the delay, someone will be right with you"" or something to that extent. DO NOT IGNORE HIM. It really pisses me off when I get poor customer service and I guess I this place, you might run into that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=340,3.8,3.8,3.8,3.248,3.8

We were impressed. First of all, we got there around 8 p.m. and saw that there was a big line just to place our name in the list. We waited in line for about 7 minutes and then we were told there was 10 minutes wait for our party of 2. That was fine for us compared to what we heard to other parties waiting in line: 25 minutes. However, our name was called in about 5 minutes. Very fortunate. We were seated and we perused the menu until our waiter Jose came to greet us. He told us about the specials for the day and we proceed to order. I wanted to drink something refreshing with a little alcohol and decided on the while Sangria. Jose truly recommended it and even told me that if I did not like it he would gladly exchange it. Usually they bring out a basket of white and pumpernickel bread. My boyfriend, knowing we had the same taste, told our waiter to bring out only white bread.  While we were waiting for our drinks and decided on our entrees, our water and bread with butter immediately came. I ordered the chicken teriyaki which consisted of chicken breast charbroiled with teriyaki sauce, served with steamed rice. My boyfriend ordered the Orange Chicken which was deep fried pieces of chicken breast covered in a sweet and spicy orange sauce. Served with white rice and vegetables. Ok so my White Sangria was delicious. Very fruity, sweet and refreshing. My teriyaki chicken was great. What I did not know is that the chicken is served with the skin which the teriyaki sauce is on it. I don't eat chicken skin,  and if i known that I would have ordered to take the skin off and place the teriyaki on top of the skinless breast but it was tasty after all. I rubbed my meat on top of it just to give it the teriyaki flavor and the steamed rice had a bit of the teriyaki sauce on the side of it just to make it sweeter. I tasted a piece of my boyfriend's Orange Chicken and it was great but glad I did not ordered that plate as I was not in the mood of eating fried food that evening. He said it was very good.

I have always enjoyed how large their menu is especially when you have no idea what your in the mood for. This menu helps satisfy any craving.  From the moment we sat our server took our drink order ASAP. He was rushing us for some reason. I was not digging his energy or attitude at all.  After finding a salad that seemed like a great choice I ordered the Carlton Salad. The menu stated balsamic dressing. I asked the server for extra dressing.  We ordered stuffed mushrooms to start and they were delightful.  The server had brought over a small cup of the dressing.  Immediately I was like oh that color, texture does not look good. I dipped my fork in it and ugh it was awful. Creamy texture with a robust taste of peanuts and sweet.  I'm like WTH. Minutes has passed when I called our server over to the table. I first asked if possible he gave me the wrong dressing. He said no that's the balsamic. I asked if he could make sure the dressing was not poured on my salad and I would choose another. He rudely said well I'm sure your salad is done so nothing I can do. Mind you this is after I told him how awful it was.  Ok long story short my salad came out with the awful dressing on it. I asked for another dressing to pour on top to try and mask the flavor. The salad was fresh, it would have been perfect if not for the peanut dressing,  When a manager came over she said yes that's the right dressing. I explained to her either they should specify peanut dressing on the menu or explain what it taste like to guest if they order it. Luckily I don't have a peanut allergy otherwise I would be dead.  This just really put a bad taste in my mouth how they handled it. She did say if I disliked it she would replace it with another salad.

But, the last time I went there really took the cake (or should I say, ""cheesecake"" buh dum tiss) for terrible experiences.  I ordered the Evely's Favorite Pasta, which tasted kind of sour and wasn't very good but I was starving, so didn't complain.  Two of my friends had the Fettucini Alfredo... big mistake. We leave, and go along our merry way to hang out at a lounge. About an hour into our fun girl's night out, my friend runs to the bathroom and gets sick. Mind you, we didn't drink and we hadn't eaten for hours before going to cheesecake.  About two hours after that, we decide to head back to my place and head our separate ways. My other friend who had the Alfredo, says she feels fine, says good bye and gets into her car. As soon as she turns on the car, she swings open the car door and yacks violently all over my driveway. Coincidence? I think not!  The next day, we call to complain. Well, that didn't work out initially. The manager who I spoke with was extremely dismissive. He had the audacity to tell me, ""Well, we make all of our sauces for each plate from scratch, it's not like they're sitting there in one batch."" Really? Really guy? You're going to tell me that you people make sauces from SCRATCH for each individual order you get on a very busy Friday night and yet manage to take only 10 minutes to get it to your customer? You must think I had a botched lobotomy, or something. Even if you did in fact, make each sauce individually, it doesn't negate from the fact that the ingredients may not have been fresh. I highly doubt it was pure coincidence that both of my friends got sick from the same exact dish when they hadn't eaten anything but that in several hours.  Luckily, we called later that day and the second manager was extremely professional and apologetic. He gave us the information to report the incident to corporate.

Since I dined with a group of 7, we devoured the bread in a few seconds! But the server brought us more brown bread within seconds, which was fresh and warm. I ordered a spicy chipotle chicken pasta to share with my sister, the portion was HUGE! Which I'm happy for because it makes the price worth it. The pasta was thrown in a creamy redish sauce, hence the the ""spicy"" part, and tortilla chips were added in for a crunchy kick, which was enjoyable. It was yummy, but not as yummy as the regular chipotle pasta they used to have. I guess they took it off the menu unfortunately, still a pleasant  entree though! To end the meal, we ordered a tiramisu cheesecake. I absolutely love the way they fused tiramisu cake with cheesecake, with the powdered top, bottom tiramisu cake texture, and cheesecake middle. It was light, the chocolate whip cream on top wasn't too heavy but a fluffy cream. Perfection. Definitely try this cheesecake and their flavored lemonades!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=180,3.08,3.51,3.51,3.156,3.338

She comes back we order and we tell her to please bring my daughters food out first. So she can start eating right away. Then a couple sits next to us on the next table down. They order and get there food before my daughters food ever even comes out. By the time the food came out I was already full from the bread and water settling in my stomach. Need less to say I had to ask for the rest of the food to go. I ask for a to go box and they check and she brings the box and forgets the check. Then I had to wait another 5 mins. for the check.

Wife enjoyed them (she loves sundried tomato, so their heavy handed inclusion didn't faze her). The tuna carpaccio was pretty dreadful; wasabi aioli with little flavor (might as well have been mayo), and a sweetness to the dish that totally overpowered the tuna.

175,Cristina G.,"Miami, FL",9,33,10.0,1.0,2014-12-14,Today I went to cheesecake factory for an early birthday dinner with my fiancé. I was so excited to eat here because it is my favorite restaurant but unfortunately it wasn't a great experience. Once we sat down we waited about 15 mins before anyone came to even take our drink order or say hello. Then we ordered an appetizer. Again about 15-20 mins before the waiter came to take our dinner order. Then we asked when our appetizer was coming and he said he was going now to get it. About 20 mins later our dinner came out and yet the appetizer never came. So we had to cancel it which was a disappointment. We never got refills on our water. The best part of my dinner was the dessert at the end which took 30 mins to come out. Then we were given the wrong bill and had to wait again for the waiter to come back and ask for the correct check. I just wish that there would've been some sort of apology for forgetting us the entire time we were there. I never thought that at a restaurant we needed to be searching for the waiter the whole time in hopes of being noticed. We are very disappointed and I hope it never happens again.

We ended up being disappointed with just about every part of the meal. First of all, a 40 minute wait in heels with absolutely nowhere to sit was terrible. The entire waiting area was a circus. It looked like the entrance to some kind of overrated night club. The hostesses were attempting to yell names over the roar of the crowd. Apparently the pagers they give you are completely pointless because if you stray out of yelling range you'll never get sat. The experience didn't get too much better once we eventually were seated. It was still incredibly loud at our table even though we were sitting in a separate dining area from the main restaurant. Our waitress was barely ever around and every time she was at the table she seemed like she was in a rush to get away again. I ordered the baja chicken tacos. They were so soggy that they fell apart completely every time I took a bite. Thankfully the tortilla chips I had leftover from the spinach dip actually made the dish edible. Another person ordered garlic noodles with shrimp which was just overly greasy pasta with 4 overcooked shrimp. The other people at the table were happy with their salads. Dessert was the best part but they couldn't get that right either. We ordered 2 different cheesecakes which were delicious and an apple crisp that looked like ****. It was literally swimming in melted ice cream and had a huge exaggerated dollop of whipped cream in the middle. Not to mention ""Happy Birthday""  written in chicken scratch on the plate. Horrible presentation. Once I got rid of 80% of the whipped cream and swam through the ice cream soup to get to the actual dessert, it was delicious. I'm only giving it the 2nd star because the spinach dip and the cheesecake were good.

The chocolate overpowered The Oreo cheesecake.  The other cheesecake that we got, the white chocolate raspberry,was excellent. I don't like raspberries but this cheesecake change my opinion about it!

375,Alana A.,"Miami, FL",583,358,893.0,4.0,2015-11-09,"This Cheesecake Factory is very good! I've never had a negative experience other than the wait times. This place gets packed and there's no calling ahead or making reservations, so just be patient and wait it out. Waiting has become more comfortable now ever since they expanded the restaurant and put more benches in the new waiting area.  Now onto the rest of the experience.... The food here has never disappointed. I've had a variety of things and have come with lots of different people and everyone is always very pleased with the food. On my last visit, I tried the Crispy Cuban Rolls ""snack"" plate as what I thought would be an appetizer, BUT it was more than enough to fill me! Be aware that the portions are proportionally huge (for a snack, it was a pretty big plate; don't even get me started on how humongous the entrees are). The bread of course is also amazing. I had a drink at the bar once and it was also very good. However, I usually have the strawberry lemonade and it is SO good!! If you're a lemonade lover, you will NOT be disappointed. It is very sour and sweet -- it's an absolute ""must"" every time I come here! Service is always absolutely excellent. The restaurant and its restrooms are always very clean as well.

I came here with a friend on a recent Sunday at around 12:30 for brunch.  We were seated at a table for 2 in front of the place (in other words, in the cordoned off area that juts out into one of the main interior corridors here at Dadeland Mall), and we were then basically neglected for the remainder of our time here.  We placed our orders and we noticed that nearby tables who'd ordered after us received their food several minutes before we did.  The glass of water I ordered with my beverage never came until I asked for it again when our food was finally delivered.  Once we were done with our meals, we sat there for quite a few minutes with no one checking on us before I finally asked one of the other servers for the check. After the check was delivered and we placed our cards inside the pouch, again, it was quite some time before she finally returned to take our payment.   We noted that most of the tables around us had one particular waiter, and our waitress was kind of the ""odd man out"" in our section, so I'm unsure if we got there before the other guy started his shift, or if she had several tables to tend to inside and was only taking care of us when she remembered to come out front to check on us, or what the situation was. Aside from the poor service, our meals were fine - the potatoes I'd ordered were quite good and my omelet was so large I could barely finish it (this isn't surprising, considering The Cheesecake Factory is known for their gigantic portions).  If the service would've been better, they'd have probably received another star.  Total for his breakfast sandwich, my omelet, a glass of milk and a glass of OJ came to $31.43 before gratuity.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=120,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.44,3.3200000000000003

356,Thien H.,"Riverbank, CA",648,639,2941.0,2.0,2016-06-17,"Dadeland Mall's Cheesecake Factory is weak. It is especially weak when I compare it to Aventura's Cheesecake Factory. I had a pretty good experience at Aventura recently. Their happy hour foods were surprisingly good overall and it inspired me to try Dadeland's.  While the Chicken Sliders $5.50 were big and appetizing at Aventura, at Dadeland they were a joke. As you'll see from one of my photos, one chicken patty was hastily ripped in half to make two sliders. One of the chicken pieces was so small, it was basically a single bite. The Portabella, Avocado, and Zucchini fries $6.95 are extremely greasy. I couldn't continue eating them. The Guacamole $5.50 on our first visit to Dadeland was okay. The Mojito $5.50 was fine. The S'mores cheesecake $7.95 was the best dish. ______ On our second visit to Dadeland's Cheesecake Factory, the Guacamole $5.50 was very unappetizing looking. It had a very obvious brown/oxidized color to it. I thought that it was only brown on the top layer, but it was brown throughout. I dug deeper in several spots in the dish and it was all oxidized. I'm guessing they had a vat of old guacamole and made sure to send it to anyone who ordered off the happy hour menu. To top it off, I bit into the little nub of the avocado. That was unpleasant. This time we ordered it mild and it still had a bizarre spicy taste. It didn't taste like any type of chili I've tried before. It wasn't black pepper either. It tasted like it had been seasoned with pepper spray (the self -defense kind) or something. Very strange. The grossest thing we ate were the Beer Battered French Fries $6.95. Avoid this dish. It was nothing like we expected. I expected beer battered fries like those that are served with fried fish at a British pub. Instead, it was like they slow cooked the hefty potato sticks in barely warm oil first. Then they battered them with a thick and strange breading and fried it at too low of a temperature. The outside of the ""fries"" was technically crispy, but they were somehow not tasty. I usually love fried food, but the thoroughly oil-soaked fry was a huge disappointment.  I had tried the Ahi Tuna Tartare at Aventura and was looking forward to it here. The miniscule amount of tartare $7.95 was insulting. All of the tartare could fit inside one of those little plastic cups they use for ketchup. I still can't believe I just didn't send the dish back upon seeing it.  The Happy Hour Burger $5.50 was pretty basic. The only redeeming part of this particular meal was the Oreo Dream Cheesecake $7.95. At least the kitchen doesn't touch this dish. The cheesecake counter people just put a little bit of whipped cream next to it. I didn't think chain restaurants could vary so much. Dadeland Mall's location is skimpy on portions and the food is not properly cooked and/or their recipes are bad.

They sat us in the outside tables and we waited for our waiter for awhile. When the waiter finally shows he doesn't greet us with his name and only asks ""what will you have to drink"". We reply water and he just leaves without even asking if we want an appetizer and are ready to order. I'm from miami so I don't scare easily and just thought maybe he was having a rough day. I decided to be patient. The waiter proceeds to attend to both tables next to us wth a smile on his face. This goes on for about 15 minutes until he comes to take our order. We ask for bread since we're starving and again he seems in a  rush. We receive 4 breads (smallest basket ever) around 10 minutes after that and our waiter is still in a rush and doesn't even ask if we are ready to order. He again goes to serve and converse with the other two tables. At this point, both my sister and I are noticing that he definitely has an issue with us specifically. We get his attention and he reluctantly takes our order in a rush again. We barely get a word in and he seems bothered to answer our questions. He rushes off again. We waited about 45 minutes for our burgers and of course the order is wrong. During this time we didn't have any contact with the waiter ( not even to refill water). He continues to skip over us and go to the next table. We decide to leave our food untouched and just let the hostess know that we had a bad experience and would like to leave. I asked her if she needed me to pay for the bread and she said no. We left hungry and headed to Bobby's burgers which was awesome!!!. I was so disappointed because I do love cheesecake factory and have many great memories there. I don't know if he didn't want to serve us correctly because we look young and he wasn't expecting a tip or if maybe he just broke up with his girlfriend and hated women that day.

I read previous reviews and expected a long wait especially with the weekend rush, but surprisingly I got lucky and was seated almost immediately. Our waiter, David, was so friendly and patient with us throughout the evening. I ordered the Classic Burger with a side of fries (it was sooo good). My hunger was already satisfied (I stuffed my face with bread before the meal), but what's a birthday dinner without dessert? I have a peanut allergy so I'm thankful David informed us that every cheesecake has a trace of peanuts. Therefore, I decided to get a slice of Linda's Fudge cake. They decorated a birthday plate for me and sang happy birthday. I need to describe this delicious slice so you understand the awesomeness: chocolate chip frosting with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and sprinkles on the side. Need I say more?

The restaurant was clean and orderly, and the service was good. Our waiter was very attentive. We started off with some cocktails, I ordered the mule, which was awful. A good mule should have a decent amount of ginger flavoring in it, whether it be ginger puree or ginger beer. This drink barely tasted like ginger at all. It tasted like tonic water with some seltzer. I then ordered the beet and goat cheese salad. It is located under the small plates, appetizers section, and boy is it small! The amount of goat cheese given was a joke, and the beets were cut up into tiny little cubes, very disappointing. As my main plate, I had the thai wraps. This was delicious. It is fresh lettuce leaves, cabbage leaves, grilled chicken, cilantro, carrots, bean sprouts, and 3 sauces. You build your own spring roll. Very light but filling. I loved it. The chicken was flavorful, and the peanut sauce and chili sauce were so yummy.

When I arrived I was again placed on an indefinite hold. I went inside to pick up my order which was sitting on the side and getting cold. When they handed it to me they told me I could not pay because they didn't have my ticket (even though it was a very simple order to charge)-understandable.  But while waiting I looked at my order of shrimp scampi with herb crusted salmon and mashed potatoes. It was smooshed together in a big lump of mash. Horribly packed and definitely thrown around.

Way too many dishes that they seem to heighten the prices, but nothing they serve is any better than what I can quickly make at home or get at another casual dining restaurant for 2/3 the price. What sent today's visit downhill was the service. I don't expect to wait over 10 minutes for a server to come to my table, yet I did today. It was then another 10 minutes to get water at the table. Knowing how slow everything was I told the waitress the additional requests when I placed the order (mayo for a burger, parm for the pasta) yet nothing came with the food and again 10 more minutes after, so it was almost useless. Definitely not a place trying to earn my business- go elsewhere with all the options now available at Dadeland!

There were hard pieces of food stuck to almost every fork on the table and the knives had film on them. We brought it to our server's attention and the manager Linda promptly came to our table to apologize. She offered a complimentary entree or dessert, which was nice. However, the lunch experience continued to go downhill. The wait for our meals was entirely too long and the food was mediocre. My husband had the chicken teriyaki, which was dry, bland, and barely had any sauce on the chicken. For almost $17 it should be better... My chicken quesadilla was just ok.

I find that the restaurant has a lot of items and would be a great option for large groups because everybody can find something that they like in the menu. The place offers salads, appetizers, pastas, burgers, sandwiches, large plates, brunch, and any type of cheesecake concoction you can think of. I usually order the Americanah burger which has lettuce, tomato, bacon, crispy potato fries, and pink sauce. The burger comes with fries or with a salad. It's usually very good and I love it. It's huge so every time I eat it I feel very full. Sometimes we order the Vietnamese summer rolls which is a very Americanized version of this traditional dish but enjoyable enough.

370,Steve H.,"Miami, FL",1,71,,5.0,2017-04-22,"I wasn't sure whether I should give four or five stars, because The Cheesecake Factory is not perfect, but it's so much better than most local joints, I felt five stars were justified. What can I say about it? It's The Cheesecake Factory. It has about ten million dishes and fifty different cuisines, and all the recipes are excellent. They prepare everything very well. When was the last time a restaurant served you pasta al dente? The Cheesecake Factory does it. You can have Chinese. You can have Mexican. You can have Italian. Got a party of people who can't agree on what to have? Take them to The Cheesecake Factory. Everyone will be happy. The last time I went, I had the pasta with shrimp and sausage. The sauce was wonderful. Very balanced. Lots of character. They didn't skimp on the butter or cheese. The lady who grated even more cheese on the pasta wasn't a miser, either. I hate it when they give you half a teaspoon of cheese and then stare at you, like you'll tell them to stop if they embarrass you. The Cheesecake Factory doesn't play that. They bury you in cheese unless you stop them. They also served fresh bread. A nice chewy sourdough and some kind of sweet brown bread, with butter on the side. Very nice. Can't beat it.  I've eaten there many times, and I've never had food or a mixed drink that was not excellent. The down side: parking is horrible unless you want to walk, and you WILL wait for a table. That's the price you pay for consistent quality. The atmosphere could be better. The restaurant is very busy, so sometimes you really do feel like you're in a  bustling factory. If you hate huge portions, you can order lunch portions. Very helpful. The lunch pasta I ordered had over a thousand calories, which is more than enough for a sane person. My companion had the dinner-sized spaghetti and meatballs, and I could barely see him over the top of it. The cheesecake is very good. Mine is much better, but then I have to cook it, whereas The Cheesecake Factory will cook it for me and bring it to me. If you don't mind a busy setting, a wait, and a bit of noise, this place will make you very happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=40,3.48,3.21,3.216,2.548,3.318

I was not even offered a buzzer. I have never in the multiple years I have brought my family to dinner have ever experienced service this horrible. None of the hostesses wanted to tell me a timeframe they just told me to speak to the manager. The manager just repeatedly said there was nothing they can do. They tried to split our party because they did not properly start making room for a table for us. Then I spoke to her manager named Greg who acted very surprised but ALSO DID NOTHING.

The avocado toast is a baguette toasted and then cut in half with a amazing spread of mashed avocado with red onions, olive oil,  tomatoes, and basil leaves. It was a delicious appetizer and healthier then other options.

We had a couple of vegetarians and a few others that were looking for a ""low calorie"" meal so we all agreed on TCF.   Went in around 11:45 AM to avoid the lunch rush hour. Thankfully the restaurant wasn't packed so a table for 9 was available within 2 minutes.   Our server, Michael T, quickly came to our table and gracefully offered water, took our drinks order, and brought some of that delicious bread. A few minutes later we ordered some appetizers: avocado rolls, fried mac and cheese, and edamame. The three of them were fabulous. (My favorite were the avocado rolls... yummmm!!)   After debating for 30 minutes on what to eat (no kidding!), I FINALLY decided to try the bang bang shrimp and chicken with brown rice. Presentation was a plus and portion was big enough to feed 2 people. However, I was a little disappointed when I came to find out that the ""bang bang"" sauce was not the one I had in mind.

When we sat down, our server, Anthony, was amazingly attentive and such a joy to have visiting our table. He was very helpful when he realized half the table had never been here before and offered suggestions and ideas. We knew about portions but he reiterated again because we went crazy with appetizers and entrees. He was not kidding.  The food was both a hit and miss. Some of the food was good like the BangBang Shrimp, Guacamole Salad, and the Mac&Cheese burger and our appetizers (spinach dip, nachos, and deliciously amazing fried calamari). But some were misses like the tostada salad which had both the chicken breast and the tostada that were burnt and some stuff was missing a touch of seasoning. The drinks we good (need more ojito variety though).  The cheesecake of course was amazing. No complaint whatsoever on the dessert menu.

I've been to many locations around the U.S and never have had such a disappointing experience here at the Cheesecake Factory In miami, dadeland mall. First I want to say the hostess don't know what they are doing. They completely over quoted me when it wasn't even that busy and had my family and I wait over an hour and a half for a party of five adults. We finally got sat at a table which the floor around it and under it and the sliverware were completely disgusting and filthy. When our waitress arrived, we told her about the sliverware and he didn't say anything just grabbed it all and left. She came back with another set of sliverware and took our drink order. She was then gone for about 15mins while we were waiting. She came back and took our order for appetizers and we also were ready to order our main courses aswell. We ordered Nachos with chicken, Avocado egg rolls and the sweet corn tamale cakes, it took 25 mins till it finally hit the table. Our main courses hit the table 10 mins after we got our appetizers. The server didn't let us know and communicate what was even going on throughout the waiting process. On top of that all our main courses were cold. The steak my sister ordered was suppose to be medium rare and it was well done. She had to wait an extra almost 20 mins for another steak to be prepared. The manager Linda wasn't helpful at all so we asked for another manager because she had such attitude. Dora stopped by the table and was completely careless and said sorry, offered a cheesecake at the end but it was never granted to us. The servers in the restaurant just hangout around the computers talking and on their phones and neglecting guest around them including our server. My family and I couldn't be more disappointed. We ended up paying full price for everything when it all was a complete disaster. This place will go down hill just like coconut grove did. The most disappointing thing was the service.

351,Daniel D.,"Miami, FL",4,11,59.0,3.0,2017-08-07,"To start off right, I came here because of a gift card to burn. When asked for a table, they sat us outside of the restaurant but inside of the mall (literally outside of the doors of the restaurant in a gated area less than 20 feet from a kiosk with crowds walking by). I asked to be moved and they accommodated me.  I ordered the steak that came with two sides, breaded green beans and mashed potatoes and requested that the mashed potatoes be subbed with roasted broccoli. The person with me got their food before me and the server brought out the steak 10 minutes later with the ""breaded side"". We're talking 5 pieces of 1"" long green beans and a big empty space to the side. I waited another 10 minutes for the broccoli that looked like it was boiled and thrown in the oven with extra heat to make it roast quicker and was dry and tasteless on top and soggy and soft on the bottom. I asked the server to try another side and went with asparagus.  During this time, a manager came out and asked if we wanted them to take the steak back to keep warm while they prepared the asparagus. By this time, my friend had started his meal. When I asked about the side of green beans, he said that's exactly the portion they give and apologized for the empty space on the plate because since I ""asked for a substitution,"" they had to plate it separately. He was right. But why on Earth would you bring a half completed meal to the table? He acknowledged that was their mistake and offered me dessert to which I declined (damn you KetoDiet!). Eventually the asparagus came out and I had started eating the steak and had finished my gerbil sized portion of green beans (by this point people around had arrived after us and left already). I commend the manager for trying to make it right but not for low key blaming the wait on my request for a substitution.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=20,2.64,3.08,3.112,2.54,2.9040000000000004

I went to lunch today with my family and we decided to come here. We were seated right away which was surprising for a Saturday on a long weekend.  Our waiter Jonathan came to introduce himself and take our drink orders with bread in hand ( which was great). Once we ordered or drinks it took him a good 10 minutes to come back with them. Mind you, we ordered waters and coca cola's, nothing fancy that had to be made at the bar.  When he finally came to drop off the drinks we ordered our food. I ordered the same thing I got one week ago- the Louisiana Chicken Pasta but instead of the sauce the pasta comes with and the veggies I wanted a white sauce (I cannot tell you how many times, in the history of my existence I have ordered this- but since cheesecake used to be my all time favorite restaurant let's just say A LOT). I'm not sure if Jonathan was new but he seemed quite confused with my order. We asked him to bring more bread as well.  20 more minutes passed and our drinks were empty and watered down and had just then received the extra bread we had asked for. After 20 more minutes of waiting (still with empty drinks) he finally returned to the table to ask if it was okay with me that the pasta had Cajun butter on it (which is normal to the Louisiana Chicken Pasta dish), which makes the dish spicy, after I had clearly stated I ONLY wanted white sauce. No veggies, not the sauce that it usually comes with, white sauce... Obviously this was not okay with me. He returned to nowhere land or wherever it was that he kept hiding out for about another 20 minutes. We were all starving at this point and had been here for an hour already...He finally started bringing out the dishes 2 at a time. Of course everyone else got there food before I did. And when my dish finally came it wasn't even Jonathan that brought it out! He had someone else bring my dish for me (even though he had brought everyone else's out and we were 5...)

Anyway, he finally fixed the check for us and explained that our waiter had been in a fist fight with another employee over a female staff member. All in all we probably spent an additional hour waiting for them to fix their error. It was astounding to me that the manager would let the employees behave in this manner. The kitchen crew was unbearable. They were singing and dancing and yelling and the manager was standing right there. He had no control over his employees at all. I will never go back to this Cheesecake Factory!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=40,2.52,2.93,3.064,,2.766

346,Maria D.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,13,6.0,3.0,2017-12-02,"I've been to The Cheesecake Factory many times but this was my first time at this location. My friend and I went for lunch. We were seated the the patio area. There seemed to be a shortage of servers, as our server was barely attentive. We ordered a salad to spilt and an appetizer. We asked for lemon for our water, bread for the table and plates so share our salad. The app and the salad come out pretty quick but we had to wait to eat since we didn't have plates. We had to ask the server a few times to give us plates. The bread and lemon wedges came way after the food. I love the food there but the service was not impressive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami,2.68,2.87,3.068,,2.7940000000000005
344,Jonathan C.,"San Antonio, TX",0,19,35.0,2.0,2017-12-11,"Hi, the waiter didn't ask why our plates were barely halfway finished. I asked for two drinks to save time. I actually had to ask a passing waiter to get a refill. It didn't even seem that busy considering multiple tables were open around us during lunch. I have been here before, albeit a couple years ago, and wanted to give it another shot as last time the food (normal) didn't justify the cost/experience. It'll be my wife's choice if we go back.

328,Brandon L.,"Miami, FL",63,165,152.0,3.0,2018-01-08,"I have a love/ hate thing with this restaurant.  I think things have drastically changed with this chain over the years and has gotten to big to keep consistency. One of the main problems is they make way to many items to keep up with quality and consistency. The menu is like a mini novel. You can literally spend 20-30 mins looking through it and wonder what page to reference of the other thing you thought about getting. That being said, it's nice when you go with a group that wants a wide range of types of foods. As for the food, there are thing I really enjoy. I can't say I've ever had anything bad, just lack of overall consistency. My favorite, which is not on the menu anymore is the Portobello on a bun. They will actually make it most of the time if you ask.  It's kind of a sin to go here and not have Cheesecake... I have noticed the size of the slices have gotten smaller (back to my consistency argument). One a good note the taste has remained the same.  The staff is always friendly, but they seam to be running around a lot. Long waits unless you sit by the bar. That area is first come first serve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami,2.88,2.82,3.068,,2.844
