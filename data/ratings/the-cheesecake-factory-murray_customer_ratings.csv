After about a 15 minute wait, and almost falling during the walk to the table lol (very slippery floors and I was wearing heels) we were seated. I forgot this place had such a huge menu with different types of cuisine, but I didn't want to go through it all so my boyfriend and I just ordered a flatbread app and the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic to share. The flatbread was okay. The pasta would have been delicious if it weren't for the overpowering saltiness. We also ordered the classic cheesecake with cherries which was the highlight of the meal, but not awesome enough to want to come back here for another couple of years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray?start=200,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.504,3.1600000000000006

We finally gave up waiting and turned our wives loose on finding us a bar table. Our server was great but the food did not make up for the incredibly long wait.  That being said if you end up there and have persevered try the hummus and pita appetizer it was the best thing we ordered. The shrimp tacos off the skinnylicious menu were good, the tuscan chicken was tasty but nothing made up for the long wait in a crowded foyer.

The wait is always ridiculous, no matter what time of day or night you go. The decor is tacky- what is it even supposed to be emulating? The music is way, WAY too loud, making the noise level unbearable. You can't even have a conversation with your dinner companions without shouting. The menu is huge- it's in a spiral bound book peppered with advertisements. Am I the only person who thinks it's odd to sell ad space in a menu? As I was saying, the restaurant has an extensive menu and the food is pretty okay, but it's over-priced. The cheesecake is good- some are pretty over the top, some are more traditional and simple.

306,Hola M.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,1,,2.0,2012-04-23,"I've had prior experiences with parties for 2-4 without reservations and been sat within 30 minutes without any problems. However, we had a large group this past Saturday and had made reservations for our party of 18. We called three hours prior to our arrival time and added 4 people to our original party so 22. They said that it would be an hour longer wait time. We said fine and told everyone we would be sat at 7:30 PM instead of 6:30 PM. We all arrived by 7:00 PM. We did not get sat down until 9:00 PM, despite our reservation and confirmation!! Worst service, they did not apologize, they did not offer any explanation, just said that the other party prior to us had not left yet, then what would they have done had we had our original plan. The food is good, the cheesecake is okay. The service at the host stand is awful. The ladies look like they would rather be somewhere else. They are not helpful.  So, the moral is, if you have a 2-4 top, you'll be fine, but don't EVER plan a family or work celebration because they are not equipped to handle it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray?start=300,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.408,3.0400000000000005

177,Andrew S.,"Riverton, UT",160,382,102.0,3.0,2012-12-01,"You have to admire any chain restaurant that will outright admit to being a factory that mass produces food items.  Sure, we know this is the case with all chains, but heck I'm going to give them a pass on this and one other factor - they do really have cheesecake (as is also suggested in their name) and plenty of it! I've been to the Cheesecake Factory maybe 3 times.  And it has always been okay, but not really anywhere I can say I am likely to actually choose to go of my own volition, I've only really been for group or family events.  In fact my criteria for going is simple: 1. Someone else is paying. 2. I can get a couple of bites of cheesecake mixed into my dining experience. 3. (And most important) - If it prevents any chance of having to visit the Olive Garden I'll throw all other criteria straight out of the window. So with the stage now set, I can say that today's visit really was not too bad.  What I do know about this chain is the portions are HUGE, so I generally order the 'lunch' items, which are more moderate portions if your definition of that is a medium sized banquet.  And of those, the meat loaf is the best one in my experience, it is actually pretty darn good and ultimately why they get 3 stars here.  Fish and Chips is definitely somewhat MEH - so avoid if that's the fix you are looking for! I also must say, I'm a fan of Cheesecake, however deserts in general are also a fan of my waste line so I try to avoid as much as possible.  But the ones I've tried here, particularly the seasonal and specialty ones do hit the spot.  Peppermint candy cheesecake anyone?  Yummy.  Lot better than it sounds! Service was very friendly, and overall prompt considering how busy it was, certainly nothing too much to complain about here.  The overall ambiance is also pretty good - if I have one complaint - it's that the music can be a little too loud and overwhelming at times.  I'm not however going to take a star for that, I tend to be a bit of an audiophile, and I think that, combined with age is making me somewhat sensitive about what I tend to consider 'irritating' background noise.  For the younger crowd it could be great. If you've never been, definitely give it a try.  Just beware of those portions if you're on any type of diet (and I suspect, not just portions, but all the other food pyramid busting goodness lovingly cooked in at the factory!!!!).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray?start=160,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.732,2.96

I went in on a Monday afternoon, 20 minute wait. It took 15-20 minutes for the waitress to even notice my mom and I to ask us what we would like to drink. When we told her we needed an extra minute to decide what to eat, she took 20 more minutes to come back and check if we were ready to order. I ended up getting the Teriyaki Chicken, it's my fave. It took 30 minutes for our food to come out. I started eating and couldn't help but notice that the rice was rock hard, the chicken tasted off, and there was hardly any sauce. It honestly tasted like it had been sitting around for a while. The restaurant was just really unorganized and nothing was going right. The couple next to us waited 45 minutes for their food. In their defense, the manager came over and offered to take my meal off the check. Overall, my mom and I spent 2 hours here.

I had some of it and it was quite good. Pretty basic, pounded chicken with pasta and I think Romano sause. It was good.  But what I got totally blew it out of the water!  If you like salmon, then prepare yourself for the beat salmon you'll ever have. Its called salmon genovese. Amazing, that is what it should be called. The salmon was grilled with roasted tomatoes and artichokes, anyway it was plated beautifully and the service was great. Now my wife and I arrived before 5:00, so obviously our wait time was long enough for them to grab menus, and our service was above average, and we didn't wait too long for food, which tasted amazing. Low wait time + Service + Food quality ++ Why? Probably because my unborn child inside my wife was screaming for food at 4:00 in the afternoon. If we had gotten there at 5:30 or later, I would expect a longer wait time, less service quality, and possibly lower food quality.

You're probably curious as to why I rated it as less than satisfactory, it is the lack of a digital presence in this ever growing digital age. Most restaurants of this calibre have advanced to the point that they accept digital reservations through services such as OpenTable, not The Cheesecake Factory. Most provide free wireless Internet for those of us that prefer to do business while dining, not The Cheesecake Factory.  This may not seem significant to most, but in time, it will be the determining factor in the overall success of a business, especially with the launch of services such as Apple Pay and Google Wallet as they innovate the convenience of payment. Apple Pay is my default form of payment due to its ease of use and security features, The Cheesecake Factory is the only premium restaurant in Salt Lake that lacks progression, this is why I limit my rating to three stars.

This happens about 4 times a year. I have never had a bad server, they are always professional waitstaff. I assume this is because of the average price per plate.  This last time we ordered off the Sunday brunch menu and I had a fabulous crab hash and my husband had a sinful French toast sammich of doom.  Of course both were amazing. I was a little annoyed by some burned peppers in the hash but it was overcome by yummy poached eggs and real chunks of crab.  The decor is dated and very Las Vegas but who really cares as long as it's clean and the food is good?  One beef I have is the community seating. I HATE the long bench and the tiny tables spaced out by a foot.

I admire their consistency in taste- they have great quality control. Nothing here will taste bad and you will have the exact same dining experience every time you eat here. Unfortunately, this means that it will be very loud and noisy, and service will be super slow. There's a reason why their menu is 20,000 pages long- to give you something to read while you wait, and wait.  And wait. Sitting in the bar, or going here super late at night will earn you no reprieve- you have slow service even after 9 pm.   To be fair, no one seems to notice the slow service much. Parties are raucous and boisterous and having a good time. Lots of parties of women celebrating impending nuptials, or birthdays. But if you are desperate, I suggest you order a bunch of appetizers. They come out a tad faster, and no matter which appetizer you order, the quality will be good and the taste will be fine.  I suggest this place for large parties with a lot of time to kill. The extensive menu will guarantee something for everyone, and you won't notice the wait if you have lots of news to shout about across the table. If you're still sober at the end of the night, I recommend examining the decor.

You had seven hours and literally only one job where this order was concerned, but lo and behold when we arrived at 7pm, that cake had never ever been pulled and our order ticket had been lost in the shuffle.

But yesterday night, my husband suggested we go there, and I thought it would be a nice change from Olive Garden or McGrath's, where we normally go. They were a bit disorganized with seating people. Rather than using a paging system, the host and hostesses would yell out the name and number of people in a party. They heard me wrong when I gave our last name and said party of three. They were calling our name, but for two, and it took a few extra minutes for them to sort that out. The host was apologetic and friendly, though. It wasn't a big deal, but having worked in a restaurant before, I know that something like that would probably set off a different type of personality and the restaurant workers would get yelled at. Our waitress was Jen, and while she was nice enough, I'm fairly good at reading people. She seemed annoyed, and I'm not sure if it was with us or if she just didn't want to be there at all that night. We all have those days, I know. I ordered the fish and chips with the sweet potato fries and she gave me a ""you're kinda stupid"" look when I asked if there was any other sauce besides ketchup for the sweet potato fries. My options were ketchup and fry sauce. I asked for fry sauce, but I wonder if there are other sauces she could have recommended. Most places have something sweet to go with it, or something with a kick. Either one of those would have complemented the fries better. When it came time to get the check, she gave us another table's check that didn't even closely resemble what we'd ordered. When she dropped the check, that was pretty much the only time we got a huge smile out of her, as well as a ""it was my pleasure serving you tonight"" (which, sorry to say, didn't feel genuine at all.) I had to catch her while she was walking by, or it might have taken us another fifteen to twenty minutes to get the correct check. She wasn't apologetic about giving us the wrong check, and didn't even seem surprised that she had.  I'm sure I'll eat here again, but I'm a bit put off by how pushy the servers are with cheesecake--if you don't want to eat it there, then they try to push you to order it to go--and the lukewarm service we received from the server. I also wish she'd been thoughtful enough to include a container of tartar sauce for my leftover fish and chips.

162,D. W.,"Salt Lake City, UT",798,1410,,3.0,2015-04-26,"Salt Lake City has grown up a lot, in a culinary sense and nowhere is this more in abundance than this chain electing to finally land in this market. The city, in addition to badly needing an enema, also needs more upscale chains like this. The interior was nearly spot-on to a lot of the East coast locations I've hit up and the only flaw I could find was the black coating peeling back on every one of the benches. Despite it being jammed, this location was also the least amount of time I've ever waited to be seated at any of their restaurants. It's overall borderline artsy and tasteful and apropos for the lofty pretensions this chain has for itself. This is a very good representative restaurant of that, overall.  This extends to the food itself. Tons of alcoholic drinks on the menu and their annoying habit of including the Sunday-only stuff in the regular menu, but refusing to make any of it, unless you happen to be there on that day. That menu is extensive, but mostly a hodge-podge of standard Americana stuff, along with a bevy of questionable fusion ideas executed mostly poorly. The hallmark of this chain, to me, is that everything, including the cheesecake, is one note off. This extends to the Coke Zero mix, to the soy ginger, remoulade, Thai peanut and Dynamite mayo sauce, to the ""tempura"" batter on the shrimp and on down. The warm bread basket was nice and the bread was flavorful. This, along with the perfectly done fries, was probably the best part of the entire thing. The shrimp batter tasted slightly off and refused to go nicely with any of those 4 sauces I mentioned. The Cuban rolls was an intriguing idea; combining a Cubano into a spring roll. In execution, though, it's basically like they stuck everything in to a blender, stuffed it into a rice wrapper and fried it to death. This also refused to go with sauces, but the idea of a Cubano, when done well, is that it wouldn't need to. In case it's not clear, this was not done well. The mango key lime cheesecake was another disaster. Topped with artificial sugar whip, gloppy mango syrup, incredibly overdone key lime flavoring and next to no actual cheesecake taste, then mounted on a crust with bits of coconut that was itself a dense, overly thick chunky mess, it nearly defied eating. In fact, I bailed on it well before the end. This is a place I meant to get to since it opened and while it took longer than expected for the stars to align both with me having opportunity and the lines dying down, I finally made it and now it's done, probably never to be repeated again. Given that it will typically be busy (wait line was out the door when we left), know going in this place will be rather loud and service will be very put upon and performance will drop accordingly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray?start=160,3.12,3.13,3.13,2.8600000000000003,3.126

Even though their cheesecakes are wonderful their food here also if very good. The only problem with this place is that during the weekend the wait time is super long ESP if you have a large party of 6 or more.  Their food menu has a little bit of everything. They go from asian to southern food. I would recommend the gumbo or the mediera chicken. Those in my opinion are the best. This time I thought I would switch it up a bit and got the lemon herb chicken. It was good, and very flavorful, the only problem with it is that the lemon flavor over powers everything on it. Even my carrots and mash potatoes started to taste like lemon after a while. **disclaimer** the portion size here is huge...so if you are not a big eater and want dessert I would recommend eating half on your plate and then order cheesecake.

The bread, quesadilla, salad wraps and tiramisu cheesecake were good. The Tuscan Chicken, however, was beautifully described on the menu, but turned out to be dreadfully horrendous with too much sauce. I love sweet potato fries, but there was too much seasoning. After the meal, I realized how much MSG was in the food. I drank so much water throughout the meal, but I am dehydrated now. The non-stop atmospheric noise is a headache.

Heck, I even wanted to give The Chef a hug.   The chicken was tender and juicy. The cajun spices were spicy enough to add zing to my taste buds without overdoing it. Ok spicy is not actually a taste but a form of pain, which then confirms when people say there is always pleasure in a little bit of pain. The pasta was done in perfection. The shrimp was tasty and together with blends of vegetables (onions, tomatoes and green peppers with parsley sprinkles), they complete this whole heavenly dish.  I would give a 5-stars review if I had not made to wait over an hour to get our table on that Saturday evening. I know that is the busiest time of the week, and I don't mind the wait but we had to wait almost 20 minutes to get the bread served (and another 20 minutes to get our orders).  At least, they should serve the bread right away after we were seated since everybody was surely starving after all that long wait.

It just seems to be one of those places that fits any ""special"" occasion, whether it be a birthday, graduation, or a family reunion. In addition to its eclectic decor and snappily dressed staff, the restaurant's menu boasts more items than a Vegas buffet with a smorgasbord of dessert choices (not limited to cheesecake). This time we went for my wife's birthday and there were 7 of us in tow. I am always anxious about going to restaurants in large groups as I tend to be the one on top of things who knows what he wants and knows that the sooner everyone orders, the sooner everyone is feasting. My sentiments do not seem to be universally (or even commonly) acknowledged, yet the staff at The Cheesecake Factory was helpful, patient, and responsive. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce. It was delicious but no better than what you'd expect at a sit-down restaurant. My wife had the salmon spring rolls and shrimp summer spring rolls. She initially ordered the ahi tartare (all of these items are on the Skinnylicious menu), but they were out of tuna. Odd for 4 pm on a Wednesday, but she decided on the rolls instead. She loved both of them. The rest of the orders were similarly enjoyed (eggplant Parmesan [huge!], margarita pizza, herb-crusted salmon, steak medallions, and chicken bellagio). We also ordered seven slices of various cheesecakes, and there were no complaints there. The lovely waitress was cordial, quick with the drink and bread refills, and helpful to the finish.

While waiting for food I had a hibiscus lemonade that was actually really good. It was $5, but with unlimited refills and the option to switch it for raspberry or strawberry I found it worth it. The food eventually made its way out and I began the meal. The burger was okay, but I've had much better Mac & Cheese Burgers for less money and less of a wait.

The lemonade passed, I'll let the burger slip by with a pass, but the fries...the fries...the first thought when eating them was wonder at how old they must have been. I ate a few, from the top, then the middle, and then the bottom, all in hopes that I could find one worth eating. I never found one.  Eventually I offered fries to friends just to see what their thoughts were.

We paid for our $44 meal, only to find out that they lost our gift card before they ran it, leaving our meal unpaid for. We sat for an hour and a half, waiting for some action to be taken. Finally, the manager said that she was sorry they lost our $100 gift card, and ""we would just have to take our losses."" After we explained that we thought that was very unacceptable that they weren't willing to replace what was left on our gift card, she said the best she could do was give us a $25 gift card, and it would come out of our waiters pocket.  Wow. Just wow. Our waiter looked tirelessly for our gift card, and was stellar at taking care of us. I find it awful that a SENIOR manager would ever be so unwilling to replace our gift cards, and then later say she would do it at the expense of her own employee!!  After some discussion, she gave my husband the $25 gift card, and he called to see the balance of the card. It was zero-- in fact she had never even activated card, which the employee on the phone told us must happen in order to add money on the card. So not only this SENIOR MANAGER refuse to replace our gift cards initially, and later said she would give us $25 after losing $100, but she never even put money of the gift card!!  I'm extremely disappointed in the management and cannot believe that they would treat customers like that.

We sat in the dark for about 45 minutes before our waitress came up and told us that our food wasn't going to be able to be made. I don't know why it took so long for them to tell us. Because by the time they came out and finally told us, all other restaurants were closed and we couldn't have dinner anywhere. To top it off instead of comping our future meal to come back another time to compensate for what happened, they told us that if we wanted to, we could BUY some cheesecake! I asked to speak with the manager and our waitress went to get her. She never came. So I asked the person at the front desk to speak with the manager and they said that the general manager of both stores was there and asked if I wanted to speak with her, I said enthusiastically yes that would be even better.

I dont know why this location is so popular/crowded. just the fact that its connected to a busy mall? It's a huge chain? Other locations are fine but I dont see how such a dirty place with terrible service, neglectful and avoidant staff can have so much business!   EVERY time we've gone they seat us at a table with bits of food on the chairs and table (pet peeve). Time before last I stepped in a pile of rice on the floor. The time before that a glass was dropped and broken by a server, she asked a busy busser to take care of it but he didnt even hear her cause he was soooo busy! When she came back to the area and saw it still hadn't been cleaned up she just threw a napkin on top of the broken glass and liquid, walked away and started giggling with a coworker in the back corner. These shards of glass were on the ground for almost our entire meal. I was actually concerned about a toddler who was running back and forth by all the glass, but no one else seemed to notice or care.  They have no problem serving with dirty glassware and silverware. I am always so surprised by how terrible the service and quality of food is, especially since the place is often packed and ridiculously overpriced for the quality of food. They seem to have an abundance of staff but they rarely want to go to their tables. I have watched with my own eyes as servers hurriedly walk back and forth up and down and looked extremely busy, but they weren't doing anything! They were seemingly powerwalking to random corners of the restaurant, shuffling around some glasses or just standing at card readers then they'd rush to another side for some more shuffling and the illusion of being too busy to wait on their table.  Finally, the last time my guy made me go he ordered one of his favorite entrees (chicken and biscuits...that dish is WHY he wants to eat here) When his entree arrived and he tried to put his fork into the biscuits they were so hard that one biscuit repelled the fork, flew off the plate and sounded like a rock when it landed! He waited for our server to come back, he just wanted to replace the biscuit but after about ten minutes he resigned to not having any biscuits. She NEVER came back to check our food, refill our glasses or do her job at all until she decided we needed our check. We showed her the biscuit and she blew it off like, how was I supposed to know? It was completely inedible, like fossilized dinodroppings. She asked if he wanted another, he said he didnt want to risk it and he was done with his chicken, he said he would have taken one earlier but she never came back. I requested for her to bring some biscuits anyway. A few minutes later someone else with crazy person  makeup came with biscuits and said she heard about the rock biscuit and hoped it didn't happen again. She didn't offer any compensation. In everyone's opinion, if you have to pay nearly twenty dollars for everything on the menu then the food should be at least edible, period. Quality control is not an unattainable mystery.

The restaurant wasn't particularly crowded today, besides that they can handle huge crowds at cheesecake factory.  So here are my observations: 1.  Service was slow. It took an unusually long time before we got our main course and again a long time before we got our dessert. It even took a long time to get the bill. 2.  They were out of the desert we ordered, they offered substitutions, we accepted a substitution; however, they made no concessions in terms of a discount on our dessert or on our meal. 3.  At The server's suggestion, we ordered the dinner special and found the portion to be much smaller than the usual main course portions. As I've mentioned in prior reviews, their portions are typically big enough for two people to split.

159,Chloe H.,"Lebanon, OH",183,16,2.0,3.0,2016-02-15,"Being President's Day, we decided to get there early, and we were glad we did! For a party of two our wait was still an hour, but we expected this to be the case. Luckily the mall attached has some great stores. Our waiter was great, extremely friendly and accommodating. After perusing the 50 page spiral-bound menu, we finally made our decisions. About half an hour after we ordered, the complementary bread came. Long wait, but at least the bread was warm. Shortly after we received our appetizer - the factory nachos. Holy massive plate of food batman! Unfortunately, the chips were grease-laden....literally dripping in oil, and the cheese was hard and coagulated, and also incredibly greasy. On the bright side, the guacamole tasted fresh and the pico de gallo was pleasant. Four chips in and we were already full. When our entrees finally came, the California Guacamole Superfood Salad had to be sent back because the order was incorrect, but the waiter was accommodating and friendly about it. Once the right salad came, overall I didn't have any complaints. It wasn't anything that would wow you, but at least it was fresh. My husband ordered the Factory Burrito, I believe it was called. It was literally 14 inches long and 5 inches wide, so he of course was initially thrilled at how much food there was. However, the burrito ended up being a soggy mess of a tortilla smothered in tepid red sauce and wrapped around a massive, mushy mound of flavored rice. Unfortunate. I will say though, both of us agreed that the endless lemonade was fantastic. It's too bad they changed their policy and don't let you change flavors once you order.  When we asked for our check, the waiter looked sad and asked if everything was alright, looking and the vast array of food still left on our plates. Of course we told him it was okay, we were just full. Since we were paying with gift cards, we weren't about to complain about leaving with full stomachs and wallets. We also got some Oreo cheesecake to go.  Overall, it was your typical chain restaurant experience.

Pros: Large portions, amazing cheesecake and clean restrooms. Cons: High prices, bad service and long wait times. I am a huge fan of the cheesecake factory chains. Mostly because of the red velvet cheesecake. We arrived this evening around 10 pm (one of the few choices open at 10 pm for a full service meal). There was a 10 minute wait (which we found odd since it was 10 pm and there was no one in the lobby). Once we were seated, we waited 15 min to place our drink order. Our waiter ""forgot"" to bring out bread until after our appetizer was delivered to our table.  We ordered: Pot stickers: Piping hot, crispy and seasoned to perfection! The sauce was addicting! I kept dipping my bread in the sauce. I would definitely order this again. The only con- they only give you 6 small dumplings. So, for the price of $10.95....you are paying for quality not quantity.  Chicken Madeira: This dish was so disappointing! Ice cold, lacking in flavor, gluey cheese and overcooked asparagus!  Disclaimer: We have ordered this dish before at another location and it was wonderful.  We complained to our waiter and expressed our concerns about the dish. He acted annoyed and told us he would get a manager and have it remade. The manager brought out the remake and seemed annoyed with us. She did not even apologize for the mistake. If you are going to pay $18+ for chicken, it should at least be hot! The new one had been microwaved for a few minutes (rubbery!). We basically filled up on bread and pot stickers and took our dessert to go.  BTW: We paid full price for everything, even though they took 25 minutes to replace a messed up item.  Lemon raspberry cheesecake: Out of all of the desserts I have tried at cheesecake factory, this one is by far the sweetest (tastes like pure sugar). I would not get this item again.  Craigs crazy carrot cake cheesecake: Very tasty and not too sweet! This carrot cake had a subtle sweetness and was moist!  Overall I wouldn't come back to this location.

We added shrimp ($5 extra and they gave us probably 6 small, measly shrimp.) Next time just add chicken. It's cheaper. The noodles are spaghetti, but next time I'd change it for angel hair. The thick noodle seemed odd without a marinara sauce. The garlic sauce is light and buttery. The dish was reminiscent of buttered noodles my mom would make me as a kid.

Best thing ever. I have no words. I had the Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Cheesecake, would definitely recommend.  My only gripe is the service.

I just stopped by for a late lunch today and everything just seemed to be a little ""off."" First, it was close to 2 pm and there were two dozen customers just hanging out in the lobby waiting to be seated in the nearly empty restaurant. Never a good sign. I promptly approached the hostess stand and the hostess was very short tempered and actually quite rude when asking, exasperated and with a loud sigh, ""how many?"" I told her two, and she literally snapped back ""give me 10 minutes okay?"" Um, wow, if you are having such a bad day, maybe you need to go take a little break and chill out. That's a surefire way to run off customers.  We were seated and finally approached by our server, and she too seemed to be really annoyed like she really, REALLY hated her job. She wasn't even remotely pleasant. I've rarely had servers that are so unhappy and unpleasant; it was so noticeable that we almost got up to leave, but we were so hungry (and I was craving avocado egg rolls) so we opted to stay.  The appetizer was good, but was haphazardly flung on our table by some other waiter. When our lunches arrived almost 20 minutes later, the plates were messy and carelessly thrown together. Talk about unappetizing. A kitchen should always take great pride in presenting a pretty dish, but both of our plates were as sloppy as they come. I had asked for sauteed spinach instead of mashed potatoes with my herb crusted chicken dish, and I was served a handful of RAW spinach just slapped on my plate! What? I had to ask for sauteed spinach and of course our waitress was annoyed but come on, RAW spinach? The vegetables were all poorly cooked, from my minuscule portion of green beans to my husband's barely steamed asparagus. I think the cooks on duty need to be trained on how to properly prepare veggies, stat! Even worse, my chicken was SO rubbery, to the point where I had to get a steak knife just to cut it and I nearly wore out my jaw trying to chew it. I am not exaggerating. I know I should've sent it back to the kitchen but at this point I was just so hungry and wanted to be done with this disappointing meal.  I never, ever complain about dining experiences but I feel like folks need to be aware of the problems at this location. Maybe corporate will take notice?

My wife is a fan of their chicken piccata. I know it's a simple dish but they do a really good job with the lemon sauce with capers. I like their kobe burger and the smoke house BBQ burger but I normally go with their lunch pizza (margarita) and salad. I have tried a lot from their menu by try to save room for a cheesecake. I haven't had a bad cheesecake yet or one that I wouldn't order again. Tonight we came in for desert and have their newly updated recipe for carrot cake and I got the Dutch apple caramel streusel. Wow, both were really good. The service has always been great here and Holly tonight was no exception, she did great. And that goes for any Cheesecake Factory that I have ever gone to, the service makes or breaks the dinning experience . The only reason I am give them three stars is for the fact that this has to be one of the smallest and loudest of their restaurants that I have been to.

I wanted to leave a review though where I could remember my whole experience. So first off Saturday night super busy. So we try to plan to go little early like 5pm maybe the wait will be less. Nope still a 55 minute -75 minute wait. So we put our names down and wait. Get a booth seat which is nice and look over the menu.  Looked over the menu for a long long time before we were helped by our waitress. I've come to the conclusion too it's not there fault. There understaffed. They need more waitresses and waiters to turn tables over quicker. So the wait would always be less for those wanting to eat and they could make more money... just saying.  Anyway she takes are full order because we are beyond hungry and ready. Avocado Egg Rolls for appetizer, I got the Thai Lettuce Wraps as my entree, and my husband got the Enchiladas. Ended with a banana cream cheesecake to share.  So Avocado Egg Rolls! A+ they were amazing and actually like the highlight of my meal. My Thai Lettuce wraps were decently good too. My husband said his Enchiladas were good but not as good as a Mexican restaurant of course. He said the rice was terrible no flavor. The Avocado Egg Rolls $12 pretty pricy for a appetizer but possibly worth it in my opinion. Thai Lettuce wraps $15? Eh I've had better for cheaper. My husbands $15 Enchiladas. Also had better for cheaper.  Cheesecake worth it and yummy!  My conclusion is this... this place is lacking in service and needs some help with that to get people in and out the door quicker. Next is the quality of food vs the price isn't matching depending on the items. So overall experience is probably would only come back if someone I knew really really wanted to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray,2.84,3.15,3.1,,3.026

36,Nicole C.,"Salt Lake City, UT",1,16,76.0,4.0,2017-11-07,"If you're looking for a place to satisfy a number of different tastes, Cheesecake Factory is the place. They have a vast menu that hits anything you could possibly be in the mood for. The Chicken Waffle Benedict is fabulous for brunch. The syrup for the waffle tastes like buttery toffee, it's incredible. I enjoy the Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls are fresh and full of flavor. I really enjoy the Fried Macaroni and Cheese, it's the perfect consistency of cheesy goodness with a light panko coating. You can definitely feast on appetizers here. As far as entrees go, you can't go wrong with the Miso Salmon or Chicken Picatta. My sweetheart loves the Cuban Sandwich and he gets it with Sweet Potato Fries. His favorite dessert is Linda's Fudge Cake. I've tried a number of the cheesecake selections and am doing my best to try them all though the Key Lime Cheesecake is one of my absolute favorites and the Pumpkin Cheesecake is my favorite during the holidays. Give Cheesecake Factory a try, you won't be disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray?start=20,2.72,3.1,3.092,,2.9480000000000004

The cheesecake and staff is the best part about this restaurant. The staff is friendly and always doing their best. The cheesecake is also amazing. If you go here, go for the cheesecake.   The atmosphere is not the best. It is way to dark and way to loud. I can't even have a conversation with the person across from me. The lighting is way to dark. I had to use a flashlight to just read the menu. It's not efficient to have the customers struggle to read the menu.  I don't think I will be returning.

2,Lee B.,"South Jordan, UT",198,79,347.0,4.0,2017-11-30,"Ok, so I have been going to the The Cheesecake Factory since I can remember. Growing up near several in Southern California gave me the opportunity to watch the restaurant grow and evolve. This Cheesecake is a great example of what it has become.  While the wait always seems to be long at this location, the staff is pretty welcoming and there is a good of space to sit inside, or you can wonder over to Z Gallery (another review coming). I love how the indoor seating has a nicely located cheesecake display, giving you the opportunity to decide what cake you want, before you indulge in bread and giant sized portions.  The restaurants design is very similar to most other Cheesecakes I have been in, with the exception of the bar area (that's a whole other story though). The seating comfortable and spread out. Tables are large, as they have to be for the ginormous plates.  Service is very structure and always seems to be by the book. I am always impressed with the team work atmosphere of the staff. You never feel like you are being ignored.  The food is always pretty consistent. I have never had an item that deviated greatly from the norm. While it is not exceptional, it is always good. The menu offer more then enough options to satisfy a small army, let alone your family.  The Cheesecake Factory has changed over the years, but it seems to have found its place and is staying there for the time being. If you want a lot choices and big portions, and willing to wait for a table, you have found your place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray,2.96,3.12,3.12,,3.0560000000000005

0,McKenzie B.,"Provo, UT",129,116,129.0,5.0,2017-12-15,"Here's the deal... The Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant and although I typically try to stick to smaller, local joints, I LOVE eating here. It's just a classic chain choice. The menu options can be overwhelming but if you know what to get ahead of time, you won't be disappointed. That's why I'm here to tell you what to get! The avocado egg rolls are a MUST when it comes to appetizers and I love the Thai lettuce wraps as a meal (even though they are listed as an appetizer). The orange chicken is also a hit but make sure you ask for extra sauce since the chicken can sometimes be a little dry. If you're wanting something heavier, the Louisiana Chicken Pasta is also delicious if you are wanting something heavier.  The pros: HUGE portions, warm bread before your meal, lots of items to choose from and TONS of yummy dessert options, duh! The cons: dark, loud, and the menu options can be overwhelming, a little pricier than other chain restaurants. And most importantly, you can't go wrong with any of their cheesecake flavors (especially any peanut butter / chocolate combo).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray,3.16,3.18,3.14,,3.1720000000000006

She was punctual and made sure everything was going well.  At the end of the dinner she took my husband's credit card and disappeared for several minutes.  Apparently she set it down and left it somewhere, her manager picked it up.  Needless to say that was uncomfortable but, it all worked out.  We will be watching our credit card closely for fraudulent transactions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray?start=20,3.04,3.15,3.136,,3.106
1,Kyle C.,"South Jordan, UT",1,11,,3.0,2017-12-28,"I have mixed feelings about this place. I enjoy it for what it is, but sometimes I really don't have the best experience when I try new things. I learned to stop trying different menu items and just stick with the three cheese pasta, or the spaghetti and meatballs. Those two dishes are very consistent and really good. You get large portions, and I'm always full with leftovers. Unfortunately, the steaks really aren't worth it (except Steak Diane, which is just okay). I had the filet mignon, and my wife had the ribeye. They were both mediocre, and I wouldn't order them again for the price we paid. It reminded me of a ""nicer"" Applebee's steak, which is the last place you should be getting steak from. They were cooked alright, but the meat was a bit stringy and tasted lower-quality (perhaps even lower grade) than other steaks in the area. Like mentioned above, neither of us have been overly impressed with any dish other than the pastas. Still, we find ourselves back there after shopping sometimes.  The waiters are friendly but usually a bit stiff due to how busy they are (being right next to the mall) we often don't get refills on drinks until it's too late, and the limited interactions we have with them feel rushed  The desserts aren't great unless you get cheesecake (go figure, it's in the name). I would skip dessert unless you're dying for cheesecake. Even then, there are way too many choices and I would advise sticking to tried and true flavors. I recently tried their chocolate layer cake, and it was dry and boring.  Despite other reviews, I love the dark ambience of this restaurant. To be honest, I think it makes the experience better, and a semi-romantic place to take a date or spouse. Basically, the darkness makes this restaurant seem way nicer than it actually is. This is a great ""stepping stone"" if you're just getting into nicer restaurants, because it's pricier and better than, say, Applebee's, but won't completely break the bank. We eat here when we want pasta, but definitely not when we want to eat at a super nice restaurant. The menu is way too jumbled and confusing, and they need to cut out a lot of random dishes that I can't imagine a lot of people are ordering.  My biggest negative about this restaurant is that I feel like it hasn't figured out what it wants to be. Is it...an Italian restaurant? Is it...a nicely disguised diner? Is it a literal factory where they make black-market cheesecake, and the restaurant is just a clever attempt at distraction?

We walk in and I immediately ask if they were still serving and the hostess replied with a ""yes, we still have a few hours until close"". Perfect!

We get to ordering out meal and waited 45 minutes for our meal to be given to us. Mine was half cold, while my friend enjoyed hers. At this point I just want to go home.
