246,Kristen B.,"Medina, United States",2,5,1.0,1.0,2012-08-30,"Tonight in Naples, Florida, I had the unfortunate experience of dealing briefly with the staff in the bar area. I say briefly because 3 servers passed on the opportunity to serve me. Initially, at 7:30 pm on Thursday, I asked to sit outside and was denied because they'd stopped serving outside. So, I sat at a hightop in the bar area. First server asked me if the bartender (Ross or Russ) had helped me yet. I said no. Then he asked me if Tiffany had helped me. Again, I said no. Then he yelled to Tiffany that she had a table and she replied that she already had 6 tables. She then attempted to ask the bartender to serve my table because she was too busy, and he said no because he had to use the restroom. (Mind you, I was alone...just ONE person and all I wanted was cheesecake and coffee.) This ALL happened right in front of me. I heard every word. Obviously, I got up and left. I let the hostess know that I wasn't pleased. There are many, many restaurants in Naples. Just sayin'.

91,Kat E.,"Oakland, CA",0,109,,1.0,2013-01-02,"I will never come back to this location again. Ever. Do yourself a favor and read my review and then decide if you want to eat here. My boyfriend and I got seated and waited for 25 minutes for the waitress to finally come over and take our order for an appetizer and drinks (keep in mind we had no drinks or bread). We wait another 10 minutes and she brings one water to the table. We had ordered two waters since there are TWO people, but... Whatever. We ordered our dinner plates at this point. Another 20 minutes pass and our appetizer arrives with my boyfriend's water. We take a bite of the Crispy Taquitos and they are cold and chewy. Our waitress is nowhere to be seen since she last gave us our water and hasn't refilled it once. I noticed a manager walking by our table and asked him if we could please get another appetizer since ours was cold and practically uncooked. He grabbed the plate and walked away. Another 20 minutes pass and the waitress is still nowhere to be found. My boyfriend and I have been sitting at this table for over a hour waiting for any type of food to be served or our drinks to be refilled and I was getting a little annoyed. I noticed another manager walking by and told him what the situation was (omitting the waitress being MIA because I didn't want to get her in trouble... Though her customer service was nonexistent). The manager glares at me and says, ""Anyone could have helped you with that"" as if I'm a child. Now I want to make this point clear, if I'm telling a manager of a restaurant a situation that I think needs his attention it's not because I'm impolite or I regularly complain about restaurant staff (I used to be a waitress, I get it). I am telling him this because he is in a position to do something about it and make our experience at this establishment better. However, if you dismiss my claims and glare at me for telling you something, do not expect me to ever come back again. Our dinner plates finally arrive another 20 minutes later with the appetizer at the same time. Our waitress seemed to realize we existed after we talked to the manager, but still never refilled our glasses until I asked her to over a hour later. Thankfully the appetizer was taken off our check because it had arrived at the end of the meal, but I still thought the whole thing was atrocious. I have no idea whether training for employees wasn't up to par or general lack of concern on the part of the managerial staff was to blame, but this has been the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to and the worst customer service I have ever received. ----------------------------------------- Update: I received a gift card in the mail for 10$ at any Cheesecake Factory. I was contacted by the manager of the restaurant to come back and have a much better experience. It was very professional of him to take the matter seriously. However, I did not accept the invite when thinking back to that horrible service and cold food. I really hope that some changes were made to improve the establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-naples?start=80,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.9160000000000004,2.6

My son ordered the kids hamburger sliders - these were cooked beyond recognition and tasted really bad.  We ordered the kids chicken strips for my 2 year old - these were hard and tasteless...couldn't even tell they were chicken actually. Both of their French fries were over cooked and hard.    My wife and both ordered the beet and goat cheese salad from the lite menu - the dressing was so incredibly tart it was difficult to force down to the point where I picked out the beets and had to leave all of the lettuce. Shockingly bad salad dressing.  The worst though was the ahi tuna appetizer I had from the lite menu. The tuna used had so much membrane in it, I literally couldn't stomach eating it.

Come bill time, our server never asked how our meal was even though there were full plates for all four of us. I asked her if the manager took my tuna off of the bill - the server didn't know anything about it. I paid anyway and on the way out, we passed the manager.

I ordered the Thai-Coconut-Lime Chicken (Definitely  give it a try). It is a nice sized portion and it was delicious. It comes with regular rice but I decided to substitute the regular rice for brown rice instead (big mistake). The brown rice was soggy... Almost to the point of being a risotto. This is the only reason why I'm giving 4 stars.  If you like curry and a bit of spice in your food this is the plate to order. It also has bits of mango chunks.... Mmmmm Mmmmm good. I accompanied my food with red sangria (very refreshing).  My friend ordered a chargrilled New York steak with asparagus and mashed potoes.... She reports that her food was great and the steak very flavorful and juicy. Greta job!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-naples,3.84,3.62,3.62,3.184,3.708
