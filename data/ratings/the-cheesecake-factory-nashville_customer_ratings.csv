203,Caroline H.,"Cambridge, MA",85,160,27.0,3.0,2012-01-08,"I tend to think of Cheesecake factory as overpriced Applebee's, but today I tried the new Skinnylicious menu. And I liked it! I got the chicken soft tacos and it was a huge portion (I didn't finish it) for under 590 calories. I also tried my friend's Tuscan chicken which was pretty good.  I couldn't find the actual calorie count online for any of the Skinnylicious items, which seems a little fishy, but I want to trust that I made good decisions today (New Year's Resolutions- what what!).

If you've never been before & have hard times deciding on what to eat you may want to look at the menu online cuz it's VERY long & EVERYTHING is so tasty. The cheesecakes are a whole new story. There are too many to choose from & they don't offer samples or let you try them out prior to purchase. So you have to spend the $7 or $8 HOPING you're gonna like the one you've picked out. Majority of the ones I've tasted were good, my favorite is the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut!! Yummmmm!!

171,Howard L.,"Nashville, TN",0,86,2.0,2.0,2012-02-09,"I'd love to see Gordon Ramsay eat at a Cheesecake Factory. I'm sure he'd rip it a new butt-hole for it's super-huge menu of average food. And I'd love to take a tour of their kitchen....the quality of some of the produce I've received has been questionable. It's average if you're lucky. Most of the time it's this side of cafeteria food. The fish and chips is a good example. I think you get better from Gordon's in the frozen food aisle.  Pros include the wait staff dress like they're ship stewards. If you look up, you'll notice how tall and useless looking the ceiling is. The drinks taste fine, although they're incredibly expensive. Getting wasted here is not cost effective.  I hesitate to say this, as it might cause a lemming like exodus to the restaurants that aren't as busy, but (never mind). Carraba's completely blows now and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. Cheeseburger Charley's is great if you're looking for a quick bite. Avoid this crappy chain with poorly trained cooks.

188,Bob D.,"Valencia, CA",6,18,,2.0,2012-03-03,"I usually avoid The Green Hills Mall like the plague, but I was hungry and had no food at my house.  More importantly, I had a gift certificate to this place and I decided it was time to give it a shot.   I admit I was a bit irritated off the bat.  I called in my order and for some reason the first person who answered the phone couldn't take my order--even though I called the number listed for take out.  I was put on hold for about 5 minutes--foreshadowing the sh""t show I was about to get myself into.  They asked me if I wanted curbside or if I wanted to pick my food up inside.  I'm not lazy, so I told the girl I'd come in.  HUGE MISTAKE. Anyways they tell me my order will be ready in about 20 minutes.  I live like a mile from the mall and it's 730 PM so I figure, ""no problem.""  After searching for a parking spot for nearly 15 minutes, I walk into the joint.  I have never been here before so I'm looking for some sort of sign as to where I can pick up my food.  None.  So I get in line to speak to the hostess.  She tells me I can pick up my food at the bakery.  I get over by the bakery and there are people sitting on the ground waiting for a table at this joint.  Ridiculous.  Another reviewer mentioned feeling agoraphobic.  I could not agree more.  From the moment I walked in, I could not wait to get out of this place.  People everywhere.  How about an ""excuse me, sir"" instead of elbowing and pushing your way through?  I get it though you're probably pissed you've been waiting 2 hours to get a table for some food a step above Applebees in quality.   So I proceed to wait in a line for the bakery to get my takeout meal.  Mind you the reason I ordered takeout was to avoid lines and people for that matter.  How ironic I'm being smothered by people and I've been in 3 lines (if you consider waiting for a parking spot in the lot a line).  I finally get to the register and the employee is pleasant.  The hostess was pleasant too, but I'm pretty cute and we all know cute people get treated better than ugly ones.  So I am finally able to pick up my food, make the 2 block trek back to my car and get home to a barely warm meal I heated up in the Microwave.   Yes, there are certain things that I had control over in this experience.  I should have done the curbside pickup and I could avoided most of the irritation.  However, it still doesn't change the fact that the food was average, the wait mentionable and the atmosphere uncomfortable to say the least.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=200,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.7920000000000007,3.1600000000000006

It was delicious as well. The experience couldn't have been better as far as the food goes, the seating and drinks could use some improvement.  After waiting over an hour to be seated (expect that on a weekend night), we were seated in the dreadful ""bistro"" seating which consists of small two person tables that are arranged and separated by less than ten inches.  Boo.  It's hard not only for the servers to help you, but it's even harder to have a private conversation.  My husband and I got a kick out of the situation, but we will probably order dinner out next time we want the Cheesecake Factory for that reason.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=180,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.9600000000000004,3.2400000000000007

162,Katie D.,"Austin, TX",69,282,5.0,4.0,2012-05-20,"I like this place, it's certainly the best option at the Mall at Green Hills. I'm from out of town so when I visit this mall, the food court options have no appeal to me (I can have Chick-fil-A at home, thanks) so I try to pick places I can't have back home. Thus, when I'm there I go for Cheesecake Factory. To be technical, I'd probably give them a 3.5/5 - they're not awful, but they don't live up to the hype nearly as much as they should, given whenever you go there's always a wait. I mean hey, good for them to not be hurting for business, but it sucks when you're on a time crunch and don't have time to wait 20 minutes to be seated, especially when it usually ends up being 30-35 minutes in a tiny, cramped space where there's never enough seats and always too many antsy kids. But hey, the waiting area is never that big in restaurants. But the noise level of the restaurant is ridiculous. The acoustics suck (and do in all locations, I've been to others) and it causes everyone to echo, giving it a noisy, cafeteria-like atmosphere. Hardly the upscale-but-still-kinda-casual vibe they're going for. Other than that though, it's not bad. They have some of the best lemonade I've ever had. Most restaurants offer crappy Minute Maid, so it's nice to get it at places like this where it's freshly squeezed, and the sugar rimmed glasses are a nice touch. The menu is just ridiculous, in both a good and bad way. Especially on your first visit it's just plain overwhelming, and there's some stuff that's just not that good. Though some of what I've had is great: - The American Kobe burger sucks. Save the money and get a regular burger. The meat doesn't taste any different and isn't any more tender than a burger you'd get at Chili's. + Chicken and biscuits are good. Their biscuits are a shortcake batter so they're interesting, and their gravy's good, though I'm sure it's pre-made. - The fish and chips suck. They're frozen, for starters. And for someone who's had authentic fish and chips overseas, wrapped in newspaper...it's a huge disappointment. + The crab cake is good. I don't get it, but someone I go with usually does who's from the Maryland area originally so it must be okay. I've only had their cheesecake once since the portions are so huge. I can never make room for it. But the serving of cheesecake is small, far smaller than the cheesecake I've had anywhere else. It was good though, I just can't remember if I tried the key lime or the vanilla bean cheesecake. Maybe I've had both, but regardless their cheesecake is good.

It's the kind of place that literally has EVERYTHING so picky eaters will have lots of options to chose from. I do appreciate the ""skinnylicious"" menu (though I'll admit to feeling pretty stupid using the name when I order from it.)

216,Patrick H.,"CANE RIDGE, TN",22,21,1.0,2.0,2012-06-27,"I hear a lot of people talk about The Cheesecake Factory and on how great it is. I don't see what all the hype is all about really. Great how??? Decided to go on a Sunday afternoon around 5pm. First off, we had to wait about 30 min to be seated. I got a great view of seeing people enter and exit the restaurant every 5 seconds. Plus, it was raining and we couldn't wait in the lobby because there were 50 people waiting to be seated and about 20 people waiting to get cheesecake. After the wait, we had to go searching for the host and finally we heard him screaming over the crowd. We were seated next to two other couples. I felt like I was in a school cafeteria. I could reach over and slap the woman next to me or eat off her plate if I wanted to...but I would never do anything that crazy, but you get the idea. We were that close to each other. I really didn't like the fact we were able to hear other people's conversation in full detail. This place is extremely loud. You can't keep anything private unless you're in your own booth, which, that's where I wish we were. The table was small and before the server finally arrived at our table, I was ready to go. I got frustrated going through the menu and I wanted it to be over, so I decided to get the Smoke Burger, or whatever it's called. I've had a better burger at Burger King and I think the fries were just ok. I'm sure other things on the menu are good, but I'll never find out. The only reason I'm giving this two stars and not one is because the server was really nice and professional. The food was at our table fast and she did a good job checking on us to see if we needed anything. She was tipped very well and if I knew her name, I would name drop and give her kudos for her hard work. My opinion, go to Cheesecake Factory for the cheesecake only and get it to go! If you like waiting, loud conversation, food that you could probably get better at Applebee's and bumping into people, go for it. Don't believe the hype!!

We made the mistake of ordering the ahi tuna salad, which has tuna lightly seared on the outside, uncooked in the middle. One of our orders was clearly not fresh, and the other for some reason was smothered in red pepper to the point one could not taste the fish.

222,Kate C.,"Antioch, TN",56,5,2.0,1.0,2012-11-18,"A group of 10 of us decided to celebrate a friend's birthday at this restaurant. We chose valet parking. We arrived at 6:30 PM, fully aware that there would be a hefty wait, but we were willing because everyone loves the Cheesecake Factory experience. We were told there would be a 2.5 hr wait and shortly after we were told it was dropped down to 1.5 hr. About every 30 min we would check in to see what the wait was and we were constantly told ""About 20 min"". We were finally seated at 9 PM. It took approximately 15 min for water to be served and bread to be brought to our table. Everyone ordered a round of drinks and it took another 20 minutes for those to arrive. When my friend asked if there were gluten free options, our waitress, Dawn, told her that she couldn't guarantee anything and she would be taking a gamble with anything she ordered. My friend, who rarely comes out because of anxiety, was treated with an incredible amount of disrespect and left her irritated and stressed about dinner the rest of the night. At this point, I went and talked to the manager to let him know what the waitress said. As we ordered our dinner, we also ordered a second round of drinks. Menus were never taken away from our table and appetizer dishes were stacked high before they were cleared away. Dinner came, we all finished our food and plates were cleared away before our drinks even arrived. At that point, no one cared to have another drink, but since the drinks are priced so high we didn't have a choice. I left the table again to talk to a different manager, Travis. I told him about our experience and how we were extremely disappointed with our service. I let him know that we were all willing to wait the long amount of time because we all love this restaurant but the experience once we sat down was completely unacceptable. He apologized and was very gracious. He offered to buy everyone's dessert and also was going to take off the auto 18% tip. When we asked for dessert menus, 1 was brought to us for a table of 10. Another 20 minutes went by before we were able to order. Our dessert came out one by one, making the night even slower. Had our waitress been bringing us our bills at that point we would have been able to speed the process up. Instead we had to track her down. She was tipped poorly by everyone. By the time we left the restaurant it was 11:35 PM. The valet service closed at 9:30 PM. We were the only car left and the employee had to wait only for us. Our plans to go out after dinner for my friends birthday were ruined because we spent over 5 hours at dinner for what was the absolute worst dining experience myself and the others in the group have ever had ANYWHERE. We chose The Cheesecake Factory because we have all been avid fans of it for over 10 years.

247,Gabrielle T.,"New York, NY",8,29,2.0,4.0,2013-01-01,"So a friend suggested that we go to The Cheesecake Factory as my birthday outing dinner choice, and I wasn't disappointed! We did have a short wait (30 minutes), but it was New Year's Eve, so it was to be expected. It's usually a good sign for a restaurant if there is a wait, though, right? Anywho, firstly - this is very ridiculous of me, but also a sign of how easy I am to impress: they serve bread - two kinds in fact! One brown-in-color with grains scattered about here and there, and your run of the mill Italian style loaf. Unfortunately I'm one of those customers that becomes quietly disgruntled if there isn't bread. Sad I know. It's the little things. I'll continue to the juice, the important part if you will.  I did not like how close we sat to other tables...it's the style where there's one seating rail against a wall, and little two-seater tables lined up with about 21/2 feets space between the other man's table on either side, and a on the opposite end of table. I understand this is typical some places, but when you're out for dinner and not at a bar, you generally don't want to hear your neighbors' conversation or vice versa. The server was friendly and accommodating. We never felt rushed, which I strongly appreciate. When I go out to dinner, I despise the feeling of ""okay, you're done - now please leave because we need turnover."" The food: I had the grilled veggie burger accompanied by a salad with vinaigrette dressing as my main entree, ordered from 'The Skinnylicious' menu. While I know it might not sound appealing to a lot - YUM! Very flavorful and delicious. The salad consisted of a fluffy, deceivingly generous portion of rich-in-color mixed greens, with a tomato or two, dowsed in the vinaigrette dressing. I assumed it would taste as one would expect - nothing to write home about, it's lettuce, right? That dressing was amazing! I don't love vinaigrettes, though I'm trying to. But this one was on the mark. Unique and delicious. Oh, and for drink I had the strawberry lemonade, which was seriously addictive. I went through a solid 3 refills without a problem in an embarrassingly short amount of time. Onto the cheesecake: I ordered the tiramisu cheesecake, and my friend ordered the carrot cake cheesecake. The carrot cake cheesecake was okay, however the tiramisu was decadent! So yum! As an added yay!-point, My cheesecake came with a candle in whipped cream, lighted by the server at the table, and ""Happy Birthday!"" written in chocolate sauce around the plate.

The joke being their menu is so huge they have to take out ads to support the printing costs. And, impressively, for a place that has American, Italian, Mexican, Japanese and more, they do it all quite well. Portions are huge, bread is really good, and desserts are worth skipping the main course. That being said, the wait at Cheesecake Factory's gotten to the point that we avoid it. Weekends, you can face a 90+ minute wait - and that was even for a table for 2. Brunch, Lunch and Dinner, the waits are getting to be a little crazy - the best times are off-peak times or weekdays. The last time we tried, we waited for an hour and 45 minutes and were told it may be another 10-15 minutes... I ended up handing off my pager to another couple who had just arrived, and my wife and I went elsewhere. So while the food is good, it lately has not been good enough to warrant the wait. Update: Wanting to give them another shot, I tried again on a Tuesday at 6:30. We were told it would be a half hour. An hour and 15 minutes later, we were told we were at the top of the list and just needed a table to free up. The manager said he would do a quick walk-around to see if any tables were clearing up, and finally after waiting about an hour and 20 minutes, we had our table.

So, look - there are some reasons why you would go to Cheesecake Factory: 1.)  You are at Green Hills Mall 2.)  You really enjoy mediocre chain food 3.)  You love menus that are longer than any Harry Potter Book 4.)  You enjoy good Cheesecake 5.)  Someone gave you a gift card and you haven't been able to use it yet 6.)  You are a tourist #5 was my reason.   So, I went to my first Cheesecake factory in Atlanta years ago (and several other since).  It was ok.  Long wait, mediocre food, good cheesecake, terrible service.  When they finally came to Nashville - my boyfriend at the time and I went to check it out.  We waited for nearly 2 hours for a table.  When we were finally seated - we were seated at a 4 Top table (table large enough for 4 people).  It was a terrible table.  When we were seated - we recognized how awful the table was and asked if we could be seated at a different table.  In fact, right next to this table was another 4 Top that was much nicer.  The person that sat us rolled her eyes and said ""If you want a different table you'll have to go back up front and wait for a different table...""  What?  What difference did it make?  Why would we be required to wait longer when we already waited 2 hours.  Needless to say that attitude coupled with the mediocre food, terrible service and high price kept me away until now.  I had a gift card and, until recently, had sat in my wallet for nearly 2 years.  It was time to clean it out.  So, another trip to Cheesecake Factory was in order so I took a friend with me. This time the wait wasn't so long.  We only waited about 45 minutes.  Still, that was quite a long time to wait.  We were seated and, before long, the server was out to see us and got our drink order.   I am one of those people who drinks like a fish - so, most servers have a hard time keeping up with me.  This guy had NO problem. Many times I was taking my last sip and bam - another glass was right there.  I was impressed! We ordered our food and when it came - there were 2 problems.  First, my friend's order was wrong and second - the fries that came with my buffalo chicken sandwich were cold.  Like, not even the slightest bit warm.   Here comes the part where I was really impressed - the manager, without prompting from us, came to our table with a new plate for my roomie, realizing that the order was wrong.  I'm guessing perhaps two people ordered the same thing and they sent the wrong plate to our table.  in defense of Cheesecake factory - he ordered a dish with chicken and shrimp and asked for just chicken.  It came with both...so, it's not the way it's traditionally served.  But, they had the correct order on the table just moments after the 'wrong' one arrived.  Nice! I never did complain about my fries because, after all, I was just here trying to spend a gift card and I'd likely never come back anyway.  So, I was afraid if I complained they might take it off my order and then I'd be left with more money to spend...and I didn't want that. All in all - the service was impressive, the food was blah and the cheesecake was, of course, incredible.   If you want a good place to eat in Nashville - this is NOT it.  If you want a place to get a good piece of cheesecake - by all means - stop by.   I really do wish that server the best, though.  He was incredible.  But, other than the cheesecake and the service - I have never, ever found a reason, food wise, to return.  The food is overpriced and of mediocre quality.  The food seems very chain-like and corporate.  AKA - nothing to write home about.   But, if you fit one of the 6 reasons above to go - by all means...Just be expected to wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=180,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.8600000000000003,3.2800000000000002

Our waiter, (whose name was never even divulged), approached our table in a hastily manner and greeted us with, ""What's going on here""? Puzzled by his abrupt greeting we replied in confusion that we'd like to start with the Warm Crab & Artichoke dip. I understand Saturday nights are hectic and the restaurant is extremely busy, however I did not find it appropriate to hasten our dining experience due to their inability to cater to multiple parties simultaneously. As our appetizer arrived and before we even took one bite, our server came out to tell us that it was a, ""23 minute ticket"", and that our entrees were already prepared. He asked us if we wanted it anymore to which we declined & requested our entrees. He proceeded to take our appetizer away, then returned with it saying it was on the house. One bite in, and I see something shiny hanging off my partner's cracker. It was dimly lit so I assumed it was a cheese strand, later to discover it was a blonde hair. Neither myself, nor my partner has blonde hair. As we showed our waiter, his response was, ""Good thing it was on the house"". I was appalled at his response to say the least. Our entrees arrived, and were delicious as expected. Approximately mid-way through our final course I noticed what I thought was a small fly on the wall directly next to my face. I asked my partner what it was, he replied, ""it's just as fly"". As I blew air at it in an attempt to make it disperse, it only crawled closer and closer towards me. I ripped a piece of napkin from the bread basket and squished the bug from the wall and threw it on a used appetizer plate on our table for closer examination. To our horror, it was a baby cockroach. At this point my meal and complete dining experience at Cheesecake Factory was utterly ruined. Our server got one of the managers, Jose, and he offered us free cheesecake (which I was not sure I even wanted), and to comp our entire meal, (water, an uneaten appetizer, two half eaten entrees, and a slice of cheesecake to go). He also ensured us that the restaurant gets, ""bombed"" every month and that the next scheduled was the upcoming week.  I understand completely that a fine establishment such as Cheesecake Factory would have such a long wait time on the busiest day of the week. With this understanding however, I am unsure as to why the staff is not properly trained, or adequate enough to accommodate these conditions. I also comprehend that poor timing, accidents, and uninvited creatures can happen. What is baffling to me is how ALL of these mishaps occurred in ONE night, to ONE dining party.

I can only imagine that Nashville locals aren't appreciative of the super delicious dishes that CK Factory is legendary for.  I'm speculating here; Southern pallets prefer a down home cooked styled meal. Either that or the locals aren't fan of the 20 plus minutes of waiting required before seating. Maybe it's the crowd that CKF draws. I mean people pack the booths and tables often. It can get quite a busy. Call ahead if you can to avoid the major buzz kill when you arrive. If you're in a party you may want someone to scout ahead, get there early and reserve a a table or two.  If this is your first time to the CKF you may suffer sticker shock. Word to the wise, prepare for a bill of at least $60 for a couple not including drinks. If you're comfortable with that price tag then you're in for a great meal.  Newbies should be wisely advised to save room for dessert. Hard to do cause CKF always off generous portions. The entrée are spectacular but the deserts are what makes you a believer.

Cons: Large menu-seriously there are way too many things on it! If you have over 200 menu items, it's too much.  Almost always busy, so long waits.  The dim lighting goes a little far (I know you're trying to create the atmosphere, but you can barely read the tiny print on the menus-and I don't have bad vision at all!)  Also the spinach dip was basically just spinach & artichokes, not nearly cheesy or flavorful enough.

More like just all marinara and no cheese, except for the blob of ricotta in the middle. I am not one to complain in restaurants, so I ate what few bites I could put down and that was it.   The pro: the cheesecake I ordered was out of this world!! Dulce (some type of caramel). I have been dreaming about it since I ate it! Its delicious!   Regarding staff dress code: they look dirty! At least their clothes and shoes. And I'm not talking about hygiene. Look at those workers shoes! What should be white is nasty and dirty! Makes me wonder how clean the kitchen is, because I know that is where most of their traffic is too. How about this...wouldn't it be better (I know it would look better) for the hostesses (who don't get dirty) to wear white? And the servers to wear black?

We went through 3 different waitresses until we finally were able to order our food!  3. We paid $13 for 3 small spring rolls as an appetizer. The portions are ridiculously small for the price. Their dinner entrees are a generous amount but again, my food came out unappetizing. If you choose an appetizer, their fried calamari is bomb!  However, their cheesecake is to die for. It is hands down the best cheesecake I have ever put in my mouth! If you go here to try it out, I recommend going during lunch time or before the dinner rush. Don't be alarmed with the bad reviews but do take caution and the worst that could happen is you getting a over cooked steak or dry pasta!

I say this because, at least at this location, cleanliness and other such ""surface"" issues seem to be taking a backseat because they know people will still file in by the dozen and pay the over-priced cost of their meals. During my most recent visit, our table was not wiped down properly before we were seated as there were obvious crumbs on the table. The service was decent but a bit too clingy and earnest. The menu, as always, is almost overwhelming with choices but the majority of the entrees here are really good which makes up, for most people, for everything else. The Cheesecake is the big draw, but while I have never had a bad piece of cheesecake here, I don't find it so special that it is necessarily worth the price or the calories.

And we busied ourselves by wandering through the shops close by. Seated, ordered 4 waters, and got our bread without any hesitation or anything of note. We ordered our food (4 cheese pasta with chicken, Skinnylicious chicken pasta, and I can't remember what the other two in our group got.) and it came out pretty promptly. The servings are large, but the chicken in my pasta might've amounted up to a half of a chicken breast if I'm honest. My girlfriend wasn't overly happy about about her pasta either because it looked more like a bowl full of diced tomatoes with a smattering of pasta noodles. To me it was not worth the $17 for mine, or for hers. But, they were alright. Then we went onto dessert. I'm a sucker for a classic cheesecake. No strawberries, no cherries, no sauce. Plain ol' cheesecake. My girlfriend on the other hand, is not the cheesecake connoisseur that I consider myself. She got the Oreo cheesecake, and when it was all over, it looked like someone had murdered a pack of oreos and whipped cream on her plate.

Her parents were eating with friends so she got a nearby booth for the three of us. I had never been here before but I had just eaten lunch with my mom and grandma so I wasn't that hungry. I ordered an entree and hubby ordered hot chocolate and a dessert and we split them both. I really loved the bread they brought to the table- wheat and white loaves. I definitely preferred the wheat, as did my friend. My waitress was named Becky and she was amazing.  I asked for the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta with angel hair pasta instead of penne. They brought out penne and let me eat it while they corrected the mistake. I have to admit, penne was easier to eat. The meal itself is kind of soupy or wet so the angel hair pasta made it a messy meal. I will stick with penne next time! Becky let me keep both (yay!).  Onto the entree itself. The flavor of the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta was amazing. However, most of the pieces of chicken in it were gristle and I didn't eat them. But the rest of it was great and it made great leftovers. Hubby and I were totally going to share the leftovers but ended up devouring it ourselves the next day instead.  The Dulce de Leche Hot Chocolate was so excellent my hubby only let me have a few sips before drinking it all himself. I wasn't as impressed with the Dulce de Leche Cheesecake but it was good as well.  When we came a second time I was excited to see a Thai-themed dinner dish, Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp so I got it (with brown rice!).

Our waiter was Salvador (""Sal""), we ordered an appetizer, and after waiting 25 min. we asked why it hadn't been brought to us yet. Sal said ""he forgot about it but not to worry because our main food would be up shortly"". He didn't offer much of an apology for the mistake or anything. When our other food came, there was a large hair in one of our dishes. When we told Sal he again didn't give much of an apology.

70,Stacy B.,"Brentwood, TN",171,123,73.0,2.0,2015-11-08,"Today I'm giving Cheesecake Factory 2 stars. My teenage son and I were eating here, Wednesday night, about 8 PM. He was bugging out on me, he was so hungry. I was literally watching him fall apart before me, and seemingly revert to a toddler once again (you know, he's 'above' reading anything his mom might write, so I don't have to worry that he'll see this, hehe).     So, the main goal was to get some food in him as quickly as possible. It was at least 5 minutes before anyone said a word to us...so I had no idea if we even had a waiter! Oh, and the hostess sat us at a table that had the floor covered with YUCK all underneath it. My son was trying to shove it out of the way with his foot - there was so much of it. It looked like a few really messy kids had sat there. I pointed it out...first mentioning it to the hostess seating us and when that was ignored, literally pointing it out to her. She did nothing. We had to sit in that filth the entire meal.  really?        I made it clear to our waiter how starving my son was, so at least he tried to get some bread out within 15 minutes, and tried to move our order along (I think). It was a loooong wait between bread and meal though. At one point he told us it was ready and being ""plated"" right then, so it would be right out. Nope...another 5-10 minutes. This is for a burger, grilled cheese and fries. Once it did come out, the fries weren't with it. He said they were cooking, but he didn't want to make us wait longer for something to eat. They did come pretty quickly after that, and were hot and fresh. My grilled cheese was good. The burger he barely touched. He said it was dry. When asked about splops on his plate that I thought was juice or grease from his burger, he assured me it was not. In fact, he said the burger was drowned in condiments, as if they were trying to make up for the dryness of the burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=80,3.16,3.3,3.3,2.6960000000000006,3.2440000000000007

We ordered from the Skinnylicious Menu and I got the Grilled Steak Medallions (Certified Angus Beef® Served with Fresh Asparagus, Shiitake Mushrooms, Sauteed Cherry Tomatoes, Crushed Croutons, Mashed Potatoes and Madeira Wine Sauce). My husband got a tossed green salad (with divine Bleu Cheese dressing!) and the Skinnylicious® Chicken Enchiladas (Covered with Our Red Chile Sauce and Melted Cheese. Served with Escabeche Vegetable Salad). He really liked the salad (it was HUGE) and his enchiladas.  He let the Escabeche veggies go--just didn't appeal to him.  I ADORED my steak medallions.  They were cooked to perfection, and were an excellent match to the asparagus, mushrooms, tomatoes. The meat sat in a bed of heavenly mashed potatoes and it was all smothered in the Madeira Wine sauce...all for under 600 calories and it tasted like a million!!!  I only ate half (the portions were that big!) and was able to enjoy the meal for another sitting! We both ordered cheesecake to go.  I have an affinity for their Peppermint Bark Cheesecake (White chocolate cheesecake swirled with chunks of chocolate peppermint bark, topped with white chocolate mousse and finished with chopped peppermint) but it's only available during the holiday season.  When I found out that there was some in the case, I was ecstatic!  When I found out that was the LAST of the Peppermint Bark Cheesecakes that they had, I grabbed up two slices (and I think finished off that last cake!)!! I ate it later and it did not fail to delight!  AWESOMENESS!!!  My hubby got some kind of chocolate on top of chocolate on top of chocolate selection and was a happy camper.

Sometimes you'll be greeted by some ladies with attitude up front, but that happens infrequently.

I didn't bother to remember his name because I was already pretty irked - but luckily I was pretty hungry so we didn't leave.

The negative for me was the food did  not come to our table hot, but Luke warm, like it was under a heating lamp. I order the Steak Diane and Chicken Madera combination. The cheesecake was very rich and flavorful which I am sure is their number#1 seller(over 30 flavors).  I got a chance to walk off my calories at the Green Hills Mall, but that is another review in if itself!

150,Teresa H.,"Cary, NC",0,1,,1.0,2016-09-10,"Had a bad experience that the management staff simply made worse. Arrived last night and requested a patio table. Noticed that the table was wet which we pointed out to the hostess who simply said they had just sanitized them. After sitting down we noticed the smell of bleach and wondered about it. After ordering our drinks from the waitress, the other person in my party noticed a spot on her shirt. When she stood up to let me look at it, we discovered it was where bleach was bleaching out the color of the shirt. She turned around and we saw more spots on both her shirt and pants and then saw that my shirt was bleached as well. We immediately told the waitress who brought over the shift manager. She apologized profusely and admitted she had cleaned the area with bleach to try and get rid of a major fly problem they had been having. We moved to a table inside where we were told they would take care of our meal and they just wanted us to relax and enjoy our meal and not worry about anything and she would check on how they would take care of our clothes problem. We ordered 2 appetizers, drinks and cheesecake as we had originally planned. We were told we would have to buy replacement garments and bring back receipts to be sent to corporate who would reimburse us. When we were ready to leave, I was brought a bill with a single appetizer comped after being told the entire would be covered. Returned today with receipts for replacement clothing and spoke to the general manager who was flippant and acted like HE was being inconvenienced by having to deal with this! Also made him aware that we were told the meal would be covered and then were handed the bill with the single appetizer comped and wanted to know if he would make it right and give us credit as we had been told. Again he acted annoyed and begrudgingly said he would see what he could do. We will be contacting corporate ourselves to see if they will make this right. It is offensive to be treated like we are being a problem when we are the ones that had our clothes ruined by their mistake and our day was disrupted with having to go search for replacements today instead of doing what we planned because I am visiting from out of town just for the weekend. Good customer service means you put the customer first and make things right when you mess up. And you most certainly do not make the customer feel like you are the one being inconvenienced and that they (the customer) are being unreasonable. And you absolutely do not lie and say you will cover a meal and then hit them with the bill at the end!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=140,2.76,3.28,3.28,2.724,3.072

It turned out to be a Thai salmon on rice with snow peas. I am glad I saw it as it was delicious. I could have eaten it all, but opted to bring home half to enjoy the next day. Unfortunately, a house guest ate it before I could so I should have just devoured the whole thing while I had the chance! My date had a salad - avocado and turkey, I think, but I never remember what my guest has unless they complain - and she didn't.

Me and the son-in-law - first time. Why did we not go with them the other times? This is OBVIOUSLY  a chick place - obviously... We had eaten lunch a little early. We went to Cheekwood Mansion and walked the grounds for a couple of hours. My wife had a gift card for here and it was her birthday. This and the fact that we were a little (me, a lot) hungry - perfect storm. Oh! - and the mere mention of cheesecake to a woman - any other suggestions you make fall on deaf ears. You're talking and all they hear is blah, blah, blah...""How about Indian food?"" blah, blah, blah. ""How about sushi?"" blah, blah, blah. ""Steak might be good."" blah, blah, blah. ""Cheesecake Factory?"" ""Oh - The Cheesecake Factory will be fine dear - if you are sure that's what you want. I'm OK with anywhere!"" The women said the entrees here were huge. So I'm thinking - huge as in lady portion huge or huge as in manly man huge? I took their word for it and each couple ordered an entrée to share - Chicken Madeira . I did make it understood that if they were wrong we were stopping at the Burger King down the road after we left - and I wouldn't share. I was expecting a single chicken breast with the toppings described and a smidgen of pasta - we subbed angel hair pasta for the mashed potatoes. WOW! There were two chicken breast and more than enough pasta for two. There was a server holding each end of the plates while bringing our selection to the table and they were struggling at that - I may have exaggerated a little. The Madeira sauce blended so well with the angel hair pasta (or was it Madea - Oh Lordt).  I thought my wife loved me, but there was no to go box for her leftovers as she offered what she could not eat to our son-in-law. I'm going to probably need advice on a divorce lawyer...  After a short nap, we ordered four different cheesecake variations - can't remember what they were, but all were top notch. Not one of us could eat it all and we all received to-go boxes - HA! Mr. Son-in-Law! This is mine!!! In my opinion - the portions are way too large for one person. In our case we shared entrees and still took food home - well I didn't as previously mentioned - (let it go Ron, let it go). They DO NOT offer half portions which would be ideal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville,3.2,3.21,3.21,2.8000000000000003,3.206

Nothing, and I mean nothing was probably washed before bring it out, looking nice is a bowl.  And for some reason they also served cold hard bread? In my understanding, the bread usually comes out warm, at least in our Charlotte, Nc and all Ohio locations. We nicely asked out server, who gladly replaced it but again with a hard cold one.  Never-mind the bread, but the salad was a deal breaker. How can something so simple that requires no cooking can taste so horrible and full of chemicals?  The lady manager came and made no apologies.

10,Robert E.,"Murfreesboro, TN",215,153,,4.0,2017-08-08,"Just left Cheesecake Factory. Was by myself looking for a great meal at a favorite place. First of all I had to wait 10 min. for a host to come to the front desk. I told him a party of one and he said step aside someone will be with you shortly. I was the only person in line. 2-3 minutes later a lady came and called my name and headed toward the bar area. I told her that I preferred not to sit in the bar area it was nosey (which is understandable) and the tables offer no privacy. When I told her that she seemed disgusted by my request and immediately said-""we have no tables available in regular seating, it will be awhile."" I stood there for a second stunned because I was looking at 6-8 tables that were empty. I simply said thanks but I will go elsewhere. She just wadded up my ticket and walked away. Haha- didn't realize I was such a bother! Have had great service before- but this time Cheesecake Factory was a loser! I want to update a previous review. My wife and I gave Cheesecake Factory another try today and our results were much different than before. We were warmly welcomed and seated within two minutes of arriving. Our wait staff was quick and helpful. Of course the menu is vast with plenty of choices. My wife measures every restaurant by the quality of their ""fish and chips""- today she gave the Cheesecake Factory a ""A"" on their ""fish and chips."" I had the lunch size salmon and it was excellent. We had the side dish of Cole slaw and it was yummy. The restaurant is very clean and modern in decor.

Waitresses get a bad rap because management refuses to hire or schedule enough wait staff to service their clientele. My experience starting out poorly in the fact that I was seated and handed a menu and had to wait almost 10 minutes for the waitress to show up to take a drink order. I might have expected this if they have been super busy but four of the tables in my section were empty. When she arrived she took my drink order and our dinner order and left. I actually think she might have left altogether, because 15 minutes later I hadn't seen her even walk past our area of the restaurant. My dinner partner actually got up and filled our water glasses himself, even though two other waitresses walked by with water pictures and filled all of the tables around us. Finally after waiting for what seemed like an eternity and still not seeing my waitress, I flag down a manager and asking to cancel my order because I was leaving. I would like to say I will return to this establishment but after this experience I find that highly unlikely. Most servers in large chains like this have to share tips and that is suppose to encourage the staff to help cover each other's tables, because an happy customer is a tipping customer.  If they share tips here then management has failed to instill in it's employees a since of team work that will help this restaurant thrive. The sad thing about this whole event is that this restaurant has excellent food for a big chain. However, if many more customers have an experience like mine it won't matter how good the food is because people just won't come to taste it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=20,2.96,3.17,3.17,,3.086

This chain seriously needs a hostess training overhaul.  No matter the location, the cheesecake factory hostesses are straight up unprofessional and rude.  It's like having to go through hell just to be seated and get the great food that I love to eat. One exception, Houston TX at the galleria, that hostess rocks, but any other locations I've visted: Seattle, Chicago, Nashville,  the hostesses act like they're possessed by the devil. FACT! At this location we waited 1 hr and 20 mins. I was told it would be 40mins by the rude hostess. As we waited we watched guests enter and be seated before us. I asked could we sit in the bar first come first serve, the hostess looked over at the bar area and said "" only the bar stools or high tops, not the booths or tables and good luck finding one"" though hellish rude, she was right as there were 3 high tops vacant but were cover with dishes and were dirty. They stayed that way much of the time we waited. After 1hr 20 mins my friend went up and asked why others were being seated before us, the hostess rolled her eyes and whispered to another hostess something and we were told to wait at the hostess station. At this time our buzzer went off and we were seated another 5 mins from then. Our server greeted us and informed us that this was ""like my 5th shift, so bare with me"" . He was slow and unprofessional in serving us, he seemed to be frustrated the entire time. He didn't know the ingredients in the dishes nor did he check to find out. I informed him of my allergy to onions, he just strugged his shoulders. I went on Facebook to the cheesecake factory page and posted a comment.  I noticed that the chain didn't comment on any of the complaints just the compliments. So cheesecake factory could care less if I eat there again, so I wont. The Macaroni Grill in opry mills mall is where I'll go.  I love being treated like a human being and Macaroni Grill has done just that all 4 times I've visited no matter the location.  It's a shame that not all restaurants like their guests because each one has different cuisine to experience.  But it's not very smart to spend $60 to be treated poorly when there's a Macaroni Grill that will love for me to visit their restaurant and to serve me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=40,3.0,3.14,3.14,,3.0840000000000005

After spending the day with my family at the Adventure Science Museum, we selected this a celebratory destination for dinner. It was evening and it was crowded, about a 30 minute wait. The restaurant a bit loud, a bit too dark and maybe because they were busy, we were served by multiple people which created confusion while ordering. Our drinks came out looking and tasting delicious and while expensive ($12), I was satisfied with the quality. We ordered the Crispy Crab Bites and the Ahi TarTare for appetizers which were exceptionally small and disappointing, literally 4 tortilla chips. Dinner included Fish Tacos, Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic and my choice, the Factory Combination Steak Diana and Shrimp Scampi. The garlic butter sauce was delicious but the shrimp breaded and fried.. why!? Not what the description said. My steak medallions were cooked to my requested medium but sitting in copious amounts of oil, the flavor was there but I moved them over the the shrimp side of the dry potato mountain. The presentation of meals was lackluster and messy with the pasta bowl reminiscent of ratatouille. For the price that I paid I am not happy. Many improvements can be made in the quality and value of the food, attention to the order and maybe an increase in staff to better handle peak times.

Good time.  More Long Island Iced Teas for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville,2.88,3.09,3.208,,3.006
