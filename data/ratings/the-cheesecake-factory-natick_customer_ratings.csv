203,Robyn H.,"Houston, TX",4,80,35.0,4.0,2012-01-08,"Typical Cheesecake Factory experience. Good service with quick seating and the perfect type of waiter (stops by the table frequently but not too frequently and very helpful with questions and special orders). Drinks were replenished quickly. Food arrived hot and on time. We both ordered the Crusted Chicken Romano and as usual it was perfect. You could cut the chicken with a fork it was so tender. Ordered the tiramisu for desert. Portions are always large with enough for leftovers of both dinner and desert. I will continue to visit the Natick Cheesecake when in the area. Parking is always annoying though, but worth it for the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=140,3.28,3.28,3.28,3.056,3.2800000000000002
153,Jim L.,"Waltham, MA",2,37,,3.0,2012-02-06,"The food is pretty standard for the chain - you don't go to any Cheesecake Factory expecting fine dining, but you also don't expect Applebee's quality. This location fits comfortably in that niche.  The three stars, however, are mostly because the tiny size of the dining room results in ridiculous wait times even during off hours. We went at 4:45 on a Saturday and had a half-hour wait, people arriving soon after us were told 50+ minutes. If you're in Boston and looking to go to a Cheesecake Factory, spare yourself the heartburn and find another location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=160,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.9560000000000004,3.3200000000000003
119,Taco E.,"Framingham, MA",5,63,5.0,3.0,2012-03-14,"I am a fan of this Cheesecake Factory although I do have one big complaint: the water. It is chlorinated (aka TOILET WATER) and just plain disgusting. I like to have a water when I order an alcoholic beverage and this place just doesn't do it for me. You'd think they'd have decent water by how 'fancy' the place seems. Everything else is great, I would just stay away from the water. I warned ya! Other than that, the alcoholic beverages are fantastic and always good, the food is GREAT, always consistent, always huge portions; although the menu is way too big and I often find myself and others taking forever to decide on what to get. The cheesecake is amazing..I always get the carrot cake cheesecake but have had others and they are all yummy. Appetizers are really really great as well; I recommend the buffalo blasts, nachos, mac and cheese balls, and the asian potstickers. The parking situation is not ideal and I usually have to end up parking at the mall, unless I am there during later hours. The wait time is usually 30-40 min if you have a group, unless you're there at dinner time, it could be much longer then. I recommend going after 8:30 pm or noon-earlier to miss the rush. If you only have 2-3 people you are seated quickly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=120,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.9880000000000004,3.3600000000000003

Their salads are huge and when it first arrived I figured I'd take some home for later but I ended up polishing off the entire plate. The also have a SkinnyLicious menu to pick from. The one thing I really didn't like was the book size menu.  It was very overwhelming to look at.  On one hand it made picking harder but on the other hand if you want options they are many. Parking at the mall and out in front is always tough.  I usually give up and park in the garage and walk rather than circling the lot. As for the actual cheesecake, they have many flavors and options but again I've never been a fan so I...who love dessert....skipped it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=60,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.0200000000000005,3.3200000000000003

There's usually a huge selection of food to choose from, but now that they have the SkinnyLicious menu, I don't take as long to order my food. I initially ordered the SkinnyLicious Herb Crusted Salmon, but the waitress came back 5 minutes later to tell me that the restaurant doesn't have anymore salmon. It was only 8pm, so I was disappointed that they ran out of salmon already. However, the waitress suggested the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad, which I ended up enjoying. The ahi tuna was a little overcooked, but I really liked the wasabi vinaigrette that came with it. I normally feel guilty eating at the Cheesecake Factory, but this time I actually didn't feel bad. I was pretty full after eating my entire entree, so I ordered the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake to go. When I got around to eating it, it tasted yummy as expected. When it was time to pay the check, some other waitress grabbed my bill and charged the wrong amount...not sure how that happened since the total amount was printed right on the check.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=100,3.28,3.28,3.28,3.0520000000000005,3.2800000000000002

My daughter ordered the burrito and requested no peppers. Unfortunately it still came with the peppers. Normally we are not the kind if people who say anything but she really couldn't eat it.  We politely told the waiter and he profusely apologized and insisted on getting a new one.  This is what one would normally expect.  What was totally impressive is within 2 minutes the manager came over and also apologized.  Then came more...the manager personally delivered the new plate and said it would not be on our bill.  I've rarely received this level of service even from fancy restaurants.  I just wanted to say how impressed I was and thank you for such great service!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=200,3.36,3.36,3.36,3.2840000000000003,3.3600000000000003

158,Ann F.,"Franklin, MA",33,17,4.0,1.0,2012-05-13,"This is the only Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. If they are all as bad as this one, I do not know how they stay in business! I have been here 3 times, each time with a large party(8 people twice, 11 people once). We called and was told they did not take reservations or call ahead seating. Ok, fine. SInce one member of our party was 7 months pregnant and we also had an 18 month old, my husband went ahead to get in line. He was told it was a 90 minute wait, they really didn't have the means to accommodate large parties easily! They had to wait to get three tables together for us. After an hour, when my husband went to check the pager, something was rattling around in it. Thinking it may be broken, he went back to the desk to check. Hewas told it as fine and we had been told 90 minutes and it had only been 70. This was a celebration for my son's college graduation. After another half hour, when we noticed large groups who arrived after us were being called, we checked again. Lo and behold, our pager WAS faulty. Gave us another one and we waited another 15 minutes. Now we have waited over 2 hours and why didn't we leave, you ask? Because it was Saturday night and we had already invested the time. So, on we go to check again...and find out that our table had been given away by accident! The manager kept apologizing and telling us we would be seated in 10 minutes and to pick 4 appetizers for free for as soon as we sat down. We stood in the lobby and waited some more. I see the appetizers come out of the kitchen and we still have not been seated. The appetizers were sent back, but then the manager comes back, with the appetizers while we are standing around waiting and being pushed out of the way by people and says ""why don't you eat these right here while you are waiting?"" At this point, we explode! I have a pregnant woman and toddler who have waited for close to 3 hours and they want us to eat standing up in front of the whole restaurant? The manager was pissed that we refused this. He had also promised a free dessert by way of apology to my graduating son. Well, that never happened either. Overpriced, filthy, horrible customer service, the manager of this particular chain should be ashamed of themselves Because of this store, I will never eat at a Cheesecake Factory ever again. The only bright spot to the evening, was a wonderful server named Stella, who was very attentive. We did tip her of course, but I am a very generous tipper and I am afraid my anger at the manager ended up affecting Stella, which in hindsight, was not fair. But this is what happens. A bad manager affects the whole staff. I will be send ing a copy of this review to corporate.

206,Stephen C.,"Rochester, MI",11,36,8.0,3.0,2012-08-20,I like the Cheesecake Factory. Although you will never feel good  about yourself after eating there. All of the food is very heavy -- even the salads!  The cheesecake is awesome. I can't say I can vouch for any of the other items on the menu. I have never been amazed by any entree dish here.  Expect to wait at least 20 minutes anytime you go. It is also a very noisy restaurant which can be frusterating. The best time to come here is after 11:00PM -- the kitchen is still open and you don't have to deal with the noise or the wait.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=140,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.9880000000000004,3.3600000000000003

I got the Grilled Chicken and it came with three pieces of chicken and a small spoonful of rice! I wish I had maybe 2 pieces of chicken and then more rice. Three pieces of chicken is just WAY to much meat for one plate! That is literally how much chicken I eat in a week! I ate the pineapple upside cheesecake for dessert and it was SOOOO GOOD! I would so get that piece again!  Our waiter was excellent and kept checking on us which was really great. However, when we first got into the restaurant we were told it would be a 5-10 min wait but the Host actually forgot about us and it wasn't till about 20 mins in that he realized he never sat us! He was sitting same sized group people that came in later before us! It was very frustrating. When I went to the restroom and found out how messy and gross it was, also no toliet paper in some of the stalls, i went to bring it to their attention. The four people that were just hanging around the front desk just looked at me like a deer caught in headlights.

210,Chris P.,"Hudson, MA",2,26,,2.0,2012-09-02,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory today for the first time. I was curious to see what all the hype was about. I was very underwhelmed.  I ordered the chicken burrito, it should have been called the rice burrito. It was 90% plain white bland rice. It had 1 chicken breast in it, the chicken wasn't seasoned, it was very bland. In the vegetables, they actually served me the skin of the onion, which is inedible.  Our food took a long time to show up. Our waitress was MIA most of the meal. No one followed up with us after our meal was served to ask how it was. It took a long time to finally get out check.

The restaurant itself is very large, almost cavernous, with lots of seating and great ambience. I felt like I was in a roman palace! (I was dining by myself, and they still generously offered me a nice large table and seat). However, this place is a tad too popular. The parking is a nightmare. I almost got run over on the way in. Nothing was going to keep me from those delicious smells coming from inside. My waiter was a helpful little guy. I've never seen a waiter so passionate about his menu. He was actually making me a little uncomfortable with his excitement. I started with some delicious appetizers: Roadside Sliders, Avocado Egg-rolls, Fried Mac n Cheese and Crab Cakes. ALL VERY GOOD. I especially want to give a shout out to the Avocado Egg-rolls (I wanted to try more selections). For my entree, I ordered the Steak Diane. Pretty good, but I thought the steak could have been juicer. I should have got the Fillet Mignon... I was feeling pretty full and told the waiter (little devil) that I would probably be skipping desert. He INSISTED on showing the ""desert demo"". A nice way of tempting the customer. How could I resist? So I ate a Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake while I was there. YUM! I also ordered the Key Lime Cheesecake and the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake to go. I had intended to eat the cakes the next day, but the temptation took over me and I ended up eating one on the way home and one later that night on the couch.

I've been many times but my favorite experience was going here in the fall and eating my entire serving of Eggs Benedict (they have huge portions, but I was pregnant at the time).  I recently went on a weeknight at 8:30 and there was not wait (thank goodness). We munched on the bread before our orders were taken and let me say that the dark brown bread is really good. I want to take some home with me every time!  My normal choice is either a salad or a sandwich. The entrees are a little pricey (though again, the portions are quite large). Their salads are really good but I chose some kind of Southwestern/Californian chicken sandwich with avocado on a crusty Italian bread with sweet potato fries. Honestly, this sandwich was pretty good and no, I didn't eat the whole thing and brought half home to my husband.  When cheesecake is on the dessert menu, I don't usually order it except here at it's namesake. I've had several different kinds here- the original with strawberries, the red velvet cake, the tuxedo, the dulce de leche, the chocolate mousse, the brownie, the Godiva, etc. However, I really think they should have a dessert choice that features small slices of a few kinds (maybe three) in addition to a huge slice of just one flavor. Maybe CF could choose their most popular flavors or the customer could choose. I want to try everything and have small plates like tapas everywhere! At this location, I've never had a bad waiter/waitress and the restaurant and bathrooms are always spotless. I like the outdoor seating, too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=100,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.7359999999999998,3.4800000000000004

I digress.  I typically have no problem snagging a seat at the bar and ordering food.  The bartenders and extremely efficient, friendly, and polite to all customers regardless of whether or not you order booze.  If you want a Diet Coke and order an appetizer, you are treated with the same amount of respect as if you ordered a bottle of wine and a steak dinner.   My personal favorite is the Skinnylicious Mexican Chicken Lettuce Wraps that are served in bib cup lettuce ""bowls"".  It's messy to eat, but the salsa has a significant kick to it (me gusta!) and overall, it's a great meal and plenty for just one person.  And it's under $10 so it's totally reasonable.

I mean, the Cheesecake's food is all right, but to me it's not worth waiting 2 hours (or even an hour) for. There seems to be a lot of hoopla about the Cheesecake Factory in general, and I kinda don't get why. Maybe it's because--to their credit--they have a menu option for everyone. Vegetarian, heavy meal, light meal, meat, fish, salads, you name it.  Their Sunday brunch is great--in fact, if you don't want to wait forever to get a table, I'd suggest going here for Sunday brunch before the Natick Mall opens, have your brunch, and then go shopping. Beat the rush. If you get a booth here during busy hours, you're in luck. The booth seating is great for conversation and provides a buffer from the restaurant (when the restaurant's going full-tilt, it gets pretty noisy and chaotic). On the other hand, if you get one of the tables in the middle of dining area during busy hours, you'll be yelling at your dining companions and competing with the conversations from neighboring tables.  The food is average to average-plus. I've tried a lot of different things on their menu, and my favorite lunch/dinner dish is the Tomato Basil Pasta.

I don't think I saw a ""family bathroom"", and I didn't have time to search for this changing table, as my little guy NEEDED to be changed asap. So I did so on the bathroom floor (in a stall) and what do you know, he shit right up his back. Lots of it. All over his onesie. Unfortunately, I left his spare clothes in our car, parked on the other side of the mall. No time to run all the way over there. So, diaper changed, poop-covered onesie stored in the bag, and the little man is shirtless and dressed in his pants - thank god I had a blanket at our table to swaddle him in.

Their menu is endless and I always try something new every time I go!  Food: This time I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. It's basically white rice with chicken and shrimp, with Thai curry sauce and coconut shredding. Delicious.  Service: I don't remember our waiter's name but he was alright. He was good till the very end. He gave us the bill, we looked at it, looks good, ok, charge! Gave it back to us and the bill amount increased. He had forgotten to add a side dish that we ordered. Granted, that we didn't notice it either however as a courtesy he still should've came and notified us what he was adding before automatically charging it on our credit card! I thought that was not right at all so that is why they deserve two stars for my recent experience! Not to mention two weeks ago, I had ordered strawberry shortcake for take out and when I opened the container there was a small cockroach under the biscuits. I quickly took it back (which was no more than ten minutes) and the manager came and said ""That's weird. This never happens."" I felt like she was accusing me instead of being apologetic. I don't think I would put a cockroach in in my own food, what do I get out of it? She asked if I wanted new biscuits.

We were missing one of our dishes and he didn't even realize it until the end of the meal because he never came back to check on us! I told him just to make sure we weren't charged for the dish and all we got was a pathetic apology. He was just so slow and acted like he didn't even want to be there.

Leonard, Howard, Sheldon, and Raj. So I figured as I love cheese cake and the place gets a bit of publicity from The Big Bang Theory. I would give it a shot! As a major yelper it slipped my mind to even look them up before we went. Boy I wish I had checked it out. So let me just give an entire meal and post meal summary. So it started out after the love and I's trip to Natick Mall we were super excited to go to the Cheesecake Factory. I love cheesecake... Like LOVE cheesecake. So after our shopping bout we ended up at our lunch destination. Our waiter was relatively nice. He was prompt with refilling drinks which was nice, but that was all for nothing when he would grab my half full cup without saying a word and run off at lightning speed. Okay so cut him some slack he's just doing his job. But when comes back to give my drink back he just runs off, even though I tell him thank you he doesn't acknowledge that I even said it. ( Its extremely important to note that I don't say thank you for personal gain or for better service. I have the utmost respect for waiters and waitresses and I know from experience that a simple thank you can turn a day around). That much I can look past when it comes to reviewing an restaurant. The food is really what matters the most.  So I guess the part you've been waiting for. When I tell you about the food poisoning I got. So our food came out and it looked very good and well presented. Which was expected as this place was a little on the pricier side. My lovely lady got herself some steak tacos. Everything appeared to be already pre cooked and really just thrown together from the fridge or something and heated up a bit. Which was extremely disappointing. Me on the other hand. My Fish and Chips lunch looked very good. I remember a few bites in saying I wasn't so sure about this fish. God I wish I was more sure and had it returned because I then spent almost a full 24 hours after that throwing up every hour on the hour with the most vigorous case of the runs happening simultaneously. Now I suppose this could of been a super stomach bug. But with the way things went down it seemed doubtful. I don't generally get sick often and keep my body and tip top working order.. So yeah I was disappointed... OH LOOK, HERE COMES SOME MORE. If you're from the Worcester area you'll get that reference: love business TV commercial. Anyways... Onto the cheesecake. As mentioned I love cheesecake and wow was I NOT BLOWN AWAY AT ALL. This was the worst cheesecake I've ever had in my life. It was Lukewarm and falling apart.

We ordered a modified appetizer that didn't come out right but whatever we dealt with it. We put in an order for some food I put in a salad in which I specified I needed it modified and no wontons etc. and date got his normal meal. When My food arrived the salad was no where near modified. it came just as it was on the menu me being a vegetarian I sent it back and asked for it to please be modified as I asked for it if it was possible. they left my dates food. and we waited for my salad. his food got colder and colder. finally my salad arrives. It comes with meat and no dressing on the side at all. I just looked at my date and said ok now what. The bartenders are mumbling to themselves and looking and annoyed when I tell them I am so sorry but there's meat on the salad I cant eat it that way. They start complaining to the servers about me to the point the servers from the service bar start looking my way it was embarrassing. Never mind the fact that the manager comes over and he SCOLDS ME!!! for having to the salad over again! I don't know which one was worst! he tells me he doesn't want to make it again if its not gonna be right. This is 10 minutes after my salad has already gone back to the kitchen so I am thinkin they are already working on the new one. But the manager tall skinny guy talked to me in such a horrible manner I just said to him nicely. Don't worry if the salad is not being made  ill just grab something somewhere else or later no big deal. He says okay ill check the kitchen. Comes back 10 minutes later I am thinkin he has my salad.

18,Jess D.,"Farmington, ME",50,12,1.0,1.0,2016-08-06,"I was super disappointed a few days ago when my husband and I took my one year old there for dinner. I'm 8 1/2 months pregnant and just wanted a nice dinner out with my family before our new bundle arrived. We went on a night where it wasn't busy but our waiter still seemed to want to rush and brush us off.  He took mine and my husbands drink order and then tried to rush off before I got a chance to tell him my daughter would also like a drink! When we ordered our food I told him I have a gluten allergy, I wanted a gluten free burger cooked medium and fries, simple right? Wrong. He said ""a burger with blue cheese?"" Um no just a regular burger with regular cheese and a gluten free bun. When all our food finally came my burger was not on a gluten free bun, it was sent back and I was told a new one would take less than 10 min. Even the manager came over and apologized and asked if I'd like a salad in the meantime, I declined. More than 10 minutes passes, my husband and daughter are both finished with their meal, mind you my one year old was being exceptionally good but we all know that may not last too long! The waiter came back over and apologized again and said it wouldn't be long so I decided to order my daughter a scoop of vanilla ice cream to keep her happy, well my food finally came and it was WRONG AGAIN!! Wrong burger and it was very rare not medium, if I weren't so pregnant it wouldn't have been as big a deal. I looked at my husband told him I was all set and to get the bill, I wasn't going to make my daughter, who STILL hadn't received her ice cream wait any longer. My pregnancy hormones took over and I had to get up and leave. I told my husband to make sure they didn't charge us for my meal or the ice cream. Well they took my meal off and offered my husband a free piece of cheesecake which he declined because my daughter and I were waiting in the car but they left her ice cream on the bill! Needless to say I left in tears and still hungry! They should have comped our whole meal or offered us a gift card.

That to me was a little confusing, Being that I was there first and waiting. Yet again I waited. When the man was done I moved in front of the counter. A woman walked and in started to place her order Ronny C not intervene she realized it and stopped self then said for me to go ahead.Ronny C then took my name and found my order. He said its $16.00 I handed a 20 dollar bill to him. My $4.00 change he placed in on the side of the register and went along to service the women. I stopped him and said with customer service you are never to put someone's money that placed money into your hand on the table it's very rude and very disrespectful. He was shocked!

57,Chandra J.,"Dallas, TX",153,225,162.0,4.0,2017-01-28,"Was craving a burger and had heard for years that Cheesecake Factory had some of the best burgers! So, a few friends and I headed there last Saturday night and enjoyed ourselves. We had to wait for about 45 minutes for a table, but it was well worth it as we were sat at a large round table in a quieter section of the restaurant. Our waiter quickly came over amd took our drink orders. He was very nice, brought us some of their extra wheat and sourdough bread, and just overall made us feel very welcomed. As always Cheesecake Factory does not fall short when it comes to their food selection and portion sizes. I was so happily overwhelmed by the number of appetizers, salads, entrees, sandwiches, and pastas they had listed on their menu. I came in with the idea that I wanted a burger, but their salmon and chicken dishes were calling me. However, I stuck to my plan and got their mushroom burger.  This burger was one of the best burgers I've ever had. It was big, but not too big and stuffed with crisp lettuce, tomato, grilled onions and mushrooms, and a sweet and tangy aoli sauce. I did not want the burger to stoo, but unfortunately my stomach had other plans and stopped it for me. I ended up taking half of it home along with the broccoli that I ordered as a side (i love that they did not charge me for subsituting the side like a lot of restaurants do). The minus one star came from the cheesecake as it was not as rich and decadent as I remember it being. Definitely fell flat in the taste and size department, but still had the $8 price tag.

These were basically the frozen pot stickers that you can buy at your local supermarket. Doughy and filled with a mushy slimy chicken glump.  The loaded tater tots. I had one and one was too many. They were just a tasteless lump of mushy mashed potato (where was the ""loaded"" part) and the sour cream was literally frozen! There was a huge glump of frozen sour cream in the middle of the bowl and the rest was just a thin liquid. Ick!  The last item was a crab(less) cakes. Seriously. Where was the crab? Was it replaced with bread and bread crumbs?! No taste and just a mushy mess. No thank you!  The guys couldn't leave without have a piece of cheesecake.

Both said it wasn't something they HAD to have again.  3 apps. Two glasses of wine. 1 draft beer. And 2 mojitos. Total. Too much! $102 bucks and not including the tip.

23,Sparky S.,"Medford, MA",2,40,16.0,1.0,2017-07-18,"My worst service experience ever at a Cheesecake factory. can't help post this for others to learn from our experience and go in prepared. We were out there to celebrate a birthday and had planned and pre-ordered the cake as a surprise. We came ahead before our dinner and checked with the bakery to make sure our cake was ready. Later we asked our server privately(to maintain the surprise) to bring in the cake at the end of our meal. Now this is what happened: 1). After our appetizers r done, the lady from the bakery comes over to the table asking if we ordered the cake n wanted it to be served. so there goes the surprise down the drain!!.we just stared in shock and said no. I then went to the server n told him about this and all I got was, ""I don't know what the bakery lady was doing at your table""... that's it. not even an apology for ruining our night. 2). next was the service nightmare. Our entrées r here and the server hasn't cleared the empty bread basket, the appetizer dishes, side plates. we just push things around to make room for the entrées. two in the group were sharing a entrée and we mentioned it when we ordered and all he brought was the entree plate. we had to ask twice for him to bring a plate for them to eat from, and then he just got 1!! and had the nerve to joke saying ""we r making him do multiple runs to the table"".... seriously!!! just do your job properly in the first place, so that we don't have to keep reminding you of what needs to be done. we ask him to clear the dirty side plates, still no action. just walks away. Towards the end of the meal, the server comes over and asks if he could take our plates out of the way, this is while we were still working through our meal! we asked him to clear the appetizer dishes which were still on the table. he said ok and walked away as if ""it's not my job"". when he later came to clear the dishes, we told him to clear the table before he brought the cake(now that there is no surprise with the cake, we could just tell him what he should have known n done in general). he still left the dirty appetizer side plates on the table. we reminded him again when he was walking by...just an ok, no action. After 15mins of wait, he then just brought the cake n we had to make room pushing the dirty dishes to the side of the table while they sang the birthday song.he tossed some new side plates for us to share the cake, we had to ask him again to bring some spoons!! r we supposed to dig in with our hands!? we again asked him to clear the dirty appetizer dishes, all he did was pick one and leave. he comes around in few mins, tosses an empty cake box and the check. ...did we ask for the check?NO!! coz we were still working on the cake on our plates. anyways, we paid our check, left a tip. noticed that they did not add the price of the cake, thought maybe they were making up for their goof-up and it was on the house. courtesy sake we asked to confirm n learnt that this was not the case. an argument ensured between the server and the bakery on who was supposed to charge the cake to the check. finally paid for the cake at the counter. mentioned to the server again on how disappointed we were that they ruined our surprise n all we got was ""you know that mistakes happen"". Yes, we know!! but doesn't one appolgize for it!! anyways we left without asking for a manager (who was never to be seen anywhere when all this happened), we didn't want to stick around anymore n further ruin the birthday for the person in the group. Seriously the worst service I ever saw. will still go to other cheesecake factories....but never ever to the one at Natick Mall!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=40,3.24,2.96,2.96,2.5640000000000005,3.0720000000000005

24,Summer P.,"Natick, MA",0,12,6.0,2.0,2017-08-13,"Totally disappointing lunch. First I'd like to say the greeters and our server were top notch. That's where my positives end. Our table was in the back by the bathrooms (which were very clean) which is cool, they were busy, but the sparkling water glass (wine glass) was filthy, there was a hair on my napkin, crumbs (not ours) on an appetizer plate, and the whole time there were fruit flies or gnats flying around our heads, it was super distracting. I ordered the veggie burger, and kids Mac n cheese for my kid (I didn't eat anything else so I won't comment on the rest). The ""burger"" was a patty of flavorless rice mush. Of which I took one bite (sans the mcdonalds-esq dyed pickles I couldn't stomach the look of them), I have never had such a bland mushy veggie burger. I get it, it's veggies and rice, but even if I could do the mush, there was zero flavor.  I was very disappointed it fell far far below my expectations of a lunch plate.  I didn't eat it so it was comped, unfortunately I was starving so my mood was a negative 11. The child's Mac n cheese was very bland and greasy, I stirred and stirred and couldn't get any ""cheese"" to stick to the noodles. Poor kid forced herself a bite, then I tried it and completely understood her aversion, again zero flavor, not even a salty flavor, no cheese flavor, it was kind of ridiculous. We got up and went next door to wait while the rest of our party finished (sandwich and salad) which they seemed ok with, eating half of (no to-go containers so obviously it wasn't delish). The water tasted funny. This place has really let its standards slip. We contemplated the cheesecake but I was sort of disheartened by the whole experience and just wanted to be done. You know when you spend all morning running errands and you just want a yummy lunch? Yeah that's all I wanted. I hate to nitpick but omg I was so sad I left hungry, it used to be such a great place. Kudos for not charging me for the ""burger"", but 2/4 meals edible isn't exactly a good enough record for me to come again. Our server was a peach though, above standard service on her end (why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1)!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=40,3.24,2.98,2.98,,3.0840000000000005

They have completely outgrown this space and should move to a bigger place. Knowing this  my wife and I with our 2 year old called ahead from Speen Street which is about 5 minutes away and asked how long the wait was. The girl that answered the phone said the place was empty and we would get right in. She even went as far to say the bar was empty. Upon arriving 6 minutes later after getting lucky finding a parking spot not far away I walked into the restaurant. There must have been 50 people in there! I got up to the desk and said I just called and you said the place was empty? What's the deal? She said it got busy and can change in here quickly. I said in 6 minutes??? She was a typical sensitive millennial girl so of coarse she ran away upset to get her manager rather than tackle a situation on her own. Out comes the manager and I said I called 6 minutes ago and she said the place was empty now it's a wait? He said sorry I don't know what to say? I said you people lie on the phone to get people in here and that's not right. It's impossible that it filled this quickly. He smirked and said sorry rather than fixing the problem. He's a horrible manager and deserves to be fired. I told him I would Yelp it and he didn't seem to care.

42,Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",161,1505,24566.0,4.0,2017-10-15,"My experiences at the Cheesecake Factory always range. Even though it should be, nothing is ever exactly consistent.  Well, the real reason for only four stars versus five is because of the chefs. Unfortunately, the chefs at the Natick location have a few lessons to learn still... maybe they are just less experienced than those in Chestnut Hill or maybe it was an off day. Just to note, cheeseburgers should never ever be coated all around the edges with cheese. It looked like they actually had the nerve to place at least three pieces of cheese on my burger. I actually had to take my silverware and get some of it off, because it was just way too much. I am willing to give them another go though.  With that said, service all around was spectacular. Meghan was very friendly and attentive to our table. She was consistent and efficient, which was great. The host was also fabulous. Even with the crowds and crowds of people waiting around at the Cheesecake Factory, she was very efficient and organized in keeping everyone moving along efficiently. Seating is comfortable and overall the decor of the Cheesecake Factory is phenomenal. It's like a palace in a sense.  The complimentary bread is delicious and the quality of the food is very good. I had a small issue with much too much cheese on my burger, but overall, my meal was still pretty good.  I would come in the future as I have frequented the Cheesecake Factory over the years, mainly on holidays. We have stopped coming here on holidays due to the congestion and long, long wait times (which are present very frequently at nearly all the Cheesecake Factory locations).

(how freaking rude is that?)  Ok so the food finally comes out it's well past 9pm.  People eat.  We ask for boxes and to order cheese cake to go as well as get a check and she ghosted on us.  we waited until 10:15 including asking other servers to send our server to us (they did not)  I go to the mens room and I see her just chatting to another server.  Come on is this amateurs night? She comes back finally.  (Sans check cheesecake and boxes)  Ask's us what we want for cheese cake again?  She finally brings it, brings the check (obviously not split as we requested) and boxes.  Finally, pay and get out of there at 10:30.  I wasted 3 and a half hours in your establishment.  I usually tip 20-30% but this time I tipped your server 8 cents.  So if one of them was upset about it that was me.  You don't treat well-paying customers like that.  The only reason this review has two stars is that my dinner was fantastic.  Needless to say the four of us will never come back to a cheese cake factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=20,3.2,2.96,2.96,,3.0560000000000005

Keep our drinks filled, checked in with us the appropriate amount of time, we never felt we had to look for her.

The starting bread...perfect as always, it's unlimited, so don't hesitate to ask for me, but don't fill up if you ordered and entree, unless you are ok with taking leftovers home. They are consistent with the burgers and fries. You can customize them, from temperature to toppings. The toasted buttered bun, YUM!
