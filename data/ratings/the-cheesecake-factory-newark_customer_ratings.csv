The wait was 30 minutes so we took our pager and sat at the bar. As it turns out we just drank and ate our meals right there!

86,Sean M.,"Odessa, DE",16,8,,1.0,2012-07-13,"I have been slowly trying to ween my family off chain restaurants and my latest experience at this one is a good reason why.  We went here on a Thursday night for a dessert treat.  Something about and $7 slice of fatty cheesecake appeals to my wife and kids while my wallet silently weeps. Service: for once we didn't have to wait 2 to 3 hours to be shuttled in a cavern of restaurant.  (Everyone table's conversation is amplified, jumbled and combined into a unpleasant roar.)  We sat down, ordered, and somehow it took almost 10 minutes to slice $21 worth of cheesecake (3 slices) and bring it to the table. It may sound petty, but if I am ordering around 3000 calories of cheesecake at a price that could feed a family of four for dinner, you better ridiculous white pants/shirt combo in high gear and serve those slices of cake quickly. Attention to detail: The waitress came back to see if my family were enjoying thier fat-pills and she boxed and bagged my daughter's leftover slice of cake.  This morning, my daughter naturally wants her cake for breakfast!  (I'm guilty of leftover chinese food for breakfast) Now what reminds me of stoner McDonalds workers spitting in the food was the layer of macaroni noodles crushed into the base of her leftover cake????  Really?  Price:  For reheated frozen food, this place is a joke!   Overall: a perfect match for Christiana Mall and its consumers.  The only positive thing about my visit is that I no longer have to hear my kids suggest going there ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newark?start=80,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436

92,R. K.,"Broomall, PA",0,36,,4.0,2012-10-24,"I've been to this location and other Cheesecake Factory locations multiple times, and this service has been consistent across the board, as well as the food. You can get stuck in an hour plus waiting time, if you aren't careful. I would say lunch would be the best time to avoid that or a later dinner, but I have seen the lunch wait get a little long...maybe not an hour wait though. The good news is, you can stalk patrons in the bar area, as that seating is first come first serve, and I've had decent luck doing that at other locations.  Also, the portions are very large. The lunch pizza and salad is VERY filling, as well as the pasta, and Renee's Special (half of a turkey or chicken salad sandwich, a salad, and the soup of the day. If the soup doesn't sound like one you want you can substitute for fries). My only ""gripe"" has been that the last couple of times I have been the caesar salad has a lemony taste to it, even my mom noticed it. Not sure why that it is.... People really shouldn't complain about the calorie count or the price of the cheesecake. First of all, it's at a restaurant, so anything here is going to contain more calories than if you made it yourself, it's the reason you shouldn't eat it every day! Is $7 steep for a price of cheesecake, I guess that depends on who you are asking. If you had one of their drinks at dinner, you probably paid about that for it. Basically, you wouldn't pay that much if it wasn't delicious.

Cheesecake Factory's, like many chains, are very similar in all of their locations. Christiana is no different, except perhaps a little bit smaller than others. I've been about three or four times now, and every server has been very good and very patient. I feel like the food at Cheesecake is so consistent. I really can't remember ever having anything bad at any location. I've always gone for lunch, and it has never been more than half full and so we are seated right away. There is also an ample amount of outside tables, but it's right next to the entrance to a busy food court in the mall.  Highly recommend this place, very solid option for lunch or dinner. Like I said, you can pick almost anything that sounds good for you, and it will be delicious. I tend to go for their pastas and sandwiches. Most recently I've had their cuban sandwich. It's their version on the traditional, but very tasty. Historically I haven't been a fan of sweet potato fries, but theirs were awesome! Perfectly crispily cooked. I'm also not big on dessert, but their red velvet cheesecake is the only thing that changes my mind. I think the only downside to this location is the parking. The lot is fairly shallow right by their entrance, and so you often have to park far away. Once you consider the portion sizes of their meals though, you'll want to park far away to walk it off!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newark?start=40,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003

Seafood to tacos? Just to expansive for the cooks to get anything 100% spot on with cooking techniques and flavor/seasoning. 2.) they have a dish there that is the most caloric pasta dish overall out of all the nation's chain restaurants. Ummm...hello?!?! 3.) their cheesecake, while yummy, should have a warning that each slice is a MINIMUM of 1,100 calories. 4.) the service is subpar with many young kids that are more interested in flirting with one another and checking their smartphones than effectively waiting on tables. 5.) Salads are overdressed to the point of being slimey and mush. I just don't have the energy to go on. It is a chain restaurant that's main goal is to cash in on as many customers a night as possible.

108,Sporadic W.,"Charlotte, NC",157,377,1149.0,3.0,2015-02-20,"Went for happy hour from 4-6pm yesterday. Appetizers and drinks on the happy hour menu are $5 and small plates range in price from $4-7. Our table ordered mojitos, cosmopolitans, skinny girl martinis, fried Mac & cheese balls, burgers, buffalo chicken blast, artichoke heart, bread & butter is complimentary, and I think there was something else for happy hour, but don't remember. Burgers were received well. Buffalo blast was mediocre, it's not chicken wings, apparently the chicken it shredded and mixed with batter or put inside a wonton wrap and then fried, so there isn't much chicken. Table favorite hands down was the macaroni and cheese balls with marinara sauce. Everyone at the table likes artichoke and we were all sorely disappointed when it came out; it looked old roasted and dry, and was equally bland and very chewy. We sent it back to the kitchen.  Drinks. Mojito had lots of mint and was delicious, so we ended up ordering a second. Skinny girl martini, didn't try it, but the person who ordered did not mention anything about it, but decided to order a second, so I'm assuming it was also good. Cosmo, the person who ordered this liked it, but it was a bit of a fiasco. The drink came with the customary salt around the edges which was not requested, it was sent back, they then poured it from the salted glass to another glass hence taking some of the salt with it, which was again returned and remade in a new glass. That item was also order a second time. Desserts, unfortunately are not a part of the happy hour menu at all. So the slices are pretty much $8/9 each, which is fairly ridiculous. I know most of them are specialties, but still a lot per slice. One friend ordered the lime/lemon meringue cheesecake, which was almost gone before we left. She loved it. I ordered Chris's outrageous cheesecake which was equally delicious and took half home with me, and our other friend had the strawberry cheese, which she said was good as well.  We all would definitely return for happy hour, the happy hour menu is both impressive and extensive, unlike other restaurants that just have 3-5 choices, is tasty, and service is friendly. Even though we returned items to the kitchen, there wasn't any backlash. Our server remained professional and courteous, even if she was thinking something else.

The wait times, however, can be a legitimate buzzkill as CF doesn't offer call ahead or reserved seating.  The waiting area is essentially nonexistent and has horrible flow.  Also, the Christiana Mall location does get pretty slammed, which is a common feature  among most other CF locations. If you get there before 4 pm on a high volume day, the wait time should be pretty bearable. The food quality is not too shabby; the overwhelming menu offers something for just about everybody except for Anthony Bourdain wannabes, and who wants to break bread with blowhards like that anyway? I enjoy the grilled steak tacos, guacamole, and dynamite shrimp. My boyfriend tears up the dynamite shrimp and is somewhat fond of the bang bang chicken and shrimp.

You have to wait long to be seated, and long for your food. Honestly, when you go to a good restaurant, this is expected. If possible, make reservations if you don't want to wait. I think they only do reservations during weekdays. Call ahead to be sure. Also, good parking is hard to get! The beginning of the parking lot is always filled.

The waffles are fluffy and while they don't have a traditional chicken and waffles dish my creative friend simply ordered chicken tenders to go with. The mini crab balls delicious.

They have everything!   Seriously....my dad and I were at the mall for the Apple Store and we both wanted different things and this is the perfect place to eat.  We got a nice table outside on the patio, which either has a view of the mall entrance or parking lot but honestly you can do some nice people watching.   My dad got an eggplant dish which was delicious.  I got the southern fried catfish which left something to be desired but the sides of mashed potatoes were amazing.  We also split spinach dip, which was really tasty.  I took home a piece of the salted caramel cheesecake which I ate over the next two days.   You really can't go wrong here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newark,3.56,3.3,3.3,,3.4040000000000004

64,Deanna J.,"Newark, DE",32,5,,3.0,2017-11-28,"Everyone knows the Cheesecake Factory has great food and a good variety. That being said- they just got rid of the best food on the menu- the Crab Wontons!!! I am so disappointed as this was my favorite dish, as well as my friends and families. We will definitely miss it!    Also, compared to other Cheesecake factories I have been to (King of Prussia, Cherry Hill, Baltimore) this one unfortunately lacks more in good service/ food quality.  It also tends to have a long wait, I'd def recommend a reservation in advance!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newark,3.48,3.31,3.31,,3.378

59,Taylor B.,"Greenwich Township, NJ",3,2,,5.0,2017-12-28,"It was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory. The wait time for my nephew and I was about 15 minutes, which really isn't bad at all. It was very busy in there, so I honestly thought it would've been longer. Our waitress was nice, but often times disappeared for times, but again, it was really busy, so that was fine. I was told by a family friend that the portions weren't huge, but when my plate came out, it was HUGE. I had no idea how I'd finish it, haha. The food was SO good. I got the Parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans. My nephew got an omelette that came with toast and home fries. Again, huuuuge plate for him too. Of course, you can't go to the Cheesecake Factory and not have cheesecake. We took ours to go. I'm now just eating mine (Godiva chocolate cheesecake) and am in love. If you're a chocolate lover, I highly recommend it.  The only ""downfall"" were the prices, but I definitely didn't think it would be on the cheaper side. For my nephew and I, our meal totaled about $60 + tip: for 2 entrees, two Shirley temples, two slices of cheesecake, and Mac and cheese (had to try it, heard it was a must)  I would definitely come here again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newark,3.72,3.34,3.34,,3.4920000000000004
