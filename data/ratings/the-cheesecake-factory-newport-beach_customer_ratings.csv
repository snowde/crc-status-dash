342,Amien P.,"San Francisco, CA",42,93,,4.0,2012-01-19,"One of my fav places to eat at FI usually there's a wait, you can always see if the little patio with two tables is available, great views.  I usually get the soup and sandwhich combo which is a steal or the factory burger mmm. portions are huge, just get the rest togo. and there you go a midnight snack or dinner.

294,Christina P.,"Tustin, CA",90,244,102.0,2.0,2012-02-27,"Hmmm... I thought I already wrote a review for The Cheesecake Factory and how I couldn't bring myself to finish my meal, or order another entree because there was a piece of saran wrap in my pasta... I took a bite, and felt something slimy in my mouth that I couldn't chew. I thought it might be an onion, but it was a piece of plastic - gross! The great thing about this incident is it shows how involved the manager's are in their service. The server apologized and offered to have a new dish made for me. I had lost my appetite, so I declined. Then the manager stopped by to apologize and make sure I was okay. She offered me a slice of cheesecake, I declined because I had lost faith for the night in anything that hit the table. What gets me is that they didn't remove the pasta from the bill. I ate less than half of it before I stumbled upon my little surprise, and had the dish taken back to the kitchen. I didn't realize I would have to pay for someone else's mistake. Other than that one awful encounter. The food is usually spot on, the service is typically okay, and the portions are oversized - good and bad thing in this world that keeps getting fatter. I probably won't go back for a long time, because there are so many better places out there. Oh, another negative - when my cousin was six years old, he ordered a virgin daquiri. They served him a regular daquiri, and when he told his parents he felt funny, they sipped his drink to find that there was alcohol in there. SERIOUSLY? You didn't notice the drink smelled like alcohol when you dropped it off in front of a SIX YEAR OLD? The manager apologized, obviously. But again, they didn't take the drink off the bill and made them pay for something that could have seriously gotten the restaurant in trouble.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=300,3.64,3.58,3.58,2.7600000000000007,3.6040000000000005

291,Donald S.,"Newport Beach, CA",590,448,25.0,3.0,2012-03-22,"Ya gotta eat somewhere, right!?!? This was my ""somewhere"" a few weeks ago...I'm almost fully recovered now. I'm just kidding around (as far as you know), I probably didn't have any real problems with the food at the Fashion Island Factory. That's largely because I didn't order much of anything...between all the kids scampering around the joint, the super loud and hyper after work conversations fueled by too many mediocre cocktails and the strangely disconcerting 44 chapter book that they laughingly call the ""menu"", I pretty much didn't have an appetite. I know...crazy! We met several members of The Beautiful Carin's family, who happened to drop by scenic Newport Beach to help her celebrate her birthday! It was an interesting dinner, right from the outset. The waiter kept pressing our group to order...""I'll give you few more minutes"" as if it were an imperative that we be ready to spout our requests the moment he reappeared. In his 8 - 10 return visits to our table, we weren't ever ready. Honestly though, we are the customers...Simmer down Jethro...we'll order when we're damn good and ready...I know your CF waiters handbook says to move us along in order to ""optimize"" the table...but we are catching up with family and this is going to take a little time. Jethro finally resorted to essentially ignoring us (and I can't say I really blamed him), so he was ill prepared when we flagged him down and began peppering him requests. We want red wine...I want scotch...we want silverware...we want napkins...we want child's meals...we want salads...we want cheesecake...we want...well, you get the drift. Add in the fact that almost no one at the table was able to order any item from the ""menu"" without altering it in some way (really...17,374 items on the menu and we could not find anything we didn't want to change...well, except me...frenched fries and scotch for Donald, por favor). Not much of what we wanted showed up in a coherent manner...my fries (the only thing I ordered...hey, I've been to CF before...lots of them...I know what I want and, more importantly, what I don't want) showed up way before I got my cocktail. Water didn't show up until the 3rd or 4th request was made...tableware didn't show up until after food began to arrive...condiments never arrived (we finally took them from a waiter station). Kiddo meals showed up one at a time over a period of many minutes (and anyone who has ever dined with kids knows that when one kid gets their victuals, all the kids had better be getting their victuals). I'm pretty sure Jethro viewed us as a ""table from hell"" and we probably were...although we are fantastic tippers and he would have done well to respect that fact. Then again, I don't generally wear my lapel pin that says ""Take good care of me...I'm a big tipper!"" Still, CF sort of redeemed themselves with dessert...after all, this is a factory devoted to cheesecake...and god knows I love cheesecake! I grabbed my newly arrived fork and dove in...for exactly 2 bites...we probably should have ordered more cheesecake. I've made my bi-annual (as opposed to semi-annual) visit to the factory, so I'm probably good for a while. Although, since I only got 2 bites of cheesecake, I could be talked into dropping by again for a slice...as long as you're buying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=300,3.56,3.55,3.55,2.8280000000000003,3.5540000000000003

Meh, I thought it was pretty terrible to say the least. Everything they serve is so rich and heavy in flavor. I had the avocado spring rolls, shrimp and chicken gumbo, and fettucini with chicken and sun dried tomatoes. The avocado spring rolls were the best of the three, but I couldn't stand the richness. I ate 2 spring rolls and a third of my shrimp and chicken gumbo and I was full, heavy full and not in a good way. The shrimp and chicken gumbo lacked any spicyness although it was described on the menu as such. The shrimp was not fresh as it was hard and dry. Fettucini was oily, cheesy, and chicken dry. Totally unsatisifed and would not go back for the food. The decor is nothing special either. Turn up the lights and you'll see no artistic design or style.

Myself I love a lot on the menu. For example the Steak Diane (however you say it) and the lunch shepards pie.  What I love: Atmosphere is pretty nice. Nice view. Foods great! Don't love: Menu is wayyy too long, Appetizer section is several pages, as well as each entree area. Few pages of desserts etc. Hard to find the perfect thing with such a large menu, and it makes me think how fresh some things could be, if its so large they must prep much of it for the week etc. Also its a little pricy, my GF and me went for lunch, bill was 52 dollars, tipped an extra 10 bucks.

272,James P.,"San Diego, CA",174,42,52.0,1.0,2012-06-03,"The last time I remember, red velvet cheesecake would have RED velvet cake and cream cheese in between etc. My friend and I went in today to grab a slice of their famous red velvet cheesecake to go, just to be disappointed by disgusting cheesecake we ended up receiving. We walked in, and the cheesecakes were in the casing to the right of the restaurant. She's only tried the Original Cheesecake, so I told her ""Let's try the Red Velvet!"" We were sharing, so I asked for a slice of the red velvet cheesecake to go. I was rung up within a minute and received the cheesecake within the next two minutes. We brought it home and opened it up. Boy, it did not look like the red velvet I remembered. There are two layers of red velvet cake. Both layers were barely red or not red at all, but more brownish. We took a few bites and could barely swallow it. The cake itself was dry and the cream cheese in between the layers did not taste fresh at all. It seemed like the cake was made in advanced and was never put together until now? Or the whole cheesecake has been in the back refrigerator for a few days before they put it on the shelf. It was just awful. After a few bites, we ended up throwing 95% of the cheesecake in the trash. I expect more from The Cheesecake Factory. I've been here numerous times, and never have I received disgusting food/cheesecake like this before. The friend I was with, swears to never eat at Cheesecake Factory again (or at least this Fashion Island one).

On second visit we were seated by a friendly and chatty hostess. Then we sat, and we sat.........and we sat. We were chatting for 15 minutes and realised that we had not been approached by a server. We were not in a corner, there were a bunch of staff passing by us so we both tried to catch a waiter's eye for another 5 minutes. They were not slammed, they were reasonably busy but really not rushed off their feet. We decided to give them a few more minutes and ultimately decided to walk out. Not something I have done too often. Whilst I'm perfectly capable of getting up from my seat and approaching a waiter and asking for service, I don't think I should have to fight for attention in a restaurant.

The Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant in general so I was looking forward to eating. Our waitress, of course, was very polite and seated us quickly. It kind of seems like they're starting to change up their policy on the bread they give out. They used to bring it out immediately as soon as you sit down, but the last numerous times we've had to eventually ask for it once we saw they weren't going to bring it out. Anyway, I ordered my favorite dish which is the Luau Salad. When they brought it out to me I found a hair on my plate! I kindly asked the waitress for a new one and she quickly whisked it away, apologizing profusely. My husband had already gotten his food, which was also a sald, so I started eating his and we decided we might as well just share that since he wasn't going to eat it all. So I flagged down the waitress and told her to just cancel my order. Another waiter came over and offered to give us each a bowl of clam chowder on the house to make up for the hair debacle. I was even more impressed when the manager came over and offered his most sincere apology and offered to also give us an entree to take home on the house. I couldn't belive how much they bent over backwards to make up for something that wasn't a big deal. Everyone has hair and I'm sure I've eaten my fair share! But they were so polite, apologetic and eager to make it up to us which made me very happy. Most places won't go so far out of their way, but this place did, and I applaud them for it.

Its Spaghettini, Fresh Asparagus, Shiitake Mushrooms, Oven-Roasted Tomatoes and Parmesan in a Garlic Sauce.  I of course being a shrimp lover added that and got the lunch portion.  Even the lunch portion is big enough for two!  The pasta was cooked al dente and the flavor of the garlic sauce was delish. I could have ordered a cheesecake but since I didnt order from the skinnylicious menu I punished myself. Damn.  I so could have gone for their Red Velvet Cheesecake.  Next time I will pass on the pasta and go straight for the cheeesecake LOL! Eyes ~ So nice to see the ocean while dining!

290,Mary S.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,29,2.0,1.0,2012-10-15,"I must start by saying that the Cheesecakes and jambalaya, as well as the chicken and biscuits that I've had here are great.  This review is about the poorest service that I've ever received at a CCF in all of my days; and by all of my days I mean at least ten years.  My fiancée and I were starting to give up on chain restaurants because it seems as though they are really not giving two shizzes about their customers, but we had faith in the classic Factory. So we decided to go here one day for a late Sunday lunch, around 2 or so. It was unusually crowded for a Sunday at this time, so we waited about 40 minutes. Once we were finally seated, it took our dim witted server about ten minutes to come ask for our drink orders. Keep in mind, he was serving the table immediately next to us. Once he came to see us, he asked for our drinks and if we wanted bread (of course we do!). About ten minutes later he comes with our drinks and said that he forgot if we wanted bread or not. ""Yes please,"" I answered. Another few minutes go by and we finally get our bread, and order our food. I kid you not, we ordered a Chinese Chicken Salad and a taco plate.  FOURTT FIVE MINUTES LATER I have to remind him that we ordered a salad and tacos, and asked where they were. He said that someone should have brought it out already, and looked at us like it was our fault that no one brought us our food. First of all, its YOUR job to make sure that YOUR tables have been taken care of, not somebody else's. Second of all, WTF dude? I can't go make the food myself here, that's why I came and am paying you to do it. I'm tired. It's Sunday. totally unacceptable.  I have concluded that this kid is just totally unprepared and too incompetent to be a server on a Sunday lunch shift, possibly any shift at all, and if the management at this establishment doesn't figure that out soon, they will no longer have us, or any other paying patrons as customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=300,3.16,3.48,3.48,3.172,3.3520000000000008

395,Natalie M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,4,,2.0,2012-12-01,"I went there yesterday with two people. It was a busy Friday night, we went in at about 7:15. The hostess said it would be about a 30 minute wait - totally fine. It was busy. She gave us a pager and after 20 minutes, the pager went off. We gave her the pager and she asked us to stand in line behind a few other customers and assured us that a hostess would seat us in a minute. Someone else turned in their pager and got in line behind us as well. It was a good five minutes before a hostess came back and sat the people that got in line BEHIND us. I work in customer service and HATE crabby people that don't understand the nature of the business and that we literally do everything in our power to make the customer happy. BUT, to seat someone that got there after us (with the same number of people in their party as us - 3 people) is pretty ridiculous. Not to mention, we waited in line for another six or seven minutes until finally being called. WHY BUZZ THE PAGER IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEAT ME RIGHT AWAY?????  If you buzz the pager, we think we are about to get sat, so that is a lame system that you have there Cheesecake Factory! The server was very sweet, she passed us three times telling us she would be with us in a minute. No problem, I'm glad she acknowledged us and didn't just leave us to sit there waiting and wondering where our sever was. She took our drink orders and entree orders. I ordered a salad to start.

I ordered the Lentil Soup and Turkey Sandwich lunch special. It was ok. The lentil soup was thick and hearty and really hit the spot. However, the turkey sandwich was a bit of a let down. I expected a whole lot more turkey in my sandwich, but it came with a very modest portion which seemed rather uncharacteristic of the usual CF portions. There seemed to be a shortage of staff attending to all the tables as I could see my waitress running from table to table taking orders and serving food.

She was so helpful with everything and made a genuine connection with us. She came back to check on us multiple times and really showed that she cared that we were there and enjoying everything. I would give just Arianna 5 stars if i could, but unfortunately i returned this past weekend with my little sisters. We had just finished the color run and had been up all day and were very hungry. I came here because I was expecting to get the same amazing service that I had gotten previously. Unfortunately i did not. We sat in the bar area, again. Our server dropped off 2 drink napkins (there were 3 of us) and then left, without saying a word. Went back to 2 other tables and did not come back for a few more minutes. We then put in our entire order at the same time and did not see her for another 7 minutes. No drinks (which we got water with lemon, come on that does not take that long to get) and 2 appetizers. At this pointe we were starting to get very hungry and antsy because we had been there for at least 15 minutes and usually within the first 5 they bring the basket of bread. We hadn't even gotten that. Oh and did i mention she never even gave us her name. We watched her go up to 3 other tables and make sure they had everything (twice). And yet when it came to us she wouldn't even look our way.  I then talked to a manager about how disappointed i was, and the manager was not too friendly herself either. By the end of the visit, we had 4 different servers, only one of them introduced herself and took care of us like I expected.

The Cheesecake Factory immediately came to mind as a good ""meh"" place to review.  I'm definitely a bit of a health and food-quality nut so this review is definitely coming from that perspective. I also tend to not be a fan of inauthentic ethnic foods and places that try to do too much. The Cheesecake Factory falls into the negative bracket of all of these things to me.  The Cheesecake Factory to me is also representative of a lot of annoying American attitudes.  Attitude #1: More is better. More is not better in my book. More is wasteful. More causes obesity. The Cheesecake Factory's portion sizes are way too big. I say, moderation is the new excess. Embrace it!  Attitude #2: Quantity over quality. Lots and lots of food doesn't mean its all that great. Butter and salt are not a substitute for high quality food and legitimate flavor.  Attitude #3: Food-like products, especially diet ones, are a good way to lose weight. This couldn't be farther from the truth. Your body needs and craves legitimate nutrients. Not Skinnylicious salads with processed dressing and crappy meat.  I also just really don't like supporting huge corporations, so there it is. Support small-businesses!

They said they did not take reservations, but they would keep it in mind and we could call that morning. We called that morning to make call ahead seating for a large group and showed up over an hour early to put our name in. We waited for over 2 hours, an hour of that was after our ""reservation.""

We were seated after all 15 of us decided to wait inside. They seated us almost immediately after that.  The service was good for the most part. They had multiple servers at our table, which got confusing. They could only split the checks a couple of ways, so we asked them if they could split it in half in a specific way since we had multiple groups within the group and they split it in a completely different way. We are a very easygoing group so I was a little confused as to all the frustration with our group. Overall, they could have had better communication skills. The food was good, for the most part. There were a couple of people that wished they had ordered something else, but other than that the food was good. The cheesecake was the best part of the meal, though.

The steak part was good. The sauce was delicious. The shrimp...was meh. I took one bite and bam, I felt full. I felt like the shrimp was buttered too much or something.  Not sure but the more I ate it, the more I didn't want to eat. Potato was ok. Nothing to really hate beside it taking up most of the plate.                Caramel pecan turtle was good. But it was a bit too sweet in my opinion. The vanilla bean was perfect though. Soft with both vanilla and cheesecake taste while the other cheesecake was stronger on the sweetness. But this is just my opinion.  Overall: this place is pretty and the service is good too.

We were seated at a good spot. The waiter took our orders for appetizers (Thai Lettuce Wraps and Avocado Eggrolls) and were served a few minutes later. The waiter should have given us a much bigger plate and not leave us with just a bread plate. The waiter then introduced us to a new server, Marissa, because his shift was over. For our main entrees, my older daughter ordered  Fettucini Alfredo, I ordered Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms, my other daughter ordered Fettucini with Chicken and Sun-dried Tomatoes which my sister in law ordered too. My husband ordered a Chicken Salad Sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries. Halfway into our dinner, my husband's order hasn't arrived so we called the attention of Marissa who profusely apologized for the error. A few minutes later she came back with the order but brought the regular french fries and not the sweet potato ones. She apologized again and the fries came back at a much later time which the manager brought to our table. We kept our cool because Marissa was apologetic anyway and then the neat thing was she told us that my husband's order was on her including a free dessert of our choice to go (I picked Chris' Outrageous Chocolate Cake). We saved almost $20 for their error. It wasn't a bad experience but not a good one either because we could have responded to Marissa rudely but we chose not to for obvious reasons. We gave her a tip of 15% only because of the error she made :) We usually go to their Irvine Spectrum location for family dinners but we chose their Fashion Island location this time because of the distance from UCI where graduation was held.

179,Jeannie C.,"Irvine, CA",56,123,280.0,4.0,2014-12-04,This is one of many of my favorite restaurants because of the friendly staff members and quick service. Their food is great and portions are huge which I love (bang for your buck!) Their cheesecakes are amazing but I can never finish one because they are so decadent.  Today was an off day for the staff it seems. The front desk girl pretty much ignored me and chatted on the phone with her back turned to me for about 5 minutes. She turns around and doesn't ask or say anything. I tell her table for two and she grabs the menus and walks off not even telling me to go with her. I follow behind and as I sit down she plops the menus I'm front of me and the other plate and leaves without another word. Rude.  Besides this everything else was fine. The manager eventually came by to get our feedback after we mentioned it casually to our waitress. Everything here is pretty good. eventually maybe I'll try everything on the menu haha.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=120,3.2,3.36,3.36,3.568,3.2960000000000007
87,Rob L.,"Irvine, CA",4734,412,1621.0,3.0,2014-12-06,"We went there on a weekday around 2-ish for a late lunch and the place was maybe a-quarter or less full and had plenty of tables available.  But we were led to a tiny two-top in a dark corner.  Seeing that we were not happy with the table the hostess led us to a larger half-booth by the window which was much nicer.  But why didn't she just give us that table in the first place? BREAD: The bread that was brought to us was warm but very chewy - which means that the bread was not fresh from the oven but was microwaved. MAC & CHEESE BURGER:  This was a mistake.  I shouldn't have ordered it.  Being an avid burger lover, I love to try every single kind of burgers that's out there, so I couldn't resist ordering this when I saw it on the menu.  A burger that I've never had before. But the mac & cheese was just way too overwhelming to be a topping for a burger.  It was SO cheesy and SO salty that the burger itself was completely lost.  You could have used the best ground beef patty and the best ingredients in the World and it didn't matter because I couldn't even have tasted it. I know people who love mac & cheese would probably love this burger.  But then, if you love mac & cheese so much, you might as well have a mac & cheese sandwich instead.  Seriously ;) PASTA DA VINCI:  The Penne pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and was topped with sautéed chicken, mushrooms and onions with a Madeira wine sauce.  The wine sauce was really good and the dish had a rich Madeira aroma. The chicken was a bit bland but not bad.  Overall, the dish was good but not great. It's just an average Cheesecake Factory visit.  Not bad, but nothing impressive either, so a 3-star experience is just about right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=80,3.2,3.35,3.35,3.468,3.29
237,Mojdeh S.,"Seattle, WA",301,735,898.0,3.0,2014-12-09,"How I heard of this place: The first time I learned of the Cheesecake Factory was from my sister, Mojgan, years ago. This Cheesecake Factory is no different. Type of cuisine: A typical corporate-style chain establishment, with a variety of options including pizzas, salads, burgers, and pastas in flavors inspired by Mexico, Italy, North America,and beyond . Ambiance: A large establishment, with high ceilings, yellowed walls and decorative glass light fixtures, both hanging from the ceiling and on the walls. Dark brown, wooden backed booths and chair-table seating (in the bar as well) can be found throughout the small spaces created in the venue. Music plays in the background on this evening, sometimes loudly, as the hustle and bustle of restaurant spaces can be heard and felt. Patrons are not shy to speak to their dining companions aloud, but rarely do conversation topics make it to the neighboring tables. The staff, clad in white jeans and button-up shirts, white aprons and shoes are never far away, very friendly and eager to please. At the entrance, like other Factories, hostesses smile behind a large wood and granite slab-lined podium, awaiting the name and number in your party. As you wait for your name to be called, one can visit the cheesecakes and seven-layer cakes on display at the take-away counter, or make your selections for dessert! The tiled floor always sparkles with shine, as your party is guided to its seats. Tall, green plants create a sense of nature in an otherwise dimly-lit, modern-Romanesque setting. Windows along the front side of the establishment look out over the beach, and the beautiful summer sky as it changes from blue to orange to pink with the setting sun. What I ordered: Upon being seated, I knew Mojgan needed an order of the Avocado Eggrolls ($9.95), so I immediately ordered those, and three glasses of water without ice, before even taking a glance at the menu. When my two dining companions took their seats, we also ordered the Buffalo Blasts ($9.95) to start. The Avocado Eggrolls, always a hit between my sister and I, served over a bed of crispy rice noodles, include avocado, sun-dried tomato, red onion and cilantro fried in a crisp wrapper and served with a tamarind-cashew dipping sauce. The Buffalo Blasts, a new favorite, include chicken, cheese and spicy buffalo sauce all stuffed in a spiced wrapper and fried until crisp, served with celery sticks and blue cheese dressing. For our main entrees, my sister and I shared the Cajun Jambalaya ($16.95), the CFs most popular pasta dish! Shrimp and chicken are sautéed with onions, tomato and peppers in a very spicy Cajun sauce and served over rice. Our dining companion ordered the Fresh Grilled Salmon ($19.95) with mashed potatoes and large spears of asparagus. For dessert, we left the ordering to our dining companion, who enthusiastically ordered the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake ($7.95), with moist layers of red velvet cake and the Original Cheesecake covered with special Cheesecake Factory cream cheese frosting. He also chose the Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake ($6.95), caramel cheesecake topped with caramel mousse on a vanilla crust. On a return visit, Wednesday, June 5, 2013: A new SkinnyLicious menu drew our attention with a Grilled Turkey Burger ($9.95), minus the bun: combined with fresh mushrooms, garlic and spices, served with grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, mayo and a green salad, and a Turkey & Avocado Sandwich ($9.95): freshly roasted turkey breast, smoked bacon, avocado, tomato and mayonnaise on a toasted bun, served with a green salad. My husband continued his deep-fried frenzy with the Fried Chicken Salad ($13.95) complete with mixed greens, tomato and green beans, topped with grilled corn, glazed pecans and honey mustard tossed with a house-made Buttermilk-Black Pepper Dressing. We completed our scrumptious late lunch with the new Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake: Oreo cookies baked in the Cheesecake Factory's creamy cheesecake with layers of fudge cake and Oreo cookie mousse, topped with a milk chocolate icing. What I loved: The two appetizers were absolutely tasty and full of rich flavor. The spicy buffalo blasts, served samosa style, and the sweet sauce over the creamy avocado rolls were the perfect start to breaking the second day of the Baha'i Fast. The salmon was soft and tender, light, flaky and fresh, and paired well with the creamy, buttered mashed potatoes. The asparagus served crispy and lightly salty. I really enjoyed the spicy jambalaya, with marinated chicken and tender shrimp, fajita-style vegetables and full of flavor. Of the two desserts, the dulce de leche caramel cheesecake won my vote, even though I could barely eat more than two bites. Why I loved it: The portions are huge and the food consistent from Seattle to Las Vegas, from Orange County to Bellevue. Cost: Average ($9.95 - $19.95 per entree)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=200,3.12,3.34,3.34,3.468,3.2520000000000007

We started with a cocktail and skipped the appetizers to save room for the meal. 1 of the girls got Steak Medallions with vegetables from the light and fit menu, 1got a Veggie Burger, 2 had the Steak Diane and I had the Chicken Madera. The food was presented really well and it came out nice and hot. The only complaint on the Steak Diane from both girls is that it had a very thin gravy to it and it had a very strong distinct flavor of red wine vinegar so whether they use balsamic vinegar glaze as a finish I'm not sure but a very strong distinct red wine vinegar flavor came through. Because the gravy was thin it didn't stick to the steak. They both said that it was very dry but they didn't want to hassle sending it back. After they pointed it out to me I realized I had the same thin consistency of gravy on my Madera. Most of the time the gravy is nice and thick but that wasn't the case this night. The bread was good and the girls liked the wheat one the best but the white bread was very hard and was not warm at all which made it seem kind of stale. Tyson was an attentive server considering that he had a lot of tables to take care of. We had a Lemon Meringue cheesecake for dessert...Wow! I think that was the best part of the meal and I never do dessert so that says a lot!

148,Jae P.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,5,5.0,3.0,2015-05-13,"Went into cheesecake factory for dinner on may 10th. The wait was about 30 minutes. There were many people having dinners for mothers day so it was busy.  My server was Tara excellent service came back and forth refilled my drinks and did everything she can to give me satisfaction. Being former manager for many different restaurant , i could tell she was experienced and she worked hard she definitely needs promotion from being a server to at least a management position so she can teach the other novice servers i observed at the restaurant.   Food was somewhat not the quality i expected from cheesecake factory . I always get the meat loaf dinner plate. The meatloaf i got was cooked, not all the way through ti give that bit of crispy taste on the top layer of the meat and soft inside. It lacked bit of gravy . Mashed potato that i had was smaller about maybe .5 oz less than i would usually get.   For appetizer we had fried mac and cheese. The display of the mac and cheese was not the corporate standard i would expect from cheese cake factory. It looked liked just thrown on the plate. Overall food was about 7.5 out of 10  Restroom for me is important part of the dining experience. It should be clean and spotless. Restroom was not clean . I know it was a busy weekend. However restroom should be always clean . Spotless.   Three things needs to be good in my book to get a good score on fine dining status. 1. Customer service , food quality and presentation 3. Cleanness  Overall i gave 3 stars The customer service was wonderful thank you tara. And food was above average . However clean part failed .

Ahhh, The Cheesecake Factory... no mall is complete without one, right? This location will not disappoint true fans as it features an extensive menu of various items dreamed up in a test kitchen with flavor profiles that will not scare old white people or children. The service is professional grade for the most part and comes with unlimited rented smiles both tableside and at the bar.  This franchise clearly believes in the jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none approach as proven by the colossal menu featuring everything from Miso Salmon to Chicken & Biscuits, Calabrian Pizza, Carppacio, a Baltimore inspired Pit Dip Sandwich...

We came in and were seated shortly. I wished that things had been a little cleaner. It looked like the booth hadn't been wiped off after the last group of people left our table, so there were crumbs everywhere. There was also a bunch of food gunk inside my menu which was gross. Every menu should really be wiped down after every use to ensure that there is no food on it.  For my dinner, I got the margarita pizza and a side of macaroni and cheese. I thought the macaroni and cheese was very good. It could have used a little more flour for the cheesy sauce to be more consistent. It had a creamy thinner sauce at the bottom of the dish, and the cheese was stringy on the upper part. Overall, it was good though and served hot. My margarita pizza was okay. I wish it had been hotter. The crust could've been crispier. But I enjoyed it. My husband had the Old Fashioned Burger. He requested that it be prepared medium rare, but it was more like medium well to well done. He explained to our server that he was allergic to onions and garlic and we were told that my husband's burger was without any garlic or onion. I think there might of been some sort of seasoning in the burger patty itself though (maybe some onion or garlic powder), because my husband started to react as if he were having a mild allergic reaction. After dinner, we had the red velvet cheesecake which was excellent. It wasn't too rich when you split it. It was part red velvet cake, part cheesecake and had cream cheese frosting and white chocolate (served with whipped cream).  Our server was pleasant and got us everything we needed, however, towards the end we became slightly disappointed in him. We told him to use up the gift card and then to split the difference on the credit card (which I admit, can be confusing if you use the word ""split""). He returned it to us and the entire check had been split in half (half on the gift card and half on the credit card). We tried to track him down for a few minutes and we told him that we were very sorry, but we wanted the gift card to be used for the full amount and then we wanted the remaining balance on the credit card. When we asked him to please correct this, it was clear that he was frustrated with us and he responded with, ""Well you said to split it in half"" (in a frustrated tone). We definitely did not tell him to split it in half. I explained to him that we said to use up the gift card and then split the difference on the credit card. He corrected it and then just kind of dropped the book on our table and didn't make eye contact or say anything.

Our waitress also had what looked like a small red sore on her nostril which was also unappetizing. Fourth- the window shade was insufficient and sun was in our eyes. Last, the food was hit or miss- it wasn't like it used to be. The salad quality, freshness and dressing was under par. Sad.

Essentially a cheese covered chicken with mashed potatoes- still good. Tremendous portions. Also had the factory nachos - it was once again, decent. Can't forget the original cheesecake, that one is a dessert must. I ended up completely full, but too full. It was tough to drag my bloated self around the mall.

When it comes to food, we are addicted to their endless amount of food choices/drinks/etc.  Food aside, what I want to write a review about is the spectacular service we had this past Saturday. It was lunch, not a special occasion, just a typical meal. Shelly F. was our server and from start to finish she was on top of it. From the little things like making sure our meal was made perfect by our request and giving her opinion on certain dishes when needed....to hot towels (really??) to wipe our hands post meal and lastly, to-go beverages! Simple, easy to execute, but sooooo appreciated! She went above and beyond with the service, and I can honestly say I've never had better service in my life than with Shelly. Shelly you made my day!

The only thing holding this establishment from a 5 star rating is more attention to service and the customers. The staff at Cheesecake knows their food tastes great and it does, but with more attention to customer service this could be one of the best chains around. When I went to The Cheesecake Factory, I ordered the sample platter for the appetizer which came with a variety of egg-roll-like appetizers and 4 unique sauces which was very nice, and accommodated everyone at the table. For my entree I ordered the Steak Diane cooked medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. The medallions paired with the traditional mashed potatoes and mushrooms was very well executed and I would definitely order it again. For my drink (yes I'm mentioning my drink) I ordered A strawberry lemonade, meaning only one. I say ""A"" because when I finished the waiter never came to ask me for a refill, and I know I could've asked for one but the staff didn't fill any of our drinks when they were empty unless prompted.

It's weird because normally the Cheesecake Factory restaurants I go to are always packed and it's like a 30-50 minute wait. But luckily we were seated immediately.  This Cheesecake Factory is smaller than the ones I usually go to. But the view is pretty nice, and I think it's even better at night. So I guess that compensates for everything. I did notice a lack of servers at this Cheesecake Factory (I saw one server with 5 tables). Our server was nice, but she didn't check up on us as much as I wanted her to. And she did lag on bringing us our drinks.  My friend and I weren't in the mood for big plates so instead we just ordered several small appetizers and just shared it. We originally ordered some spinach and artichoke cheese dip but our server told us that they apparently ran out of it so we got some nachos with spicy chicken and a sausage and ricotta flatbread. I was actually disappointed with the selections of food we got. I come to Cheesecake Factory often and I love everything I order - pastas, sandwiches, and burgers but I wouldn't recommend appetizers. The nachos were a big portion but it was just a bunch of chips- not enough guac, cheese, sour cream nor salsa. There was barely any chicken on them too. I understand that nachos are not a healthy food choice but I didn't understand why the chips had to be deep fried- like there was actual oil dripping from the chips. I was also annoyed with the flatbread we got, it was too small- not really sharable size. I do have to say the Georgia Peach (alcoholic beverage) was amazing but more on the too sweet side. I'm willing to check out other appetizers (but not reorder the ones I tried during this visit) and return here since I am a loyal fan to Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=80,3.12,3.33,3.432,2.54,3.246

While visiting our friend, we decided to try out this Newport beach location and were impressed.  Here is why: As we entered we found ourselves surrounded with dozens of families waiting for tables and full tables as far as they eye could see - a rather grim sight when you are toting two hungry kids. To our surprise we were at the front of the line within seconds and handed a disk with a promise of a 10-15 minute wait ... and in 5 minutes we were seated!!! Still a little gun shy from the sheer number of patrons being served - we resolved that it would probably be quite some time before our orders were taken - or - we would see our food. Minutes after being settled in a waitress came to take our drink/appetizer order. We didn't time her - but it seemed like she walked into another room - was magically handed our drinks - and just had to return to the table with them ... it was FAST! We were ready to order when she returned (because we had been thinking if we didn't get our order in right away - we may never eat). Our food came, and it was a reasonable wait, not speedy fast and not super long...but the food itself was IMPRESSIVE! Hot, delicious, flavorful, large portions (had I I known I would have ordered and shared my meal). Then the waitress checked back several times, not annoyingly, to make sure we were happy, brought extra rolls & butter, refilled drinks, and even made time to chat a bit about where we were from --- ALL while giving the same service to others in her section.

We drive all the way down the coast from Long Beach to visit here, and we are frequent customers. Tonight we took our friend who is visiting from out of state down the coast to birthday dinner here. We stopped at the beach to enjoy the sunset and listened to the waves. We took our time because we had looked up the hours on the website and it clearly stated that this location closes at 11pm on Sunday. We walked in at 10:06pm only to be told they were CLOSED! I asked for a manager and the guy went away and came back apologetic, but no manager. He said we could still buy cheesecake. We went to the cheesecake counter figuring we'd at least buy our friend a piece of cheesecake for her birthday. Nobody could be bothered to help us for another 5 minutes. We asked for a piece of cheesecake, one guy turned around, told us they were out of that one, then went back to what he was doing, with no intention of helping us at all. Finally, I decided to ask for a manager. I showed him the website info on the cell phone. He was apologetic, but did absolutely NOTHING about it. This is not the level of service or professionalism that I have come to expect from The Cheesecake Factory. Another couple had also been standing there waiting to be served. They were equally annoyed by this guy's obvious lack of manners. He sent us off to the Huntington Beach location with what essentially amounted to a shoulder shrug.  We asked the manager to call the Huntington Beach location since we knew it was going to take us half an hour to drive BACK to Huntington Beach, and we'd be arriving at 10:45pm.

She said she usually works weekends so it was a far cry from her normal shifts. Hm... I work in a very well known restaurant, if one of my greeters ever said that to one of my guests, they'd be fired!  We finally get to our table, all the way back in the corner, practically on top of another table (my husband pulled our table away to give us and the poor people we were basically sitting on more room).  Server comes solicits drinks, nothing in particular, no suggestions, so we opted for good ol H20! She asks if we want bread, YES!! The bread is so yummy...if it ever arrives to the table. We wouldn't know if it was yummy, it never arrived. But do you want to know who would know if the bread is yummy? The party of 20 they decided to seat right next to us, in a VERY empty restaurant. They had bread at the table before they even sat at the table.  Server comes back and I ask if the Skinny Shrimp Tacos are fried or grilled (I should have known but yes, I asked), she didn't even know the answer!! She had to go check and come back! Still no bread. I opted to order Shrimp Scampi instead. We also at that point asked for straws and even straws took 7 minutes to get. Still no bread.  Que me being SUPER irratated at this point.

Creamy and cheesy, not dry at all. - Pasta Carbonara with Chicken: The garlic parm cream sauce was incredibly oily, and not creamy at all. The pasta was dry and oily, and the chicken was overdone as well. Definitely don't recommend it. - Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta: the spicy chipotle sauce was delicious, and the chicken wasn't overcooked in this dish! Would recommend it. I usually go for the classic cheesecake, but we decided to try the key lime cheesecake and the salted caramel cheesecake. Definitely LOVED the salted caramel cheesecake!! Would recommend that one or the classic cheesecake. [SERVICE] Once we were seated a server came up and took our drink orders. After she returned with our drinks we asked for a couple of minutes to take a look at the menu. When we were ready to order I tried to wave our server (or any server for that matter) down for a good 10 minutes. I was very disappointed at how inattentive they all were. Once I finally got someone's attention, we ordered. They brought out our appetizers immediately, but we waited another 20 or so minutes AFTER we finished our appetizers for our pasta dishes to come out. It also took a while to wave down a server to get the check as well.

Go for the mushrooms as they were served hot and tasted great. The tots were okay- deep fried and served with ranch or 1000 island dressing. Boring. And I didn't try the artichoke dip- no need as I've had it a million times before (to make: 3/4 to 1 c. quality mayo + 1 c.shredded parmesan cheese + 1 can (drained) artichokes in a food processor for a few seconds until pureed - for spinach add drained thawed spinach!). Drinks were good - hubby enjoyed his Manhattan and I had a Vodka Collins. Guests enjoyed wine and Cosmos. Dinner included mushroom soup and Cesar salad (gobbled down!) for one guest; hubby and I each had the cobb salad but one split between us would have been better (salad had lots of bleu cheese and crunchy bacon . . almost too much bleu cheese) and other guests enjoyed Thai salmon.

We put in drink orders of 4 waters and 1 hot tea, and kindly requested the basket of bread. 15 minutes pass, and we do not have our drinks, nor has anyone checked on us. We had to flag down a manager, and only then did we get our drink order and bread. The waiter brings our waters and says ""sorry, I am really tired today."" After our meal, we ordered a cheesecake, and a 3 hot teas. Cheescake is dropped off with no utensils (all utensils were taken with our finished meals). Sometime passes and we inquire about our tea, and we were told ""well I have about 10 other tea orders, so I will get to your order when I can."" Finally they brought three tea glasses, one of which seemed to be taken from another table as it was filthy. We had to ask three different people to finally get a clean glass. Lastly, we were given two hot water pots for the three teas, both of which were only half full, and one was cold. We called the manager yet again to inform him of the situation, however, it seemed the manager was not bothered by the dirty glass, half full and cold water pots, or the poor customer service. He promised to get new pots of hot water, but they never came out.

42,Sebastian S.,"Newport Beach, CA",71,93,70.0,5.0,2016-12-27,"Out of every single restaurant I've been to around the world, Cheesecake Factory always remains as my go to place that I have to go to at least once a month. This is the first place I take anyone from outside the US that visits me and they always love it.  Many say CF is way overrated and that it has more items on its menu than it can handle. You either love it or hate it. But honestly, I'm in love with this place and have yet to try something on the menu that I didn't like. And of course, cheesecake being my favourite dessert makes this place heaven! Haven't found any other place that serves cheesecakes as good as this.  So the happy hour here is out of this world! There's heaps of different appetisers to chose from at super good prices along with discounted drinks. It's usually between 4-6 M-F and it's totally worth it. My go to appetisers are the avocado egg rolls and the factory nachos! Both of them are AMAZING!! Love how on the nachos, the chips are baked which really makes a difference in taste. I've also had the sliders and the buffalo blasts both of which are excellent as well!  If I come outside of the happy hour, I tend to get a burger or a sandwich but I've tried a good chunk of other items on the menu and they're honestly all really good. Basically anything you get, unless its on the skinny menu, is going to come in a ginormous portion so be prepared to take food home. You really can't go wrong with anything you pick.  And then there's the cheesecakes. The gorgeous, decadent, mouth-watering cheesecakes. Whether you like the food or not, everyone has to agree that the cheesecakes here are to die for and that no where else makes them as good as CF. For starters, they're just beautiful to look at. The presentation of every cheesecake is amazing and the taste is just as good. Every bite takes you to heaven. Yes, it's that good. My personal favourites are the Godiva (you really have to love chocolate for this one) , S'mores, Oreo and red velvet. I will say that the only one I can't recommend is the Chocolate chip cookie dough. Not as good as it seems. Otherwise, you can't go wrong. Don't like cheesecake? Try the Godiva brownie sundae. Thank me later :)  In regards to this specific location in Newport, haven't had any problems.

Both their meals were tasty but the chicken on the salad a bit dry. I got chicken salad sandwich w a side of sautéed spinach off the Skinnylicous menu. Someone came out from the kitchen and told us our food was taking so long bc the kitchen had to remake my sandwich bc it didn't look right or something. If what I received was a remake I would hate to see what the first one looked like! My side of spinach was raw so I had to wait for the sautéed spinach which was over salted and unfortunately the best part of my meal. My sandwich was two slices of brioche bread (I thought the menus said brioche bun but whatever) with about 1/4 cup (at the most) of chopped chicken mixed with mayonnaise and a few pieces of shredded lettuce. The most pathetic sandwich I have EVER had at a restaurant. I know it's on the skinny menu but to charge someone $12 for this is criminal. They should just take it off the menu. I literally can't believe they even served this to me after making me wait and telling me they had to remake it!  Yes I ate it bc I was hungry and my husband and kid were done eating by the time I got my food.

Everyone but my sister's food came out, and the waiter then said they did not have the ingredients to make my sister's salad. This would have been fine, except the rest of us already had our food. I find it hard to believe that they only realized they didn't have the ingredients until everything else was out.  My sister ordered a different salad, which took forever to come out. They gave my grandmother the wrong dressing on her side salad and no one came by to see if everything was okay so she couldn't return it.  Our waiter disappeared without saying a word after he told us they couldn't make the first salad, and we were left with multiple other people who came by occasionally, but not when we needed anything.  They didn't even seem sorry that they messed up, or offer to take the salad off the bill or offer dessert. Which was not what we were looking for, but it would have been a nice gesture.

32,Mackenzie S.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",58,2,,1.0,2017-05-06,"I've been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory for a long time, but I had such a bad experience here that I don't think I'll be returning to any CF for a long time. I'll be honest: I have to eat below 25g net carbs per day, which means dish modifications are basically a way of life when I go out to eat. After finding nutritional information online, I thought I had some great menu options that, with a few modifications, would fit my diet. Exciting! I settled on the Skinnylicious Steak Medallions, which normally come with mashed potatoes, wine sauce, crushed croutons, asparagus, and mushrooms. I asked for the dish without croutons, potatoes, and the sauce (all high carb, though I would've loved to eat them!), and I asked to swap another side - sautéed spinach - for my potatoes. I ordered the medallions medium-rare.  I wish I'd taken a picture to show you how my dish arrived, because it was honestly unbelievable that ANY restaurant would let a dish like that out of the kitchen. The five medallions were the size of quarters and so over-cooked that I could hardly chew them. Spinach was haphazardly thrown all over the plate, and the other sides were missing. Even when I asked for them to be brought out, they were quickly sautéed and thrown on the plate the same way. I got a pretty clear impression of the chef's thoughts on my orders - I was another bitchy customer ruining a recipe, and I didn't deserve the effort it took to put together a nice dish. Look, I know modifications are annoying. If I could find even a single restaurant that made dishes I could eat without any special requests, I would eat there every day of my life and never bother anyone else with my ""high maintenance"" diet.

However, taking off two stars simply because the seating hostess who lacked empathy to my mom who was in a motorized wheelchair and asked us to put it at the front of the restaurant. Firstly, if she could walk that distance would we have not done that? Clearly she is in a wheelchair for a reason and needed it to get to the table and maneuver around the restaurant. Some people need to have better training and courtesy with people with disabilities. They are also patrons and deserve to not feel shamed when they enter your business with medically necessary equipment. When we checked in we requested a table that could accommodate this and we were told ""not a problem."" In an effort to not have a tiff in front of customers I guess the hostess backed off because I was completely angered when she requested we leave the wheelchair out front. We just moved the wheelchair to the side near an empty table. A family member was trying to move it to the side and the hostess tried pulling the wheelchair from the arm, which had i not told her to stop she may have broken it. Maybe she was trying to be helpful however at that point I just preferred she not since we were handling it. Maybe this location should consider some ADA complaint tables for people who require more ""space"" for their equipment.

Not even fully melted. The breading on the chicken slid right off at the slightest provocation. And the chicken itself tasted pretty bad. Even the side of fries was flavorless. What's perplexing is that my table even spoke to a manager type who dropped by to tell us about the extensive quality control. He mentioned how the managers are constantly testing the food. We watched as he informed a chef that his pasta water needed more salt. So if they were that hot on quality control, how did something as nasty as my chicken sandwich hit my plate?

The entrance and hostess stand were bustling with lots of people waiting for a table. It took us 15 minutes to be seated, not bad.  Although there were literally people at every booth and table, the space is not cramped. Each table has enough space so that you can hear each other and no one else is on top of you.  The menu is extensive. The burger, lettuce wraps, and kids corn dogs were all really good and served quickly. Portions are huge! I suggest sharing, as the appetizers were even too big for a meal.

The food is consistently wonderful, but this last experience was so great it had me leaving no choice but to come sing praises on yelp. Considering how above and beyond the on-duty manager was at the time, I should definitely remember his name, but Ron (or Rob) was there for me every step of the way. I placed a $1400 catering order and told him I needed it by 11:30 am which is around the time the restaurant opens. Any other restaurant would have told me it was impossible to pick up an order that large so early, so I was fully expecting to hear the same this time. Instead, I was assured it would be no problem. At one point the day of the pick up I was so nervous it wouldn't be ready I called to confirm and a gal on the phone told me to come in a few minutes later just to make sure the order was completed. Ron (or Rob) immediately called me back and said ""your order will be ready at 11:30, we don't mess around!"" I showed up at 11:30 sharp and sure enough - all 15ish bags of my food were freshly prepared and ready to go. To take this entire process one step further, he even got a crew together to help me carry all the items out to my car, himself included. Now this is the type of customer service I would never come to expect especially from a large corporate restaurant, but Cheesecake Factory is setting a new standard both with their friendly, hard working, efficient, sincere staffing, , and their food quality.

We are talking seriously mediocre salads at lunch time. The beets were canned not roasted as promised!! Eew!  I could see the indentations from the can on them!! Yuck!! I had the fresh vegetable salad with grilled chicken. It could more accurately be described as the ""Whatever Vegetable Matter Salad with refrigerated cold grilled chicken laid on top for an extra $4"".

They later came back with white rice... and something else on the side. (See pic) Looks like lipstick. We told our server and she said it's not it's something else. .... with further examination, it was lipstick. They said the'll bring another plate out but we passed on it.
