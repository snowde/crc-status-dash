886,Lou J.,"Commerce Township, United States",0,6,,2.0,2013-01-11,"We went on a Wednesday at 3:30 and were seated immediately.Food was presented well and tasted good. Now for the bad...Our silverware was dirty with food specks, table was not clean and it took twelve minutes for anyone to greet us and take our drink order. One thing that was an odd contradiction was server took our napkins and placed them on our laps but our waters were in old plastic beer mugs.? Our server(in his late twenties) kept remarking how my seventeen year old daughter was so pretty.CREEPY. Then the food runner and bus boy approached us with the same comment.We felt uncomfortable and couldnt wait to leave. I thought this was a fancy place. We received the service and professionalism of a local bar but at three times the price. tip; request a booth when putting in your name for seating.But if you are a ""people person"" and dont mind touching elbows with the table next to you then accept first available.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-novi?start=460,3.3040000000000003,3.3040000000000003,3.3040000000000003,3.3040000000000003,3.3040000000000003

629,Jadranka H.,"Birmingham, United States",611,167,1228.0,4.0,2013-02-12,"I'm addicted to this place, in this case it's a good thing! The feel of the place is hip, energetic, modern and alive!  This review is a combination of 3 visits, the staff is efficient, knowledgeable, friendly and goes above and beyond their job title. As for the food, there are literally pages of menu items that you would need a minimum of 10 minutes to get a full overview.   The dessert menu is a whole different story, that can take up to an hour to overview. Whatever you have ever dreamed of as your perfect cheesecake, they have it! I like the traditional cheesecake with fruits, but before you know it, your mind is in overload from the menu that you venture out to wanting everything.  I'm knocking down a star for the professionalism of a manager that I had to engage with when my chicken spring rolls were literally the same color, the multi purpose grease was not changed and it was still dripping with oil. This manager didn't have the full customer service skills needed in that restaurant. He didn't know how to fix the problem. I call it common sense. I didn't let that discourage me from coming back and my guests have taken a liking to it like I have. The majority of the menu items are enough for 2-3 people, keep that in mind.  Here's a priceless advice that I do, pull up and run in, get your name on the list, go park/valet, and go window shopping. I wish they took reservations, but that creates more madness! See you there very soon........",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-novi?start=140,3.504,3.504,3.504,3.504,3.5040000000000004
809,Michelle N.,"San Jose, United States",283,584,90.0,5.0,2013-03-11,"In honor of birthmonth (yay!), the bf took me here for a late-night date...night, haha. We arrived ~10PM and were told of a 2 hour wait.  We took a pager and in the mean time scoped out some bar seating, which opened up within 5 mins of us looking!  Score!!  We had a great time with our bartender, Jared, and really enjoyed the food, watching the hockey game, and the nice buzz that the drinks gave us. ;) We ordered: - passion fruit mojito: probably my fave adult drink EVER at any restaurant I've been to..but I'm also really sentimental, and this was my first 21+ drink (aside from the shots everyone tried to poison my liver with the night I actually turned 21 -_-)..sooooo delicious. - strawberry daiquiri: could use a little more blending, but still delicious!!!  Lucky for me, the bf was driving, so I enjoyed most of both drinks. ;) - crab & artichoke dip: sooooo good!! I always order this, and while my complaint is that it's a little too mayo-y, that has more to do with corporation's recipe, not this particular location. It really is good though, so try it! - calamari: the bf's pick..nothing too special IMO, but he's a huge calamari fan and seemed to enjoy it - chicken di pana: I ALWAYS order this, too!!  It's my go-to: pan-fried, breaded chicken; mashed potatoes; broccoli.  The portions here are huge.  I was really worried that the portions would be small (as I had read in a previous yelp review), but I thought my chicken di pana portion size was the same as other CCF. - angel hair pasta w/shrimp: I do not recommend this.  The bf ordered it, and it honestly looked like a bowl of tomatoes and 4 shrimps. The shrimps were salty, the pasta was hidden waaaaaay under tomatoes, and ugh yuck, I just do not like tomatoes. - warm apple crisp: so the whole reason I even wanted to venture out to CCF was the mojito and the warm apple crisp.  For some reason, I was craving it, and it did not disappoint!!!  I just wish the ""crisp"" was crispier and not so mushy, and I need to remember to request no whipped cream next time. - strawberry cheesecake & snickers cheesecake to-go: I'm not a cheesecake fan, but the bf is pretty excited to eat his cheesecake for dinner tonight, haha! Tips/thoughts: - It's a brand new CCF, as well as the only one in Michigan, so of COURSE there's gonna be a horrendous wait.  Please don't yell at the hostess or give her attitude, it's not really her fault everybody wants to eat here. - Service from the bartender, JARED, was great!!! I highly recommend looking for bar seating if you don't want to wait.  He was personable, gave us his honest recs, boxed up our food for us (score! bf & I hate doing that, haha!), and was honestly on his toes all night..not sure how he does it, but I was exhausted just looking at him! - If you look for bar seating, please return your pager. I hella hate when people hog a bar table, then move their food/drinks over to a booth when it clears up. Don't be that jerk. Give the booth to someone else if you already have a bar spot. - I can't even believe this needs to be said, but please remember to tip!!!  And tip well.  The waitstaff is doing the best they can (at least IMO, from sitting at the bar and watching them run back and forth with drinks).  The dessert area really helps the bar area, and the workers all seem pretty friendly and willing to help each other.  I'm throwing this in here bc I think the people near us gave a 5% tip, which I'm still fuming about a whole day later hahaha. - The venue is small. Much smaller than other CCF that I'm used to frequenting. Overall, I'm a fan.  I'll be back to look for bar seating! :D",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-novi?start=300,3.54,3.54,3.54,3.54,3.5400000000000005

Then I realized why the wait is so long.. . Their waitstaff is inexperienced, slow to come take orders and the kitchen is slow to come out with the food.  Seriously the worst service I have ever had and I  went on a Monday night.   The reason they still get 2 stars is for the food which is pretty good.  However I had a hard time enjoying my food since everyone else at the table had already gotten their food 15 minutes before I did.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-novi?start=320,3.24,3.24,3.24,3.24,3.2400000000000007

From West Coast to Midwest to the Southeast, I've always had great experiences.  THIS LOCATION IS NOT UP TO STANDARDS  OF ALL OTHER NATIONWIDE CCF LOCATIONS. The bar staff was overworked and their menu skills need polishing.  The servers approached us with our food at the bar expecting to hand it to us rather than set it down.  Completely inept training overall.  I'll spare the other blah, blah details as most wont be interested.

Be prepared to have at least a 2 hour wait to be seated. Plan around that! Go to the mall, do some shopping...get drunk in the parking lot (if you are 21 or older), whatever!  People KNOW that you're going to have to wait if you see a line out the door and through the parking lot. Why throw a hissy fit when the hostess tells you it's going to be a 2-3 hour wait?!

I still have a soft spot for The Cheesecake Factory.  I went awhile back in the sweet spot of dining out time wise. It was like a Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon around 3pm. There was little to no wait. Wait staff did a good job. Sat in a half booth and was comfy too.  The food was really quite delish. My dad had the steak Diane and shrimp scampi combo, my mom had the Jamaican black pepper shrimp and I went with the herb crusted salmon. All were happy and huge, none were dietician friendly. I think very few things on the menu are to be frank. This doesn't bother me a bit, if you are trying to eat anywhere near healthy it may bother you. Me, well I figure they state they are a cheesecake place so I am not expecting health food. I love the sinful nature of the salmon here, the lemon sauce is creamy and evil, a pure butter base. This rich sauce is perfect with the slightly crisped salmon, calorie bomb mashed potatoes and tender crisp asparagus. I also loved my mom's shrimp because of the black beans, mango salsa and fried plantains. They all worked together well with the kick of the shrimp. My dad's scampi was tasty but I am not hugely into steak Diane. It is a good rendition if you like it though. I will get a salad next time because the portions were so generous I couldn't order a dessert. I took a bite of my mom's carrot cake and meh. Skip it. I'm betting the carrot cheesecake is better. I find the cakes in here to be a bit overrated myself but the cheesecakes are always fabu. My bite of my father's key lime cheesecake was bliss. I like it here a lot but will not be a regular until the hype dies a bit.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-novi?start=300,3.472,3.472,3.472,3.472,3.472

I want to give a stellar review before all the nerd foodies come and trash it. First up, they do not accept student dining hall passes here -- that being said this is for serious food fans. The prices are great, the quality is greater -- I got a big kick out of the presentation of each dish I ordered --- The calimari is really great here -- and there was enough to share. It was piled up really high and it was fresh and not frozen -- it came with two sauces - including cocktail sauce and lemon -- which is a big deal with me. I don't go for that dismal warm marina sauce that some restaurants throw at ya. Every category here is worth raving about including the salads --- it was well prepared and thought out. I grabbed a pizza here too which was incredible and just the right size. I got the ""everything"" pizza and it had wonderful pepperoni on it and it was light and not heavy. I couldn't resist not taking my servers suggestion and walked out of that place with a slice of  chocolate tuxedo cheesecake -- pure Heaven kids. The decor of this place is going to knock your socks off they did a stellar job of putting this place together. I really loved the customer service too -- everyone bent over backwards to please. I didn't feel rushed here even though the line was long. I only had to wait 40 minutes to get a table even though I was originally quoted 1.5 to 2 hours of waiting time. I didn't get into the bar scene here but they got a beaut. They have an amazing bar with lights and plenty of seating right by the outdoor patio. In addition to mojitos and margaritas they have a full wine list. There is a brunch menu option too when you come.

745,Anthony D.,"Royal Oak, United States",118,73,4.0,2.0,2013-08-23,"I ended up going to Cheesecake Factory about a week after they opened.  Around 3pm on a Monday.  I figured at that time it would be as slow as it's going to be.  We tried to enter through the mall, and an employee shoo'd us away.  She said we couldn't enter that way and had to walk all the way around to the entrance facing the parking lot.  So we walked all the way around, and re-entered the establishment through the ""allowed"" entrance.  We approached the host stand where there was a large crowd of people waiting to be seated.  We were quoted a time of 2 hours and 30 minutes to seat our party of two.  Lucky for us, there was an open high top table near the bar, which is first come first serve.  We ended up getting a table in less than 10 minutes!

269,Anthony D.,"Royal Oak, MI",118,73,4.0,2.0,2013-08-23,"I ended up going to Cheesecake Factory about a week after they opened.  Around 3pm on a Monday.  I figured at that time it would be as slow as it's going to be.  We tried to enter through the mall, and an employee shoo'd us away.  She said we couldn't enter that way and had to walk all the way around to the entrance facing the parking lot.  So we walked all the way around, and re-entered the establishment through the ""allowed"" entrance.  We approached the host stand where there was a large crowd of people waiting to be seated.  We were quoted a time of 2 hours and 30 minutes to seat our party of two.  Lucky for us, there was an open high top table near the bar, which is first come first serve.  We ended up getting a table in less than 10 minutes!

No big deal until we see everyone being seated except us and then it became a 45 minute wait.. My mom then asked the last at the front desk what the deal was and she was rude and her reply was literally ""45 minutes is a short wait."" Now, if she didn't have an ugly tone while speaking to us or would have said about an hour of a wait OK no problem. Also, I'm not racist, but we were the only white people in line for this amount of time and all the black people were seated very promptly...and the staff at the front desk was black. I don't care who you are, everyone still plays that stupid race card.  Anyway, we end up sitting at the bar now because they can't even tell us when a table would be ready.. Whatever no big deal... Until we sit at a table in the bar section for another 25-30 minutes with no waiter/waitress arriving.. We went to the actual bar to get our own drinks. How sad is that? Then the waitress wanted to say we weren't there for that long and I was really irritated my parents were being treated badly so I looked at her and simply stated ""Yes. We have."" Oh, but the African American party of 6 right behind us in the bar area were taken care of like they were GOLD. I had to ask for a water when our waitress finally arrived..which never came until AFTER my entree but she also took care of that other table and they had everything they ever needed. Was NOT a good experience. This review is for take out-- I happen to work in a salon close to CF so I thought since a client told me their carry out is about a 30 minute wait that I could order our food and pick it up on my way home from work. Guess what? I did.. But maybe it wasn't what I was expecting since the last time I ate CF was when I was 15, maybe? My BF has never had it and we absolutely are disappointed with the type of crowd there so no chance would we wait in line for something so close to home. Called in the order which was not as bad as I thought. It was VERY loud in there, but the lady who took my order kept apologizing and was very calm and repeated my order not once, but twice, to make sure she heard correctly. Thanks! Went inside to pick it up and there is no designated line to pay for carry out orders and it was literally a jungle. No one had any idea what they were doing (patrons), but that IS the staff's responsibility. It was executed very, very poorly. So bad in fact that I had to push my way to get to the register. Even then there were still people being obnoxious and cutting, or trying to re-order more cheesecake. Anyway, on to the food. I ordered the bang bang chicken and shrimp for the BF. My first initial thought was ""wow, that's an awfully small portion size."" It was sort of sad of how small it was because they ARE known for large plates. I could have easily eaten the entire entree myself. It was small enough that I actually had to share my salad with him. Although, flavor was right on. For myself I had the Chinese salad with their pomegranate vinegarette. It was giant. We didnt even put a dent in it. It was absolutely delicious and would get it again. Vietnamese summer shrimp spring rolls: decent, but the rice paper was sort of hard and way too chewy. I have lived with Vietnamese people and this is not what a rice paper roll is supposed to be the texture of. Good flavor, but that and the fact they give you three is a bit disappointing for what you get with the price you pay. Cheesecake: Red Velvet- Good, but I can always taste sugar in whatever I eat so I barely touched any. My Bf says its the best cheesecake he's had because it is more of a ""cake.""

Chicken salad sandwich.  No raisins or almonds or honey in it.  Then the dessert.  I asked for chocolate raspberry.   I got the cheesecake.  Mentioned to other table I couldn't taste raspberry.  The woman, a cheesecake factory veteran said u are missing the raspberry puree on top.   She told waitress who brought it out.  Then the bill came showing I was charged for sauce and revealed what I had gotten was chocolate truffle cheesecake!  No wonder.   Sigh.  2 hours wasted on that meal.   I was so unhappy.  The next table told me not to tip and said I got terrible service which I agreed.  I still left a 5% tip tho",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-novi?start=440,3.6,3.6,3.6,1.8600000000000003,3.6000000000000005

I have been to the Cheesecake factory multiple times in various states and can honestly say that their PROPORTION SIZE IS A LOT SMALLER ( I'd say by about half).  3.) So, as a result of all of this, I decided to talk to the manager. However, that was not even possible because HE NEVER CAME. Instead, he told the waitress to just give us 1 piece of cheesecake! For all 8 of us! Then, if that wasn't enough, we all realized that even the cheesecake was 1/2 the size of the portions they serve elsewhere!!!!!! Same price just with  smaller, incomplete and inconsistent food. I will never waste my money here ever again.  I'd rather go to McDonald's.....",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-novi?start=380,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.372,2.76

It's understandable that everyone wants to try this restaurant, but I truly don't believe that the long wait is due to the quantity of customers. I think that the wait is due to the restaurant being understaffed. If the restaurant hired more staff, the turnaround would be quicker and the wait would not be as long.

One of my friends left her passport in the car, and could not get served.  I guess if you have an enhanced license you can't get served at this restaurant. Our appetizers were great. No complaints there. They ran out of the macaroni balls that we really wanted to try, but the spinach dip was great.  One of my friends and I ordered the exact same lunch pasta meal. My pasta was slightly undercooked, but hers was like it wasn't even boiled. Not a good thing. She wasn't impressed.

I've never experienced any other Cheesecake Factory's before as I've lived in Michigan my entire life, so I have nothing to compare this too. I'm just comparing this to any other restaurant I'd eat at.  When it comes down to it, this place is really weird. Some things are great but most things are just... barely okay.  When you walk in the first thing you see are high ceiling and some strange decor. Not sure who the interior decorator was, but he had some weird taste. But whatever, this is about food not color schemes.  First off, I came in on Wednesday at 3pm and there was told a half hour wait. I'm not sure why. I saw plenty empty tables. I didn't want to wait, I immediately knew it wasn't going to be worth it. My company insisted on at least trying it, so I obliged.  Waited 20 minutes, still not great and I assume they just overshoot the time anyways so people will feel better getting a table sooner-than-expected. A man set us down at a small two-person table along a very long bench. Very cramped. Not a lot of moving around room and there are people about 1-2 feet away from you. You can hear their conversation, and they can hear yours. Waiter took 3-4 minutes to arrive with water and take our drink orders. Water is good for me. My company ordered something, took another 3 minutes for that to arrive.  Meanwhile, we're fronted with an absolutely staggeringly huge menu. It's 21 pages. It has advertisements in the menu. Advertisements. In. A. Menu. This is the first time I ever saw ads in a menu and was blown away. I don't understand. Really, the menu is just too big. It has 5 pages of specialties. This place specializes in over 30 items of stuff ranging from Chinese to Mongolian to American to French? They call their burgers glamburgers. I had a chuckle at that. But seriously, 21 pages of items. I'm an indecisive person. It took to me forever to get a even basic picture of what they serve. Maybe some people like a menu consisting of a minimum of 200 items. I don't. I can't imagine a chef being able to perfect over 200 items in a chain restaurant. This isn't a Michelin starred restaurant.  Meat sounded good, so I decided on a burger since I doubted the 3pm Wednesday chef could cook an excellent steak (prime fillet cost $30). Steak is just one of those things for me that if I'm going to have I'd like it to be awesome. Call me smug, but an Outback steak just doesn't cut it.  Anyways, I had the Kobe Burger. Food arrive in a quick fashion. During this time, our waiter has yet to be seen since they took our order, which was about 15 minutes ago. They did not bring our food, someone else did. Another 5 minutes went by until they appeared, but only to say ""Enjoy your food"" and then to run off. Didn't leave any room to ask for something. I wasn't served any condiments with my burger or fries or offered any. So, after not seeing her for the past 20 minutes, I kind of shrugged and decided to eat it anyways.  Surprisingly, the Kobe Burger tasted pretty good. I ordered medium rare, received medium, but it tasted good. Mind you, it wasn't stunning, but I was happy with it. The fries were also surprisingly good. So, despite everything, I'd say the food is pretty good. However, again, our waiter did not appear for another 10 minutes. They came by to serve another table across from us, did not look our way. Came by another 5 minutes but to ask that same table if everything was okay. I could hear her. She didn't look our way. Finished our meals, glasses empty. Waited another 5 minutes for the check. Received the check, needed it spit (was not asked if together or separate, not something I immediately think about). Took another 2 minutes to receive that. Overall, wasted a lot of time. I'm beginning to understand why the wait is so long.  -- Summary -- This place is okay. Not great. Comparatively, there are a lot better places, CPK being one of them across the corridor.  Seating for two people is extremely cramped and you can hear other peoples conversations who are seated right next to you about 2 feet away.  Food is good. For the price, I'd say value is pretty good. Service is terrible. The waitress did not ask if we needed anything during the meal because they did not show up during the meal. Glasses were not refilled during the entire time we were there. They were, however, over by us multiple times but simply ignoring us or did not think about us. Either way, not good. Wait is unwarranted. If wait staff didn't waste time with checks and not spending 10 minutes to bring the check, and then it needing to be separated (why don't you ask?). I saw it took about 15 minutes to empty and clean the table that was empty next to us when we got there. That no doubt is a big reason why turnaround and seating is so slow.

The menu is huge and for the most part everything we had were delicious and huge. We had two small plates, white bean humus and fried polenta. Oh my,  you must try the fried polenta. It's creamy like a mozzarella stick but a little nuttier with a great tomato sauce. The humus was just ok and I probably wouldn't get it again. At this point we were already pretty full but my meal was just as delicious and I had left overs for two days.   Don't forget the cheesecake. I live peanut butter and I love it with cheesecake. I think they probably have 25 different cakes. I probably won't ever try them all but I sure would like to try.   The wait isn't worth 4 hours if you are in a large party.  We only had two of us and were sat within an hour fifteen.  It wasn't even that bad because they said we could going to the mall as long as we were back within 30 minutes before they said.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-novi?start=460,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.9920000000000004,2.52

449,Michelle N.,"San Jose, CA",283,584,90.0,5.0,2013-11-03,"In honor of birthmonth (yay!), the bf took me here for a late-night date...night, haha. We arrived ~10PM and were told of a 2 hour wait.  We took a pager and in the mean time scoped out some bar seating, which opened up within 5 mins of us looking!  Score!!  We had a great time with our bartender, Jared, and really enjoyed the food, watching the hockey game, and the nice buzz that the drinks gave us. ;) We ordered: - passion fruit mojito: probably my fave adult drink EVER at any restaurant I've been to..but I'm also really sentimental, and this was my first 21+ drink (aside from the shots everyone tried to poison my liver with the night I actually turned 21 -_-)..sooooo delicious. - strawberry daiquiri: could use a little more blending, but still delicious!!!  Lucky for me, the bf was driving, so I enjoyed most of both drinks. ;) - crab & artichoke dip: sooooo good!! I always order this, and while my complaint is that it's a little too mayo-y, that has more to do with corporation's recipe, not this particular location. It really is good though, so try it! - calamari: the bf's pick..nothing too special IMO, but he's a huge calamari fan and seemed to enjoy it - chicken di pana: I ALWAYS order this, too!!  It's my go-to: pan-fried, breaded chicken; mashed potatoes; broccoli.  The portions here are huge.  I was really worried that the portions would be small (as I had read in a previous yelp review), but I thought my chicken di pana portion size was the same as other CCF. - angel hair pasta w/shrimp: I do not recommend this.  The bf ordered it, and it honestly looked like a bowl of tomatoes and 4 shrimps. The shrimps were salty, the pasta was hidden waaaaaay under tomatoes, and ugh yuck, I just do not like tomatoes. - warm apple crisp: so the whole reason I even wanted to venture out to CCF was the mojito and the warm apple crisp.  For some reason, I was craving it, and it did not disappoint!!!  I just wish the ""crisp"" was crispier and not so mushy, and I need to remember to request no whipped cream next time. - strawberry cheesecake & snickers cheesecake to-go: I'm not a cheesecake fan, but the bf is pretty excited to eat his cheesecake for dinner tonight, haha! Tips/thoughts: - It's a brand new CCF, as well as the only one in Michigan, so of COURSE there's gonna be a horrendous wait.  Please don't yell at the hostess or give her attitude, it's not really her fault everybody wants to eat here. - Service from the bartender, JARED, was great!!! I highly recommend looking for bar seating if you don't want to wait.  He was personable, gave us his honest recs, boxed up our food for us (score! bf & I hate doing that, haha!), and was honestly on his toes all night..not sure how he does it, but I was exhausted just looking at him! - If you look for bar seating, please return your pager. I hella hate when people hog a bar table, then move their food/drinks over to a booth when it clears up. Don't be that jerk. Give the booth to someone else if you already have a bar spot. - I can't even believe this needs to be said, but please remember to tip!!!  And tip well.  The waitstaff is doing the best they can (at least IMO, from sitting at the bar and watching them run back and forth with drinks).  The dessert area really helps the bar area, and the workers all seem pretty friendly and willing to help each other.  I'm throwing this in here bc I think the people near us gave a 5% tip, which I'm still fuming about a whole day later hahaha. - The venue is small. Much smaller than other CCF that I'm used to frequenting. Overall, I'm a fan.  I'll be back to look for bar seating! :D",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-novi?start=300,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.868,3.3200000000000003

This review is a combination of 3 visits, the staff is efficient, knowledgeable, friendly and goes above and beyond their job title. As for the food, there are literally pages of menu items that you would need a minimum of 10 minutes to get a full overview.   The dessert menu is a whole different story, that can take up to an hour to overview. Whatever you have ever dreamed of as your perfect cheesecake, they have it! I like the traditional cheesecake with fruits, but before you know it, your mind is in overload from the menu that you venture out to wanting everything.  I'm knocking down a star for the professionalism of a manager that I had to engage with when my chicken spring rolls were literally the same color, the multi purpose grease was not changed and it was still dripping with oil. This manager didn't have the full customer service skills needed in that restaurant. He didn't know how to fix the problem. I call it common sense. I didn't let that discourage me from coming back and my guests have taken a liking to it like I have. The majority of the menu items are enough for 2-3 people, keep that in mind.  Here's a priceless advice that I do, pull up and run in, get your name on the list, go park/valet, and go window shopping. I wish they took reservations, but that creates more madness!

I still have a soft spot for The Cheesecake Factory.  I went awhile back in the sweet spot of dining out time wise. It was like a Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon around 3pm. There was little to no wait. Wait staff did a good job. Sat in a half booth and was comfy too.  The food was really quite delish. My dad had the steak Diane and shrimp scampi combo, my mom had the Jamaican black pepper shrimp and I went with the herb crusted salmon. All were happy and huge, none were dietician friendly. I think very few things on the menu are to be frank. This doesn't bother me a bit, if you are trying to eat anywhere near healthy it may bother you. Me, well I figure they state they are a cheesecake place so I am not expecting health food. I love the sinful nature of the salmon here, the lemon sauce is creamy and evil, a pure butter base. This rich sauce is perfect with the slightly crisped salmon, calorie bomb mashed potatoes and tender crisp asparagus. I also loved my mom's shrimp because of the black beans, mango salsa and fried plantains. They all worked together well with the kick of the shrimp. My dad's scampi was tasty but I am not hugely into steak Diane. It is a good rendition if you like it though. I will get a salad next time because the portions were so generous I couldn't order a dessert. I took a bite of my mom's carrot cake and meh. Skip it. I'm betting the carrot cheesecake is better.

I visited the restaurant on a Wednesday night back in November and waited about 45 minutes which was much less than expected. I expected the food to be better especially because the establishment had been open about 3 months prior.  First, they were very busy with one single waitress waiting on all the tables in the area, who was extremely rude. The menus itself were seriously gross-they were very greasy so I automatically felt dirty and disgusting eating in there. We ordered sliders as apps, an ahi tuna roll, and fried shrimp (dynamite shrimp) i believe it is called. The sliders were tasteless, the tuna roll was okay but nothing amazing, and the dynamite shrimp tasted like fried batter. We also asked for fresh bread because the first time it came out it was not good or fresh. When we got the ""new"" batch it was just as cold and I could tell it was old because it was just so flaky and dry.

665,Rebecca C.,"Ferndale, United States",385,181,8.0,2.0,2014-01-14,"I won't even lie: I was as excited as everyone else that Michigan finally got a Cheesecake Factory. I've been to the locations in Chicago and Fort Lauderdale, and remember them fondly.  So why was I horribly underwhelmed with last night's dinner? After a 50 minute wait, we were seated. We started with an appetizer of fried macaroni and cheese (my mom's request). They were....weird. We were served 4 baseball sized macaroni and cheese balls. There was a bit of tomato sauce on the plate (still not sure if it was a garnish, or a dip). They were tasty, but gave me an instant stomachache. For dinner, I had the chile rellenos burger. Chile Rellenos is my absolute favorite food to order at Mexican restaurants, so I thought I'd give it a go. The pepper was stuffed with cream cheese, like a jalapeno popper. It wasn't horrible, but it definitely wasn't what I thought it would be.  My mom ordered the Bellagio Chicken. It was bright green because of the pesto they used. They also covered the entire dish in basil. It looked like a big green mess (and I love pesto).  My daughter ordered the cheeseburger sliders, which came out with no cheese.

129,Rebecca C.,"Ferndale, MI",385,181,8.0,2.0,2014-01-14,"I won't even lie: I was as excited as everyone else that Michigan finally got a Cheesecake Factory. I've been to the locations in Chicago and Fort Lauderdale, and remember them fondly.  So why was I horribly underwhelmed with last night's dinner? After a 50 minute wait, we were seated. We started with an appetizer of fried macaroni and cheese (my mom's request). They were....weird. We were served 4 baseball sized macaroni and cheese balls. There was a bit of tomato sauce on the plate (still not sure if it was a garnish, or a dip). They were tasty, but gave me an instant stomachache. For dinner, I had the chile rellenos burger. Chile Rellenos is my absolute favorite food to order at Mexican restaurants, so I thought I'd give it a go. The pepper was stuffed with cream cheese, like a jalapeno popper. It wasn't horrible, but it definitely wasn't what I thought it would be.  My mom ordered the Bellagio Chicken. It was bright green because of the pesto they used. They also covered the entire dish in basil. It looked like a big green mess (and I love pesto).  My daughter ordered the cheeseburger sliders, which came out with no cheese. We sent it back and they promptly fixed it. For dessert, we had the smores cheesecake - which was amazing. Fantastic. I can't say enough words to describe how delicious this was.

394,Amy P.,"Washington, MI",38,132,2.0,3.0,2014-01-17,"Recently visited this place with some friends. I was quite pumped. We arrived and the wait was quoted as 2-2.5 hours. No problem, the place is attached to a mall how bad can that be. So the hostess told me to come back an hour later for a pager. So I did and received my pager. I asked how far the pager works and she stated down the hall to the information desk. Really? So that means I was confined to this hallway for the next 1-1.5 hours?!?!?! With our technology these days I feel like there could be a better system so people could at least walk around the mall and when a party was about 30 minutes from being sat maybe they could send a text or something to return for a pager. It would be much more enticing to stay.  However I've wanted to try this newest Factory location for a while and being in the company of good friends made the wait easier. We waited the full 2.5 hours if not about 15 minutes more. Our service was ok. It was obvious our waitress was busy as some things took a little long but that's to be understood. We ordered the polenta fries to start. We debated getting two for the table but decided just for one, but our waitress must have misunderstood as the food runner brought two orders. When we told her we only wanted one she started arguing with us stating that the check definitely said 2 and that we definitely wanted 2 orders. Um what? Ok. So we told her we debated getting two but decided on 1 and was going to get another app instead. She proceeded to say that she definitely looked at the check twice and there was definitely 2 rung in which means we definitely ordered 2. Whatever, clearly we weren't getting anywhere with her so we just told our waitress who made no big deal about it, took 1 back and said it was her mistake and we put in for the tomato and mozzerella flatbread. The apps were decent. The polenta fries were really good, soft and pillowy on the inside, a nice crunch on the outside, and the marinara was delicious and a perfect compliment to the polenta.  The flatbread was ok. The tomatoes not being in season lacked flavor, but the basil and the rest of it was tasty. I don't think I'd get that again. Being it was my first visit to this location, and some years since visiting the Chicago location I ordered the Chicken Madeira on our waitresses recommendation. It was served with a nice helping of mashed potatoes on the side. The mashed potatoes had great flavor, but being a former waitress myself, I knew my entree sat in the window for a hot minute because there was a crunch on top of them from sitting under a heat lamp. The chicken itself was tender and tasty, but I'm torn on the sauce. It was very very sweet. A little spice or even some fresh black pepper could have gone a long way. It was maybe just a little too sweet for my liking, but it wasn't bad or anything. Very much like a sweet marsala sauce. The cheese was definitely a nice touch.  The rest of the party seemed to enjoy their dishes. They each got a pasta dish and had no real complaints.  For desert we of course got cheesecake. I'm pretty traditional when it comes to cheesecake, I like it plain so I can enjoy the pure goodness of the cheesecake. The cheesecake itself was delicious, light and pillowy but full of cheesecake flavor. Of course the crust has to be as good as the cheesecake part of it, and this one lacked a little. There wasn't a lot of it and I like a lot of crust. One of my fellow diners ordered a Macademia nut cheesecake and that one was heaven in a cheesecake. You still maintained the originality of a cheesecake with some macademia nuts inside, but the crust was simply amazing. It was a blondie butter brown sugar type crust, but it was thick and gooey and absolutely amazing. I would definitely recommend that cheesecake for sure.

I am a frequent visitor of this franchise in Chicago, Las Vegas, and San Diego, but Novi was not comparable. I visited the restaurant on a Wednesday night back in November and waited about 45 minutes which was much less than expected. I expected the food to be better especially because the establishment had been open about 3 months prior.  First, they were very busy with one single waitress waiting on all the tables in the area, who was extremely rude. The menus itself were seriously gross-they were very greasy so I automatically felt dirty and disgusting eating in there. We ordered sliders as apps, an ahi tuna roll, and fried shrimp (dynamite shrimp) i believe it is called. The sliders were tasteless, the tuna roll was okay but nothing amazing, and the dynamite shrimp tasted like fried batter. We also asked for fresh bread because the first time it came out it was not good or fresh. When we got the ""new"" batch it was just as cold and I could tell it was old because it was just so flaky and dry. We also ordered a fresh strawberry cheesecake which was really good (as it should be).

Some bowtie pasta with mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, and chicken. It was very good. I appreciate that Cheesecake Factory always has very consistent food. The pasta has always been cooked well, with generous, quality meats and veggies. Even though I was full after half of my pasta, I split a mango key lime cheesecake with my friend. I mean, it's a CHEESECAKE factory. The cheesecake was very tasty and light. I'm not sure I could have handled the more hardcore cheesecakes, haha.

Now on to the cheesecake, this is where everyone should have high expectations.  A huge selection almost hard to pick just one, everything sounds amazing.  We settled on two slices to take home.  Chocolate cookie dough and red velvet cheesecake.  They were everything we had hoped great flavor and well prepared not frozen.  Is it worth waiting 45 minutes to an hour absolutely, 3 hour wait? Well that might be a stretch.

For some reason, everytime I go here, there's a Black Friday line. It's calm down a lot since it's opening premiere, but still, expect 60-90 min before you eat. Plan your appetite accordingly, otherwise you're gonna be a grumpy eater. If you're a true regular, you'll know the secret of waiting at the bar for a table. The bar seating tables aren't that bad. Food is the same and service is quicker.  I don't know whether the menu is different from Cali or if it's changed in general but some of my favorite dishes are missing. Atmosphere is consistent with all other chains. Great restaurant for celebrations, anniversaries, or just to have a good time.  The restaurant is not as big as other cheesecake factories I've seen. Otherwise, I highly recommend!

The restaurant is quite small which makes it even a longer wait. There is a small bench for people who are waiting, and a bar you can grab a seat at as well (but it was all full). We decided to wait anyway and were seated around 8:15pm. We were famished by the time we were seated. I unfortunately forgot the name of our waitress, but she was fantastic. She greeted us as soon as we were seated and quickly brought us a round of water , bread, and butter. She also gave great suggestions and offered to answer any questions we had. i ordered the caribbean cooler which was really yummy and refreshing! (one complaint i do have is that the drink was not strong at all- tasted like the bartender forgot to add alcohol to it, and i generally don't like my drinks strong!) For my entree, I decided to go with one of her suggestions, which was the Farfalle Pasta with Chicken and Roasted Garlic, which is a bow tie pasta with chicken, mushrooms, tomato, pancetta, peas, and caramelized onions in a roasted garlic-parmesan cream sauce. I brought up how I wanted to substitute the chicken with shrimp (due to no meat on Fridays during Lent), and she was very accommodating and even informed me of the pancetta (which is bacon), and asked me whether or not I wanted to take it out as well. The pasta was soooo good! I would definitely come back and order it again! After dinner I ordered the Tiramisu Cheesecake and my s/o ordered the red velvet cheesecake. Both were very delicious.

I got wasabi tuna, and my boyfriend got the Jamaican shrimp--he made the better choice. I can't remember which cheesecakes we got but they were good too.  The second time we went, a Tuesday night, the restaurant was still full but our wait was only about 20 minutes. We ordered an appetizer, which seemed to be taking awhile to come out. Then all of a sudden our meals were brought out! We decided to cancel the appetizer. I can't remember what my boyfriend ordered, but I got the combo chicken madeira and steak diane.

I can't remember which cheesecakes we got but they were good too.  The second time we went, a Tuesday night, the restaurant was still full but our wait was only about 20 minutes. We ordered an appetizer, which seemed to be taking awhile to come out. Then all of a sudden our meals were brought out! We decided to cancel the appetizer.

However, we knew that the lines would be outrageous during the first few months of opening, so we didn't go until about a month ago. We came here on a Wednesday, at 4pm, and literally waited 2 minutes to be seated. For an appetizer, we tried their Avocado Eggsrolls. The eggrolls are scrumptious and the Tamarind-Cashew dipping sauce was amazing. I hope there's a store that carries it!  For my main entree I had the ""SkinnyLicious Turkey & Avocado Sandwich"". I was very satisfied. It wasn't greasy, it wasn't dry, it was well put together, and it wasn't too big. I can't recall what my friends ordered, but they were satisfied with their meals as well.  I also had a strawberry lemonade... made of actual lemonade and strawberry juice. It wasn't some flavored minute-maid crap, so that made me happy. No complaints about dessert either. As for service, whenever a waitress (not just ours) passed by, they would check on us. One of them was also pretty funny, so that's a plus.

The restaurant was busy, but everything was prompt. The server was on her game with filling up my water glass and clearing unneeded dishes.

I ordered off their Skinny menu, which is actually quite good! My bf had a sandwich, and it was pretty good. We decided on a cheesecake together, and it was pretty good.  I noticed there were several birthdays happening, and the waitstaff who sing happy birthday are actually good singers who were harmonizing! Pretty cool.

This place is absurd, and no one should support such a horribly created restaurant. That being said, it's the perfect restaurant for the typical Novi-ian, and as far as I'm concerned, they deserve to wait in line while other much better restaurants can have my business :) Oh, and another thing, if you compromise and go here on a weekday instead of the weekend, you're rewarded with stale 3-4 day old cheesecake that's hard to put a fork through.  Can't imagine what kind of food leftovers you're getting then, either.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-novi?start=280,3.52,3.23,3.14,2.308,3.346

However, we knew that the lines would be outrageous during the first few months of opening, so we didn't go until about a month ago. We came here on a Wednesday, at 4pm, and literally waited 2 minutes to be seated. For an appetizer, we tried their Avocado Eggsrolls. The eggrolls are scrumptious and the Tamarind-Cashew dipping sauce was amazing. I hope there's a store that carries it!  For my main entree I had the ""SkinnyLicious Turkey & Avocado Sandwich"". I was very satisfied. It wasn't greasy, it wasn't dry, it was well put together, and it wasn't too big. I can't recall what my friends ordered, but they were satisfied with their meals as well.  I also had a strawberry lemonade... made of actual lemonade and strawberry juice. It wasn't some flavored minute-maid crap, so that made me happy. No complaints about dessert either. As for service, whenever a waitress (not just ours) passed by, they would check on us. One of them was also pretty funny, so that's a plus.

It's just not great or something you'd want to go out of your way for.

The price was not listed on the menu, nor was presented to me when I was ordering. That was a rip-off, but not the worst part. When I got the Bistro Shrimp Pasta, which comes with spaghetini, the pasta was all stuck together in like 20 strand clumps. I sent it back because it was not done and chewy. While I was waiting, my husbands food was getting cold, so I insisted on him eating, so at least one of us enjoyed our food. Once I got my food, it was okay; not great, but not terrible. Definitely, not worth $17.95 though. They did not offer to comp my meal or anything like that, even though my husband was completely done by the time I got mine. Then we ordered cheesecake, to go. My husband got the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. He said it was okay.... I got the strawberry cheesecake. It came with 3 strawberries, they were SOOOO tart. I figured out why my strawberry lemonade was so terrible. For all of that, we spent $65. That was a HUGE waste. The place does not have good enough food for me to spend $65.

942,Natalie D.,"Monroe, United States",0,24,,2.0,2014-09-21,"The wait was not terrible. On a Sunday at 5, we waited 30 minutes. Pretty normal, I would say. However, I ordered the strawberry lemonade. It was VERY VERY sour. It tasted terrible. I wasn't sure if it was the strawberry or the lemonade, either way I puckered every time I drank it. This lemonade costs $4.75. The price was not listed on the menu, nor was presented to me when I was ordering. That was a rip-off, but not the worst part. When I got the Bistro Shrimp Pasta, which comes with spaghetini, the pasta was all stuck together in like 20 strand clumps. I sent it back because it was not done and chewy. While I was waiting, my husbands food was getting cold, so I insisted on him eating, so at least one of us enjoyed our food. Once I got my food, it was okay; not great, but not terrible. Definitely, not worth $17.95 though. They did not offer to comp my meal or anything like that, even though my husband was completely done by the time I got mine. Then we ordered cheesecake, to go. My husband got the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. He said it was okay.... I got the strawberry cheesecake. It came with 3 strawberries, they were SOOOO tart. I figured out why my strawberry lemonade was so terrible. For all of that, we spent $65. That was a HUGE waste. The place does not have good enough food for me to spend $65.

It also gets one star in comparison to other Cheesecake Factories I've been to as well as in comparison to other restaurants that are in the same genre/tier.  We went on a Sunday night and had to wait 4 hours to get in. Four hours! Part of the reason we had to wait so long was because we had a party of 13. We were celebrating my mom's birthday and she really wanted to try it out so we did...  I've been to The Cheesecake Factory in Honolulu and it was really no big deal to me. The food was fine. Not bad, not great. This time around was pretty much the same, but worse. First off, the floor was absolutely disgusting. There was so much grime on the floors that you never really had good traction  when walking. Totally gross. They needed someone to clean the floors during the busyness of the rush(es) and that clearly never happened. I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp and the shrimp part was fantastic - I'd totally eat that again. At the same time, the rice that came with it was hard and bland. My friends and family ordered steaks and that was a complete debacle. My mom wanted the hibachi steak and was told that they ran out of that steak for the day. Odd... Then 10 minutes after we ordered, the waitress came back out to tell some other friends at our table that they didn't have the kind of steak that they wanted either. Ridiculous! Why did it take them 10 minutes after we ordered to tell us that they didn't have it??? As a result, my mom and my friends ended up ordering one kind of steak with another kind of steak's veggies and toppings - per our waitresses recommendation. You'd think that would all come out together, but no, they brought the veggies and toppings out separate and several minutes before the steaks came. This made for 4 or 5 extra plates on our table. More ridiculousness! I ended up having some of the steaks and they were just ok... I told my wife that they were like ""better versions of a steak you might find at Ponderosa"". Seems to me like this location needs new management. When in Hawaii, the Cheesecake Factory there was well run. This location was like a bad, bad impression of Hawaii's. I wanted to really enjoy this place, but they almost made it impossible.  On a brighter note, as soon as we were seated the wait staff brought out free slices of bread and bananas for all the kids we had with us. That was really nice. But not enough to offset the other stuff that happened.  If I ever go back, it'll be because someone else suggested it. I'd get the Jamaican Shrimp again for sure.

It's almost a given at this point since every time I go, it's with my grandma who takes me out shopping once or twice a year.  I highly enjoy this place. The waitstaff is extremely knowledgeable and professional, the menu is extensive, and the place seems to be run well like clockwork.  I'm a huge pasta person so the carbohydrates are usually what I go for. I've had the Pasta Carbonara twice and it's amazing! The garlic sauce added to the dish is a perfect compliment. I've also tried many of the other dishes since I tend to sample my family's as well. The plates are always very flavorful and delicious!  Now let's get on to why ya'll are really here. The Cheesecake!! I've never been a huge cheesecake person, but this place knocks the dessert of cheesecake out of the frickin park! I've not only been to the Cheesecake Factory in Twelve Oaks, but also to the one in Las Vegas. Both have the same level of divine taste for dessert! My favorite Cheesecake is the Oreo. It's so good and besides I'm obsessed with Oreos. It's not the healthiest thing in the world, but I live with it.  Needless to say, if you've never experienced The Cheesecake Factory, do it.

For some reason, everytime I go here, there's a Black Friday line. It's calm down a lot since it's opening premiere, but still, expect 60-90 min before you eat. Plan your appetite accordingly, otherwise you're gonna be a grumpy eater. If you're a true regular, you'll know the secret of waiting at the bar for a table. The bar seating tables aren't that bad. Food is the same and service is quicker.  I don't know whether the menu is different from Cali or if it's changed in general but some of my favorite dishes are missing. Atmosphere is consistent with all other chains. Great restaurant for celebrations, anniversaries, or just to have a good time.  The restaurant is not as big as other cheesecake factories I've seen.

Well she really wanted to eat there so she got there and was given a buzzer & was told to keep checking on the wait time every 40 min. The problem was that when we got down to the 25min interval and went to the desk to be seated we were then told that the wait was another hour! Like who does that! We were getting ready to leave after standing around another 30 minutes trying to figure out what the what!  Then all of a sudden we were walking on a slippery SLIPPERY floor getting seating as we were just about to leave.

This place was a huge addition to Twelve Oaks. I went with a couple friends, and this was my first time to a Cheesecake Factory. It was a year after they opened so there was no crazy wait time, and it was summer, so they had very nice outdoor seating. We ended up sitting outside, it was a very nice day. We sat under a big umbrella in what was like a big outdoor booth. I ordered the pretzel crusted chicken strips, which is an appetizer. I didn't enjoy them as much as I thought I would, and the presentation wasn't exactly appetizing... They were served on wood skewers and one of them broke inside the chicken, so I was afraid I was going to eat part of the stick. This is why I gave four out of five stars! The waitress was great, even when she was waiting on multiple tables she made time to refill our drinks quickly and was knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered cheesecake, and I am not a cheesecake person, but I tried a couple bites, and it was great. It was the S'Mores cheesecake, it looked almost too good to eat, but we devoured it within minutes.

We have dined here three times since they opened at 12 Oaks Mall.  We didn't go for the first time until last summer, because of the long waits.  As someone else stated, this place is good, but not wait 3 hours good.  I wouldn't really wait more than 30 minutes for this place. The food here is really good with large portions.  As someone else stated, everything is surprisingly good, but it is also really high in calories.  I am pretty sure I doubled my caloric intake just by eating one meal.  The nice thing is that my wife and I usually will split a meal because the portions are so big and you really have to leave room for the cheesecake. The cheesecake is really good, although really expensive for a piece of cheesecake.  I am pretty sure you can buy a pretty good whole cheesecake somewhere else.  We are not huge fans of cheesecake, but ""when in Rome""....maybe ""when in the Cheesecake Factory""?  Anyway, it is really rich and even when we split a piece, there is some left over.  Last time we got it with ice cream and the ice cream was amazing.  We might actually just get ice cream next time. The reason for only getting 3 stars is because of the overpriced items, the close quarters, and the mediocre service.  As stated by others, this place squeezes you in like coach class in a Spirit flight.  You definitely feel like you are sitting at a table with strangers, which may be customary in Europe, but not in America.  The waitstaff all three times have been just alright.  There are long wait times for bread, refills, and the waitstaff we have had has lacked any type of enthusiasm.  I have actually felt more welcomed at a Denny's. Overall, this is a good ""once and a while"" type place.  We usually come here for special occasions like birthdays or Mother's days.  If you do come, I suggest splitting a meal and probably a cheesecake as well.  In the end, if it is good enough for Sheldon Cooper it should be good enough for you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-novi?start=140,2.88,3.09,3.12,3.1480000000000006,3.006

And another 30 minutes for our cheesecakes that we ordered to go. Our waiter was great; made sure we had refills and plenty of bread as we waited. Now to the good stuff our food. I ordered the chicken Bellagio which I wanted to sub the cream sauce it comes with for Alfredo sauce. I had this dish before and didn't care for the sauce it came with. It wasn't thick enough for my liking. I get my plate eat some of it and realize it wasn't Alfredo sauce. Huge disappointment but since I didnt want to wait another long time for the correction I just sucked it up and decide just set it aside and safe room for cheesecake. My mother ordered  the burrito which was surprisingly good. I would def give that a try next time. My sister had there steak Diane and chicken Madeira which are favorites of mine. Absolutely love the sauces on them. My uncle had their Shepard's pie which he enjoyed. The cheesecakes were delicious as usual. The food is really good here despite me receiving the wrong sauce. Its nothing to die for or to wait over an hour for but it is better than your average chain.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-novi?start=240,3.52,3.19,3.144,3.056,3.322

338,Claudia G.,"Troy, MI",0,4,,2.0,2015-05-06,"First of all: when I was walking into the Cheesecake Factory yesterday evening, I thought it looks like it deserves more than 2.9 stars on Yelp, but I have to say now - This is completely justified (if not even overrated). I rate my experience at restaurants on the basis of 3 components (Food, Service, Speed):  - Food (2.0) Appetizer: The Nachos we ordered as appetizers were okay for bar food, but not worth $11! Processed Cheese that didn't taste like anything, and soaked through Nachos is what we got. Not overly impressed. Entrees: my husband and one of our friends had the Imperial chicken and SHRIMP, but the kitchen staff apparently forgot to put even a single piece of shrimp in there. They ate it anyway, because at that point we had waited for our food for 40 minutes already (and for a table for about 40 minutes as well). I ordered the Steak Tips with Mashed Potatoes off of the skinny menu (because earlier Yelp reviews scared me, mentioning the high calorie content of the regular menu;)). The steak was drenched in salt (and I am not a picky eater, neither a person who cares about their sodium intake), and the asparagus tasted moldy. I complained and had the waiter bring me a completely unsalted version of the steak tips. It took 30 minutes until I received it (and the others were already done eating). This second attempt was less salty, but had the consistency of a shoe sole (veeeeery chewy). I ate it anyway (at least the mashed potatoes), because at this point it was 8:50pm (ish) already. Apparently that is what you get for trying to eat healthier ;) stupid me! - Service (1.0) We (a party of 5) came in at 7pm and they told us we would have a waiting time of 55 minutes. We kind of expected that and went to the bar to grab an appetizer and a drink. (at this point I should mention that one of our friends is pregnant and cannot eat certain foods, such as not pasteurized cheeses). We ordered the Nachos with cheese and asked our waitress what kind of cheese it is, to make sure our friend could eat it, too. The waitress just looked at us and said ""well, it's melted and shredded cheese"". After that we asked again what KIND of cheese it is, and she just went on explaining that it is a melted cheese blend. She obviously had no idea, but did not consider asking the kitchen staff as well.  When our buzzer went off, my husband and I went to check out the table, while our friends cashed out at the bar. The lady responsible for seating the customers led us to a table for 2, which obviously was not big enough. She apologized and had the staff put together two small tables, which was still way too small and barely fit all our plates (the high tops at the bar were bigger than this table). As for our entrees: my husband ordered Bang Bang Chicken, but they didn't have that anymore, so he switched to the Imperial Chicken and Shrimp, but asked the waiter if he could get grilled chicken instead of breaded chicken. The waiter asked in the kitchen and came back explaining ""we can do it, but it will probably take away from the taste. When we use breading, we bread the chicken. When we don't bread it, I have no idea if it is still as good. You will have to order it at your own risk"" (great statement, right?:P). - Speed (2.0) as mentioned before it took about 40 minutes until we got our entrees (and we didn't order fancy stuff), and an additional 30 minutes for my second try with the steak tips. Bottom line: Probably good food if it were a bar, but I would have expected more from the Cheesecake Factory. Insanely overpriced and salty and fatty. We didn't get to try the cheesecake in the end, because we were so annoyed, and some of us very full (the portions are insanely big!). I know for sure that we will not go back there.

We sat down and I noticed that the silverware was just sitting on the bare table. Not on a napkin, not on a plate or any other barrier between it or the table. It immediately freaked me out, but my sisters tried to reason with me and suggested that maybe they spray the tables down with bleach and that was sufficient for me if it was the case. While we were waiting to order the waitress brought our drinks and proceeded to set UNWRAPPED STRAWS ON THE TABLE. Again, I thought okay, they must clean these tables well. I mean, how could they get away with putting these items on the bare table after people have rubbed their hands and arms all over the table, perhaps maybe sneezed or spat during dinner -  they MUST use a bleach spray. While we continued to wait to order we watched the bus boy ""clean"" off the table next to us. The procedure was as follows: He took the dry looking towel out of the back of his sweaty apron, brushed the crumbs on to the floor, wiped off the booths and chairs (where peoples butts belong) wiped the table again and then set it. SO, your silverware and straws are sitting on a table that was not sprayed with a cleaning solution, wiped with a towel from the bus boys back, dragged across the germs from someones tush and then smeared back on the table.

My fiancé and I went to Cheesecake Factory for the first time last night, we've had their cheesecake before at another location and decided to go here for dinner and dessert as it was our anniversary. We arrived at 730 on a Thursday night, and only had to wait 10 min to be seated outdoors. Our server took 10min to bring us water, then he took our order at 745, and dropped off bread at 750. At 830 the food runner dropped off our food. I had a burger and she had alfredo. (Side note, one of the food runners that took food to the table next to us had bleeding cuts or burns on his hands, and was bare handed touching plates and food!) She said her food was barely warm, and mine was over cooked and my fries tasted like they cooked them directly in a batch of fish. After about 10 min of waiting for our server, I decided to just eat my charcoal burger and fish fries. Around 850 our server showed back up and asked if we needed anything, I asked him for our bill and a cheesecake menu. At 905 he brought the cheesecake menu and left. At 915 he came back and took our dessert order. At 925 he brought our bill. At 930 he came back to ask if we wanted boxes for our dinner, and took our bill and payment. At 940 he came back with our cheesecake and said rudely ""umm did you want that change?"" ARE YOU SERIOUS yeah you should give me my change, do you really think you automatically get a $10 tip. I would have left it for him because we always tip 20% but if service is outstanding we'll do 30%+. With our cheesecake slices one was on its side and smashed up.

943,Nate C.,"Westland, United States",2,22,4.0,1.0,2015-05-23,"They should just stick to making cheese cake. Unlike most people our wait was not bad, service and food was awful. My fiancé and I went to Cheesecake Factory for the first time last night, we've had their cheesecake before at another location and decided to go here for dinner and dessert as it was our anniversary. We arrived at 730 on a Thursday night, and only had to wait 10 min to be seated outdoors. Our server took 10min to bring us water, then he took our order at 745, and dropped off bread at 750. At 830 the food runner dropped off our food. I had a burger and she had alfredo. (Side note, one of the food runners that took food to the table next to us had bleeding cuts or burns on his hands, and was bare handed touching plates and food!) She said her food was barely warm, and mine was over cooked and my fries tasted like they cooked them directly in a batch of fish. After about 10 min of waiting for our server, I decided to just eat my charcoal burger and fish fries. Around 850 our server showed back up and asked if we needed anything, I asked him for our bill and a cheesecake menu. At 905 he brought the cheesecake menu and left. At 915 he came back and took our dessert order. At 925 he brought our bill. At 930 he came back to ask if we wanted boxes for our dinner, and took our bill and payment. At 940 he came back with our cheesecake and said rudely ""umm did you want that change?"" ARE YOU SERIOUS yeah you should give me my change, do you really think you automatically get a $10 tip. I would have left it for him because we always tip 20% but if service is outstanding we'll do 30%+. With our cheesecake slices one was on its side and smashed up. I felt the service was terrible and slow, and the food was similar to a run down coney island. On top of that I think we got food poisoning.

774,Claudia G.,"Troy, United States",0,4,,2.0,2015-06-05,"First of all: when I was walking into the Cheesecake Factory yesterday evening, I thought it looks like it deserves more than 2.9 stars on Yelp, but I have to say now - This is completely justified (if not even overrated). I rate my experience at restaurants on the basis of 3 components (Food, Service, Speed):  - Food (2.0) Appetizer: The Nachos we ordered as appetizers were okay for bar food, but not worth $11! Processed Cheese that didn't taste like anything, and soaked through Nachos is what we got. Not overly impressed. Entrees: my husband and one of our friends had the Imperial chicken and SHRIMP, but the kitchen staff apparently forgot to put even a single piece of shrimp in there. They ate it anyway, because at that point we had waited for our food for 40 minutes already (and for a table for about 40 minutes as well). I ordered the Steak Tips with Mashed Potatoes off of the skinny menu (because earlier Yelp reviews scared me, mentioning the high calorie content of the regular menu;)). The steak was drenched in salt (and I am not a picky eater, neither a person who cares about their sodium intake), and the asparagus tasted moldy. I complained and had the waiter bring me a completely unsalted version of the steak tips. It took 30 minutes until I received it (and the others were already done eating). This second attempt was less salty, but had the consistency of a shoe sole (veeeeery chewy). I ate it anyway (at least the mashed potatoes), because at this point it was 8:50pm (ish) already. Apparently that is what you get for trying to eat healthier ;) stupid me! - Service (1.0) We (a party of 5) came in at 7pm and they told us we would have a waiting time of 55 minutes. We kind of expected that and went to the bar to grab an appetizer and a drink. (at this point I should mention that one of our friends is pregnant and cannot eat certain foods, such as not pasteurized cheeses). We ordered the Nachos with cheese and asked our waitress what kind of cheese it is, to make sure our friend could eat it, too. The waitress just looked at us and said ""well, it's melted and shredded cheese"". After that we asked again what KIND of cheese it is, and she just went on explaining that it is a melted cheese blend. She obviously had no idea, but did not consider asking the kitchen staff as well.  When our buzzer went off, my husband and I went to check out the table, while our friends cashed out at the bar. The lady responsible for seating the customers led us to a table for 2, which obviously was not big enough. She apologized and had the staff put together two small tables, which was still way too small and barely fit all our plates (the high tops at the bar were bigger than this table). As for our entrees: my husband ordered Bang Bang Chicken, but they didn't have that anymore, so he switched to the Imperial Chicken and Shrimp, but asked the waiter if he could get grilled chicken instead of breaded chicken. The waiter asked in the kitchen and came back explaining ""we can do it, but it will probably take away from the taste. When we use breading, we bread the chicken. When we don't bread it, I have no idea if it is still as good. You will have to order it at your own risk"" (great statement, right?:P). - Speed (2.0) as mentioned before it took about 40 minutes until we got our entrees (and we didn't order fancy stuff), and an additional 30 minutes for my second try with the steak tips. Bottom line: Probably good food if it were a bar, but I would have expected more from the Cheesecake Factory. Insanely overpriced and salty and fatty. We didn't get to try the cheesecake in the end, because we were so annoyed, and some of us very full (the portions are insanely big!). I know for sure that we will not go back there.

376,Virginia C.,"Grand Blanc, MI",1,10,16.0,4.0,2015-06-11,"First time at this Cheesecake Factory and I'm pleasantly surprised. I used to love Cheesecake Factory when we traveled outside of Michigan, but started hating it because of the endless menu and huge portions. But my experience today was pretty nice. We had calamari and the French country salad for an appetizer. The calamari was hot, crispy, and not too salty and was fried in clean oil. The salad was alright nothing too special. I ordered it for the beets but the beets were underdone for my taste.  I ordered a lunch portion of spaghetti and meatballs, but as expected it was still a huge portion. It was very delicious. The noodles were perfectly al dente, the sauce had a strong basil flavor, and the meatballs were meaty and soft without being mealy. The only thing is that it needed a little bit more sauce. The fried basil garnish was a nice touch. Also everything was hot as food should be.  The jambalaya Cajun pasta was a little disappointing. Very spicy, but that was about the only flavor it had. The grilled steak medallions on the ""skinnylicious"" menu was the only thing we ordered that was a reasonable portion size. I purposefully never order low fat, low carb, lighter fare options based on the concern that the food will lack flavor, but it seems that the lighter fare menu here is just slightly lower fat, but mainly smaller portions. Which is wonderful.  Our server did a nice job as well. Polite and attentive. However I didn't like that we had to ask for bread instead of it just being provided. But don't hesitate to ask for it. The brown bread they have doesn't seem to be a rye bread, but it has a sweet chocolate flavor, which sounds weird but I had nearly 3 pieces, with butter oops...  Oh also we shared a tiramisu cheesecake which was so so good. I couldn't believe how yummy it was. It was a little lighter than a typical cheesecake which was needed after a big lunch.  Overall great experience. Would come again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-novi?start=160,3.04,3.19,3.216,2.7039999999999997,3.13

The experience however from location to location is much more variable. This location lost major points on a few fronts: Firstly, they were out of all burgers, turkey, salmon and a few other items on the menu. Seriously, that's almost half the menu?!?! Um, okay... Secondly, while it's great that there was outdoor seating, whenever the wind blew in a certain direction, we were overwhelmed by a pungent garbage smell. No exactly appetizing. Lastly, the service was underwhelming. I hope given everything else that we were just there on an ""off"" night, but it took a while for our server to take our order, bring our order, refill beverages, etc. The poor man looked ready to call it a day and just quit on the spot.

We have dined here three times since they opened at 12 Oaks Mall.  We didn't go for the first time until last summer, because of the long waits.  As someone else stated, this place is good, but not wait 3 hours good.  I wouldn't really wait more than 30 minutes for this place. The food here is really good with large portions.  As someone else stated, everything is surprisingly good, but it is also really high in calories.  I am pretty sure I doubled my caloric intake just by eating one meal.  The nice thing is that my wife and I usually will split a meal because the portions are so big and you really have to leave room for the cheesecake. The cheesecake is really good, although really expensive for a piece of cheesecake.  I am pretty sure you can buy a pretty good whole cheesecake somewhere else.  We are not huge fans of cheesecake, but ""when in Rome""....maybe ""when in the Cheesecake Factory""?  Anyway, it is really rich and even when we split a piece, there is some left over.  Last time we got it with ice cream and the ice cream was amazing.  We might actually just get ice cream next time. The reason for only getting 3 stars is because of the overpriced items, the close quarters, and the mediocre service.  As stated by others, this place squeezes you in like coach class in a Spirit flight.  You definitely feel like you are sitting at a table with strangers, which may be customary in Europe, but not in America.  The waitstaff all three times have been just alright.  There are long wait times for bread, refills, and the waitstaff we have had has lacked any type of enthusiasm.  I have actually felt more welcomed at a Denny's. Overall, this is a good ""once and a while"" type place.  We usually come here for special occasions like birthdays or Mother's days.  If you do come, I suggest splitting a meal and probably a cheesecake as well.  In the end, if it is good enough for Sheldon Cooper it should be good enough for you!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-novi?start=140,2.96,2.97,3.168,2.9240000000000004,2.966

Each time i've been there, there is usually a wait. This last time however we came in for an early dinner and were seated immediately. Unfortunately they sat us on the patio where we were sardined in amongst the other patrons. It really felt like I was seated at a table with a couple in the middle of their dinner because that's how close we were. It took almost 15 minutes before our waitress even came to take our drink order and another 15 for her to come back and get the rest of our order. As we waited our stomachs quickly reminded us that we had not received the bread basket they always give us. Looking around I see only *some* tables have them.

While placing an order to-go for an elderly individual who is wheelchair bond, the representative Deani explained to me that she could not place the order for this person unless she can physically see them. I explained that the person is waiting outside the restaurant because they are unable to come into the restaurant due to the crowd and lack of mobility to move around.

Next, I am understand that because this is only location in Michigan there will be a wait, heck at every Cheesecake Factory their is a wait, but over a 2 hour wait during a weekday afternoon is ridicules. However, once seated the food leaves much to be desired. It's not your traditional Factory level food.  Lastly, the hostess and the to-go sections of the restaurant need additional training. While placing an order to-go for an elderly individual who is wheelchair bond, the representative Deani explained to me that she could not place the order for this person unless she can physically see them. I explained that the person is waiting outside the restaurant because they are unable to come into the restaurant due to the crowd and lack of mobility to move around. She then said, ""well have them role in and then have them stand-up out of their chair so that I may see them."" After that statement, I left the restaurant. It truly sad that Michigan finally received a great restaurant during their reconstruction and it's one of my favorite restaurants as well, but after this I believe my love for Cheesecake Factory has come to an end!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-novi?start=180,3.2,3.22,3.188,2.724,3.2120000000000006

This place was a huge addition to Twelve Oaks. I went with a couple friends, and this was my first time to a Cheesecake Factory. It was a year after they opened so there was no crazy wait time, and it was summer, so they had very nice outdoor seating. We ended up sitting outside, it was a very nice day. We sat under a big umbrella in what was like a big outdoor booth. I ordered the pretzel crusted chicken strips, which is an appetizer. I didn't enjoy them as much as I thought I would, and the presentation wasn't exactly appetizing... They were served on wood skewers and one of them broke inside the chicken, so I was afraid I was going to eat part of the stick. This is why I gave four out of five stars! The waitress was great, even when she was waiting on multiple tables she made time to refill our drinks quickly and was knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered cheesecake, and I am not a cheesecake person, but I tried a couple bites, and it was great. It was the S'Mores cheesecake, it looked almost too good to eat, but we devoured it within minutes.

It immediately freaked me out, but my sisters tried to reason with me and suggested that maybe they spray the tables down with bleach and that was sufficient for me if it was the case. While we were waiting to order the waitress brought our drinks and proceeded to set UNWRAPPED STRAWS ON THE TABLE. Again, I thought okay, they must clean these tables well. I mean, how could they get away with putting these items on the bare table after people have rubbed their hands and arms all over the table, perhaps maybe sneezed or spat during dinner -  they MUST use a bleach spray. While we continued to wait to order we watched the bus boy ""clean"" off the table next to us. The procedure was as follows: He took the dry looking towel out of the back of his sweaty apron, brushed the crumbs on to the floor, wiped off the booths and chairs (where peoples butts belong) wiped the table again and then set it. SO, your silverware and straws are sitting on a table that was not sprayed with a cleaning solution, wiped with a towel from the bus boys back, dragged across the germs from someones tush and then smeared back on the table.

592,Virginia C.,"Grand Blanc, United States",1,10,16.0,4.0,2015-11-06,"First time at this Cheesecake Factory and I'm pleasantly surprised. I used to love Cheesecake Factory when we traveled outside of Michigan, but started hating it because of the endless menu and huge portions. But my experience today was pretty nice. We had calamari and the French country salad for an appetizer. The calamari was hot, crispy, and not too salty and was fried in clean oil. The salad was alright nothing too special. I ordered it for the beets but the beets were underdone for my taste.  I ordered a lunch portion of spaghetti and meatballs, but as expected it was still a huge portion. It was very delicious. The noodles were perfectly al dente, the sauce had a strong basil flavor, and the meatballs were meaty and soft without being mealy. The only thing is that it needed a little bit more sauce. The fried basil garnish was a nice touch. Also everything was hot as food should be.  The jambalaya Cajun pasta was a little disappointing. Very spicy, but that was about the only flavor it had. The grilled steak medallions on the ""skinnylicious"" menu was the only thing we ordered that was a reasonable portion size. I purposefully never order low fat, low carb, lighter fare options based on the concern that the food will lack flavor, but it seems that the lighter fare menu here is just slightly lower fat, but mainly smaller portions. Which is wonderful.  Our server did a nice job as well. Polite and attentive. However I didn't like that we had to ask for bread instead of it just being provided. But don't hesitate to ask for it. The brown bread they have doesn't seem to be a rye bread, but it has a sweet chocolate flavor, which sounds weird but I had nearly 3 pieces, with butter oops...

Secondly, while it's great that there was outdoor seating, whenever the wind blew in a certain direction, we were overwhelmed by a pungent garbage smell. No exactly appetizing. Lastly, the service was underwhelming. I hope given everything else that we were just there on an ""off"" night, but it took a while for our server to take our order, bring our order, refill beverages, etc. The poor man looked ready to call it a day and just quit on the spot.

But be prepared to wait for a table, this is basically the ONLY cheesecake factory here in Michigan. So yes, people do make the pilgrimage just to have a crack at it.

Those two things, you can never go wrong. Dishes so good, you'd prolly lick the plate when you're done. Come early and put your name on the list right away.

The actual food, however, has been a hit or miss with me the times I've gone to this particular location where I've always had a good go of any other location. Expect a fair wait if you're going during prime hours friday-sunday. You might be able to shave off an hour of waiting if you jump on an open bar table, which are first come first serve, or the bar itself which is full service. The food, to get back to it, has been lacking, especially for the price, and for the life of me they aren't getting the cheesecake right. The cheesecake in question, the cookie dough one with the oreo crust, the oreo is just mushy and gross where the other locations have their oreo game on point.

577,Hassen F.,"Canton, United States",174,23,3.0,1.0,2016-04-10,"This by far has to be the chain's worst run Cheesecake Factory location we've ever visited. Now going on two years open, and after a dozen tries, this Cheesecake Factory location still has problems getting food out in a timely manner, and worse, has management that is very condescending and disingenuous. As if giving the customer a courtesy credit on their bill for dropping the ball meant some kind of hit to their paychecks. I can't figure out why on two recent occasions, two distinct managers were not very responsive to our concerns and offered nothing more than a half-hearted apology as if our legitimate complaints were nothing. On second most recent visit, my son and his girlfriend arrived and sat down about 20 minutes before we arrived. Upon sitting down, I asked my son about bread. He said they told him they were out of bread and would be up. Another 20 minutes and still no bread. The server finally showed up to take our orders, I inquired. He said it was in the oven and coming soon. His tone and attitude was less than enthusiastic. I asked how much longer. His answer: I'll bring it out as soon as it was ready"". I mentioned that it had been 45 minutes since we arrived, -how difficult was it for a restaurant like CF to have bread readily available?   Again, he gave a very condescending response, so I asked that he find a manager and an alternate server with a better attitude.  He left the table, and we soon had another server with a much better attitude.  A manager later came by, we explained the situation, and our frustration. We got a half-hearted apology and lame explanation about the bread with little or no desire to make up for the delay in delivering bread to our table or for the attitude of the server.  Not even an offer for dessert on the house--not that it was a requirement, but it would have helped. Fast forward a month later, we went back for dessert at 9:45pm after waiting 45 minutes for a table. Two slices of Cheesecake was all we ordered, It wasn't until 10:30pm that we got our desserts. At 10:10, we asked the server, and she said yes, it takes 15 minutes on average to get dessert, and she went to check on them. She disappeared for more than 20 minutes when the desserts finally showed up at our table at 10:30, a full 45 minutes after our arrival. A manager finally came around the table who said that she had heard that we had a concern about a 15 minute time frame to receive desserts. She said this is normal. When I said it had taken 45 minutes, she said, ""Oh, I heard it was only 15 minutes. I suggested she check to see when our order had been entered into the system to resolve this discrepancy. She offered us a complimentary coffee or beverage (at 10:30pm) if we liked and we declined. We felt she too was disingenuous and insincere. We've been to Cheesecake Factories in Chicago, LA, Miami, Pasadena, Irvine, Schaumburg, etc., and never once have we had the kind of problems we've had at the Novi, MI location. It's sad, because this is where we live. It will be long time before we ever come back. These weren't our first times with issues with this location, but it seems management is more the problem than the help as they don't seem to want to be part of the solution. It doesn't take much to take ownership of things that go wrong.

She told me to hold on and that she would have to get the manager for approval. I guess they cannot seat more than 6 within managers approval. We waited and waited. Approximately 15 minutes before the manager showed up. We were then told that it would be 45 minutes and was given one of the buzzer things. After 45 minutes I went back to the hostess to find out how much longer. She said that there was a party at our table that had been there for 2.5 hours already and they were expecting them to leave any minute. Well 15 minutes later they were still sitting there. She then proceeded to offer us a table for 6 and another table for two kiddy corner from the table for 6.   I said absolutely not. We were celebrating a birthday and wanted to seat together. Finally after another 20 minutes the people started acting like they were going to leave. We finally got our table and was able to order our meal. The manager did come to the table and gave us 2 appetizers for free. But the issue that I have is that they don't have the capability to seat a large party.

Like any other Cheesecake Factory, you have a massive, somewhat overpriced menu to order from that has something for anyone. The actual food, however, has been a hit or miss with me the times I've gone to this particular location where I've always had a good go of any other location. Expect a fair wait if you're going during prime hours friday-sunday. You might be able to shave off an hour of waiting if you jump on an open bar table, which are first come first serve, or the bar itself which is full service. The food, to get back to it, has been lacking, especially for the price, and for the life of me they aren't getting the cheesecake right. The cheesecake in question, the cookie dough one with the oreo crust, the oreo is just mushy and gross where the other locations have their oreo game on point.

I placed my drink order which only consisted of water with lemons. I also ordered a burger med well with fries and crab and spinach dip. The crab dip was to die for.

Instead of apologizing and being nice, he came out first arguing about our wait time down to the minutes, then arguing that there was an error in how I ordered the meal, then last he tried to rectify the situation by giving us a slice of cheesecake.

I saw the vinaigrette but couldn't taste it whatsoever. Took awhile to get our server to order a different dressing. I went for the peanut lime dressing they have which was much better.

361,Hassen F.,"Canton, MI",174,23,3.0,1.0,2016-10-04,"This by far has to be the chain's worst run Cheesecake Factory location we've ever visited. Now going on two years open, and after a dozen tries, this Cheesecake Factory location still has problems getting food out in a timely manner, and worse, has management that is very condescending and disingenuous. As if giving the customer a courtesy credit on their bill for dropping the ball meant some kind of hit to their paychecks. I can't figure out why on two recent occasions, two distinct managers were not very responsive to our concerns and offered nothing more than a half-hearted apology as if our legitimate complaints were nothing. On second most recent visit, my son and his girlfriend arrived and sat down about 20 minutes before we arrived. Upon sitting down, I asked my son about bread. He said they told him they were out of bread and would be up. Another 20 minutes and still no bread. The server finally showed up to take our orders, I inquired. He said it was in the oven and coming soon. His tone and attitude was less than enthusiastic. I asked how much longer. His answer: I'll bring it out as soon as it was ready"". I mentioned that it had been 45 minutes since we arrived, -how difficult was it for a restaurant like CF to have bread readily available?   Again, he gave a very condescending response, so I asked that he find a manager and an alternate server with a better attitude.  He left the table, and we soon had another server with a much better attitude.  A manager later came by, we explained the situation, and our frustration. We got a half-hearted apology and lame explanation about the bread with little or no desire to make up for the delay in delivering bread to our table or for the attitude of the server.  Not even an offer for dessert on the house--not that it was a requirement, but it would have helped. Fast forward a month later, we went back for dessert at 9:45pm after waiting 45 minutes for a table. Two slices of Cheesecake was all we ordered, It wasn't until 10:30pm that we got our desserts. At 10:10, we asked the server, and she said yes, it takes 15 minutes on average to get dessert, and she went to check on them. She disappeared for more than 20 minutes when the desserts finally showed up at our table at 10:30, a full 45 minutes after our arrival. A manager finally came around the table who said that she had heard that we had a concern about a 15 minute time frame to receive desserts. She said this is normal. When I said it had taken 45 minutes, she said, ""Oh, I heard it was only 15 minutes. I suggested she check to see when our order had been entered into the system to resolve this discrepancy. She offered us a complimentary coffee or beverage (at 10:30pm) if we liked and we declined. We felt she too was disingenuous and insincere. We've been to Cheesecake Factories in Chicago, LA, Miami, Pasadena, Irvine, Schaumburg, etc., and never once have we had the kind of problems we've had at the Novi, MI location. It's sad, because this is where we live. It will be long time before we ever come back. These weren't our first times with issues with this location, but it seems management is more the problem than the help as they don't seem to want to be part of the solution.

691,Pamela S.,"Southfield, United States",6,3,,1.0,2016-10-05,We visited the Cheese Cake factory 5/5/2016. We were celebrating my daughters 29 birthday. When we first arrived i went up to the reservation desk and the hostess asked me how many in my party. I advised that there were 6 adults and 2 children. She told me to hold on and that she would have to get the manager for approval. I guess they cannot seat more than 6 within managers approval. We waited and waited. Approximately 15 minutes before the manager showed up. We were then told that it would be 45 minutes and was given one of the buzzer things. After 45 minutes I went back to the hostess to find out how much longer. She said that there was a party at our table that had been there for 2.5 hours already and they were expecting them to leave any minute. Well 15 minutes later they were still sitting there. She then proceeded to offer us a table for 6 and another table for two kiddy corner from the table for 6.   I said absolutely not. We were celebrating a birthday and wanted to seat together. Finally after another 20 minutes the people started acting like they were going to leave. We finally got our table and was able to order our meal. The manager did come to the table and gave us 2 appetizers for free. But the issue that I have is that they don't have the capability to seat a large party. What restaurant has to get permission to seat more than 6 people. Come on Cheese Cake Factory you are supposed to be a restaurant. This situation was handled very poorly. I will never return.

The layout was a little different then most I've been too, and it seemed they crammed as many tables as possible so any type of personal space is void.  Our server was nice and knowledgeable. We started with the spinach artichoke appetizer and a glass of sangria and a blood orange margarita. Both drinks we good but the glass was jammed with ice of course. For as much as they charge you can let up a little. The appetizer was okay, I should have gone with something else.  I ordered the blackened Jamaican chicken and shrimp which wasn't too bad, I have to say it was well cooked. The beau ordered the Chicken Madeira and Steak combo with mashed potatoes. Not the best we've had but it wasn't bad. Of course most come for the cheesecake. I took the pumpkin pecan and he got the godiva to go.

It was quite some time ago, but the experience was very good. It's not just a place for you to order up cheesecakes. Their food is actually very good. But be prepared to wait for a table, this is basically the ONLY cheesecake factory here in Michigan. So yes, people do make the pilgrimage just to have a crack at it. Appetizer of choice,, the chicken samosas. Those things are addictive, trust me on that. Then entree' of choice for me would be the Chicken Marsala or the Shepherds Pie. Those two things, you can never go wrong. Dishes so good, you'd prolly lick the plate when you're done. Come early and put your name on the list right away. Go shopping and just check from time to time to see if your time has shortened. I always expect a bit of wait, just because I wouldn't be shocked if there was one.

550,Brian P.,"Harrison charter Township, United States",0,8,,2.0,2016-11-28,"I really used to love this place.  It's an hour from home, there's always a 2 hour wait, no reservations, no call ahead seating.. but, it's usually good food and a good selection, especially their small bites and apps.  This time I ended up having to argue with my waitress which was very awkward and I won't return. I'll just get down to it: Told 40 minute wait.. was over an hour.  Ok, whatever.  We get seated around 7 on a Sunday (didn't get out until after 9).  Of course we're put in those row booths with chairs on the other side so you're about 6 inches from the people next to you.  There are 3 of us including a toddler which makes you want a little privacy so the kid's not bugging people.  They don't care about that there. 10 minute wait for drink and I was very thirsty after waiting for over an hour to be seated.  It's not a terribly long wait.  30 minute wait for bread.   Ordered the crab cake bites.  Really good and a good price.  Didn't wait long for those. Next.  Ordered the fish tacos for dinner.  Wife had the shrimp and salmon combination.  Kid had the bowtie pasta with butter and parmesan. My wife's dish came out 5 minutes before the rest.  Whatever. Kids pasta was ok.  A LOT of butter for a kid's dish.  We didn't get the included drink.  Probably would have ordered a milk.  A lot of places also offer a veggie or something.  Not here.  $7 for something I could make for 50 cents.  3 ingredients.  Pretty easy.  Wife's fish was nice and moist.  Shrimp tasty.   Mashed potatoes were really good.  But there were only 3 small shrimp and about a 4 ounce piece of fish.  I recall large portions at Cheesecake Factory and always bringing food home... no longer.  And, for $22 I expected at least 4 shrimp?   Finally, fish tacos, bleh.  Fish was ok.  The salsa stuff didn't have much flavor.  They forgot the avocado... I told my waitress when she brought our desert after checking the menu to confirm.  She just acknowledged it and I asked her to tell them they forgot it.  Fish tacos without avocado... maybe it's small, but I would have ordered one of the other 500 things on the menu if i knew there would be no avocado.  Anyway, she gave us the bill.  Kind of snuck it under my arm.  I found her and told her that I wasn't happy and asked if she told a manager.  I said all this waiting and a relatively expensive dinner I expect my dish to be correct.  She told me if I had told her during dinner she would have fixed it.. well, she had disappeared for 10 minutes after the food came so I had already eaten half the meal.  Then she asked what I wanted her to do... that the manager would ask the same thing.  Really?  You screw something up and expect the customer to have to ask for something?  I at least expected a manager to come and apologize.  Offer a free drink, desert, something.  I told her to let the manager decide and she gave us the kid's meal for free.  Still, no manager came and said a word.  She didn't apologize and just handed us the check.  10% tip instead of 20% right there.  Be nice and fix the problem and it would have been 25%.

114,Brian P.,"Harrison charter Township, MI",0,8,,2.0,2016-11-28,"I really used to love this place.  It's an hour from home, there's always a 2 hour wait, no reservations, no call ahead seating.. but, it's usually good food and a good selection, especially their small bites and apps.  This time I ended up having to argue with my waitress which was very awkward and I won't return. I'll just get down to it: Told 40 minute wait.. was over an hour.  Ok, whatever.  We get seated around 7 on a Sunday (didn't get out until after 9).  Of course we're put in those row booths with chairs on the other side so you're about 6 inches from the people next to you.  There are 3 of us including a toddler which makes you want a little privacy so the kid's not bugging people.  They don't care about that there. 10 minute wait for drink and I was very thirsty after waiting for over an hour to be seated.  It's not a terribly long wait.  30 minute wait for bread.   Ordered the crab cake bites.  Really good and a good price.  Didn't wait long for those. Next.  Ordered the fish tacos for dinner.  Wife had the shrimp and salmon combination.  Kid had the bowtie pasta with butter and parmesan. My wife's dish came out 5 minutes before the rest.  Whatever. Kids pasta was ok.  A LOT of butter for a kid's dish.  We didn't get the included drink.  Probably would have ordered a milk.  A lot of places also offer a veggie or something.  Not here.  $7 for something I could make for 50 cents.  3 ingredients.  Pretty easy.

Instead of just getting me a water, he first tries to locate the server and by then he's on his way. I can tell the server is irritated that I asked for my water and so he hands the water to the manager. After a few minutes after, he hands me lemons and cold bread. I said thanks.

My daughter's orange chicken meal came as requested but had no sauce, my meal came and was loaded with hot peppers! 10 minutes later our guacamole finally came and was loaded with jalapeños. After talking with the waitress I was informed they couldn't eliminate the peppers from my dish (although she originally said we could) so I reordered a new entree which at the same time we requested the sauce that was missing from my daughter's meal. By the time she received her sauce (20 min later) her entire meal was ice cold and I was still waiting for mine! I tried to eat some of the guacamole as I waited, but just too hot for my liking.  By the time I received my meal my daughter had been long done trying to eat hers as she barely ate any, too cold and just lost her appetite from the experience.

The chocolate cheesecake itself was still covered with frost after a 3 hour drive in a warm car. You could tell that it was in deep freeze, because it was even sweaty from de-thawing but still had so much that a mountain of freezerburn-frost still remained. The cheesecake was very dry and crumbly and it wasn't even that chocolaty. It was hard, dry, and tasted like dust. The other 2 cheesecakes were okay, but nothing special. They didn't look nearly as good as the pictures as they varied with toppings. They were significantly less freezer burnt, but still had that essence to them.

235,G I N.,"Macomb, MI",6,127,1183.0,3.0,2017-05-12,"The Cheesecake Factory is a well known franchise with locations in several states. Famous for their Cheesecakes, the restaurant also boasts over 250 menu items from appetizers and salads to pizza, pasta, sandwiches, and steak, you'll be sure to find something that you're craving. But if you're boasting about a 250+ menu selection, it's most likely many variations of a core dish. Either that or the Chef has a serious repertoire, no, an arsenal of mad skills. After perusing the menu, I've concluded that it was the former not the latter. With over 40 types of cheesecake alone, dessert easily makes up 20% of the menu.  The only location in MI is at Twelve Oaks Mall in Novi. It's been there for a few years now (Nov. 2013), and the place is still insanely packed. They do not take reservations so it's first come first serve. Wait times faltered slightly and you're looking at about 2,5 hrs wait during peak times. Do yourself a favour and avoid the peak period, you'll get a table fairly easy (30-45 mins tops). If you don't mind having ""Linner"", go between 14:00-16:00 and you'll be seated relatively quick. The semi good news is that you can walk around the mall for a bit, but don't go for too long, the buzzer is really a short range device, covering 300 feet if you're lucky. That'll get you as far as the unmanned information booth. Walk the mall, just come back 15 mins or so before your appointed wait time is over. Crispy Crab Bites. These deep fried mouth-size balls were surprisingly better than anticipated. The breading did not absorb too much oil and the filling did consist of actual crab. Ratio between crab and filler was about 50/50. The dipping sauce was a creamy mustard-based sauce that didn't have any signs of spice to it so it's even safe for kids. A pleasant surprise. 4,0 stars. Ahi Tartare. Sashimi grade tuna atop an avacado base topped with a blossom of ginger, accompanied by crispy wonton wrappers. The sauce is your traditional soy, vinegar, ginger mix garnished with cilantro. The vinegar taste was super light, with little to no acidity. The portion was a little lacking even for one, but it tasted as good as it looked. 4,0 stars. BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad. This salad is ginormous! Easily feeding 4, the salad comes deconstructed so it's great for sharing as you can build it your way on your own plate. Visually it's appealing with romaine, black beans, corn, cucumber, tomato, avocado, diced chicken, and crispy fried onion strings topping the dish. The romaine lettuce was fresh and crisp, and the dressing is a combination of BBQ and Ranch. While it doesn't sound like a good combination, it fared decently when everything was tossed together. 3,5 stars Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. Served with rice, beans, plantains, and pineapple. The shrimp were a decent size (31-40 ct), and the dish did carry some heat. The marinated pineapple, and the plantains were a good complement with the sweetness offsetting the spice from the shrimp. The rice was long grain and not overcooked. 3,0 stars Pasta Carbonara. I added chicken to this dish for protein (+$3). Smoked bacon & green peas were the only other ingredients on this simple dish. The sauce was a garlic parmesan cream. When it arrived, it was still warm, but looked like it was under the lamps a bit as the pasta was drying out. Aged Parmagiana shavings would have been a nice garnish, despite fresh parmesan being used for the sauce. 3,0 stars.  Known for their cheesecakes, they did not disappoint. While the specialty toppings and ingredients did add elements of flavour and texture to the dish as a whole, they also contributed greatly to blood sugar levels and calories.  Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. 3,0 stars. Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake. 3,0 stars. Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake. 3,5 stars. Plain Cheesecake: 4,5 stars. Overall, I'd probably rate Cheesecake factory 3,5 stars. They definitely have a range of ratings based on the course, with Apps and Desserts faring better than their entrees. But adding the value factor and wait times would result in rounding down rather than up. Overall, the prices are on the high end for what you get. The wait times are seldomly short, which does nothing to help its plight. 3,0 stars. Tip: Place your dessert order 20-30 mins before the end of your meal as the Dessert Cafe also handles all take out orders and gets backed up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-novi?start=20,2.6,2.21,2.36,2.8920000000000003,2.366

It's clear the chefs here need to be completely retrained!!! This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever had and after our last visit I won't be back. My fiancée and I both ordered pasta, I got my usual  Cajun jambalaya pasta, my fiancée got the 4 cheese pasta with linguini instead of penne and added shrimp. Both of our pasta's were VERY salty and lacked any kind of real flavor. Basically they were soaked in salt water. We have both ordered these dishes regularly and have never experienced anything like this before. The waitress did warn me and say another customer complained about the jambalaya pasta being too salty, but I said that's okay I order it all the time. Unfortunately I was wrong, and the pasta was in fact way too salty. It was obvious the chef had no idea how to add flavor to this dish and just loaded it with salt water. We went on a Wednesday night and it was pretty busy. It's clear this location does HORRIBLE when it's busy. The chefs get too overwhelmed and just rush everything. Please hire new chefs, and until you do we will not be back. So incredibly disappointing Cheesecake Factory. This location is the worst. Updated to 1 star, but I would give it zero stars if it were possible. I love Cheesecake Factory, but I hate this location and this poor excuse of a Cheesecake Factory restaurant. Unfortunately I don't expect this location to change, because all the bad reviews on here ever get is the basic, old, tired corporate response with nothing really done about it.   My fiancée and I love Cheesecake Factory, but after dining at this location I've realized the food is no where near what we are use to. I recently moved to Michigan from New Jersey, and Cheesecake Factory has been a restaurant my fiancée and I enjoy going to quite often especially for date night. Anytime we go our bill is $100 or more for the two of us.  Let me start by saying this review has nothing to do with the wait or the service and everything to do with the food. The wait was 25 minutes which wasn't bad for a Friday night. It's clear Cheesecake Factory is very popular here and I doubt this location or bad review will hurt the restaurant, but I'll share anyway in hopes of improvement. Anyways, we are use to about a 30-45 minute wait for Cheesecake Factory so 25 minutes wasn't  bad. Our waitress wasn't bad either. Drinks were good. The crab wonton appetizer was fine, dessert was the usual great Cheesecake that Cheesecake Factory provides. However, the entrees were the biggest disappointment for us. I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya pasta and my fiancée ordered the orange chicken. For the jambalaya pasta I kid you not ONLY TWO SHRIMP in the entire dish!!! I order this pasta all of the time and there is always a good 8-10 shrimp in the pasta. I thought maybe the shrimp was buried in the pasta somewhere, NOPE!!! The spice also was no where near what I'm use to and was very plain tasting. It tasted like it was missing something. The orange chicken looked like they cooked a bunch up and gave my fiancée the scraps. When she had this dish at other cheesecake factory's we always rave about how big the pieces of chicken are. What we got here were tiny pieces of chicken that it looked like no one else wanted. Like if you ordered catering and were left the small pieces at the bottom. Overall a major disappointment. We wanted to say something, but figured it wouldn't do much good. Unfortunately this Cheesecake Factory doesn't do the restaurant justice at all. If only all the customers who came here knew what they were really missing out on. I understand it was a Friday night and they were busy, but there is no excuse for only giving two shrimp and the last of the chicken. I'd like to think it was an off night and give the restaurant another shot, but I don't think I could allow myself to be ripped off out of shrimp like that again.

I can't believe i even found them because In that specific salad it had corn, beans, cheese,chicken,tortillas and tomatoes. I then asked to see the manger. He came out and confirmed it was a piece of wool from the cleaning crew. He did say sorry and offered me a different dish and a dessert and I said I didn't want another dish but I'd take the dessert to go. The manger didn't seem to sorry and was very unprofessional about the situation. I would of gave everyone that was with me a free dessert and also took care of thier Meals as well for free.

Food was good when we finally got our correct meals. My husband's Burger was overcooked, they were out of my Salmon so I had to order something else. Then come to find out they weren't out of the Salmon so I ended up getting it about ten minutes after my husband received his meal which he then had to send back. On to the rest though. The menu is extensive! Give yourself time to peruse. There literally is something for everyone. If you can't find something here I'm not even sure what to say. Of course there is dessert(cheesecake) hence the name. And they are good, big slices and tons of different varieties. My favorite is the Banana Cream.   They have a great menu with healthy alternatives and the nutrition calculated called the Skinnylicious menu, it's the menu I stick with. Their Tuscan Chicken with Tomatoes, Artichokes, Capers and Balsamic is a favorite I also love the Salmon. For appetizers I love the summer rolls and the Thai lettuce wraps are​ good.

My kid loved the mashed potatoes and my fiancé got the chicken Madeira which was amazing as well. I myself got Sheppards pie which was very good.  Well halfway through my meal i looked over and there was a bug on the table. I don't know how long it was there for but my awesome waitress called someone over to clean it up. Her name was Stephanie and she did an amazing job!  However; as bad as the bug situation was I kind of looked past it. The icing on the cake where it went bad was when the gentleman wiped it off the table and lifted it OVER the top of my plate. I am not one to get someone in trouble so i stopped eating immediately and had my waitress box up my food to be nice and pretend nothing happened. When a different waitress walked by I asked her to discard the food and just get rid of it.  The food was great don't get me wrong. This was just a bad experience for our first time here.

In my former CF experiences, the wait was long, the food was so so and the service was always decent. And for the strangest reason, nothing off of that gigantic menu ever seemed to sit well in my stomach.  This Friday, I met up with some girlfriends and was looking forward to a great night. For starters, the wait was finally reasonable! 30 minutes for a Friday night. Huge contrast to the one and two hour waits that used to be the norm.  For starters, I ordered the fried Mac and cheese and for my entree I had the southwest chicken sandwich (not sure if that's the actual name but you get the gist lol).  We were so caught up in conversation that I never realized my appetizer never came out and suddenly our entrees began to appear. Our server (I want to say her name was Mandy) came and asked if I ever got it - apparently there was a mix up in the kitchen but they offered the app to me on the house! Who doesn't love FREE fried cheese! I'm all in. My sandwich was good, I REALLY enjoyed my salad. I think it might've been the balsamic dressing...but whatever it was it was the bomb. Fried Mac was also good as well. Fast forward to the end of the night, I noticed my app wasn't taken off the bill, and of course I had to overthink myself into wanting to make a big fuss on a busy Friday....so I didn't say anything. It's the thought that counts right? I assumed she must've put everything in as we ordered and forgot to comp it maybe? Either way I appreciated the effort to make things right - my fault for not opening my mouth to do anything but shovel more fried cheese into my face!  Rounded everything out with raspberry lemon cheesecake, which is proving to be my favorite cheesecake that they offer. AND to top it all off, no stomachache! I couldn't believe it.

46,Dan F.,"Farmington Hills, MI",0,7,,1.0,2017-08-28,"Surreal! I asked my family to take me there for my birthday, and it turned out to be a disaster. To start, we were told it would be a 45-60 minute wait. Now, this isn't atypical for this location, but since they're still on the old fashioned pager system instead of a proper text alert system like so many restaurants are embracing (and with their consistently long wait times, it's obscene that they haven't switched), we were stuck waiting near the place for that time, lest we go too far and lose our spot. It took nearly 85 minutes to get a table. Why? Their dishwasher broke, and supposedly they were having trouble getting clean dishes out to people as a result; a fact the hostess failed to tell me about when I checked in at the 45 minute mark, when she insisted it'd only be another 10 minutes. We got told at the 70 minute mark. So by the time we sit down, the whole family is pretty hungry and grumpy. I will say, our waiter took good care of us. He was polite, and efficient. He was the only redeeming factor of the evening. I ordered the Factory burrito, which turned out very bland and even a bit cold. My dad, however, got the shaft big time. He ordered the fish and chips, which were not only cold, but tasted like the sat in the oil way too long. After he sent it back and requested an order of chicken fingers, we all split our plates with him so he wouldn't sit there empty handed, but it was another 25 minutes before we gave up on the chicken fingers. We managed to get the fish and chips taken off the bill, and the chicken fingers came in literally as we were getting up from the table.  I would give them 1 1/2 stars, because I liked the waiter, and he at least tried to make it right for us, but overall, this was a lousy experience. By the time we were done, I didn't even want a slice of cheesecake, which was half the reason I came in the first place.

They also don't take reservations - I'm sure this is a corporate policy but to tell people that you cannot make a reservation for a large group coming from out of town is absurd.  There should always be exceptions to the rule for these situations, as many other restaurants have. Instead the policy is ""you and your 8 guests will have to drive two hours and then stand in line for 4 more hours to eat - because we hate people using our establishment for special occasions and don't want your business.""

My husband and I have ordered the same thing for the last 3 years: the BBQ chicken salad.  Every time we go, the salad quality diminishes significantly. For example, they used to put a ton of chicken, corn, black beans, etc. on the salad. Now, they put such little portions of each that it tastes like I'm eating purely lettuce.  Just to put it in perspective, we used to drive 45 minutes just to get this salad as ""take out"" because we liked it so much. Now, we don't even consider going here anymore.

I used to love going out of town and being able to visit. Now there's one in my own State yet I hardly go. Stopped in tonight since we were busy running errands. Food was good when we finally got our correct meals. My husband's Burger was overcooked, they were out of my Salmon so I had to order something else. Then come to find out they weren't out of the Salmon so I ended up getting it about ten minutes after my husband received his meal which he then had to send back. On to the rest though. The menu is extensive! Give yourself time to peruse. There literally is something for everyone. If you can't find something here I'm not even sure what to say. Of course there is dessert(cheesecake) hence the name. And they are good, big slices and tons of different varieties. My favorite is the Banana Cream.   They have a great menu with healthy alternatives and the nutrition calculated called the Skinnylicious menu, it's the menu I stick with. Their Tuscan Chicken with Tomatoes, Artichokes, Capers and Balsamic is a favorite I also love the Salmon. For appetizers I love the summer rolls and the Thai lettuce wraps are​ good. They have happy hour from 4-6 with food choices as well as drink specials. I like the Artichoke if they don't burn them which sometimes they do.

I got the Santa Fe chicken salad( lunch portion) My girlfriend got the spicy cashew chicken with white rice and my other girlfriend got the Chinese chicken salad. When I got mine the Santa Fe salad, I started to eat it until I saw some black/silver shiny wool/metal piece in it. I then took out one long piece and then continued to look and found another black piece. I can't believe i even found them because In that specific salad it had corn, beans, cheese,chicken,tortillas and tomatoes. I then asked to see the manger. He came out and confirmed it was a piece of wool from the cleaning crew. He did say sorry and offered me a different dish and a dessert and I said I didn't want another dish but I'd take the dessert to go. The manger didn't seem to sorry and was very unprofessional about the situation. I would of gave everyone that was with me a free dessert and also took care of thier Meals as well for free.

511,G I N.,"Macomb, United States",6,127,1183.0,3.0,2017-12-05,"The Cheesecake Factory is a well known franchise with locations in several states. Famous for their Cheesecakes, the restaurant also boasts over 250 menu items from appetizers and salads to pizza, pasta, sandwiches, and steak, you'll be sure to find something that you're craving. But if you're boasting about a 250+ menu selection, it's most likely many variations of a core dish. Either that or the Chef has a serious repertoire, no, an arsenal of mad skills. After perusing the menu, I've concluded that it was the former not the latter. With over 40 types of cheesecake alone, dessert easily makes up 20% of the menu.  The only location in MI is at Twelve Oaks Mall in Novi. It's been there for a few years now (Nov. 2013), and the place is still insanely packed. They do not take reservations so it's first come first serve. Wait times faltered slightly and you're looking at about 2,5 hrs wait during peak times. Do yourself a favour and avoid the peak period, you'll get a table fairly easy (30-45 mins tops). If you don't mind having ""Linner"", go between 14:00-16:00 and you'll be seated relatively quick. The semi good news is that you can walk around the mall for a bit, but don't go for too long, the buzzer is really a short range device, covering 300 feet if you're lucky. That'll get you as far as the unmanned information booth. Walk the mall, just come back 15 mins or so before your appointed wait time is over. Crispy Crab Bites. These deep fried mouth-size balls were surprisingly better than anticipated. The breading did not absorb too much oil and the filling did consist of actual crab. Ratio between crab and filler was about 50/50. The dipping sauce was a creamy mustard-based sauce that didn't have any signs of spice to it so it's even safe for kids. A pleasant surprise. 4,0 stars. Ahi Tartare. Sashimi grade tuna atop an avacado base topped with a blossom of ginger, accompanied by crispy wonton wrappers. The sauce is your traditional soy, vinegar, ginger mix garnished with cilantro. The vinegar taste was super light, with little to no acidity. The portion was a little lacking even for one, but it tasted as good as it looked. 4,0 stars. BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad. This salad is ginormous! Easily feeding 4, the salad comes deconstructed so it's great for sharing as you can build it your way on your own plate. Visually it's appealing with romaine, black beans, corn, cucumber, tomato, avocado, diced chicken, and crispy fried onion strings topping the dish. The romaine lettuce was fresh and crisp, and the dressing is a combination of BBQ and Ranch. While it doesn't sound like a good combination, it fared decently when everything was tossed together. 3,5 stars Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. Served with rice, beans, plantains, and pineapple. The shrimp were a decent size (31-40 ct), and the dish did carry some heat. The marinated pineapple, and the plantains were a good complement with the sweetness offsetting the spice from the shrimp. The rice was long grain and not overcooked. 3,0 stars Pasta Carbonara. I added chicken to this dish for protein (+$3). Smoked bacon & green peas were the only other ingredients on this simple dish. The sauce was a garlic parmesan cream. When it arrived, it was still warm, but looked like it was under the lamps a bit as the pasta was drying out. Aged Parmagiana shavings would have been a nice garnish, despite fresh parmesan being used for the sauce. 3,0 stars.  Known for their cheesecakes, they did not disappoint. While the specialty toppings and ingredients did add elements of flavour and texture to the dish as a whole, they also contributed greatly to blood sugar levels and calories.  Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. 3,0 stars. Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake. 3,0 stars. Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake. 3,5 stars. Plain Cheesecake: 4,5 stars. Overall, I'd probably rate Cheesecake factory 3,5 stars. They definitely have a range of ratings based on the course, with Apps and Desserts faring better than their entrees. But adding the value factor and wait times would result in rounding down rather than up. Overall, the prices are on the high end for what you get. The wait times are seldomly short, which does nothing to help its plight. 3,0 stars. Tip: Place your dessert order 20-30 mins before the end of your meal as the Dessert Cafe also handles all take out orders and gets backed up.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-novi?start=20,2.32,2.78,2.444,2.444,2.596
