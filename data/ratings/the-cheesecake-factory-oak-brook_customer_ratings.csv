422,Lewis W.,"Darien, IL",0,16,,5.0,2012-01-05,I've been here many many times. This is one of my favorite places. The place is gorgeous. Plenty of room and the outside dining is very comfortable.  The staff is very accommodating. They go all out to make your dining experience enjoyable. My favorite: Fettucini Alfredo. I've tried many of the dinners and desserts and everything was excellent. Highly recommend the Chicken Marsala.  I can' t say enough about this place,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=420,3.72,3.5,3.5,3.4120000000000004,3.5880000000000005
335,Fred H.,"Maywood, IL",6,40,13.0,3.0,2012-01-08,"I frequent particular location. Usually, I'm satisfied with the service. But one particular night, I called in to carry out and they answered and placed me on hold. Needless to say, I drove to the location while on hold. When I arrived and told the hostess that I'd been on hold for 11 minutes, she just replied, yup there you are on line 1. I asked to speak to a manager and she seemed embarrassed and offered me cheesecake. I declined and told her that I'd planned on carrying out but decided to just get cheesecake, which was for someone else. I did leave them a ""nice"" feedback on their website though. One positive thing about this experience, they promptly called me the next day following up on my feedback left on their website. The manager offered and apology and a gift card. Customer just want to feel like you appreciate their business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=320,3.68,3.5,3.5,3.1480000000000006,3.5720000000000005

360,Rosalinda F.,"Berwyn, IL",0,26,,3.0,2012-02-22,"Cheesecake Factory seems to have something on their menu that someone will like and if you go with a group, it seems that most people will enjoy it. All of my 6 co-workers really liked it. I have not been to the other locations, but I have been told that this Oak Brook location is big compared to the others. For my taste, I thought the food was only okay. I went with my family and we ordered and tried a little bit of each others food. Food - The warm crab and artichoke dip was very good. I ordered the Big Bang Shrimp and Chicken. For me it was not spicy enough and a little bit on the sweet side. The portabella burger was not that special, although I did like the sweet potato fries. The Spicy Beef was okay, but I did not think it all that different from something you could get at a regular Chinese restaurant. Desserts- Well the desserts were indeed good, but I think they lack a balance. For example, I ordered the Lemoncello torte and it did have a strong lemon flavor, but it overpowered the mascarpone cheese it had in it. No balance in the flavors, although it was good. The Godiva Chocolate cheescake was indeed very strong in flavor, but again I though the chocolate overpowered the ""cheescake"" flavor and so it was just a pure chocolate flavor and no ""cheesecake"" flavor. It was very creamy though. I did not try the tiramisu, but heard it was good. I think the portions are big, but it's embarrassing to admit that my family is able to finish all the food on his/her plate. Although we took our desserts to go because we were full.  Prices - seem a little high for food that was not bad, but not overly spectacular either. Still, I may go again and like I said, it seems most other people I know love this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=340,3.64,3.52,3.52,3.1160000000000005,3.5680000000000005

386,Dan P.,"La Grange Park, IL",14,58,23.0,3.0,2012-03-27,"Food is always good, as well as the atmosphere.  Only negatives I have for the place is the service and the lack of reservation system or call-ahead service.  I'm not being picky, with at least a reservation service, it will cut down on the wait times for customers (a lot of people leave after hearing the wait time, the maximum I've heard was 2 1/2 hours).  And the 2nd note, when you have A LOT of waiters/waitresses, you'd expect better faster service than your typical restaurant, but no.  As I said, I love the food, drinks, and especially the cheesecake here, just wanted to give a honest review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=400,3.52,3.49,3.49,3.308,3.5020000000000002

470,T C.,"Evergreen Park, IL",0,1,,2.0,2012-04-18,Came here with the family a week ago.had high expectations but was disappointed. I ordered the Spaghetti (tasted like it cam right out of a can). My lemonade was crazy sweet as if it needed additional sugar on the rim of the cup.Not going back.sorry,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=440,3.48,3.5,3.5,3.1760000000000006,3.4920000000000004
327,Katherine B.,"Downers Grove, IL",30,140,107.0,3.0,2012-04-25,"This place was pretty good but it wasn't good enough to wait an hour and a half for even if we could find a parking spot. We skipped the insane crowd on a Saturday evening and went for an early sunday lunch (which didn't have a wait surprisingly).  The seats that they seated my boyfriend and I at were so close together. I could rub elbows with the people at the seat next to me if we tried and the conversation of the  two girls next to us was so depressing. I could hear everything about each of their friends that had passed away. I'm sorry that it happened and I mean no disrespect to them but I felt so bleh after trying to ignore their conversation.  On the other hand our waitress was really pleasant and the food was pretty good. We had ordered the calamari for an appetizer and it was good. I ordered the grilled fish tacos which were also good. My boyfriend got the Cali cheese steak and he said it was good. The food was just good. Nothing spectacular. The cheesecake though was really good but was pretty expensive. I think it was $7 a slice.  The decoration was really nice, the feel of the place was relaxing, the bar was overly stocked and the menu is huge.  Over all everything was pretty good but I would recommend going on a weekday or a morning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=320,3.44,3.5,3.5,3.372,3.4760000000000004

As a result, my sisters had to go and put our name in at 6:30. The wait was 1 hour and 45 minutes. I picked up my mom at her house at 8 pm, and as soon as we arrived we were seated. It was great for my Mom and I, but my poor sisters had to wait the full hour and 45 minutes!!  Luckily, we were not in any kind of rush. Our server was so overwhelmed with tables. We were told it was their second busiest night of the year. It took 20 minutes to get our soda's and waters. When our food came out, they forgot our order of sweet potato fries. The server told us they would not be on our bill (since they finally came out when we were boxing up our food).  When we got the bill, not only were the sweet potato fries on it, but so was the $3 diet coke that my sister paid for when she got a drink at the bar during her nearly 2 hour wait. We had to explain to the server that the bar tender made it clear that her drink would have free refills once she go to the table. Our server apologized and took off the drink, fries, and our dessert. As he should have!!! We were at our table for full two hours. It was definitely a slow dinner, but luckily we did not mind since we did not have to be anywhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=300,3.44,3.48,3.48,3.404,3.4640000000000004
318,Vishal B.,"Lombard, IL",96,289,135.0,4.0,2012-05-19,"Yes.. you will have to wait to be seated, sometimes for an hour or more.. so plan accordingly because its a popular place that has the beeper system, no reservations! They offer valet parking which is nice for a special evening, then again, its loud inside as their seating capacity is upwards of 400.. ( i think).. For first timers... that giant book is not the next Twilight installment, its the menu.. I found it odd they have advertisements in there but so what, they have everything from Italian, Mexican, Asian, etc.. all with a ""everyone will like it"" American way about it. Ive had quesadillas, the burrito which is the size of a forearm, Evelyns favorite pasta, whoever she is.. got it right. Pizzas are also good, lettuce wraps, the eggplant sandwich, different appetizers including these fried cheese balls which were freakin amazing! As you can see, the bigger the group you go with, the more variety you will get to sample as the menu is huge, Ive never been for breakfast/brunch but seen that omelet menu and need to wake people up early enough to come here on a Sunday for brunch!  Entree portions can be large, so share along with conversation, take your time, and I cant stress enough how important it is to save room for Cheesecake, as if the name didn't tip you off. Red Velvet Cheesecake is their understated best hands down, the tiramisu cheesecake, dulce de leche, original with strawberry, or even the unique reeses peanut butter cheesecake...or the rich Godiva cheesecake.. with a latte or cappuccino.. They have a special Take out section just for picking up cheesecake on the way home from work... if you're avoiding the wait, and the noise.

352,AllAround C.,"Forest Park, IL",0,78,,2.0,2012-06-04,"My nephew graduated from high school and wanted to come here with family to celebrate. My sister called ahead of time, (problem #1) they DO NOT take weekend reservations. (WHAT? that's when you should take reservations) I arrived before everyone else in our party of 8. I told them 8-10 people, but definitely 8. They told me 30-40 minutes. (Problem #2) An hour and 10 minutes later we are still waiting. Oh Oh, my more outspoken family members are up demanding a table now. (a lot people came in after my party and was seated, they could have put 3 tables together to accommodate our party, which they eventually did) We finally sat down and received 3 free appetizers. (Problem#3) When the check arrived, the appetizers were on the check. (Problem#4) Several members of our family went to the counter to purchase slices of cheesecake ""to go"", the line was ridiculous and the were giving the orders out randomly. The person behind me received his 2 slices before my 1. I was disgusted. The food was good and cheesecake delicious, but service was horrible. It wasn't the waiter, he was wonderful. It was the hostess and the desert counter. Just chaos in the front. It makes me wonder how the kitchen is organized.

343,Johnny O.,"La Grange, IL",0,6,,2.0,2012-06-05,"Denny's quality food meets Vegas casino lobby decor... The wait was too long at Wildfire so my wife and I went here with a giftcard we'd been hanging on to for a while. The wait was not too bad for a Friday about 5:30p but the place was packed by the time we left. The hostess asked if an indoor table was okay, we said it was, and then she promptly seated us outside.  At least it was a nice night and the view of the traffic in the parking lot was wonderful. We split a chopped salad.  It was ok - there was not as much bacon as I would have liked. I had the Cuban sandwich.  The pork was dry and it was just not very good.  The fries were excellent.   My wife had a chicken and pasta dish.  She said it was gross and ate about a 1/4 of it.  The sauce was orange and looked suspiciously like it came directly from a can of Spaghettios. The server could have been more attentive with our drinks. Bottom line: 1. This is a great place for a gangbanger to bring his girlfriend for a ""nice"" dinner.   2.

My table got avocado spring rolls as an appetizer, and it was very yummy! (I think I found a mock-recipe on Pintrest, must try!)  My boyfriend got the Thai chicken pasta and I got the fish tacos.  Both were good-tasting, but for reference I would compare it to food you could get at Chili's or Applebees.  The others at our table ordered the garlic noodles and the eggplant sandwich... I'm not sure what they thought but everyone ended up cleaning their plate or bringing home leftovers so I have a feeling it was all pretty tasty! Of course, we got cheesecake for dessert, and the b-friend and I shared the mango key lime flavor.  Deeeeelish-- it was easily my favorite part of the meal.  It was light (as light as cheesecake gets, that is) and the fruity touch was a nice way to end our night.   Oh yeah, but we went there on a Saturday night and the wait area was packed.  Luckily we only had to stand around for 20 minutes or so, but if you are in a rush I would try somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=280,3.4,3.46,3.46,3.532,3.4360000000000004

Big menu (I LOVE the skinny menu they have now!), huge portions, and great desserts and drinks. They are pricey - especially their drinks. I don't like how they don't put the price on the menu for their drinks. That's deceiving.  But the atmosphere is nice, our server was nice, and you get a lot for your money. We didn't have to wait that long which was shocking for a Saturday night dinner. You also want to park in the parking garage next door - the parking lots are a nightmare.

192,Yvonne B.,"Chicago, IL",384,866,1948.0,2.0,2012-06-29,"When I was a small, going to McDonald's was a treat. Now it makes me feel sick. Then, when I was in my early 20s and didn't know better, TGI Friday's was my FAVORITE restaurant. At that time, going to the Cheesecake Factory was a big ooh la la deal. I considered the Cheesecake Factory to be high class fancy. Not so much anymore. Now I just think it's overrated. The super high ceilings, murals, and lighting are reminiscent of a banquet hall or ballroom; however, that's in stark contrast to their booths and regular tables. The servers do their jobs. Nothing more and nothing less. It's not exceptional. At one point I wandered around looking for a bathroom and it took several employees passing me by before one kind soul gave me any kind of direction. The food is okay, although I only got dessert during my most recent visit. My buddy got cheesecake (which he loved!) and I got a Tres Leches Milk Shake. The milk shake was super caramel-y and super sticky sweet for my taste. It was also so huge that I hardly devoured a quarter of it before I brought it to my fridge at home. I might visit The Cheesecake Factory at the Oak Brook Mall if I happen to be there for something else (e.g. shopping); however, I don't think I would seek it out just because. I mean, heck - there's even better restaurants at the mall. I might only head over to the Cheesecake Factory if I want dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=200,3.36,3.45,3.45,3.4640000000000004,3.414

That is exactly what the Cheesecake Factory offers with their half-price appetizers everyday during Happy Hour from 4 - 6 pm.  Thankfully, the Cheesecake Factory has not succumbed to pulling the Happy Hour Bait & Switch routine like many restaurants in the area which only provide a limited selection of small portioned foods or watered-down drinks during their Happy Hour.  The Cheesecake Factory offers the full portion of their appetizers for half price. The only downside is that you have to sit in the bar area and sometimes seating is limited.

After being seated we ordered drinks and dinner. Although busy, our wait times were again about 15minutes, which I consider good. The S.O. had a burger, it was slightly overcooked and the bun was mundane, but he said it was ok. I had the corn tamale cakes, which I think hands down are the best thing on their menu. They were just as I remembered, tasty, just the right portion for dinner, and hot, but not too spicy.  When it was time for coffee and dessert, S.O. ordered a raspberry white chocolate cheesecake. He loved that. Now for the bad parts...he ordered a drink, it came in a cracked, chipped glass. While they replaced it, they didn't offer to take it off the tab. Sorry, I work in the business and I know the first rule...broken chipped glass...free drink! I was drinking ice tea during dinner, one glass mind you. As it was kind of cold I wanted hot tea.

The restaurant was incredibly loud. The music was pounding. We could barely hear each other talk. Add a screaming baby and you have bedlam. Our waiter had a plastered on smile that never moved. However his eyes never actually looked at us. He kept scanning the restaurant for who knows what. The waiter lined us up with two glasses of water each. This was our first sign that he did  not intend on coming back very often. We ordered appetizers: grilled artichoke, calamari, corn cakes. The artichoke was good, the corn cakes were excellent and the calamari was sub-standard, I ordered the Moroccan chicken. It was good but not exceptional. My friends said their food was ok, but not really remarkable. We finally were able to flag down the waiter to order deserts. One of our party asked if there was a cheese cake sampler. The waiter replied ""That would defeat the purpose."" I have no idea what that meant. We ordered two desserts and requested five plates and forks so we could split the deserts. The waiter returned with three forks. No plates. No forks for the other two people in our party. We asked again for the plates and two more forks. We never saw him again until he delivered the bill.

I am a picky eater and sometimes have difficulty finding items on a menu.  The menu here is HUGE  over 16 pages.  It has a large variety from which to choose.  I had no trouble finding many items that I could eat. The food was good.  We heard no complaints about quality and a few complaints about quantity.  Portion sizes were large.  My wife and I ordered the Kobe burger with salad on the side and onion rings.  The rings were good and abundant.  One order would have been enough for both my wife and I.  Of course the taste of those rings made it impossible to leave any remaining on the table.  A few were given away; the rest devoured.  The Kobe burger was large and good and correctly cooked to order. I arrived before my wife and her coworkers and had a beer in the bar.  The bartender was friendly, service was quick.  We chatted a bit as is common with all good bartenders.  Later when my wife and one of her coworkers arrived, the bartender congratulated my wife's retirement.  Remembering little things is good business.  Table service was good too.  Ordering, food delivery, processing multiple individual checks was handled well by friendly and attentive staff. The decor is attractive and the place is loud, but not so loud that you couldn't hear a conversation several seats away from you at the table. Oh yeah...the cheesecake.   I don't eat any, but my wife is eating one now as I write this.  She took her cheesecake home for dinner.  Others ate theirs entirely or split the cheesecake - half for eating/half to take home.  They are are big cheesecakes.

They serve a myriad of classic meals without any innovative twists and serve any kind of cheesecake you could imagine.     Why the 2 stars?     Holy hell bad service! We celebrated two of my friends birthdays, filling up three of the big booths in the back of the restaurant. We had a large group. Our server waited on two of the booths. On multiple occasions during our meal, the server seemed clueless, overwhelmed, and just no where to be seen. And it is at times such as these, where an automatic 18% tip is added that really gets my goat. Upon the main dishes being served to my booth of 7, my friend was left empty handed. So we all sat and waited, expecting her burger to be following close behind. 2 minutes passed. 5 more. 15 minutes! No waiter. No food. WTH? Finally her burger arrived brought by a wait staff not our own. No apologies offered. Two of my friends needed a to go box for their slices of cheesecake. Where is said waiter? MIA.

175,Angela P.,"Aurora, IL",440,1743,13.0,2.0,2013-02-13,"My last review stated that the golden rule of Cheesecake Factory was to avoid, avoid, AVOID on Fridays and Saturdays. My rule has changed:  Avoid Cheesecake Factory (Oak Brook) altogether. My friend and I met here for a gluttonous Fat Tuesday meal.  I had the macaroni and cheese burger, followed by a slice of raspberry lemon cheesecake.  I felt like I had a brick in my stomach all the way through to the next morning!  I'm not complaining, though, Cheesecake Factory really is one of America's best and holds up the stereotype that we eat way too much.  But the food is good.   The menu is all over the place, so they don't really have a speciality.  Order what intrigues you or your guilty pleasure - you'll like it. So why the 2 stars?  The service here is HORRIBLE!  Our waitress, Tasha, seemed normal at first.  She told us about the specials, and her favorite cheesecakes, and our drinks and food arrived without a problem.  The end of the meal is when it got strange.  She delivered our checks with 2 pens.  2 pens with Cooper's Hawk printed on them.  Huh? When she came back for our checks, she demanded to know where the second pen was.  I ignored her at first, since any sane person would glance around quickly and then walk away.  It is, after all, a pen.  A pen that belongs to another restaurant!  Instead, she stood there while I stared right back at her and said, ""I don't know.  I don't know where it is.""  She stood there while I looked under the table and my friend shuffled plates and napkins around.  No pen.  She continued to stand there.  Awkward.

I try not to be snobby, but I have high standards for food. My date was quick to remind me that it's The Cheesecake Factory, not ""The Food Factory."" Noted. We were starving so we got the fried cheese off of the ""small plates"" menu. Mozzarella sticks, essentially. They were good though. In fact, they were probably better than my entree. I got the fish and chips. True to Cheesecake Factory lore, the portion was massive. The fish was decent, but the breading was a little thick and doughy. It was served with a fist-sized portion of coleslaw and tartar sauce. Provided the breading wasn't too thick, a piece of fish with tartar sauce and a forkfull of coleslaw made for a pretty good bite. My girlfriend got the shrimp and bacon sandwich. It was giant. Triple decker. Lots of lettuce. The shrimp were grilled, and unfortunately they were insanely overcooked. The sandwich had good flavor though. Anyways, one comes to the Cheesecake Factory for the cheesecake, right? So we got some. She got the new Oreo one, and I got raspberry chocolate truffle. Hers was total overkill, but delicious. Mine was a little more traditional, and excellent. I'd definitely go back for cheesecake, but I don't know about this place becoming a staple in my list of go-to restaurants.  Notes: The place is MASSIVE, yet at 4PM on a Sunday it was still a 15-20 minute wait for the two of us. Also, I'd estimate that 85% of the massive menu is deep-fried.

Our waitress was attentive, and kept our glasses full for the majority of the meal. It took us a long time to choose our orders because we were catching up, and the menu is like 30 pages long... Seriously who needs that many options?  Anyway I had a couple tall Honker's Ales as they were on tap. I ate the Chicken and Biscuit meal. The biscuit and gravy was excellent while the chicken was so-so. The mixed veggies and mashed potatoes served with it were also pretty good. It was the 1st time I have ever finished a meal at the CF without feeling like I was going to explode.  My wife ordered a side caeser salad (love their dressing), and a lunch portion of a sundried tomato and chicken pasta. When her pasta was delivered, it was covered in a cream sauce which was not mentioned anywhere on the menu (interesting as they have plenty of space for that kind of detail). She requested they make her a new one without cream sauce as she is what I lovingly refer to as a lactard (lactose intolerant). The waitress that dropped off the pasta said something along the lines of ""well it always comes with cream sauce on it."" Which I thought was pretty rude, but I let it slide. Our actual waitress came over, apolgized for the mixup and took the pasta to have it remade as requested. The manager also stopped at our table to apologize and offer to bring my wife a complimentary soup which we politely declined. When the bill came they did remove the pasta from the bill which was appreciated. The other couple we met ordered the buffalo burger (burger with fried onion straws, bleu cheese, and buffalo sauce) and the chicken avocado club. Both looked delicious.  Overall, the experience was pleasant. The good thing about cheesecake factory is you seem to always get exactly what you would expect. A menu with way too many options to choose from, giant portions that you shouldn't finish (but probably will), average to slighlty above average service, average food, and outrageous cheesecake (if you had the will power to not eat your entire meal).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=240,3.76,3.59,3.59,3.2760000000000007,3.658

285,Dan T.,"Chicago Ridge, IL",18,30,,2.0,2013-10-13,"My party of four arrived at the Cheesecake Factory about 6:50pm on a Saturday. We were told that the wait would be 50 minutes, so we decided to hang around, and were seated within that time window.  The ambience of this location is interesting. It's reminiscent of an Italian cathedral with high ceilings, buttresses, and sconces on the walls. Our table was in the corner of the restaurant, in a large circular area that provided a nice intimate feeling.  The waiter was quite attentive. We ordered Chicken Madeira, Chicken And Biscuits, Chicken Carbonara, and Chicken and Shrimp Jambalaya over Fettucine. I was a bit surprised that dinner didn't include a soup or salad option. Our meals arrived in a timely manner - or at least most of them did. Three of the dishes were brought out by the runner. We waited about 5 minutes, then I found our waiter and informed him that one of our party was still waiting for their plate. The FOH manager came by and I informed him of the missing dish. He disappeared for a few moments and brought back the missing entrée - all without an explanation or apology.  A few minutes later the waiter came back and explained that this particular runner had forgotten dishes at least twice that evening. The waiter said that he had informed the kitchen manager of the problem as well. The rest of the meal was uneventful, and the dishes were very tasty (although my son, who had the Chicken and Biscuits, became violently ill that night). I realize that sometimes there are issues - however, a simple apology from the manager would have gone a long toward a higher rating.

I was very impressed..our waitress said they had a meeting about gluten free food and how to avoid cross contamination..for someone with very bad food allergies it's heavenly to hear that.

But I will give them some credit: they actually do make everything fresh, and regularly change up their large menu with seasonal items. Here's what I liked: No wait around 5:30 on a Friday (though there certainly was one when we left) Service was solid Food was really good, actually We got nachos as an appetizer; they had tasty pulled chicken, good amounts of cheese, fresh guacamole and pico de gallo, and were nice and hot. For my dinner I got two items from the small plates -- a sausage and ricotta flatbread and an arugula salad, lightly dressed with lemon, olive oil, parmesan, marcona almonds and golden raisins. The flatbread was deliciously garlicky (a little skimpy on the sausage but oh well) and the crust was airy and chewy-crisp. The salad was well-dressed and just the right size. My husband got a chipotle chicken sandwich and seemed to enjoy it.  Not all of the portions are huge, I'd like to add -- they do have a nice variety of more reasonable sized plates. That said I did see one of the biggest burritos in existence, about a foot long and at least four inches wide.  What's not to like? Well, the building has huge ceilings and the tables are close together so it's very echoey and kind of loud.  And there is the argument that if you have a menu spanning sushi rolls to pasta dishes to Tex-Mex you may not be doing any of it well -- I can't speak for the entire menu, but I can say that what we ate was good. That said the prices are a couple bucks higher than I'd like for the quality and atmosphere.

They have a lite menu for our calorie counters. But remember all their portion sizes are huge- for two people. So no matter how hungry you are, just split. They have happy hour and small plate deals in the bar on weekdays.  They obviously have a million cheesecakes. My goal is to try them all. I've had the caramel, raspberry, and regular- all delicious. Regular tiramisu is better than the cheesecake version. My favorite dishes are Thai lettuce wraps, baked artichokes, and BBQ ranch salad.

Can you go a bit slower?  #3: (apparently gives up, because asking her to be understandable is too much): Your total will be ($) and it will be ready in 15 minutes. Me: Um, I'd still like to know what kind of dressings there are please. #3: (FINALLY slows down enough for me to catch a few words, from which I can figure out my options). Me: ok I'll take the vinaigrette please. #3: It'll be ready in 20 minutes. *click* I get there (I love how after picking my dressing the time I had to wait magically went up by 5 minutes) and they forgot the bread (when I pointed this out they actually looked in my bag to make sure I wasn't lying before giving it to me.)

The savory menu is vast and varied: fish, fowl, burgers, pizza, pasta, eggs, sandwiches, salads, steaks & chops, comfort food,  Asian-inspired, Tex-Mex, fried stuff with cheese. It's All-American and wrapped up in an eye-popping, technicolor, Egypt meets theme park package. And then there's cheesecake. Lots and lots of cheesecake. Cheesecake-On-Ice. There are, at minimum, two dozen types of cheesecake from plain to fruity to decadent chocolate. Ever wonder what is meant by the phrase gilding the lily? The answer is: The Cheesecake Factory cheesecake. Whipped cream is not enough for these people! They must stuff it with candy, or maybe stir in booze, or sprinkle it with chips or streusel, or top it with frosting. They layer it with cake, or brownies, or fresh fruit. If you're a person who, when it comes to desserts, believes more is more; then The Cheesecake Factory is for you! The sweets don't stop with cheesecake either. Oh heavens no! There are ice cream sundaes, cakes, tortes, milkshakes, and tiramisu. Now I know I just called this place a crowd-pleaser, but that does not mean it tops my personal list of restaurants. Although the food is good and I've never had any dish here to complain about, it isn't great. The Cheesecake Factory's strength is variety. You can please the kids, the grandparents, and the vegetarians all in one place. For me, the entire concept from decor to menu is over-the-top. Sensory overload. Too many menu items. Too many embellishments. Too much noise. Too many people. Too many tables too close together. Too many smells. No, seriously! Try enjoying your cheesecake on a not-exactly-clean table only a foot away from neighboring tables eating fish and pasta. It's too much for me. I'm much more likely to drop by for a slice of cheesecake to take home.

Again, took forever to get out. It's a huge restaurant so I understand if the kitchen gets a little backed up-but it was backed up on every aspect of our meal! No manager came around to apologize (something that is crucial in my place of employment when time standards are not met). I suppose it's just a different type of service! The food was ok. I got the beet salad which I thought would be bigger but I'm watching my weight anyway so I was ok with it. The only item that didn't take long was the swiping of our credit card!

Sure, the cheesecake is great, however, the staff is rude and unfriendly.

This was fine until we could hear the rude remarks the wait staff was making about other customers, and then later we heard them complaining about our party. After we had asked to speak to the manager, we were treated worse, and the manager did not even give a care and simply wrote off a single entree and gave a meaningless apology. During the dinner, I had gone to use the restroom and found that only one stall was clean; the other had someone's period and tampon on the ground and around the seat. I immediately told the two hostess's and explained how awful it is and how it needs to be cleaned up and that the toilet paper also needed to be restocked. First, they were rude because I had interrupted their personal conversation, and second, they barley took attention to my complaint and then waved me off. I understand how working in food service is, and how stressful it can be. However, this is incredibly unacceptable.

Food comes and my son's order is wrong--somehow they mistake pizza for Mac and cheese; Madeira good as always. They say they will get pizza. 15 mins later we ask another server to get us bread and check on our pizza because we have not seen our server. Oops-- they never put the pizza order in. Our server finds out and apologizes and says it will be right away-first order in kitchen and promises us they will cover meal and a couple pieces of cheesecake. Meanwhile she disappears again and I go up to bar to get refills for water and Cokes for our table on several occasions--not the most pleasant group there but fine.  Another 15 minutes--no pizza and more self service on the drinks. I lost it and went to look for a manager. He ends up getting us a different waiter Brandon B who was very nice--but the damage was done. Then the 'manager' actually has the gall to reduce the comp for the bad service; he takes off the small pizza and 1 slice of cheesecake that we had to get 'to go' because it was now late and we had been done with our food for 30 minutes.  I get it--some people probably complain and take advantage of you--but that wasn't me so you need to figure out a different way to identify abusers.  That comp for that bad of service was weak--frankly you should have paid me tonight--that's how bad it was.  To put it simply--Your service sucked tonight!  I hope to finish off my gift cards from this place at another location but frankly nothing is real convenient from Wheaton.

After being seated, we order drinks - Sangria for my wife, Long Island Iced Tea for me and strawberry lemonade for my son.  My drink was awful! It tasted like 15 sour lemons squeezed into a glass with a splash of brown liquid.  Undrinkable! Asked for manager, and was presented with Christopher Johannsen, who said he was sorry I didn't like it. It was it that I didn't like it - it was that it was the most horrible cocktail I have ever had the misfortune to sip!  I asked for a Diet Coke instead. Dinner comes.  My wife's skinny steak is fine - my skinny enchiladas look good as well.  However, no cheese pizza for the son.  Christopher comes out - again - to let me know it will be 5 minutes.  We decide to eat as my son doesn't care if we do, and after my second piece of ""chicken tooth"" (or gristle - whatever you want to call it) - I was done.  Set the plate aside and explained to waitress that two bits of enchilada spit out pretty much soured me on the whole experience. Pizza finally comes.  I ask to speak to the manager again, and I suggest that as pizza was late, my food and drink were nauseating, and our whole evening and experience was a disaster, that Christopher not bring me any bill whatsoever.  Christopher, in his infinite manager wisdom, would have none of that and offered to comp my drink, my dinner, and the pizza, but not the entire thing.  We discussed this back and forth and I made it clear I would not expect to be paying ANYTHING but ol' Christ would not hear of it.   I explained this to the waitress and asked if there was a ""real"" manager I could speak to.  Eventually some other older guy came over, and with no attempt at an apology, or even a fake act to show that he was at least concerned about our experience, told us to go ahead and not pay and just leave.  So we did. What a disaster!  It's obvious that the Cheesecake Factory is so large that they don't care about a customer here or there, so that is why I was so surprised how hard it was to get them to comp our lousy meal.     I hope everybody reads this and forwards to the awful management staff at that restaurant but I doubt they would care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=260,2.8,3.5,3.5,2.7880000000000003,3.22

Took our orders great!  Food come out in another 20 or so minutes.  My food is ok... tomatoes are a bit mushy.  I got the Chicken Avocado Club... my friend got Orange chicken.  His was so badly cooked he couldn't eat it and sent it back.  I believe the rice and flavors were somewhat burnt tasting and was not tasting normal, and he's had this dish many many times.  So another 10 minutes before we could find someone to take it back.  Few more minutes to come ask take another order.  Instead of lunch he settled for cheesecake.  She came back with the check and left it there.  I admit we talked for at least another hour or so but, she never came by for at least an hour and half to even check on us.  Maybe filled our waters twice during our entire meal.  I have no idea why it was so hard to get any service at such a restaurant with many servers.  It was as if she either didn't care much or just didn't want to show her face.  I don't know whatever her reason was, but it was unacceptable.  Usually, I'd call over a manager right away, but seeing how bad service was, I was afraid the manager wouldn't manage as well either.  So instead, sadly, being a past server and manager myself, I never do this but I did not leave much tip.  I won't say how much but just simply wrote, ""Thank you for the bad service,"" on the receipt and left.   Maybe a manager will see this and hopefully they will manage a bit better or check on their guests a bit more?  With so many employees, why was it so hard to do their jobs?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=240,2.84,3.47,3.47,2.8520000000000003,3.218

The fish was very light and no fishy taste at all. The black beans and rice had a weird flavor. I would have rather had it plain white rice and beans.  The dessert is what's it's all about. Can't go wrong with any of the choices. I personally like the chocolate mouse because it's a lighter cheesecake for after dinner.  The one thing I like best is that they give you large portions.

This is not to say that the latter are always hits and the former duds. No...there must be something to (most) corporate/chain places that made them such a success in the first place. Cheesy Factory, that's what I call it, has a winning formula. They're huge, the cheesecake is actually really good, their usually pretty slick and professional with reservations, seating, service, etc. And the food is actually pretty dayum good. And we're talking a, what? 15 page menu here? How do they do it. My guest told me their kitchen has a zillion staff and it's a little nuts in there. I believe it. How they can keep all those ingredients fresh or make sense of a lunch rush of tickets coming I don't know but they do. I had a lunch miso salmon over brown rice with spring peas. It was cooked perfectly and very succulent with - let's use the word - umami. My pineapple Moscow mule was excellent if a bit sweet. Guest tends to get the build your own Asian lettuce wraps and she built me one and it was delicioso. The presentation on that one is really phenom too. I mean this place even plates stuff upscale.

With that being said, it was a night I did not want to cook and forced my boyfriend to go to cheesecake factory with me. Of course he agreed. Cheesecake factory is usually pretty busy, which I hope, the majority of people would understand. So yes, I had to wait. Yes, the food took a little bit of time, but that's what you're supposed to expect on a weekend night. So it didn't bother me at all. When I got to my table, I was greeted with a friendly server. He recommended some great food items. At the very end of it, I asked my server to come up with some mystery shots for me and my boyfriend, and I still have NO idea what I had to drink, I drank 2 glasses of merlot before I had that shot, and I am not a heavy drinker. He came back with the shots and I asked him for the dessert menu! The whole purpose of my visit was for the cheesecake. And yes, I saved room for it.

No matter what, if you are visiting on the weekend for dinner expect obscene wait times. I'm talking 60-90 minutes. The place is huge and they do their best for quick turnover, but the wait is unavoidable. There is the option to dine outside, but despite the offer from the hostess, it was just too chilly for that.       I suggest you head to the bar during your wait. To the bartender with the full tattoo sleeves-you rock and you made the rest of the evening tolerable. My martini was delicious and the sample of that ice cream concoction was awesome! You made sure we had everything we wanted and you made the wait time fly by.      Unfortunately, that was the only highlight of the evening. Our server, although nice, seemed as if she was having an off night. The table next to us that she was serving received the wrong food-she admitted to ringing it up wrong. They were pretty cool with it. She was pretty hard to get a hold of throughout the night as well.       I ordered the jambalaya pasta and my husband ordered the bacon burger. We also started off with Cuban egg rolls as an appetizer. The appetizer was delicious and I was excited for the main course. I received my pasta-the presentation was perfect. And then I started to dig around my dish with my fork. My pasta was pretty much still curled up in spirals and there was no sauce. That's right. No sauce added at all. This dish has a cream Cajun sauce that makes it-tonight there was none to be found. My husband's burger was a bit overcooked and the bacon was extra charred, but he dealt with it and just ate it. The fries also tasted kinda stale to me.     I alerted the waitress about my pasta with no sauce and she offered to bring out sauce or take it back. We had already been waiting quite a while so I just asked for the sauce. Time goes by. I see my waitress come back with no sauce. Apparently it would have to take another 5 minutes on top of the time I had already waited to make some sauce for me. When the sauce finally arrived it just looked like stewed tomatoes in a bowl. No cream sauce to be found. I just took the tepid runny sauce and poured it myself over the pasta-it made the pasta a bit more edible.       Sigh. I usually have quite good experiences at this Cheesecake Factory, but this time I was only left with a disappointing feeling and leftovers that I really didn't want.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=120,3.16,3.27,3.456,2.7960000000000003,3.226

The wait wasn't long at all. For a party 3 on a Sunday afternoon, it was only 20 minutes. What was interesting was while we were waiting, a man walked in with one flip flop on and a bare foot. Yes Ii said it, bare foot. No shoe or sock, just toes. He walked right up to the counter passed the 20 or so people who were waiting to be seated and requested a table. Then he took the buzzer and walked out. Our table was ready before his so I wasn't able to see if he ever put a shoe on or not. I thought that was disgusting and the guy should have been turned away until he had both shoes. Eww! Other than that, the food was delicious. I ordered the Jamaican shrimp and chicken, which was very tasty. It was seasoned like it was straight from Kingston. Yummy. The curry wasn't overpowering either, because I'm not a curry fan. Overall, I'd go back but management need to be more aware of their customers attire. No shirt, no shoes, no service. I never understood the purpose of that statement in a store until yesterday.

After self-parking our car and walking in to the restaurant, we were greeted politely by the Valet Parker, even though we did not want to pay him $4 to park our car.  The hostess and the manager greeted us and sat us at our table in less than 2 minutes, but then again, we came at around 5:15 pm - a great time to avoid the dinner crowd, which normally comes after 6:00 pm on a Friday night. When our waitress came over to greet us and got our drink and appetizer orders, she quickly returned with the drinks and later, the Thai Lettuce Wraps - SUPER YUMMY!  From there, everything went down hill fast in terms of service.  Like most people, we made a mess eating our appetizers because the lettuce was dripping with sauces on the table - talk about finger ""licking"" good!  After she took away our appetizers, she didn't even bother to clean the table - which was clearly messy and visible by everyone.  How can you not see the sauce all over the table and not even wipe it down????? We all decided to wait and see what she would do next, and sure enough, she came back with our dinner plates and served them on top of the messy table without blinking an eye - UNBELIEVABLE!!!!  Then she cleared the table of dirty dishes and still didn't even clean the ""new mess"" on top of the ""old mess.""  After all that said, we ordered dessert and waited for her to bring out our cheesecakes, and you guess it, she served them on the dirty table - WOW!!!! Given the price point for this restaurant, you would expect better trained waiters / waitresses, but I guess management did not care.  To be honest, I've had much better services from ""fast-casual"" restaurants then here.  The bottom line, I would recommend The Cheesecake Factory for their atmosphere and food quality, but good ""Customer Service"" needs improvement quickly!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=100,3.12,3.1,3.396,2.508,3.1080000000000005

The meal was hearty and taste good overall. By the time I'd finished my entree I was full and could only order a slice of strawberry cheesecake to go.

We had to go back and remind them we still waiting two more times before we were finally seated at 9:30.  What really burns me is that I am convinced we were never on the waiting list to begin with, instead of just admitting they had made a mistake, and seating us as soon as possible they acted like we were being unreasonable.  When we were finally shown to a table, the lobby was empty and a couple that had just come in was seated before us!

We went in and waited about 30 minutes not big deal it was Saturday afternoon and the wait was not bad. We were given a nice table and waited quite awhile for our server but they were busy so that part was okay and she was really nice. Now for the food. It just was awful. I was so looking forward to trying the mac/burger since it was my first time at this place. I ordered it medium with no salt on the fries. It came out like a brick and the fries had so much salt I sent it back. Than when it came out again it was RAW I mean not even medium rare but raw so I couldn't eat is and by that time I was done. My friend had a veggie burger and she hated it very mushy but she didn't say anything. My other friend had a chicken buffalo sandwich they brought the wrong sauce (blue cheese) and when she said something they just brought out new sauce but by then the sandwich was ruined and she didn't eat her either. My other friend got a salad and sweet potato fries and said the salad was just okay but the fries were full of grease. The manager did come over and take 2 items off the check but it wasn't enough we should not have been charged for anything other than the drinks. Just bad customer service as far as I am concerned. Even with 2 meals taken off it was still almost 75.00 without the tip.

We came here most recently on a Sunday evening after shopping at oakbrook. We really didn't think it was going to be as busy as it was, but there was a 30-45 minute wait! We luckily were able to find a seat at the bar and didn't have to wait.  The bartenders were all attentive, though it was a little confusing on who you were supposed to order from. Our bread got forgotten twice and we had to remind them, then it never even came in the end. They also brought out two of my salads, so not sure what happened there.

It's supplanted the Red Lobsters and Olive Gardens and Chilis and Applebee's of the world (arguably) and now represents a night out with your parents. For your consideration: EXHIBIT A That menu is massive. If you can't find something you like, then you clearly don't like eating out. Not that it's masterfully prepared, but just that it covers the gamut from pastas to salads to burgers and steaks and chops and pizza and every dang thing in between. It's sensory overload, and it's perfectly American. We love our variety. We love one of everything.  EXHIBIT B The portions are massive. So, I don't want to jump on the bandwagon about big Americans, but the numbers don't lie. Numbers notwithstanding, I have also noticed that when I travel abroad, the serving sizes are smaller. Paint it how you like--American excess or a culture that seeks out good value--but the portions are honkin' huge here.  EXHIBIT C Dessert. So much dessert. And again, our national colors are red, white, blue and sugar. And there's plenty of it. Pages of cheesecake. So much. And some of it (like the cookie dough one I tried) is so sugared and tricked out, you don't really know you're eating cheesecake. Do yourself a favor and stick with a simple kind.

Then to add insult to injury, my other daughter ordered spaghetti/meatballs.  Which was very good - large portion.  So of course she took leftovers home -probably more than half the serving.  The next day when she opened her package hoping to finish her meal before she ran off to work, - yuck!  they gave her someone else's leftovers.  It was pasta - but not the spaghetti she had... which can only mean another customer had a similar experience when they opened their leftovers.  It was not only frustrating, but kind of gross to think about it.  The prices are already just a bit high for what you get (in my opinion), but then to lose an entire serving of leftovers; enough to say - nope - next time we'll go to one of the other restaurants directly across the mall drive",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=260,3.04,2.96,3.28,2.536,2.9920000000000004

They also tend to be super busy, meaning the service is subpar.  I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, as it's usually raved about online. The chicken was super moist on the inside, and crispy on the outside. The pasta, however, was oily and the saucy didn't have any spice to it. There were also 5 slices of mushroom and two or three pepper chunks, which hardly qualifies as present in the dish. The serving was huge, and probably could have fed 3 people.  I also ordered the Kahlua cheesecake, which was amazing. I wasn't a fan of the brownie layer, but the coffee cheesecake and chocolate mousse were amazing.

Also, the refills were done without asking a few times which is always a plus!

There's also a horseradish sauce on the side that complements the dish amazingly. My entree was the mushroom burger and it was mediocre at best. The flavor was in line with a microwaveable burger for some reason. The meat didn't have any flavor to it, and the burger was just topped with mushrooms and onions. The mixture was surprisingly bland and heavy unfortunately. The Fontina cheese didn't really do anything for the burger because it's quite mild. Definitely not what I expected. I ordered the Kahlua cheesecake, which is has flavors similar to Tiramisu, however, the Tiramisu cheesecake here is far too sweet. The Kahlua is just the right amount of sweet, and creaminess in a dessert. It's light for a cheesecake, and has an accent of coffee to contrast the cake's richness.

My husband had the enchiladas it looked like a plate of slop covered heavily with cilantro. He said they were tasteless. My daughter ordered the chicken Madeira she said the chicken was rubbery, the mashed potatoes were cold and she mentioned the sauce was very salty.

Parking is available nearby with the connection to the mall, and there is valet parking as well should you need it. I know this place is renowned for its cheesecake, but since I don't like cheesecake, I cannot comment on that. The establishment itself looks like every other Cheesecake Factory, kind of like a modern-ish church feel with a bar thrown in there. Personally, I find it far too loud, but that's because it's busy because it surprises me - The food here is pretty much in my opinion like recooked leftovers, or if you want to bump it up just a tad, like gourmet airline food. I've been here nearly 5 or 6 times in the past few years and each time from the food to the service (or serious lack of) it gets progressively worse. The only thing I see as a perk here is the outdoor seating on nice weather, it's definitely a nice location. But that's about it. You are far better off trying perhaps Maggiano's across the street or even the Pour House. Definitely overcrowded, understaffed (at times), overcooked and definitely overrated.

Is it really our fault that every time we order something they mess it up? My family and I have been coming here for years, but the only time there's anything wrong with the order is when we get take out. The fact that this location can treat a regular customer so badly is just sad.

Unfortunately, I had no choice but to go here tonight JUST to get cheesecake. I wouldn't be able to drive a half hour away at 11 pm to another location--since this is the closest to me. But yet again, they managed to screw this order up too. It's pretty obvious it was deliberately done due to their immature and prejudice staff.

Waitresses are always pretty happy and welcoming even though they have a lot on their plate (hehe)  Speaking of plates, the portions here are pretty huge which compensates for the prices. Some things are kind of overpriced (like the mex fusion or Asian fusion stuff) but it's a treat for people that don't have a lot of authentic restaurant in the area. To start, the whole wheat bread is pretty good.. it gives a five star based on the theory of ""judge a restaurant by the free bread"".  The calamari is probably the best I've had. It's lightly breaded and I don't get the feeling that it's frozen. So good, I'd be deceived if the tartar sauce or cocktail sauce is homemade.  Entree wise, I usually get the chicken and shrimp gumbo cuz it's creamy, tomato-y, spicyish from the andouille sausage. Something I rarely find in the Midwest.  This place is the epitome of an American restaurant and I'm glad is a pretty solid chain restaurant.  I'm also not a cheesecake junky. I just come for the food. I bet the cheesecake is really good.

I'm a fan of al dente pasta, but it mine was simply undercooked and tough. No problem, when our waiter, Stephen, passed by I let him know and he said he'd bring more.  In the meantime I was enjoying my eggplant medallions. Alas the last two were also undercooked - eggplant is good firm, but it shouldn't have any crunch to it! Because we wanted to head out, I didn't bother mentioning this to Stephen and just finished it up along with the fresh pasta (which was cooked properly although still way too oily.)

There's a reason why this restaurant, at every location, is always packed.  I have to keep my sodium intake low, which is impossible when you eat out. Having said that, here they've always accommodated my request to refrain from adding salt, and they've always done it with a smile. Nut allergies? No problem. They'll take all precautions necessary to ensure your dish is safe.  You'll have to set your budget a little higher here, especially if you plan on ordering one of their famous deserts ($7-8) but it will be worth it.  Points: -If you order a kids meal with fries, ask for no salt on the fries and add it yourself if needed.  -The tuna tataki salad is amazing, ask for the dressing on the side.  -Like carbonara? Substitute shrimp for chicken, you won't regret it! -I'm not one for skinny dishes but try their skinny chicken pot pie, it's not lacking anything and is a healthier choice than most.  -The banana cream cheesecake is my number one choice, super light with a fluffy/creamy filling that will satisfy you with a smile, even if you're not a fan of banana.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=20,3.08,3.0,3.116,3.0600000000000005,3.0320000000000005

57,Susan F.,"Romeoville, IL",3,54,,1.0,2017-06-04,"This restaurant/location has been a family favorite for years, until yesterday. Our daughter had chosen to eat here for her birthday. We always try to get there a little ahead of the dinner crowd so as to not have a long wait. We were seated quickly in a small roundish section on the front edge of the restaurant. There were many tables open in this area and they placed us at a very sunny window. I figured they would drop down some shade if needed. Waiter took our drink order and brought waters quickly, but then it was hard to find him to order appetizers or even our meals. One of the times he came to us, he was holding someone's to go bag the whole time we were ordering. I thought that was a little odd. So as the setting sun was beginning to become a problem for a few of us (and we had mentioned it to our server to no avail) the shades finally began to come down, I could see again! Then just as quickly they went back up. Again something was said to the waiter and again was not interested. And then they came down again, and went back up again. This went on for some time. It was very distracting. (I found out later that it was the table next to us that wanted them up, the shades do not work individually, stupid design and those guests were wearing sunglasses, so why didn't they just sit outside!) BTW the vegetable that came with my dish was snow peas and when I asked to switch them out with asparagus (I love their asparagus!) I was told it would cost extra. Out of the 3 salmon dishes, I was ordering the most expensive as it was and all mine came with was rice and snow peas and they wanted to charge extra for the asparagus! Outrageous, I opted for the snow peas. When my dish came out I then understood why the upcharge. The snow peas, all four of them were garnish, not an actual vegetable, shameful. Now for the real reasons we will never come back. SALT OMG!!! My husband's, and two daughters' pastas were so salty, two of them couldn't eat them at all. My son's mashed potatoes were also inedible with too much salt and pepper. We have eaten here enough times to know this wasn't normal. We said something to the waiter and he brought out only my husband a new plate of pasta, but it too was salty. The manager came out, (he was very nice) and explained that they have to keep a lot of salt in the cooking water for the pasta. Not sure why. But he did nothing to correct anything. I felt really bad for my daughter whose birthday we were there celebrating since it was her pasta that she was unable to eat. Also no birthday celebration at all for her. And after a $335 tab we had to go home and eat something else. Guess we will have to take her somewhere else to celebrate. On a side note, there was a table that was adjacent to us whom they did come out a sing Happy Birthday to, but it was truly pathetic. The staff looked and sounded like they truly didn't want to be there. It was so bad that another table of young girls said a big Happy Birthday and clapped for them at the end, which did help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=20,2.64,3.0,3.08,2.6920000000000006,2.8560000000000003

53,Rachel H.,"Chicago, IL",23,126,235.0,4.0,2017-06-20,"You really can't go wrong here. I swear they have to have one of the, if not the lengthiest menus. I mean it's a book! For some all the options can be overwhelming but, you will always find something on it to suit your taste buds I am sure. It's also always packed and usually a 30-40 minute wait on the weekends to be seated because this place is great for groups and special occasions. I enjoy the bar area to eat honestly, and it's typically first come first serve and not always crowded. I have had so many items off the menu over the years, but my favorites are the shrimp scampi and the firecracker salmon rolls. I literally some days stop in just for the salmon rolls! They're so tasty and crispy. The spicy chili sauce that comes with it is delicious too! The shrimp scampi comes with huge butterfly lightly battered shrimp that sit and swim in a linguine pasta sauce with garlic and butter and is oh so doggone good!! These dishes have never disappointed and honestly I don't think there has ever been a time I have been dissatisfied with a dish here. Some people are not into the big chain style restaurants, but I must admit this one here has proven itself over the years to be consistent with great food and great service. Their cheesecake is on another level of cheesecake. I mean like on the level you not sharing!! (lol), and I guess that is why the entire restaurant is named after it. I can eat their cheesecake all day everyday and not get tired of it. Always fresh, made as you order and come in every flavor you can think of. The strawberry is my favorite. Something about big, firm, fresh, sweet, juicy strawberry's on top of a cheesecake you just cannot get enough of. The drinks are pretty good too. My favorites are the Georgia Peach and the Strawberry Martini. My only pet-peeved here is they do not list the drink prices on their menu, which I don't understand why they do not? They list the prices of the food in the menu, so why not the drinks? If I am ordering a drink I surely wanna know how much it cost and feel silly asking the waiters how much every drink is. Sorry, but not sorry, I am not paying over $13 for no drink from nowhere. The parking on a weekend can get really congested especially since they're in the mall and in the restaurant district as I call it, so they share parking space with like 6 other restaurants, but if no parks let up after circling the parking lots over and over, you can park by Neiman Marcus, there's always  available space over there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=20,2.76,3.04,3.092,3.088,2.9280000000000004

We didn't have to wait for a seat (it was busy at the time though) so that was a plus. The waiter brought us our bread but we had no plates to eat on. He brought us our alcoholic drinks pretty quickly but failed to bring my daughter's Sprite which I had to ask again for along with plates. Appetizer came, still no plates. Finally, the young lady that brought out our food brought us some plates. Rather than taking our order before the appetizers, he waited until we were done with them to take the order. Meanwhile, we are watching people with other waiters/waitresses, place their orders, get their food, finish their food, all while we wait. Once the food came, and the young lady that brought them out was asking who had what, our waiter finally decides that it's a good time to interrupt her and see if we wanted another alcoholic drink. Very rude and disrespectful to the server trying to give the customer their meal. The food itself was fantastic. The wait time was less than pleasant.

The steak was average, we asked for medium and seemed more medium rare. We didn't have room for desserts but we did get drinks.

I have been dining at The Cheesecake Factory for a little over a year now. Me and my girlfriend have made it a staple visit at least once a month for the last 9 months. With that being said, my most recent visit has almost entirely ruined this destination. After our arrival, we were advised that our wait time would be ""no more than twenty minutes."" At least thats what the hostess said. Forty-five minutes later, and after having to watch multiple people who arrived after us be seated before us, we were finally seated. Our waiter seemed to prefer talking with his coworkers more than helping us, it took him approximately 15 minutes to bring us our DRINK ORDER. At first i just thought he was extremely busy, until we spotted him behind their staff station, very clearly laughing and messing around with the other waiters/ waitresses for about 5 minutes straight. Not only that, but when i tried to lighten the mood with a joke as we were ordering, stating that i was skipping liquor for the night, to be the DD; our waiter said to me, and i quote: ""Ive been stuck in that situation before buddy, but even when im the DD, I drink more than everyone else!""...... My date and I did not find this funny, as we both know someone who was killed by a drunk driver. Onto the food. I ordered a Cuban Sandwich with fries, and my girlfriend ordered the Fehttuchini Alfredo with chicken. My sandwich arrived cold, and not toasted. Her pasta arrived in a much smaller quantity than it usually does. After trying a few bites of both, we both agreed that the quality of our food had severely declined. We decided it was time to leave, asked for the check, and waited another 20 minutes for him to bring it to us. The total for our meals came out to $48.56, and after a tip, $56.56. However, I still wanted desert, so i let my girlfriend run to the car while I grabbed a spot in line, 15 minutes later, my order was taken. One slice of Lemoncello Torte. I kid you not, i waited 25 minutes for one slice of overpriced cake. (a little over $9.50 i believe). I am writing this review with great disappointment, as I gave this establishment a four star review last month. As of right now, i do not see myself continuing my tradition. Over $60 of my hard earned money, essentially down the drain. Very sad. I hope to hear from customer service, i have receipts to prove this night took place.

Hung up and called back a manager immediately picked up sounded like she was in the back office, she told me that there was a long line of people and that's why I was on hold for so long. She didn't know that I was staying at the hotel across the street, so when I WALKED by I saw two people there. I got the manager on the phone just to let her know that we took our business elsewhere.

AWFUL WILTED SOGGY SALAD  Honestly felt like I was eating someone's leftovers or salad that was a week old! After 2 bites my companion and I opted to let the waiter know / he offered a new salad ( NO THANKS) or fries ( which I don't eat) We declined - I later asked if he let manager know he said he did - but then when manager came over to our table he was a bit dumbfounded - at which point our plates were cleared. He offered a free dessert - we split one This salad should NEVER have been used PERIOD! I would hope that someone in the kitchen is monitoring what is being served before it gets played. The salad leaves were slimey and non-edible - hoping we won't get sick  NOT going back anytime soon -  Very disappointing!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=20,3.4,3.14,3.072,2.436,3.2440000000000007

One day the floor in the washroom was so wet my young child fell and bumped her chin on the nasty wet washroom floor.  I walked up to the manager with her and we both told him what happened and all he said was he's have an employee take a look at it. Not at all sympathetic  To be completely honest with you, he blew it off  I was really disappointed.  I love the cheesecake and when the food is on point it's delicious !  But the washrooms and the smoking RIGHT outside the door to walk in are huge turnoffs.  If we're going to wait for over an hour for a table, things need to improve !   I can promise you from the bottom of my heart that the management has been notified several times regarding the washrooms being filthy.

First, I called to ask what the estimated wait was for 2 people. The person who answered said 20/25 minutes. When I got there, they told me 30. I expected that, no problem. I arrived at 5:40PM. At 30 mins, I asked how much longer, and the hostess said 5 minutes. At 50 minutes, I was frustrated. I had a 7:15 movie to get to. I also wanted to do a starter, dinner, and dessert, and this was cutting it close. I spoke with the hostess and she was very dismissive and unapologetic. She said they couldn't account for people sitting there. I told her that's fine, but give me realistic expectations. If she told me 45 minutes when I got there, I would have left. She then argued with me that I have been waiting 43 minutes, not 48. I told her I have a text to my bf saying the wait when I got there at 5:40, so they waited to enter me in. She said no it automatically does it. She was rude and not good at her job. Finally we were seated and I figured it would still be okay but it took the waiter 10 minutes to walk over to us. I tried flagging other people down but no one came close. We were only able to enjoy our main dish. I had to take our cheesecakes to go. The food was good, and the waiter after that was nice. I asked him for the manager and he said he asked for them twice and they also never came. If management doesnt show up, why would their employees.

They told us any minute 40 minutes in to our wait, then again an hour and 20 minutes into wait. They called us just to tell us to wait some more to the side. Servers were running around and bumping into people. The few times I got up from my seat, servers were bumping into me, with no apology.  Our server was so busy/apathetic. His name was Marcelino. We waited in the lobby (with a toddler) for an hour and 45 minutes. We were told it would be 45 minute wait. We sat down and waited for a server to greet us. He didn't say his name just asked if we were ready to order. We asked for another minute. He was about to leave when I had to say that I wanted to order a drink. I asked for a extra dirty martini. It was not extra dirty or dirty at all. I actually went up to the bartender and requested more olive juice. Our waiter saw me do this and asked nothing as to why.  He didn't come back to our table for another 20 minutes before we could order food. (we have a toddler). I asked for a kids menu. Never brought it until a member of our party asked a different waiter. (This took until our server came back 20 mins later.) for him to check on us to get the kids menu. We ordered apps and dinner. Our food was great. All except the kids chicken nuggets that I ordered for my toddler. We asked to have fruit instead of fries. They bring out fries. Fine. They said they would bring us out a fruit bowl. Minutes later, they take the fries away to give to another member of our table. Without a word. Weird, we thought. Since, already they messed up, why wouldn't they just let us keep the fries and bring out the other persons fries an additional order. That is usually what restaurants do. The Chicken fingers were horrible. We got them for our 18 months old and it was all breading. We had to really tear apart the chicken fingers to get to meat, which is all we would be giving to our child. I honestly expected more.  Overall, really disappointing. I think its been about 10 years since I have been here. I don't plan on coming back. I know that this last weekend was really busy for you all, but there has to be a better way.

Food is decent, the portions are out of control large, and the cheesecake is a must.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook,2.92,3.12,3.096,,3.0400000000000005
3,Nina H.,"Chicago, IL",2,20,14.0,1.0,2018-01-05,So we're going on 90 minutes of waiting after being told that the wait was 50 minutes!  So as a result of the sunk cost fallacy we continued to wait because we had invested so much time already. But I am beyond pissed so this food better be beyond delicious and this server better bring it!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook,2.8,3.08,3.084,,2.9680000000000004
8,G S.,"Chicago, IL",8,96,230.0,1.0,2018-01-05,We were told 45 mins for a table and it's been 1 hours and 30 minutes. No food worth this wait. My last time here. Get with the times and take reservations. I'm not coming back here ever again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook,2.8,3.06,3.068,,2.9560000000000004
9,S. C.,"Aurora, IL",4,19,3.0,3.0,2018-01-07,"We were a party of 5 midafternoon on a Sunday. It was pretty busy. We didn't have reservations and waited 30 minutes for a table. Drinks were brought promptly. There was a little wait to order our meal but the food arrived faster than expected and our server made sure we didn't run out of bread. The dishes were tasty but not spectacular. The food that was supposed to be hot was and the cold food was chilled just right. My water wasn't refilled as quickly as I like, my son had to remind the waiter to bring his soda, and also the dressing for his fries. It was a good meal. I would visit this restaurant again but this time it didn't deserve five stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook,2.88,3.04,3.06,,2.9760000000000004
1,Ellen M.,"Oak Park, IL",454,1259,161.0,3.0,2018-01-07,"People just love this place, especially out of town friends, and I can never understand it. Fortunately, they have avocado toast, so I'll always be ok. Amazingly, they serve cuisine from a number of ethnicities, but with...well, suburban American flair. Most plates look appealing enough. Everything is very salty though, and I get the impression that there's not a lot of fresh ingredients in the kitchen.  The first thing they want to know is what overpriced wine you'd like. It smacks of efficiency; corporate food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook,2.96,3.02,3.056,,2.9960000000000004
