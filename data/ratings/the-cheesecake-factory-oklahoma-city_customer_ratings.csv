107,Sharon M.,"Mesa, AZ",94,242,93.0,3.0,2012-03-10,"I like Cheesecake Factory every now and again. This CF is exactly like any other CF I've ever been to. Just like the one in SLC and just like the 2 I ate at in AZ before moving here. There is nothing unique about any particular CF, it's a chain restaurant but one that I tend to enjoy for my birthday.  We had a pretty good experience as far as food goes. In fact service and food were all fantastic until my bff said ""It's her birthday"" and not for the obvious ""they're gonna sing and embarass me"" reason. It literally took 20 minutes to get my cheesecake with ""happy birthday to you"" written in chocolate on the plate's rim.  Other than that: I requested pasta with my samlon instead of mashed potatoes. While the request was granted without any fuss the noodles were undercooked and stuck together. The sweet corn tamale cakes though, were so so good!  I'm not a big fan of corporate restaurants. I typically prefer and dine with local companies, just sayin'",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oklahoma-city?start=100,3.1160000000000005,3.1160000000000005,3.1160000000000005,3.1160000000000005,3.116000000000001

125,Addison G.,"Oklahoma City, OK",147,108,8.0,2.0,2012-07-14,Typical chain. Nothing special. The food is decent. The portions are HUGE! The service can be hit or miss.

136,Niki S.,"Murphy, TX",31,208,,3.0,2012-12-01,"Sometimes a corporate chain place is exactly what you need.  If you are going out to eat with a group that has varying tastes, it's nice to take out the mystery element.  I like The Cheesecake Factory because I know what to expect.  The atmosphere is a little more upscale than your average family restaurant.  Casual enough to be relaxed but just fancy enough to celebrate a birthday or anniversary.     This location is free standing but next to a large shopping mall.  The menu is extensive so definitely email out a link to the indecisive.  I do like that you can order a lunch special on the weekends.  The portions are still gigantic and their warm bread basket is addictive.  I usually skip appetizers in an attempt to save room for cheesecake but the avocado rolls are really good.  Imagine a mix between guacamole and eggs rolls- the best of both worlds.     Besides cheesecake, the reason I go to CF is for pasta.  I feel a little less guilty splurging on a bowl of the Fettuccine with Chicken and Sun Dried Tomatoes when I know I am just minutes away from chasing it with a cheesecake induced sugar rush.  I like to get all my sinning done in one sitting.  My sweety likes the steak and eggs on the brunch menu.    They do offer a Skinnylicious menu if you want lighter fare but that just seems like a way to make your table mates feel bad about themselves. Do you want to be ""that"" guy or girl?   The service was good even though we went during the Sunday brunch rush.  The one thing I would suggest is to ask to keep one menu as that table to browse the cheesecake flavors.  My favorites are the Key Lime, Lemon Raspberry and White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle.  Don't plan anything too ambitious for about 4 hours after a trip to the Cheesecake Factory- usually a nap while watching TV will help you through the food fog.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oklahoma-city?start=120,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004

My husband had the carbonara which he said was not carbonara and did not taste good. I had the lettuce wraps which they didn't even bring out to me until ten mins after my husband got his meal. The manager however did apologize and asked me if I wanted a soup or salad while I waited, but I declined. Anywho.. my lettuce wraps only had one tiny piece of chicken, and was not satisfying.

106,Nicole P.,"Norman, OK",69,53,52.0,2.0,2013-04-07,"I usually try to stay away from chain restaurants because I think the food lacks the extra love and attention needed to make a good meal, but I had a $40 gift card to The Cheesecake Factory and I needed to go to Penn Square Mall anyway. My experience today reconfirmed (for the hundredth or so time) my distrust of chains. Let me start with the good news - the cheesecake at The Cheesecake Factory is amazing. Every dessert I've ever had from here has been consistently, sinfully delicious. They have a huge variety of cheesecakes to choose from and the display is enough to make my mouth water. I've tried several different kinds, but my favorite is the simple classic cheesecake with strawberries and whip cream. I know they get all of their desserts shipped in. Nothing is made in-house. This is usually a big food turn-off for me, but the deliciousness of the cheesecakes wins me over. I love it! Even though you're looking at around $7 a slice, I think it's totally worth it. I can't say the same about the non-bakery items. Ok, so I will say the complimentary sourdough and dark honey-wheat bread they serve is great. I was really hungry when we got there and happy to find out I didn't have to wait for our food to get a little nibble in. However, after the bread, my meal went way downhill. I ordered scrambled eggs with potatoes and a bagel with cream cheese. The eggs looked and tasted like edible plastic and the potatoes were over-processed and bland-tasting. My favorite thing was the bagel and cream cheese, but even the bagel was burnt a little bit. I really haven't had a good food experience any time I've visited this restaurant and I have come to discover that a ridiculously long menu usually equals blah food as is the case here. Also, although our waitress was sweet and somewhat attentive, I think the servers might be overworked here. Everyone seemed frantic and frazzled. And why do they make them all wear white everything?!? Not a good look for frazzled wait staff in my opinion. I guess the moral of this story is, BREAK THE CHAINS unless you are satisfied with bland food. But do go in and pick up a cheesecake if you're in the area. You won't be disappointed with that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oklahoma-city?start=100,2.9520000000000004,2.9520000000000004,2.9520000000000004,2.9520000000000004,2.952000000000001

Discovering that I had more than one option was the best part of our visit. The service was just awful. The waitress was super dismissive and kept looking everywhere but at us while she was taking our order. We had to ask her repeatedly for basic things like silverware, bread plates, napkins, and sugar. Once we got our food, she didn't come back; we had to flag down someone for our check. This was annoying, but the worst part of our visit was undoubtedly the food. I had the veggie burger. It fell apart pretty much immediately and the flavor was kind of weirdly sweet. My kids had mac and cheese and bowtie alfredo; both were undercooked with watery sauce.  I might go to Cheesecake Factory again if I had a gift card, but not if I was paying for it. It was really mediocre.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oklahoma-city?start=100,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003
86,Joe C.,"Oklahoma City, OK",99,619,139.0,3.0,2013-08-26,"So look, Cheesecake Factory is certainly not going to be confused with fine dining any time soon. Here's one thing I'll throw out about them: Most chains figure they're going to do one thing well, and then they'll add a few throwaway dishes to cover the tastes of the folks who aren't interested in whatever they're most ""proud"" of. This is how you wind up with people like my [redacted], who will think nothing of ordering a glass of Chardonnay at a run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurant. Cheesecake Factory, on the other hand, has attempted to create mass-market, easily replicable and average-quality food that will appeal to the tastes of ANYONE who walks in the door. Any four random pages of their menu book would be more than enough for your average chain, and they have way, way more than four pages. I've had the food more than I wish, and while it isn't great, it is usually at least average and keeps that standard across the ridiculous variety of stuff they're churning out. And I also give them bonus points for having the word ""factory"" in their name. It's not like they're hiding what they're up to, are they? You need great service to get to ""above average"" for this kind of place, and I've never had that at this location. But there are chains out there doing way less ambitious work, and not doing it as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oklahoma-city?start=80,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.052000000000001

Fantastic. His girlfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich and my husband had the factory burger. They both enjoyed theirs. The appetizers were yummy as well-firecracker salmon and the artichoke and spinach cheese dip. What is worth mentioning here is the manner in which we were treated. I have been here many times as it is the only Factory within a bazillion miles. It is ALWAYS crowded. This is not a problem for me. I am fully prepared to wait. However, I do not appreciate being rushed. If one is going to spend a hundred bucks for a meal, I think the option of at least wiping your mouth after the last bite should be open to you. We had barely laid our forks down before the bill was received and plates were whisked away.  I don't appreciated being pressured to leave because the Factory failed to build a big enough building.

I gave four stars because my husband's favorite dish is the Steak Dianne, and it's pretty darn good. I've always received good service here, though it can be a little slow with a large lunch crowd. The lunch portions are still pretty large and will fill you up, though I'm not sure if it's the food or complimentary bread that fills me up more.

I went this afternoon at 4 for an early dinner with my fiance and we were surprised at the lack of parking spot and how busy it was at this time.  The reason? I believe it was because of their great lunch special which lasts till 5 pm!! I got the spicy Chipotle chicken. They say lunch portion but I couldn't even eat half of it. I saw a sign in the front door and it said there is happy hour from Monday to Friday from 4-6pm on select appetizer being 5$. Considering their appetizers are usually 10 dollars this is a great deal to go with friends for an early dinner and try their wonderful small dishes.

Our hostess sat my date and I at a tiny, two-person table squeezed in between two full tables. One of the tables was full of very loud teenage girls obsessed with selfies.  Anyways, back to the food. I asked for a water with lemon, pretty basic, but never got a lemon all night even after asking the waiter multiple times. I ordered the shrimp BLT and a side salad. The salad was a good mix of greens with a very yummy, chunky blue cheese dressing. The sandwich was massive! It had thick strips of crispy bacon and large slices of tomato, although the tomato had not fully ripened yet (yay green tomatoes!). There was very little shrimp which was disappointing because let's face it, shrimp is the whole reason for living! Next up, the cheese cake!!! I ordered red velvet cheese cake and my date had the cookie dough. They were both pretty epic. The cookie dough cake has actual cookie dough in the middle! Wow. The red velvet is worth the $10 and it's so huge that I had cheese cake for the next three nights.  All in all, I would recommended this place to someone during a weekday.

I nibbled on the bread they brought to the table while I waited.  The dark wheat bread had a soft but chewy texture with caramel notes that left a smoky after taste.  It seemed a shame to relegate it to pre-dinner munching.  it is worth a starring role.  The white bread was far chewier and crunchy with a glutinous texture that spoke of peasant roots and hinted at a missed calling to the status of crouton makings. The atmosphere was upscale but noisy with dim lighting that went for intimate but achieved an open crowded vibe. The burger arrived. I opted for mayo in lieu of the tartar sauce like not so ""special sauce."" The bun was soft but we'll toasted. it was high class enough to hang out in a joint like this but down to earth enough to be a proper hamburger bun. The beef was soft but pallid. Light on beefy flavor The patty left most of the flavor to the bacon. The Bacon itself was charred past the point of crispy and tasted only a moment from being burned. The cheese was delightfully creamy and gave quiet support to the rest of the burger The fries were lightly golden brown and delicious... They were right out of a dictionary definition of American French fries. My overall opinion is tentative worth ordering again if you""'re comming here with friends and want a burger instead of something else.  If I ever come back I will explore the menu for something else. I took home a piece of Strawberry Cheesecake (It didn't seem right not to try the cheesecake at a place called The Cheesecake Factory.

66,Anisah H.,"Manhattan, NY",20,299,358.0,1.0,2015-11-17,"They couldn't just take the gnocchi noodles back and apologize, they had to insult my professionally trained palate! First I would just like to say that I have been preparing various types of pasta since  I was 8 years old starting out under my mother and grandmother in the kitchen; with that being said I stand almost 30 years old and I know exactly what al dente pasta is and how it should be achieved depending on which pasta is being prepared. Today around 2:00 pm I stopped in to pick up a dinner portion of Fettuccine alfredo with grilled chicken to go, to share for lunch. What I was served was something reminiscent of gnocchi in fettuccine form. This culinary faux pas may happen for a number of reasons, one being the water to noodle ratio is incorrect, (not enough water to noodles) which was most likely the problem here.  I placed the food back in the original container and returned for a refund to be insulted by some person who didn't even tatse the food in order to qualify to have an opinion on the dish. How dare you? Next time, apologize, then offer to make the food properly, and if you are seriously sorry offer a free soft drink or dessert. Never insinuate that a customer doesn't comprehend what a basic dish of anything should be. You take the payments so take the payments and mind your manners, do not tell me that people enjoy eating rubbery chewy doughy pasta, those people and you apparently need to make pasta-mush-gum paste in their own kitchens on your own time  because as a  restaurant you should set the bar higher than that, you should know better, you shouldn't be wasting my time, and your customer service should be basic if not better. I paid for fettuccine not your idea of edible play-doh or your crass opinion in general. Al dente does not equal gumdrops.

The wait was at 15-20 minutes and we got seated 5 minutes into the wait so was a relief. Here comes the frustrating part. The hostess sat us down and I asked where my highchair was and she said she would bring it right out. I don't like to sit down with my 13 month old unless he is in his highchair otherwise once the highchair arrives he will only want to be in my arms. Something any toddler mom can understand. I am standing there for about 5 minutes while the hostess continues to sit people and no server in sight. I finally walk up to the hostess and she said ""sorry we are out"". While she is saying the word ""out"" she is walking away from me not allowing me to ask how long my wait would be. I go sit down. Finally 10 minutes later our server arrives to take the drink order. Long story short I ate my entire meal with one hand while holding my toddler in the other. Incredibly frustrating having to do that while paying $17 per plate and $7 for a kids meal. I did ask the server and even the manager 2-3 times if there was one available during our meal and the answer was no every time. I am never visiting this place again.

We got seated and it just took a long time to get some service. The table beside us was seated a few minutes after us and someone greeted them immediately. They received their drinks fast too. After all that, we finally got some service. As it turns out, we had the same server. I guess he could only tend one table at a time. My wife asked for the nutritional menu. It's common practice for her to ask and receive one. The server didn't quite know what that was. He said he would check. He comes back and says they don't have one available. Ok fine. My wife decided to order a turkey sandwich but we were told they are out of turkey. My wife goes to her next option; they are out of that too.

She made us feel right at home, so much so that I'd recommend asking for her by name to anyone going to this particular location.  I did have one complaint, but it had absolutely nothing to do with the service. The tile floor was hazardously slick throughout the restaurant. I was concerned about face-planting on the way to our table and every time I left my seat. It's like there was grease smeared all over the floor. Honestly, even if this was never remedied, it wouldn't scare us away. People like Laura will always bring in repeat customers.

You can usually count on great service, great meals, great desert... and a fairly large bill. I don't mind that bill thing if all the other characteristics are in place, but Saturday night was a complete fail on their part. We started out with one server and after our order was placed, we had someone new. Our drinks were never refilled and we rarely saw our server. My daughter ordered the BBQ burger with the sauce on the side (pretty difficult huh). It came out fully drenched in BBQ ranch sauce. My daughter and I received our meals but our server said he would be right out with my wife's meal (chicken madeira). So we waited....and waited...and waited until a manager walked up and said her meal was served to the wrong table. He apologized and refilled our drinks because our waiter was no where to be seen. Several minutes later we were getting antsy because we were going to be late for our movie. Several more minutes pass and here comes the manager with her food. He offered to buy us a piece of cheesecake but we explained we were running late for our movie. He then offered to discount (not delete) the cost of her meal. It seemed like his biggest concern was getting off without giving a freebie. My wife said we would take the discount. We hurried through our meal to get to the movie. Our waiter then appeared briefly, just long enough to drop off the fully priced meal. Apparently the manager WAS really concerned about his margin. He never got that ""partial discount"" applied to our meal. I think he knew we were, at that point, in too big of a hurry to wait for a corrected check.

Overall we greatly enjoyed our meal, the food was flavorful and the perfect temperature. It's always disappointing to go to a busy restaurant and get cold food, but here it was on point. Another plus to this trip was our table-bread was actually warm! Our cheesecake was delicious and really cured my sweet tooth for the weekend. The only downside to our trip to C.F. was service. It had nothing to do with our waiter or the waitstaff that helped us, but more on the organization of the waitstaff. It seemed for the entire patio of at least a dozen tables, there was only our one server. He would have to carry out orders for three different tables at a time to keep caught up. Me and my wife are pretty patient, so we expected to be there awhile. But it was easy to see that some customers were getting irate with the lack of service. Maybe it was the heat...

Here are my two issues with this restaurant: 1.   They do not have a traditional New York cheesecake with a firm, dense texture as opposed to more of a pudding like texture.  Very strange indeed. 2.  And, most important to me.  Why do they put the silverware directly on the tables?  That is simply gross.  Interestingly enough, they wrap the eating utensils in a cloth napkin for the outside tables, but do not do so for indoor dining and it just sits on the table itself.  Even IHOP or Denny's will place the eating utensils on paper placemats. I have mentioned this issue to my servers and have even written a comment on their website.  They all say they wipe the tables down, but have you noticed that they use the same wet rag at each table?  I've seen way too many kids and adults putting their hands and arms all over the tables after they cough and sneeze and then, after the table is cleared with this soiled, wet rag, down go the eating utensils for the next party.  It's just not very appetizing.   I can't believe I'm the only patron that has noticed this disgusting practice.  I always request they bring me the ""wrapped"" set of utensils which they do without any protest.  Nevertheless, the practice is a black eye on a mostly decent restaurant if not for this one issue.   To me, until the management resolves this issue, the restaurant only deserves two stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oklahoma-city?start=20,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.9200000000000004,3.0800000000000005

Again, they were ok but nothing I found exceptional.   I found on the bill that soft drinks were $3, lemonade $4 and regular coffee was also $3. Average food and unexceptional desserts, even if a bit overpriced based on ingredient, quality and taste are something I can live with.

(Sounds better if you pretend Charles Barkley is saying it) I wanted to grab a quick bite with the family before I headed out town for work. I let my daughter pick and she picked here. This place always sounds better than it is.  From the beginning it was terrible. They asked if I had any children in the party. (I get this. I was single and childless once but. Come on. Let's not be so obvious). I said yes and they sat me in the worst table by the kitchen. I sure hope the waiter I had was new because he was terrible. About 10 minutes from being seated to him coming to the table. Then. He dropped off the menus  and I had to stop him from leaving to give him a drink order. It got worse from there. Like I said. I hope he was new.  The food was gross. My daughter got garlic noodles. Obvious garlic salt and I think they spilled it in there. It was saltier than anything I have ever had. I probably should check my blood pressure.  I had sausage and shrimp. Sauce was terrible and the sausage had about as much a presence as you will see in a women's locker room.  Children's menu was typical of a place that really doesn't want children.  Dessert. Couple pieces of cheese cake. I really do not see what the hype is.  There was obviously no real baker back there.

We waited 10 minutes to get our drinks. He also brought us out some bread and we finished it before he could even come back and take our order. The Sunday brunch sounded wonderful. I ordered "" fried chicken and waffles Benedict "". My hubby ordered a burger. We have a 17 month old daughter so she would just share with us. We waited and waited for our food to come out. Our waiter never offered more bread. A table seated after us got their food first. Finally our food arrived. It looked great. Big portions. Unfortunately I wasn't a fan of my food. I managed to get down half a waffle and that was it. Our waiter never came by to see how we were doing or how the food was tasting.

There are restaurants in the city where you can taste the freshness of the food for a fraction of the price. And how ""none of the food is frozen"" when they have a menu the size of a Harry Potter book is beyond me.  The food is outrageously overpriced. I'm no fool - this is a chain restaurant. The $20 plates of food come frozen in bags. Tastes good, but not worth the price. I can spend less on a plate at a restaurant that uses fresh ingredients and makes things from scratch.  However, there are two things to come here for: the cheesecake and the appetizers. We all know their cheesecake slays the game. Their appetizers are some of the best I've had at any restaurant and they are large in portion size. The avocado egg rolls and the sauce that comes with them are to die for. And who doesn't love the mac and cheese balls? Ditch the regular menu. You can easily pick an appetizer and just order that as your entree; you'll walk out just as full and you'll probably have spent $10 less per person.  As far as service goes, it's always been decent at this location.

This is the only Cheesecake Factory in Oklahoma City metro areas and they get very busy all the time. I'm definitely a fan and I LOVE their cheesecakes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oklahoma-city,3.44,3.2,3.2,,3.2960000000000007
3,Jeff M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",423,586,1166.0,3.0,2017-08-21,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again: The Cheesecake Factory (TCF) is where willpower and waistlines go to die. And my goodness, it's so easy to fail at any healthy eating attempts if this place becomes a frequent stop for you. Supposedly, their 250 menu items are made from scratch daily, which makes me want to know what their definition of ""from scratch"" is more than anything. Prices have gone up though, so really, this is increasingly becoming a great place to get your dessert fix only, since there are definitely better options for dining out, even by chain restaurant standards. Our meal with family ended up being just slightly shy of $140. That's Cheever's money at that point. Speaking of increased prices... This happened yesterday: [] Update at the bottom of this essay [] I ordered something called the ""Crispy Chicken Costoletta"" listed on the menu at $17.95. ""Whatever"" I thought, since most everything on the menu is in that range. I figured the portions were going to be massive, so yay. Then the bill arrived, and I noticed that I was charged $19.45 for the CCC.  So I ask my server for clarification. I even had to point it out on the menu because he didn't seem like he believed me. A few minutes later, he comes back and tells me that his manager said that the prices had gone up on a number of the menu items by ""just a dollar"" (it's more than a dollar, but who's counting? Besides me...). And then he asked if it would be okay for me to go ahead and pay the $19.45. lolwut?  There were a number of options on how to deal with the price change(s):         (a) Take the low-effort Asian restaurant route, and cover the old price with a sticker.         (b) Eat the cost of your mistake, and fix the price when requested by the customer.         (c) Ask the customer politely to accept your bait & switch. He actually chose (c) and with manager approval too, it seems. I mean, yes, it's only $1.50, but I was like ""WTH?"" to even being told:  - Yeah, our prices changed...  - Yeah, we didn't note it anywhere...  - Yeah, could you go ahead and just pay the new price? No, guy. No. I mean, thanks for asking so nicely, but this was like the easiest customer-service resolution ever, and you botched it. And this weak-sauce customer service thing is the one thing (other than the delicious cheesecake) that seems to be oddly consistent about this TCF in particular. Man, this review got long...  P. S. I had someone from ""Guest Services"" reach out to me, to explain that you cannot do any substitutions. At all. The server had told me that I could swap out the mashed potatoes for the corn succotash, and it turns out that... You can't... So, yeah... Crispy Chicken Costoletta ($17.95) + Corn Succotash ($1.50) = $19.45. Okay, fair enough...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oklahoma-city,3.48,3.18,3.18,,3.3000000000000007

My wife always gets the Tea, it has a unique flavor with hints of fruit. It gives me the willies so I pass. But go for it if it's your bag. The absolute always order, no questions asked, is the chicken pot stickers as an appetizer. The sauce is spectacular, I never let any go to waste by sponging it up with the delicate stickers or delicious fresh bread. Tonight I was feeling adventurous. So I exchanged my usual, Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp (I'm a curry junkie) for the Miso Salmon. And let me tell you, it changed my life. Who knew salmon could taste so great in Oklahoma? The fish was fresh, flaked properly, and was covered in a Miso sauce that was oh so creamy fantastic.  I passed on cheesecake tonight. But recommend the Red Velvet.

It was good, but nothing to write home about. The green salad was just lettuce. No other veggies were on the salad. I thought that was odd and the dressing they poured on it made the greens a little soggy.  Our service was okay, a little slow at times.

2,Mary Margaret M.,"Edmond, OK",72,147,2415.0,3.0,2017-12-08,"Classic Cheesecake Factory experience here: everything and the kitchen sink is on their menu. It's all served family style (one order is enough for a family of three-across the board).  My staple is the Louisiana chicken pasta. It's so subtly spicy and flavorful and a HUGE portion. One time at this location we found a hair (an obvious ""there's no way it's mine"" hair) in this dish. Staff was apologetic. They removed it from our check and replaced the dish with another one, which was the acceptable way to handle the situation.  Recently tried the Nashville chicken appetizer and it was good. I like the flavor-there could have been more pickles and a lot less grease.  Recently tried the Tuscan chicken from the Skinny-licious menu. There was enough meal there for 3 people; completely shareable for dinner for two with leftovers. The farro was skimpy, but I guess that's where the Skinny-licious part comes in. It was served with tons of tomatoes and had great flavor.  Cheesecake Factory cheesecake is universal at all locations, which I appreciate. Love the white chocolate raspberry. Recently learned a piece of cheesecake is somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,000-ish calories. Plan ahead and bring a cheesecake buddy (or several) who have similar tastes to you, or plan to take a week to eat it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oklahoma-city,3.28,3.21,3.21,,3.238

1,Donna C.,"Edmond, OK",162,55,26.0,3.0,2018-01-07,"For a chain restaurant, The Cheesecake Factory has pretty good food. The menu is a book with everything you could possibly think of. I've tried several of their dishes, but the only category that I found quite disappointing in taste and texture was the pasta. The wheat bread and butter is delicious. I'm not a fan of sourdough, so I am biased with my opinion on that. With our 20 minute wait, it gave my party plenty of time to look at the menu and pick our entrees. When we were seated, we ordered our drinks and went ahead and ordered our entrees to make things easier on our server (including a bowl of lemons for our water, straws, and extra bread). Service took a while. And we had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the items listed above. Food was good. I got the steak with salmon with a side of mashed potatoes and corn succotash. The asparagus were wilted and the size of match sticks. My family's entrees were also satisfying in taste. The server clearly forgot to put in an order and said under her breath as she was thinking, ""I'll get that out as soon as possible."" Not recognizing that she was at fault for this... (We're usually understanding and nice when we dine out, but I'll judge if you play it off like we forgot to tell you!!!)... so that kind of left a bad taste in my mouth.  Anywho, we finished out entrees, already had our meals boxed up and bagged. The server comes back with the missed order and told us it was actually taken to another table and they had to make a new one. Thanks?? We're clearly full. I was hoping it would get comped since we ordered this from the beginning, she had forgotten, and it came out when we were about to leave. We obviously paid it and took it togo... Tonight, it wasn't worth the hassle to even mention it. Justified that bad taste in my mouth, but.... whatevs. I noticed there's never a manager that walks around asking how things are going whenever I've visited. Cheesecake has always been divine. I recommend the Kahlua or the lemon raspberry.  Overall, the price is expensive so, expect to easily rack up your bill.
