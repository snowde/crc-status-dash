136,RJ J.,"Palos Park, IL",1,5,,5.0,2012-12-09,"We went around 10:55pm, just to have something small, drinks, and cheesecake.  Our waitress was Heidi G.  She was great, and it was only her third day on the job.  She explained the menu perfectly, and was great.   We loved her so much.  We had an egift card we wanted to use, and it was not going through, and Heidi was great the way she handled it.  She let us call customer service, to figure out why it wasn't working, and this was after they closed, and we weren't the last ones there.  She was so kind and patient.  The atmosphere was great, I felt like I wasn't in Illinois anymore, I didn't want to leave.  The cheesecake was amazing, as well as the drinks.  The appetizers could have been a little better, I would have rated a 4, but because of our experience with Heidi, it was more than a 5.  We will be back definitely, and we will be requesting Heidi every time we visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orland-park?start=260,2.772,2.772,2.772,2.772,2.7720000000000002
43,Rick B.,"Orland Park, IL",41,692,383.0,4.0,2012-12-10,"Pretty typical Cheesecake Factory - and that is a good thing. Perfect location inside the Orland Square Mall. Great place to wait for your shoppers or to have a meal after. This is the largest sit-down restaurant in the Mall, and the only one that really isn't fast food like the variety in the center Mall. While in a different location, this restaurant replaces the Ruby Tuesday's that used to fill the same niche. One can enter from the Mall or from the outside when the Mall is closed.  The menu is extensive, just like other Cheesecake Factorys. Nice selection. Since this site has been open less than a week, it will take a bit of time to work out all the bugs ... but good for them making the Christmas rush. They should do well.

264,Brittany T.,"Park Forest, IL",0,3,,5.0,2012-12-17,"Just walking into this place was heavenly. You would never think that an establishment such as the Cheesecake Factory was in a mall. We walked in and the place was very clean, neat, orderly and set up quite nicely.  Our server, Joycelyn asked us if we have ever been to a Cheesecake Factory restaurant before, and when we said no, she gave us an entire rundown of the background of the restaurant.   We had such wonderful service, she  made lots of recommendations. I'm glad she recommended the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake because its my favorite now.  I absolutely enjoyed her service she was very helpful and attentive.  The only thing I don't like about this place is that it gets very crowded, in the parking lot, and dining room, so you should definitely make a reservation before making a trip here, but if you don't that's ok too. It's worth the wait.  I will request Joycelyn every time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orland-park?start=240,2.7079999999999997,2.7079999999999997,2.7079999999999997,2.7079999999999997,2.7079999999999997

My date's fish and chips were unappetizing brown blocks on top of lettuce leaves. My blueberry white chocolate cheesecake did not warrant the $8? a slice.

We decided to see if we could grab a spot at the bar and were lucky enough to have a table (open seating in bar) open up in under 15 minutes. The wait is 60-90 minutes here any time of the day! People are really waiting for this?  I was pleased with the service. They were friendly and efficient. Our food was OK. The fried mac and cheese was probably the best thing we ordered. The parmesan chicken sandwich came out with onions all over it (not listed on menu). Just a little disappointing when you are paying over $100 for dinner. Most importantly, the cheesecake isn't as good as I remember it.

Its great for the mall which really needed a decent restaurant and Orland doesn't have a lot of variety so I think it will do well.  Love Cheesecake factory but its servings are way too large for one person. So my husband split everything from here and even then the servings are over the top.  I wish they would work on a few dishes which are nutrarian: high density nutrition greens without any refined carbs or fat or oils. Some fruit in salad without high salt content beans would be awesome.  The place was packed, had a line out the door after Christmas and we would go back. I just wish they would have a small menu for people on special diets.  Thanks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orland-park?start=200,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.5120000000000005
127,Jim N.,"Orland Park, IL",16,44,7.0,1.0,2013-01-06,"We waited till this week to try it because I always want to wait a week or so to let a new restaurant get the kinks out. Waited 2 hours on a Saturday afternoon from 3 to 5 to sit down for a table of 5. First mistake by me.The sad part was that we waited so long and then it was about 2 hours to get our food and eat. The service is just too slow between courses. From taking 5 minuets to get drinks, to 30 minuets to get appitizers and so on. We had to send back two food items on top of that. My wifes meal was the Luisiana Chicken pasta the chicken was a parmasean batter. It came out cold. The chicken was acually cold. My wife cut up the pieces just to see if they would just re heat it or re make it. It came back with the same chicken on it. My onion rings were a batter mush, soagy droopy cold onion rings. Well, they put a new order of onion rings in for me and the actually just put the plate under a warmer and re heated the dish for my wife. A restaurant with these type of prices should never do that. Hell, even Mcdonalds re makes your food for you if it is wrong. So disapointed in this place. Long wait and over priced for below average food. Everyones dish was just barley warm at that.We were just so frusrtrated waiting so long we just could not send everything back Nothing hot. We sat there looking at the food just sitting under the warmer. They also brought the food out in stages. Two people got their dish and then we waited for the next two to come out about 3 minutes later and then the last about 2 minuets later. They could not bring out all at the same time. I feel like such a fool to wait then get served garbage. Almost $200 thrown away. PLEASE do not waste your time or money on over priced food, over stressed out servers, for a place that does not care about quality. We assumed they microwaved the dish to warm it, but the manager told us they put it back under salamander warmer after telling us they have no microwave. That makes it so much better. That made the pasta on the palte edges all dried out. I can not believe a place of this so called stature would do this. Then they gave us two free cheeseckes to replace the bad food, and when they brought that out, the server did not bring out new silverware with it, we had to wait till he came back to ask for some, then he only brought out two, just for the people eating the cheese cake. Any restaurant I have been to, especially up scale restaurants, with large deserts, brings out fresh silverware and extra for people at the table to try. And it was not just our table, he did it to the table next to us, but at least he asked them, do you need new silverware? Do not keep spending money here people of Orland. I know Orland is desparate for good places, stick to Coopers Hawk on the other side of town for quality and good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orland-park?start=260,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148

Kinda dangerous though! I went for lunch on New Years day about 1130 and got sat right away. But I've seen the parking lot around this place since it opened and its always PACKED. I'll be back at an off time to enjoy some more. I tried something new this time and had the corn fritters for an appetizer. I was hoping it would be like White Fence Farm corn fritters, sadly no. They're ok I guess. Even when I went home and put some powdered sugar on them, they still didn't taste the same.

126,Lia Z.,"Hickory Hills, IL",0,46,,1.0,2013-01-10,"I agree with a previous comment, if you could give no stars, that would be more appropriate. Worst restaurant experience ever.. And I'm a server and have been for several years. Initially on walking in we weren't greeted, we were literally stared at for several minutes until we said ""table for 2"". We were told the wait was 40 minutes, but we waited for an hour and 20 minutes. When sat we waited 5 minutes to be greeted again. Our server never told us her name and mumbled off some specials and asked about drinks and appetizers. We ordered drinks and she began to run off and we had to get her attention to order appetizers. When she delivered our drinks and bread she ran off again. We didn't see her for 15 minutes. By that time our appetizer was placed down on the table next to us and then given to us by that table. And still we weren't checked on. When our server came back we ordered and had to ask for refills on empty glasses and for straws. In which our server placed the straws in our glasses with her bare hands in front of us. Then our entrees came out and were placed on the table to the right of us on the other side. Clearly we were at a phantom table of some sort. We were finally checked on after we were sitting ready for boxes for 15 minutes. By far the worst experience I've ever had in service. Not to mention our appetizer and my entree both came out cold. We didn't complain at the restaurant, but to say the least, WE WON'T BE BACK TO THIS LOCATION.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orland-park?start=260,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18
137,M G.,"Plainfield, IL",0,2,,2.0,2013-01-21,"I was so excited to try this place once it opened. Our wait time was 25 minutes on a Tuesday at 5pm, six weeks after it opened. There is open seating at the bar and at the 5 tables behind the bar....but not at the half booths in the same area. When I was in the bar area, I seen several open booths in the dining area. I asked the hostess if we could sit there. She said no...seemed like 20 minutes went by before someone was actually seated there. We were finally seated in last couple of booths-where it is opened to the mall. I was not a huge fan of practically being in the mall but was happy to finally be seated.  Our waiter and service was terrible. I asked how much the drinks were because they don't list drink prices on the menu. Our waiter had to go look and came back with an answer of $11.95. I did think that was a bit pricey but since my friend was getting a martini, I ordered one. Waiter comes back 15 minutes later with water and told my friend they are out of a liquor for her drink. (he called it whatever the stuff is that makes the drink ""skinny"")  Another 15 minutes and we finally had drinks. They were delicious!!   We placed our order once we received our drinks. Seeing as it took so long to just get our drinks...we didn't want to be there all night. I should also note that the menu is very long but I loved all the options. 45 minutes passed and a manager came to our table and muttered something to my friend. No ""hi, thank you for joining us or we are so sorry for the food delay..."" In fact I had no idea that he was the manager. He told her that her turkey burger was burnt so they were working on a new one. The food came another 20 minutes later. Huge portions and it tasted absolutely fantastic! We ended up ordering dessert to go. I also ordered a salad to go...super huge salad for pretty cheap, I think it was $6.   All and all the food and drinks were perfect. The service was terrible. When we finally got our credit cards back from paying the bill, we had been there 2 and a 1/2 hours. Our bill was about $65. My friend had a martini, turkey burger and slice of cheesecake to go. I had martini, chicken romano and a salad to go. I have heard from others that they had the same terrible service but the food was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orland-park?start=260,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002
198,Jazmin S.,"Joliet, IL",12,58,22.0,2.0,2013-01-22,"I was so excited for the cheesecake factory to open up closer to home since I've had such a wonderful experience at the Woodfield Mall location but all my hopes and dreams were shattered. I think the best way to rate my experience is 5 stars for the outstanding food and 0 stars for the service.  We arrived at 4:30 and were told that the wait was 1 hour.  Almost bolted but we came specifically to eat here and the kids were super excited so we decided to wait it out.   Since there was nothing else to do I started to watch the inside of the restaurant and noticed that there were many empty tables. It took a total of 3 bus boys to set up one table and I don't mean all at once, one at a time.  One to clear and clean, one to put plates and napkins, and the last one to place the silverware.  Each one was slow, and it took AT LEAST 10 minutes in between each busboy, ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME!!!!??? So if you do your math kids, that's a total of 30 minutes for 1 table to be set up.  Like I said, I had nothing better to do so I observed. Once our hour wait was up we were finally seated and our food was brought out at a reasonable time (the firecracker salmon and the grilled shrimp and bacon club were AMAZING!!) but then our waitress had disappeared.  Of course we were too full for cheesecake due to the HUGE portions but we decided to order a slice to go.  I counted an additional 30 minutes for the waitress to bring us boxes, get our cheesecake, get the check, pay and finally leave. So a quick bite turned into a 2 hour show. I have mixed feelings about my experience, the food was great but everything else involved with our experience down right sucked!  I think if I'm in the mood again for this restaurant, I'll drive all the way to woodfield instead.  Get your sh*t together Orland Park location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orland-park?start=180,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248

And I've visited plenty of different Cheesecake Factory restaurants before and have always been happy with both their food and their service. But I recommend everyone to stay away from the Orland location.  First the wait time is ridiculous. The hostess told us that the wait would be 45-50 minutes. We ended up waiting 1 hour and 30 minutes. When I asked the hostess why it was taking so long, she told me that my party had been assigned to a specific table but that the people who were seated there were taking longer to leave than they expected. This totally confuses me. This caused for diners who came in after us to get seated before us. Secondly, the set up of the restaurant is horrible. They ended up seating us at the tables that extended into the mall. It literally feels like you're eating at the food court. And Orland Mall is extremely busy. There are too many people walking by and staring at you eating. We didn't want to change the seating because we had already waited so long in the first place.  My friend had ordered the steak madeira and when it came she tasted it and immediately sent it back because it lacked seasoning. This is the meal she normally orders but this location failed to cook it correctly. She ordered buffalo wings as a replacement and we were told it would be out quickly. Her food did not come for another 30 minutes. We were all done eating at that point. We then requested to see the manager. We explained to him that we were dissatisfied with our experience and he argued with us about how none of our complaints were valid. He never apologized and then says that it is no fault of his or Cheesecake Factory that my friend didn't like her initial meal. I was appalled at his lack of customer service skills.

The first time was actually before they opened, and i don't feel like they can be judged on a trial run.  That being said, this second visit was a lot better than the first visit, but I still think they have a ways to go. You will see a common theme in these reviews, and it holds true. There is not enough seating! I took my mom here for lunch on a Tuesday just before noon.  We were told it would be a 30 minute wait, but it was more like 45-60, and that was only because we questioned the hostess on why people who had arrived after us were being seated before us.  She said it was because they were in larger parties and smaller tables were not available at that time. I would understand that, except that we had actually spoken to some people waiting next to us and they commented that they were shocked at the wait for a party of two. They had arrived well after us and were seated first. I'd hate to think of how long our wait would have been had we not asked on what the problem was. Our server was extremely friendly, and unfortunately I can't remember his name.  The wait to get our food was slower than most places, but I love their bread (I wish I knew what kind the brown one was!) and the conversation was good so I didn't notice so much.  When I did get my food, I had asked for no caramelized onions and my burger seemed to have an excess.  Whether or not that was an error with the server communicating to the kitchen, or kitchen error, I do not know. I just shoved them to the side and did not complain since we had been there for so long.  Other than that, the food was excellent. I ordered salad instead of the fries and it was delicious and fresh and was dressed perfectly.  My mom ordered soup, salad, and a half of a sandwich.  The half of sandwich was about the size of a full sandwich (on the small side) and the soup and salad was good size.  She would have been fine with just 2 of those options.  She said the sandwich and salad was great, but the soup was a little too think.  I agreed, but those could just be personal preferences as we are used to a different type of tortilla soup than she got. We split a piece of cheesecake for dessert and that was the reason we will come back to this location.  Tiramisu cheesecake!  I've tried many of the cheescakes that the cheesecake factory has to offer, but on a whim decided to give this a go.  Holy moly! It was better than any tiramisu I've had at any italian restaurant.  I could easily get addicted to that cheesecake. I honestly hope that some of the issues that were had at our second visit is still just some kinks getting worked out on a fairly recently opened restaurant, although I don't think the size can be fixed.  When I go back, it will definitely be for an earlier lunch or really early dinner, hopefully with smaller wait times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orland-park?start=260,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.0600000000000005,2.84
12,Anthony M.,"Chicago, IL",3575,1312,9475.0,4.0,2013-03-20,"BALLS OF CHEESE I think this is what we should call this place.  We arrived at this location, after driving in a car from downtown Chicago for 1.5 hours on a Friday afternoon, in the pouring rain.  So we needed a drink and we hit the bar here.  There was already a long wait for tables.  In fact, I had to work my way around everyone who was blocking the front door.  My goal was to secure a bar table for 5 people and I was lucky enough to grab the last one. As we were deciding what to drink, I noticed that there was a Happy Hour food special.  Apps were available in the bar for only $5 on Monday through Friday from 4 to 6pm.  We decided to grab an order of the Cheese and Spinach Dip with chips and an order of the Mac and Cheese Balls. The Mac and Cheese Balls were out of this world.  Leave it to Americans to create a ball of mac and cheese, bread it and then drop it in a deep fryer. These totally reminded me of an Italian Rice Ball. The Mac and Cheese Balls were also sitting in a creamy vodka red sauce.  Everything just worked. I hate to admit it but this might be the best thing I have ever had to eat at the Cheesecake Factory. I am not a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. I believe that there menu is too big and that causes them to make lots of different  food but not lots of good food.  They seem to be trying to make every customer happy. So I was surprised at how yummy this deep fried balls of cheese were. Maybe there goal was to finally make me happy! We also ordered the Cheese and Spinach Dip with chips.  It was kind of weird because it also came with a mini dish of salsa and a mini dish of sour cream. I guess they were there in case you did not like the spinach dip. I found the spinach to be very fresh. It seemed as if this dish might have been made from scratch.  I also noticed that there were some artichoke hearts in here but there was no mention of artichoke hearts in the menu. Great job Cheesy Cake...what if I was allergic to artichokes?  This dish was good but not as good as those balls of cheese. We also got a round of beer.  The prices were a little high considering we were in the burbs drinking in a shopping mall.  My 312 beer on tap cost $8, which was way over priced but after sitting in the car that long in stop and go traffic I needed something refreshing on a Friday afternoon. Our service was good.  The waitress was attentive and brought us all of our items in a timely manner. I was really surprised at our food. I thought I would never eat at a Cheesecake Factory ever again. When we arrived at the Mall there were not many choices that included alcohol, so I kind of picked this place based on the fact that there were drinks here. Thanks Cheesecake Factory for stepping up and showing us a really nice evening.  And I will be back for your Deep Fried Cheese Balls.

The food was awesome and the service was pretty good, I made sure that I went around 2 p.m. on a weekday and it wasn't so bad. I don't think there is anything that can be done about the wait so the choice is always up to the customer, if they can wait it out to eat then fine, but if they can't wait it's better to find another place and don't complain about the wait because there will always be one at the Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orland-park?start=240,2.68,2.68,2.68,1.9320000000000002,2.68

We were seated, given menus and waited for our server. About 10-15 minutes later, the server introduced herself (Tracy--Traci sp??) took our drink orders and said she'll be right back. She returned 10 minutes later to get our appetizer/entree order without bringing us ice water or bread. She reassured us that our drinks will be served shortly. Another 20-25 minutes passed......NO WATER, NO BREAD, NO DRINKS, NO APPETIZERS!! She came back to our table and reassured us AGAIN, your bread and drinks will be here shortly but we ran out of buffalo wings and the macaroni cheese balls and a few more things she added. WOW! Then asked, are you ready to place your order. Are you serious lady? We haven't received water, no bread, no appetizers or drinks ordered, you're out of half the things we've asked for, really..... and you seriously want to take ANOTHER order from us!! I tried my best to have patience since we (me, husband and son) hadn't eaten since earlier that day. I understand its the weekend but come on. I expect the waiting time to be seated would be long, NOT the waiting time to be served some ice water and bread at least! If you're understaffed as I read this in other comments, then I suggest they hire more people or shut this place down and let another food chain take over that could handle a crowd. If you choose to eat at this place, don't go when you're starving because the service is brutally SLOW! We walked out with nothing in our stomachs and it was 8:00pm by then! Oh boy was I not  only starving but pissed that we wasted so much time. I'd rather keep going to the downtown location until I hear more positive reviews about the Orland location. They need a lot of help. Please iron out the kinks and managers need to do better with the inventory. How can you run out of your most popular foods? Unbelievable! Almost 2 hours wasted of my life that I'll never get back. We went elsewhere to eat and was very satisfied before the night ended, no thanks to the Cheesecake Factory.

Upon pick-up, which we had come late to, they said the cake was ready, but has to be written on.  So we waited about half an hour!  Pre-ordering is pointless! When the cake was finished and they showed it to us the plaque looked like a kid took a Hershey bar and wrote on it with some glue.  We decided not to include the cancer symbol to make room for the text, but that didn't matter.  The text was in 12 pt font crammed to the top of the plaque with a tiny smiley face in the middle of the bar.  By the time we got home, our house is literally less than 10 minutes away, the chocolate writing had separated and now says ""Ycu dill il! :)""  Awesome.

275,Tynee C.,"Chicago, IL",0,49,7.0,1.0,2013-06-16,"I really like the Cheesecake Factory.  I've been going for over a decade.  I've been to the locations at the John Hancock Center in Chicago and to another just outside of the Milwaukee area.  But this one in Orland Park needs some help . . . maybe a visit from Gordon Ramsey.  I went here for my graduation on June 15th and my son treated me to dinner. There were four of us so me and my best friend went in to do the 50 minute wait while my son and her son waited in the car.  We actually got a seat sooner after about 15 minutes in the bar area and I was thrilled.  Unfortunately, that would be my only thrill for the night.  Our waitress must have had some type of hearing impairment because she wasn't hearing anything we said. Here are the problems I had with this location: She set up water for two when we told her we were waiting for two more people to join us.  We got two more glasses of water and she then asked if we wanted two more straws which should have been automatic. We were given only two servings of bread and had to ask for more.  Why would you not want to give us bread since we have to wait so long for the food? Napkins.  I know the economy hasn't been the greatest, but why do we have to keep asking for napkins? It took about 30 minutes before we got our food and when we did it was only two of four meals, then about 5 minutes later one more meal.   The graduate . . . well I waited and waited and waited . . . and my party did not want to begin eating until I got my food.  I never did.  Finally the waitress comes out to tell me that the cook prepared a half order for me and it should have been a full order so I have to wait until he prepares it again.  By this time, I'm angry and told my party to go ahead and eat their food before it gets cold.  I went outside to collect my thoughts.  I came back and still no food.  Finally, I told my son to tell whoever brings my food that I don't want it unless it's free, and he did.  They didn't charge him for the meal but it wasn't even hot.  It was lukewarm at best. Then there was a breakdown in communication.  The manager comes over and offers me a nice slice of cheesecake for my troubles and we had to tell him that my meal had been comped due to the delay.   'Any who' . . . I still like the Cheesecake Factory but I just won't be going to the one in Orland Park. Oh wait a minute!  There's more. We specifically asked to have the checks split but she included everything on one check so she had to fix that.  Then I asked for a container for my food but the server came back she took my girlfriend's plate and boxed her leftovers so I had to ask her again because I preferred to box my own food. If you get aggravated when you're hungry and people are jacking around with your food, please do not go to this location.  Their service stinks to high hell and the food is not served hot.

93,Joe A.,"Chicago Heights, IL",1,20,,1.0,2013-08-31,"I'm giving Cheesecake Factory a one-star because I know their food and their concept are better than this ""operation"" they have going in Orland Park.  Calabasas.. you need to get into this store and fix it, ASAP. First, the people on here knocking the food don't know what they're talking about.  The food at the Cheesecake Factory is better than most places in the area.  The Cuban Sandwich, Louisiana Pasta.. it's always good every time I go. Here goes... I'm tired of waiting 25 minutes for a burger and 24 minutes for a freaking appetizer.  This was my experience in consecutive visits. In the first visit, when I brought up that I had been waiting for 20 minutes for my burger, the latino gentleman bartending actually argued with me!  ""It's only been 16 minutes sir.""  Guess what?  It says what time the order was entered into the computer on the check!  It was sitting right there in front of me. This time, I am sitting there hungry yesterday waiting on a tex mex egg roll.  I'm reading something on my phone when I realize it's been 20 minutes.  I kind of look at the bartender as if to say, ""really.""   PAUSE!  SHE should not be waiting 20 minutes for someone to get an appetizer out.  I've worked in restaurants, even as the manager of a PF Changs.  When a ticket time on an appetizer reaches 8 minutes, there should be a sense of urgency.  By the way, this place was far from packed, so it's not like the kitchen was popped.  This is not a bartender issue to me... it's an expo issue.  Someone should have been in that window after ten minutes wondering what the heck was going on with my appetizer. So, to Kathy's credit (I think that was her name), she actually asked someone to go check on it.  I'm not a big fan of corporate restaurants making me feel like it's the bartenders problem .. like it's her responsibility to tend bar AND get appetizers out of the window in less than 24 minutes.  That's when it's time for a manager to be DOING SOMETHING.. not just walking around chatting with employees.  More on that later... So, I'm not arguing with bartenders anymore.  I took the ticket right to the front desk and asked for a manager.  At this point I was irate, because of the last visit and this visit.  When the blonde girl asked me a question after she told me she was getting a manager, I looked right past her because I didn't want to lose it.. she stares at me for a few seconds and then gives this whatever sigh. The manager comes up and I give him the ticket and say, ""here, I've been waiting on this for 23 minutes.""  Not my responsibility to have this protracted conversation with the guy.  I gave him the essential info.  This taller, white, blondish, possibly red-haired balding guy replies, ""what is it?""  Seriously?  I just handed you a ticket with two food items on them.  What else could it be?  How about, those two items?  So I walk back and sit down and my food actually was there. The bartenders were nice and really, really attentive after that.  They kinda realized I was beyond pissed.  Look, I worked at a Cheesecake in grad school in San Jose, CA.  We rocked the house.  We had to work so fast that at the end of your shift you felt like your head was gonna fall off.  I lost 60 lbs. that summer running my rear end off.  So, I have no tolerance for appetizers that take 2.5 times as long as they should take MAX.  Especially since even with happy hour prices, a coke, fries and tex mex egg rolls was $17 after tip (I did leave $4). The manager never came by.  He never went to the kitchen, asked what was up, and then came back to the bar to say ""hey, sorry about that.""  Had he come by, said sorry, and maybe taken one thing off the bill, I still would have been mad.  Even if he took nothing off the bill (which is really just the only way a restaurant can SHOW they're sorry about bad service), but seemed to be genuinely handling it, great.  But all he was interested in doing was chilling in between the kitchen and host stand. I spent $50 a month here at least and encouraged people to go.  Now, not only will I do neither (of course I'm going to go to Cheesecake Factory, but OTHER LOCATIONS), I will actively go out of my WAY to make sure that if anyone I know goes here, they are forewarned. Calabasas... get out here and do something.  The opening of this place has been an unmitigated disaster for CF's normally high standards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orland-park?start=160,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.212,2.32

139,J C.,"Homer Glen, IL",0,9,8.0,1.0,2013-10-09,"We decided to try this Cheesecake Factory since it is recent to Orland Park and it was my birthday. Other Cheesecake restaurants in the Chicago area (downtown and Oak Brook) are spectacular, but this one pales in comparison. There was a wait, even at 5:30 pm, but I expected that. Then, they tried to seat our party of 5 in a small both for 4 and they would ""pull up a chair"" for my son. He's 6 foot 5 inches tall! We were all adults, not children in high chairs. When I expressed my concern, the hostess told me she was sorry, but that is the table they were offering us, and if we didn't want to sit there, we would have to go back and sit and wait. My husband told me to drop it, and we sat down. Let me just add that this restaurant is VERY narrow, and the aisle my son was sitting in was the main walkway to the kitchen. The walkways are barely wide enough for two people to pass by, and him sitting there was not a good plan. Didn't they know we had said 5? Yes, they knew. About 10 minutes after we had been sat, the hostess came and said she was embarrassed, and moved us to a larger booth, very suited for 6 adults. Perfect. But then the new server and our previous server needed to have a discussion about who would serve us. Our previous waitress apparently won. She was not the most friendly...in fact, it took quite a bit of work on our part to get her to smile, then speak to us in a friendly manner. BUT, we knew this was a Cheesecake Factory, so the food was going to be awesome, right? Nope. Food came out and it wasn't hot, the portions were not up to the portions at other CCFs, my husband's steak Dianne was overcooked, and the food was bland bland bland. We are not into spicy or hot food, but, we are into food with flavor. Nobody finished their meal out of lack of enthusiasm. Our crab & cheese appetizer was the best part, but it didn't have enough pieces of bread. I mentioned it to the waitress and she just sort of shrugged. Really? We did order a couple slices of cheesecake. They were average size and not fresh. I get better cheesecake at other restaurants a couple doors down from this place. Overall, we will not be back. It's a shame. We were hoping our new, nearby Cheesecake Factory restaurant in Orland Park would mean we wouldn't have to hike out to Oak Brook for special occasions. Nope! Well, at least Uncle Julio's just opened this week!! Maybe their new location will fair better than Cheesecake factory.

Mom: ""Please go ahead and eat before your burger gets cold."" BF: ""No, no I can wait. It is not a problem."" About fifteen minutes later, mom and my sandwiches arrive. By this point, boyfriend's burger is ice cold. The waitress feels pretty bad so she sends over a manager. . The manager comes over as boyfriend is almost done eating his cold burger. He offers to replace the sandwich but boyfriend is a fast eater so it was almost gone. Manager explained to us (and this is where it got confusing) that for some reason, they brought out boyfriend's sandwich but decided to remake mine and mom's.

He gave us 10 instead.  Once order was placed, it took over 30 minutes to get our food. Wait staff was not attentive at refills and keeping our table clean.  Overall service was a C- at best.   Time to send staff to hospitality and professional appearance training.  Or, at least send them to the Oak Brook location, where they could pick up a few pointers.  Maybe the kitchen was understaffed too?  Food was good, but not worth quality of service and the wait.   I was expecting much better from this chain.   Will not be recommending this place to anyone anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orland-park?start=260,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.3120000000000003,3.0000000000000004

Apparently their server, which was also ours, went on a break.  It took about 15 minutes for anyone to even notice us. We got water, and no bread.

My bf ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich, they messed up and gave him a chipotle one. We told our server about the mix up and the manager came and apologized.

Second visit, the grilled salmon lunch portion was a major hit.  Fresh, lightly seasoned salmon, with wild rice and broccoli.  The Caesar salad as an accompaniment was lacking; Romaine lettuce with a minimal Parmesan and a scattering of croutons, with a small amount of somewhat generic dressing.  This time we had a shared piece of banana cream cheesecake.  Good, but not as good as the red velvet.  The biggest issue here is the service.  There seems to be a good deal of disconnect between the wait staff/food runners/kitchen.  First visit, we had a hard time getting someone to clear the plates from the tiny table we were seated at.  Second visit, the runner brought a regular salad out instead of a Caesar, and disappeared before I had time to notice the error.  It took about fifteen minutes for our server to our come around to correct the salad mistake.   Prices here are a bit steep, but for the most part, the food quality matches up.  What may lack in service is made up for in cheesecake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orland-park?start=120,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.352,2.84

So, My husband chicken bellagio arrived yet there was a 10 min wait on my shrimp scampi because the order was mixed up. So we waited......

I showed my husband we quickly stopped the next waiter we saw to call for a manager. When she came, she asked for the piece of sharp object and took it under the light near the kitchen.  It was a piece of porcelain plate that broke off into my food. WOW! I was so upset. The thought that I could have swallowed a piece of plate with sharp edges. After the manager acknowledged this huge mistake she told us what it was and then left to advise the waiter to tell us our food order would be taken care of. I was pretty upset to say the least.

I been here 2 in my life i would never recommend this to anybody last time i ever come the people who like coming here are the people who think red lobster is a gormea restaurant. With the money u pay here u could easily go to one of the best restaurants in Chicago. Regarding the food this is the type of restaurant that is quantity over quality. They give u huge portions to justify the food tasting bad. Lol the calamari were so salty couldnt eat more then 1. The spinach dip jus didnt taste good it was way to watery so frozen spinach? And didnt have no seasoning very bland.  Chicken and biscuits. Lol gravy wasnt bad wasnt good it needed more though cause chicken was dry the biscuits were so dry when u ate it with the gravy it was pasty. Regarding there famous cheese cakes i tried many different types dont like any of them there way to sweet like one bite and u can feel like ur getting diabetes. I just dont think there made that good in general way to expensive too for just a lil slice. Regarding service its a joke. Like no refills? No utencils?

I don't believe in sending almost anything back.  Generally I never go back to the establishment.      My wife ordered the Chicken Madeira with mashed potatoes.  Unfortunately the chicken was undercooked with strings of fat visible through the sauce.  She sent the dish back.  The waitress and management were very concerned and offered multiple alternatives including the same dish.  The second plate of Madeira came back cooked as it should be.  It was very good.  Management paid for this dish.       As the management and staff were so good, our visit was saved from being unacceptable and the two of us walking away full and relatively happy.  We'll go back for another try.  Stay tuned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orland-park?start=140,2.64,2.68,2.68,2.572,2.664

We approached the desk to see how long the wait was and it was pretty close to 45 minutes. When we visited the location in Orland park, it was the same story. Not knowing that seating is available in the bar area, WITHOUT A WAIT AND WHEN A TABLE IS VACANT we thought for sure that we would be looking at the 45 minute wait time. A manger stepped us to us and asked if we would mind sitting in the bar, NO SIR we said and with that we were seated with many people wondering why  we were so lucky to get a table in the bar. Now you know, no waiting for bar seating. The food is very good, huge plates, the many different desserts are to die for. I have had many types of their cheese cake, delish.

A man introduced himself and took our order but explained that he was not our waiter, he was filling in while our waitress was on break. We ordered Spinach Dip to start. It was good but served with tortilla chips and a side of salsa. Every table gets bread and butter but they ran out when we got there.  Food: We ordered Garlic Noodles, Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos, and Baja Chicken Tacos.  One server came out with the Noodles after about 15 minutes. A different server came out with the Chicken Lettuce Wraps about 5 minutes later and said she would be right back with my Chicken Tacos. She never came back. Our waitress came back to give us refills then left. About 10 minutes later she came and asked if I was still waiting for my food. The other two people were almost done eating and I said yes. She apologized and said she will talk to the manager and chef to make this right. She came back a few minutes later (30 minutes after the Garlic noodles came out) with my tacos but didn't give any explanation. The tacos were good but not spicy or hot (fresh) and tasted like they were sitting under a hot lamp for awhile. The side of beans and rice were both inedible. The black beans were hard and under cooked while the rice was cooked well but flavorless. Maybe I was supposed to mix them or add it to my tacos? I was glad that my chicken was good because the Lettuce Wraps each came with one little piece of overcooked chicken, hard and dry. The Garlic Noodles were good and we decided to stay for cheesecake.  We tried the Fresh Banana Cream & Red Velvet Cheesecakes. The banana cream had a good flavor but was frozen in the middle. The red velvet cheesecake was good. The total was a little over $70 for the 3 of us to eat. The food is on par with Chilis or Applebees but twice the price.

Outside of bragging that she was able to convince a cook to make a crabcake sandwich (I think that's something I took antibiotics for in high school?) I often worried that I needed to check her pulse to make sure she was alive. The food delivered, as always. Nothing to rave about, and entirely to expensive, but good nonetheless. The crown jewel here was a strawberry shortcake we rolled the dice on, that was delivered by a relief waitress while ours was on break (or perhaps she passed away?).

Overtime the shrimp and chicken dwindled in size and quantity and even flavor which has lead me to try new things there. Everything I tried has been somewhere between mediocre and crap. Last night I had Jamaican shrimp and chicken  with enough rice to feed to a small village and a small serving of small shrimp and chicken. The presentation was nothing impressive. My boyfriend had the steak n potatoes and the steak was low quality also. Even my slice of fudge cake was dissapointig which I had before and remember it being amazing. Another thing taking from my experience is the crowd of people going there.

Every time we've come here, it's uncomfortably crowded (they try to squeeze as many people in there as possible), wait times are ridiculous (there's times it was up two a two hour wait and I nope'd right out of there). Service and food is very inconsistent and servers look annoyed and tired (I don't blame them, this location is a zoo). This was a horrible spot for the Cheesecake Factory to settle in Orland Park. They had little space to work with when moving into a bottom floor of a mall, and it shows.  The only time we enjoyed this location is when we were able to sit outside in the fall under heaters, away from shoulder to shoulder contact and having all sorts of people in my personal bubble. You know, outside, where we could actually breathe. If you want to give Cheesecake Factory a try, please do not let this location turn you off. The locations in Oak Brook and Downtown are much, MUCH better. We do ourselves the favor and drive farther to enjoy their food.

17,Stacey F.,"Kankakee, IL",0,16,1.0,2.0,2016-06-16,"Yesterday was my mother's birthday so I decided to treat her to a birthday dinner anywhere of her choice. She chose The Cheesecake Factory in Orland. We arrived after a 45 minute drive and the restaurant was unusually empty. We were seated immediately and as soon as we learned who our waiter would be, I informed him that it was my mother's birthday. And he acknowledged my statement with a smile and wink (never telling my mom ""Happy Birthday."" As an appetizer, we ordered the spinach artichoke dip. The chips were nice and warm but the dip was cold and tasted awful. My mother and I ordered the Shrimp Scampi and my son had Pepperoni Pizza from the kid's menu. To say we were disappointed was an understatement. Our waiter seemed to be completely apathetic and disconnected from the experience. Our Scampi arrived and the shrimp was burned and the pasta was totally bland. No amount of salt and pepper could save that pasta. Again, our waiter couldn't care less. On a positive note, my son's pizza was really good and so were our strawberry lemonades. We each ordered a slice of cheesecake to go (that was sliced unusually thin to be $7), however it ended up being delicious. I've been to TCF several times where a birthday was being celebrated. They're usually given a slice of Original Cheesecake and ""Happy Birthday"" is written on the plate. My mom didn't get that. She got a bowl of whipped cream with a candle on top! Are you kidding me?  Not only that, the waiter brought out the bowl of whipped cream AFTER I paid our $100 bill. So I literally got a bowl of whipped cream with my receipt. My mother deserved so much better than this. On the ride home the conversation was about how awful the food was. Not at all how my mom's birthday should have been remembered.  I will not be back to this location and TCF is no longer on my list of favorite restaurants. I feel like I still owe my mother a birthday dinner.  ***update***I received a phone call from the manager who was very pleasant and genuinely seemed interested  in offering me a better experience on my next visit. I never planned to step foot in this location again but I am now excited to give them another try.

I come here all the time and there's always something wrong. Our waiters almost never pay enough attention or somehow our order is wrong. There's been times I had to ask 3 different staff for something until I finally get it because my waiter never comes around.  The food here is so expensive!

I must say it is the worst experience I've had so far and I love the Cheesecake Factory. We were seated in the booth area seats, and there was a gentleman sitting in a chair right in the middle of the aisle so of course people had to go around him which meant they were bumping into our table. Of course we complained to our waitress and she said that we weren't the only people complaining so I don't understand why the manager wouldn't come out and have the gentleman either sit in the booth or sit his party somewhere else. We were ready to start our meal off with appetizers and unfortunately all of the favorite ones that I like that I suggested to my fiance they were out of. The one we finally chose was a good, but still it's not what we really wanted. Then on to dinner, all of the choices that I asked for they were out of, So once again I had to settle for something else but thankfully it was good. Then we had to listen to employees arguing as they're walking down the aisle, then other employees playing behind the cheesecake display, not to mention the fact that when you got up to go to the bathroom you literally slid all the way there because the floors was so slippery. Not one time did we see a manager walking around and we were there for almost 3 hours. Of course I sent an email letting the company know about my experience, that was on Monday morning still haven't heard anything ,no apology no phone calls from any managers, nothing.

Okay so here it is. I like this place, honestly. Okay lets start with the staff. The staff is really friendly, the waitress we had, although I forgot her name, she was really nice and she knew exactly what she was doing. She had perfect timing, and she didn't do the 'I'm gonna rush you out' thing which is always a great thing to not have. Next we will talk about the wait time. So we went in during the busy hours of the business. So the wait was about 40 minutes, as this location is one of the popular restaurants in the area. So please don't be disappointed if there is a tiny wait for your visit. So now let's talk about the superstar of this place, the food. So I had the steak with mashed potatoes and green beans. The steak was perfectly seasoned to taste, and was really tender and it was a really great portion. The mashed potatoes are to die for. They were like the best mashed potatoes I ever had. The green beans were a nice green touch to the plate and were firm and cooked the way I like them. Now on to the Cheesecake, I had the Smores cheesecake and holy crap, it was like cake and icecream had a baby and it was cheesecake. It was super rich with flavor and I was sad when it was gone. Well here you have it my Cheesecake Factory review, Hope this helped",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orland-park?start=80,2.64,2.63,2.63,2.6399999999999997,2.6340000000000003

The hand dryer was a dark hole, so scary! We ordered drinks while we looked at the menu , coffee for me raspberry lemonade for my sugar loving kid. Coffee was ok, I could feel debris from the dishwasher on the outside of the cup, I'm a stickler for details. Finally our food comes almost burned my arm on the plates but no problem, I ordered a good size hamburger and fries that were perfectly ""hot"" and crisp, they forgot mustard but I never asked so my bad ! My hamburger was awesome, cooked med, tasted scrumptious the sides of pickle and lettuce tasted funny but the grilled onion was incredible, if I just had the mustard which came eventually, along with extra ketchup for my perfect fries! My daughter ordered the fettuccine Alfredo, too salty for me but she liked it.

It's busy on the weekends, but the mall location is great to walk around in the interim. The wait is 1 hour average. Its worth the wait. Once seated a waitress greeted us immediately. She got our drink order and asked if we wanted an appetizer. Our bread was served warm with our drinks. I ordered the egg roll appetizer. It was perfect. My husband and I ordered Kobe Burger, and Chicken Picatta. Both cooked perfectly and were received immediately upon finishing our appetizer. My husband commented he wanted a burger, but received the Best Burger ever. For the restaurant being as busy as it was I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly the chefs created our orders so well. Finally we ordered Nutella hazelnut cheesecake and that of course was icing on the cake. Too good. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. Very clean environment and pleasant customer service.

The hostess proceeded to have us seated at a tiny table in the bar area between 2 other occupied table which would have put us shoulder to shoulder with our neighbors. I noticed at least 30+ empty booth throughout the restaurant when we walked in. I politely asked her if we could get a booth and with a bit of an attitude she brought us to the only one that needed to be cleaned off so we had to wait a bit for it. Nice welcome!  My wife ordered the half sandwich/soup/salad ($12.95) and asked what the soup choices were. Our server (who was very nice) told her that the only soup was clam chowder. We have never been to a restaurant that didn't have at least 2-3 choices of soup on the menu. Since she doesn't like clam chowder, she substituted fries. Needless to say, fries don't take the place of soup. I ordered the Cuban sandwich ($13.95) which was OK. It was cut in half and only one half had ham on it. We also had to wait almost an hour for our food. I asked our server what was going on with our order and he said they ran out of bread used for a Cuban so they had to send someone out for it. He then stated that my wife's sandwich and our fries were done so it only should be a few more minutes. It was about 15 and the fries were cold and like rubber. We each had 2 beers, she had  Bud Light ($5.75) and I had a Stella ($6.50) outrageous! We bought a sliver of cheesecake to go (they are not large pieces) for $8. If the food was decent I might not complain about the outrageous prices but this place will not see us return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orland-park?start=100,2.68,2.63,2.63,2.148,2.6500000000000004

This particular location I don't like the bar area. It's super loud and can't talk at all so if you're looking for a quiet place to talk, stay away from the bar area. The hostess service is ok. Not very friendly every time but the waitress and waiters are always fantastic! Food is always great at this location and cheesecake is always good here as well. But if you're picking up cheesecake, that area is not friendly either. So I guess food and waiter and waitress is awesome. Front desk and cheesecake area not.

Sent them back and when the second order came, they were still hard in the middle and cold! The server was amazing and was very understanding and the manager even asked me if I wanted another entree.

We saw him maybe 2x.  Every element of our meal was served by another staff ranging from the manager to the bus person. Actually, the bus person was the nicest and most attentive.  The woman's bathroom was disgusting.  There was tissue all over the floors and urine all over the toilet. We never once got asked if we needed additional drinks.  Each and every person at the table including my 3&5 year old had glasses of ice and not one person offered to refill our drinks.  The part that took the cake was when my son ordered onion rings and found a shrimp in them.  He is deathly allergic to shrimp!!! The manager brought us another batch of onion rings, but obviously the onion rings are either prepared with the shrimp or in close proximity.  So another offer of onion rings was a slap in the face.  My experience was so awful we didn't even get to get cake which is why we came in the first place.

Everything was fresh, the pasta napole was delish, my dad enjoyed his jambalaya while, my grandma fished her way through the Louisiana pasta.  So, my only complaints are add more seasoning to the catfish and wash the salad greens thoroughly because the salads taste like unwashed, bitter collard greens.   Other than that, we were all stuffed and pleased with the food and the mouth watering cheese cakes. And I don't even like cheesecake. But ordering the Reese Chocolate cake chessecake is a must!!!

Anyway, our cheesecakes came out and BOTH of our plates had this weird grimy stuff on them, as if the plates were not clean all the way!? Yuck! On top of which I had some type of black crumble on my whipped cream (the waitress either lied or was completely oblivious and said it was from them cutting the fresh banana but lol I've cut many bananas in my day, I've never seen that sort of substance coming from a banana) I guessed it was crust from another cheesecake that somehow made its way to my plate, which is extremely tacky and not a good presentation at all. Well the waitress got me another plate but literally scrapped the cheesecake and the whipped cream onto another clean plate so I was left with a TERRIBLE presentation, just a big blob of mess on my plate, whip cream and banana all over the place on the plate, was the tackiest experience I think I've ever had at a restaurant in my life.

My boyfriend ordered the spicy cashew chicken with no cashews with white rice & extra sauce on it & on the side. Food arrived. The macaroni & cheese was a bowl of noodles with cheese sauce @ the bottom of the bowl, it used to be a square black dish with noodles & lots of cheese & breadcrumbs baked on top. Then my dish was correct for the most park except for extra sauce being on it & hardly any sauce on the side. Then the spicy cashew dish had hardly any sauce on it, we requested more & she brought out sauce that looked like a clear soy sauce for it. As we asked for more because the following one before that was incorrect she said it takes 5 minutes to cook more. As we waited he went to eat more anyways and noticed a gnat crawl out of his food.

I work in healthcare and that was completely unacceptable. Do you know how many diseases are passed due to poor hygiene?!?! One of the women left to find someone to bring more toilet paper, soap, and to say the restroom needs to be tended to, still waiting. A supervisor then comes in, no soap just to refill the toilet paper rolls in each stall. We all state that we cannot leave the restroom without washing our hands. She proceeds to say they have been out of soap all day, and that the manager went upstairs to bath and body works to buy soap. Gross #5, OUT OF SOAP ALL DAY AND YOU KNEW AND DID NOTHING ABOUT IT, DISGUSTING! I then ask her if the kitchen has soap, she says yes they have soap. I asked if she can bring some of that soap for us to use. She said yes and brought soap from the employee restroom. I wash my hands  thoroughly and leave the restroom.  I get back to the table to find that my boyfriend has been waiting for me to come back for almost 30 minutes. We finally get to order our food, waiters change during this time. 30 minutes later we get our appetizer from another waiter, without the second waiter checking on us once. (first waiter was wonderful but had to move to bartender because of being short staffed) 40 minutes into us sitting at our table the new waiter in passing asks if we ever received bread, we say yes she says okay and never comes back. Once done with the appetizer we wait another 20 minutes for our entree. In total it took 50 minutes for our entree to come out, and my food was luke warm as in it's probably been sitting somewhere for sometime. I ordered the lemon chicken with garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli. At this point when the waiter finally checks on us she goes, ""Oh I see your food finally came out."" I barely ate my food and the waiter noticed asking if I wanted a box, I said no can we please have the check and a manager please. A gentlemen comes to the table a short while later, I explain everything that has gone on since arriving explaining that these things are unacceptable and is a health hazard for those dining in the restaurant, not to mention the Narovirius is going around fast.  The manager made no excuses, he stated he agree with everything I said and informed me that a pipe burst upstairs which cut the water supply/ soap pumps run off of the water supply; explaining the issue with the water pressure when finally washing my hands. He comp'd my meal/Coca Cola and for the trouble of waiting he offered us free cheesecake. I suggested that other patrons should be notified that the restrooms were out of comission to some extent, it's only right. They did end up placing signs on the door explaining the issue and for patron's to use the restrooms in the mall. I'm still horrified about the cleanliness of the restroom and not having soap. I probably won't be eating here anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orland-park,2.6,2.6,2.612,,2.6

247,Brian B.,"Homer Glen, IL",1,10,,1.0,2018-01-05,Extremely dirty and service slow. They wiped off table but left pieces of silverware on floor. Staff does not work as a team everyone is working on there own. Took forever to get food and drinks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orland-park,2.48,2.56,2.608,,2.528
