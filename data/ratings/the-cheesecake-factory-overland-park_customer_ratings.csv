It was tough to choose when all the choices are half price.....so I had Sara D. help me cause, I figured she eats here more than I. I expected a huge long line, but we were seated promptly. I've never ordered anything but cheesecake in one of these. Granted, I asked if the cheesecake is actually made there or delivered frozen.  It is delivered frozen, from I don't know where. I think it's way too expensive at full price, but have no complaints about half price. I had a raspberry white chocolate truffle cheesecake. It had sprinkles of shaved white chocolate on top of the cheesecake. I was expecting raspberries, but it had some kind of pureed raspberries instead. It had a chocolate crust with 2 huge dollops of whipped cream.  The taste was classic Cheesecake Factory.

The first time I came to KC and was going to go it was so packed the line was outside and it was going to take 45mins to seat 11 people.  We had 3 kids under 3 years old and couldn't wait that long.  My boyfriend and I came to KC for fun and we had to try it again. I am so glad we did. I didn't realize they had all kinds of food. From Italian, pizza, hamburgers, steaks, salads....almost everything. It took us a long time to decide because it all sounded good.  The staff was so nice and our waitress helped explain what was a top favorite.  Highly recommend. I got the fried shrimp with fries and slaw and a side of Mac and cheese.

I've never had a bad experience with any of the dishes I have ordered at the Cheesecake Factory.  My family and I made a weekend trip to Kansas City and we came here. We knew we wanted to come here, since we use to live in CA near a few cheesecake factories and then moved to AR with no cheesecake factories. We were really excited to come eat! WAIT/PARKING: We came on a Saturday evening around 6ish. It was really crowded, but we didn't have too long of a wait fortunately. About 30 minutes.  The restaurant is located in a small shopping center. There is a decent amount of parking, but it is a busy restaurant, so parking can be hard to find. We had to park near Whole Foods, which is in the back of cheesecake - not far. CUSTOMER SERVICE: Our waiter gave us great customer service. Very friendly and helpful. FOOD: I've ordered quite a few dishes at Cheesecake Factory. Lately, I've mainly been ordering off of the skinnylicious menu. Can't beat yummy and healthy! I've had several items off of this menu and they have all been delicious and filling. This trip I ordered the Asian Chicken Salad. So yummy, ate it all! It was a large portion too. Which, btw, all of cheesecake factory dishes are good size portions. Usually you will have left overs.  My husband ordered the Italian Sandwich and loved it.  We had our 2 year old daughter with us. At all restaurant locations they bring out a smaller plate of fruit and bread to you if you have a small child. Not sure whicha age is the cut off for that. It is such a nice gesture and I appreciate them taking that extra step to treat the kids good and help the parents out ;). Then we ordered cheesecake... I mean c'mon, how can you pass it up when dining here! I've had a good amount of cheesecakes here and they are all yummy. This time I ordered the Hershey's Cheesecake - oh my yum! My husband had the Reese's Peanut Buttercup Chocolate Cheesecake- also very delicious. We had leftovers from our cheesecakes. Very delicious, but both rich that we weren't able to finish them. However, I finished mine later for my ""4th"" meal haha.  Other cheesecakes I love: fresh strawberry, s'more, 30th anniversary, godiva, raspberry, peanut butter cup fudge, and chocolate mousse.

While we initially both ordered burgers, I decided to throw a curveball and order the Fettuccine Alfredo, and the server never missed a beat. When we received our order - completely pleased. For a cold, gray and just genuinely dreary day my meal hit the spot and warmed me up. My wife was pleased with her burger, but stopped early because she wanted a slice of cheesecake. She has a better beat on her priorities than I do since... duh, ""Cheesecake Factory"". I decided to slow down from that point as well. The desserts, of course, you can't lose with. She had a Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake while I had the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake.  Not the cheapest lunch ever, but you actually get great portion sizes for the dollar.

O.,"Overland Park, KS",80,174,296.0,3.0,2016-02-12,"Being from a small(er) town, I recall my early experiences with Cheesecake Factory being a BIG DEAL.  When my wife (then-girlfriend) moved to Kansas City from the aforementioned village, nearly every big experience was celebrated with a dinner date out to the Cheesecake Factory on the Country Club Plaza in The Big City.  We gladly suffered through three-hour-and-thirty-minute waits on Saturday night, just to be ""on the Plaza"" and seemingly more awesome than all the pitiful fools we left behind from our misspent (mis-located?) youth. The basics haven't changed in 10 years - nice, clean venues, consistent decor, strong service, enormous menu covering cuisine from all seven continents, and, yes, hunger-pain-inducing long waits on the weekends. My last three visits have all been relatively more of the same, with the exception that each one missed a step in one of the above areas.  On the former two occasions, the food quality had seemingly dropped off a tick. For a decade, I would have rated it 4/5 stars, but it's dropped to 3 - 3.5.  Still strong, especially considering the breadth of menu options the obviously-skilled CF chefs have to be able to create, but down a notch.  Quantity is still enormous, which is to say just fine. On my latest visit, I feel we were slighted on the usual above-average service end of things.  Our waitress was a little more in tune to the pompadour-haired bartender than her waiting duties, both on our table and others'.  You may be thinking, ""But, M.O., you yourself pointed out just how crazy-busy the Cheesecake Factory is!""  Yes, Yelp brethren, while this is normally true, on this occasion it was a mid-winter Thursday evening from 9:00 to 11:00 pm in the bar.  We were but one of three spots in the entire bar area taking up space.  So few tables to tend to should have meant better-than-average service, however we received the opposite.  Nitpicks aside, Cheesecake Factory remains a strong, albeit predictable, choice for a good meal alongside half the metropolitan area.   TIP: Get the cheesecake. Any of them. Obvious, yes, but almost so much so that you might be tempted to eat that entire 14-pound plate of delicious pasta instead of leaving room for dessert.  There's a reason the dessert name made the façade, folks!

I've found that all the pastas, have had them all, are fantastic. My favorite pasta is the Carbonara and Da Vinci.  If you're feeling adventurous, you can have your dessert before your meal. As you walk into the place, they have their cheesecake bar on the right side, before you're greeted by their front-end staff. My favorite cheesecake they offer, currently have 60+ cheesecake flavors and always adding/substituting, is the Banana Cheesecake. It's a cheesecake with a hint of banana flavor with whip cream and fresh bananas cut on top of the cream. So good. If you don't see your favorite cheesecake on there anymore, you should ask to see if they still offer it.  For the quality of the food and immense choices, the price is very reasonable.

281,Emily B.,"Olathe, United States",0,10,,3.0,2016-07-08,"Had lunch there today, it was alright.  My husband and I noticed that the knives, a napkin, and one of the appetizer plates on the table were obviously filthy, so we had to ask for clean replacements right off the bat when we sat down. A short note - they have tons of dishes to choose from, so unless you're a regular or you absolutely love a very specific dish, be prepared to search through a huge (approx. 20 pages) menu. We ordered the (pork?) potsticker dumplings; those were pretty good.  I ordered their 'Factory Burger' for my main meal, and quite frankly, I was disappointed with what I got.  The bread was hard and tough to bite through (unlike the appetizer bread), the onions on the bottom were sort of sad-looking, and while the meat was cooked as ordered, the meal itself didn't come out very hot (unlike the plate).  In hindsight, I should've ordered what my husband had, the 'Bacon-Bacon' burger.  That looked a lot more satisfactory, to be honest. The portion sizes are pretty big, so if you choose to order dessert afterwards, I suggest you get it to-go.  I ordered the Mango Key Lime cheesecake, which tasted lovely (but I do wish they'd cut back on the coconut a little bit).  However, for what it's worth, the prices for just about everything on the menu are...too pricey.  An appetizer (some running about $7-$9) here could get you an -entire meal- elsewhere. As far as service goes, it was decent.  Nothing particularly outstanding or terrible. In short, avoid the 'Factory Burger', it's a total rip-off.  As a whole, the restaurant is a nice treat...once in a while, when you've got the -extra money- to splurge.  It's on the (much?) more expensive end for casual restaurants.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=20,3.6,3.57,3.57,3.34,3.5820000000000003

36,Emily B.,"Olathe, KS",0,10,,3.0,2016-08-07,"Had lunch there today, it was alright.  My husband and I noticed that the knives, a napkin, and one of the appetizer plates on the table were obviously filthy, so we had to ask for clean replacements right off the bat when we sat down. A short note - they have tons of dishes to choose from, so unless you're a regular or you absolutely love a very specific dish, be prepared to search through a huge (approx. 20 pages) menu. We ordered the (pork?) potsticker dumplings; those were pretty good.  I ordered their 'Factory Burger' for my main meal, and quite frankly, I was disappointed with what I got.  The bread was hard and tough to bite through (unlike the appetizer bread), the onions on the bottom were sort of sad-looking, and while the meat was cooked as ordered, the meal itself didn't come out very hot (unlike the plate).  In hindsight, I should've ordered what my husband had, the 'Bacon-Bacon' burger.  That looked a lot more satisfactory, to be honest. The portion sizes are pretty big, so if you choose to order dessert afterwards, I suggest you get it to-go.  I ordered the Mango Key Lime cheesecake, which tasted lovely (but I do wish they'd cut back on the coconut a little bit).  However, for what it's worth, the prices for just about everything on the menu are...too pricey.  An appetizer (some running about $7-$9) here could get you an -entire meal- elsewhere. As far as service goes, it was decent.  Nothing particularly outstanding or terrible. In short, avoid the 'Factory Burger', it's a total rip-off.  As a whole, the restaurant is a nice treat...once in a while, when you've got the -extra money- to splurge.  It's on the (much?) more expensive end for casual restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=20,3.6,3.57,3.57,3.468,3.5820000000000003

I've always had a pleasant experience here and the marble interior with high-ceiling and pillars are a nice touch.  They have their lunch specials every day until 5 p.m. I will say, the menu reads like a chapter book with ads separating the genres of food they offer. So if you're indecisive, tell the waiter you'll need more than a minute. On top of that, they have plenty of awesome dishes to choose from, which doesn't make the process any easier.  I've found that all the pastas, have had them all, are fantastic. My favorite pasta is the Carbonara and Da Vinci.  If you're feeling adventurous, you can have your dessert before your meal. As you walk into the place, they have their cheesecake bar on the right side, before you're greeted by their front-end staff. My favorite cheesecake they offer, currently have 60+ cheesecake flavors and always adding/substituting, is the Banana Cheesecake. It's a cheesecake with a hint of banana flavor with whip cream and fresh bananas cut on top of the cream. So good. If you don't see your favorite cheesecake on there anymore, you should ask to see if they still offer it.  For the quality of the food and immense choices, the price is very reasonable.

O.,"Overland Park, United States",80,174,296.0,3.0,2016-12-02,"Being from a small(er) town, I recall my early experiences with Cheesecake Factory being a BIG DEAL.  When my wife (then-girlfriend) moved to Kansas City from the aforementioned village, nearly every big experience was celebrated with a dinner date out to the Cheesecake Factory on the Country Club Plaza in The Big City.  We gladly suffered through three-hour-and-thirty-minute waits on Saturday night, just to be ""on the Plaza"" and seemingly more awesome than all the pitiful fools we left behind from our misspent (mis-located?) youth. The basics haven't changed in 10 years - nice, clean venues, consistent decor, strong service, enormous menu covering cuisine from all seven continents, and, yes, hunger-pain-inducing long waits on the weekends. My last three visits have all been relatively more of the same, with the exception that each one missed a step in one of the above areas.  On the former two occasions, the food quality had seemingly dropped off a tick. For a decade, I would have rated it 4/5 stars, but it's dropped to 3 - 3.5.  Still strong, especially considering the breadth of menu options the obviously-skilled CF chefs have to be able to create, but down a notch.  Quantity is still enormous, which is to say just fine. On my latest visit, I feel we were slighted on the usual above-average service end of things.  Our waitress was a little more in tune to the pompadour-haired bartender than her waiting duties, both on our table and others'.  You may be thinking, ""But, M.O., you yourself pointed out just how crazy-busy the Cheesecake Factory is!""  Yes, Yelp brethren, while this is normally true, on this occasion it was a mid-winter Thursday evening from 9:00 to 11:00 pm in the bar.  We were but one of three spots in the entire bar area taking up space.  So few tables to tend to should have meant better-than-average service, however we received the opposite.  Nitpicks aside, Cheesecake Factory remains a strong, albeit predictable, choice for a good meal alongside half the metropolitan area.   TIP: Get the cheesecake. Any of them. Obvious, yes, but almost so much so that you might be tempted to eat that entire 14-pound plate of delicious pasta instead of leaving room for dessert.  There's a reason the dessert name made the façade, folks!

After placing our order for the main course we sat for roughly 25 min and was then told that my order( ahi tuna) wasn't in stock. Well that's great but now his food is up and I have nothing to eat. ON MY BIRTHDAY! Great the one time I decided to eat in the only thing the offer is an apology and the meal on them. Honestly it left the worst taste in my mouth because it was the lack of care. The manager only had a cavalier attitude and a ugh so what approach to fixing the problem. Now it's 15 min before midnight with nothing else open in the area. My thought is if they was cooking orders together this would have had been figured out well before that steak had time to cook. We came together, to eat together, and drink together.

The food was good the waitress was great but the manager was not. We have been to this location many times and this time we brought friends with us.  The waitress told us we needed to order or cheesecake early as there was a 30 minute wait two hours later still no cheesecake. We were told by another waitstaff that the manager had drop the orders and did not put them back in the order they were taken. I caught up with the manager and told him my displeasure with our visit.

42,William W.,"Derby, KS",8,1,,1.0,2017-08-16,I made the mistake of going to the cheesecake factory on half-price cheesecake day. The food was good the waitress was great but the manager was not. We have been to this location many times and this time we brought friends with us.  The waitress told us we needed to order or cheesecake early as there was a 30 minute wait two hours later still no cheesecake. We were told by another waitstaff that the manager had drop the orders and did not put them back in the order they were taken. I caught up with the manager and told him my displeasure with our visit.

The only thing I would say is that it gets super busy on some days and they don't take reservations. I ordered the bang bang shrimp and chicken.. It tasted like a curry flavor to me, but still good! Just not what I was expecting what the usual ""bang bang shrimp"" to taste like. We also ordered Korean cauliflower to eat and it's a good replacement for meat! I loved how it tasted with ranch. My friend ordered honey truffle chicken and it was delicious! The chicken was very flavorful. And of course we ordered cheesecake togo...

I was waiting for the bf to grab a jacket because it was chilly and was asked by the waitress our drink orders. I eat here quite often but it's usually to go. Which is what I should have stuck with. I ordered a appetizer salad. That came out in a chilled bowl which was probably the highlight of my meal. After placing our order for the main course we sat for roughly 25 min and was then told that my order( ahi tuna) wasn't in stock. Well that's great but now his food is up and I have nothing to eat. ON MY BIRTHDAY! Great the one time I decided to eat in the only thing the offer is an apology and the meal on them. Honestly it left the worst taste in my mouth because it was the lack of care. The manager only had a cavalier attitude and a ugh so what approach to fixing the problem. Now it's 15 min before midnight with nothing else open in the area. My thought is if they was cooking orders together this would have had been figured out well before that steak had time to cook. We came together, to eat together, and drink together. Which the waitress decided to bring my Arnold palmer once his food was done. By that time I had already got to the level of pisstivity that I couldn't drink it. I AM OFFICIALLY DONE WITH THIS CHAIN TOGETHER. Neither location can seem to get it right and I have spent way to much money, time, and patience in this place.
